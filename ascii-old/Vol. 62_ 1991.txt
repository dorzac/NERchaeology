FOREWORD
With the publication of the 1991 Bulletin of the Texas A rcheological Society
(BTAS), the publications of the Texas Archeological Society are now back on
schedule. I, as well as the previous BTAS Editor Jimmy L. Mitchell, greatly
appreciate the patience of the membership, as well as the BTAS subscribers,
libraries, and authors, who bore the long wait with good humor and grace.
Hopefully, with the regular publication and distribution of the BTAS, we can better
share with others what has been learned about the prehistory and history of Texas
through professional and avocational archeological research, capture the imagination of more people who are interested in the archeology of Texas, and for the
future, increase the membership and voice of the Texas Archeological Society in
our efforts to preserve and protect Texas’ archeological legacy.
With the 1994 receipt of the Deolece-Parmalee Award, the BTAS has recently
been recognized by the Texas Historical Foundation for its long-term and continuing contributions to historical preservation research in Texas (Perttula 1994). I
expect those contributions to continue well into the future.
To kick off the next 65 years of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological
Society, the 1995 BTAS, now in preparation, offers us a propitious opportunity to
take stock of what we know (and do not know) about the archeology of Texas. As
currently envisioned, this special volume will have forewords by eminent Texas
archeologists, contain about 18-20 papers on the archeology of the different
regions of Texas, along with discussions of trends in Texas archeology over the last
50 years or so. These papers will summarize the current state of knowledge for
these areas, and communicate in a single volume our new learning about the
archeological heritage of Texas to interested members of the public, Native
Americans, and professional and avocational archeologists alike.

Uvalde County, Texas, 1990
Henry E. Mueggenborg

ABSTRACT
The Blue Hole site (41UV159) was recorded by a University of Texas at Austin
1989 Summer Archaeological Field School survey team. Located in the upper
Sabinal River Valley, about 13 km south of Utopia, Texas, the large alluvial
terrace evidenced occupations dating from Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric
periods. The site was excavated as a part of the Texas Archeological Society’s
1990 Summer Field School. The goal of the excavation was to define the
stratigraphy of the site in relation to the prehistory of the Sabinal Canyon.
Excavations focused on 1 meter units along intersecting lines, which extended
through a concentrated burned rock midden and into adjacent occupation areas.
Artifacts recovered consisted primarily of lithics dating from the Late Prehistoric to the Middle Archaic period. Detailed information regarding burned rock,
lithic debitage, land snails, and the general stratigraphy of the site have created a
vivid visualization of cultural deposition at the site.

INTRODUCTION
The Blue Hole site (41UV159) is a prehistoric occupation site located on
the Mary K. Kindred Ranch about 13 km south of Utopia, Texas, in northeastern
Uvalde County (Figure 1). Here, the upper Sabinal Valley narrows and the
Sabinal River leaves the Balcones Escarpment, the southernmost limit of the
Edwards Plateau region. The alluvial terraces in this section of the valley contain
numerous prehistoric remains, and the burned rock middens scattered in the area
have long been a favorite source for local artifact collectors.
The University of Texas at Austin (UT) 1989 Summer Archaeological Field
School, directed by Dr. Thomas R. Hester, included daily surface surveys of the
upper Sabinal Valley area that were oriented toward site identification and
recording. Local collections were documented and collectors were interviewed
by Paul Maslyk (1993), who led the survey teams. One of the most popular
collection areas was identified as the burned rock middens adjacent to the "Blue
Hole," a deep, broad pool at a bend in the Sabinal River on the Kindred ranch.
Maslyk obtained permission to survey the area and record the sites. Several days
were spent on general reconnaissance, surface collecting, and recording the
several sites on the ranch. Many sites were associated with burned rock middens,

and the artifacts collected included Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric period lithic
projectile points.
The Blue Hole site was originally recorded as an individual burned rock
midden on a deep alluvial terrace about 100 m east of the Blue Hole. Numerous
collector potholes remained around the perimeter of the site and we later learned
that the southern and western edges of the site had been mechanically (Bobcat
loader and mechanical screen) excavated between 1986-1988.
When the upper Sabinal Valley was selected for the Texas Archeological
Society (TAS) 1990 Summer Field School, Mary K. Kindred granted permission
to excavate the Blue Hole site as a major focus of the field school. The main goal
of the Blue Hole excavations was to define the temporal occupations of the
midden itself, and the adjoining occupation areas, in an attempt to clarify the
local chronology and to further examine the burned rock midden phenomenon in
Central and South Texas archeology.
This paper will first set forth the physical environment at the site, discuss
the archeological background of the general area, and give an account of the field
and laboratory methods employed in the investigation. Since archeology reconstructs the accumulation of cultural deposits, the natural, geologic processes
which contributed to the formation of the site are of particular interest.
These natural processes are then related to the artifacts recovered from the
excavations to establish a relative site chronology consistent with that generally

established for South and Central Texas. The artifacts, consisting primarily of
lithics, are then described and the interrelationships between the burned rock
accumulations, lithic artifacts, and molluscan remains are examined. Finally, the
features are discussed and placed within the site’s temporal framework.

ENVIRONMENT
Physical Setting
The upper Sabinal Valley follows the southerly flow of the Sabinal River
through the Balcones Escarpment. The escarpment’s position at the edge of the
Edwards Plateau region places it between two of the grand physiographic divisions of North America, the Great Plains province to the west and the Coastal
Plains to the east and south (Jordan et al. 1984). In Central Texas, this major
physiographic break is denoted by the change from the Hill Country on the
westward side of the escarpment to the Blackland Prairie on the east. With the
Blue Hole site situated at the southern edge of the Balcones Escarpment, the
South Texas Coastal Plain spreads immediately to the south, while the area to the
north is in the Edwards Plateau.

Hydrology
The Sabinal River, because of its position with respect to other streams of
the region (the Frio River to the west and the Medina to the east) and the positions of their head streams, obtains very little of its discharge from the limestone of the Edwards Plateau. Most of its water comes from rainfall runoff and
seep springs in the Glen Rose formation. Consequently, the flow of the Sabinal
River is relatively slight and is subject to rapid fluctuations. The relatively small
flow of the river is further lost into fissures and fault planes near the Blue Hole
where the Sabinal crosses the Balcones fault zone (Mear 1953). Thus, during
the drier summer months, with the exception of unusual precipitation, the
Sabinal River ceases to flow. However, it does maintain large quantities of water
in the deeper entrenchments, such as the Blue Hole, that occur in the main river
channel.
The Sabinal has many asymmetrical meanders which are separated by long
straight portions of the river, and these meanders create rich alluvial terrace
deposits with the sudden and short-lived floods characteristic of the river (Mear
1953). These terrace deposits result in an enriched environment with more productive floral species, but they would further have provided the prehistoric inhabitants with elevated habitation sites adjacent to a water source.

Geology

The Geologic Atlas of Texas depicts the entire upper Sabinal Valley as
"Quaternary deposits undivided" including "slope wash, alluvial fan deposits,
alluvium, colluvium, and locally older Quaternary deposits; mostly in the size
range of cobbles to silt derived from Cretaceous limestone, dolomite, and chert"
(Barnes 1983). The entire watershed is bounded by the Glen Rose Formation,
consisting of about 122 m thick beds of "limestone, dolomite, and marl as
alternating resistant and recessive beds forming stairstep topography." The Glen
Rose formation, which extends several miles from the central valley region and a
few hundred meters at the southern confluence, is then bounded by the Edwards
Limestone, specifically Devil’s River Limestone. Acording to Barnes (1983),
this is a "limestone and dolomite, hard, miliolid, pellet, rudistid, shell fragment
biosparite and lime mudstone; locally dolomitized, brecciated, and chert bearing;
rudistid mounds more common in upper part; nodular limestone in basal part;
thickness about 700 feet (213 meters)."
Selection of sites for early human habitation was at least partially influenced by a quality source of chert raw material for tools. Banks (1990) identified
the Devil’s River formation as one of the three principal chert-bearing units in
the Edwards Group. In addition, the Uvalde gravel, composed of pebbles and
cobbles of chert with some limestone in a calcareous mix, occurs naturally in the
low rolling hills that outcrop below the Balcones Escarpment, but 61-91 m
above modern stream levels (Mear 1953). However, it is generally accepted that
the better quality chert was obtained from the upper Edwards areas or from
Edwards gravels in the river bottom.
The general soil map from the Soil Survey of Uvalde County, Texas
(Stevens and Richmond 1976:5), describes the floodplain of the upper Sabinal
valley as "nearly level to gently sloping and undulating to hilly, very shallow to
shallow and stony, clayey and loamy soils." The alluvial terrace which encases
the Blue Hole Site consists entirely of"young but not recent Conalb loam, a fineloamy, carbonatic, hyperthermic Inceptisol" (Stevens and Richmond 1976:97).

Flora and Fauna
Blair (1950) placed the upper Sabinal Valley at the southern limit of the
Balconian, or Edwards Plateau, biotic province, with the Tamaulipan province
immediately to the south. The most characteristic plant association in the
Balconian is the scrub forest of Mexican cedar, Texas oak, and stunted live oak,
interspersed with less numerous species. To the south, thorny brush, including
mesquite and prickly pear, predominates in the Tamaulipan. The vertebrate fauna
of the Balconian is an intermixture of species found generally to the north, west,
and south of the province whereas the Tamaulipan species are more representative of provinces to the east of the Balconian. While both provinces contain vast
floral and faunal resources, it is significant that the upper Sabinal Valley is

Henry E. Mueggenborg ~ Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

located at a natural ecotone, or transitional zone; human populations are able to
exploit the faunal and floral resources common to each respective province.
The floodplain of the present day upper Sabinal Valley characteristically
has been cleared, and is either cultivated or improved grassland, or has been
reclaimed by low mesquite and low shrubs, prickly pear cactus, and native
grasses. The lower areas nearer the rivers and streams have concentrations of
large pecan, oak, and elm trees while the rockier elevations support rather dense
populations of live oak, mesquite, and cedar. The Blue Hole site itself sits upon a
partially cleared alluvial terrace, with the lower slopes supporting numerous
large native pecan, elm, and oak trees (Figure 2).

Climate
Uvalde County has a subtropical climate with dry winters and hot, humid
summers. The present day upper Sabinal Valley receives an annual average of
59.6 cm of rainfall and enjoys a 255 day growing season (Texas Almanac 1989).

During the Wisconsin glacial period (20,000-12,000 B.C.), the area "was
considerably cooler and more humid than today" (Bryant and Holloway 1985:50),
and was covered with grasslands, woodlands, and parklands including species of
spruce and pine. Faunal records contain extinct species--such as the long nosed
peccary and the mastodon-- generally thought to inhabit cool, humid forests
(Graham 1976). A slow climatic deterioration, with drier and warmer conditions,
probably occurred between 12,000-8000 B.C., as the spruce and pine gradually
gave way to grasslands (Black 1989:13). The Pleistocene and the accompanying
Ice Age came to an end somewhere between 8000-7000 B.C.
Following what appears to have been a relatively long, gradual trend toward
warmer temperatures and drier conditions (Bryant and Shafer 1977), the vegetation communities are believed to have become generally similar to those of today
by about 550 B.C. By that time, the grasslands and oak savannas of South
Central Texas had been established. Along with the plentiful food source of the
acorn, bison proliferated in the region by around 1000 B.C. (Dillehay 1974). This
gradual increase of floral and faunal resources, and the year-long reliability of
the white-tailed deer and smaller game species as food sources, resulted in the
growth of human populations and their expansion into more diverse geographical
regions (Hester 1980).

ARCHEOLOGICALBACKGROUND
South Central Texas Chronology
While the division of human prehistory into time frames, and the naming
and calibration of these time frames, has caused considerable debate among
archeologists, the basic periods as used in Texas are divided by changes in
lifeways, subsistence patterns, settlement, and technology. Consequently, the
division between these "periods" is most often transitional in one aspect (for
instance, technology), while other aspects of culture appear to remain relatively
constant. The commonly accepted periods or stages are listed below for South
Central Texas (Turner and Hester 1985:47-53):

When studying certain parameters of Central Texas archeology, particularly
temporal assignments of site occupations, projectile points and other tools are
common and reliable indicators. Consequently, any archeological investigation
relies heavily upon established projectile point typologies for understanding
chronology. While point typology is not necessarily indicative of cultural change,
the ability to link projectile point types to a particular period and area, and their
validation in this regard by absolute and relative dating methods, makes this
chronology particularly useful. Toward this goal, Suhm et al. (1954) published a
widely accepted taxonomy of Texas stone artifacts, which has been subsequently
refined by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Weir (1976), Prewitt (1981), and Turner and
Hester (1985). Continuing archeological investigations will help to more closely
define the temporal and regional typological associations of projectile points (see
Johnson and Goode 1994), especially with the collation of radiocarbon dates in
association with these lithic artifacts (e.g., Prewitt 1985; Black and McGraw
1985:324). Consequently, this paper will generally follow the South Central
Texas point typology in establishing the vertical stratigraphy of the site, and in
comparing those occupational patterns with other relevant site excavation data.

Comparative Studies
Prior to the 1970s, little had been published pertinent to the archeology of
Uvalde County and immediately adjacent counties. However, several reports
have since appeared, and recent excavations have been undertaken, and these
have helped clarify and define the prehistoric occupation of the general area.
The Paleoindian period remains relatively undocumented, but Archaic cultural
remains are much more common, as evidenced by the number of burned rock
middens and terrace sites present in the proximity of the Blue Hole site itself.
The burned rock midden phenomenon, discussed below, is a common Central
Texas occurrence particular to the Middle and Late Archaic periods. The Late
Prehistoric period is marked primarily by the introduction of the bow and arrow, and arrowpoints are extensively represented in area surface collections and
stratigraphically above earlier Archaic occupations in excavated assemblages.
The following excavations are representative of the recent studies from the area,
and are thus of particular relevance in placing the Blue Hole site in its regional
context.

Kincaid Rock Shelter
Generally, the earliest human occupation in the area is represented by
occasional surface finds of Late Paleoindian projectile points. However, Collins
et al. (1989) reported a stone pavement lens clearly associated with a Clovis
occupation at the Kincaid rockshelter, about 24 km downstream from the Blue
Hole site in Uvalde County. Collins (1990) further reported six distinct geological

8

zones at the shelter which included some Late Prehistoric artifacts, the complete
Archaic sequence, and both Folsom and Clovis Paleoindian occupations.

La Jita Site (41UV21)

About 8 km up the Sabinal River from Blue Hole, the burned rock middens
and adjacent occupation areas of the La Jita site were excavated in 1967 (Hester
1971). Although occupations from the Early Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods were represented, the Middle and Late Archaic occupations are of
particular relevance to the Blue Hole site, because of geographic proximity, the
artifact assemblages, and their relationships to the burned rock middens. Eighteen radiocarbon dates were obtained from the Late and Transitional Archaic
through the Late Prehistoric period occupations. The most recent La Jita excavations (1989 UT Field School and 1990 TAS Field School) concentrated on
the Late Prehistoric occupations, and recovered primarily Toyah phase Perdiz
arrowpoints, beveled bifaces, and end scrapers, as well as an assortment of
sherds from Leon Plain pottery in association with bison bone (Huebner 1990).

Smith Site (41UV132)
The 1989 excavations of the burned rock midden and adjacent occupation
areas at the Smith site on the west bank of the Sabinal, about 1.5 km upstream
from the La Jita site, revealed substantial Early Archaic occupations. Charcoal
in association with an in situ hearth was radiocarbon dated and calibrated to
6307 + 90 B.P. or 4357 + 90 B.C. (Hester 1990; calibrated following Stuiver
and Reimer [1986]), and a number of associated Early Archaic projectile points
were found in the strata underlying the Middle Archaic occupations. A major
Middle Archaic component was excavated in association with the burned rock
midden, but the Late Archaic occupation was sparse and no Late Prehistoric
artifacts were recovered. The 1990 TAS Field School excavations at the Smith
site were directed at the deeper Early Archaic deposits and hearth complexes
(Smith 1990).

Leona River Watershed, Four Sites in Uvalde County
Located about 40 km southwest of the Blue Hole site, the four sites included five burned rock middens and a quarry area (Lukowski 1987). Based on
intersite comparisons of the five burned rock middens, and the associated radiocarbon dates, Lukowski proposed that the burned rock middens extended into
much later temporal periods than was initially believed. Certain projectile point
types similarly appeared to extend temporally beyond generally accepted time
ranges.

Henry E. Mueggenborg m Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

Luce Middens (41UV20, 22, and 23 )

These three burned rock middens, located in the northwestern corner of
Uvalde County adjacent to the Nueces River, contained artifacts attributable to
the Middle Archaic period. The zones above the burned rock deposits yielded
Late and Transitional Archaic through Late Prehistoric period artifacts (Hester
1970). The sites had been heavily disturbed by collectors, and the zone strata and
chronologies were established from the visual inspection of the sites, as well as
from the collected artifacts and their reported approximate proveniences.

Salado Creek Watershed Site (41BX300)
Situated at the southeastern perimeter of the Balcones Escarpment, about
105 km due east of the Blue Hole site, 41BX300 was excavated in Bexar County
in 1978 (Katz 1987). The excavations yielded diagnostic projectile points that
clearly placed the burned rock midden in the Late Archaic period, with a substantial Transitional Archaic occupation in the strata above the burned rock midden.
No conclusive absolute dates were obtained, however, to substantiate either the
relative dating of the artifacts or the burned rock midden.

Panther Creek Springs Site (41BX228)
The 1979 excavations at Panther Creek Springs, located about l0 km southWest of 41BX300, indicated its intermittent occupation over at least 5,000 years,
beginning in the Early Archaic period (Black and McGraw 1985). The deposits
and artifacts were placed into an 11-phase local chronology, and radiocarbon
dates were obtained from the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods, as well as
from Late Prehistoric period deposits, to support the chronology.

The Burned Rock Midden
There is continued discussion regarding the origin of burned rock middens
(BRMs) in Centra! Texas, although there is general consensus that they date
primarily to the Middle and Late Archaic periods. These middens are large
accumulations of fire-cracked and discolored limestone (Hester 199!). Early
theories explained the BRM as an accumulation of abandoned hearths, but Hester
(1971) reported that the accumulation at La Jita appeared to be a "rubble dump"
where the broken-up hearth stones were cleared and dumped on a conveniently
placed pile. It appears that prehistoric populations congregated repeatedly at
favored locations to engage in a cooking process that used limestone which was
then abandoned or discarded in piles.
Although Weir (1976) defined four types of BRM that occur in Central
Texas, the excavations at the Blue Hole site involve a midden of Weir’s Type 1, a

10

Texas Archeological Society

dome-shaped accumulation from 0.45-2 m or more in maximum thickness. In
addition, several other BRMs were recorded near the Blue Hole site but they
were not excavated.
Artifacts and other cultural remains vary in BRMs from site to site. As with
most of the BRMs in Central Texas, the acidic soils of the upper Sabinal Valley
prohibit preservation of most of the associated food items, but the occurrence
of charred acorns at 41BN63 (Thomas R. Hester, personal communication
1990), deer bones, mussel shells, and a variety of snail shells at other BRM sites
support the "cooking location" theory. Projectile points and other lithic tools
are sometimes found within the concentration of burned rocks and black soil
matrix, whereas other middens produce only burned rock.
The most popular theory regarding the formation of the BRM revolves
around utilization of acorns. Black (1989:19-20) discussed the positive distributional correlation of BRMs to that of the oak savannah (see also Creel 1991),
and argues that the rock accumulations are a result of the processing of acorns
(to remove the tannic acid and!or enhance preservation) by stone boiling or other
cooking methods. Turner (1989) examined ethnohistoric data from aboriginal
cultures in other areas of North America to propose that similar use of the acorn
as a staple was likely common in Central Texas in Middle through Late Archaic times. Goode (1991) has demonstrated that BRMs are now known to have
been used into the Late Prehistoric period.
Regardless of the specific or varied purpose of the BRM, their abundance
in the upper Sabinal Valley, and the general Central Texas area, and their use
over 1,500-3,000 years, substantiates the proliferation of human populations
during the Middle through Late Archaic periods. It is this indication of increased
population density that prods us to continue exploring the BRM for more definitive reconstructions of the cultures of these early inhabitants of the region.

FIELD METHODS
The 1989 UT Summer Field School survey teams recorded the Blue Hole
site as a single BRM and adjacent occupational area perhaps 100 m wide (north
to south) and 200 m long (east to west). While no shovel tests or test excavations were performed either in 1989, or in advance of the TAS Field School, the
surface scatter of burned rocks, the partially exposed potholes, and the location
of the artifacts that were recovered in 1989, gave us a relatively reliable definition of the horizontal and vertical limits of the site.
In 1990, a week prior to the commencement of the TAS Field School, a
crew of eight graduate students from The University of Texas at Austin went to
the Blue Hole site, and other sites selected for TAS excavations, to inspect, map,
and prepare the sites for excavation. Heavy and consistent rains in March and
April of 1990 created a dense grass and weed cover over the site. A tractor and
shredder were hired to mow the site and perimeter; the site was cleared of brush,

and low overhanging branches were removed. Permanent horizontal and vertical datums were established along with a site grid, and the entire terrace encompassing the site was mapped using a transit (Figure 3).

As our excavation plan, and eventual interpretation of the site, would rely
heavily on geomorphological interpretations of the deposits themselves, a crew
of UT students began a test unit at N 113W102 (S 1 in Figure 3), proceeding down
the north slope of the terrace to N116W102, in 1 meter wide units. The excavation methods employed, and the findings of this and subsequent units excavated
for geomorphological purposes, are addressed later in this paper.
Since the TAS Field School would involve excavations at four prehistoric
sites, and a number of historic investigations, a detailed Technical Procedures
Manual (Mueggenborg 1990) had been prepared for distribution to all field
school participants upon arrival. While the excavation techniques varied somewhat from site to site depending on the excavation goals, uniform bagging,
recording, and laboratory procedures were set forth to control the anticipated
volume of data and artifact recovery. The discussion below describes the specific
procedures used at the Blue Hole site.
The basic metric grid system was used at the site for horizontal control, with
units progressing to the north and west from the primary datum (see Figure 3).
Grid North was set at Magnetic North. Vertical measurements were stated as
distances above or below the primary datum set arbitrarily at 100 m. Elevation
reference stakes were designated for each unit, and string lines were used to
measure vertical levels and the provenience of all significant artifacts and features. Crews were assigned to 1 m units and all 10 cm levels were dug to even 10
cm elevation readings (i.e., bottom of each level was 99.60 cm or 99.50 cm, for
example). This uniformity is important when evaluating the computer-generated
reconstructions of site deposition presented later in this paper.
Crews consisted generally of five individuals, one of whom was designated
as the recorder for each level. Standard level forms insured consistency in
information and format. All matrix was screened using a 1/4-inch screen, and
artifacts (lithic debitage, land snails, bone, charcoal, mussel shell, etc.) were
bagged by level. All projectile points or other particularly meaningful artifacts
were provenienced and recorded and bagged separately. None of the typologically diagnostic projectile points were washed, either in the field or laboratory, to
facilitate possible future residue analysis. Burned rocks were weighed, recorded,
and discarded.
Crew Chiefs were supervised by four Area Supervisors, who monitored the
overall progress and consistency of the excavations. The method of excavation
varied somewhat with the circumstances and personnel involved but, generally,
careful shoveling or trowelling was employed until particularly significant artifacts or concentrations were found in the screen, or features were identified, at
which time more meticulous care was used. Two Site Secretaries issued and
controlled all level bags and artifacts recovered.
TAS Site Directors Dr. E. Mott Davis and James H. Word met with the
author and Dr. Hester on June 8, and we selected areas for excavation as well as
general goals and strategies. Hester (1971:127) had suggested that the excavation
of BRMs should concentrate not only on the BRM proper but also on peripheral

Henry E. Mueggenborg ~ Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

13

areas outside the BRM. Black (1989:19-20) similarly suggested implementing
more comprehensive research designs than the standard approaches of either
mining the midden for large collections of artifacts, or scattering test pits within
and around the midden. Toward this end, our main strategy was to excavate 2 m
units along two intersecting lines that extended from beyond the perimeter of the
midden accumulation into the midden proper. This broad view of the site deposits, as evidenced in the exposed profiles of the units, was to meet our primary
objective: the reconstruction of the BRM cultural deposits.
Excavations commenced on June 9, 1990, at 7:30 A.M., by the approximately 150 individuals assigned to the Blue Hole site. It became obvious that
there was a degree of disturbance in certain areas (based on the chronological
intermixture of recovered projectile point types), but excavations continued since
certain surficial disturbances had been anticipated at the site.
As work was finishing for the day, a local collector arrived who had
mechanically excavated portions of the site. He indicated that certain units were
within the confines of his previous excavations. Although the site had been
subjected to pothunting, the heavy vegetation on the terrace had made it impossible to delineate the bounds of any disturbance other than the remaining potholes. The collector indicated that he had used a Bobcat loader to excavate
portions of the site to depths of 3 m and that he had backfilled and smoothed the
surface of the site over a year prior to the UT 1989 survey. He was very
cooperative and interested in our scientific approach to the reconstruction of the
site, and he detailed the horizontal confines and approximate depths of his
excavations. The net result of the first work day was the misdirection of the
entire excavation force. In retrospect, it was fortunate that the local collector
defined the limits of his potholes when he did. Otherwise, controlled tests would
have been needed to define the limits of the disturbed area before further TAS
excavations could have continued.
The Site Directors met with Dr. Hester, and the excavation plan was adjusted to exclude the previously disturbed areas. Excavations commenced again,
early on June 10, concentrating on 2 m wide units along north-south lines to
intersect at grid coordinate N106W110. The N106 line was staggered at W100 to
keep the excavations close to the perimeter of the terrace while maintaining its
east-west orientation (Figure 4). The artifact recovery rate was intense as the
excavations progressed through Monday, June 11. A tremendous amount of time
was consumed in delays to log all bifacial lithic artifacts as "unique items," the
designation for any artifact which required proveniencing and might become
particularly relevant in later analysis. The Site Directors and Crew Chiefs met
that Monday evening and decided on a "semi-unique" category for non-diagnostic projectile points and other artifacts which, in a less productive site, would rate
a higher priority. We continued to provenience any "semi-unique" items found in
situ, with the Area Supervisors approving the classifications as to "unique" or
"semi-unique." The "semi-unique" items were then expediently bagged together
by unit level. As the week progressed, the number of excavators decreased

somewhat, and by Wednesday, June 13, all excavations were concentrated in 1 m
wide lines at N106 and W110, eliminating the complementary 1 m units which
had previously made up the 2 m wide excavation plan.
The excavations continued on the N106 and W110 lines through Saturday,
June 16, the final day of the TAS Field School. Certain of the 1 m units had
been completed to near-sterile depths while others were barely started (Figure
5). Plans had been made for a number of volunteers to return over the Labor
Day weekend to continue excavations. Several crew members stayed over
through Monday to complete wall profiles and photographs in the event of dis-

turbance prior to our return; the units were covered and protected with tarps and
plywood covering.
The TAS operated a field laboratory at the Utopia camp area, and the lab
processed the unit bags, to the extent possible, including washing and counting
the lithic debitage, counting the land snails, and confirming the field identifications of projectile point types. The daily feedback from lab personnel was
invaluable in limiting and correcting inconsistencies in procedures, and for monitoring the progress of the excavations. The unit bags not completed at the TAS
Field School were completed by UT students during the summer of 1990.
Mr. Bob Vernon, a TAS member who now resides in Massachusetts and
who had excavated at the Blue Hole site throughout the field school, volunteered
his computer expertise and services in plotting data charts for analysis and planning purposes. Prior to the Labor Day effort, his charts helped graphically reconstruct the field school excavations by showing concentrations of burned rock,
land snails, and lithic debitage in cross-views of the units. These data, together
with the location of features and other artifact concentrations, were the basis
for the selection of units for further excavations over Labor Day.
Approximately 60 TAS members returned for Labor Day excavations between August 31-September 2. A great deal of additional progress was made
during the three days but, as is commonly the case, not all excavation goals were
met (Figure 6). Again, profiles were drawn and photographs of each unit wall
were taken. Core samples were taken to 3 m below excavated levels in selected
units for possible future analysis. Plastic liners were placed in the units and they
were mechanically backfilled.

TERRACE GEOMORPHOLOGY
Methods
Since archeology relies on the physical location of artifacts and their spatial relationships to other cultural remains to establish their significance, it is
paramount that any excavation be planned in relation to the site’s geomorphological depositional framework. Proper interpretation of depositional processes,
and the relative position and age of the site strata, independent of occupational
debris, permits the formulation of more scientific excavation objectives and
strategies.
The Upper Sabinal River Valley was the subject of Mear’s (1953) master’s
thesis. He identified the alluvial terrace formations of the valley with numerical
assignations as follows: Q0, Q1 and Q2 (Holocene alluvium); and Q3 and Q4
(Pleistocene gravel terraces). Describing the deposits by their composition and
color, Mear noted that the alluvial deposits created a stair-step sequence down to
the present river channel, with the higher terrace deposits generally being older.
Using not only environmental data evident in the deposits, but also temporally

diagnostic cultural artifacts found in association, the Q2 and Q1 deposits were
thought to span the Middle and Late Archaic periods.
To improve the definition of these Holocene geologic strata, an initial
geomorphological test was conducted at the Blue Hole Site in advance of the
TAS Field School excavations. This test (S-I), proceeding in 1 m units down the
north slope of the terrace at N113W102, was excavated in 50 cm levels using
shovels. The matrix was screened using a 1/4-inch screen, and the artifacts
recovered were bagged and logged using regular procedures.
Basic records were maintained regarding the general location of the burned
rock. concentrations and the recovered artifacts, but our primary goal was to
expose the vertical profile of the test. In addition to the geomorphological
profile, the preliminary evaluation of the artifacts recovered, and their relative
location, helped define and clarify initial excavation strategies. The profile of
this test unit (Figure 7) was:

The initial geomorphological interpretation of Unit S-1 was performed by
Gene Mear, Dr. Michael B. Collins, and Michael D. Blum. They found the
terrace deposits consistent with Mear’s Q2 and Q1 depositional episodes, with
the more recent Q0 lying on the lower terrace between the site and the Sabinal
River.
Coincident with the TAS excavations on the N106 and W110 lines, additional geomorphotogical tests were excavated at N113W102 (S-I), at a 1 m unit
(N 120W148, S-2), and a lx2 m unit (N233W244, S-3). These units were selected
by the visiting geomorphologists to evaluate depositional variation across the
terrace, but moving away from the river. The recovered artifacts and stratigraphic profiles of these test units confirmed the initial horizontal definition of
the BRM proper, but, generally, no additional information was discovered to
warrant any change in site excavation strategies. After the profiles were recorded
and interpreted by the geomorphologists, tests S-2 and S-3 were backfilled at the
completion of the regular TAS Field School.
To facilitate more complete geomorphological interpretations of the terrace,
11 backhoe trenches were excavated at the site on July 6th (see Figure 3). Each
unit was dug as a narrow trench at least 50 cm into the Q2 alluvium. No
screening or other artifact recovery methods were used since the goal was to
expose the unit profiles for geomorphological interpretation (Table 1). On July
13, Blum returned to the site, reviewed the units, and recorded his geomorphological interpretations of the terrace (Blum 1990).

Interpretations
According to Blum (1990), the main body of the Blue Hole site sediments,
which extend vertically at least 5 m below the surface, consists of the Q2
alluvium. This alluvium was deposited as a constructional floodplain surface
during the Early to Middle Holocene period. Radiocarbon dates from other
drainages of the Balcones Escarpment area of the Edwards Plateau indicate these
Q2 deposits date from 10,000-5000 B.P. After deposition ended, the river
downcut slightly and abandoned the floodplain and began to deposit the Q1
alluvium, which makes up the terrace nearer the present river channel to the
south of the Blue Hole site. These Q1 deposits probably date from 4500-1000
B.P. Each of these two major stratigraphic units of the Holocene represent long
periods of time when the river was migrating laterally and aggrading vertically,
constructing the floodplain laterally from the channel.

Figure 7. Geomorphological Test S I at N113W102. The profile shows the burned rock
accumulation of the main excavation area overlying the Q2 alluvium.

Due to the periods of time involved, each of these depositional units contains a wide variety of facies, or environmentally specific types of deposits.
Depending on the duration and severity of flood episodes, older deposits were
overtopped with thin veneers of alluvium from the latest episodes. Similarly,
the older Q2 deposits were implaced with thin veneers of Q1. This more naturally occurs near valley confluences or constrictions, such as the Blue Hole
location, where flood waters back up and attain a higher level than they would
in an open valley.
The earliest archeological remains from sites in the Sabinal Valley are
found, in terms of their geologic context, within Q2 deposits. Although

~Relative to site’s primary vertical datum at 100 meters.
2At 150 cm, more recent Q1 depositions were still evident.
3Gravel facies exposed at 90 cm.

Paleoindian habitation debris is occasionally recovered in the valley, the major
floodplain accumulations from 10,000 to 5000 B.P. lessen the likelihood of
identifying a discrete Paleoindian occupation. However, the Early Archaic
peoples who visited or resided in the area did so on the still active floodplain.
The record of their activities remains vertically segregated within these facies
as the deposition of Q2 deposits gradually diminished in the Early Holocene.
The boundary between the Q2 and the Q1 terrace veneer facies is generally
marked by a soil profile that developed in Q2 sediments during a period of
landscape stability. It is this partially buried soil that was the surface upon which
the BRMs accumulated at Blue Hole. During this period of stability, the Middle
through Late Archaic, there was only minor sedimentation. The period of stability
is marked by soil development, and this soil development is accelerated in the
BRMs themselves, due to the anthropogenic nature of the matrix derived from
processing plant foods and other such activities. Thus, the Q2 terrace at the Blue

Henry E. Mueggenborg ~ Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

21

Hole site became a reasonably discrete soil comprised of thin, periodic, veneer
sediment deposits and the cultural debris of the inhabitants.
Of particular importance to the BRM atop the Q2 terrace is the Q1 terrace
adjacent to, and below, the site toward the river. Gully exposures into this Q 1
terrace indicate it contains major gravelly facies. Thus, the Middle Archaic
peoples had a source for limestone cobbles about 40 m away.
After sorting through the discarded burned rock piles, we determined that
all of the limestone cobbles used in the BRM were rounded and tumbled from
flood deposition. The only angular edges on the discarded rocks appeared to be
from heat fracture. This differs from many BRM sites in the Edwards Plateau
where the prehistoric occupants appeared to favor proximity to bluffs with a
good exposure of thin bedded limestone as the source material. The limestone in
the bluffs to the east of the Blue Hole site is relatively thick bedded, and would
need to be broken up prior to use to be suitable for campfires and hearths.
The earliest record of human occupation at the Blue Hole site, at depths that
we were able to reach, is buried in the deeper facies of the Q2, where the Early
Archaic campers sought the concentrated resources at the valley confluence. As
the terrace land surface stabilized in the Middle Archaic, a BRM accumulated
over a long period of time, with only occasional, thin alluvial deposits interrupting the anthropogenic soil development. As the river channel continued to aggrade, increased surface stability at Blue Hole compressed the Transitional
Archaic and Late Prehistoric archeological record into a palimpsest, or very thin
layer, atop the terrace surface.

SITE STRATIGRAPHY
Except for occasional instances of rodent or surficial disturbances, the
projectile points recovered from Blue Hole are indicative of excellent temporal
stratification, according to the generally accepted South Central Texas chronologies (cf. Black and McGraw 1985). Although no obvious stratigraphy or clearly
defined occupation floors were evident, the burned rock concentrations, the
geomorphological deposition, the recovery of diagnostic projectile points, and
other temporally significant artifacts show a well defined vertical sequence from
the Late Prehistoric through the Middle Archaic. Cultural material was still being
recovered through the deepest excavated levels, but restrictions on the length of
time we could pursue the excavations prevented continuing the excavations into
possible earlier occupation periods. However, the core samples taken to 3 m
below the floor of selected excavated units displayed no marked color changes
within the Q2 alluvium. The radiocarbon date associated with the hearth in
Feature 6 (discussed below) also substantiates the stratigraphic record.
To visually reconstruct site deposition patterns, the data regarding the
burned rock, chert debitage, and Rabdotus (the predominant, large land snails)
recovered from levels in units on the designated N106 and W110 lines were

22

Texas Archeological Society

plotted by computer onto cross-sections of the units.~ Concentrations of these
artifacts in the units or levels which were not excavated (those not excavated
are shaded in the plot of diagnostic artifacts in Figures 9, 11, and 13) were interpolated from the immediately adjacent units. In addition, the 268 diagnostic
projectile points, and all of the "semi-unique" items, were plotted onto similar
cross-sections to examine changes through time in each of the excavation areas
by artifact type. The left column of the following plots designates the 10 cm
levels measured relative to the site’s primary vertical datum. The burned rock
scattergrams (4 dots = 1 kg), and the unique item plots, are shown as follows:
N106 - W86-W98 (Figures 8-9); N106 - W98-W110 (Figures 10-11); and W110
- N94-N106 (Figures 12-13). Table 2 indexes each of the diagnostic point types
to the figures.
Based on the plotting onto the cross-sectional views of the diagnostic
projectile points (see Figures 9, 11, and 13), the burned rock accumulations (see
Figures 8, 10, and 12), and the soil color changes noted in the unit level records,
lines were drawn onto the cross-views to segregate the undefined strata of the site
into the following chronological/cultural levels:

Late Prehistoric (after A.D. 700): this period is represented by the
cultural materials extending downward from the ground surface to the
first (uppermost) solid line (A) drawn across the profiles. No historic
artifacts were recovered in the uppermost deposits of the site.
Late Archaic (A.D. 700 through 1000 B.C.): this period is represented
by the area between lines A and B. The Transitional Archaic (A.D.
700 through 300 B.C.) was not considered in establishing Line A since
the predominant points attributed to the Transitional Archaic in this
geographic area are the Frio/Ensor types, which are the focus of a
separate analysis later in this paper. These Frio and Ensor types displayed much variation within the otherwise clear site stratigraphy.
Middle Archaic (1000 B.C. through 2500 B.C.): this period is represented by the area below line B. A few Paleoindian and Early Archaic
points were recovered in these Middle Archaic deposits.

Units on the designated lines NI06 and W110 were subjected to in-depth laboratory
and interpretational analysis since these units were the focus of the excavations. All other
artifacts recovered from the first day’s excavations of the disturbed areas, from units
adjacent to the N106 and W! 10 units, or from the geomorphological units, were retained
unprocessed and are stored at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory for future
research purposes.

To define lines A and B, paramount consideration was given to the
diagnostic projectile points, since they most clearly define the temporal
occupations. There is ambiguity in the placement of line A, because the primary
Transitional Archaic markers (Ensor (E) and Frio (F) types) displayed temporal
variation. Using transparencies of Figures 8, 10, and 12, the burned rock
scattergrams were then superimposed over those of the diagnostic projectile
points, and the lines were adjusted slightly at various places to distinguish:
o Lighter accumulations of burned rock in the Middle Archaic with occasional
heavier concentrations due to hearth formations.
¯ The main burned rock accumulation in the Late Archaic, virtually uninterrnpted by alluvial deposition.
o Some scattered burned rock in the Late Prehistoric period.
The lines, A and B, thus established were then compared to similar charts
denoting the matrix color at the bottom of each unit level, and the hand drawn
profiles of the unit walls (on file at TARL). Other than minor strata with light
Q1 or Q0 facies deposition, or root or rodent disturbances, no additional
differences were noted to warrant further adjustment of the A and B lines.

There were a few anomalies noted in the otherwise consistent stratigraphy.
In the N106 line at W106-108, three dart projectile points (Plainview (S), Nolan
(O), and La Jita (N)) were recovered in Late Prehistoric deposits. The level notes
indicate a high degree of rodent disturbance in this area and at depths that were
characterized by very little burned rock and a fine loamy soil. Conversely,
N106W106 yielded three Late Prehistoric projectile points from level 6 (99.4099.30). The unit level records, however, clearly indicate two major animal burrows, with radii of approximately 15 cm, extending vertically through the unit,
intermixing lighter Q2 matrix with Late Prehistoric deposits.
In the W110 line at N97-99, two Pedernales (K) and a Uvalde (Q) are
clearly transposed into or near the Late Prehistoric strata. While the unit level
records mention no major rodent disturbances at these levels, it is possible they
were intermingled with the later strata by animals, or people, during later periods. The Perdiz (A) found in level 7 (99.10-99.00) of N98W110 was noted as
"possibly from a cave-in of an adjacent unit" at the surface level. Root and
rodent disturbances were noted in N96W110, level 10, which produced an
Edwards (D) point. Based on the general stratigraphy established by the 268
diagnostic projectile points (see Figures 9, 11, and 13) and the other relative
data, these anomalies do not detract from the overall reconstructed cultural
stratigraphy at Blue Hole.

THE ARTIFACTS
Artifacts recovered from the excavation of the units on the intersecting
N106 and Wll0 lines were separated into the following broad categories:
Chipped Stone Artifacts (including typologically diagnostic Projectile Points,
Other Stone Tools, and Chert Debitage), and Other Artifacts. This section briefly
describes the various classes of artifacts under each of these categories, in
addition to the Molluscan remains recovered from the units.

Chipped Stone Artifacts
Projectile Points
The 268 typologically diagnostic projectile points recovered from the intersecting N106 and W110 trenches were generally sorted using Turner and Hester
(1985). Those projectile points which were not clearly identifiable as a particular
type were included as distal, proximal, or other bifacial fragments in plotting the
"Semi-Unique" Items in "Other Stone Tools." Where specimens were incomplete, and it was possible to reasonably estimate the quantitative measurements
but weight of the complete specimen, those estimations were made. Weights
shown are in grams and are abbreviated as WT. All measurements are in mm

width; and, MT: maximum thickness. References to "Unique Item" numbers
exceed the 268 diagnostic items since a total of 514 artifacts were logged as
"Unique Items," including those not from the main excavation units, and nondiagnostic artifacts which evidenced particularly meaningful relationships to
other diagnostic artifacts and features.

Arrowpoints
Sixty-six arrowpoints were found, including Perdiz, Sabinal, Scallorn, and
Edwards (Figure 14). The Late Prehistoric occupation at the Blue Hole site was
generally compressed into surficial strata (see Figures 9, 11, and 13), and no
major Late Prehistoric features or other meaningful cultural aggregations were
discovered; thus, there was no clear separation between them as at the La Jita
excavations (Hester 1971).
Perdiz (13 specimens). Perdiz points characteristically have barbed
shoulders and sharply pointed, contracting stems. They vary considerably in size
and shape and the specimen shown in Figure 14 has a broad stem and is
considerably larger than the others. Most of these specimens were broken and

but two of the specimens were 3 mm thick. WT: 0.5-3.2; L: 13-48; MW: 11-24;
SW: 5-10; MT: 1-4.
Scallorn (6 specimens). These are comer or side-notched points with
straight to slightly convex lateral edges and well-barbed shoulders. The expanding stem varies from a broad, wedge-shaped, convex base (U.I.s #486 and #357) to a narrower, concave base (U.I. #215). Three of the specimens were unifacial.
WT: 0.9-1.5; L: 21-30; MW: 14-16; SW: 8-15; MT: 2-3.
Edwards (27 specimens). The Edwards points are sharply pointed and have
straight lateral edges; some are serrated (see Figure 14: U.I. #147). The prominent shoulders are sharply pointed, and the stem is deeply divided and flares
outward. Most of the specimens exhibited fine workmanship, from the straight
triangular blades, deep comer notches, to the flaring stems. Their similarity to a
scaled down version of the Frio dart point, noted by Sollberger (1967) and Hester
(1971:67), supports the placement of this type as the earliest arrowpoints in the

Late Prehistoric period along with the apparent continued use of the Transitional
Archaic Frio and Ensor dart points. The most obvious modification in the
Edwards form is the drastic narrowing of the neck width, apparently an adaptation for hafting to the more diminutive arrow shafts. WT: 0.7-3.6; L: 18-42; MW:

Dart Points
Two hundred and two dart points were found and identified into the following typological categories, described in the order of their temporal progression
(see Table 2).
Ensor (12 specimens). These points are addressed at length in the following
Frio/Ensor Typology section of this paper. The measurement ranges are: WT:
3.2-14.0; L: 33-61; MW: 18-36; SW: 16-36; MT: 4-6.
Frio (47 specimens). These points are also addressed at length below. The
measurement ranges are: WT: 4.5-17.0; L: 32-66; MW: 20-47; SW: 20-40; MT:
3-7.
Marcos (18 specimens). These are broad, triangular points with deep corner
notches, expanding stems, and pointed to square barbs (Figure 15). The overall

ranges in size were: WT: 7.8-37.0; L: 44-82; MW: 32-57; SW: 16-30; MT: 5-11.
However, the Marcos type had the most uniform morphological characteristics of
any point category, with all but a few falling within the following ranges: WT:
12-14; L: 60-66; MW: 36-40; SW: 23-27; MT: 6-7.
Castroville (8 specimens). They have extremely symmetrical, triangular
bodies with long, basal-notched barbs, straight stems, and straight lateral edges.
All of the specimens were characterized by extraordinarily fine workmanship
and are exceptionally thin for their relative size. The Castroville points are
sometimes associated with bison kills (Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Collins 1968).
The overall ranges were: WT: 15.0-34.5; L: 66-116; MW: 42-52; SW: 21-28:
MT: 5-8. The three Castroville points found in association with an apparently
deliberate cache in Feature 7 are described below.

30

Montell (38 specimens). The Montell’s from Blue Hole are triangular

points with relatively short stems with V- or U-shaped basal notches. They have
straight lateral edges and the strong shoulders are usually barbed, at least prior
to reworking. Most of the Montell points conformed to a standard pattern and

had finer workmanship than their temporal predecessor, the Pedernales. Almost
all of the specimens were 6 mm thick, although two were 3 and 10 mm thick.
Much like the Pedernales, some specimens exhibited a great deal of reworking
(see Figure 15). WT: 8.0-28.0; L: 42-86; MW: 28-50; SW: 18-30; MT: 3-10.
Marshall (11 specimens). These broad triangular points have strongly convex to rounded lateral edges, and strong shoulders that are deeply barbed (Figure
16). The relatively short, expanding stems have slightly concave bases. Flute-like
flakes were removed in stem thinning. WT: 8.8-26.0; L: 44-73; MW: 33-49; SW:
17-30; MT: 5-9.
Pedernales (52 specimens). These long points are characterized by a
bifurcated stem with a deep basal concavity. This was the predominant point
type at the Blue Hole site and was almost invariably found with the deeper and
earliest concentrations of burned rock. They exhibited considerable variation
from the broader, initial Pedernales product (U.I. #441 in Figure 17) to the
narrower, or shorter, later stages of reworked Pedernales. Some of the specimens
have strong barbs while others have almost rounded shoulders. The stem remains
rather uniform throughout the type. Although none were found at the Blue Hole
site, several reworked Pedernales drills or perforators were found at the Smith
site (Smith 1990). WT: 5.7-36.0; L: 41-85; MW: 29-51; SW: 15-27; MT: 5-9.
Kinney (7 specimens). This elongated point has convex edges with a slightly
to deeply concave base (see Figure 16). The basal corners vary from sharply
pointed (U.I. #348) to rounded (U.I. #318). WT: 9.5-32.0; L: 57-90; MW: 26-34;
SW: 23-27; MT: 6-9.
Langtry (1 specimen). This specimen is thin and has straight lateral edges
and strong shoulders with a pointed stem (see Figure 16). It has been reworked
and the stem varies from the Langtry’s generally straight to concave base. WT:
10.4; L: 60; MW: 44; SW: 16; MT: 6.
La Jita (1 specimen). The La Jita point has an expanded stem with a
slightly concave base; both the corners of the stem and the shoulders have been
rounded (Figure 18). WT: 11.9; L: 56; MW: 32; SW: 26; MT: 7.
Nolan (2 specimens). These points have long lateral edges that are straight
to convex, with tapered shoulders. One specimen has the steep, alternate beveling
on the stem edges which is characteristic of this type. Respective quantitative
measurements are: WT: 12.5 & 11.2; L: 65 & 63; MW: 25 & 24; SW: 20 & 15;
MT: 7 & 7.
Martindale (1 specimen). With prominent shoulders and short barbs
formed by corner-notching, this point’s most distinguishing feature is its concave "fishtail" base (see Figure 18). WT: 7.8; L: 44; MW: 32; SW: 23; MT: 7.
Uvalde (2 specimens). The two specimens have triangular bodies with
prominent shoulders or barbs. The stems vary from slightly expanding (U.I.
#177) to flaring (U.I. #293), with concave bases (see Figure 18). Measurements
are: WT: 3.9 & 10.4; L: 31 & 51; MW: 25 & 31; SW: 16 & 20; MT: 5 & 6.
Early Triangular (2 specimens). These triangular points have careful
parallel-oblique flaking with straight to slightly concave bases and straight to

convex, alternately-beveled lateral edges (see Figure 18). The measurements of
#73 are: WT: 5.2; L: 36; MW: 35; SW: 35; MT: 5. The specimen from one of the
geomorphological test units was not measured.

Plainview (1 specimen). This specimen has a fragmented base but exhibited
the parallel flaking and basal grinding characteristic of this Paleoindian type (see
Figure 18). It was recovered out of context in the Late Prehistoric zones of the
excavation. WT: 9.5; L: 62; MW: 17; SW: 17; MT: 7.

Frio/Ensor Typology
A major problem with South Central Texas projectile point chronologies
is the broad temporal distribution of the Frio type points. Turner and Hester
(1985:100) describe the Frio point’s modal attributes as "a triangular body, often short and broad, with wide side or corner notches and a concaval basal indentation that ranges from shallow to a deep U-shaped notch" and place it in
the "Transitional Archaic, ca. 200 B.C.-A.D. 600 (or later)." Similarly, they
define the Ensor points as:
varying considerably in all dimensions, but broad stems, shallow side
notches and generally straight bases tend to identify the type. Specimens with a U-shaped basal notch are sometimes called Ensor-Frio.
Typology is frequently difficult because there appears to be much
gradation of basal forms from Frio to Ensor (Turner and Hester
(1985:94).
Again, it is placed in the Transitional Archaic period.
The excavation at Blue Hole, however, produced points with these general
stylistic characteristics at levels clearly attributable to periods ranging from the
Late Prehistoric through the Middle Archaic. Thus, the value of these types as
historical time markers requires refinement and redefinition of generally accepted lithic typologies when new excavations or different analytical methods
enable such refinements. Redefining the temporal or geographic focus of a projectile point type must be evaluated on a progressive basis. Because of the broad
temporal range of the Frio and Ensor types at the Blue Hole Site, further analyses were performed to determine if discrete groups of Frio and Ensor points
could be defined that have specific temporal implications.

Stylistic Analysis

The 59 Frio/Ensor points recovered were segregated into four stylistic categories, based on their basal configuration (Figures 19-22) as follows:
Group I (4 specimens): A broad triangular point with moderate concave
edges, a concave base, and long barbs formed by corner-notching.
Group 2 (12 specimens): Generally as tong as wide, this traditional "Ensor"
form evidences broad stems, shallow side notches, and generally straight
bases.

Frio type.
In establishing the chronology of the Blue Hole site earlier, the Transitional
Archaic was not segregated into distinct strata since no clear delineation could
be made. Rather, all of the Frio and Ensor types, which are the main time marker

Castroville points. The Group 1 point in the Wll0 trench was also
found in Level 6, consistent with the Marcos/Castroville strata (see
Figures 24-25).

2)

Group 2 occurs in the Transitional Archaic deposits. This Ensor type may
be the successor to Group 3, which appears in earlier deposits at the Blue
Hole site.

3)

Groups 3 and 4 have a much broader temporal distribution than Groups 1
and 2. Group 3 is probably a Late Archaic diagnostic, but Group 4, the
commonly accepted Frio type, appears to co-occur with Pedernales points
at the Blue Hole site in the Middle Archaic deposits. Group 4 forms
continue through the Transitional Archaic in numbers too substantial, and
with a distribution too consistent, to attribute it to prehistoric "collecting"
or "reuse."

Quantitative Analysis
As an alternative method to the stylistic groupings, the 59 Frio/Ensor points
were also weighed (grams) and then measured (ram) along several parameters,
such as length, width, thickness, stem length, stem width, stem thickness, and
neck width (data on file at TARL). Measurements of the artifacts were estimated
if the specimens were incomplete. Measurement ranges were then compared by
group: Group 1 tended to be very large and heavy and Group 3 tended to be
smaller and lighter in size. No correlations were derived from these measurements. The quantitative data base was then computer processed to search for
correlations to support or negate the stylistic grouping, or to possibly suggest
alternate groupings.
Pearson’s R (Product-Moment correlation) on all 59 specimens revealed
no strong correlations that were not previously evident in the data. The anticipated high positive correlations between such measurements as maximum thickness and weight, stem width and neck width, or length and weight, were
confirmed for the entire class, but no less obvious correlations were revealed.
Similar analyses were then performed for each stylistic group, 1 through 4, with
specific results of the one-to-one measurement correlations as follows:
Group 1: Generally very high correlations, all of which were positive,
except for neck width.
Group 2: Very high correlations to all variables. As a type, this
traditional Ensor evidences the most consistent similarities and
correlations.

38

Texas Archeological Society
Group 3: Wide variation due to fluctuations in size, length, and width.
All correlations remained positive except for stem width.
Group 4: Wide variation similar to Group 3, due to size variation. But
again, the stem width, length, and thickness scored high correlations
and were very consistent; all correlations were positive.
The data were then subjected to multivariant discriminant analyses, which

evaluates the characteristics of each group and places a quantitative correlation
coefficient for the similarity of each individual artifact to the overall attributes of
the groups. As with Pearson’s R, the assignment of consistent values to each of
the variables, where weight, length, and width tend to vary considerably within

meaningful correlations are derived. Yet the statistical analyses yielded the

larger than usual stem length and width in proportion to the rest of the
projectile point.

While very strong correlations within the groups were not anticipated due
to variation in the size and weight of points within the Frio/Ensor groups, the
overall results were generally supportive of the stylistic form classification.
Although the size and weight differentials were anticipated to skew the results
somewhat, they were nevertheless included in the attribute analyses. Purposeful
exclusion of unfavorable data would merely have resulted in "forcing" the
correlations.

Relative Geographical Studies
The recognition of stylistic and temporal variation in the Frio~nsor types
is nothing new. Suhm and Jelks (1962) identified four stylistic variations, calling
them Edgewood, Ensor, Fairland and Frio, dating them from as early as 3000
B.C. to A.D. 1000. Turner and Hester (1985) continue to recognize all four
points as distinct types (partially due to their varied geographical distribution),
but place them uniformly in the Transitional Archaic (200 B.C.-A.D. 600) or
later.

44

Texas Archeological Society

Hester (1971) divided 28 specimens from the La Jita site into Edgewood,
Ensor, and Frio types with six sub-varieties. Highley et al. (1978) split 19 Ensor
types into six sub-varieties from the Scorpion Cave excavations. At Panther
Springs Creek, Black and McGraw (1985) recovered 77 specimens identified as
Edgewood, Ensor, Fairland, and Frio, along with several more unnamed classes
of "side- and corner-notched triangular," and placed all of them in the Transitional Archaic period occupation of the site.
Lukowski (1987:217-220) identified 36 projectile points from four Uvalde
County sites in the Leona River Watershed as Edgewood, Ensor (two varieties),
Fairland, and Frio, and placed them chronologically in the Late through Transitional Archaic periods. Katz (1987:110-112) grouped the 39 Ellis, Ensor,
Fairland, and Frio points from 41BX300 into local period 9, A.D. 200-600.
Hall et al. (1986), in the Choke Canyon project, recognized several unnamed specimens of "large expanding stem," in addition to the 17 points placed
into the Ensor and Fairland types. Two of the points that Hall et al. (1986) called
the Ensor type came from deposits radiocarbon dated to 100 B.C. and A.D. 590,
quite consistent with the stratigraphic placement of Blue Hole Group 2 (traditional Ensor) in the Transitional Archaic (see Figures 23-25).
No other reports from the general area have as clear a stratigraphical record
as the Blue Hole site in chronologically placing a broad range of projectile
points. Heavy disturbance, consistent with caves, hampered dating of the Scorpion Cave archeological record and associated projectile points. Panther Springs
Creek deposits, in addition to being heavily disturbed, were vertically compressed, thus rendering the separation of temporal zones difficult. The Choke
Canyon sites were also generally compressed, and none of the single site excavations yielded the quantity and temporal diversity of diagnostic projectile points
that have been successfully used to establish the relative chronology at the Blue
Hole site.

Summary of the Frio/Ensor Analyses
These analyses have been presented to improve the definition of the Frio
and Ensor projectile point types. Though they are far from conclusive, the group
differentiation of temporal placement during the excavations, and the substantiation of modal similarities with the statistical studies, clearly warrant future
classificatory attention when planning and performing excavations and lithic
analysis in the South Central Texas area. The question of whether the variation
between defined Groups 1-4 should be categorized as types, varieties, or related
varieties, I will leave to the typologists who have spent years reviewing the
temporal and geographical variation of the broad range of projectile points to
understanding Texas prehistoric hunter-gatherers.

Henry E. Mueggenborg ~ Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

The goal and intent of this section has been merely to clarify the descriptive varieties of Frio/Ensor projectile points and their temporal significance. We
must insure that the temporal and spatial placement of projectile points are as
valid and up-to-date as possible. The purely descriptive analyses performed here,
along with continued excavation and analyses of new sites and data, should help
place the Frio and Ensor types more accurately in the South Central Texas chronological framework.

Other Stone Tools
"Semi-Unique" Items
The category of "semi-unique" items was designated for all non-diagnostic projectile points, bifacial fragments, and other worked stone from the Blue
Hole site. All of the "semi-unique" items were reviewed in the laboratory and
were grouped into the fol!owing categories: 1) Distal Projectile Point Fragments,
2) Proximal Projectile Point Fragments, 3) Other Bifacial Fragments, 4) Preforms, 5) Modified or Utilized Flakes, and 6) Cores.There were 469 semi-unique
specimens. They were then plotted onto the cross-sections of the units, similar
to the previous plots of the burned rock, and those of the diagnostic projectile
points (Figures 26-28).
The general concentration of the "semi-unique" items was then compared
in transparent overlays to the cross-sectional views of the burned rock and lithic
debitage (see the following). A very direct correlation was evident between the
"semi-unique" items and chert debitage. Conversely, burned rock concentrations
bore a very indirect relationship with the "semi-unique" items and the debitage.
This indirect relationship was even more pronounced than that between diagnostic projectile points and the burned rock. Again, lines A and B were drawn
onto the cross-sectional profiles that establish the relative stratigraphy of the site.

Distal Projectile Point Fragments
There were 79 distal fragments recovered. They were not further distinguished as to general size, thickness, or representative portion of the original
projectile point. The cross-sections indicate that most of the distal tips were
recovered from the deepest Late Prehistoric strata (which overlies the concentrated burned rock midden on the W110 line and the westernmost five units of
the N106 line). Only three distal tips were recovered from the Late Prehistoric
strata in the 17 units to the east of W105 on the N106 line, whereas 32 were
recovered from the 15 units proceeding westward to W110 and then south on
the W110 line.

Proximal Projectile Point Fragments
Eleven proximal fragments were recovered that could not be placed into a
specific typological classification. Since almost all of the 268 diagnostic projectile points were nearly complete, most broken proximal fragments were probably
discarded at a hunting location and were seldom carried back to the site, which
was possibly used as a food processing location.

Other Bifacial Fragments
There were 211 unclassified bifacial fragments, in varying stages of reduction, in the units. No obvious trends or concentrations were evident either within
certain horizontal areas or in deposits of specific chronological periods. Since the
Blue Hole site served at least partially as a food processing location, these
fragments may have been either broken and discarded cutting or scraping tools,
or by-products of lithic manufacture at the processing location.

Preforms
There were 67 preforms in various stages of reduction. Again, no obvious
concentrations were evident. As with other biracial fragments, most of these
specimens were probably discarded at varying stages in the manufacturing process (Figures 29 and 30).

Modified or Utilized Flakes
There were 79 flakes which evidenced utilization or wear. Their distribution
appears coincident to the heavier lithic scatters and to that of the diagnostic
projectile points. As with other bifacial fragments, they may have been utilized
as cutting or scraping tools. No in-depth microscopy or chemical analyses have
yet been performed on the flakes to further determine their function.

Cores
Only 22 cores were recovered in the excavations. None was particularly
large or diagnostic regarding manufacturing/reduction processes. The low number of cores indicates that the Blue Hole site probably served as a lithic finishing station: preliminary manufacture was being performed on the raw material
at or near a lithic quarry, and the quarry blanks were generally brought to the
site for further reduction.

Miscellaneous Other Tools (Figure 31)
Certain stone artifacts were found which, although not typologically diagnostic, were rather typical of certain stone implements described in Turner and
Hester (1985). They include:
Friday Biface (Turner and Hester 1985:214) from N105W110, level 2. This
unstemmed, relatively thin, bifacially thinned knife has an approximately
straight base that has been thinned by the removal of several broad, thin
flakes. Its occurrence in the Late Prehistoric strata is consistent with its
known temporal placement.
Probable side fragment of a Corner-Tang Biface from N103W110, level 7.
Although the specimen is incomplete, it appears to be the convex-edged,
lateral portion of the tool. This type of tool is common to South Central
Texas, and its placement in Late Archaic deposits at the Blue Hole site is
consistent with its assumed age (Turner and Hester 1985:210-211).
o Perforator/Drill from NI03Wll0, level 11. Characterized by a long and
tapered bit that is diamond-shaped in cross-section, this bifacially flaked

N105W95, level 9, and N106W109, level 9 (see Figure 31, bottom row).
Stratigraphically, this places all of the hammerstones in the Middle Archaic
period deposits at the site.

Chert Debitage
Overall Plot

The number of flakes per unit was computer plotted onto the cross-sections
of the units (Figures 32-34). As stated earlier, the plots bore a very direct
relationship to that of the "semi-unique" items and a very indirect, or inverse,
relationship to the burned rock. It is apparent, when comparing the burned rock
densities with the debitage concentrations, that the activities which created the
two artifact classes are basically mutually exclusive. It appears, returning to
Hester’s (1971) "rubble dump" concept, that during the Middle through Late
Archaic, the Blue Hole site inhabitants periodically cleared the cooking area of
all cracked rocks and other debris and deposited it on the slightly elevated mound
of refuse 8-10 m away. This would account for the relatively minimal deposition
of debitage and other lithic artifacts within the burned rock midden proper.

Detailed Debitage Analysis
Five 1 meter units were selected for more detailed analysis of the chert
debitage: N105W86, N105W95, N106W104, N106W110, and N94W110. The
purpose was to determine if the flake debris from varying areas of the excava-

tion units would indicate that different kinds of chert manufacturing/reduction
activities occurred across the site, and, in the same light, if temporal changes
could be noted.
The flakes were sorted, by 10 cm unit level, into the following categories:
1)

Primary cortex (596 flakes): resulting from the removal of the cortex from
the nodule. Generally 60-80 percent of the surface is covered with cortex.

2)

Secondary cortex (1990 flakes): the dorsal face retains some cortex but
also has one or more flake removals.

3)

Interior or tertiary flakes (1540 flakes): no cortex on either surface as they
have been removed from the interior of the core.

4)

Biface thinning or lipped flakes (920 flakes): the result of biface thinning
activities, these have an overlapping or lipped striking platform on a rather
diffuse bulb of percussion.

5)

Miscellaneous chips and fragments (14,185 flakes): any items which could
not be placed in categories 1-4.
The flakes (N=19,231) were counted and weighed (in total by category) for

each unit level. Of this number, only 5,046, or 26.3 percent were placed into
categories 1-4 above. While part of the reason for the high frequency of Category
5 debitage is possibly due to reasonably inexperienced lab personnel, these
results are not inconsistent with Hester’s (1971:109) analysis of the debitage at
La Jita: 32 percent of all flakes fell into into categories 1-4.
Further analysis of the debitage from these selected units, and all of the
excavation units, may provide greater insight into the temporal and areal character of the lithic industry at the site. It should be noted, however, that the use of 1/
4-inch screen during the excavations prevented the collection of possibly large
amounts of micro-debitage. However, column samples were taken from each of
the levels from the five selected units and these are also curated at TARL.

OTHER ARTIFACTS
A number of other interesting cultural items were found in the west end of
the N106 trench. They include:

a) A marine gastropod shell bead found in association with the Castroville
cache in N106W110, level 6 (Figure 35a). The shell has a perforation,
apparently man-made, through the outer whorl near the aperture, presumably to facilitate stringing. It is identified as a Prunuum (leptegouana)
apicina, and it originates on the Texas Gulf coast. Six similar beads were
recovered from the Choke Canyon excavations (Highley 1986:75) in Archaic occupational zones. The Castroville cache at the Blue Hole site is
within the Late Archaic deposits.

Henry E. Mueggenborg ~ Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

b)

55

A small polished stone bead was found in N106W110, level 4 (Figure
35b). It was obviously a jewelry item, either in a simple necklace or as a
bead in a more ornate arrangement. Highly polished, the bead had been
drilled from both sides, and lateral grooves had further been filed into it.
The bead was recovered from Late Prehistoric deposits.

c)

A worked and cut bone bead came from N106W104, level 9 (Figure 35c).
The tubular bead had a dull polish, probably from wear, and had been
manufactured by the groove and snap technique. The species of animal for
the bone was not identified. The specimen was recovered from the lowest
Late Archaic strata.

d)

A cut and decorated bone artifact fragment, probably of bison rib, with a
symmetrical configuration of small, shallow pits drilled into it, was found
in N106W101, level 4 (Figure 35d). Miller and Jelks (1952:185) reported
two similar bone objects, although they were larger and with less
decoration, associated with burials near the Belton Reservoir in Coryell
County. Suhm (1957:49) recovered another somewhat similar and, again,
much larger, bone object at the Smith Rockshelter in Travis County. None
of these evidenced the intentional, symmetrical drilling as in this specimen.
These three artifacts were attributed to Late Prehistoric period occupations,
whereas the Blue Hole specimen was recovered from the most recent Late
Archaic strata. The items may have some ritualistic significance, or may

have been used as gaming pieces, but no conclusive interpretations are
offered as to their function.

e) A broken stone pendant was recovered from N106W110, level 3, in Late
Prehistoric strata. The unpolished flat stone appeared to have been ground
on the sides and was biconically drilled in two places (Figure 35e).

FAUNAL AND MOLLUSCAN REMAINS
No significant vertebrate skeletal remains were recovered. Some occasional
bison and deer bone were found in the Late Prehistoric deposits, especially in the
upper three levels at the west end of the N106 trench. A large bison tooth was
found in general association with the Castroville cache discussed below. No bone
accumulations or spatial concentrations were identified which lent meaningful
associations with features or artifacts recovered from the Blue Hole site.
Land snails were recovered, generally in high concentrations, throughout
the Blue Hole excavations. The uppermost level or two of each unit generally
produced very few snail shells whereas many unit levels contained nearly 1,000
of the shells (level 5 of N105W89 produced 1,100 Rabdotus shells; Figure 36).
In all, 100,000 to 150,000 Rabdotus were recovered from the units. Rabdotus
were the predominant land snails recovered in TAS excavations (over 95 percent

of total snail count), but use of the 1/4-inch screen suggests that the other smaller
species (Helicina, Rumina decollata, Polygyra, and Helisoma) may have been
overlooked. While the laboratory records reflect the counts of each species by
unit level, only those of the Rabdotus were plotted on the cross-sections (Figures
36-38).
Due to the heavy concentrations of land snails in the matrix of most BRMs,
it has been proposed that prehistoric hunter-gatherers collected and utilized these
snails as a dietary supplement. Hall et al. (1982:470) support this hypothesis
based on the very high protein count of the Rabdotus. Ethnohistoric accounts
(Campbell and Campbell 1981:17) corroborate the consumption of land snails in
the summer months by South Texas groups. Highley (1986:87-88) recounts that
Rabdotus occur in concentrated colonies of up to an acre in size and that these
nocturnal foragers seek cover from the daylight heat under rocks and logs, or by
affixing themselves to plant stems.
The dietary supplement hypothesis is certainly supported by their ready
availability, their high protein, and the ethnohistorical record. It would have been
a relatively simple task to collect them and process them at an area where other
types of food processing was already taking place. It is also possible that some of
the land snails were simply drawn to the sites because of the rich floral and
faunal debris, and the subsequent anthropogenic soil development, associated
with a cooking site. While any long term experiment to evaluate the natural
accumulation of land snails relative to cooking debris could never duplicate the
span of 3,000 years or so that these sites accumulated, it would be interesting to
test a plot over several seasons to determine the residual accumulation of the
snail shells.
Regardless of the reason for the Rabdotus presence, the trench overlays
show that the heavier concentrations of snails generally overlie the dense burned
rock concentrations and are not coincident to them (see Figures 8, 10, and 12
and Figures 36-38). While the Rabdotus’ relationship to the burned rock is not
as strongly inverse as that of the debitage to the burned rock, there is no positive relationship. Thus, it would have been the case that the Rabdotus were not
an integral part of the cooking process that created the burned rock concentrations. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of the Rabdotus in the BRM and nonmidden deposits, both vertically and horizontally, seems to indicate the natural
introduction of the snails to the occupation deposits.
In my opinion, an inordinate amount of time was spent in the laboratory
counting the snails from the unit levels. Since the Rabdotus recovered from the
Blue Hole site were rather uniform in size, the same meaningful comparisons
could have been obtained by volumetrically measuring (e.g., 1 cup = 100
Rabdotus) the snails at the site and discarding them. Occasional tests to determine the accuracy of the estimates would insure that the data recorded remained
within the 90-95 percent range of accuracy. A unit or two could then be selected
for later, in-depth analysis.

FEATURES
Descriptions
Seven features, five hearths, a cache of Castroville dart points, and an
unidentified "pavement lens," were identified in the Blue Hole excavations. It
is possible that in situ hearths may have been unrecognized in the areas and
levels of extremely dense burned rock, but the matrix and excavation methods
in the other areas were such that any atypical rock concentrations should have
been noted. The seven recorded features, briefly described below, are not
plotted to the cross-views of the units, but reference to the burned rock and
projectile point plots in Figures 8-13 will place the features within the established stratigraphy.

Feature 1, N98W110, levels 2-3.
This configuration of limestone rocks was about 50 cm in diameter and
consisted mainly of larger rocks 8-15 cm in diameter. The matrix within 1 or 2
cm of the hearth was a slightly lighter, greyish soil and was harder than the
general matrix of the unit, indicating probable heat alteration. There were no
large pieces of charcoal in association with the hearth, but matrix samples were
taken (not analyzed) for flotation and pollen analysis. An Edwards and a
Pedernales point were found in the level above the hearth but were not in
association with it. Stratigraphically, the hearth appears at the top of the dense
burned rock concentration and, based on the cultural stratigraphy, can be placed
at the top of the Late Archaic deposits.

Feature 2, NIO1W110, levels 10-11.
Only the westernmost part of this hearth was exposed, with the main body
of the hearth apparently lying in unit N101W109 (unexcavated) to the east. It
consisted of six large rocks 8-15 cm in diameter, and about 15 smaller rocks, and
it was about 75 cm wide. No charcoal was present, and the matrix around the
hearth was not different from that above or below the hearth. No special samples
were taken. A Pedernales point was recovered from level 11, but was not in
direct association with the hearth. This hearth occurs in the Middle Archaic
deposits, part of the earliest occupations which contributed to the BRM.

Feature 3, N98W110, level 10.
Feature 3 was a dense "pavement lens" separating the black matrix of the
BRM and the underlying lighter Q2 deposits. There was no charcoal associated
with the feature. It consisted of several, unusually large, flat rocks, the two

60

Texas Archeological Society

largest of which measured 25 x 22 x 10 cm and 29 x 32 x 4 cm, respectively. The
intervals between the 15 or so larger flat rocks were almost completely filled in
with smaller rocks 5-10 cm across. The yellow color of the Q2 alluvium was
evident upon removal of this "pavement lens."
A Frio and a Kinney point were found directly on the upper surface of this
tens. Samples were taken for flotation and pollen, but have not yet been analyzed. This feature dates to the Middle Archaic.
Unit N98W110 was selected for continued excavations over Labor Day, and
it was taken 80 cm deeper. While the matrix continued to lighten through level
12, it then became gradually darker through level 15, when it resumed the natural
lightening in color with depth. This suggests that an alluvial episode in the
Middle Archaic interrupted the occupation of the site at about level 12. Occupation subsequent to the alluvial deposits then created the lens in Feature 3, as
seasonal activities resumed at the site.

Feature 4, N106W110, level 4
This was a shallow, bowl-shaped hearth, consisting of 17-18 medium-sized
rocks (5 x 10 cm) and four or five larger, flatter rocks (Figure 39). The central
part of the hearth contained no rocks for about 15 cm across. Overall, the hearth
would have been about 75-80 cm in diameter. The matrix at this level was a
loose, sandy loam without baked or hardened clay. Some small associated char-

coal pieces were retrieved as samples, and soil samples were taken from the
matrix immediately beneath the hearth. No diagnostic artifacts were found in
association with this feature. The hearth is within the Late Prehistoric strata and
is 20 cm above the Castroville cache (Feature 7).

Feature 5, N106W108, level 9.

This feature was a dark gray, circular anomaly, in the otherwise yellowish
brown Q2. Measuring about 35 cm in diameter, it was associated with small bits
of unburned bone and burned clay. Special samples were taken but have not been
analyzed. There were no rocks around the perimeter, but there was a concentration (10 kg) of burned rock to the east of the feature. In the same level, two
Pedernales points were recovered at approximately the same depth. This hearth
falls within the Middle Archaic strata, but is below the main BRM.

Feature 6, N94W110, level 13
Perhaps the most distinctive hearth unearthed during our excavations, this
slab-lined, basin-shaped burned limestone hearth was in the north half of the unit
and extended into N95W110 (Figure 40). Based on the thermal fracturing of the
stones, it appeared that the larger perimeter rocks had experienced horizontal

displacement of less than 0.25 cm. Furthermore, there were piles of smaller, fistsized, severely fractured rocks placed in two adjacent areas to the south of the
hearth; these appeared to have been removed from the hearth and purposefully
placed near it. The smaller groupings of rocks probably formed a cap over the
hearth during the cooking process, and, severely heat fractured, were removed at
completion. Two Pedernales points were found in direct association with the
hearth, and several nodules of charcoal, one piece approximately 2 cm across,
were retrieved.
Part of the larger piece of charcoal was submitted for radiocarbon assay at
The University of Texas Radiocarbon Laboratory and an absolute date of 3840 +
70 B.P. (TX-7057) was obtained. The calibrated date ranges (Stuiver and Reimer
1986) for the sample are 2468-2146 B.C. (4416-4096 B.P.). This is quite consistent with the stratigraphy, and the feature is attributed to the Middle Archaic. The
date range obtained also supports the chronological placement of the Pedernales
projectile point type at Blue Hole.

Feature 7, N106W110, level 6.
Two levels below the Late Prehistoric hearth (Feature 4), a Castroville point
(U.I. #434) was discovered in situ in the southeastern quadrant of the unit. After
it was removed and excavation continued, a rock concentration (Figure 41) was
identified immediately below it, which contained two more Castroville points

(U,I.s #437 and #439), a large preform (U.I. #444), and a marine shell. All of
these specimens are shown in Figure 42. A large bison tooth was recovered in
general association with the cache. To speculate on the significance of this
accumulation of artifacts, it is quite certain that they were placed in that
particular association by Late Archaic peoples; the cache may also have had
ritual significance. All of the points evidenced extremely fine workmanship and
may well have been manufactured by the same individual.

Archeomagnetic Sampling
The hearth identified as Feature 6 at N94W110, in addition to yielding the
charcoal samples for the radiocarbon assay discussed previously, was also subjected to archeomagnetic testing. The hearth features at the Smith Site, also
being excavated as a part of the TAS Field School, were a major focus of study,
and highly specialized coring equipment was used to retrieve and record samples
for laboratory testing. On the last day of the Labor Day excavations, a crew
brought the equipment to the Blue Hole site and retrieved eight cores from the
hearth limestone cobbles. The cores, approximately 2.5 cm in diameter, were
removed from selected in situ hearth stones and recorded so that their exact
physical orientation could be reconstructed in the laboratory.
While the location of magnetic north is near, over time, the location of
rotation north, secular variation takes magnetic north on excursions with variations up to 20 percent. Paleomagnetism is the study and reconstruction of the
history of the earth’s magnetic field. Simply put, whenever a rock is heated to
a certain point, it acquires a very stable permanent magnetism pointing in the
direction of magnetic north at the time the rock was so heated. Likewise, the
strength of the magnetism is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.
This remnent magnetism is referred to as thermo-remnent magnetism (TRM).
All rocks which cool from high temperatures acquire a TRM and, provided this
remnent magnetism is not subsequently altered, they will carry the memory of
the magnetic field which caused the remnent magnetism (Strangway 1970).
The elements of the magnetic field which can be measured at any given
location are declination, the direction of magnetic north; inclination, the angle
of dip below the horizon; and intensity, total field strength. Archeomagnetism
applies these premises of paleomagnetism to the past few thousand years in tracing the secular variations in the magnetic field. The application in archeology is
twofold: first, in identifying the in situ status of hearths or kilns, and second, as
an eventual alternative absolute dating method.
By reconstructing the orientation of the hearth stones in the laboratory, the
declination, inclination, and intensity of each core can be extracted. If all cores
exhibit nearly identical plots of the natural remnent magnetization (NRM), it is
relatively certain that they were in fact heated simultaneously in either a single
heating or cooking episode. Further testing involves thermally demagnetizing

the samples by heating them in 50° C increments (in a controlled non-magnetic
environment) until the samples reach a higher component of magnetization. At
this higher temperature, a sample then assumes the magnetic properties of its
orientation at some point in time prior to its alteration in the heating episode, or
simply "reverts back" to what the NRM would have been if the sample had not
been thermally altered. This further enables the researcher to define the temperature reached in the stones during the cooking episode.

By associating absolute dates, using radiocarbon dating or other methods,
with a series of plots of NRMs for any given general geographic area, an
archeomagnetic path can be established. This route can then be used to plot and
date any future archeomagnetic sample, just as dendrochronology sequences are
now used. While an area curve for the Edwards Plateau area has not yet been
established, each of the samples that are dated will hopefully lead to an area
curve that will enable the accurate dating of future archeomagnetic samples from
the area.
The specific data obtained from the archeomagnetic samples from Feature
6 are provided in Table 3, and the plot of the NRMs is shown in Figure 43. The
samples from Feature 6 were further demagnetized in 50° C increments to 450°
C (The laboratory records are on file at the Paleomagnetic Laboratory of the
Department of Geological Sciences at The University of Texas at Austin). Similar archeomagnetic analyses have been performed on hearthstones from the
Camp Pearl Wheat site in Kerr County, Texas (Collins et al. 1990:69-78). The
results from the tests at the Smith site (41UV132) are reported in Smith (1990).
Since the laboratory records were not available for review, it is impossible
to collate the sample numbers assigned in the laboratory to the assignation of the
hearth stones. But it is most apparent from the plot of the NRMs that six of the
samples are in fact part of an in situ hearth with only very minimal subsequent
settling or alteration.

SUMMARY
The Blue Hole site (41UV159) is a prehistoric site occupied by the ancient
peoples of the Sabinal Valley over several thousand years. While the bulk of the
cultural deposits at the site occurred in the Archaic, the Late Prehistoric is also
represented along with one Late Paleoindian period artifact. The site is located
on an alluvial terrace on the east bank of the Sabinal River, about 13 km south of
Utopia, Texas, in Uvalde County. It was first recorded by the UT 1989 Summer
Archaeological Field School survey crews, and was selected for excavation as a
major part of the TAS 1990 Summer Field School.
The environment and resources near the Blue Hole site were major factors
in the selection of the site by prehistoric peoples. The occupations took place on
an elevated terrace within 100 m of the "Blue Hole," which was probably a deep,
year-long source of water. The stream beds provided an unlimited source of
stream-rolled limestone cobbles which were utilized in cooking tasks at the site.
The site’s location at the southern edge of the Balcones Escarpment placed the
varied resources and habitats of both the Edwards Plateau and the South Texas
Plains within reach of mobile prehistoric hunter-gatherers.
A major portion of the Blue Hole site consists of a burned rock midden, a
Central Texas phenomenon which is usually a large accumulation of fire-cracked
and discolored limestone. Though the specific origin of the burned rock midden

Henry E. Mueggenborg -- Excavations at the Blue Hole Site

67

continues to be debated among archeologists (Hester 1991), it appears that
groups congregated repeatedly at favored locations to engage in a cooking process
that used limestone which was then abandoned or discarded. Lithic artifacts are
common in and adjacent to these burned rock middens. UT survey crews learned
that the Blue Hole site had long been a favorite of local projectile point collectors,
and we anticipated a high artifact recovery rate in the excavations.
The initial strategy at Blue Hole was to excavate 2 m units along intersecting lines from beyond the perimeter of the midden accumulation into the midden
proper, thus giving a broad view of the burned rock concentrations as well as
any adjacent occupation areas. We also excavated several test units in perimeter areas to provide visiting geomorphologists the opportunity to develop the
alluvial chronology of the terrace. After determining that some of the initially
selected units had previously been dug by an artifact collector, the excavation
plan was shifted to avoid the disturbed areas, and resulted in two intersecting 1
m wide excavations.
The geomorphological interpretation of the terrace deposits suggests that
the site terrace was an accumulation of alluvial episodes which occurred in the
Early to Middle Holocene (10,000-5000 B.P.). The cultural deposits then formed
upon this reasonably stable landscape surface. This temporal estimate enabled us
to anticipate identifying cultural strata from the Middle Archaic, or possibly
Early Archaic, period with little likelihood of identifying any Paleoindian occupation zones in the TAS excavations. Later cores taken to 3 m below the floors of
selected units in the main excavation area confirmed the nature of the major
Early to Middle Holocene alluvial deposits.
As the excavations proceeded vertically, it was apparent that the relative
chronology of the Blue Hole site conformed closely to that established for South
Central Texas. However, anthropogenic soil development had generally erased
any natural stratification within the alluvial deposits, which might otherwise
have separated occupational strata in the profiles. In order to define occupational
strata, the 268 diagnostic projectile points recovered in the excavations of the 1
m intersecting lines were plotted onto unit cross-sections. Similar cross-sections
of the units were plotted for: Burned rock weight; Lithic debitage; Rabdotus;
"Semi-unique" items; and Frio/Ensor points. The computer plots of the burned
rock weight, the number of debitage flakes, and Rabdotus shells enabled internal
comparison of each of these remains with each other to evaluate the site
stratigraphy.
Projectile points recovered from the uppermost deposits included four types
of Late Prehistoric arrowpoints: Perdiz; Sabinal; Scallorn; and Edwards. Fiftynine Frio and Ensor type points were recovered, which are generally attributed to
the Transitional Archaic. However, because these types were unevenly dispersed
in the deposits, no differentiation of the Transitional Archaic was made at Blue
Hole. Separate analyses of the morphological attributes of the Frio and Ensor
specimens suggest grounds for internal temporal differentiation. Late Archaic
points included 64 Marcos, Castroville, and Montell projectile points, with

68

Texas Archeological Society

Montell the predominant marker for the Late Archaic period. Pedernales (52
specimens) was the primary type marking the Middle Archaic, along with an
additional 19 Marshall, Kinney, and Langtry points. There were seven Early
Archaic points (La Jita, Nolan, Martindale, Uvalde, and Early Triangular types).
The only Paleoindian type recovered was a Plainview, found out of context in the
Late Prehistoric deposits.
Other stone tools recovered from Blue Hole include a Friday Biface, a
probable corner-tang biface fragment, a perforator, and three cylindrical
hammerstones, one of petrified wood and two of limestone. Five decorative or
ritualistic artifacts were obtained from various deposits at the site.
Rabdotus, the main land snail recovered in the excavations, was examined
to determine their relationship to the artifacts. While no conclusive relationships
were established to support or discredit their role as "dietary supplements," this
data should help formulate further research designs regarding snails.
The Blue Hole site excavations identified seven distinct features: five
hearths, an apparent cache of Castroville projectile points, and an unidentified
"pavement lens." Of these features, the hearth (Feature 6), found in the deepest
excavations near the perimeter of the burned rock midden proper, was radiocarbon dated to between 2468-2146 B.C. (calibrated). Two Middle Archaic
Pedernales projectile points were in association. Archeomagnetic sampling of
the feature stones showed that it was an in situ hearth complex. The Late Archaic
Castroville cache (Feature 7) included a marine shell ornament.
The excavations at the Blue Hole site recovered an enormous amount of
data relative to the Middle through Late and Transitional Archaic periods, and
this analysis and future studies of the information should provide further insights
on the burned rock midden phenomenon and the prehistoric settlement of the
Sabinal Valley area. The cross-sectional analyses of the burned rock, lithic
debitage, and land snail concentrations can be used for comparison with those
of previous excavations in burned rock middens in South Central Texas, and,
hopefully, as a guide to plan and analyze future excavations in the region.
A tremendous amount of hard work by TAS members during the 1990 Field
School excavations contributed the data analyzed in this paper. The 60 members who returned to the Blue Hole site over Labor Day weekend to continue
with the excavation objectives completed the area needed for this partial reconstruction of the site’s cultural history. Their dedication and personal commitment at the Blue Hole site has added yet one more chapter to the reconstruction
of the lifeways of the prehistoric inhabitants of the area.
A great number of prehistoric sites in the upper Sabinal Valley were documented and recorded by the surveys conducted as part of the 1990 TAS Field
School. This area of Texas obviously contains some of the richest material
records of these early inhabitants, particularly during the general period of 5000
B.C. to the birth of Christ. It is incumbent upon the professional and avocational
archeologists to continue the investigation and documentation of the archeological record within this valley. It is similarly essential that the residents and land-

owners of this lovely valley protect the valuable cultural resources which are
preserved there.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The excavations at the Blue Hole Site were made possible by the hard work
and dedication of the Texas Archeological Society, and my first "thank you"
goes to the approximately 150 members who braved the June heat of 1990 in
South Central Texas to excavate the site. Also, thanks to the 60 members who
returned over Labor Day, thus filling in many of the parts of the puzzle. The
organization and logistic preparation by the TAS Board of Directors and the
Field School Committee enabled the excavations to progress efficiently.
I would like to thank Dr. Thomas R. Hester for his direction as the
excavation’s Principal Investigator, both in terms of technical expertise and
moral support. Special thanks also to Dr. James A. Neely, who with Dr. Hester,
assisted me on my thesis committee, and to Dr. Samuel M. Wilson, who assisted with the statistical analyses employed in the Frio/Ensor typology.
The property owner, Mary K. Kindred, was most gracious and cooperative, not only in granting us exclusive access to the site, but in tolerating our
dusty daily arrivals and departures. I sincerely hope this report enhances her
interest, along with that of sons Danny, Donny, and Douglas, in the archeology
and prehistory of their beautiful ranch.
The strongest and most consistent effort in the completion of this report was
made by TAS member Bob Vernon, who programmed and provided the computer reconstructions of the cultural deposition of the site, around which this
paper is focused. Besides his time and expense in working with me, his feedback
prior to the Labor Day session, and after the completion of the excavations, was
greatly appreciated.

Burial to Bronze: Excavation, Analysis,
and Facial Reconstruction of a Burial
From the Wilson-Leonard Site, Texas

Elisa Phelps, Joan Few, Betty Pat. Gatliff
D. Gentry Steele, and Frank A. Weir

ABSTRACT
In 1983, the skeleton of a female human was found beneath Late Prehistoric,
Archaic, and Late Paleoindian cultural components during excavation at the
Wilson-Leonard Site (41WM235) on Brushy Creek north of Austin, Texas.
One of the six most complete Paleoindian skeletons recovered in North
America, the analysis revealed information about the biological nature and
health of this early North American inhabitant. The skull was complete but
crushed. Skull measurements and casts of skull fragments were used to rebuild
the skull to a form as anatomically correct as possible for this individual. The
rebuilt skull was used to sculpt the face in clay using tissue depths of bony
landmarks. The end product, a collaboration between an anthropologist and a
sculptor, is not an imaginative artistic work but reflects some of the individual
anatomical features of this particular skull based on the underlying cranial
architecture. The process of facial reconstruction was viewed by the public as
part of a Houston Museum of Natural Science educational program on the
biological evidence of the first Americans. A bronze was cast from the clay
sculpture and is on display at the Houston Museum of Natural Science.

INTRODUCTION
Our interest in the human remains from the Wilson-Leonard site
(41WM235) can be directly traced to an interest in the origins of our species,
Homo sapiens, and its dispersal throughout the world. Current knowledge suggests that modern humans arose sometime between 500,000 and 200,000 years
ago. We are uncertain whether our species first appeared in a specific locality
(some say Africa, some say the Middle East) and recolonized the Old world, thus
displacing the older species Homo erectus, or whether our species gradually
arose from Homo erectus throughout Africa and Eurasia.
However we began, the last contingents to be colonized by humans were
Australia and the Americas. Since these continents have been the most recently
colonized, we are hoping our understanding of these peoples and their migraBulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 62 (1994for 1991)

76

tion events will help us to understand better the earlier processes which led to
the establishment of modern humankind and our dispersal throughout the world.
The Wilson-Leonard site is particularly important in our quest for an understanding of the origins of the first Americans and the origins of all humankind because of the site’s antiquity and the antiquity and completeness of the burial
remains.

THE WILSON-LEONARD SITE
In 1983, the Texas State Department of Highways was excavating the
Wilson-Leonard Site on Brushy Creek, approximately 30 km north of Austin,
Texas, when the skeleton of a human female was found three m below the
present ground surface and beneath excellent Late Prehistoric, Archaic, and Late
Paleoindian cultural components; these cultural time periods span the last 12,000
years (Weir 1985). The burial pit was apparent in plan and section and the original depth of the grave was approximately 30 cm. Interred with her was a fossil
shark’s tooth found at the proximal end of the left humerus, a granitic sandstone chopper with pigment stains, and an angular fossiliferous limestone cobble
under which were found several particles of charcoal. This charcoal was submitted to the University of Arizona for dating through their tandem accelerator.
Reduced to only one mg of fine charcoal, a date (AA-171) of 13,000 + 3,000
years before present (B.P.) was produced. Two other assays using standard radiocarbon dating methods and yielding smaller deviations were derived from
the soil humates within the burial pit and are probably more accurate dates for
the burial. These are 9,470 + 170 (Tx-4787) and 9,650 + 120 (Tx-4793) years
B.P. Soil humate dates can be equal to, but are generally younger than, the actual time of deposition. The human bone was dated by the AMS technique, and
yielded radiocarbon ages of between 1270 to 6700 B.P. (Stafford et al. 1987).
These determinations can be accepted as minimum estimates only (Collins et
al. 1993).
In 1992-1993, excavations at the Wilson-Leonard site were conducted by
the staff of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of
Texas at Austin. The purpose was to obtain geological, radiocarbon, stable isotope, archeomagnetic, phytolith, diatom, and organic residue samples. These
new samples are undergoing analysis (Collins et al. 1993).
The stratigraphy at the site clearly documents the provenance and antiquity of the interment pit. The two soil zones immediately above the burial strata
contained traditional Paleoindian dart point forms including Midland, Plainview,
Scottsbluff, and Angostura. Seven specimens of a thick and notched dart point
form ("Wilson" points), and three lanceolate type specimens were found in the
soil strata associated with the burial. Below the burial the oldest and most discrete evidence of human occupation of the site was found. This assemblage
contained one very thin lanceolate projectile point associated with at least one

butchered bison. At the time of interment the individual was placed in the burial
pit on her right side in a semiflexed position facing west.

LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE BURIAL
With an estimated time of death approximately 9,500 years ago, the WilsonLeonard burial represents one of the four oldest individuals recovered in Texas,
and one of no more than 25 individuals of comparable age recovered in North
America. When one considers the completeness of the remains, the WilsonLeonard specimen represents one of the six most complete Paleoindian skeletons
recovered from North America. It is on the basis of these few remains that we
evaluate the biological nature and health of the first human populations to
colonize the New World. Consequently, each of these individuals is of extreme
importance to our understanding of the peoples of the Americas.
While the study of the biological remains of these Paleoindians has just
begun, there are a few evaluations which can be made at this time. The adult
female from the Wilson-Leonard site is represented by the major portion of the
skeleton. She was in her mid-20s to mid-30s at the time of death, and there is no
evidence for the cause of death. She was of modest height by today’s standards
with an estimated stature of 157.0 + 6.0 cm (62 + 2.5 inches), but her stature falls
near the female mean for Archaic and Late Prehistoric hunters and gatherers
from Central Texas. Her teeth were in remarkably good condition at the time of
death, exhibiting very slight wear on the molars and moderate wear on the
incisors. A much greater degree of wear is typically seen on burials of hunters
and gatherers of the Archaic and Late Prehistoric cultural periods within the
same geographic region. No cavities were apparent in the teeth, and only slight
calculus was present.
It would be particularly satisfying to have a clear perspective of this
individual’s biological affinities, but rarely can one individual reflect the nature
of the populations to which she or he belongs. The presence of shovel-shaped
lateral upper incisors is certainly indicative of this individual’s affinities with
Mongoloid populations of northern Asia and later North American Indian populations. The central upper incisors, on the other hand, are not as markedly
shoveled as is typical of most individuals in more recent northern Asian and
North American Indian populations. Similarly, the slight prognathism of her
upper palate is not the norm of later hunter and gatherer populations within the
region. Since both of these latter characteristics occur in more recent populations, but in a minority of individuals, we are left with an unanswered question.
Is the Wilson-Leonard individual representative of the norm of an earlier population which differs slightly from more recent hunters and gatherers, or does she
represent an individual reflecting the normal range of variation which we see in
more recent populations? In other words, were the first Americans a part of the
same human population as later North American Indians, or did these earlier

78

populations out of northern Asia represent a different population and a different
migration event? Only with careful comparative analyses of rare finds like the
Wilson-Leonard female will we ever be able to resolve these issues.

CASTING AND REBUILDING THE SKULL
The cranium of the Wilson-Leonard individual was crushed and fragile,
inhibiting handling and analysis (Figure 1). An acrylic medium was used to make
a cast of the skull which exactly reproduced the original shape as well as
reflected the damage to each side of the skull and the distortion and displacement
of the left side facial bones (Figure 2).
The original cast was preserved as a reference and a second cast was used
to rebuild the skull to reflect as close as possible the correct anatomical shape
of this particular individual. The second cast was altered by cutting it apart with
a dental burr, so that the pieces could be reassembled in their correct positions.
Working from the original cast, D. Gentry Steele estimated skull dimensions in
millimeters: Maximum cranial width, 125 mm; Maximum cranial length, 175
mm; Bizygomatic arch, 122 ram; Palate width, 56-60 mm; Nasion-gnathion, 115
mm; Gonion-gonion, 94-95 mm; and Nasospinale-gnathion, 66 mm.
Much of the cranium was sculpted in clay to these overall dimensions.
Casts of the temporal bones (including the external auditory meatus and mastoid process) were cut from the second cast and pressed into the clay cranium.
The casts of the grontal bone, right orbit, right zygomatic arch, and entire maxilla had little distortion and were readily positioned into the clay. The left side
of the facial bones was sculpted entirely of clay, using the opposite configuration and dimensions. The skull, rebuilt in clay incorporating the cast bone fragments and the rebuilt mandible, was ready for facial reconstruction (Figure 3).

FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION BACKGROUND
The facial reconstruction of the oldest known female American Indian from
Texas was sculpted by Betty Pat. Gatliff in January, 1990, at the Houston
Museum of Natural Science. The week-long process was viewed by the public as
part of an educational program on Texas prehistory that included the importance
of studying human biological remains.
The reliability of the facial reconstruction procedures developed and used
by Ms. Gatliff has been tested in modern forensic cases (Gatliff 1984; Gatliff
and Snow 1979). Unidentified remains, when facially reconstructed, have been
identified by families and friends who were able to produce photographs of the
deceased. Comparing clay reconstructions to photographs has supported the
ability of the techniques used to accurately reconstruct individual facial features.
Ms. Gatliff has sculpted 140 facial reconstructions on unidentified forensic

cases, resulting in 105 identifications. Identification in forensic cases is difficult because unidentified mortalities are frequently criminal victims, runaways,
and transients.
Skin depth measurements from 28 individuals were first used in facial
reconstruction by W. His (1895). In 1898, J. Kollman and W. Buchly added
additional measurements from 53 individuals. Skin depth measurements and
comparative studies by Krogman (1962), Rhine and Campbell (1980), and Rhine
and Moore (1982) have resulted in data useful on current forensic cases,

Phelps et al. ~ Burial to Bronze

particularly in America. It is helpful to have the tables divided by emaciated,
normal, and obese, as well as by sex and race.
Each individual skull dictates the location, size, and/or form of all of the
features: mouth, eyes, nose, and ears. The shape of the face is based on tissue
thickness. A physical anthropologist examines the skull to determine the
individual’s sex, race, and age. Depths of the soft tissues of the face are different in males and females of the three major racial groups. The individual’s age
at death, as well as individual anatomical peculiarities, diseases, and injuries,
influence the facial features of the person during life and must be considered
during reconstruction. For example, tissue depth and muscle tone change over
time, and to correctly reflect the individual must influence the reconstruction
processes.

FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION: PROCESS
The process of facial reconstruction follows a set pattern of procedures with
the individual skull measurements and determined tissue depths directing the
sculpting process. To begin the process, the rebuilt clay and cast skull was
mounted on a stand maintaining the Frankfort horizontal plane. Rubber cylinders were cut according to the appropriate tissue thickness for each of the 18
facial landmarks. Since there are no data for tissue thickness for prehistoric
populations, for this reconstruction, Gatliff used the tissue thickness charts compiled by Kollmann and Buchly (1898) because the diet and physical lifeways of
prehistoric Indians is closer to nineteenth century Europeans than to late twentieth century Americans (Figure 4). Tissue thickness includes in one measurement the size of the muscle, fatty tissue, and the skin thickness. The cut rubber
cylinder markers were glued directly onto the rebuilt skull (Figure 5). The markers were connected using modeling clay, sometimes called plasteline. The open
spaces were then filled in to form the shape of the face.
The mouth was formed by the shape of the front teeth. Three dimensions
were used in this process: (1) the depth, tissue marker #7 (see Figure 4), of the
upper lip margin; (2) the vertical thickness of the lips measured gumline to
gumline on the teeth; and (3) the width of the mouth, which is approximately
the distance between two lines radiating out from the junction of the canine and
first premolar on each side. Basically, the lips cover the front six teeth.
The mouth barrel was bent around the teeth, and the parting line of the lips
was creased horizontally along the halfway line and to each edge, to mark the
width (or corners) of the mouth. Chin and cheek areas were connected to the
mouth barrel. Lips were spread, rounded, and striated to give a life-like appearance and texture.
In facial reconstructions, the eye is a clay ball centered within the bony
orbit. The iris and pupil are carved out to give the eye expression. It is important
to construct the eyes to be anatomically correct, and thus the shaping of the eye

82

follows certain anatomical guidelines: (1) the apex of the cornea is approximately
tangent to a centrally located line drawn from the superior and inferior margins
of the orbit; (2) eyelids bend around the eyeballs, which give them the proper
three-dimensional quality; (3) the lower lid comes up to the bottom of the iris;
and (4) the pupil seems to hang from the upper lid.
There appears to be no relationship between the shape of the orbit and the
shape of an individual’s eyelids. A pleasant appearance can be given by closing
the lids just slightly and forming a little puff under the eye, just as a person
appears when starting to smile.
The human nose is based on two simple measurements: the width and the
projection. The width is computed by measuring the bony nasal aperture at its
widest points and increasing the dimension by 10 mm. The projection from subnasale to pro-nasale is three times the length of the nasal spine, which establishes
the tip of the nose. The tip of the nose can then be connected with the bridge

skull.

and built out to the width measurement. To complete the process of forming the
nose, the wings were rounded and the nares carved out to complete the nostrils.
The skull gives the location of the ear but no clues about their exact shape.
A rule of thumb is that the ear and nose are approximately the same length. Ears
are constructed in five steps:

84

Texas Archeological Society

1.

A "C" shaped bit of clay is formed to be the concha, and spreads at the top
for the antihelix.

2.

The helix is a long thin worm-like strip, rolled and pointed at one end.
Starting with the pointed end, it is curved around and fastened to the antihelix
and around the concha.

3.

The lobule is flattened and added to the lower portion of the ear, under the
concha.

4.

The ear is attached and the clay is smoothed into the side of the head. (To
position the ear, the external auditory meatus should be at the top of the
tragus. The ear is tipped back at about 15 degrees.)

5.

The tragus is constructed and attached, and then smoothed into the cheek to
complete the ear.

With the attachment of the ears, the facial sculpture was complete, as far
as using all of the information that the skull revealed (Figure 6). Hair style is
very difficult in prehistoric cases. It was decided for the Wilson-Leonard specimen to make the hair medium length, to fall below the earlobes on the sides.
The Wilson-Leonard clay sculpture was cast in bronze. It is on display at
the Houston Museum of Natural Science, a respectful alternative to the display
of human remains. From burial to bronze, this unnamed individual has had a
singular effect on the public. Museum visitors are amazed to find that the Wilson-Leonard female looks much like them. This visual connection to the past
humanizes our ancient ancestors and facilitates our understanding of the first
Americans.

Austin County, Texas

ABSTRACT
An assemblage of 82 artifact specimens collected from a site or sites along the
Brazos River in Austin County is described. Dart points and arrow points
present in the collection are diagnostic of the Late Paleoindian (Angostura) to
Late Prehistoric periods, with a full Archaic sequence represented as well. Also
present are conch shell pendants and two ground stone artifacts, a celt and an
adze. The celt and adze are made of stones likely originating in the Ouachita
Mountains of Arkansas. The presence of the shell ornaments and exotic ground
stone artifacts is consistent with findings previously made at certain Late Archaic cemeteries in the lower reaches of the Brazos and Colorado rivers.

INTRODUCTION

The specimens in the collection described here were picked up over a period of years by a resident of Austin County as they eroded out of cattle trails
cutting through a bluff face leading down to the floodplain of the Brazos River.
The locations of sites yielding the artifacts are not published at the request of
the property owner. The collection is now in the possession of individuals residing in Houston, Texas. Further details concerning the sites and collection are
on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas
at Austin.
The individual who collected these artifacts is now long-deceased. It was
therefore not possible to obtain his direct account of the circumstances under
which the finds were originally made. Members of the collector’s family were,
however, able to specify a short stretch of the Brazos River as the area where the
artifacts were found. Several prehistoric sites are officially recorded for this
general area and, in the absence of a thorough archeological survey, it is possible
that some additional unrecorded sites are present. Alhough it is the impression of
the relatives that the finds were all made on one site, it is more likely that the
assemblage is an amalgam from several sites present in the vicinity. This conclusion is based on observations made by the author and Mr. Joe Hudgins during
limited reconnaissance activities in the area.

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS

All of the specimens in this collection are made of stone or shell. Four
general descriptive categories are defined for the stone artifacts: Thick Bifaces,
Thin Bifaces, Uniface, and Ground Stone (Table 1). Among the lithics, 66 of
the 68 chipped stone specimens are made of chert. There is one piece of brown
petrified wood and one of jasper (brown to light brown "moss agate"). A celt
and an adze represent the ground stone category. The adze is made of a metamorphic slate or argillite and the celt is a very fine-grained igneous diorite.
The chert represented in the collection is generally of very good quality. It
is fine-grained and has few imperfections. The most common colors present are
light brown, tannish-cream, brown, and tannish-brown. Brown or white speckling is sometimes seen in these major color groups. Less common colors are
tannish-gray, mottled tan-brown-gray, and mottled and/or banded gray to dark
gray. Small numbers of the following make up the balance of the chert colors:
light gray, dark gray, pinkish-gray with gray stripes and spots, dark brown and
tan banded, and cream-white (a heavy patina).
The range of colors present among chert specimens in this collection
indicates that most of the raw materials were procured locally. Today, there are
extensive gravel bars along the active channel of the Brazos River in the area
where the collection was made. Evidence provided by the specimens indicates
that these same local resources were available in prehistoric times as well.
However, there are six large bifaces in the collection that range in length from
10-16 cm. The size of these specimens is such that the chert used in their
manufacture was probably not procured locally, as the chert cobbles now present
in the Brazos River gravel bars are not big enough to yield bifaces this large. In
one case (Specimen 7), Georgetown chert from Central Texas is unquestionably
represented. For the remaining large biface specimens, a raw material resource
area somewhere closer to Central Texas (i.e., to the west of Austin County) is
suggested.
Twenty-six of the chipped stone tools are probably made of heat-treated
chert. This observation is based on the presence of glossy or waxy sheens visible on the specimen surfaces and/or on atypical material colors such as pinkish-gray, reddish-brown or tan, tannish-orange, reddish-orange, or pinkish-tan.
Marine shell ornaments in this collection were modified to the extent that
a positive species identification cannot be made. A substantial number of marine shell artifacts collected from several other sites in the region were made
from the shells of a big conch called the lightning whelk, Busycon contrarium.
Big conchs of this species occur along the Texas gulf coast, which would have
been the closest source of the raw materials for specimens found in Austin
County. For marine shell artifacts of this type showing up elsewhere in the region, Hall (1981:222, 306) has suggested that the artifacts were imported from
Alabama or Florida. Steele (1988:238) has recently concurred with this view.

CHIPPED STONE
Thick Bifaces (Specimens 1-6). There are six thick bifaces in the collection. All except Specimen 6 are complete (Figure 1). Four of the specimens
retain patches of cortex on their faces or ends. Specimen 2 exhibits notching at
one end which formed a short stem or spur. Specimen 6 has a heavy patina.
Thin Bifacial Knives (Specimens 7-8). Two specimens are classified as
thin bifacial knives. Specimen 7 is a beveled knife made of mottled gray and
dark gray Georgetown chert (Figure 2). The chert appears to have been heattreated. Knives of this type are considered diagnostic of the Late Prehistoric
period. Specimen 8 is a triangular blade of tannish-gray chert. It, too, was probably heat-treated.
Unifacial Scraper (Specimen 9). There is one unifacial side- and end
scraper. It is made of dark brown and tan banded chert which was possibly heattreated.
Angostura (Specimen 10). This point is made of banded brown and dark
brown chert with speckles of patina; flaking is very fine. The chert appears to
have been heat-treated. This type is diagnostic of the Late Paleoindian period
from 6500 to 6000 B.C. (Turner and Hester 1985:66).
Lerma (Specimens 11-13). Specimen 11 is a finely flaked point made of
cream-white chert, its color a result of heavy patination. The stem edges are
heavily ground for a length of 3.2 cm up from the base. This artifact type is
diagnostic of the Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods (Suhm and Jelks
1962:168; Turner and Hester 1985:116).
Specimens 12 and 13 may be of the Lerma type, but the flaking and symmetry are not as precise as exhibited in Specimen 11. Specimen 12 is made of
brown chert which may have been heat-treated. No stem grinding is evident.
Specimen 13 is of dark gray chert. It is crudely flaked and no stem grinding
was detected.
Lanceolate (Specimen 14). Specimen 14 is a lanceolate-shaped thin biface.
It is made of tannish-gray chert with patches of patina. Flaking is coarse.
Leaf-Shaped (Specimen 15). This thin biface is made of light brown chert.
The blade edges are ground from the base upward for a length of 2.7 cm.
Bell (Specimen 16). This Bell dart point is made of light brown chert (Figure 3). One barb and shoulder are missing. The blade appears to have been reworked. There is one basal thinning flake scar. This type is diagnostic of the
Early Archaic period, dating from 6000 to 3500 B.C. (Turner and Hester
1985:72).
Bulverde (Specimens 17-18). Two dart points are typed Bulverde. Specimen 17 is made of brown chert with tan mottling. Specimen 18 is of light brown
chert. The distal tip and one barb are missing. This type is diagnostic of the
period from 3000 to 2500 B.C. (Suhm and Jelks 1962:170; Turner and Hester
1985:73).

Yarbrough (Specimens 19-21). Specimen 19 is made of mottled tan and
light brown chert. Specimen 20 is of brown heat-treated chert. Specimen 21 is
tan heat-treated chert. The type is diagnostic of the Early Archaic period (Suhm
and Jelks 1962:262; Turner and Hester 1985:160).
Morrill (Specimens 22-25). Four specimens correspond to the Morrill type,
an Early and Middle Archaic period diagnostic (Suhm and Jelks 1962:224;
Turner and Hester 1985:129). Chert colors represented include brown, light
brown, and tan. Specimen 59 has a frosting of patina and the chert appears to
have been heat-treated.

Morhiss (Specimens 26-28). Specimen 26 is made of tannish-cream heattreated chert. It compares favorably with the Morhiss type, diagnostic of the Late
Archaic period around 800 B.C. (Turner and Hester 1985:127-128). Specimens
27 and 28 lack stems, but have the size and blade outline characteristic of
Morhiss. Specimen 27 is of pinkish-gray chert with a gray stripe and spot. This
unusual color was probably imparted by heat-treating. Specimen 28 is made of
tannish-brown chert with brown speckles. This point is similar to the Johnson
type, an Early and Middle Archaic period diagnostic (Turner and Hester
1985:108-109).

Pontchartrain (Specimen 29). This long, slender dart point has the distal
tip broken off. The blade edges have been reworked, giving the blade a bevel.
The specimen is made of mottled tan and light brown chert. The Pontchartrain
type is diagnostic of the Middle to Transitional Archaic periods from 2000 B.C.
to A.D. 500 (Turner and Hester 1985:143).
Untyped Dart Point (Specimen 30). Specimen 30 is a long, broad sidenotched dart point. It is made of cream-gray chert which may be from the
Georgetown area of Texas. The chert appears to have been heat-treated.
Pedernales (Specimens 31-32). Specimen 31 is made of tan-brown chert
(Figure 4). There is a slight indentation in the base. It is quite well flaked.

Specimen 32 is of cream-tan chert. The distal tip and one blade edge display
impact fractures and one side of the stem is broken off. The Pedernales type is
diagnostic of the Middle Archaic period, from 2000 to 1200 B.C. (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:236-238; Turner and Hester 1985:139-140).
Kent (Specimens 33-34). Specimen 33 is made of light brown and reddishorange chert. This color probably resulted from heat treatment. There is a patch
of cortex on the base of the stem. Specimen 34 is of reddish-tan chert and was
made on a long flake. The striking platform is preserved on the stem base, and
there is a patch of cortex on one face. The blade edges are reworked and
crooked. The Kent type dates from the Middle through Transitional Archaic

periods from ca. 2000 B.C. to A.D. 500 (Suhm and Jelks 1962:200; Turner and
Hester 1985:110).
Palmillas (Specimen 35). This dart point is made of light brown chert. The
Palmillas type is diagnostic of the Middle and Late Archaic periods (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:230; Turner and Hester 1985:134).
Gary (Specimens 36-45). Ten dart points are typed Gary, diagnostic of the
Middle to Transitional Archaic periods from 2500 B.C. to A.D. 700 or 800
(Suhm and Jelks 1962:198; Turner and Hester 1985:101). Tan, brown, light
brown, and gray cherts predominate. Four specimens appear to be made of heattreated chert. Specimen 45 is made of brown petrified wood. It has a striking
platform at the proximal end and possible asphaltum or other hafting cement on
the stem.
Marcos (Specimen 46). This dart point is made of reddish-brown heattreated chert. The Marcos type dates to the Late Archaic and Transitional Archaic periods from 600 B.C. to A.D. 200 (Turner and Hester 1985:117).
Ensor (Specimen 47). The specimen is made of light gray chert. The Ensor
is characteristic of the Transitional Archaic period, from ca. 200 B.C. to A.D.
600 (Turner and Hester 1985:94).
Ellis (Specimen 48). Made of brown chert that appears to have been heattreated, Specimen 48 is frosted with patina (Figure 5). The Ellis type is diagnostic of the Middle to Transitional Archaic periods from 2000 B.C. to A.D.
700 (Turner and Hester 1985:93).
Edgewood (Specimen 49). Specimen 49 is made of tannish-orange heattreated chert. Edgewood is a Transitional Archaic type (Turner and Hester
1985:91).
Untyped Small Dart Points (Specimens 50-54). Specimen 50 is a
stemmed dart point made of cream chert. The stem is rectangular, expanding
slightly toward the straight base. The shoulders are pronounced, but not barbed.
Blade edges are slightly convex.
Specimen 51 is a side-notched dart point made of light brown chert. Blade
edges are straight to sightly convex.
Specimen 52 is an unusual bipointed thin biface. It is made of brown chert
that appears to have been heat-treated. One tip has been broken off. This artifact may have functioned as a perforator or drill.
Specimen 53 is a stemmed dart point made of brown chert. The blade edges
are pronouncedly convex. The stem has parallel sides and a slightly convex base,
and the shoulders are weak.
Specimen 54 is a triangular thin biface made of gray chert. This artifact is
probably an unfinished or discarded preform.
Scallorn (Specimens 55-61). Seven arrowpoints in the collection are typed
as Scallorns. Such artifacts are diagnostic of the early part of the Late Prehistoric period, from A.D. 700 to 1200 (Turner and Hester 1985:189). These points
are made of brown, light brown, tan-brown, cream-tan, or pinkish-tan cherts.

Specimen 67 is made of light brown chert. Its stem is missing.
Specimen 68 is made of reddish-brown chert. The color may be a result of
burning or heat treating.

GROUNDSTONE
From a regional standpoint, the two most unusual specimens in the
Cunningham-Gray collection are an adze and a celt. Both of these tools are made
of ground stone (Figure 6).
Celt (Figure 6A). The celt is made of light greenish-gray very fine-grained
diorite, an igneous rock. This material identification was made by Dr. Robert
Folk of the Department of Geology, The University of Texas at Austin. The
specimen has a length of 8 cm, a width of 4.7 cm, and a thickness of 2.5 cm.
Adze (Figure 6B). The adze is made of very dark gray slate or argillite, a
metamorphic rock, as identified by Dr. Folk. This adze is subrectangular in
outline shape, tapering slightly from a maximum width at the distal or bit end
down to the narrower proximal end. It is 15.4 cm in length, 4.8 cm in width,
and 1.0 cm thick. Centered on the specimen, and 4.1 cm from the proximal end,
is a biconically drilled perforation having a diameter of 0.5 cm. Around this hole
on one face of the adze is a patch of black substance suggestive of a hafting
cement, perhaps asphaltum or aged tree sap. Embedded within this black substance are flecks of a material which, at low-power magnification, appear to be
wood. If the black substance is indeed hafting cement, it is possible that it has
preserved vestiges of a wooden handle once attached to the adze. On both faces
of the piece, striations and scratches are visible, apparently resulting from the
grinding originally done to work it into its present shape. The bit is very dull,
actually having been flattened. The dulling seems to have been intentional, rather
than the result of use.
Dr. Folk notes that the metamorphic slate or argillite and igneous diorite
used to make the adze and celt are not found naturally anywhere in Texas east
of the Big Bend. Given their characteristics, he suggests that the Ouachita Mountains of western Arkansas are the most likely source of the rocks.

MARINE SHELL ORNAMENTS
Twelve marine shell ornaments are present in the Cunningham-Gray collection (Figure 7). As mentioned above, the species of the shells cannot be positively identified, but it is believed to be the conch known as the lightning whelk,
B. contrarium. Outline shapes vary from triangular, to oval, to subcircular, to
rectangular and trapezoidal. Ten of the shells have single perforations. One has

two holes and another has three; both conical and biconical holes were drilled
to make the perforations. Metric attributes for these shell ornaments are provided in Table 2.
Specimen 1 1 is unusual in that each face has a single groove running the
length of the piece (see Figure 7). On one face the groove is centered over the
perforation, while on the other side, the groove is offset to one edge. On Specimen 6 the edges of the perforation are smooth and highly polished, as if by the
repeated action of a cord drawn through the hole.

DISCUSSION
The Cunningham-Gray collection is noteworthy for the long sequence of
prehistoric activity evidenced by the time-diagnostic artifacts present. In this
respect, however, it is not atypical of the general region of Southeast Texas it
represents. Patterson (1985, 1989) and Patterson et al. (1987) have shown that
there are a number of sites in the region having similar lengthy sequences of
occupation. Based on the available diagnostics, the sequence began 8,000 to
8,500 years ago as suggested by the presence of an Angostura point and a
possibly related lanceolate thin biface with basal edge grinding. The Early,
Middle, and Late Archaic periods are each represented by a variety of chipped
stone types. Scallorn and Perdiz arrow points mark activity during the Late
Prehistoric period from around A.D. 700 to perhaps as late as A.D. 1500. For
all of the prehistoric periods represented in the Cunningham-Gray collection,
the artifacts present are well within the range of types to be expected for this
part of Texas.
Most of the chipped stone artifacts were probably made out of locally
available cherts, the gravel bars of the nearby Brazos River being the most likely
source of raw materials used. However, the large thick bifaces and thin bifacial
knives are made from cores too large to have originated locally. Lithic resource

areas further west must have been utilized. In the case of one large beveled knife
(Specimen 7), chert obviously originating in the Georgetown area along the
Balcones Escarpment was used in its manufacture.
The presence of two ground stone artifacts and a number of marine shell
ornaments in the Cunningham-Gray collection suggests that one or more human burials may have eroded out of the site(s) that were being collected. Area
sites containing Middle or Late Archaic cemetery components, such as Albert
George (Walley 1955), Ernest Witte (Hall 1981), and Ferguson (Patterson et aI.
1993), have previously yielded ground stone artifacts and marine shell orna-

ments found as grave inclusions. Such specimens are rarely recovered from noncemetery habitational contexts (Hall n.d.)
Most of the ground stone artifacts from the Albert George site (a boatstone),
Ernest Witte (boatstones and a gorget), and Ferguson (tubular beads), are made
of igneous and meta-sedimentary rocks originating in the Ouachita Mountains,
perhaps near Little Rock, Arkansas. The celt and adze reported here are also
made of lithic raw materials most likely derived from that same region. Thus,
the raw material resource area for these ground stone specimens had been indicated by previous finds. However, the artifact types --celt and adze -- are a
rare occurrence in Southeast Texas. Their presence in the Cunningham-Gray collection permits expansion of the assemblage of ground stone artifacts derived
from the Ouachita Mountains to include, most commonly, boatstones and beads,
followed by single reports of a gorget, celt, and adze.
The presence of marine shell ornaments in the Cunningham-Gray collection
is consistent with findings made at a number of other sites in the region, including Albert George (Walley 1955), Ernest Witte (Hall 1981), and Crestmont
(Vernon 1989). Further afield are sites such as 41BX1 (Lukowski 1988) and the
Texas West Indies Ranch site (Birmingham and Huebner 1991). In all of these
cases, the shells were found as inclusions in Late Archaic graves. The outline
shapes and patterns of perforations represented in the Cunningham-Gray specimens are most like specimens found at the Ernest Wite site (Hall 1981). As
previously mentioned, a gulf coastal source in Alabama or Florida has been
suggested for the marine shell ornaments showing up in the Late Archaic cemeteries of Southeast Texas (Hall 1981:222, 306; Steele 1988:238).
The Cunningham-Gray collection lends support to certain of the trends in
the material culture previously recognized for the prehistory of Southeast Texas.
It has chipped stone diagnostics indicating a long sequence of prehistoric cultural activity in the area. The ground stone adze and celt, and the marine shell
ornaments, provide additional evidence of participation in an exchange network,
~robably most active during the Late Archaic period, that linked the prehistoric
inhabitants of this region ultimately to distant raw material resource areas in
Arkansas and perhaps even farther to the northeast in Alabama or Florida.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I thank the property owner and the individuals in possession of the artifact
collection described here for their cooperation in permitting site survey activities
and documentation of the specimens. The assistance that Joe Hudgins gave me in
surveying the collection recovery area was greatly appreciated. I also thank Dr.
Robert Folk for his identifications of the rock types used to make the ground
stone artifacts.

The Dillard Site: A Late Prehistoric Plains Village
Site In Cooke County, Texas
Ernest R. Martin

ABSTRACT
Archeological investigations were conducted in 1985 in Cooke County, Texas,
on an alluvial terrace where a prehistoric site had been discovered on the north
side of Fish Creek near its junction with the Red River. The site was occupied
between ca. A.D. 1100 and 1450 (the Late Prehistoric I and II periods). The
village site was occupied by peoples who were possibly the precursors of
some historic Wichita bands. Village occupants took part in a number of
activities: hunting, gathering, fishing, horticulture, food storage, pottery manufacture, housing construction, basket-making, clothing production, making and
maintaining weapons and tools, and trading with other villages.

INTRODUCTION
This article concerns archeological investigations at the Dillard site
(41CO174), named after one of the landowners, Mr. Dutch Dillard. The site was
discovered in 1985 on an alluvial terrace where Fish Creek once had emptied into
Red River. Today’s river channel lies 0.8 km east of the site. Another creek,
Bearhead, also joins Fish Creek near this point and borders the west side of the
site (Figure 1). The site is some 20 km northwest of Gainesville, Texas, and 2.4
km downstream from the Hubert H. Moss Lake dam. The site is accessible only
via a private road through the Dillard-Monroe Ranch.
The labor involved in the investigation of this site was accomplished by the
author, an avocational archeologist, with the help of friends, family, and other
interested volunteers. Excavations at the Dillard site were undertaken to primarily recover information about, and also corroborate the existing data concerning,
Late Prehistoric cultures in the Red River valley of North Central Texas.

Red River. Located in extreme North Central Texas, the site lies midway between
the Eastern Cross Timbers and the Grand Prairie geographical regions. The
unique micro-environmental setting of the Red River crosscuts these two larger
geographic units: heavily wooded limestone hills and bluffs next to flat, sandy
terraces at the river bends and where major streams enter.
The alluvial terrace was probably formed at the time of one of the three
terrace-cutting episodes that have occurred regionally during the last 9000 years.
The alluvial downcutting may have resulted from great amounts of runoff created by abundant local precipitation as well as spring snowmelt from the northwestern tributaries of Red River (Gilbert 1980:15).
The general shape of the deposits of deep sands above the terrace shelf
suggests subsequent localized deposition by floods. During these later flood
episodes, the river current by the site moved away from a high rocky bluff 300
m north of where the tributary waters of the Fish-Bearhead system enter the Red
River. These backwater conditions resulted in the deposition of great amounts
of fine river sand on the terrace, forming a high ridge along its length, ending
with a promontory on the southeast end overlooking Fish Creek.
The soil type at the south end of the site is the Teller series, a deep welldrained loamy soil formed in alluvial deposits. As one approaches the hill on
the north end of the site, the soil changes to the Venus series. This is also a
deep, well-drained loamy soil, but it formed through erosion of thick beds of
calcareous loamy sediments. The soil along the banks of Fish and Bearhead
creeks is Frio clay loam, common to low terraces and floodplains in this area
(USDA Soil Conservation Service 1979:60-62).
The surrounding bluffs are comprised of three primary geological layers.
The lowest is a narrow band of Cretaceous (Comanche series) sandstone. This
is overlaid with a narrow band of Goodland limestone, and the highest part of
the bluffs is capped with a harder layer of Kiamichi limestone (Lorrain 1969:5).
The valleys are wooded in most areas with deciduous oaks and hickories, walnut, and pecan, especially near the streams and hillsides. The upland plateau is
sparsely wooded, but covered with many native grasses that once were common on the tall grass prairies of North Central Texas.
The local climate has probably not changed much over the past 800 years
(see Collins and Bousman 1993). Current average low temperatures in January
are 32° F, while the average high temperature for July is 96° (Texas Almanac
1988). The annual rainfall averages about 110 cm (Gainesville Daily Register,
April 1992). This environment would lend itself very well then, as it does now,
to dry land farming.
The variety and population of the fauna in the area is not as great as it was
in the past when the site was occupied, but most of the native animals are still
present. Animals indigenous in former times, but not present today inc!’:de:
American bison, pronghorn antelope, mountain lion, gray wolf, black bear, and
the wapiti or elk (Kawecki and Wyckoff 1984:13). Among the animals still
observed today are: whitetail deer, coyote, gray fox, opossum, skunk, mink,

bobcat, beaver, ringtail cat, rodents (fox squirrel, cottontail rabbit, jackrabbit,
ground squirrel, cotton rat, harvest mouse, white-footed mouse, mole, shrew),
western box turtle, snakes (bullsnake, western diamondback rattlesnake, glossy
snake, copperhead, cottonmouth water moccasin, diamondback watersnake, king
snake, blue racer, chicken snake), bull frog, eastern fence lizard, glass lizard,
salamanders, turkey, quail, and a host of migratory wild fowl.
The waters of both the creeks and rivers contained native fishes, reptiles,
mollusks, and aquatic plants. Some fauna likely available during the Late Prehistoric period would include: alligator gar, catfish, shad, drum, buffalo, white
bass, bream, sunfish, rock bass, paddlefish, alligator snapping turtle, soft shelled
turtle, red eared turtle, freshwater mussels, and crayfish.
Major flora in the surrounding forests comprise post oak, pin oak, burr oak,
red oak, blackjack oak, bois d’arc (osage orange), cottonwood, pecan, black
walnut, hickory, hackberry, hawthorne, ash, juniper, elm, willow, poplar, sycamore, and salt cedar. Among the flora found at water’s edge, or within the
water, are cattails, arrowroot, duckweed, watercress, and wild grapes.

ARCHEOLOGICALBACKGROUND
It has long been established that the Red River valley of North Central
Texas was periodically occupied by prehistoric hunters and gatherers for many
thousands of years. By about A.D. 700, farming groups began to settle in parts
of the region, especially along the Red River (e.g., Brooks 1994a).
It was once a common notion that the development of farming societies in
the Southern Plains was a product of new influences created when migrants from
the eastern woodlands (i.e., East Texas) brought new technologies with them,
forcing the existing inhabitants to move elsewhere. Current thinking suggests
that settlement-subsistence changes were due more to an exchange of ideas with
adjacent sedentary groups, ultimately resulting in population increases and social organizational changes (Story 1981:146). In either case, these cultural
changes directly affected the lifestyles of prehistoric inhabitants in the North
Central Texas region. Prikryl (1990:77) refers to this as the Late Prehistoric I
period, and it lasted from about A.D. 700 to A.D. 1250. During this time, permanent and semi-permanent villages, both large and small, began to appear near
springs and on large stream terraces in all major fiver valleys in North Texas
and southern Oklahoma. In Cooke County, the sites concentrate on the Cross
Timbers-Grand Prairie boundary in the Elm Fork drainage, and on terraces and
stream valleys near the Red River.
The bow and arrow technology was introduced in the Late Prehistoric I
period. It was a great improvement in weaponry over the dart-atlatl. Arrows had
an improved accuracy and longer range than darts, thus increasing the hunter’s
success. Bow and arrow utilization spawned new hunting techniques since an
arrow, unlike a dart, could be accurately launched from a crouched, hidden

Martin ~ The Dillard Site

109

position, or from a tree, allowing the hunter to get a closer shot at his target.
Such an improvement increased the chances of success when game was plentiful, and thereby decreased the need to move often to obtain enough meat for
each community. The appearance of this new technology, coinciding with a resurgence of bison populations on the Southern Plains, significantly increased
the available food supply. As a testament to their hunting successes, bison bones
began to appear with greater frequency from village sites that were inhabited
during this period (Lynott 1979).
Large herds of bison had been rare on the Southern Plains for several centuries, but around A.D. 1 I00, they began to appear in greater numbers (Hughes
1988:7). It has been proposed that bison herds pushed southward into Texas
three times during the Holocene, between 10,000 to 6000 or 5000 B.C., between
2500 B.C. and A.D. 500, and between A.D. 1200 or A.D. 1300 to 1500 (Dillehay
1974). Bison herds, which required large amounts of fresh water to both drink
and wallow in, would be more commonly found near the vicinity of the large
streams and rivers during the drier months, when only these larger streams held
sufficient water. Bison were more likely hunted and killed at ford areas when
they sought out these streams, instead of by stalking the herds on the open tallgrass prairie and plains.
The introduction of horticulture probably had the greatest influence upon
village populations and settlement locations than did any other major cultural
changes that occurred during this period (Prikryl 1987:173). Farming, supplemented by more efficient hunting, supplied a larger population with not only its
immediate needs, but produced enough surplus to allow the populace to place
less emphasis on a seasonal-round subsistence pattern. Although hunting and
gathering forays continued throughout the Late Prehistoric periods, the village
remained as a permanent base camp and was unlikely to have been completely
abandoned at any time (Lorrain 1969).
The technology involved in the manufacturing of ceramics may have been
introduced to North Texas from two different areas. These areas included East
Texas, where pottery crafting began about A.D. 200-300 (Story 1981), and the
Plains, where crafting techniques were learned from Southwestern potters. Pottery vessels, being fragile and easily broken, were not as practical for highly
nomadic cultures, and evidence for their manufacture and use is typically observed when a population became somewhat sedentary. This is one explanation
for its increased use in agricultural societies on the Southern Plains, although
the technology for pottery manufacture might have been available much earlier.
The raw materials necessary for the production of pottery, red clay and pulverized mussel shells, were abundant along the Red River and its tributaries.
The establishment of villages on the banks of the large navigable streams
increased the chances of contact with other contemporary Late Prehistoric cultures, and opportunities for trade (Brooks 1994a). Trade items originating considerable distances from North Texas have been found associated with Late
Prehistoric cultures in the Red River valley, including: stone tool types and raw

110

materials, Olivella and conch shell, and pottery from the Southwest and the
Caddoan Area. The Red River was analogous to a natural highway that could
be followed by pedestrians or navigated by dugout canoe (Albert 1984:1).
This indigenous population evolved an agriculturally-based Plains Village
lifestyle, but increased their dependence upon bison hunting during the Late
Prehistoric II period (Prikryl 1990), or what Krieger (1946) defined as the
Henrietta Focus. These people may have been the forebears of some of those
more northern groups of the Nortefio Focus in North Texas, and along with the
descendents of the nearby Washita River phase, are possibly part of the ancestral
stock of the Wichita Indians (Duffield and Jelks 1961:73-75; Blaine 1990).
These innovations were well entrenched in Plains Village groups in North
Central Texas. Sites of this period, from ca. A.D. 1250-1700 (Prikryl 1990:80),
have tool assemblages that are characteristic of the Southern Plains Village
cultural tradition (e.g., Brooks 1994a).
The artifact assemblage and recognizable features that were found at the
Harrell Site, the type site for the Henrietta Focus, includes: arrowpoints of
Fresno, Washita, Alba, Scallorn, Cliffton, and Young types; drills; scrapers (end,
side, and oval); gravers; gouges; worked flakes of obsidian, quartz crystal, and
Alibates dolomite; cores; sandstone abraders, manos, and metates; elbow pipes
and fragments; bone awls and fish hooks; deer ulna and antler flaking tools; hoe
blades of bison scapulae; unperforated shell hoes; Nocona Plain shell-tempered
pottery; trade sherds from southeast New Mexico and the Frankston phase of
East Texas; hammerstones; bifaces; four beveleff and two beveled knives; spokeshaves; tubular bone beads; Olivella beads; fossil crinoid beads; mussel shell
beads; and pottery beads (Krieger 1946:103-119). Other important traits noted by
Krieger (1946) were post molds on the site indicating permanent house structures, the placement of burials in the village midden, the absence of burial goods,
the appearance of multiple burials with missing body parts, and a wide range in
burial depths.
The artifact assemblage from sites labeled Henrietta Focus in the central
Red River valley has characteristics of both the Southern Plains and eastern
Caddo cultures. Artifacts recovered from the Dillard site and other Lake Texoma
area sites that may have been traded or exchanged with Caddoan peoples are:
deer jaw sickles, hide grainers, pottery, shell beads, Reeds Spring chert, novaculite, copper, and long-stemmed pottery pipes. Although these items only occasionally occur in Late Prehistoric II period sites in the upper Brazos and Trinity
River drainages, they occur quite frequently in the middle Red River valley (Bell
1980; Albert 1984).
While most Late Prehistoric II village sites seem to be small, some sites
appear to have covered several acres; most sites range between one and five acres
in size (Krieger 1946:138). While the villages were the focal points of community life, nearby seasonal campsites and farmsteads were regularly maintained
for the purposes of farming, hunting, and gathering. These associated sites were
probably occupied only during the warmer times of the year. They were also

Martin ~ The Dillard Site

111

more common in the earlier Late Prehistoric I period (e.g., Lorrain 1969:106).
Five such suspected satellite sites have been discovered by surface surveys and
test sondages surrounding the Dillard site.
Although historic Wichita villages were of similar size, they sometimes
chose favored sites as gathering places, usually in the fall, where the people
could have the opportunity to visit, trade, and hunt bison. The villages at these
times could become quite large, extending more than a km along a river or
stream bank (Smith 1959:526). This is a practice that might have commenced in
the Late Prehistoric II period, because such activity would have allowed the
villagers to have more regular encounters with other Plains Village groups,
especially after the large bison herds appeared on the Southern Plains.

SITE SETTING AND DISCOVERY
No major archeological site had been previously reported near the immediate confluence of Fish Creek in northwestern Cooke County, Texas, and the Red
River. One large site and some smaller associated sites were discovered and
excavated upstream on Fish Creek in 1966 by Southern Methodist University
before the completion of the Moss Lake dam (Lorrain 1969). The largest, the
Chickenhouse site (X41CO6), was thought to be a permanent base village, while
the smaller surrounding sites were used seasonally as camps for farming, hunting, and gathering. It was concluded that the occupation of the sites occurred
around A.D. 850-1000.
Radiocarbon dates were obtained on charred corncobs from the
Chickenhouse site. These dates were A.D. 1280, 1360, 1470, and 1630. These
dates were considered too young for the anticipated age of this site (Lorrain
1969:111), and that the process of fractionation in carbon isotopes, which occurs
in corn, was responsible for the false later dates. It is currently thought that
radiocarbon dates from corn remains that have not been corrected for fractionation, consistently yield dates about 200 years too young (see Bowman 1990:2021). This entire site, however, had been a farmhouse and chickenhouse complex
for the previous 75 to 80 years. The increased amount of organic debris deposition, the application of fertilizers, and the regular tilling of the garden located
there, may have increased a contaminant’s filtration into the soil, thus affecting
the tested sample while in situ (Joukowsky 1980:448).
The Chickenhouse site is 5.6 km upstream from the confluence of Fish
Creek with the Red River. I suspected that if there was suitable terrain farther
downstream, a similar significant Late Prehistoric site should be discovered
there. The most probable location of such a site was thought to be near where
Fish Creek merged with the Red River.
In May 1984, a terrace bench at the present confluence of Fish Creek and
Red River was surveyed, but the area was too low in the floodplain to be
suitable for sustained human occupation. The highest level of this terrace was

112

Texas Archeological Society

5.4 m above the present normal level of Red River. Fish Creek enters the river
from the north at an acute angle with the west bank (Figure 2). The land
between the creek and the river is a floodplain covered by small salt cedars
interspersed with occasional groups of larger hardwood trees. The elevation of
this area ranges between 2.4 to 3.6 m above the river level, and the terrain is
prone to regular flooding. A decision was made to survey an area about 2.5 km
upstream on Fish Creek, where a higher, flat, contour elevation was observed
on a topographical map.

On May 31, 1985, after obtaining permission from the landowner, the site
was located within an hour. While driving through a pasture on the north side
of Fish Creek, a high, gently sloping alluvial terrace was observed running northsouth on the eastern side of the pasture. The south end dropped off sharply about
60 m from Fish Creek. Another stream, Bearhead Creek, entered Fish Creek
about 90 m southwest of the terrace. Later, after interviewing the landowner, it
was learned that the previous owner had recounted that the river channel had
run along the eastern edge of this terrace until around the 1890s, when increased
soil erosion and resultant silting from area farming had presumably changed the
river’s course. Fish Creek now follows the west bank of the former river channel to its junction with the present river channel (see Figure 2).
The total area of the site is approximately five acres, of which about 50
percent has been previously cultivated. The southern end of the site was relatively undisturbed from cultivation. A small roadcut had been made running
laterally away from the site on its eastern edge. This allowed vehicles to drive
down from the terrace to the lower river bottoms. Most of the cultural deposits
at the Dillard site had been covered with 30 to 35 cm of sterile sand that was
either blown onto the site from the riverbank during dry periods, or deposited
during post-occupation floods (see below). Although a part of the site had been
under cultivation at one time, the plow zone rarely reached the occupied strata.
In the unplowed areas of the site, original surface features--such as depressions
and rises that were possibly formed during the prehistoric occupation--are still
evident on the present surface.
Confirmation that the site had a prehistoric occupation was accomplished
by excavating a small test pit on one of the higher points of the terrace. Lithic
debris, mussel shell, charcoal, bone fragments, and one pottery sherd were recovered. Plans were made to begin excavation in the fall of 1985 after site
mapping and surveys were completed.
The elevation of the site is 670.1 feet above mean sea level. This elevation places the site approximately 9 m above the normal present day level of
Red River, making this an area well above normal flooding. However, a
record flood did occur while the site was being excavated in June 1987. The
water then reached an elevation of 675 feet, and was the greatest Red River
flood in this area.

GOALS AND PURPOSE

The limited archeological investigations previously completed on sites
along this part of Red River, although well done, have not provided a sufficient
sample of material culture remains and features to be truly representative of the
cultures that left them. Although a good general knowledge of the Late Prehistoric cultures in North Texas and southern Oklahoma has been attained, there
are many details about these groups that have not been learned. While perhaps

114

Texas Archeological Society

not as culturally complex as the Caddoan cultures of East Texas, Southern Plains
villagers represented an era of high cultural achievement for the prehistoric
Native Americans who lived in what is now Cooke County, Texas.
The Dillard site (41CO174) was apparently occupied continuously for a
period perhaps as long as 400 years, but during only the Late Prehistoric I and
II periods. This provides an excellent opportunity for comparative investigations
of the nature of Late Prehistoric artifact assemblage changes through time along
this part of Red River, and in this relatively unknown Southern Plains locale.
The site is also unusually well preserved. The abundance of charcoal and other
available carbon sources at this site provided good samples for radiocarbon
dating. The site had no subsequent occupation after the Late Prehistoric II period, and the samples were expected to be free of organic contamination. Bone
and plant remains were also preserved in quantity.
Several research problems concerning the Late Prehistoric period in North
Central Texas were of interest in our investigations of the Dillard site. When
beginning the excavations, it was hoped that new information could be obtained
that would shed some light on the following questions:
o What were the social relationships between neighboring contemporary
Plains village groups? By using archeological data obtained from previous
excavations on Fish Creek (Lorrain 1969), periods of occupation of the two
sites could be compared in several ways. Were these sites utilized before,
during, or after the occupation of the Dillard site? If the periods of occupation did overlap, were there exchanges of food, raw materials, or finished
items between the villages at this time?

¯ Are there discernible differences in the artifact assemblages between the
Dillard site and other adjacent Late Prehistoric sites (whether in the Red
River valley or not), and if such differences exist, what do they imply about
cultural affiliation and variations in lifestyles?
¯ What types of raw materials and finished items were available through trade
to the people of the Late Prehistoric era in this area? Where were the
original sources of these trade items, and by what means did they arrive?
Increased contact with other groups through trade likely would increase the
chances of spreading new concepts from different cultural foci, and such
cultural exchanges may have significantly affected the lifestyles of Late
Prehistoric Plains Villagers during the time they changed from a semisedentary to a sedentary society.
¯ What was the nature of the burial customs that the Late Prehistoric groups
of this area employed in their culture? Insights regarding the ceremonial
practices of these people would be obtained with these investigations.
Grave offerings are rare from burial sites in North Texas and southern
Oklahoma, and when burial offerings are present, shell beads are the predominate items.

The Dillard site contains important archeological data. An obligation was
recognized when work began to excavate and preserve on record a small part of
this site before indiscriminate relic collecting, future agricultural operations, or
possible gravel mining ventures damaged or destroyed it. By revealing the
wealth of new, and significant, archeological information that can be recovered
from this site, it is hoped that this will create a heightened awareness of its need
for preservation for future generations to appreciate and learn from.

METHODS
Excavations at Dillard began on September 15, 1985. Two permanent datum
points were established and a contour elevation map was plotted (Figure 3).
Eleven sondages were excavated to roughly define the extent of the site, and to
assess the density of cultural materials. These sondages were placed at wide
intervals along the length of the terrace ridge, as well as near the bluff of the
former river channel. Occupational debris extended 202.5 m along the terrace,
but was concentrated mostly at the south end nearest the junction of Fish Creek
with the old river channel.
The sterile orange-colored overburden was well defined, and was removed
by hand using a sharpshooter. A square-ended shovel was employed to level unit
floors at the top of the occupied zone, after which the soil was removed in 2-inch
(5 cm) layers using a trowel or shovel. The soil was damp in the winter, which
aided the identification of soil and cultural features. The dampness allowed the
soil to be easily scraped, and it usually screened easily. The excavation was
unencumbered by large tree roots or rocks. All dirt removed from the excavation
was screened through either a 1/4-inch or 1/8-inch mesh screen. The screened
soil was bagged and labeled by unit and level, then transported to the backyard
lab and washed on 1/8-inch screens. The debris was cleaned of sticks and roots,
and then dried and bagged for sorting.
Due to the depth of the cultural zone, 1.5 x 1.5 m units were used to allow
for more working room within an individual unit. The depth of the excavations in
the areas of the site used for dwellings varied between 0.95 and 1.05 m in depth.
Cultural features and larger artifacts were plotted on overview maps; lithic
flakes, small fragments of charcoal, small potsherds, hearthstone fragments less
than 3 cm in size, and small bone fragments recovered through screening, were
not plotted. However, all of the unplotted items were recovered by unit and level.
The plan for subsequent block excavations was based upon information
gathered from the sondages. The accumulation of village debris increased from
the center of the terrace to the southeast edge of the site. Based upon this
information, it was decided to locate the major excavation on the end of the
terrace as it began to slope downward toward the old river’s edge. If there was a
deep midden accumulation here as indicated by test sondages, a much larger
sampling of artifacts could be obtained that would be best representative of the

lifestyles of these Plains Villagers, as opposed to a more restricted sample that
could be gathered from a similar-sized excavation within the village proper.
Photographs of the floors of each excavated unit were made, and a mosaic
of the entire block showing structural remains, etc., was assembled for future
reference. Photographs of each block’s stratigraphy, selected objects in situ, and
the general progress of the excavations, were also taken.

STRATIGRAPHY
The sterile overburden covering the site ranged from 30-37 cm over most of
the site area, with the exception of one area in Block 3 where it was almost
nonexistent. The darkly stained soil of the occupation zone varied between 60
and 65 cm in thickness.
The overburden covering the site was mainly deposited during the dry
summers, when prevailing south winds whipped loose sand from the river’s
edge. Additional deposition of this sterile layer came in the form of silt from
post-occupation floods. In either case, the sand settled mainly on the more
protected lower slopes on the ridge’s northern side, and tended to settle less on
the more exposed southern areas and prominent points.
No identifiable stratification could be discerned in the occupied zone except
for a few widely scattered lenses of ash and lightly colored sand. Cultural
features such as post molds and hearths were abundant. Clearly, the occupation
zone had been disturbed by cultural activities, and in many places the primary
deposits had been disrupted by house and hearth construction in addition to
burial and refuse deposition. To keep records of vertical context, three 15 cm
thick arbitrary stratigraphic levels were assigned, beginning at the top of the
occupied zone, with level four including all materials more than 45 cm below the
top of Level 1.
The soil present in the occupation zone at the Dillard site consisted of fine,
moist sand infused with small bits of red clay and mussel shell, along with an
abundance of charcoal, ashes, and organic humus. The normally tan-orange color
of the sand was changed into a dark brown, almost black color by anthropogenic
means, and in many areas had a slight gummy texture when damp.

FEATURES
Block 1
The first block was a linear trench measuring 1.5 x 9 m (Units F-1 to K-1).
The block ran in a northwest/southeast direction to follow the orientation of the
terrace ridge on the northeast edge of the site (Figure 4). The excavation of this
block indicated that the area had been used for repeated housing; that is, an area
where dwellings or other buildings were constructed, torn down, and rebuilt over
a period of many years of continuous occupation. Scattered post molds were
identified throughout this block, but they had no definable pattern to suggest the
types or sizes of former structures (Figure 5). Expansion of this block would
probably yield more information about the types and sizes of the structures, but
the limited work force prohibited doing so at the time.
The post molds in Block 1 ranged in size from 5 to 20 cm in diameter. There
was an abundance of fragmentary, burned hearthstones throughout the block,

with a noticeable concentration of larger fragments recovered from unit H-1 (see
Figure 5). These pieces were accompanied by thousands of charcoal fragments
and ash mixed with the soil. This suspected hearth area was next to one of the
larger post molds, suggesting that it might have been near the center of a house.
Hundreds of fragments of animal bones were found scattered throughout
the block. Tools made from animal bone were also recovered here, particularly

in unit J-1 where two bone awls, two deer jaw sickles, and two deer ulna flaking tools were found (Figure 6). Four arrowpoints and an unusually large amount
of lithic debris were also recovered from this grid, indicating that this was once
an often-used work area. The broken bones of bison and deer were the most
frequent faunal remains from Block 1. Fish, mussels, turtle, turkey, and rodent
bones comprised the balance of the identifiable animal remains. Large numbers

120

of small mammal and bird bones were also recovered from the block. Plant
remains from Block 1 included charred walnut, hickory, pecan, and hackberry
shells.

121

An unusual cluster of fossilized oyster shells was recovered from a unit in
Level 4 of Block 1. Their use, or significance, if any, has not been determined,
but they are not naturally found in the sandy alluvium of the site. Their likely
origin is the limestone deposits of the surrounding bluffs or the limestone gravel
of Bearhead Creek.

Block 2
The excavation of Block 2 took place during the second season of work
at the Dillard site, and began on September 26, 1986. This block was located
some 4.5 m southwest of Block 1 on the opposite side of the terrace ridge
(see Figure 4).
The excavation of this block had two purposes. One was to explore that
part of the site nearer the point of the terrace, where cultural materials were
shown by sondages to be more concentrated. The other goal was to uncover a
wider area in an attempt to locate and delineate any structural remains that would
be overlooked in trench excavations. Six 1.5 x 1.5 m units were eventually
excavated in Block 2. More units were planned, but an interruption caused by a
June 1987 flood damaged equipment and grid walls, while depositing a foot of
muck in the floor of the excavation, delayed further work at the site for three
months. All damage had to be repaired before the excavation of the block could
continue.
In Units E-5, E-6, and F-6, a hearth was uncovered. Other large stones were
scattered nearby (Figure 7). Small bits of charcoal were found in and around the
stones, and the stones themselves had the characteristic gray color of burned
limestone. One of the hearthstones was the broken half of a mano.
The dark occupation zone of Block 2 became thicker and sloped upward
towards the present ground surface as the excavation approached the southwest
end of the terrace. This thicker layer of cultural debris is characteristic of a
midden or communal refuse heap. Cultural materials such as animal bones and
lithic debris, pottery sherds, and hearthstones increased in numbers as the excavations progressed in this part of Block 2. The numerous post molds uncovered
in all of the levels of Block 2 indicate that throughout the occupation of the
site, several structures had been erected here, but only one possible house pattern could be identified. The intermittent dumping of trash at the end of the
terrace may have begun when these first houses were constructed, and continued until the site was abandoned.
The occupation zone in Block 2 was similar in depth to that of Block 1, but
generally the sterile overburden was shallower: the overburden ranged from 2528 cm in depth. The shallowest overburden was present along the southeast edge
of the block.
Block 2, like Block 1, also was an area where houses had been constructed
successively over many years. Because of the limited area of the excavation, no

122

Texas Archeological Society

complete outline of post molds was identified consistent with the size of a
house’s circumference (Figure 8). Although not entirely exposed, the linear
curvature of some post molds suggests a structure with a diameter of
approximately 6.6-7.5 m. A rock hearth (Feature 1) was located near the center
of the post pattern (see Figure 7).

~nest Mar~in

Figure 7. Block 2 plan map showing features, postmolds, and artifact locations.

An unusual soil feature was observed in Unit D-5: a long, dark, curved stain
2 x 87 cm in size. It is most likely the burned remains of a narrow piece of
wood from the house superstructure, or alternatively a debris-filled animal
burrow.

and floor of Unit D-6.

The cultural zone in Block 2 was generally thicker than that found in Block
1:65-70 cm. Animal bone fragments, charcoal, and small burned hearthstone
fragments were greater in Block 2 than Block 1. Bison and deer again dominate

124

Texas Archeological Society

the identifiable faunal remains. In the two lower levels, deer bones appear almost
exclusively, with bison bones appearing more often in the higher, younger, levels
of the cultural deposit. Other identifiable faunal remains included turtle, fish,
mussel, turkey, snails, rabbit, rodent, and dog.
Plant remains from Block 2 included charred hulls of walnuts, hickory nuts,
pecans, and chestnuts. In Unit E-6 at Level 4, adjacent to some larger hearthstones, charred wood and five fragments of charred corncob were also recovered.
This was the first positive evidence of horticulture at the site. The corn had at
least six to eight rows of kernels per cob. One cob fragment appears to have
seven rows, but examination of modern "Indian maize" also displays this scar
near the end of the cob when two rows of kernels fail to develop.
The artifact assemblage from Block 2 comprised 10 arrowpoints of the
following types: Washita, Scallorn, Bonham, and Fresno. One Washita point
recovered from unit E-6 was made of obsidian. Other items recovered from
Block 2 were: notches, a bison digging tip, bone awls, fossilized oyster shells,
adzes, bifaces, scrapers, deer jaw sickles, abrading stones, unifaces, milling stone
fragments, a mano, a flaking tool (deer ulna), and ochre stones from the local
Woodbine Sand Formation.
Several large sherds of Nocona Plain ceramics were recovered from this
block. Fragments of the rim and enough of the body were recovered to show that
they were from a large vessel (35 cm in diameter) of local manufacture. Another
pottery sherd was identified as part of a pipe bowl.
A fragment of reddish colored hematite was also found in Block 2. This
piece contained a section of a dril! hole and was ground and smoothed on the
unbroken surface. The soft nature of the stone suggested that it had been heavily
ground to obtain pigment.

Block 3
The excavation of Block 3 began on November 20, 1987. A decision had
earlier been made to locate this block nearer the point of the terrace, southeast of
the previous blocks (see Figure 4). This part of the site was considered a suitable
area for a refuse dump as it is near the edge of the terrace, and would have been
out of the way of most village activities. The first 1.5 x 1.5 m unit in Block 3
began in Unit A-3 (Figure 9). The block exposed a thick midden infused with
faunal remains, pottery, lithic debris, and stone tools.
As excavations began, it was noted that the sand overburden was virtually
absent. The dark soil of the occupation zone was encountered within 2 cm of the
surface, and cultural debris was also recovered just beneath the surface. Shortly
after the removal of this superficial layer had begun, the left anterior section of a
human skull (Burial 1) was uncovered. The remaining surface sod in the unit was
carefully removed and the burial was lightly exposed to determine its extent and
position. The most superficial part of the skull was 23.75 cm below the present
ground surface.

This burial contained the nearly complete skeleton of a 2.5-3.5 year old
child. The body was flexed and lying on its right side (Figure 10). The burial was
oriented with the head pointing east. The skull had apparently sustained fractures
to the left temporal, left parietal, and right occipital areas (Albrecht, this volume,
did not note fractures, however). This was not apparently due to ground weight
compression as the skull retained its normal shape and form. The bones were
well preserved, especially when considering the young age of the child and the
shallow depth of the grave.
The fracture of the skull had displaced the position of the left temporomandibular joint, forcing the lower jaw forward and to the right. This position

forced the lower right lateral incisor into crossbite. The primary maxillary central
incisors had been lost postmortem. Both root sockets were intact, showing that
no root resorption had begun before the loss of these deciduous teeth. All but six
of the ribs were missing, and five of those were on the right side. The bones of
both hands were present, but the foot bones were missing. Due to the shallow
position of this grave it is probable that it was disturbed by animals shortly after
its placement.
Three roughly-finished arrowpoints of undetermined types were recovered
near the right knee of Burial 1 (Figure 11). The points are on flakes worked
only on the edge to outline their shape. Possibly made by the child, they may
represent the remains of a toy bow and arrows placed with the child at the time
of burial; these were the only possible funeral offerings found with this burial.
After the general extent and position of the burial had been determined, the
entire 1.5 x 1.5 m unit was uniformly deepened, leaving the burial in place on a
pedestal. When the excavation of the floor reached 48.75 cm bs, another burial
was found directly below Burial 1.

Burial 2
Although Burial 2 was positioned almost directly below Burial 1, there was
no intermixture of bones between the two (Figure 12). Both burials were confined to distinct burial pits separated by 10 to 12 cm of soil. Within this soil layer,

a large piece of clean charcoal was recovered that was the first one submitted for
dating (see below). It is likely that a part of Burial 2 was encountered during the
excavation of the pit for Burial 1, as there is some evidence of minor disturbance
of some bones (misplaced right humerus, left ulna, and fibulas).
Burial 2 was a 4.5-5.5 year old child. The sex could not be determined with
certainty due to the age at death. The body had been placed in a prone position
with the lower legs bent back toward the head. The toes of either foot were
turned toward the other, and the feet were above the pelvic bones (Figure 13).
This burial was also oriented to the east. Like the bones of the child above it, very
little bone deterioration was observed on most bones of Burial 2, the exceptions
being the ends of long bones, fibs, and pelvic bones. Generally, the remains are
in a good state of preservation, and the dissolution noted is not unexpected due to
the young age of the child.
Most of the fibs are present and in a normal anatomic relationship to the
spine, also present and intact. The bones of the left arm and hand are undisturbed,
except for the ulna, which had been moved from its original position. The left
hand was folded back behind the body, over the left hip and near the feet. The
distal end of the fight humerus was lying over the right lower inferior border of
the mandible, while the bones of the fight forearm were 28 cm away from their
normal articular surfaces with the humerus. The right radius and ulna were in
anatomic relationship to each other, as well as being in proper relation to the
bones of the fight hand.
The position of tile skull of Burial 2 was nearly face down. The cranial
bones had settled, and the entire skull was flattened antero-posteriorly. This
can be attributed to the ground weight on the incompletely ossified skull and/
or to damage that occurred during the excavation of the pit for Burial 1. The
maxillary anterior central incisors were both missing as a result of normal
deciduous exfoliation.

The burial of this child was accompanied by grave goods of unusual rarity
and beauty. Accompanied by a strand of small drilled disk beads was a doubledrilled, engraved gorget made of a marine whelk shell. Their position around
the neck of the child at the time of the burial implies that they were part of a
shell necklace. The gorget was carved to represent an effigy of a human hand
(Figure 14). During the process of excavating Unit A(-3) to allow for complete
exposure of Burial 2, a third skull was encountered in the unit’s north corner at
60 cm bs (see Figure 13).

Burial 3
Burial 3 was an adult male at least 55 years old. The body had been placed
in a supine position with the head turned to face the left shoulder. The knees were
slightly flexed and angled to the left. The left arm bones were lying across the
lower part of the abdominal area, but the bones of the left hand and the distal
sections of the left radius and ulna were missing (Figure 15). Some of the
missing skeletal parts were recovered during excavation of the surrounding soil
up to a meter away, suggesting rodent activity was responsible. The skull of this
skeleton is remarkably well preserved and shows advanced ossification of the
sutures; the other bones are exceptionally hard and well preserved, and on some
surface areas the ivory color of fresh bone has been retained.
The right ascending ramus and genial area of the mandible had been fractured. Instead of being a simple crack through the bone, the ramus fracture was
splintered halfway through. The zygomatic arch was cracked, and the appearance
of it and the ramus fractures are consistent with those that could have occurred at
or shortly after the time of death, although Albrecht (1994) considered the
fractures healed.
The teeth are badly worn from mechanical abrasion, and exhibit dental
decay. Wearing away of the dental enamel, and the softer dentin layer, exposed
the pulp on no less than 11 teeth, rendering them non-vital and subject to
periapical abscesses. The presence of a fistula scar on the right anterior maxilla
represents the final stages of an infectious process that took many years to form
after the associated tooth became non-vital. Evidence of two lost molars and
subsequent healing are present. The effects of moderate generalized periodontal
disease can be observed, and this is not unexpected in an individual of this age
where carbohydrates (corn) are present in the diet, and oral hygiene is nonexistent.
Three Olivella shell beads and four small drilled columella beads were
found with this burial. No arrowpoints or arrowpoint fragments were found in
proximity to the burial.
Shortly after discovering Burial 3, the tibia, fibula, and the distal end of the
femur of a very young child were exposed directly over and 20 cm above the
lower legs of Burial 3. Designated Burial 4, the position of this skeleton prevented the complete exposure of Burial 3 until a later date (see Figure 15, left).

The burials found up to this point had been encountered within the first 1.5
x 1.5 m unit. To complete the exposure of both burials 3 and 4, unit A-3 was
excavated (see Figure 9).

Burial 4
Burial 4 was a very young child approximately 1.5-2.5 years of age. The
long axis of the body was laying 10 degrees south of west and in a slightly flexed
position. Most of the bones were present but were quite fragile due to incomplete
ossification. The burial was undisturbed and was not associated with Burial 3. A
distinct and separate burial pit was observed above the lower legs of Burial 3.
The uppermost part of Burial 4 was 40 cm bs (see Figure 15, right).
As expected in the skeleton of a young child, the skull had settled from
ground pressure, but generally it was intact. Most of the maxillary teeth were
missing from other than natural causes, and they were not found during the initial
exposure of the burial. As in Burial 3 however, some complete deciduous teeth
were found in the soil surrounding Burial 4. Rodent activity is the most probable
cause of their displacement.
A large necklace consisting of 405 small (4 mm in diameter), drilled, shell
disk beads was found in situ around the neck of the remains of this child. The
shell used to make beads was marine in origin, but the type of shell has not been
determined; no other burial offerings were found with Burial 4.

Martin ~ The Dillard Site

Burial 5

Upon removing the uppermost layers of soil in the next unit, A-3, the fifth
burial was encountered lying alongside and 10-12 cm higher in elevation than
Burial 3. It was well separated from it (Figures 13 and 16).
Burial 5 contained the complete remains of an adult male about the same
age as Burial 3. Despite their proximity to each other, Burial 3 and Burial 5
appear to represent separate interments. No grave offerings of any kind were
found with this burial.
The skeleton of Burial 5 was flexed, oriented in a northeast direction, and
lying on its right side. The lower legs were bent tightly against the thighs. The
left arm bones were extended behind the body with the left hand positioned near
the buttocks. The right arm was extended in front of the body with the right
hand positioned between the thighs. The head was turned to the right, nearly
face-down. Most of the bones of this skeleton were exceptionally dense and hard
(Figure 17).
The dentition of Burial 5 was the worst encountered in any of the burials
found at the Dillard site. All of the molars on the maxilla had been lost except
one, the left first molar. This remaining molar was non-vital due to occlusal wear
into the pulp, causing the development of a periapical abscess. Advanced periodontal disease was also observed: The area in which the other maxillary molars had been lost antemortem showed evidence of chronic bone infection. This
was most likely due to the infection of residual root tips, preventing the bone
from healing completely. The remaining maxillary teeth were severely worn,
and their bone support was affected by moderate to severe periodontal disease.
This person had lost four teeth on the mandible while still living, with
subsequent healing occurring. Of the remaining 12 mandibular teeth, nine of
them had periapical abscesses either from decay or excessive wear. Based upon
the physical evidence of extensive dental disease, this person was in an unusual
amount of discomfort most of the time. The presence of dental caries in this
individual is characteristic of a diet high in carbohydrates that provides the
energy source for the growth of harmful bacteria (Morse 1978:40).
A very large post or small storage pit was found below Burial 5. It extended
1 m below the burial and was 25 to 36 cm in diameter.

Burial 6

Burial 6 was located in the northwest comer of Unit A-3. This burial seems
to have been disturbed prehistorically and reinterred because of the disarticulated
nature of the remains. Only a small part of this burial was located within this unit,
so the excavation was expanded in unit B-3 to expose it. The exposed burial
included only a radius, the second cervical vertebra, vertebral fragments, a skull
fragment, one scapula, two calcaneus bones, two ribs, and five teeth (see Figure
17). A large tubular bone bead was recovered among the bones. The burial was

Figure 17. Burial 5 (left) as it was found in Unit A-3, Block 3. The bones of the left hand

photographed, its position recorded, and it was then covered with dirt until
complete excavation and removal could be accomplished.
The excavation was now expanded on the southeast side nearer the point of
the terrace ridge. This was in keeping with the original excavation plan, which
would allow for the interim covering of the block with plywood and waterproof
taws. A shallow drainage ditch was dug around the excavation to channel off
heavy rainwater.
When unit B(-3) was staked out, a distinct depression in the ground was
noticed within the staked boundaries. This depression was about 75 cm wide and
15 cm deep. This had not been noticed before due to the tall grass, and the laying
of the plywood covers over this area when working in the block. On closer
inspection, three similar depressions were observed scattered across the point of
the terrace.

Burial 7
An unusual amount of hearthstones were immediately encountered during
the excavation of unit B(-3). In the area of the aforementioned depression, a solid
layer of large hearthstones was uncovered. These stones were placed closely
together with large amounts of charcoal and ashes interspersed between and

136

Texas Archeological Society

beneath them (Figure 18). The layer of hearthstones was about 15 cm beneath the
surface, and extended west into Unit A(-4). The large rocks exposed and removed during the excavation of the first unit of this block [A(-3)] were also
associated with this rock layer.
A scapula, clavicle, and proximal third of a humerus were uncovered 60
cm bs along the southwest wall of unit B(-3). The bones had been obviously
disturbed, and were that of a juvenile. The rest of the burial lay within the adjacent unit B(-4). Labeled Burial 7 (Burial 7A in Albrecht [1992, 1994]), the
bones were left in situ on a pedestal against the wall until Unit B(-4) could be
excavated.
A characteristic burial fill had been encountered from the rock layer to the
depth of Burial 7, and it was initially assumed that this soil was associated with
Burials 1, 2, and 7. However, mixed soil/burial fill continued below the level of
Burial 7, and it was concluded that another burial probably lay deeper in the unit,
and that Burial 7 had been previously disturbed by the digging of this subsequent, but yet unexplored grave. Unit B(-4) was excavated to expose the remainder of Burial 7.
Burial 7 was badly disturbed. The body had originally lain on its right side
with the left leg fully extended and the right one slightly flexed. The left leg
was complete, but only the lower part of the right leg remained. These bones
represented the only undisturbed part of this burial. It was discovered later that
the rest of the bones had been dislodged by prehistoric gravediggers, who had
attempted to pile the loose bones back into the area of the original grave after
digging a later one.
The burial was that of a child who died between the age of 6.5-7.5 years (see
Albrecht, this volume). The burial was too badly disturbed to offer any clue as to
the cause of death. The body had been originally oriented in an east-west direction with the head to the east. The skull, which had originally faced north, seems
to have been moved nearer to the pelvis, and was positioned facing south when
found (Figure 19). Other incidental bones (vertebrae, fingers, and ribs) had also
been piled on the feet and legs of this burial. The left one-third of the mandible
was found beneath the skull; the remaining two-thirds was missing. As with the
other burials, artifacts were found mixed in the burial fill, but they were not
considered intentional grave goods.

The Mass Burial (Burials 8-12)
Beginning about 75 cm bs, perforated Olivella shell beads were found in
Unit B(-3). These seem to have increased as the excavations neared the skeletons, and they were most abundant in and around the bones themselves.
When the excavation of Unit B(-3) reached 87.5 cm, the occipital portion of
an intact skull was encountered. Before the day was over, three other skulls had
been located in this grave. The bones of two arms, articulated at the elbows, were

found among the first two skullsl The next day, a fifth skull was discovered
(Figure 20). The burial pit bottom was reached immediately below this last skull,
at a depth of 1.35 m.
Cleating of the skulls revealed that five intact skeletons lay below them, but
only two of these skulls were positioned in a normal anatomic relationship to the
cervical spine. The others were well separated from the postcranial skeleton. The
skeletons consisted of three females and two males (Albrecht 1994:Table 1).
It should be mentioned at this point that the individual remains found in this
mass grave were labeled numerically in the order of appearance of their skulls.

138

Texas Archeological Society

Most of the other bones had settled within a 15-17.5 cm thick layer. Later, with
additional dirt removal and exposure of more skeletal details, the skeletons were
matched with the displaced skulls (Figure 21). The displaced skulls were matched
to their respective skeletons by using the laws of deduction, observation of the
undisturbed anatomic positions of the bones, and by identifying the sex of each
skull and pelvis.
This detailed cleaning of the remaining dirt from the bones revealed evidence suggesting the perimortem decapitation of some of the five people.~ Cervical vertebrae were found dislodged or missing. The skulls of three of the bodies
had been displaced from 25 to 55 cm, and as much as 57 cm higher up in the
burial fill from their respective postcranial counterparts, while most of the
smaller, more easily disturbed bones, still remained in their proper anatomic
positions (Figures 22-23).
Burial 8
The first two skulls discovered were labeled Burials 8 and 9. They were
positioned high in the burial, 79 and 89 cm bs, respectively, and 48 and 58 cm
from the floor of the gravepit. The disarticulated arms found associated with
these skulls belonged to Burial 8, a 16-20 year old female lying extended on the
north side of the mass grave (see Figure 21). Hers was the most disturbed of all
the bodies, with only the torso and legs remaining intact, and she was positioned
on the left side against the northwest wall of the gravepit. The fact that both the
left and right arms were found articulated high in the burial fill suggests
perimortem disturbance, rather than postmortem movement of the bones by
animal or human disturbance. The mandible from this body was never found.
Most of the digits of a dismembered hand thought to belong to this burial were
found below the right femur of Burial 11. Around 40 Olivella shell beads were
found scattered among the ribs and legs of Burial 8. There were no other offerings identified with this burial.

Burial 9
The displaced skull farthest from its respective skeleton was Burial 9.
This skull was the second one encountered after the discovery of the mass
grave, and its placement was the highest of any of the remains within the
grave pit, but the skeleton was found in a prone position below Burials 8, 10,
and 11. The mandible was intact and laying 25 cm away near the skull of

Albrecht’ s (1994) examination of Burials 8-12 did not uncover clear perimortem evidence
of decapitation, but a few skeletons of Plains Village age have been found in the Southern
Plains with evidence of traumatic death, including decapitation (Brooks 1994b; Bovee
and Owsley 1994).

Burial 8 (see Figure 21). The arms were extended below the body. The most
superior part of the skull was 57.5 cm above the floor of the burial pit, and
it was lying on top of the arm bones of Burial 8 (see Figure 22).
The appearance of skull 9, with its prominent brow ridges, supraorbital
foramina, and heavy jaw structure, was decidedly male. Positive proof of the
correct matching of this skull to the remaining headless skeleton came when
the pelvis was removed and definitely confirmed to be that of a male. The
estimated age at the time of death is between 30 and 34 years.

By measuring the remains in situ with the skull replaced in its approximate
normal position, the height of this person was estimated to be around 1.6 m.
The teeth that remained were in fair condition, and exhibited moderate wear;
several had been avulsed at or after the time of death. Olivella beads were
discovered among the bones of the upper torso, and conch beads were found
near the feet.

Burial 10
The apparently intact skeleton, Burial 10, was that of a young male 27 to 34
years old. He appears to have been in perfect health with a complete and healthy
dentition. Except for the aforementioned displaced body parts (the two arms and

skulls of Burials 8 and 9), he was lying extended on the right side above all of the
other bodies, with the superior part of the skull at 107 cm bs. The cause of death
of this man is not evident from examination of the remains (Albrecht 1994). The
skeleton appears to be complete, and unlike the four other skeletons placed
below this one, all of the bones are in their proper positions. He was slightly
larger in stature than the other male from this grave, with his height estimated to
have been around 1.65 m. Two conch beads were found near the pelvis of this
individual, and five were found near the feet (see Figure 23).

Burial 11
The skeletal remains of Burial 11, a female, were lying in a prone position
atop Burials 8 and 9, but below that of Burial 10. The remains were 20 cm above
the floor of the grave and 118 cm bs. The right leg was slightly extended with
the knee bent.
Hundreds of Olivella shell beads were recovered near the neck and chest
area of the skeleton, and the skull was displaced forward. The mandible was
still in its normal position with the spine, while the cranial portion of the skull
lay 30 cm away. This woman was small in stature, about 1.53 m tall, and from
17-21 years of age when she died. The arms were extended at her sides, and a
bracelet containing 43 more Olivella beads was found around the bones of the
left wrist. The missing part of the mandible from Burial 7 was found near the
skull of Burial 11.

Burial 12
Burial 12 was that of a 35-44 year old female. Hers was the first body to be
placed within the mass grave. Her burial posture was drastically different from
the others placed around and above her, in that she was buried face down in a
fully flexed position. The knees were drawn up to the shoulders, and the bones of
the arms were at her sides with the hands under the chest (see Figure 21).
Although she appeared to have been decapitated, the head had been placed next
to the body, and very close to what would have been a normal anatomic position,
although it had tipped forward during the subsequent placement or settling of the
other bodies. The weight of the ground had flattened the skeletal remains (excepting the skull), and most were only 5 to 7.5 cm above the floor of the burial
pit. The exact amount of separation of the skull from the cervical spine could not
be measured because the first four cervical vertebrae were missing, and the
remaining three may have been fractured. Blackened encrustations preserved on
the skull of Burial 12 are very similar to those observed on the skulls of Burials
8-9, and 11.
Between the feet of the individuals in the mass grave was found an unusual lump of greenish-yellow clay, 5 x 7.5 cm in size. It resembles very closely

Martin ~ The Dillard Site

145

the size and color of clay nodules occasionally found in Caddoan graves excavated in East Texas and Arkansas. This may have been a burial practice adopted
by contact with the people from this area. It was noticed that smaller particles
of this clay, caught in the screen during washing, produced a bright green paint
when wet. Iron oxide-bearing ochre stones were also found close enough to the
bones to be considered possible burial offerings.
An occasional small drilled columella bead was found in the mass grave.
Fourteen were recovered scattered in the grave fill, and in association with the
upper torso of Burials 9 and 11. Larger columella beads were found around the
feet and legs of the five individuals, and in the surrounding grave fill. Twentyeight of these were eventually found there, suggesting they were attached to
anklets, the leather ties on footwear, or for decoration of the same.

Burial 13
The scattered bones of a child between 3.5-4.5 years of age were discovered while deepening the excavation of Unit B(-4). The bones were within a 60
cm area, which was 75 cm bs, and 50 cm southwest of the undisturbed leg of
Burial 7 (see Figure 19). The bones were extremely small, but were well preserved, as were all of the other bones discovered at this site, As one might expect, no intact skull of this child was found, but several large, extremely thin
fragments were recovered. The bones were not in normal anatomic relationship
to each other, and they had been disturbed after the body had decomposed. This
disturbance could have taken place during the digging of the grave for Burial 7,
or during subsequent digging of a hole to deposit refuse. Rodent or other animal burrowing may also account for this disturbance.
The unusual preservation of the skeletal material was quite evident as each
burial was discovered and excavated. When some of the skulls were cleaned
and examined, even the tiny ossicles of the middle ear were found in perfect
condition.

SUMMARY OF THE MASS GRAVE
When the damp earth was being dusted from the surface of the bones of
the mass burial, they were coated with what appeared to be a thin layer of ashes.
Upon seeing this, the first impression was that these people had been partially
burned before their burial. However, there were no remnants of charred material associated with this ash coating, and the bones were of a uniform color and
density when brushed off. This gray-white powder may represent the byproducts
of a reaction of the decaying organic remains with minerals contained in the
soil (Morse 1978).
The facial areas of the skulls had an intermittent black encrustation that did
not firmly adhere to the bone. Many teeth, either loose or still in their sockets,

146

Texas Archeological Society

had blackened root surfaces. These areas do more closely resemble charred
remains. If these discolorations are a result of actual burning, it was not done to
the point that the bone itself was charred. When the black crusty material is
removed, the bone retains the same appearance as the surrounding unblackened
areas. Whether this also represents some sort of reaction with the soil, or is
evidence of burning prior to burial, requires further analysis. Neither the white
ash-like coating, or blackened encrustations, appeared on any of the bones representing single interments.
The reason these five people died at the same time and were buried together
is open to speculation. The most obvious observation to be made concerning this
mass burial has to do with the possible mutilation by dismemberment and decapitation of most of the bodies. The positions of two skulls and two arms at such
distances away from the postcrania suggest this, but visual examination of the
remains showed no cut marks or other positive evidence of perimortem injury
(Albrecht 1992, 1994).
If murder and mutilation were involved in the deaths of these people, it
may be presumed to have been the result of actions by a group of marauding
hostiles during a raid. If it can be assumed that the individuals interred in the
mass burial did not die of natural causes, their burial postures suggest they were
buried very soon following their deaths. The missing second, third, and fourth
cervical vertebrae of three of the skeletons may explain why cut marks were
not evident on the skulls if decapitation occurred through the neck. Evidence
for perimortem decapitation is seen in other Late Prehistoric Plains Village
burials (e.g., Brooks 1994b), and is rarely found in Caddoan cemeteries in the
Great Bend area of Red River (as at the Crenshaw Site (3MI6) in Miller County,
Arkansas [Durham and Davis 1975]). Other instances of this type of mutilation
has been reported from Henrietta Focus sites (Krieger 1946; Lorrain 1969).
The absence of grave offerings such as pottery vessels and fine chert weapons and tools is characteristic of Plains Village burials. What is not characteristic is the presence at Dillard of so many marine shell beads with the mass
grave. The positions of many of these beads suggests that they were in strands
when the bodies were buried. At least three strands were identified in situ around
the headless body of Burial 11. Around the left wrist of this body was a bracelet of Olivella beads. Other beads were not only found intimately associated with
the skeletons, but were scattered within the burial fill, as if they had been thrown
in as the bodies were being covered. Rodent activity probably accounts for some
scattered beads being recovered beyond the perimeter of the burial. The only
other items found in this grave that can possibly be identified as burial offerings were the ochre stones, a bone hairpin, and the lump of green clay. Although
accidental occurrence of these items in the burial fill is possible, they were recovered intimately associated in the same layer with the bones.
The tragedy surrounding the death and subsequent burial of these five
people was likely a very important and well-remembered event in the community. Whether their deaths were a result of a raid on the village proper, or upon

Martin m The Dillard Site

147

a small group at an outlying camp away from the protection of the village, the
incident was immediately known and the burial quickly accomplished. Since the
bodies were carefully positioned within a small amount of space, with one in a
fully flexed position, their burial may have taken place within a few hours of
their deaths, before rigor mortis had occurred.
After the skeletal remains in Block 3 had been fully exposed, professional
archeologists from several Texas universities and the Texas Historical Commission were invited to examine the remains in situ. Alternative ideas and different
interpretations were discussed concerning the various burials and their possible
causes of death. The confinement of the burials to such a small area is consistent with the burial patterns at the Harrell site (Figure 24). Intrusions by later
burials at the Harrell site were common, and three mass burials were discovered. In these mass burials, skulls were missing and mandibles were either disarticulated or missing (Krieger 1946). They were all restricted to a small area in
the center of what Krieger refered to as "the brow of the terrace," interpreted to
mean an outward projection of the terrace itself.
After examination by the professional archeologists, and all pertinent measurements and photographs had been taken, the burials were removed and the
bones individually wrapped and cataloged. They were transported to the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, where complete osteological analysis, including DNA recovery and sequencing, is being directed
by Dr. Doug Owsley (see Albrecht 1992, 1994).

ADDITIONAL WORK IN BLOCK 3
Nine and one-half additional units were excavated in Block 3 (see Figure
9) after uncovering the mass grave. For the most part, these units were adjacent
to those in which the burials were confined, and were excavated to further
define the extent of the cemetery area. The sterile soil below the occupation
zone in the remainder of Block 3 was encountered in most places from 91-106
cm bs.
No additional intact burials were discovered in these adjacent units, but
some bones from the burials already discovered, and possibly from still undiscovered burials, were recovered (Albrecht 1992, 1994); four large columella
beads were associated with them. A total of 176 additional human bones and
teeth were recovered from these adjacent units. These bones had been transported from intact burial remains by rodent tunneling. Most of the bones were
digits and teeth, but patellas, vertebrae, skull fragments, and rib fragments were
also recovered. Many of these displayed rodent gnawing.
In the east corner of Unit C(-3), a dark soil stain mixed with charcoal,
hearthstones, shell, clay, and bone fragments was noted. This continued through
the sterile layer in the remainder of the unit (at 86 cm), and resembled burial
fill. Further excavations in adjacent units C(-2) and D(-2) indicated that this

feature was a large storage pit measuring 1.37 x 1.52 m in diameter and 2.28
m deep. The storage pit was filled with the same types of cultural debris found
elsewhere in the midden deposits of Block 3. The bottom third of the pit had
been undercut, resembling the bell-shaped pits found at other Late Prehistoric

Plains Village sites on the Southern Plains (Figure 25). A charcoal sample
suitable for dating was recovered from the 203 cm level of this pit (see below).

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS AND QUANTIFICATIONS
The discussion of the artifacts found at the Dillard site is divided into five
main groups: chipped stone, ground stone, ceramic, shell, and bone. This includes

150

Texas Archeological Society

consideration of the suspected provenance of the raw materials from which the
artifacts have been made.
The artifact classifications and descriptions of the artifacts recovered at
Dillard are based on information from three primary sources: (a) the identification of stone artifacts was based upon Turner and Hester (1985); (b) the bone
tools and shell artifacts mainly from Bell (1980); and ceramic identifications
from Suhm and Jelks (1962).

CHIPPED STONE TOOLS
The most common stone tool type at the Dillard site is the projectile point
(N=101) (Tables 1-3). With one exception, all of the projectile points are
arrowpoints; a Gary dart point was found at 188 cm bs in the storage pit in Block
3. The different age ranges of the recovered points suggest that this site was
probably occupied by prehistoric groups from the Late Prehistoric I through the
Late Prehistoric II periods (see Prikryl 1990). Dart points are infrequently found
in deposits from Late Prehistoric I period sites on the Southern Plains. The
absence of underlying Archaic deposits permits a clearer understanding of the
associated tool assemblage for these periods.
The most common arrowpoint type is the Washita point (N=41) (Turner and
Hester 1985). Many of these Washita points are of a serrated style (Figure 26)
that is relatively common at sites on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River near Lake
Lewisville (Daniel J. Prikryl, personal communication 1993). The Washita points
averaged 1.9 cm in length and 1.25 cm in width.
The lithic materials used in the manufacture of the points originated from
sources over a wide geographical area. Most of the artifacts were made of highquality chert, but coarser-grained local quartzites or silicified sandstones,
commonly called sugar quartz, were also used. Identifiable raw materials include
green chert of the Reeds Spring Formation and novaculite from the Ouachita
Mountains of western Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma, Edwards Plateau
chert, Alibates, Ogallala quartzite, agatized wood, and obsidian (Banks 1990).
The most common source of obsidian in this area is from Obsidian Ridge in
northern New Mexico (Hughes 1989:194).
The Fresno (N=26) was the next most prevalent point type (Turner and
Hester 1985). This type was more common in the later part of the site’s occupation, and technically they are generally crudely made compared to other
arrowpoint forms. The Fresno points average 2 cm in length, while their width
was 1.35 cm. The lithic types utilized for Fresno points were predominantly local
quartzites and coarse-grained cherts.
The remaining arrowpoint types found were divided between the Bonham
(N=5) and Scallorn (N=9) types, with one Agee, one Cliffton, and 11 unidentified examples also present (Turner and Hester 1985). The Scallorn and Bonham
points typically occur in Late Prehistoric I period occupations, and/or the early

part of the Late Prehistoric II period. Agee points are rarely found this far west,
and are most commonty found in the Great Bend area of the Red River near
present day Texarkana.
Other stone artifacts recovered from the Dillard site included bifaces,
uniface endscrapers, uniface sidescrapers, gravers, drills and spokeshaves
(notches) (see Tables 1, 2, and 4). A utilized flake of quartz crystal was also
found. These chipped stone tools are commonly found in prehistoric Plains
Village sites on the Southern Plains. The appearance of wood and bone working tools (e.g., the uniface, graver, abrader, and notch) evidences bow and arrow and bone tool manufacture on this site. This type of assemblage would be
expected in a village whose occupants relied heavily upon hunting not only for
their own immediate sustenance, but for stockpiling a surplus to get them
through lean times.
Flakes of lithic debris recovered from Block 1 totaled 1352 pieces, and
these were mainly from deeper strata in units J-1 and K-1. Many of the projectile
points recovered from this block also came from unit J- 1 (see Table l). Two bone

pressure flakers were also found in this unit, suggesting that this part of the block
was probably a work area at one time. The presence of many complete,
apparently, usable artifacts is most likely the result of simple loss.
The artifact assemblage from Block 2 was very similar to that of Block
1, in that the predominant point type is the Washita, and there were few other
tools besides arrowpoints (Table 2). Fresno, Scallorn, and Bonham arrowpoints
comprise the remaining projectile point types recovered from Block 2 (Figure
27).

Figure 27. Chipped stone artifacts from Block 2 (see Table 2 for more information).

Because burials in Block 3 were placed in a dense midden, it was difficult to
distinguish between artifacts placed with the burials and those that had been
accidentally lost or thrown away. Cultural debris that had been deposited on the
surface of the refuse heap, ended up deposited deep in the ground as burial fill
when the graves were backfilled. Subsequent disturbance by rodent activity
scattered some items further.
The numbers of chipped stone artifacts was much higher in Block 3 than
in blocks 1 and 2 (Table 3). This artifact increase is probably related to the

154

quantities of midden in Block 3, as more items were deposited. In other words,
the items recovered from Block 3 were both accidentally dropped here during
periods of intense occupation, but sometimes brought to this area of the site to
be thrown away.

Figure 29. Projectile points from Block 3 (see Table 3 for more information).

Although many projectile points and tools were found in the area of the
burials in Block 3, only three arrowpoints have been identified as burial offerings (see Figure 11). The rest were deposited or lost in the area, and some were
interred in deeper deposits during excavation for trash dumping or burial placement. Since most of the points were broken, and generally recovered in shallower deposits than the human remains, it is unlikely that they were intentionally
placed there as burial offerings. No projectile points were found in a context as
to suggest that they were the cause of death of any of the individuals. When
projectile points are found as grave goods in a burial, a common custom among

Caddoan groups, they are usually in a cluster (probably a quiver) placed near
the body. The only instance in which this occurred was with Burial 1, where
three arrowpoints were found together near the knees.
Except for the Agee point, all of the stone artifacts recovered from the
Dillard site are consistent with those from other Late Prehistoric Plains Village sites in North Central Texas and South Central Oklahoma (Krieger 1946;
Lorrain 1969; Brooks et al. 1985). The frequency of the Washita type at this
site is perhaps more common than at other Late Prehistoric sites in this area,
but may simply be related to an increased intensity of hunting during the
period when they were made. The different styles of points found at the site
were produced at different periods by different artisans to comply with favored methods of mounting and lashing the point to the arrow shaft. The
differences in size and shape of points of the same type probably had very
little association with its intended use, but were more likely dictated by the
size and workability of the stone blank. All would bring down a deer, bison,
or man equally as well.
Almost all of the other chipped stone artifacts from the Dillard Site consisted of various tools used for working bone, shell, wood, and animal hides, or
for food preparation (Figures 30 and 31). These types of tools were relatively
common in each block (23-38 percent) (Table 4).
Simple, unworked flakes, freshly struck, were also used for miscellaneous
tasks, attested to by the many small flakes along the tool edges that were evident under magnification. Uniface endscrapers and sidescrapers may have been
for working either hides or wood. Bifaces were used for woodwork and food
preparation. Wood was one of the most abundant natural resources available to
the Native Americans, and they clearly took advantage of this resource. Stone
tools from Dillard suggests the manufacture of several different wooden items
that could have been produced by using these tools: the most obvious of these
are arrow shafts and their bow counterparts.

These artifacts were made primarily of native stone and produced by
means other than percussion flaking (Table 5). Examples from the Dillard
site included milling stones (metates) and the manos that were used to mill
and process domestic and wild plants. Alhough no intact milling stones were
recovered, the eight fragments found were thin and flat, and were made from
dark sandstone and silicified sandstone. Eighteen whole or fragmented manos
were found in all blocks, but were particularly common in Block 3. These

also were made of either sandstone or silicified sandstone. Other examples of
milling stones were found at nearby Late Prehistoric satellite encampments.
Other artifacts in this category include sandstone and limestone abraders,
used for smoothing wood, bone, or shell. One was made from a fossilized portion
of mammoth or mastodon tusk, the remains of which are commonly found in the
Fish Creek valley.
Cretaceous concretions containing cores of red or yellow ochre hematite
were used as sources of pigment. They have also been mentioned as being one of
many ritually significant burial offerings placed in Mississippian period graves
(Spencer and Jennings 1965:76). Most of the examples were battered open and
scraped with abrading stones to obtain the pigment. Although these were found
in all of the blocks excavated, they were most numerous in the area of the burials;
some were also present as burial offerings.
One fragment of a celt, made from an unidentified black stone, was found in
Block 3. The ground surface is very flat and highly polished.
Large amounts of lithic debitage and fire-cracked hearthstones were recovered in the three blocks, with about 70-80 percent of these remains found in
Block 3. The frequency of lithic debitage and burned hearthstones is presented
by unit in Table 6.

CERAMIC ARTIFACTS
The ceramics from the Dillard site include small amounts of trade ware as
well as locally manufactured wares. Most of the locally made ware has been
identified as Nocona Plain, characterized by an abundant shell temper that was
usually leached out, leaving a pitted and porous surface (Suhm and Jelks 1962).
Also present in significant quantities were sherds similar in appearance to that of
Nocona Plain, but with a temper made up of crushed limestone. The color and
softness of these limestone fragments lead one to think that the source of the
temper came from the abundant crumbling hearthstones that had deteriorated
from the heat of cooking fires. In some examples, mixtures of both mussel shell
and burned limestone were used as the tempering medium.
The exterior surfaces of the Nocona Plain type sherds vary in color from
medium brown to dark gray. The interior surfaces are consistently darker, and
sometimes a black carbonaceous deposit appears on the inner surface. There is
no incising, engraving, applique, or any other type of decoration present on
Nocona Plain. The surfaces are fairly smooth, but are not well polished. Many
pits (from the leaching of the shell) can be observed on the surface of those
sherds tempered only with mussel shell, while those samples tempered with both
shell and limestone (or limestone only) have a smoother, less porous surface.
The thickness of the sherds ranges from 4 to 9 mm, with an average thickness
of 7 mm.
Several sherds of a cord-marked pottery were identified, principally from

Block 3 (Table 7). The exterior surfaces of these sherds are buff in color and are
decorated with many linear cord incisions and impressions having been pressed
or stamped into the surfaces of the soft clay. The cordmarking generally runs in
one direction on the vessel, but sometimes the pattern is quite random (Figure
32b). The sherd wall thickness of the cord-marked pottery ranged between 8-11
ram. The temper is grit and pulverized bone. The texture is coarse, but not
crumbly. The cores are uniformly dark gray.
Of the total ceramic sample (N=759), 45 percent are Nocona Plain with
shell temper. Over 30 percent of the total is Nocona Plain with shell and limestone temper, while 19.4 percent is tempered with just limestone. Nocona Plain
rim sherds represent 3.4 percent of the total, and cord-marked pottery 1.4 percent. Five sherds from ceramic pipes from blocks 2 and 3 were also recovered
(see Table 7).

The cord-marked sherds are all from the body of globular jars. The other
physical traits such as general thickness, temper, color, and surface treatment, fit
the description of Lindsay Cordmarked. This is a typical ware found in Plains
Village sites in South Central Oklahoma (Brooks 1994a:44), particularly the
Washita River phase. The cord-marked sherds also have similarities to Borger
Cordmarked, an Antelope Creek phase type. The time frame in which Borger
Cordmarked was produced ranges from about A.D. 1100 to A.D. 1500 (Hughes
and Hughes-Jones 1987:22). Cord-marked tradeware also appears in other Late
Prehistoric sites on the Great Plains and Woodland areas of the United States and
Canada (Suhm and Jelks 1962:15).
The method used to manufacture Nocona Plain type ceramics involved
coil construction followed by hand-shaping and smoothing. Some specimens
with rougher surfaces were possibly made using the paddle and anvil method.
Sometimes a slip was applied. Although no complete or near complete vessels were recovered, enough sherds were retrieved to identify the sizes and

shapes of two vessel forms of Nocona Plain with three different rim forms
(Figure 33).
One vessel form is a cooking pot or storage jar with vertical sides and a
rounded globular body. Orifice diameters are estimated at about 37.5 cm, and
complete vessels could have had 3 to 5 liter capacities depending upon their
depth (see Figure 32c).
The other vessel form identified is a small bowl with a depth of about 6.5
cm and a width of 14 cm (see Figure 32d). A sizeable section of one bowl was
found in the Unit B(-3) fill above the mass burial, but the placement is not
believed to be intentional.
Complete vessels of Nocona Plain pottery are practically unknown, but one
unbroken specimen of apparent trade ware was found in Titus County, Texas
(Suhm and Jelks 1962:115). Pottery was not included as burial offerings in the
areas where Nocona Plain was made, and subsequently, few examples have
survived.
One other sherd of tradeware recovered was a rim section of a Caddoan
water bottle. The exterior and interior surfaces are chocolate brown in color,
and the exterior surface has been polished. In cross section, the core is bluishgray, changing to an oxidized bright red just beneath the outer surface. The
piece is 2 x 3 cm in size and comprises about one-sixth the circumference of
the rim. The thickness of the wall is 3.5 mm. Fine grained sand is the only
inclusion visible in the paste. There is no decoration on the rim, but based
upon similar descriptions, Wilder or Taylor Engraved bottles are possibilities
(Suhm and Jelks 1962).
Besides pottery sherds, pipe sherds were also found at the Dillard site (two
sherds from Block 2 and three from Block 3). Two fragments were pipe bowls,
and the others were sections of the stem (14 mm in diameter) and stem/bowl
junction (Figure 34). The ceramic pipe fragments were very hard and dense. The
color is black on broken surfaces with evidently small amounts of shell temper
showing on one sherd. A buff-colored slip had been applied to the surface.

Martin ~ The Dillard Site

Figure 34. Ceramic pipe sherds.

In general, the pipe fragments do not resemble the pottery assumed to be
locally made (Nocona Plain). Rather, the style is that of a type known as the Red
River pipe (Bell 1980:99), although shell temper is usually not used with the Red
River pipe. These types of Red River pipes were made from ca. A.D. 800-1400,
and those from Dillard resemble later varieties (after ca. A.D. 1200).

SHELL ARTIFACTS
The shell artifacts from the Dillard site fall into two primary categories:
local mussel shells of freshwater origin and land snails of the Rabdotus genus,
and altered marine shells obtained through trade. None of the snail shells had
been altered for utilitarian or decorative use. Although the occurrence of mussel
shells and Rabdotus snail was frequent throughout the excavations, no lenses of
either were noted.
Two different species of mussels were harvested from the creeks and Red
River near the Dillard site. Both types were altered and utilized as digging tools;
a hole was perforated near the center of the shell to facilitate hafting onto a
handle. The unhafted shells may also have been used as gravedigging tools.
Their use as hide scrapers is also possible, but this cannot be proven due to
excessive deterioration of the edges.
Two complete halted mussel shell hoes, and three fragments, were recovered in the Block 3 cemetery (Figure 35). Also, twelve unaltered exampJes
showing evidence of wear were found. Many more shell fragments were found in
the blocks (Block 1 = 25; Block 2 =11; Block 3 = 349) to indicate the degree to
which they were harvested for food.
The discovery of 991 marine shell beads, and an engraved marine shell
gorget in effigy of a human hand, evidences regular contact with Eastern cultures
where these types of ornaments are commonly found. All of the marine shell
artifacts recovered occurred as burial offerings or were part of the attire of those

buried (Table 8). The likely origin of the identifiable shell types was in the
waters around Florida, on both the Atlantic and Gulf sides. Artifacts of engraved
shell appear in Mississippian period sites throughout the southeastern U.S. as far
north as the Crable site in Illinois, and as far west as the Sanders and Valley Mills
sites in Texas (Phillips and Brown 1978:xi). Shell beads have been found at other
Late Prehistoric sites across eastern Texas and Oklahoma, and have been reported as far west as the Plains Village Edwards site in Beckham County,
Oklahoma (Gilbert 1980:72).
The symbol of the hand has been linked to the "Southern Ceremonial
Complex" (SECC) or "Southern Cult," terms that have been used to describe a
common group of design elements and suspected religious practices prevalent
throughout the Southeast during the Late Prehistoric period (Phillips and Brown
1978:169). It is uncertain if the hand gorget from the Dillard site represents a
SECC artifact or association. This piece (Figure 36) does resemble four gorgets
removed from the Craig Mound at the Spiro site, and other Southeastern ceremonial centers, but the motif lacks the eye symbol engraved on the palm as often
occurs when associated with SECC burials (Hamilton 1952:206-208).
No refuse fragments of marine shell have been identified in the excavation
debris from Dillard; indicating that the shell artifacts were not likely manufactured at the site. The presence of artifacts of marine origin supposedly associated with the SECC may merely represent the trade of such goods (originating
somewhere in the Southeast), the motifs being the paraphenalia of Southeastern
ceremonialism, instead of evidence suggesting the adoption of Southeastern
religious practices on the Southern Plains.
The shell artifacts discovered at Dillard were probably traded in their
finished state (cf. Brain 1988). The presence of bison hair textiles and robes
from the Craig Mound at Spiro is suggestive that bison products among
Mississippian groups may have been obtained by trading with Plains cultures
(Hamilton 1952:265). Without regard to the original significance of the gorget,
its presence does suggest that the people at the Dillard site did have contact
with, and did carry on trade with, other contemporary societies from the
Southeast.
The raw materials used for some of the marine shell artifacts discovered at
Dillard were from two different shell species. These were a species of the
Olivella genus, native to the southern Atlantic and Gulf coastal waters, and a
species of the whelk shell, probably Busycon perversum, native to the southern
Florida coast (Phillips and Brown 1978:27).
There are only two places along the Gulf of Mexico from which the shell
for this artifact would have come. It came either from the western Gulf, near
present Vera Cruz, Mexico, or from the eastern Gulf on the coast of Florida
(Brain 1988). The total lack of evidence of the Mesoamerican connection lends
more credence to a Florida-based trade network (Spencer and Jennings 1965:73).
The workmanship and attention to detail involved in the production of the
gorget is excellent, and this is practically unknown for items from North Central

Texas. Because of the geographical area in which this necklace was found, it is
an important archeological find, but one should not discount the fact that it is
also a beautiful example of prehistoric Native American art.
The piece was probably obtained in its finished form via a trade route up
the Red River. Other engraved marine shell gorgets have been found in the Red
River Valley in previous years, but none have been found as far west as Dillard.
Since 1911, only 15 engraved shell gorgets, and 19 plain and engraved cups,
have been reported from various Caddo sites along the Red River, ranging from
the Belcher site in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, up river to the Sanders site in Lamar
County, Texas (Phillips and Brown 1978:163-168).
The edges of the gorget are all rounded and well finished. On the convex
surface are engraved abstract designs of unknown meaning or significance (see
Figure 36). The dimensions of this piece are 5.5 x 7.5 cm. The average size of
the 68 small drilled beads found accompanying the gorget was 1 x 5 mm.
The four different types of shell beads found with the burials at the Dillard
site were small drilled disk beads, small drilled columella beads, larger columella
beads, and beads made from the whole Olivella shell (Figures 37, 38). The disk
beads were made from small fragments of drilled shell that were strung and wetsanded on sandstone to round the edges. The columella beads were made from
drilled sections of central spiral of a whelk shell (Figure 39).
The utilitarian nature of most objects that are placed in prehistoric graves
usually is sufficiently straightforward to offer clues as to their intended use by
the deceased in the afterlife. Such an intended specific use for the marine shell
ornaments for the deceased can only be determined by learning about the social
and religious importance these objects represented to the people while they were

living. While their presence in the burials may indicate nothing more than the
simple act of burying property belonging to the deceased, the fact that exotic
Gulf coast shell artifacts were included is connotative of the social position of
some of the individuals at Dillard.
The importance the inhabitants of the Dillard site placed upon the possession of these beads is evident by the abundance of them when compared to
contemporary burials from this area. This practice of including such items
with human burials can be found among Caddoan groups throughout eastern
Texas and Oklahoma, but has been found only infrequently to be associated
with Late Prehistoric burials on the Southern Plains (Brooks et al. 1985:61;
Brooks 1994a).

BONE ARTIFACTS
Two primary categories of bone artifacts, faunal remains and worked bone,
will be discussed. Worked bones are those faunal remains that have been
intentionally modified for tool use or ornamentation. Faunal remains comprise

the broken and unbroken animal bones from the byproducts of butchering and
processing animals for food.
Soil conditions, and the depth at which most of the bone artifacts from the
Dillard site were recovered, together created almost an ideal environment for the
preservation of bone. This was particularly true of the worked bone. Worked
bone is usually hard cortical bone which has been shaped, sanded, or polished.
Bone artifacts from Dillard are still quite durable, and most resemble fresh ivory
in their appearance and hardness.
The non-worked faunal remains (n=5241) were divided into three categories: deer bones (N=661), bison bones (N=146), and bones from other
animals (Table 9). Deer bones were about 4-5 times as prevalent as bison
bones. The deer remains were either from very young or very old deer. The
preservation of non-worked bone fragments is less remarkable, but is still
much better than is commonly seen in North Central Texas. The pits and
fissures present in broken bone fragments probably allowed for greater moisture and plant root penetration, resulting in more decalcification from dissolved acids than that found on a smooth, polished surface (Klein and
Cruz-Uribe 1984:7). Fat or oil was possibly rubbed into a bone tool’s worked
surfaces to enhance its flexibility.
Expert identification of a representative example of other faunal remains
revealed a variety of animals used for food (Table 10). These remains were
scattered over the different excavation areas, but were concentrated in the midden
areas of Block 3.

Manufactured bone artifacts at this site were not abundant (N=33), but a
representative sample was recovered to illustrate the various types of bone tools
used by Plains Villagers during the Late Prehistoric period. The most common
bone artifact recovered was the bone awl. Four complete specimens (mean length
= 9.4 cm) and eight broken fragments were found (Table 11). One had an
unusually hard and sharpened point (Figure 40b). These tools were most likely
used to perforate hides in preparation for sewing into bags or garments. They
also could have been used in the manufacture of baskets or matting (Bell
1980:61). Three of the awls from Dillard retained the joint end of the bone as a
handle (Figure 40b-d), while all of the others were made from split sections of
bone (Figure 40a, e-m).
A bone hairpin or fastener of clothing was recovered from the mass burial
near the waist area, and between the skeletal remains of burials 8 and 9. It was
9.5 cm in length, and has been chipped and ground to shape, but was damaged by
rodent gnawing. It is blunted on both ends, and undecorated (Figure 41a).
Three flaking tools, used in the production of stone projectile points and
other tools, were found in association with an unusually large amount of lithic
debris in Block 1. All three of these flaking tools had been made from deer ulnae.
One had a long working point, while the other two had been shortened for more
power and control (Figure 41b-d). Six fragments of deer antler were also found,
and these were probably used for the same purpose (Figure 41e-j).
Three deer jaw sickles were recovered during the excavations, two of which
were recovered intact in Block 2 (Figure 42a, b). These tools were used mainly
for cutting grass, cane, and reeds to be used in basket weaving, matting, or house
thatching. They could also have been used for harvesting both wild and domestic
crops, as well as for shelling kernels of corn from the cobs. On each specimen the
condyle had been removed from the mandible to simplify the fastening of a short
handle to the ramus. The deer jaw sickle is commonly found in Plains Village

and Texas (Bell 1980:71).
The production of fishhooks at Dillard provides some insight on the importance of fish in the Plains Village diet on the Red River. Fish could occasionally
be obtained by capturing them in shallow pools, but the manufacture of handline
tackle to catch them suggests that they were regular food items on the menu. The
unfinished fishhook blank found intact at the Dillard site measured 11 x 33 mm
with a 4.5 x 10 mm hole cut toward one end (Figure 43a). This artifact is
extremely well preserved. The other fishhook fragment was found in the storage
pit in Block 3.

Two bone beads were recovered during the excavations in Block 3. One was
made from a bird leg or wing bone, measuring 5 x 13 mm in size. The other one
(7 x 37 mm in size), associated with the disturbed Burial 6, was made from a
small mammal leg bone (Figure 43e-f).
The use of the most unusual bone artifact has not been determined. It was
cut from a section of flattened bone (2 mm in thickness) into a square shape
roughly 10 x 10 mm. Into two opposing sides were cut two deep notches, 2.5 x
2.5 mm each. One face of the artifact has been scored several times with a stone
tool (Figure 43d). My hypothesis is that it was used as a fastener, much like a
button. A thong or sinew could be tied tightly around the "button," being held in
place by the notches, with the knot against one of the flat sides. This in turn could

be tied onto clothing by passing the two ends through two holes and tying them
from the reverse side.
A small, round disk of bone was found in Block 3. Less than a cm in
diameter, it had been sanded and shaped on all surfaces. Its intended use is
unknown (Figure 43c).
A flattened section of cancellous bone from a bison femur is identified
as a hide grainer (Figure 44a). Fashioned from the end of the bone, the flat
spongy surface was used like an abrader to smooth the surface of hides that
were being prepared for bedding or clothing (Bell 1980). The artifact measured 56 x 65 x 37 mm. These bone tools have been found on protohistoric
Wichita sites in Oklahoma.
A digging tip made from the ulna of a bison was found in Block 2. Marks on
the tool as a result of hafting show that it was fastened to a handle and used like a
shovel (Figure 44b). Bison tibia digging tips are common artifacts in Plains
Village sites, especially in the Washita River phase (Bell 1980:75).

EVIDENCE OF COPPER

A fragment of human cranium recovered from Unit A(-4) was stained a
bright blue color. This stain permeated the entire bone fragment (8 x 10 x 2 mm
in size). It was suspected that this staining resulted from the presence of metallic
copper, perhaps in the form of a bead, some of which had corroded on or near the
surface of the bone fragment. As the original source of the suspected copper was
not recovered or had corroded away, a simple chemical test was devised to
confirm the presence of the copper ion.
Metallic copper oxidizes in the soil through corrosion. The resulting anhydrous copper sulfate is colorless, but in the presence of moisture changes to the
characteristic blue color of the pentahydrate, represented by the following chemical equations:
Cu2 + H2SO4 = CuSO4 + H2
CuSO4 + 5H20 = CuSO4.5H20
colorless

blue

When the pentahydrate is dissolved in water, the cupric ion actually has the
formula [Cu(H20)412. If excess chloride ions (from HC1 or other very soluble
chlorides) are dissolved in the solution, the color becomes green. The green color
is attributed to an equilibrium mixture of blue and yellow ions, represented by
the equation:
[Cu(H20)412 + 4C1 = [CUC1412 + 4H20

blue

yellow

When the bone sample was tested under controlled conditions, the presence of
copper ions was confirmed (Kennan and Wood 1966:517).
It is not a total surprise to find evidence of copper use in North Central
Texas during this period. The availability of the metal at large prehistoric
Caddoan trading centers, where other trade materials from Dillard probably
originated, substantiates this.

MATERIAL ASSOCIATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
The perception that the Dillard site was continuously occupied for several
hundred years has a direct bearing upon the manner in which artifacts and
remains were deposited. Although cultural debris was present throughout the
occupation zone, it was most abundant in levels 2-3: lithic debris, pottery sherds,
and broken animal bones were all consistently more numerous in these layers.

Burned and broken hearthstones were also more plentiful in levels 2-3, except in
the center of the cemetery area where many large stones were concentrated near
the surface.
Fresno arrow points are found generally in more recent deposits at the site,
along with Washitgt points, and these points are diagnostic of the Late Prehistoric
II period. Scallorn, Bonham, and Gary dart points are diagnostic of the Late
Prehistoric I period. Thus, the arrowpoint distributions suggest the multi-component nature of the site.
The average thickness of the occupational deposits was 66 cm (Figures 45
and 46). This is unusually deep when compared to the the nearby Chickenhouse
site and other Late Prehistoric sites in the area (Lorrain 1969). This evidence,
coupled with the recovery of projectile points made over several hundred years,
suggests that the site may have been consistently occupied for many generations
(Figure 47). Profile layers displayed no sterile lenses or changes in soil color
within the occupied zone. The only soil color changes noted were post molds,
darker areas where ashes and charcoal were concentrated, and small intrusive
areas of lighter soil introduced by burrowing rodents.
Many ochre stones of two primary colors were recovered throughout the
excavation of the site, but they were most numerous in the areas of the burials.
The stones originated in the Cretaceous formation of the Trinity and Woodbine
Sands in which gas pockets from organic decay formed. These voids became
filled with a soft brick red or yellow ochre hematite that can be scraped or ground
into a powdered pigment. Ochre is found in abundance in both the Eastern and
Western Cross Timbers of Cooke and Montague counties. The prevalence of
these stones at this site suggests common use either for personal adornment
(body painting), or for the coloring of pottery or clothing.
With the exception of Burial 1, there were no arrowpoints found directly
associated with this or any of the other burials in the cemetery. The artifacts
thought to be burial furniture, either as part of the person’s attire or placed in a
ceremonial context, included all of the marine shell beads (at least four necklaces and one bracelet), the shell gorget, ochre stones, a lump of green clay, the
three roughly made arrowpoints, two bone beads, and a bone hairpin.

CHRONOLOGY AND RADIOCARBON DATES
Since the excavation of the Dillard Site was undertaken as a personally
funded project, only two radiocarbon samples have been analyzed from the
several collected samples. More samples will be analyzed as finances permit. In
an attempt to obtain the most reliable results, the largest and cleanest of the
samples collected were submitted to the University of Texas Radiocarbon Laboratory for analysis.
The samples tested were both charcoal, primarily still in lump form, and
they were not affected by root contamination. Sample A came from a 13 cm

layer of soil separating Burial 1 and Burial 2 in Block 3, Unit A(-3). Burial 1
was directly above Burial 2. This position rules out disturbance or intrusion as
a cause for the origin of the sample, and definitely associates the sample with at
least one of the burials at the site. The sample was collected at 55 cm bs.
Sample B was recovered near the bottom of the large storage pit, 213.4 cm
bs, in Units C(-2) and D(-2), Block 3. The age of this sample should help
determine the time of pit abandonment and document the beginning of its use as
a trash depository.
The isotope corrected date obtained for Sample A was 680 + 110 years B.P.
(Tx-6179), and Sample B was 622 + 58 years B.P. (Tx-8022). These correspond
well with my estimates of the age of the samples (A.D. 1150-1350) when they
were submitted for analysis.
These dates were further analyzed by using a radiocarbon calibration computer program to make probability predictions of the ranges of occupation
(Stuiver and Reimer 1993). The program calculates minimum and maximum age
ranges (Method A), and their probability distributions (Method B) for the calibrated radiocarbon dates (Table !2).
Taking Sample B as an example, the values found by Method B can be
interpreted as follows. With a one-sigma error range, 85 percent of the area under
the probability distribution is within the combined age range Cal. A.D. 13001370 (or 85 percent of the error curve for one sigma). With a two-sigma error
range of 95.4 percent, 100 percent of the area is within the age range A.D. 12901420 (Stuiver and Reimer 1993).

SUMMARY
The occupation of the Dillard Site occurred continuously over a period of
350 to 400 years, beginning around A.D. 1100. This encompasses part of both
the Late Prehistoric I and Late Prehistoric II periods (Prikryl 1990). Prehistoric
phases that existed during this time on the Southern Plains and western edges
of the woodlands include: Sanders, Spiro, Haley, Henrietta, Frankston, Titus,
Antelope Creek, Custer, Optima, and Washita River (Brooks et al. 1985; Brooks
1994a).
The prolonged occupation of the Dillard site, but the limited amount of
work conducted there, prohibits estimating what the population was at any given
period, but it may have been greater during the deposition of levels 2 and 3 since

Martin -- The DiUard Site

they contain the highest artifact densities. The longevity of the site as a
permanent village may be attributed to its favorable location. Another village
site with surface finds of artifacts comparable in age has recently been discovered in a field south of, and directly across, Fish Creek from the Dillard site.
It is concentrated on a large terrace 665 to 675 feet in elevation, and extends
south from the prehistoric mouth of the creek. It is conceivable that at times
both terraces were occupied simultaneously as part of one village; thus the
village population at the time of occupation could be much larger than originally
thought.
Because of the geographic position of the Dillard site, and the site artifact
assemblage, it is not considered a "classic" Henrietta Focus site. The origin of
the Late Prehistoric inhabitants of North Central Texas, and of the Henrietta
Focus, has never been firmly established, nor has a core area been described in
which its distinctive cultural characteristics may have developed. The area encompassing the Henrietta Focus might best be described then as part of a cultural
"buffer zone" between the wooded east and the prairie west. The cultural materials found at Dillard display some characteristics of both traditions.
The boundaries of this buffer zone extend from around Wichita Falls,
Texas, in the west, to Bonham, Texas in the east, and from Denton, Texas to the
south, northward to about Ardmore, Oklahoma; that is, the middle Red River
Valley and areas 50-70 km either side of it, and the upper tributaries of the
Trinity and Brazos rivers (Krieger 1946:87). Different villages within this area
seemingly adopted many characteristics of neighboring cultures, dependent upon
their geographic location. Those villages located in the eastern part of the zone
display more eastern traits, while the opposite is true of those villages located on
the plains further west (Wyckoff 1970:104). Subtle regional differences in artifact assemblages from these sites can be observed when collections from eastern
and western Plains Village sites are compared (Brooks 1994a).
One example of this regional variability is the difference in the styles and
numbers of milling stones found on Late Prehistoric Plains Village sites in North
Central Texas. Those examples found on eastern sites are smaller and shallower
than the more massive and deeper ones found on contemporary sites 60-80 km
west of Dillard (Krieger 1946:108). Milling stones are less numerous on eastern
sites when compared to those in the west, where hundreds of broken and complete examples have been observed scattered on site surfaces. One unrecorded
site in Montague County also has dozens of milling holes pecked into the large
stationary boulders at the edge of a bluff. A comparative decrease in the numbers
of milling stones in the area of the Dillard site, can best be explained by a change
to wooden mortars and pestles for processing grain. This change from stone to
wooden implements was an idea that spread from the east and perhaps did not
become well established in the western areas (Vehik 1989).
Another discernible difference at the Dillard site is related to the geographical terrain. This part of the Red River valley provided the populace with more
available deer than bison to hunt. The forested hills and isolated valleys were not

190

Texas Archeological Society

favorable terrain for large gregarious groups of bison, although their numbers
had increased on the Southern Plains during the Late Prehistoric period. The
large percentage of deer bones as compared to bison remains recovered from all
levels of the Dillard site substantiates this. The tendency to rely more heavily on
deer populations for meat is a characteristic of the more easterly situated Plains
Village groups, who were agriculturally oriented while those to the west relied
more strongly on bison (Brooks 1994a:43).
Another dissimilarity is with the types of lithic trade materials found on
eastern Henrietta Focus sites with those from sites further west. Many eastern
sites, particularly those around Lake Texoma, are dominated by lithics from
eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas (Albert 1984). Lithic material originating at
sources in West and Southwest Texas occurs most often on Late Prehistoric sites
located west of western Cooke County. Geographical location would logically
dictate this since the cherts, chalcedony, and jasper occasionally found at most of
these sites originated as cobbles washed down from the western drainages into
the Red River.
There are no ceremonial or burial mound complexes on the Red River west
of the Caddoan Harling Site (41FN1) in Fannin County, Texas (Davis 1970:4255). Temple and burial mounds are associated with the more important religious
and social centers of the Caddo, but not all Caddoan groups built both temple or
burial mounds. It makes sense that prosperous villages like the Dillard site,
located on the western fringe of the moundbuilding areas and well outside the
main sphere of Caddoan influence, would not have started this practice, even
after some period of contact and interaction. Less affluence and more difficult
en,cironmental conditions would not easily allow a frontier society the wherewithal to invest energy in ceremonial activities such as mound building. Also,
ceremonial mound centers are traditionally located in areas where mound building and associated religious practices evolved over a period of centuries (Albert
1984:15-17). Nevertheless, the absence of mounds at Late Prehistoric sites in
North Central Texas does not preclude the possibility of the inhabitants possessing similar religious ceremonies and basic beliefs as those practiced in Caddoan
societies (Albert 1984:15). Influential Late Prehistoric villages like Dillard are
identifiable archeologically, as are non-moundbuilding Caddoan centers.
Given these observations, it is believed that the people of the Dillard site,
and other nearby villages identified with the Henrietta Focus, were the progeny
of the original Late Archaic inhabitants of North Central Texas. Contact with
their surrounding neighbors, and their own adaptations, resulted in the development of sedentary villages, horticultural economies, and, to a lesser extent, bison
hunting as a means to increase food production. This contact and influence
increased as the dependence upon the eastern cultural centers became less important to those Caddoans living on the western frontier, and contacts with Plains
inhabitants became more frequent. Thus, Plains Village groups in the eastern part
of North Central Texas were different from more northern and western Plains
Village farmers.

One of the original goals of the investigation concerned the amount of
social contact and interaction that occurred with neighboring villages, such as the
Chickenhouse site. Corrected dates from Chickenhouse (A.D. 1080, 1160, 1270,
and 1430) indicate that occupations at both sites were largely contemporaneous.
The artifacts from Chickenhouse are quite similar to those from Dillard in style
and frequency: bone awls, fishhook debitage, whetstones, abraders, retouched
flakes, scrapers, worked bison bones, knives, drills and bone beads. A variety of
lithics were identified at both sites with non-local Edwards chert, quartz crystal,
Alibates dolomite, and obsidian represented. Milling stones and manos were not
abundant from either site. Cache pits, post molds, and hearths were much the
same at both sites. The few clay pipe fragments from the two sites were nearly
identical in size, material, and color, and were of a style and craftsmanship of
Caddoan design (Bell 1980:98).
The only controlled excavation of a burial from Chickenhouse was of a
middle-aged female buried in a semi-flexed position. The skull, left hand, and
left wrist was missing and appeared to have been lacking these body parts when
buried. The mandible was present. Two other burials were located by a dragline
removing gravel after the excavations had terminated, but the bones were removed and given away before examination (Lorrain 1969). This one burial,
however, shares with many of the Dillard site burials the fact that they also were
missing some of their body parts.
The pottery from Chickenhouse was nearly all Nocona Plain. The rim forms
were the same as most of those at Dillard, with large cooking vessels common
at both sites. The thickness, temper, and method of manufacture were alike, but
the body shapes of the vessels from Chickenhouse are more globular or ollashaped. Some vessels from this site have massive flattened bases; no bases were
found at the Dillard site. A few sherds of cord-marked ceramics were recovered
at both sites. Limestone was sometimes used as temper in the pottery samples
from both sites.
The types of projectile points differ at the two sites. Most notable is the
greater percentage of Scallorn points, and the Eddy arrowpoint type, at
Chickenhouse. Illustrated examples of the Eddy type appear to be a variety of the
Alba type (Turner and Hester 1985). Several dart points were also found at
Chickenhouse, and these together with the Scallorn and Eddy types, suggest that
this site’s occupation began before that of the Dillard site, where only one
contracting stem dart point was found.
Based upon the comparison of the artifacts and radiocarbon dates, it can
be reasonably assumed that the two sites were partly contemporaneous. Owing to the proximity of the sites, there was probably some contact between the
two neighboring Late Prehistoric villages in the Fish Creek Valley. The relationship of the prehistoric villages with other neighboring settlements would
not likely have been competitive or hostile, but raids by hostile groups probably did occur, particularly during times of drought when food supplies were
decreased over wide areas.

192

No artifacts of marine shell were found during the Chickenhouse excavations, this being the only other major difference between the artifact assemblages
of the two sites. Those from Dillard were found associated only with burials
dating to the Late Prehistoric II period. The burial from Chickenhouse did not
contain beads and other grave goods, but six bone beads were recovered during
excavations elsewhere on the site (Lorrain 1969).
There is an abundance and variety of other trade items found at the Dillard
site. Those obtained through eastern trade networks were probably channeled
through locations near the Great Bend of the Red River and the middle Arkansas
River, where lithic materials, pottery vessels, and marine shell ornaments were
amassed at commercial centers like Spiro and Sanders (Schambach 1993). Sites
like Dillard had greater access to trade goods from the east because of their
proximity to the Red River. After exchanges were made at key trading points
along the river, a wider dispersal of the trade goods was probably achieved
through local barter with widely dispersed groups.
The Dillard site existed at a time when trade and commerce was at its height
between Southeastern cultures. The large numbers of marine shell artifacts found
at several civic-ceremonial sites suggests that beads, beaded clothing, and other
shell items were important symbols of trade and exchange during this period
(Kopper 1986:167). It is very possible that occupants of the Dillard site acted as
intermediaries between traders traveling by river and groups living away from
navigable streams. Its strategic location at the junction of Fish Creek and Red
River, and the imposing view of the village itself, would provide an easily
recognizable landmark for unfamiliar travelers going upriver in dugout canoes.
Probable trade materials at Dillard include stone, shell, pottery, and copper.
The lithics identified in the debris included quartz crystal, novaculite, Zipper
chert, and Bigfork chert from the Ouachita Mountains of Southeast Oklahoma,
and both Keokuk and Reed Springs varieties of Boone chert from the Western
Ozarks (Banks 1990; Albert 1984:73-75). Lithics from west or southwestern
sources include Edwards chert from Central Texas, black translucent obsidian,
probably from New Mexico, and Alibates dolomite from near Amarillo on the
Canadian River; Alibates is also found in river gravels downstream from the
quarries. Other items were copper from the Great Lakes area, marine shell beads
and a gorget of whelk shell from the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, and cord-marked
pottery from possibly the Washita River or Antelope Creek phases. The farranging extent of such a trade network is impressive, even in modern times, and
emphasizes the generally accepted notion that Henrietta Focus peoples, and other
Plains Village cultures, had adequate contacts and opportunities to obtain imported items and raw materials.
The suspected building outline of a structure in Block 2 of the Dillard site
is similar to those described at Chickenhouse: the floor areas were circular or
ovoid in shape and moderately sized, being approximately 6 to 6.5 m in diameter (Lorrain 1969). The outer framework of the structures at both sites was
supported by an inner framework made of three or four large posts, 15 to 18 cm

Martin -- The Dillard Site

193

in diameter. Smaller post molds along the perimeter of the structures provided
the foundation for thatching, and thus the structures would have resembled the
~,o ,,1 ,,la~V11,~ ,, ,u,,lu,~ ~,~,ut,~ kO,~l~O ¯ :,,,, j. ,_,e,~ut l,ltu,,~,t posts may represent support poles for bedding frames and storage racks. Beginning at the
bottom, bundles of cut cane or grass were vertically tied to this framework construction and were lashed in tiers until the entire house was thatched (Newcomb
and Campbell 1982:34). These were very durable dwellings of surprising longevity. A 1956 reproduction of a similar dwelling at Indian City near Anadarko,
Oklahoma, is still in good repair. Many structures were erected at the Dillard
site, as evidenced by the numerous post molds exposed in the blocks. The most
intense areas of house construction were concentrated on the highest parts of
the terrace. Garden plots and outdoor work arbors probably surrounded the central living areas where the houses were located.
Milling stones, agricultural tools, and the remains of charred corncobs are
conclusive evidence for the practice of maize agriculture at this site. Other crops
were probably grown, such as beans, squash, sunflowers, or tobacco, but flotation analysis is needed to confirm this. Other plant food resources included
walnuts, pecans, hickory nuts, and chestnuts; no acorns were found despite the
thousands of oak trees of varying species in the surrounding forests. Wild edible
or medicinal plants were probably also brought back to the village and tended to
in the garden plots. However, foraging was still an important food source,
particularly in the springtime when domestic surpluses were near depletion and
the field crops were not ready for harvest.
Snares or nets were likely employed to capture small game animals and
fowl, while the bow and arrow was reserved for the larger game. The bow and
arrow is the predominate weapon to be positively identified as having been made
and used at the Dillard site. The main projectile point type was the Washita,
many a serrated variety. Also common was the Fresno type, and this point was
generally recovered from the upper midden deposits.
The burials at the Dillard site were confined to a very small area on the
southern point of the terrace, nearest the junction of the creek with Red River.
This area contained deep midden deposits overlaying two abandoned storage
pits. The storage pits eventually fell into disuse, and were filled with trash either before or about the same time as the burial interments. This area continued
to be subsequently used as both a refuse dump and cemetery. So much refuse
continued to be deposited here that the whole terrace point became elevated 3060 cm higher than adjacent village areas. It was here, many years after the initial occupation of the site, that the last burials were placed in the highest
elevation of the refuse heap.
The absence in the Henrietta Focus burials of pottery vessels and weapons as grave goods is significantly different from contemporary Caddoan
phases further east (Perttula 1992). Although marine shell artifacts are often
found in Caddoan burials, they are rarely seen in Plains Village burials. In
almost all instances at the Dillard site, they were the primary burial offerings.

194

Texas Archeological Society

These objects either represented great wealth and importance to the survivors
(important enough to lavish upon the dead), or the beads and ornaments were
the possessions of the deceased. The in situ positions of most of the beads
indicates they were worn as necklaces, anklets, and bracelets. The widespread
dispersal of many of the Olivella beads suggests that some of them may have
been sewn on to garments for decoration, but rodent disturbances may also
account for this.
Personal adornment with exotic jewelry was a popular custom and probably a sign of social status among the inhabitants of the Dillard site. Almost 70
percent of the burials were adorned with some sort of bead ornamentation. The
ages of those buried with such finery ranged from 2 to 60 years. The sex of the
individuals apparently had no bearing on who wore the bead necklaces, but
beads that appear to have been sewn to the clothing were found only on or near
the remains of two women.
The body positions of the interments at Dillard were flexed, partially
flexed, or extended, with the heads directed generally to the east or northeast.
Most Caddoan burials are extended, but flexed and semiflexed burials also
rarely occur (Turner 1978). The direction bodies are buried is not uniform
among most burials on the Southern Plains, but most are placed in a flexed or
semi-flexed position.
Two of the intact skulls from the Dillard site had fracture injuries confined
to the facial areas, resulting in avulsed teeth, with associated fractures of the
maxilla, mandible, and cranium. No cut marks were observed on the surfaces of
the skulls in the areas of this trauma. Some additional fracturing may have
occurred many years postmortem because of ground settling and movement.
Besides the possible dismemberment of four of the five individuals in the mass
burial, their skulls have blackened encrusted areas on the surfaces as if they had
been partially burned or scorched. This may be related to the ectocranial porosis
present on most of the skulls. Some burials had other missing body parts (such
as a mandible and humerus) and they were removed without leaving any
recognizable cut marks on the connecting bones.

CONCLUSION
The topographic location of the Dillard site fits the ideal prerequisites for
a site existing during Late Prehistoric I and II periods: near a source of fresh
water; a major, navigable stream was nearby; and the immediately surrounding
terrain was heavily wooded. It is also situated above the normal floodplain on
the second river terrace, and the soil is a fine, sandy loam that is fertile, drains
well, and is easily tilled (cf. Albert 1984:132-133).
Certain archeological evidence from the Dillard site is suggestive of interaction with Caddoan groups. This includes maize agriculture, sedentary lifestyle,
items obtained by trade from Mississippian cultures, housing that was similar

Martin m The Dillard Site

t95

to Caddoan construction, and Caddoan style tobacco pipes. Similar cultural traits
are shared with the nearby Washita River phase, namely: maize agriculture,
comparable arrowpoint assemblages, Nocona Plain and Lindsay Cord-marked
pottery, sites situated on river terraces, more deer remains than bison, as well as
the appearance of trade goods from both the Caddoan Area and from areas to
the west and southwest (Kawecki and Wyckoff 1984; Brooks et al. 1985).
The archeological record from the Dillard site does resemble the Washita
River phase more than any Caddoan tradition phase, but major differences are
noted. Pipes from the Washita River phase are usually stone elbow pipes, a
typical Plains Village style, and the houses instead of being circular in floor plan
are rectangular (Brooks et al. 1985:18). No burial goods were found with
Washita River phase burials, as is generally true of the Henrietta Focus and other
Late Prehistoric burials on the Southern Plains.
The location of the Dillard Site in the riparian forests of the Red River, in
reality, a western extension of the Eastern Cross Timbers, was an area geographically more suited to eastern than western cultural adaptations. The more
abundant food resources in the area of the site led to the adoption of a more
sedentary lifestyle, and its proximity to the river afforded the inhabitants easy
access to traders from the east, and first chance at the available goods.
It is hoped that additional investigations of Late Prehistoric sites of North
Central Texas and South Central Oklahoma will recover more evidence revealing the extent of Caddoan interaction in this area, and what effects this had on
the lifestyles of indigenous occupants. Periodic contact with far-ranging traders
may have helped to spread ideas as well as material goods, suggesting that other
Plains Village sites may have had stronger ties with contemporary eastern groups
than was once believed.

ABSTRACT
The skeletons of at least 12 individuals were excavated from the Dillard Site
(41CO174), a Plains Village site in North Central Texas. Seven individuals
were found in single interments, and five individuals were tbund in one mass
grave. Osteological analysis of these skeletons was undertaken to obtain demographic, bone, and dental pathology information for inclusion in a larger
data base being compiled by Dr. Douglas W. Owsley of the Smithsonian
Institution that encompasses the entire Great Plains area. A second objective
was to examine the osteological evidence for cause of death, with emphasis on
the mass burial of five individuals. The initial archeological assessment that
the mass burial represented a funerary rite of mutiliation and decapitation of
four Of the five people buried in the mass grave could not be confirmed by this
analysis.

INTRODUCTION

The Dillard Site (41 CO 174) is a Late Prehistoric Plains Village occupation
discovered, surveyed, and partially excavated by Dr. Ernest R. Martin in the mid1980s (see Martin, this volume, for a description of the site excavations, burial
context, and associated artifacts). Seven skeletons were found in individual
graves at the site. These included five children and two adult males. Of the seven,
five individuals were buried in partially or fully flexed positions. One was
extended, and one was fragmentary and scattered such that the origina! burial
position could not be determined.
Some of the interments had been disturbed before the present excavation.
Martin (this volume) attributed the displacement of some of the bones of Burial 2
to the later excavation of the pit for Burial 1. Likewise, the badly disturbed Burial
7A seems to have been encountered prehistorically during the digging of a later
grave (Burial 7B).
Five individuals were interred in a common grave. Two dissociated skulls,
from Burials 8 and 9, were initially found, along with some arm bones, seemingly separate from other skeletal material. Soon three more skulls were found in
rapid succession. These, too, gave the impression of isolation from postcrania.
Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 62 (1994for 1991)

202

Five relatively intact skeletons were found below the five skulls. The

apparent separation of the skulls from postcranial skeletons, the presence of
avulsed teeth and facial fractures that were perceived to be perimortem (at the
time of death), and the shifting of bony elements(including missing cervical
vertebra), as well as the multiple interment, suggested a catastrophic event that
involved death and mutilation (decapitation) (Martin 1994). Four of the skeletons were fully extended and one, the deepest, was tightly flexed. The bones
were found within a 15-17.5 cm thick layer. This dense commingling and
shifting of skeletal material over the past 600-800 hundred years made the
excavation complex and difficult. Martin (1994) reported only one skull, Burial
10, to be in normal anatomical relationship to the cervical spine.

OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY
Other Late Prehistoric village sites along the Red River contemporaneous with this site are known to have produced mixed sex burials of decapitated skulls. Some of these have been interpreted as ritual burials of trophy
skulls taken in warfare (Powell 1977), or as evidence of domestic funerary
rites. The principal objectives of the osteological analysis of Dillard site skeletons were to determine age and sex, to inventory bones and teeth present (and
missing), and to identify, document, and record dental and bone pathology for
inclusion in the Great Plains data base (see Owsley and Jantz 1989, 1994).
Additionally, an effort was made to identify cuts on bones (particularly on
cervical vertebrae and the base of the skull), to identify evidence of blunt force
perimortem trauma, and to identify dental and bony pathological conditions.
Determination of when and why teeth were lost was important to confirm or
deny the possibility of perimortem loss due to trauma. The presence of cuts,
perimortem trauma, or other signs of mutilation would be strong positive
evidence supporting the hypothesis of ritual, violent death for four of the five
individuals found in the mass burial. Absence of this evidence leaves the cause
of the death and reason for mass burial of these individuals open to further
speculation.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Criteria used for sex determination of the skeletons included skull, mandible and pelvic morphology, and long bone size and robustness. In general,
male skulls possess larger, more rugged mastoid processes, supra-orbital ridges,
and muscular attachment sites such as the nuchal notch on the occipital bone.
Male mandibles are larger and heavier, they have square chins, and the gonial
angle is typically obtuse. Females have sharper supra-orbital margins; their

Albrecht ~ Dillard Site Osteological Analysis

203

vaults are smaller, and more gracile than those of the male. The chin tends to
be more rounded with a point at the midline (Bass 1987).
The female pelvis is wider and more shallow than the male. The female
innominate has a wide, shallow sciatic notch, a long pubic bone, a ventral arc
on the pubic bone, a wide subpubic angle and concavity, a preauricular sulcus,
and an elevated auricular surface. The male sciatic notch is deep and narrow, as
is the pelvis as a whole. It is heavier and larger than the female pelvis. The pelvis
is the most reliable indicator of sex (Bass 1987; Ubelaker 1978).
Long bones are not as reliable as sex indicators but still contribute to the
confirmation of an opinion. Male bones tend to be larger and more robust than
female bones. Maximum diameters of the head of the femur and the humerus
are larger in the male.
Dental development and eruption were the criteria used to make age determinations of the children when possible. Radiographs of the maxilla and
mandible allowed accurate assessment of the stages of root development. The
dental development stages for four of the five children in the sample are given
in Table 1.
Long bone length and cranial vault suture closure were used when the
dentition was not recovered. Closure and obliteration of long bone epiphyses,
long bone length, dental attrition, cranial suture closure, palatal suture obliteration, spinal osteophytosis, other degenerative disease processes, and pubic symphysis and the sacroiliac auricular surface changes were used as criteria for aging
adult skeletons (Bass 1987; Mann et al. 1987; Moorrees et al. 1963a, 1963b;
McKern and Stewart 1957; Stewart 1979; Suchey et al. 1986).
Scoring of dental pathology included evaluation of the eruption status of
teeth, the existence of enamel defects and hypoplasia, tooth loss and alveolar
resorption, alveolar bone trauma (fracture), dental attrition (wear), pulp exposures, the existence and extent of caries, abscesses, and antemortem tooth loss.
Bone pathology scoring included bone response to infections, wear, trauma, and
nutritional distress such as ectocranial porosity, periostitis, cribra orbitalia,
osteoarthritis, eburnations (polishing of bone due to wear against bone), remodeling, and healing of antemortem fractures.
Radiographs of the left femur and tibia were taken if possible; the right
was substituted when the left was unavailable or unsuitable. Skull, maxilla, and
mandible radiographs were taken as well. Trauma and pathology were documented radiographically and photographically.

OSTEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF BURIALS
Table 2 summarizes the results of the osteological analysis. A detailed
discussion of each burial follows, beginning with the single burials (see Martin
1994 for additional details).

SINGLE BURIALS
Burial 1 - Unit A
This is the skeleton of a 2.5-3.5 year old. Missing were the hyoid, sternum,
left scapula, left clavicle, right innominate, sacrum, coccyx, both patellae, tali
and calcanei, 10 left ribs and seven right ribs. Extrasutural bones were noted in
the lambdoidal suture.
The deciduous dentition was present and mostly complete with only the
maxillary central incisors having been lost postmortem. Both the maxilla and
the mandible were present, and dental radiographs allowed comfortable assessment of the age of this child.
No sex determination could be made because of the child’s young age.
Slight cribra orbitalia, ectocranial porosis, and enamel hypoplasia of the left
mandibular canine indicate some nutritional deficiency. No antemortem or
perimortem trauma was evident.
Burial 2 - Unit A
This skeleton of a 4.5-5.5 year old was mostly complete. The right palatine,
hyoid, sternum, coccyx, both patellae, right fibula, 1 lth and 12th right ribs,
and third, fourth, and fifth lumbar vertebrae were missing.
Enough deciduous dentition was present to allow for age estimation, even
though there was some postmortem tooth loss. All four permanent first molars
were partially erupted, but none of the second molars had begun eruption.
Interproximal root caries was noted on five deciduous teeth. The deciduous teeth showed fairly heavy attrition. No trauma or pathology other than the
dental caries was present.
No estimate of sex was attempted due to the skeleton’s age.
Burial 3 - Unit A
This well-preserved male skeleton was judged to be 55-59 years of age
at death. Most bones were present, and only the hyoid, manubrium, coccyx,
both patellae, and first cervical vertebra were missing.
Age was determined by visual examination of the pelvis, long bones, and
skull. The cranial vault sutures were partially obliterated. Dental attrition was
severe and extensive. All epiphyses were closed. The ribs showed significant
sternal end cupping, macroporosity was evident in the auricular area of the
ilium, and thinning of the iliac was also noted. The condition of the pubic
symphysis would suggest a younger age, but the overall condition of the
skeleton is clearly that of an older individual (Suchey et al. 1986).
The skull was rugged, with clearly defined supraorbital ridges and muscle
marking. Bone size and ruggedness, pelvis, skull, and mandibular morphology
were all consistent with that of an older adult male.

208

Texas Archeological Society

Most permanent teeth were present. The maxillary third molar was lost
antemortem and showed alveolar bone resorption. The maxillary left lateral
incisor and right mandibular central incisor were lost postmortem. The remaining
teeth were worn; five were without enamel. Three teeth showed carious lesions
with more than one half of the crown surface destroyed. Nine teeth had alveolar
abscesses, eight with pulp chamber exposure due to attrition. The left maxillary
third molar had an enamel pearl.
The temporomandibular joints had been affected by osteophytes, porosity,
and erosion. The vertebral column and right acetabulum, left scapula, left and
fight humeri, left radius, left ulna, left femur, left and fight tibiae, and both
calcanei displayed mild osteophytic pathology with some joint surface porosity.
The right scapula, right clavicle, and four fibs showed evidence of old
healed fractures. The scapula and three ribs developed pseudoarthroses (healing
without union), and the remaining fib healed normally. The nasal bone and left
maxilla also displayed healed fractures. Rodent gnawing was seen on the fight
humerus and ulna. No evidence of perimortem trauma was found.

Burial 4 - Unit A
This skeleton is that of a child estimated to be between 1.5 and 2.5 years
old. The presence of the complete skull and mandible facilitated aging by allowing examination of tooth calcification and eruption. The hyoid, sternum, both
scapulae, both innominates, the sacrum, coccyx, both patellae, and calcanei are
missing, as well as one right fib, the seventh, 1 lth, and 12th cervical vertebrae.
The right and left maxillary deciduous central and lateral incisors had been
lost after death. All four deciduous second molars were unerupted as were the
permanent first molars.
No sex determination was possible on this young child. No evidence of
pathology or trauma was evident.

Burial 5 - Unit A
This is the virtually complete skeleton of a male estimated to be over 60
years of age. Only the hyoid and coccyx bones are missing.
This male’s age was determined by visual examination of the skull, long
bones, vertebra, and pelvis. All epiphyses are closed and obliterated. The
ectocranial and endocranial vault sutures are closed with only traces of the
coronal and sagittal sutures in evidence. The basilar synchondrosis is closed.
There is thinning of the right parietal bone, which affirms an age estimate of over
60 years (Kerley 1970). Marginal lipping, macroporosity, and increased irregularity of the auricular area of the ilium are also seen.
The large, heavy skull has a well developed nuchal crest, heavy large
mastoid processes, pronounced supraorbital ridges, and blunt supraorbital

Albrecht ~ Dillard Site Osteological Analysis

209

margins. The mandible has a squared symphysis and wide ascending rami. These
features are all consistent with male morphology. The pelvis shows classic male
features. It is large, narrow, and deep, and has a very narrow sciatic notch. The
pubic bones did not survive, but other morphology is convincingly male.
Both parietals, the frontal, and the occipital bones are affected with
ectocranial porosis. Vertebral lipping (osteophytes) is widespread, with the greatest involvement of the lower cervical vertebra (C4-C7) and lower thoracic (T9)
inferiorly through the lumbars and the sacrum. There is periostitis on the visceral
side of one left rib. The weight of the femur is very light, suggesting this
individual suffered from osteoporosis.
Advanced dental attrition is evident with the crowns markedly worn. The
maxilla is missing the right canine, which was lost postmortem. Both right and
left second and third molar sockets show bone resorption, which indicates
antemortem tooth loss. Both mandibular central incisors, the left first and second
premolars, and the first permanent molar, were lost antemortem. The right lateral
incisor, and the right and left canines, were lost postmortem. All other teeth were
present in their sockets. Extensive caries affected three teeth, causing pulp
exposure in two of them. Pulp exposure in three other teeth occurred because of
marked attrition. All the maxillary molars had abscesses. They were probably
responsible for the loss of all but the first molar. Mandibular abscesses were seen
in both central incisors, the left second incisor, the left canine, the left second
premolar, and the left first and second molars. Four of these teeth were missing
because of the abscesses. No evidence of perimortem trauma was seen.

Burial 6
This skeleton was identified by Martin (1994) in the field, but it was not
excavated.

Burial 7A - Unit B
This is the incomplete skeleton of a child estimated to be between 6.5 and
7.5 years old. No sex determination was attempted because of the young age of
the child.
Missing elements of the skull include the left zygoma, left maxilla, left and
right palatine, and the hyoid. Missing postcranial elements include the sternum,
both scapulae, both clavicles, both patellae, the coccyx, left humerus, both radii,
both ulnae, the right femur, 10 fight and left fibs, first and seventh cervical
vertebrae, the entire thoracic spine, and the third lumbar vertebra.
A separate bag of maxillary teeth found packed with the skeleton was
determined to belong with Burial 7A, and they provided additional data with
which to determine age. The deciduous central and lateral incisors of both the
maxilla and mandible were exfoliated while the child was living. The maxillary

210

Texas Archeological Society

deciduous left canine may also have been lost in this manner. The mandibular
deciduous right canine and permanent central incisor were lost postmortem. The
maxillary permanent central and lateral incisors had erupted, but all other maxillary permanent teeth were unerupted. The mandible retained the deciduous left
canine, and both deciduous first and second molars. The permanent central and
lateral incisors had erupted but the left central was lost postmortem.
Caries was found interproximally (between the teeth) and on the root of the
deciduous fight and left first molars. One occlusal pit caries was found on the
mandibular permanent fight first molar.
Very slight ectocranial porosis was found on the occipital bone, but was so
insignificant that it was not coded for this study. No other pathology or trauma
was detected for Burial 7A.

Burial 7B - Unit B

This is the skeleton of a child estimated to be between 3.5 and 4.5 years of
age at death. It was found with burial 7A after the excavation of the mass burial
of individuals 8-12 was completed. Since it was a single interment, it is included
here (It is referred to as Burial 13 by Martin [1994]).
Postcrania present included the body of the sternum, part of the left scapula,
parts of both radii, an ulnar fragment, a fragmentary right femur and an almost
complete left femur, right and left tibiae, and the left fibula. No fibs, vertebrae, or
sacrum were included.
Due to the fragmentary condition of this skeleton and absence of any facial
material, the estimated age was based on estimated femur length (Ubelaker
1978). No estimation of sex was attempted. There was rodent gnawing on the left
femur diaphysis. No other pathology or trauma was detected.

MASS BURIAL
Burial 8 - Unit B
The skull of this 16-20 year old female was the first encountered during the
excavation of the mass burial. It was not found in anatomical position with the
postcrania. The arms were positioned between this skull and that of Burial 9 and
were among the first bones found. Packed with the carpals of this skeleton were
also found the hand bones of at least two other individuals. These were those of
an older male and of a younger child. A 6 to 10 year old sternal body and first
metatarsal were also found commingled with this skeleton. A right mandibular
second premolar was found as well, but it could not be positively identified as
belonging to this individual. The mandible, hyoid, sternum, coccyx, and the first,
second, and third cervical vertebrae for Burial 8 were not recovered.

Albrecht -- Dillard Site Osteological Analysis

211

Aging of this skeleton was determined both by dentition and epiphyseat
state. The maxillary third molars were root complete, although not erupted. The
proximal humeral head and ulnar epiphyses were in the terminal stages of
closure, as was the iliac crest. Ischial epiphyses were nearly complete, except the
anterior portion.
The determination of sex of Burial 8 was based mainly on the morphology
of the pelvis and skull. The cranial vault was smooth, gracile, and consistent with
that of a female. The pelvis was wide, shallow and possessed a wide sciatic
notch.
There was Slight, localized ectocranial porosis noted on the occipital bone,
the parietals, and the frontal bone. No other pathology or trauma was evidenced,
and no cuts were found on the crania or postcrania.
Anterior teeth were missing due to postmortem loss, not trauma. The right
mandibular second premolar found with this skeleton had been gnawed on by
rodents.

Burial 9 - Unit B

This is a male skeleton estimated to be 30-34 years of age at death. The
skull was the second uncovered during the excavation and was the highest within
the grave. The skeleton was, however, one of the last two exhumed because it
was below Burials 8, 10, and 11. The hyoid, coccyx, three right and three left
ribs, and the first cervical vertebra are missing for this individual.
Age estimation was based on the condition of epiphyseal closure and the
pelvic bones. The sacrum is fused and there is no buildup in the postauricular
area of the pelvis. The pubic symphysis suggests an age of 30 to 34 years.
Sex determination was based on skull and pelvic morphology. The skull
displays prominent supraorbital ridges, nuchal notch and mastoids, and the mandible is large and heavy. The pelvis is typically male: large with a narrow sciatic
notch and no buildup of the post-auricular area.
The maxillary central incisors, the mandibular central and lateral incisors,
left canine, and left second premolar were lost postmortem. All other teeth are
present and in good condition with the exception of a large carious lesion in the
impacted mandibular left third molar. None of the teeth are abscessed, and
enamel wear is not excessive for this group.
Slight osteoarthritis lipping is noted on both calcanei and tali, but otherwise
no evidence is apparent that this individual had arthritis. A remnant of the
metopic suture is present on the anterior and inferior aspect of the frontal bone.
There is a small circular (8 x 9 mm) healed depression fracture in the middle
of the left parietal. No other trauma is seen, and with the exception of slight
arthritis seen on the heel and ankle bones, no pathologies were noted. The
acquisition of the V-shaped cleft in the left clavicle was determined not to be
perimortem but rather postmortem in nature.

212

Texas Archeological Society

No cuts were found on this skeleton. Rodent gnawing was observed on the
distal linea aspera of the right femur.

Burial 10 - Unit B
This skeleton of a 27 to 34 year old male was nearly complete. It was
missing only the coccyx, one rib from each side, one thoracic vertebra, and the
first and second cervical vertebrae. There were 14 thoracic vertebrae packed with
this skeleton, two of which could not be articulated. Although the ribs were
badly fragmented, the possibility of a 13th rib could not be ruled out. An extra
right clavicle found packed with Burial 8 was determined to belong to this skeleton.
Burial 10’s age was determined by recent epiphyseal fusing of the medial
clavicle and iliac crest; the sacrum is also fused. The development of the symphysis pubis supports an estimate of 27-34 years of age.
Sex determination was based on skull and pelvic morphology and long bone
size and ruggedness. The supraorbital ridges, mastoids, mandibular size and
shape, and the nuchal notch, all confirm maleness. The pelvis had the classic
male shape with a narrow sciatic notch.
Burial 10 retained all its permanent teeth. Caries were seen on the left
maxillary third molar and both mandibular third molars. The lateral maxillary
incisors were peg shaped (barrel). The third molars showed little attrition; no
abscessing was seen.
There is no arthritis of the spine and the sacroiliac joint is smooth. Widespread active ectocranial porosis was seen on the frontal bone, both parietals, and
the occiput. Osteochondritis dissecans (localized necrosis, followed by degenerative changes in the articular cartilage) was found on the medial condyle of the left
distal femur (Loveland et al. 1984).
No cuts, no evidence of trauma, and no other pathology were seen on this
skeleton.

Burial 11 - Unit B
This is a female skeleton judged to be 17-21 years of age at death. The
hyoid, right scapula, coccyx, both patellae, left humerus, two left ribs and one
right rib, and the second through sixth cervical vertebrae, were missing.
The age estimation was based on the development and condition of the teeth
and the progression of epiphyseal closure. The third molars were root complete
and the crowns show wear. The palatine incisive foramen is gone, the ilium is
fusing, and the proximal femur is fused. The clavicular epiphysis is not fused and
the proximal humerus has not reached final closure stage.
Sex determination was based on the small, gracile, smooth skull. The
mastoids were small and delicate and there was no significant nuchal notch. The

frontal bone had no supraorbital ridges. The pelvis did have a very deep narrow
sciatic notch, but other postcrania were consistent with the female designation.
There was postmortem tooth loss of the maxillary right central and lateral
incisors, right first and second premolars, the left canine, and both premolars.
The symphyseal portion of the mandible was missing, but only the right central
incisor, the left central and lateral incisors, the canine, and the first premolar
were lost. Caries was present in the maxillary third molar, the mandibular right
first molar, and all three left molars; no abscesses were found.
There is a slight localized ectocranial porosis on the occipital bone. Both
tibiae show moderate but well-healed periostitis. X-rays demonstrated increased
cortical thickness in these bones. The distal right humerus has a billowy, very
slightly swollen quality that seems atypical. The atlas (first cervical vertebra)
was discovered in the laboratory while cleaning the muddy clay of the burial pit
from the skull. It was displaced forward of the foramen magnum. No cuts or
evidence of trauma were found.

Burial 12 - Unit B

This skeleton of a 35 to 44 year old female was found in a flexed, prone
position under the other four individuals in this grave (the others were all
extended). The hyoid, coccyx, left clavicle, left innominate, left femur, the first,
1 lth and 12th ribs bilaterally, and the first through fifth cervical vertebrae, were
all missing.
The age estimate was based on visual examination of the skeleton. All
epiphyses were closed and obliterated. Dental attrition due to abrasion was
significant. The symphysis pubis suggests an middle aged to older female.
Sex was determined by visual examination of the skull, pelvis, and long
bones. The skull had no supraorbital ridges, small mastoids, sharp supraorbital
margins, no nuchal notch, and the gonial angle of the mandible was pulled
inwardly. This female had probably had children since there was a large
preauricular sulcus on the pelvis and parturition pits on the dorsal surface of the
pubis (Suchey et al. 1979). There was a ventral arc on the pubic bone, a wide
shallow sciatic notch, and an elevated sacro-iliac articulation. The humeri had
septal apertures which tend support to the determination of female gender
(Trotter 1934).
With the exception of a congenitally missing right third molar, all
mandibular teeth were present. Both maxillary central incisors were lost
postmortem as was the right maxillary canine. Caries were evident on both
maxillary first molars and the right second molar. On the mandible, only the right
second molar was carious. The left maxillary first molar also suffered pulp
exposure and alveolar abscess. The incisors were shovel shaped.
Porosity is seen on both temporal mandibular joint surfaces, and
ectocranially on the parietals and occiput. Osteophytes and porosity are found on

214

cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebra. One lumbar vertebra was found to be
eburnated on an articular facet. Several of the vertebra had Schmorl’s depressions.
Distal femoral cortical excavation (Mann and Murphy 1990) is seen on the
medial side of the posterior surface of the right femur.
No evidence of perimortem trauma was seen.
Included with the skeletons were bones that could not be assigned to any of
the twelve analyzed individuals. Since space considerations prohibited laying out
all the burials at once, it is conceivable that some matches exist that were not
recognized. Some, however, are clearly not of the age groups represented in this
sample from the Dillard site and some are duplicates of bones already inventoried. The extraneous bones are likely from disturbances of other interments in the
cemetery at the site.

DISCUSSION
The seven single burials included two old adult males and five children. The
two old males, Burials 3 and 5, suffered extensive dental disease and
osteoarthritis. There is no evidence of perimortem trauma that would suggest a
violent cause of death. More likely, they grew old, and died of natural causes.
Neither did the five children show signs of trauma that would suggest violent death. Rather, slight ectocranial porosis, cribra orbitalis, heavy dental attrition, caries, and enamel hypoplasia are seen, suggesting stress and possible
nutritional deficiencies. It is likely that these children succumbed to childhood
diseases.
In the mass burial, two men in their 30s, two very young women in their late
teens or early 20s, and an older woman in her 40s were found together. Although
the older woman had significant dental attrition, she had kept her teeth and had
only one abscess. She had some arthritis, but it was not extensive or severe. A
cortical excavation on her distal right femur was seen at a muscle insertion site.
The older of the young women had evidence of healed periostitis. One of the men
had a small healed depressed skull fracture. Osteochondritis dissecans was seen
on the distal left femur of the younger male. This is often seen clinically, but
rarely reported in bioarcheological literature (Loveland et al. 1984).
Six of the 12 skeletons showed mild ectocranial porosis. Eight of the 12
were found to have caries. Only one adult had none, and one individual (Burial
7B) had no dentition to examine. The old men had extremely worn, carious,
abscessed teeth. This pattern reflects the diet of these people, and suggests a high
carbohydrate intake as well as food processing techniques that introduced considerable grit into the diet.
Although the state of preservation of the bones was remarkable, an unexplainable loss of skeletal elements was common. This loss was seen in both the
individual interments and in the group grave.

CONCLUSION
When decapitations and mutilations occur there usually is good osteological
evidence of its occurrence. Cuts are found on the ascending ramus of the mandible, around the foramen magnum, and on the cervical vertebra, usually the first
and second (Willey 1991). Dismemberment of the arms would be expected to
leave some trace of the act on either the humeral head, around or in the glenoid
cavity, and/or on the acromion or coracoid processes of the scapula. Turner
(1983) believes that perimortem breakage, cutmarks, and burning are fundamental properties of bone altered by human intent. None of these properties were
found in this sample from the Dillard site.
The fact that some skulls and arms were displaced so far from their normal
anatomical position is not easy to explain. Perhaps the cause of the displacements
and disturbances can be explained by natural postmortem taphonomic processes.
Rodent gnawing was detected on four bones from three burials, and on one tooth
from a different burial. Two of these burials were within the mass grave. This
evidence that there was rodent activity within the mass grave, and with some of
the individual graves, suggests animal transportation of the bones. Field tests
have shown that buried bones do migrate underground when disturbances as
slight as treading occur on the surface (Bielenstein 1990). Other taphonomic
processes include: settling of the backfill of the burials as soft tissue decay
progresses, migration of the bones due to surface disturbance, or differential
bone attrition within the graves possibly due to variations in microclimate.
Of the 12 recognized burials, only three had complete cervical spines when
examined. Of those three, only one was an adult, and all of them were interred
in single burials. Not one individual in the mass burial had a complete cervical
spine. Even Burial 10, ostensibly the unmutilated important person (Martin
1994), whose head was thought to have been articulated with his cervical spine,
was missing both the first and second cervical vertebrae. The mandible from
Burial 8 was never located. A portion of the mandible from Burial 7 was "found
beneath the skull; the remaining two-thirds was missing" (Martin 1994:136).
Not surprisingly, no cocci were found in any of the graves and only one
horn of one hyoid was found. Examples of other missing bones include 61
ribs (not counting the fragmentary child in Burial 7B), 10 patellae, and four
clavicles. Evidence such as this could also suggest continuing disturbances of
old graves as new burial pits were dug. The bones left over came from somewhere else within the cemetery. There was no evidence of any graves immediately above the mass grave. Burials 7A and 7B were close on one side and
Burial 2 was close on the other, but the leftover bones could not be matched
to any of these graves.
The age distribution of the skeletons in the graves excavated so far at the
Dillard Site is skewed. The young and the old are represented in single grave
burials. Those in the middle age range are found in the mass burial. That
something catastrophic happened at the Dillard site long ago is possible. The

216

circumstances that would cause a middle-aged woman, two very young women,
and two men in the prime of their lives to die together and be buried together is
open for further speculation. However, there is no osteological evidence that
confirms either sacrifice, mutilation, or dismemberment.

Kim A. Cox

ABSTRACT
The American Oyster, Crassostrea virginica, is offered as a substitute for
artifacts, which are scarce in most coastal archeological deposits. Various
methods of analysis of archeological oyster deposits are examined as they
relate to human ecology on the macro- and micro-scales, and as they contribute to our understanding of Holocene environments. The focus of this article is
the Archaic of the central Texas coast.

INTRODUCTION
Although archeological deposits from the Archaic are quite common along
the Texas Gulf Coast, most are comprised of estuarine shell matrices that have
produced few, if any, artifacts. Often as extensive and as difficult to excavate
as burned rock middens, these shell deposits, with the exception of a handful
of cultural resource management projects, have not drawn the wide attention
of their Central Texas counterparts, principally because the dearth of artifacts
has long been equated with a lack of discernible information.
Then, beginning in the late 1980s, innovations in shellfish analysis (e.g.,
Custer and Doms 1990; Kent 1988; Lawrence 1988, 1989) led to the emergence of the long ignored American Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) as a major
archeological resource. Through these inventive approaches and techniques,
the oyster became not only a worthy substitute for artifacts, in many cases it
was to become vastly superior in the quantitative and qualitative production
of archeological information. This new recognition of the importance of the
oyster was, in many respects, to revolutionize coastal archeology.
Although still in their formative stages, the analyses and approaches discussed here are ones in which the oyster has already yielded meaningful information. The techniques and the significance of the inquiries are examined
as they relate to human ecology on the macro- and micro-scales, and as they
provide information for deciphering Holocene environments. The analyses rely
heavily on intersite comparisons; the data from as many as 34 dated shell strata
have been used in their formation.

HUMAN ADAPTATIONS AND COASTAL ECOLOGY

The coastal Archaic of the central Texas coast was originally defined by T.
N. Campbell (1947). He characterized it as a pre-ceramic, hunting/gathering
expression (called the Aransas Focus) with a homogeneous lifestyle, identified
by crude stone dart points and a suite of shell tools, that supposedly persisted
from some unspecified date until the advent of the Late Prehistoric period. Until
recently, this was the extent of knowledge, more or less, of coastal Archaic
adaptations (e.g., Prewitt et al. 1987; Shafer and Bond 1985; Steele and Mokry
1985). The demise of the Aransas Focus as a viable concept came when the
radiocarbon dating of numerous well-stratified shell deposits led to the realignment of the coastal Archaic in terms of human ecology (see discussion in Ricklis
1990, 1993; Ricklis and Cox 1991).

RADIOCARBON DATES AND THE CHRONOLOGY
OF HUMAN COASTAL ADAPTATION
Generally, archeological shell strata produce little datable material other
than shells. However, the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating of estuarine shells,
and the viability of certain correction factors and the irrelevance of others, have
recently been demonstrated through the use of paired shell/charcoal dates (Ricklis
and Cox 1991; Ricklis 1993).
When properly adjusted and plotted chronologically, radiocarbon dates from
sites on the central Texas coast with intensive use of estuarine resources show an
unmistakable temporal clustering (Figure 1 and Table 1). Ricklis (1993) has
theorized that this periodicity, supported by the presence or absence of certain
time-diagnostic projectile point types in surface collections, indicates intensive
human exploitation of estuarine resources only in times of sea level stability (see
also Bloom 1983; Custer 1988; Reitz 1988; Widmer 1988).
Furthermore, the patterning of human coastal occupation, as Ricklis (1993)
and Bernstein (1993) argue, has significant implications for the relative value of
the estuary as an exploitable biomass, as well as for the microscopic
phytoplanktons at the bottom end of its food chains. If people did not intensively
use the estuaries during periods of rapid Holocene sea level rise, the food
resources were most likely not as available to them during such times (Custer
1988). Assuming this to be true, one must look for ways in which a rapidly rising
sea can adversely affect an estuarine biome (cf. Widmer 1988). Both Ricklis
(1993) for the Texas Coast, and Bernstein (1993) for the southern New England
coast, have suggested that this was the result of rising sea levels changing highly
productive estuarine ecosystems into much less productive marine ecosystems

Much of the supporting documentation for these data is presented at length in Ricktis
(1993).

(see Perlman [1980] for a discussion of contrasting levels of productivity of
estuarine and marine ecosystems).
At the end of the last Ice Age, rapid sea level rise sent marine waters far up
the deeply downcut Pleistocene river valleys, creating fjord-like estuaries quite
different in appearance from the bay/lagoon estuaries of today. Initial evidence
of estuarine adaptation in Texas comes from the end of the first major sea level
stillstand, which occured between approximately 9000-7000 B.P. (see Figure 1).
This was followed by major stillstands at ca. 5900-4200 B.P., and from ca. 3000
B.P. to present (see Brown et al. 1976; Frazier 1974; Prewitt and Paine 1988). As

the continuing sedimentation process began to catch up with sea level during
stillstand (see Dalrymple et al. 1992), highly photosynthetic shallows aided in
turning the estuaries into rich areas of primary organic production, where the
phytoplanktons and the salt grasses flourished.
The creation of highly productive estuarine biomes during periods of
stillstand was probably facilitated in the Middle Holocene, and certainly in the
Late Holocene, by the formation of barrier shoals and islands (see Ricklis 1993).
These had the effect of trapping river-borne nutrients and sediments and reducing turbidity and salinity, turning the estuaries into some of the world’s most
highly productive ecosystems (Odum 1971; Whittaker 1975). By comparison,
equal areas of the world’s oceans are as much as 1000 times less productive
(Valiela 1984).
With the advent of rapid sea level rise after the first two major stillstands,
sea level increases of an estimated 100 cm/century (see Paine 1991:170) pulled
away from much lower sedimentation rates (between 6-22 cm/century to approximately 38 cm/century [Shepard and Moore 1960; Widmer 1988]), inundating the estuaries’ shallows and marshes, diluting their nutrients and increasing
marine influences. The wide salinity gradient upon which highly productive
estuaries depended (Bulger et al. 1993) was most likely compressed into the

224

lower river systems, where fshing and shellfishing may have continued (see
Weinstein 1994). Primary production, which thrived in the shallow, less turbid,
and more brackish estuarine waters during stillstand, would likely have been
greatly affected by the shift to heavy marine influence.
Because all subsequent levels on the estuarine food chain, including oysters,
are either directly or indirectly dependent on primary production, periods of
rising sea level probably had the effect of greatly reducing the density of oysters,
and of turning what was perhaps never more than a marginal human food
resource into one whose reduced abundance no longer justified its exploitation
(see Perlman 1980). Thus, through a series of deductions supported by modern
analogs, the radiocarbon dating of estuarine shells not only led to the complete
realignment of the coastal Archaic in terms of human ecology, it also focused
attention on the effects of environmental change on the exploitable estuarine
biomass (Ricklis 1993).

SEASONALITY
It has long been known that most bivalves exhibit annual growth patterns
on the exteriors of their shells (Lutz and Rhoads 1980). Over a decade ago,
Lawrence Aten (1981) pioneered a method for the determination of seasonality through the examination of these annuli on Rangia from archeological shell
middens on the upper Texas coast. Theoretically, the same could have been
done for oysters, which are at least as prevalent as Rangia in coastal archeological sites, but they seem to have frustrated all attempts of accurately deciphering their outer shell growth rings (see Claassen 1986; Palmer and Carriker
1979).
Oysters, however, unlike other bivalves, also show growth annuli on the
ligostracum of their umbos or hinges (Figure 2). As pointed out by Kent (1988),
these annuli are far easier to read and are more reliable than those on the oyster’s
exterior surfaces. Previous attempts had been made to use these annuli to determine age and season of death (e.g., Sambol and Finks 1977; Waselkov 1982,
1987). But it was not until Kent (1988) and Lawrence (1988) published their
results that the efficacy of the technique of examining oyster umbos for seasonality was firmly established.
This method was based on comparisons of monthly growth rates of umbo
annuli on live oysters through their yearly cycle. Relying on these modern
growth rates, Kent (1988), Lawrence (1988), and Custer and Doms (1990) have
determined season of death on archeological samples by measuring the distance
of growth past the last winter growth break, and comparing it to previous annuli
on the same valve.
Kent’s and Lawrence’s pioneering method relies, however, on the ability
of the oyster analyst to read winter growth breaks, and, to a lesser extent, on
their knowledge of the growth rates of the archeological samples being analyzed
(Claassen 1991). This has led to criticism by archeologists such as Russo

225

Figure 2. Winter/early spring growth annuli on lower umbos of Crassostrea virginica.

(1991a, 199 l b), who found that oysters from "southern" waters do not produce
distinctive winter growth breaks (a fact acknowledged by Kent [1988]).
While this may be true of the Florida oysters examined by Russo and Kent,
it has not proven to be the case for oysters from the Texas coast today (Cox and
Cox 1993; Ricklis 1990). Galtsoff (1964) has reported that the fastest growth rate
of Crassostrea virginica is in water temperatures between 15-20° C, with growth
virtually ceasing in the lower direction at 10° C and significantly declining in the
upward direction at 25° C (cf. Austin et al. 1993; Haven and Morales-Alamo
t966). Hildebrand and King (1979), and recent unpublished data from the Texas
Parks & Wildlife Department (Cox and Cox 1993:Figure 2), show that water
temperatures in the Coastal Bend of Texas usually average between 10-15° C for
the months of December and January, with actual temperatures sometimes falling below 10° C during those months. By contrast, information presented by
Chestnut (1974) shows that winter water temperatures on the west coast of
Florida average about 8° C warmer than those of the central Texas coast. This
seems to explain the lack of distinctive winter growth breaks observed by Russo
and Kent on Florida oysters, and why distinctive winter growth breaks do appear
on Texas oysters.
The method suggested by Kent (1988) was recently applied to numerous
oyster deposits from the White’s Point archeological area on the north side of
Nueces Bay (Cox and Cox 1993). A random sampling of 100 lower valves from
modem oyster beds and reefs from upper and lower Nueces Bay indicated that

226

oysters tend to die naturally in the summer (Figure 3). This is consistent with the
findings of Gunter (1955) on mortality rates of Crassostrea virginica from the
Texas Gulf Coast.

The aggregate graph of the oysters from White’s Point (Figure 4), as well as
those from the individual strata (see Cox and Cox 1993), however, exhibited a
tendency toward a winter/early spring season of death. This is the time of year
when their carbohydrate and glycogen contents were at their highest (Hopkins et
al. 1954; Soniat and Ray 1985).
Ricklis (1988, 1990) had argued that the Late Prehistoric populations of
the central Texas coast occupied the coast on a seasonal basis. The seasonality
data from White’s Point indicated that this pattern was at least 7500 years old
(Ricklis 1993).

DENSITY AND CONTENT OF SHELL STRATA
At White’s Point, all shell deposits were thin with tow artifact densities.
With the possible exception of Kent-Crane (41AS3) on Copano Bay, this is true
for all Archaic shell deposits in the Coastal Bend area of Texas prior to approximately 1800 B.P. These shell deposits appear to be the results of single procurement episodes by small groups of people (cf. Lavin 1988; Stein 1992). The
appearance of more extensive deposits after that time corresponds to a major
shift in settlement and biotic procurement patterns beginning in the very Late
Archaic and extending into the Late Prehistoric period (Ricklis 1990, 1993).
These later shell deposits have higher artifact densities, evidencing much greater
ranges of activity, and produce much more abundant fish remains (Ricklis t990,
1993; Weinstein 1992, 1994).
Through the examination of the density and content of shell deposits, we
can determine the relative value of the estuary to prehistoric populations
(Waselkov 1987). By all indications, Late Prehistoric sites like 41SP120 on
Corpus Christi Bay (Ricklis 1990, 1993) and 41CL2 on San Antonio Bay
(Weinstein 1992) supported much larger populations than did their Early and
Middle Holocene counterparts.
By converting the size of shellfish and fish otoliths to calories, a general
idea can be obtained of calories being extracted from the estuarine biomass by
time period (see Bernstein 1993). Unfortunately, an absolute comparison between time periods of tota! calories consumed at a site (and from there to
population estimates) is difficult to determine because, among other things, bone
from Early and Middle Holocene deposits does not often survive (see Ricklis
1988). Nevertheless, the relative value of estuarine resources is a subject that will
continue to draw considerable attention, principally because of its implications
for the Late Archaic aggregation of coastal populations (see Ricklis 1990), and
the possible development of complex social organization in societies that never
adopted agriculture (cf. Arnold 1992; Marquardt 1985; Russo 1988).
Waselkov (1987) and Henshilwood et al. (1994) have also suggested that
the absence of artifacts in some shell middens is important. They argue that if
women and children were principally responsible for the middens, one would not

228

Texas Archeological Society

expect to see certain types of artifacts. This would also mean that these types of
shell heaps are strictly related to a specific food procurement activity, with main
residential sites usually located some distance away.

HUMAN PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES
Lower vs. Upper Shell Ratios
In trying to establish an absolute number of calories by strata, one factor
that comes into play is determining the total number of oysters consumed. While
the obvious approach of taking the total number of valves and dividing by two is
logical, it is also probably inaccurate.
Oysters, like many bivalves, contain distinct upper (or right) and lower (or
left) valves. The upper valve is usually flat with a concave umbo. The lower
valve is more cupped and has a convex umbo (technically the "chondrophore").
When the oyster umbos from White’s Point were separated in the field, the
results showed a consistent weighting toward the lower valve (Table 2). This is a
curious phenomenon that seems to be a regular feature in other archeological
areas on the Texas coast (e.g., Weinstein 1994). Since even fragmented upper
and lower umbos are easily identifiable, and since a meticulous attempt was
made at White’s Point to identify all umbos in the field (see discussion in Ricklis
1993), it is doubtful that the noted difference was a result of differential preservation between upper and lower umbos. Indeed, some deposits that contained very
few fragmented shells, such as the upper level at 41SP177, produced some of the
most striking disparities.
Therefore, as suggested by Bernstein (1993:65), in determining the minimum number of individuals, the number of lower umbos would have to be used.
If, however, all oysters were being shucked at the site of procurement and were
being brought "on the half shell," the actual number of individuals in the archeological deposits would be represented by the total number of valves and not
merely lower ones. It should be pointed out that attempts were made at White’s
Point to pair larger valves but that they were never successful. Theoretically, if
oysters were being shucked where the shells were being deposited, it should be
fairly easy to match large, unique, upper and lower valves (see Koike 1979). To
date, no one has demonstrated that this can be done for archeological oyster
deposits. The tendency toward a prevalence of lower valves may also have its
uses in determining whether certain shell strata are the results of human food
procurement or the results of natural processes.

Evidence of Opening Techniques
Kent (1988) and Waselkov (1987) have reported archeological evidence of
opening oysters appearing as fire scorching and shucking. This latter technique,

which involves opening the oysters without cooking the meat, includes fracturing, insertion of sharp objects to separate the valves, and hammering (stunning
the valves open).
While scorching is rare on the White’s Point oysters (with the exception of a
hearth area at 41SP153), possibly intentional shell damage on many valves was
documented during laboratory analyses. In some instances, this damage was
apparently caused by the insertion of a strong, sharp object between the valves on
the anterior side of the oyster slightly below the umbo, producing identifiable
shell damage (Figure 5). Frequently, the distal end of the shell was also chipped,
perhaps to break the airlock (Waselkov 1987), or perhaps to insert a long, thin
object to slice the adductor muscle (Kent 1988).
In field experiments, hammering above the adductor muscle with a heavy
object would sometimes cause the oyster to open enough to insert a sharp instrument to slice the adductor muscle; this was most easily done at its attachment on the upper valve. This technique left no noticeable damage on either
valve.
While there was apparent evidence of shucking from many sites at White’s
Point, it was never universal, and greatly varied in percentages in deposits where
it did occur. Several deposits produced few if any valves that evidenced shucking
damage. None of the valves from a hearth area at 41SP153, for instance, showed
shucking damage to their shells. These were the only valves that had been
scorched in a fire, and were also the only valves in which there were equal
numbers of upper and lower valves, implying a different opening technique.

In their analysis of Late Holocene mussel shell "megamiddens" in South
Africa, Henshilwood et al. (1994:104) suggested that "shells discarded as part of
a processing strategy should be distinguishable from those discarded after in situ
meat consumption according to the signature they leave in the archaeological
record." Through experimentation, they concluded that the most efficient method
of processing large quantities of mussels was to smoke or sun bake them in the
half shell (cf. Kent 1988:55). The result is a light weight, highly nutritious food
bulk that could be consumed without subsequent risk of food poisoning. Thus,
they argued that the large Late Holocene middens were actually "localities where
mussels were dried by work groups of hunter-gatherers prior to being transported
and consumed inland" (Henshilwood et al. 1994:104).
No similar experiments have been undertaken with oysters, but such an
activity could explain the prevalence of lower valves. As Waselkov (1987:103)
pointed out, "since hand shucking is more time-consuming than roasting, there
must be some incentive to avoid cooking the mollusc." The incentive could be
for long-term meat preservation in the fashion described above. Since oysters can
be easily smoked or dried for preservation, the possibility of mass extraction for
future consumption has to be considered.

Height]Width Ratios
Based on studies of oysters procured from different environments, Kent
(1988) proposed a method for analyzing their height/width ratios (H/W): the

Cox -- Oysters as Ecofacts

231

maximum dorsal-ventral measurement over the maximum anterior-posterior measurement (for purposes of clarity, the term "width" is used instead of the more
scientifically accurate term "length"). These environments were identified as:
H/W Ratio less than 1.3: beaches and bars of coarse, firmly packed
sand.

H/W Ratio between 1.3 and 2.0: mixed mud with sand, oysters occur
either singly or in loose clusters.
H/W Ratio greater than 2.0: soft mud bottoms, generally in deeper
channels, that produce large oysters, or oyster reefs that produce small,
elongated oysters.
In an examination of oysters from coastal Georgia, Crook (1992) found four
basic types of intertidal oyster communities: (1) singles (including small clumps
of not more than six oysters from soft mud along small tidal creeks), (2) clusters (usually 10-30 attached oysters from firm bottoms along larger tidal streams,
or from softer muddy bottoms within tidal flats), (3) bank communities (usually
more than 30 attached individuals found in large tidal streams on either firm or
dead oyster substrates), and (4) reef communities (very dense and closely spaced
clumps of 30 or more oysters living on a dead oyster substrate). In the sampled
communities, Crook (1992) obtained measurements of average height, width,
H/W ratios, and size index (the square root of H x W):

All of the oysters from White’s Point from Early and Middle Holocene
deposits fell in the fairly narrow H/W range of 1.63 to 1.76 (Table 3), at the
upper end of Kent’s scale for bed oysters and in line with Crook’s communities
of singles, clusters, and bank oysters. Average heights and widths approximate
Crook’s (1992) communities of clusters and banks. However, modem oysters
from reefs and large bank communities in upper Nueces Bay, as well as commercially harvested oysters from Aransas and Matagorda bays, average 1.7, indicating that the Early and Middle Holocene oysters from White’s Point were from
communities similar to those existing today. The obvious differences with Kent’s
and Crook’s reef oysters are most likely due to slight differences in method of
height measurement (see Kent 1988:29; Cox and Cox [1993] simply took the
longest dorsal-ventral measurement), and also perhaps due to different sampling

232

Texas Archeological Society

techniques (most modem samples from Nueces Bay were legal size, 7.5 cm, or
larger), and the different reef environments of the Texas coast vs. those of
Maryland and Georgia. Overharvesting of reef oysters apparently was of no
significance, since the reefs from upper Nueces Bay, where commercial harvesting has been off-limits for years, had similar H/W ratios to the heavily harvested
reefs of Aransas and Matagorda bays.

Since by far the densest biomass of oysters exists in large bank and reef
communities (Chestnut 1974; Hedgpeth 1957), if we view human adaptation as a
response to an exploitable biomass, then the focus of attention should be on the
large, easily exploitable, oyster communities as food resources. Almost certainly,
oysters have lived in Nueces Bay from its initial inundation (Gunter 1979).
However, its dense communities of oysters would not have flourished in times of
high salinities (Britton and Morton 1989; Claassen 1985), active wave action, or
strong currents (Galtsoff 1964; MacKenzie 1981), all of which conditions most
likely prevailed in times of marine influence during rapid sea level rise. Productive communities today are largest and most prevalent in the less turbid waters
behind the barrier islands away from marine influenced areas (Britton and Morton
1989; Chestnut 1974).
The consistency in the H/W ratios from White’s Point not only shows that
oysters were gathered from similar environments over long periods of time, it
also demonstrates the marginality of the oyster as a food resource. With the

Cox ~ Oysters as Ecofacts

233

destruction of the dense oyster communities from rising sea level, the return for
the human energy expended apparently did not justify the effort in exploiting
other oyster habitats. During times of heavy marine influence, because of reduced densities, the oyster had declined in value relative to alternative terrestrial
resources to the extent that human food procurement patterns were radically
changed.
Ultimately, then, the virtual abandonment of the estuaries as a food resource area during times of rapid sea level rise was an indirect result of climatic changes. An understanding of these climatic changes and their effects
would greatly facilitate an understanding of the intricate interplay between the
relative values of terrestrial and estuarine resources. Several authors have
recently dealt with the subject of human settlement patterns being a result of
environmental conditions affecting terrestrial resources (e.g., Leonard and Reed
1993). However, the effect of a changing climate on estuarine resources is still
not well understood. It is in this regard that the study of archeological oyster
deposits will probably make its greatest contribution.

SALINITY DATA
Crassostrea virginica often appear in coastal environments encrusted with
a myriad of organisms. As Crassostrea virginica is euryhaline, most of its encrusting organisms live in much narrower salinity ranges. Kent (1988) proposed a method for determining salinity of oyster environments based on
evidence of the encrusting sponge of the phylum Porifera and genus Cliona.
The different species of this sponge inhabit different salinity ranges in the
estuaries and produce their own distinctive size of boreholes.
Based on studies by Hopkins (1956), Kent (1988) devised a system for
determining salinity that relied on the relative percentages of small boreholes
(incurrent 0.2-0.5 mm, excurrent 0.6-1.6 mm) and large boreholes (incurrent
0.8-2.5, excurrent 2.0-4.5 mm) on oyster valves. The system, as slightly
modified by Cox and Cox (1993) and adapted to the central Texas coast, is as
follows:

Cox and Cox (1993) identified the salinity ranges for the shell-boring
polychaete Polydora websteri from data on file with the Texas Parks & Wildlife
Department, Rockport, Texas (see Wargo and Ford [1993] for a detailed discussion of other environmental requirements of Polydora sp., and their effects on
the condition of oysters). Salinity ranges of estuarine shellfish species are from
Castagna and Chanley (1973) and Castagna (1992 personal communication).
This system of salinity regimes was applied to all oyster deposits at White’s
Point. The oyster shell strata (s. s.) dated, the median of the corrected and
calibrated 1-sigma range, and the salinity regime are presented in the following

(70-80 cm) is an average of the actual radiocarbon dates that bracket it.
When compared to recently revised effective moisture ranges for Central
Texas (Toomey et al. 1993), Figure 7 presents interesting parallels in two respects. First, the post-glacial minimum in effective moisture in Central Texas
from ca. 5000-2500 B.P. (Toomey et al. 1993) roughly corresponds chronologically to higher salinity readings in Nueces Bay. And second, the return to more
mesic conditions from ca. 2500-1000 B.P. (Aikens 1983; Toomey et al. 1993),
with a peak between 1350-1250 B.P. (cf. Aikens 1983), approximately matches
the significant decrease in salinity in Nueces Bay beginning around 3000 B.P.
and extending until about 1300 B.P.

When xeric conditions once again prevailed at ca. 1000 B.P., White’s Point
quite possibly was no longer generally suitable for human occupation and had
been abandoned. Perhaps this is because fishing had taken the place of shellfish
gathering as the primary focus of estuarine exploitation (Ricklis 1993), and
possibly also because the small streams that helped support human occupation
there had quit flowing (cf. Hall 1990).

READABILITY
As discussed above, both Kent (1988) and Russo (1991a, 1991b) found
difficulty in determining seasonality on oysters from southern waters due to a
lack of distinctive winter growth breaks. However, when examining modem
samples from the Texas Gulf Coast, Cox and Cox (1993) did not encounter
similar problems. If Kent’s and Russo’s difficulties were in fact related to the
difference in water temperatures between their comparative samples from the
west coast of Florida and those from the more temperate waters of the Texas Gulf
Coast, then temporal variations in water temperatures should be looked for in
archeological samples.
As mentioned above, the applicability of Kent’s (1988) seasonality technique depends on similar habitats, mostly in terms of winter water temperatures,
between the archeological sample and the modem comparative sample. This,
however, may not have always been the case, as Pielou (1991) points out that the
range for Crassostrea virginica during certain parts of the Archaic period ex-

Cox -- Oysters as Ecofacts

237

tended much farther north than it does today, indicating warmer estuarine waters
during those times along the eastern United States coast. The lowering of the
northern range for oyster began with the cooling of water temperatures in the
Late Holocene, approximately 2500 years ago (Braun 1974; Yesner 1983).
Evidence of possible paleoclimatic shifts in water temperature was looked
for in the various oyster samples from White’s Point. Through examining modem oyster samples, it was discovered that the production of distinctive winter
growth rings was to some extent related to winter water temperatures, with
colder water producing more distinctive lines (Cox and Cox 1993). Presumably,
the annuli of prehistoric oysters living in warmer waters would not be as distinct.
If this is the case, it should be evidenced in the ability of the oyster analyst to
read the umbos for seasonality.

date (from Cox and Cox 1993).

Readability of the oyster deposits from White’s Point is presented in Figure
8. If differences in water temperature are responsible for the variations in the
readability of these oysters, the data from White’s Point would seem to indicate
warmer winters in the Middle Holocene with cooler winters once again prevailing after 3000 B.P.

CHANGE IN AVERAGE HEIGHT
Oysters today along the Texas Gulf Coast reach their market size of 7.5 cm
in approximately 1.5 years (J. D. Gray, Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife,

238

Texas Archeological Society

persona! communication, 1991; see also Hofstetter 1984). After that age, most
oysters are infected by the extremely lethal protistan Perkinsus marinus, which
flourishes in the warm coastal waters of the eastern United States (Fisher et al.
1992; Mackin et al. 1950).
Table 3 presents the average heights and widths of oyster deposits from
White’s Point. The appearance of high percentages of relatively long oysters
from the upper levels of 41SP136 and 41SP153, some of which appeared to be in
excess of 10 years of age, raises the issue of how these oysters managed to avoid
the ravages of Perkinsus and similar diseases that have no effect on humans but
are very deadly to oysters (see Galtsoff 1955).
A possible explanation of this phenomenon could be that oysters in this
time period not only faced lower salinities but also perhaps lived in cooler
winter habitats, both of which combined would be effective deterrents to
Perkinsus and other diseases (Craig et al. 1989; Fisher et al. 1992; Ragone
and Burreson 1993; Soniat 1985). Independent salinity analyses show that these
oysters actually lived in more brackish environments (see Figure 7). The
possibility of lower winter temperatures is also supported by the readability
data discussed above.
A second possibility in accounting for changes in average height is overharvesting (Anderson 1981). This should be indicated by a progressive change in
shellfish size in a rapidly deposited shellfish strata (cf. Botkin 1980). No changes
were noted in the height of oysters from White’s Point, but thinness of strata was
always a limiting factor. It is at least possible that stress from overharvesting
could be identified in denser strata.
In terms of human energy expenditure, a change in height will equate to an
increase or decrease in the returns for the investment of a given amount of labor
(Bernstein 1993). This in turn has obvious implications for the relative value of
oysters to other food resources, as well as for the relative value of the estuary to
terrestrial resources.

CHANGE IN HEIGHT]WIDTH RATIOS
As can be seen from Table 3, height/width ratios of the samples from
White’s Point remained constant for approximately 4000 years and then increased slightly beginning around 3000 B.P. If these oysters all came from
similar habitats -- the bed and reef communities of the White’s Point cove
area on Nueces Bay -- the increase in height/width ratios suggests a changing environment. According to Gunter (1938) and Kent (1988), an increase in
height/width ratios would reflect denser oyster reef populations forcing more
elongated growth.
If true, then an increase would generally indicate a corresponding increase
in the exploitable biomass. At White’s Point, human populations after 3000 B.P.
most likely encountered an increasingly abundant shellfish biomass, which may

Cox ~ Oysters as Ecofacts

239

have helped precipitate a population increase. In any event, the return of humans
to the coast was probably not coincidental. An understanding of the
environmental correlates to the change in height/width ratios ca. 3000 B.P.
would provide information on an intriguing time period in the prehistory of
North America.

A MODEL OF HOLOCENE ENVIRONMENTS
AND ESTUARINE ECOLOGY
For the time period from 5500-1300 B.P., the consistency of the oyster data
from White’s Point with the known environmental data supports a predictable
model of estuarine ecology and human adaptation. Initially, with the onset of
more xeric, and probably warmer, conditions in the Middle Holocene (see Pielou
1991; Toomey et al. 1993), salinity rose in the estuary, most likely due to
reduced flow of fresh water. As barrier islands formed and the Nueces River
delta prograded, salinity levels began to fall. Higher winter temperatures are
reflected in reduced seasonality determinations on oysters toward the end of the
Middle Holocene stillstand. Oyster communities flourished during this stillstand
in the shallow, nutrient rich, brackish waters of Nueces Bay.
Human populations occupied the coast on a seasonal basis during periods of stillstand, most likely because oysters were a dependable food resource
that could be gathered during winter months when other food resources were
scarce. There are indications from the observed shucking techniques that the
coastal populations may also have been preserving this food resource for later
consumption.
With the onset of rapid sea level rise after ca. 4200 B.P., the highly productive estuarine biomass became subject to harmful marine influences. Oyster data
during the time period of approximately 4000-3000 B.P. reflect a marked increase in salinity. The inundation of the barrier islands released trapped nutrients
and increased average depth and turbidity of the estuary. While there may still
have been continued human exploitation of the estuarine biomass, it was not with
the intensity with which it occurred during stillstand.
As the climate turned more mesic and sea level reached its modern level
around 3000 B.P., the river delta once again prograded, barrier islands formed,
and salinities in the upper Nueces Bay area were progressively reduced. The
increase in lengths and height/width ratios of oysters suggests more favorable
environmental conditions. With lower salinities, much wider salinity gradients,
cooler winters, and increased primary production, oysters lived longer, the exploitable biomass was much denser, and human procurement greatly intensified.
As salinity levels continued to fall during the Late Holocene, Rangia increasingly replaced oysters as the exploitable shellfish. Then, sometime toward
the end of the Late Archaic, shellfish procurement sites along Nueces Bay were
abandoned in favor of sites along the lower estuaries and tidal passes, perhaps, as

240

Texas Archeological Society

suggested by Ricklis (1992, 1993), in response to the increased availability of
fish in those areas.
The methods discussed here offer interdisciplinary insights into estuarine
ecology throughout a large portion of the Holocene. The primary model of
human coastal adaptations was principally formulated from inferences derived
from the radiocarbon dating of estuarine shells. Other oyster analyses offer
support for the ecological and geological constructs of the model. They are not
offered as an exhaustive list, but rather as an insight into the enormous potential
of estuarine ecofacts to the field of archeology. Much of the recent scholarship
on shellfish utilization has focused on oysters, where researchers have only now
managed to scratch the surface; there are many other types of estuarine species
found in archeological middens about which very little in the archeological field
has been written.

Two Henrietta Focus Sites
on the Brazos River in
North Central Texas
R. E. Forrester

ABSTRACT
Two small excavated sites on opposite sides of the Clear Fork of the Brazos
River in North Central Texas were occupied by Late Prehistoric Henrietta
Focus people. The southern site had side-notched triangular projectile points
and their Fresno preforms. The northern site also yielded bulbar-stemmed
arrowpoints and their preforms, variants of the Cliffton "point." A small associated cemetery with poorly preserved flexed burials is also described.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this paper is not to address some abstruse Texas archeological problem and resolve it. Rather, it is to record activities performed, and
specimens gathered, by my father and myself many years ago, prior to the recognition of the need to record and retain appropriate data recovered in excavations. At that time, we were merely artifact collectors, with no understanding of
the need to keep records other than information on the county of origin of the
artifacts. Nothing vicious was intended by our actions; we were only working
with a lack of knowledge. Indeed, in those days, some professional Texas archeologists were performing little better than ourselves.
Now, more than half a century later, I present the archeological data recovered from two small excavated sites on opposite sides of the Clear Fork of
the Brazos River. The information is presented in an informal manner, as that
was the manner in which it was gathered.

Historical Background
In 1939, J.S. and J.W. Patterson, both of Moran in Shackelford County,
Texas, were hired to remove the spines on prickly pear cacti by burning. This
was an operation whereby a man carried a container of kerosene on his back with
a rubber hose leading to an iron pipe. This pipe, about five feet long, had a handle
with a trigger at the near end to control a blowtorch at the far end. The volume of
flame was controlled by the trigger, and played over the prickly pear. The spines
and glochids were burned away, leaving harmless pads.

During periods of drought at that time and place, the cacti were utilized
as food for cattle. Their spines would be burned off over large areas, and the
cattle could and would eat the nutritious pads. A second purpose was also
served: that of destroying the pestiferous cacti. Unfortunately, if the cattle later
found an area of unburned cacti, they would eat them too, having developed
a taste for the pads, but not having been bred for intelligence. The spines would
then become stuck in the nose, lips, tongue, mouth, throat, and stomachs of
the cattle, causing serious damage.
These two "pear burners" were burning off spines on some pasturage then
belonging to Mrs. George W. Elliot of Moran. The property lay on the south
side of the Clear Fork of the Brazos River, north of Breckenridge, Texas. This
was in extreme northern Stephens County, seven km northwest of Crystal Falls.
During the course of their operations, they found arrowpoints on an exposed
small, thin, sandy midden on the first terrace about 75 m from the south bank
of the Brazos River. This was in the northwest corner of Mrs. Elliot’s pasture, in the side of an old abandoned oil well slush pit. Creation of the slush
pit had destroyed a large part of the midden.
The site was reported to their kinsman, Claude Patterson, also of Moran,
and to his friend, R. E. Forrester, M.D., the writer’s father. During the summer of 1939, and at odd times later, most of the remaining midden was excavated and screened through a 1/4-inch screen, using the first mechanically
powered screen made by the Forresters. It was driven by the gasoline motor
from Mrs. Claude Patterson’s Maytag washing machine, and had to be returned
to her after each use so she could do her laundry. The speed reduction pulley
was a 21 inch wire spoke Model A Ford automobile wheel, minus the tire.
The weight of this monstrous assembly must have approached 300 pounds, as
it required a separate trailer to transport it, and at least three people to move
it about. It was tremendously rugged, and could not be bogged down by two
shovelers.
This site was given the catalog designation of F-O (later TARL designation 41SE19). Almost directly north of 41SE19, on the opposite side of the
river on the first terrace, was found a similar site eroding directly into the river.
This was designated Site F-R (41SE18) (Figure 1). This site was minimally
excavated during the pre-World War II years, but was surface collected. Some
additional excavations were performed by the author alone in 1964 and 1965.
During these excavations, cultural materials were retained if evidence of
modification was noted on any chert, shell, or bone, but debitage or bone scraps
were not collected; drum fish otoliths were kept.
This was not the case with the artifacts obtained in 1939 from 41SE18

a corresponding number in a catalog, thus permanently, recording the object’s

or kept separate from other unrelated uncataloged materials.
ARTIFACTS FROM 41SE19
Only side-notched triangular points and triangular Fresno points (Bell 1958,
1960) were found at 41SE19. The Fresno points are considered to be preforms
for the various side-notched triangular points (Figures 2 and 3).
A list of Henrietta Focus trait cultural materials (Krieger 1946; Poteet 1938;
Suhm et al. 1954) found at 41SE19 is provided in Table 1, along with a list of
expected Henrietta Focus traits that were not represented at the site. This combination of traits at 41SE19 indicates a brief Henrietta Focus occupation on the
south bank of the river, although the full complement of artifactual traits was not
found.

Burials
In 1965 and 1966, three burials were excavated approximately 75 m east of
41SE19. These are catalogued as site ARX (no TARL trinomial designation has
been obtained). Appendix 1 contains osteological data on these burials.
This cemetery was probably associated with one of the nearby midden sites.
At least three more burials were located but were not excavated. The first of the

three burials produced a side-notched triangular Washita arrowpoint (see Figure
2). Whether it represented a burial offering, or was in the body at the time of
death, is unknown. Damage from burrowing animals was severe in all three
burials.

41SE18
A distinct arrowpoint type was found at 41SE18 that differed from any
known to have come from 41SE19. This type has a stem which is bulbar or
diamond-shaped, and has long, often out-flaring, barbs (Figure 4). It resembles
the Hayes (Bell 1958, 1960) arrowpoint, although the latter is generally larger,
and also usually shows a cut-in near the tip. For purposes of this discussion only,
I will call this arrowpoint form "Lusk," in reference to a cross-road name a few
miles west. At this point, I am not prepared to offer a new formal name, due to
lack of sufficient numbers and little distributional data. Table 2 provides dimensional data on "Lusk" points.

Cliffton "arrowpoints" were found at 41SE18. By overlaying "Lusk" and
Cliffton points, it seems reasonable to suggest that the Cliffton was clearly the
preform for the "Lusk" point (Figure 5). This Cliffton variant is designated as
Cliffton II herein, to separate it from the Cliffton used as a Perdiz preform
(referred to as Cliffton I). Both Clifftons I and II have appeared in the literature
under the Cliffton name (Turner and Hester 1993:208).
To assess the validity of separating the Cliffton preforms into Types I and
II, I examined all the Clifftons recovered from Horn Shelter No. 2, which
produced Perdiz points but no side-notched triangular, Fresno, or "Lusk"
arrowpoints (Forrester n.d.), and compared them with the Clifftons from 41SE 18.
On inspecting the two Cliffton types, it is quite apparent that they differ: Cliffton
I types are deeply concave on each side of what became the stem, and are rougher
and more unfinished. On the other hand, Cliffton II specimens appear more
finished, with fine retouching present. They are trapezoidal, with two basal edges
commonly not indented, and range from 22-52 mm in length, 15-29 mm in
width, and 3-6 mm in thickness. The impression is that only diagonal basal
notches are needed to complete the "Lusk" points.
The visual differences between the two Cliffton types are so pronounced
that in a blind test I was able to match the Cliffton I and II points with their
proper areas in an excavated multicomponent site on a tributary of the Brazos
River, a few miles upstream from Granbury, Hood County, Texas. The two site
areas slightly overlap: one area bore a full Henrietta Focus set of attributes,

Figure 5. Cliffton points from 41SE 18.

256

including the "Lusk" points; the other had none of these characteristics, but had
Perdiz points. Thirty-one of the 32 Cliffton preforms were accurately assigned to
areas with either Perdiz or side-notched triangular and "Lusk" points (Prentice
Brown, personal communication, 1967).
I have found other "Lusk" points only on 41SE17, a large surface site in the
southwestern part of Stephens County. Of 181 complete or near complete
arrowpoints from that site, two were Type II Clifftons (No Type I Clifftons were
present; and only one Perdiz) and two were "Lusk" arrowpoints. These were
grouped with the Alba type in the site report (Forrester 1991). Side-notched
triangular points were present in considerable numbers (33 specimens, plus 28
Fresno preforms). The dominant arrowpoint type there was the Scallorn (N=67,
with 33 Granbury preforms).

Site Condition and Evaluation
The river is presently eroding 41SE18; the erosional destruction is a series
of gullies, rather than vertical faces caving off into the river. This made the site
difficult to excavate, and most of the excavation was done in the flat area behind
the gullies. Some artifacts were gathered from the gully slopes after they had
washed free from above; these were recorded as having been excavated.
The degree of destruction of the site by natural causes is difficult to assess;
how far the fiver has proceeded to the north since the last occupation, and how
far the site was originally located from the river edge, has not been determined.
At last examination (1966), the occupation area appeared to be no more than 6-8
cm thick, with almost that much sterile soil on top. No attempt was made to test
outlying areas to define the extent of the site. An area of roughly 3 x 3 m was
excavated and screened through a 1/4-inch sieve. Little or no occupational debris
is apparent in cross sections revealed by erosion of the river bank only a few
meters in either direction from the excavated or eroded living area. No pits were
detected. Occasional burned pieces of sandstone were encountered, hut none
appeared to form fireplaces or hearths.
41SE18 appears to have had multiple occupations based on the broad
variety of arrowpoints found at the site (Figure 6). Few characteristic Henrietta
Focus traits were recognized in the 41SE18 material culture assemblage as
compared with 41SE 19. No pipe or pipe fragments were found, nor any hematite
celts or curved knives. Whether the Type II Clifftons and the "Lusk" points were
left at the site by Henrietta Focus people, or by an unrelated group, is presently
undetermined.

Flint Sources
To the author’s knowledge, there are no outcroppings of siliceous stone
satisfactory for knapping and tool manufacture within 60 km of these two sites.

Forrester ~ Two Henrietta Focus Sites

257

Figure 6. Arrowpoints from 41SE18: top row, unclassified arrowpoints; bottom row, sidenotched triangular points.

All the stone artifacts found in these sites were examined in an attempt to
determine the origin of the lithic material. The hematite celt from 41SE19 was
probably made in the local area; that is, in the southwest part of Stephens County.
Abundant hematite cobbles outcrop in that area and a large surface site on Big
Sandy Creek has been identifed as a celt manufacturing center (Forrester 1991).
Of 253 retained siliceous stone items from both sites (and the unprovenienced
group), practically all, or possibly all, are from river gravels. The varieties are
several, but in general they are foreign to the area and of a certain distinctive
kind: commonly light tan or greyish-tan chert, occasionally of a very high quality
bluish-grey flint.
Four possible exceptions to the river gravel chert group include: (a) the tip
of a large blade (41SE18) of waxy brown chert, probably from the Edwards
Plateau area; (b) another large blade (41SE18) of dark multi-colored chert,
possibly from the Alibates quarries in the Texas Panhandle; (c) a Washita point
(41SE19) made of brownish-black chert with fine white specks; and (d) another
Washita type (41SE19) of waxy tan chert, veined with lighter tan. The source
area(s) for the Washita arrowpoints is not known.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Available data indicate that 41SE19 on the south side of the river was a
single component midden deposited by a small group of Late Prehistoric
Henrietta Focus people (e.g., Krieger 1946). The only projectile point types
present were three forms of the triangular side-notched arrowpoint and their
Fresno preforms. Other Henrietta Focus material culture traits were also present,
such as elbow pipes and a hematite celt. While not every trait of the Henrietta

258

Focus was found, those present are, as a group, considered diagnostic of that
focus (Table 3).

The cemetery, located about 75 m east of the midden at 41SE19, consisted of at least six burials, three of which were excavated. The one associated item with the burials was a Washita arrowpoint, suggesting that the burial
was also probably made by the Henrietta Focus people residing at the midden
site. All three excavated burials, and the visible portions of the other three
unexcavated ones, were similar in character: they were flexed, shallow, had
no obvious burial offerings, and were lined and covered with sandstone slabs,
some of which were visible on the ground surface.
While questionable due to extreme deterioration of the skeletal elements,
the three burials appear to have been two women in their 20s, and a man in
his mid-30s. The Washita arrowpoint was found in the grave with the younger
woman.
Site 41SE18, on the north bank of the river, was more temporally mixed
than 41SE19 since it had triangular arrowpoints, a few stemmed arrowpoints,
as well as the "Lusk" points. "Lusk" points and their preforms, Cliffton II
points, have been found in at least four other sites, all of which also had sidenotched triangular arrowpoints. One site was on Big Sandy Creek in Stephens
County (41SE17); Big Sandy Creek is a tributary of the Brazos River. The
other three sites (two surface, one rockshelter) were on the Brazos River or
on a tributary near the river. The southernmost site is a rockshelter overlooking the Brazos River in northern Hill County, Texas. "Lusk" and Clifton II
points become increasingly scarce as one progresses further downstream from
Stephens County. I speculate that there is probably some cultural affiliation
between Henrietta Focus peoples and "Lusk" arrowpoints and the Cliffton II
preform; possibly those groups that manufactured the "Lusk" arrowpoints were
a clan within the Henrietta Focus group (or groups).
Pottery was found on both sites in extremely limited amounts. A fragment of what was likely a circular gorget had been made from a potsherd at
41SE18. At 41SE19, a tiny sherd and a formed lump of fired clay were found.
All three items had shell temper, and thus were probably examples of Nocona
Plain (Krieger 1946).
Two elbow pipes of greenish sandstone were recovered, both from 41SE 19
(Figure 7). Two fragments fit together to form part of a bowl of one pipe; the
other pipe was represented by a slightly coarser variety of the stone. It had
been broken and partially dressed down at the break so that it could be used
again, probably with a stem inserted in place of the missing half. The greenish sandstone material is not found in the local vicinity.
Shell was utilized for scrapers and as a "saw" at the north bank site, and
as a gorget in the southern site. Shells of fresh water mussel were fairly common in both sites, and possibly represent one local food resource.
Otoliths from the heads of drum fish were recovered from 41SE 18; some
showed discoloration from fire. These otoliths are most resistant to decomposition, and offer good evidence that the taking of fish was practiced.

In summary, sites 41SE18 and 41SE19 on opposite sides of the Clear Fork
of the Brazos were both Henrietta Focus middens that were probably occupied
for relatively short periods. However, their association with a small cemetery
suggests a longer occupation period than was indicated simply by the sparse
recovered material remains. No evidence of agricultural pursuits was found at
either site or in their artifact assemblage, nor were any permanent houses or bellshaped storage pits observed in the excavations.

APPENDIX 1
This appendix describes the skeletal materials from three burials at site
ARX, aproximately 75 m east of 41SE19. Only Burial 1 had artifacts in association: a side-notched triangular arrowpoint found in the area of the knees.
Osteological Report: Skeletal Material from Burial 1
The skeletal material shows considerable damage due to both natural decay
of joints and spongy bone (probably minor), and attack by rodent activity (major
damage). At the time of excavation (January 1, 1965) only both innominates,
both femurs, the left tibia, and the left fibula were in place; the remaining bones
appear to have been displaced to a greater or lesser degree (Figure 8).
The following is a complete list of the recovered skeletal material:
Innominates -- right and left (both damaged)
Femurs -- right and left (both damaged)
Tibia -- left only (damaged); plus distal articular surface of tibia
Fibulae -- portion of right; nearly complete left
Calcaneus -- fight only (damaged)

present in situ.

Ulna -- left only; proximal end only
Humerus -- left only; missing proximal end
Radius -- left only; missing proximal end
Vertebra -- neural arch of one thoracic or cervical vertebra
Phalange -- distal half of one foot or hand phalange

Mandible -- right half only
Calvarium -- consists of frontal, parietals, occipital (all damaged)
Teeth -- two loose teeth found; upper left incisor; third molar, left side
Fragments -- six or eight very small fragments not positively identified.
Innominates: Right and left both present; sacrum noted absent. The iliac
crests, pubic bones, sciatic tubers, and obturator foramina are missing from each
innominate. No rodent gnawing is visible. Shape of the greater sciatic notches
would indicate female status; general small size of remaining portions also
indicates a female.

262

Texas Archeological Society

Femurs: Both present, neither broken. Each shows rodent gnawing which
becomes progressively worse distally. Each is missing the distal end, from about
the capsular line. The lesser trochanters are both missing, but by decay rather
than by non-fusion. The greater trochanter is present on the right femur only.
Both heads are present and fused (fuses in 19th year according to Shaeffer
[1951]). Platymerism is not evident. Pilastering of linea aspera is present to a
moderate degree. General appearance of the femorae indicates femininity.
Tibia: Left only is present, plus lower articular surface of the right tibia. In
the tibia present, the proximal articular surface is missing. Its lower articular
surface (distal end) is well fused. The separate lower articular surface from the
missing right tibia is neatly separated at the epiphyseal line. (The upper extremity
fuses about the 20th year; the lower at about 18 years.) It was impossible to
establish if any of the missing surfaces are due to decay or to lack of fusion. If
due to lack of fusion, then age would be about 19 years, based on tibiae alone.
Only a minor amount of rodent gnawing is present.
Fibula: Left fibula almost complete; missing estimated 15 mm. Remaining
portion is 313 mm. Missing end is the proximal. At least part of the damage is
due to rodent gnawing. Shaft is badly gnawed by rodents. Mid-section only is
present from right fibula; remainder was destroyed by rodent activity.
CaIcaneus: From right foot. Lateral surface has been destroyed by decay.
No rodent gnawing is visible. Epiphysis is fused.
Ulna: Proximal half of left ulna present; gnawed through by rodents. Olecranon is missing; coronoid process is present.
Humerus: Left humerus only; complete save for missing head, and the
greater and lesser tubercles. Severely gnawed all over by rodents. A large
supratrochlear foramen (septal aperture) exists at distal end.
Radius: Severely damaged distal end of left radius only. Fused epiphysis
(fusion occurs at 18th to 20th year).
Vertebra: One neural arch from a probable cervical or thoracic vertebra;
spinous process missing; arch is detached from body.
Phalange: Distal half of a phalange from either a hand or a foot.
Temporal Bone: Right temporal bone; squamous portion missing. Some
other decay evident; no gnawed areas visible.
Maxilla: Right maxilla only; fused with right zygoma. Zygoma is gnawed
by rodents; the frontal process of maxilla is destroyed by gnawing. Teeth are
present in alvolar area.
All eight teeth (normal for maxilla) were present at death; the central
incisor, canine, and first premolar are now missing. Of the remaining teeth: the
third molar (wisdom) has a cavity in grinding surface and another at gum line
next to second molar; there is a small "pearl" attached below the gum line to the
lateral surface of the third molar. The second molar has a similar "pearl" on its
lateral surface, plus another "pearl" at the base of a large cavity which faces
backward toward the matching cavity in the third molar. The first molar is
represented only by a stump sitting in its socket. This stump is mostly the root of

Forrester -- Two Henrietta Focus Sites

263

the first molar with a small amount of enamel remaining. The remaining premolar
(end premolar) is not diseased, nor is the remaining lateral incisor. Wear is quite
evident, but not excessive considering the age and dietary habits of the individual.
Mandible: Slightly more than half of the right half of the mandible is
present. The ramus is badly gnawed, as is the mental protuberance. The sockets
exist for a total of 12 teeth; this is the entire right side plus the two left incisors,
left canine and 1st premolar. Of these left four, only the lateral incisor is present.
Apparently all teeth were present at death, although the sockets of the two central
incisors, now missing, show a diseased condition. Of the normal eight teeth on
the right side, all are present save the two incisors. There is only one cavity
present in the existing teeth in the mandible section, it being in the grinding
surface of the third molar (wisdom tooth). The general appearance of the mandible is feminine.
Calvarium: The calvarium consists of the entire frontal bone, most of the
right and left parietals, and a small portion of the occipital, including the superior
angle. A large Wormian bone (preinterparietal) exists at the junction of the two
parietals and the occipital (lambda).
The occipital is gnawed almost entirely away; the fight parietal is gnawed
away at the mastoid angle, at sphenoid and temporal squama articulations. The
frontal bone is gnawed on both supraorbital borders and both zygomatic processes, and on the left nasal part. The orbital plates are missing. The coronal
suture closure has begun; the sagittal and sphenoidal sutures are in the process of
closing. The remaining portions of the lambdoid suture are partly closed. Age
would thus be estimated at around 25 years. The minimum frontal breadth is 87
mm; this seems markedly small for an adult, and so the skull appears when
viewed from the front. The calvarium is not marked by heavy muscle attachment
areas, indicating this is a female.
Teeth: Two loose teeth were found: the upper left incisor, and a third molar
from the left side; neither showed cavities.
Fragments: Six or eight very small fragments of bone, not positively identified as to source.
Based on the skeletal evidence discussed above, Burial 1 is that of a woman,
with slight build, about 22-25 years of age at death. Other than dental disease, no
bone diseases were noted.
Osteological Report: Skeletal Material from Burial 2
The skeletal material from Burial 2 shows tremendous damage due to both
natural decay of joints and spongy bone, and to attack by rodent activity. The
vast majority of the skeleton was missing entirely. Excavation (February 7,
1965) exposed the major portion of the left femur and some of the left (?) tibia in
its apparent burial position (fully flexed). The mandible, minus both rami, lay on
the same level, with the maxilla directly over it, touching at the dental areas. In

264

Texas Archeological Society

its appropriate anatomical position, the right temporal bone lay behind and to the
fight of the mandible and maxilla. A very few pieces of other bones were
scattered at random in the pit fill (Figure 9).

AI

"~fr

Figure 9. Site ARX: Burial 2. Sketch of Burial as seen from above, all major bones in situ.

The few bones remaining would indicate that the body was laid on the left
side, fully flexed, with the head to the east. The skull as found must have been
dislocated by rodents.
The long bones (tibia and femur) were too damaged to provide information
other than that the individual was an adult. The mandible, missing its rami, offers
the most useful data: the individual was fully adult, robust, and probably male.
The teeth exhibit no cavities, but there are indications of alveolar disease, especially in the maxilla. All four wisdom teeth are present; the total wear on all
grinding surfaces is consistent with an individual about 35 years old.
Osteological Report: Skeletal Material from Burial 3
This skeletal material shows marked damage due to natural decay of joints
and spongy bone, and to attack by rodents. Most of the skeleton was missing
entirely, but excavation (May 15, 1966) showed the tibiae and femorae to be in
flexed position, left femur uppermost, thus indicating the body lay on its right

side; the head was probably to the west. The cranium was west of the legs, but
almost surely not in burial position. The burial was lined and covered with
sandstone slabs. No long bone was complete enough for height estimations. All
teeth were missing from the maxilla (postmortem loss); one tooth (lower right
canine) was found loose in the grave fill (Figure 10).
Calvarium -- complete except for loss of all teeth and some rodent-gnawed
areas. Cephalic index: 184/137 x 10 = 74.3 (barely within dolichocephalic range).
Calvarium is in good preservation, except for rodent-gnawing, and fairly recent
temporal bone damage due to rock pressure.

Dofia Ana Phase Ceramics and Cultural
Evolution in the Southern
Jornada Mogollon

Robert J. Hard, Pamela Graeber, Jimmie Manasco,
Cynthia Tennis, and Kevin Thuesen

ABSTRACT
The Dofia Ana phase (A.D. 1100-1200) in the southern Jornada Mogolton
region, in the vicinity of E1 Paso, Texas, represents a transitional period linking a dominantly hunting and gathering adaptation with a more agrarian one;
yet, it has remained enigmatic since its definition by Lehmer (1948). Problems
identifying Dofia Ana phase sites, and understanding the nature of the cultural
adaptation they represent, have persisted due to the lack of systematically
analyzed excavation data. An analysis of the ceramic assemblage excavated
from the Hueco Tanks Dofia Aria phase site (Kegley 1982), and comparisons
with Mesi!la and E1 Paso phase sites, indicate that vessel form and function
were rapidly evolving in response to shifting adaptations. A frequency seriation
of ceramic assemblages should aid in the recognition of Dofia Ana phase sites
on survey as well.

INTRODUCTION
In 1972 and 1973, George Kegley (1982) excavated site 41EP2 in Hueco
Tanks State Park for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The site represents one of the few Dofia Ana phase (A.D. 1100-1200) occupations which have
been excavated and published. Recent issues regarding this critical period have
arisen which are addressed here by a reanalysis of the ceramic collections from
the Hueco Tanks site.
Hueco Tanks State Park is located at the base of the Hueco Mountains
about 50 km east of E1 Paso on the edge of the Hueco Bolson. The Hueco Tanks
are a series of water-holding rock basins in an igneous formation that juts up
from the desert floor (Figure 1). These sheltered rock basins were a critical
source of water for both prehistoric and historic populations since moisture is
held long after the rainy season ends. The hundreds of pictographs and numerous archeological sites in the park attest to the significance of the area for aboriginal populations.

text.
Kegley’s (1982) report describes the excavation of six rectangular pithouses,
four interior trash-filled pits, and four burials and other associated features.
Based on a single radiocarbon date (A.D. 1150 + 50), the ceramic assemblage,
and architectural style, Kegley suggested that the site represented a single component Dofia Ana phase occupation.
During the Mesilla phase (A.D. 300-1100), E1 Paso Brown was the local
pottery, and house forms included both huts and pithouses (Lehmer 1948;
Whalen 1981a; Hard 1983a). The subsistence economy was primarily based
upon hunting and gathering with a relatively minor use of maize (Whalen 1981a;
Hard 1983b). Mesilla phase sites are found in a variety of ecological zones, and
there is evidence for residential use of the desert basins, as well as the riverine
and mountain foothill zones. Populations apparently engaged in a substantial
amount of residential mobility (Whalen 1981a; Hard 1983b).
The Dofia Ana phase developed from the Mesilla phase. Lehmer (1948)
suggested, based upon limited data, that the ceramics for the phase consisted of
about 50 percent E1 Paso Brown and 50 percent E1 Paso Polychrome. Dofia Ana
phase E1 Paso Polychrome rim treatments included direct thickened, direct

Hard et al, ~ DoKa Ana Phase Ceramics

269

unthickened, and everted forms. Whalen (1978, 1981b) formalized the
recognition of variability within E1 Paso Polychrome and characterized early
variant E1 Paso Polychrome rims as being slightly thickened with vertical necks
and rims. Rim flattening was also common. Way (1979) and Whalen (t981b)
dated early E1 Paso Polychrome ceramics from A.D. 1100-1250, roughly
contemporaneous with the Dofia Ana phase.
Dofia Ana phase intrusive wares included: Mimbres Classic Black-onwhite, San Francisco Red, Alma Plain, Mimbres Corrugated, Chupadero Blackon-white, Three Rivers Red-on-terracota, and St. Johns Polychrome. Both
pithouses and surface structures were present (Lehmer 1948; Schaafsma 1990).
The Dofia Ana phase also linked the more mobile hunting and gathering adaptation of the Mesilla phase with the reduced residential mobility and increased
use of maize in the E1 Paso phase.
During the E1 Paso phase (A.D. 1200-1400), a number of architectural
forms were present, including huts, pithouses, individual detached surface
rooms, adobe pueblos, and a large well (Batcho et al. 1985; Carmichael 1986;
Thomas O’Laughlin, personal communication 1992; Scarborough 1988). Pueblos range in size from a few rooms to more than 100. Maize played a dominant
role in the subsistence base, although wild foods remained important. E1 Paso
phase residential sites cluster into core areas located at the toes of the alluvial
fans in Tularosa Valley and the Hueco Bolson and are found along the Rio
Grande as well. Residential mobility appears to have substantially decreased and
populations increased (Whalen 198 lb).
The local ceramic ware was E1 Paso Polychrome, and the unpainted E1 Paso
Brown disappeared from the assemblage (Lehmer 1948). Lehmer (1948) noted
that rims were everted, thickened, or everted and thickened. Whalen (1978,
1981b) described late variant E1 Paso Polychrome rims as having pronounced
thickening and being flared outward about 20 degrees. The jars were constricted
at the neck, rather than at the mouth. The late variant of E1 Paso Polychrome
was widely used after A.D. 1250 (Way 1979; Whalen 1981b). The principal
intrusive types included: Chupadero Black-on-white, Three Rivers Red-onterracota, Lincoln Black-on-red, Ramos Polychrome, St. Johns Polychrome, and
Playas Red Incised.
Since the temporal phases are defined on the basis of ceramic and architectural stylistic criteria, adaptational shifts within phases are not clearly detectable, but are probably present nonetheless. There appear to be clear adaptational
differences between the phases that are useful to explore for various purposes.
The nature of the adaptation during the Dofia Ana phase has remained problematic, principally because few Dofia Ana phase sites have been excavated, and
simply recognizing Dofia Ana phase sites during survey remains problematic.
With these problems in mind, we recently reanalyzed the Hueco Tanks
ceramic collection. First, Kegley’s chronological placement of 41EP2 in the
Dofia Ana phase is reexamined, followed by an analysis of the local rim sherds,
and finally the results are placed within a larger regional context.

CHRONOLOGICAL PLACEMENT

Kegley (1982) reported a single uncorrected radiocarbon date of A.D. 1150
+ 50 from a piece of wood charcoal from House i. The local ceramic types
present were E1 Paso Brown, El Paso Bichrome, and E1 Paso Polychrome. The
intrusive types included Chupadero Black-on-white, Mimbres Black-on-white,
Playas Red, Wingate Black-on-red, St. Johns Polychrome, Three Rivers Redon-terracota, Ramos Polychrome, and a corrugated ware.
Our reanatysis, using Scott’s (1983:45-67) descriptions, indicated all of the
Mimbres sherds were either Style II, III, indeterminate II/III, or unknown. Style
II dates from before A.D. 950 until just after A.D. 1000. Style III begins in the
early eleventh century and continues to the abandonment of the Mimbres Valley about A.D. 1150 (Scott 1983). Fifty-nine Mimbres sherds were examined:
two were Style II, 25 were Style III, 10 were Style II/III, and 22 were unknown.
This distribution supports an occupation of the Hueco Tanks site during Style
III times.
A number of researchers have suggested that Mimbres Black-on-white
continued to be manufactured in the Jornada area after the Mimbres Valley was
abandoned. This brings into question the utility of the Mimbres Valley chronology for cross-dating Mimbres Black-on-white found in the Jornada area (Brody
1977; Rugge 1988; Wiseman 1982). Indeed, Rugge (1988) demonstrated with
petrographic analyses that Mimbres ceramics found in the Tularosa Valley and
the Hueco Bolson were produced outside of the Mimbres Valley, some probably
in the Rio Grande Valley. However, data from a recently excavated pithouse site
at Ft. Bliss suggests that the termination date of Mimbres Black-on-white in the
southern Jornada area must be close to A.D. 1150. The Meyer Pithouse Village
site was reliably dated to between A.D. 1150-1200 with a series of
archeomagnetic and radiocarbon dates, yet the site contained no Mimbres ceramics among a collection of 13,000 sherds (Scarborough 1989). This site indicates
that production of Mimbres ceramics in the area did not continue much beyond
A.D. 1150.
The occurrence of Mimbres Black-on-white with Chupadero Black-onwhite in the Jornada area raises a number of related issues since the ending
date of Mimbres Black-on-white, as well as the beginning date of Chupadero,
has been difficult to precisely define. Do such proveniences represent the late
manufacture of Mimbres Black-on-white, multiple occupations, or twelfth
century occupations?
Mimbres Black-on-white and Chupadero sherds were clearly associated
at the Hueco Tanks site. Out of 52 proveniences with Mimbres Black-on-white
sherds, 46 contained Chupadero, including at least one from a floor context.
Chupadero Black-on-white and Mimbres Black-on-white have also been found
in association in the Sacramento Mountains (Hayes 1981:71-72; Wiseman
1982:6), in the Mimbres Valley at the Swarts Ruin (Cosgrove and Cosgrove
1932), and in the Palomas drainage (Nelson 1992). Wiseman (1982) concludes

Hard et al. ~ DoRa Ana Phase Ceramics

271

that A.D. 1100 is a reasonable beginning date for Chupadero Black-on-white;
apparently associations between Chupadero and Mimbres Black-on-white ceramics are valid, and represent early to mid-twelfth century occupations.
A small number of White Mountain Redware sherds was found at the
Hueco Tanks site. Five sherds of Wingate Black-on-red and four sherds of St.
Johns Polychrome were identified based on comparisons with Carlson (1970).
Wingate Black-on-red dates between A.D. t050-1200, with the greatest frequency occurring after A.D. 1100 (Carlson 1970). St. Johns Polychrome occurs between A.D. 1175-1300 (Carlson 1970:39-41). One sherd of St. Johns
Polychrome was found in an excavated provenience with a Mimbres Style III
sherd at the Hueco Tanks site. St. Johns Polychrome was found as welt at the
Swarts Ruin in the Mimbres Valley, indicating that this type may occur slightly
earlier than Carlson’s estimate. In fact, the Second Ceramic Conference at the
Museum of Northern Arizona placed the beginning date for St. Johns Polychrome at A.D. 1150 (Hayes 1981:72).
Myles Miller (personal communication 1994) of the Ft. Bliss Archaeology
Program submitted 14 radiocarbon samples to Beta Analytic Inc. from the Hueco
Tanks site, including five normal wood samples and nine AMS samples of shortlived species. The tree-ring calibrated dates were distributed as follows: one in
the ninth century, one in the tenth century, four in the eleventh century, seven
in the twelfth century, and one in the thirteenth century.
The pooled mean, the variance of the pooled mean, and the T statistic
for the 14 uncalibrated dates, were calculated using Wilson and Ward (1978)
with the 50 year calibration error added to the laboratory counting error. The
pooled mean date is A.D. 1000 + 35 and T=5.5, with a chi-square value of
22.4 for 13 degrees of freedom. At the .05 significance level, the 14 dates
appear to be statistically similar. The tree-ring calibrated mean date at one
sigma is cal A.D. 1026 (1041, 1150) 1161, and at two sigma is cal A.D. 1015
(1041, 1150) 1180. The probability distributions at one sigma are cal A.D.
1030-1058 (p=.3), 1080-1124 (p=.47), and 1136-1157 (p=.23); at two sigma
they are cal A.D. 1017-1170 (p=l.0) (Stuiver and Reimer 1993).
Taking all the ceramic and chronological data into account, the occupation of the Hueco Tanks site most likely between A.D. 1075-1150. The ceramic and radiocarbon data support one another, except there are several dates
which fall outside of the expected range. The dates further suggest the occupation span may have extended to the late 1100’s.

ANALYSIS
Our analysis of the Hueco Tanks pottery considers only the 448 rims of
E1 Paso Brown, E1 Paso Bichrome, and E1 Paso Polychrome. The sample of
rims consists of 21 percent E1 Paso Brown (unpainted), 26 percent E1 Paso

272

Texas Archeological Society

Bichrome (either a red or black paint on a brown paste), and 53 percent E1
Paso Polychrome (red and black on brown) (Stallings 1931; Lehmer 1948).
This repesents one of the largest collections of brownware rims analyzed from
a single excavated site in the region. The collection is particularly useful for
verifying the seriation of local wares (Lehmer 1948; Whalen 1981b); for the
consideration of vessel forms and functions; and for diachronic comparisons.
The principal variables analyzed for each rim included: pottery type, vessel
form, rim diameter, rim direction, and the rim sherd index (RSI)--a quantified measurement of rim finish.
Three vessel forms are present: tecomates, bowls, and necked jars; no ladles
or miniature vessels were identified in this collection. The 448 rim sherds include
9 percent tecomates, 30 percent bowls, 51 percent jars, and 10 percent of unknown form.
Exterior rim diameter was only measured on sherds with a chord length (a
straight line measured between the two ends of the rim) greater or equal to 1.5
cm; 313 rims met this requirement. The mean diameter of all rims is 20 cm.
There is little difference in mean diameters among the three vessel forms:
tecomates, 18.3 cm (sd=6.1 cm, n--32); bowls, 20.8 cm (sd=4.4 cm, n=95); and
jars, 20.2 cm (sd=6.5 cm, n=186).
Rim direction categories used were inverted, direct, and everted (Figure 2).
The most commonly observed rim direction was direct, comprising 90 percent of
the sample. Everted rims accounted for 7 percent, inverted rims 1.5 percent, and
1.3 percent were of unknown rim direction. The high frequency of direct rims is
characteristic of the early variant of E1 Paso Polychrome (Whalen 198 lb).
The Rim Sherd Index, or RSI, was developed by West (1982) to quantify
rim thickening. The RSI was determined by measuring wall thickness 2 mm
below the lip and 15 mm below the lip. The lower measurement is then divided
into the upper measurement. Rims with an RSI less than 1.0 are tapered, RSIs of
approximately 1.0 are straight, and rims with values greater than 1.0 are wedged.
The mean RSI is 1.09 (sd=0.27) on a sample of 370 measureable rims,
indicating that most rims are slightly wedged. The RSIs for each pottery type
indicate that E1 Paso Brown has the smallest value at 0.97, E1 Paso Bichrome has
an intermediate value of 1.06, and E1 Paso Polychrome has an RSI of 1.12. The
early variant E1 Paso Polychrome shows the most thickening of the three
brownwares in this assemblage.
A comparison of RSI by vessel form shows that both necked jars and bowls
have similar RSIs of 1.12 and 1.09, respectively. Tecomates, however, have a
mean RSI of 0.95, indicating they have more tapered rims than the other forms.
Both direct and inverted rims have slight thickening based on their similar RSIs
of 1.08 (n=312) and 1.09 (n=7), respectively. However, everted rims have more
pronounced wedging since they have a mean RSI of 1.21 (n=25). Everted rims
and pronounced wedging occur together as rim treatment patterns.

COMPARISONS
Our analyses are relevant to two issues: (1) the recognition of Dofia Ana
phase sites on surface survey, and (2) Dofia Ana phase adaptations in comparison
to earlier and later phases. Data from four other excavated sites are considered
here, the Mesilla phase Conejo site (Hard 1988); the Dofia Ana phase Meyer
Pithouse Village (Scarborough 1989); the Dofia Ana Godernadora site (Mi!ler
1989); and the E1 Paso phase Firecracker Pueblo (O’Laughlin, personal communication 1992).
The Conejo site is located in the rainfall runoff zone nine km east of the
Organ Mountains and one kin west of the large Old Coe Lake playa in Dofia Ana
County, New Mexico, on Ft. Bliss. The radiocarbon dates primarily cluster in the

274

Texas Archeological Society

ninth century A.D. Excavations identified four circular pithouses, an additional
single large pithouse which may be a communal structure, an exterior trash
midden, and numerous interior and exterior pits. The subsistence base included
substantial reliance on wild plants, a heavy emphasis on lagomorphs, and minor
use of maize and beans (Hard 1988).
The Meyer Pithouse Village is located on Meyers Range on Ft. Bliss in
Otero County, New Mexico, about six km west of the Hueco Mountains in a
rainfall runoff zone. Three quadrilateral pithouses (which averaged 6.4 mz in
size) and a large (over 20 m2), probable communal structure were excavated
(Scarborough 1989). The site was well dated to A.D. 1150-1200. Substantial
quantities of both wild and domesticated species of charred plant remains were
recovered.
The Gobernadora site (41EP321) is located six km east of. the Franklin
Mountains, immediately north of the E1 Paso city limits, in a rainfall runoff zone.
A series of 30 radiocarbon dates suggests that the site was occupied between
A.D. 1050-1250, and it is considered to be a Dofia Ana phase occupation (Miller
1989). Four quadrilateral pithouses, a midden, a burial, numerous exterior firecracked rock features, and pits were excavated at the site. Ethnobotanical samples
recovered high frequencies of wild plant resources while the recovery of maize
was remarkedly low.
Firecracker Pueblo is located in the Hueco Bolson approximately 10 km
east of the Franklin Mountains in the rainfall runoff zone in E1 Paso County,
Texas, just outside of Ft. Bliss. The chronometric dates indicate the occupation
began about A.D. 1300 and continued to the mid-or late 1300s, all well within
the E1 Paso phase (O’Laughlin, personal communication 1992). Sixteen or 17
pithouses, including a large, possible communal room, were Overlaid by a pueblo.
Eighteen to 20 pueblo rooms were present, along with over 400 extra-mural
features. Numerous maize remains were recovered at the pueblo, as well as
evidence for use of an array of wild resources.

COMPARISONS WITH OTHER DO~4A ANA PHASE SITES
Until recently, there had been insufficient excavated data available to conduct a frequency seriation of Dofia Ana phase brownwares. The brownware rim
frequencies from Hueco Tanks, Meyer Pithouse, and the Gobernadora site are
listed in Table 1. The frequencies from the Hueco Tanks and Meyer Pithouse
Village sites are similar, while the Goberuadora frequencies are lower in E1 Paso
Bichrome and higher in E1 Paso Polychrome. However, Miller (1989) notes that
some sherds which were originally classified as E1 Paso Bichrome, were reclassified as E1 Paso Polychrome with eroded red designs. This reclassification could
account for the differences between Gobernadora and the other two Dofia Ana
phase sites. Whatever the case, there appears to be a pattern to the frequency
seriation for the Dofia Ana phase: E1 Paso Brown comprises 20-25 percent of the

The 216 rim sherds from the Gobernadora site have a mean RSI of 1.02
(Miller 1989), while the mean RSI on 370 sherds from Hueco Tanks is 1.08; the
two collections have clearly similar RSI. The Dofia Ana phase RSIs indicate that
some rim wedging is present.

absent; by the Dofia Ana phase, E1 Paso Polychrome dominates and E1 Paso
Brown and Bichrome have roughly equal frequencies. By the E1 Paso phase, E1
Paso Brown and Bichrome have disappeared. Although O’Laughlin (personal
communication, 1992) found three rim sherds of E1 Paso Brown at Firecracker,
they are not associated with the E1 Paso phase occupation. These data quantify
the conventionally accepted, although not well documented, seriation. Note particularly.that E1 Paso Brown is completely absent by the 1300s in the E1 Paso
phase (cf. Seaman and Mills 1988).
O’Laughlin (personal communication, 1992) calculated a mean RSI of 1.42
(sd=0.35) on a collection of 780 rims from Firecracker Pueblo. This is similar to
a collection of 69 E1 Paso phase rims (RSI=l.35) from a surface survey at White
Sands Missile Range (Seaman and Mills 1988). The RSI increases from slightly
more than 1.0 on the early variant of E1 Paso Polychrome present during the
twelfth century Dofia Ana phase, to about 1.40 on the late variant E1 Paso
Polychrome in the fourteenth century E1 Paso phase. Increasing RSI indicates
substantially more pronounced wedging during the E1 Paso phase.
Changes in vessel form frequencies are evident across the three phases
(Table 3). The proportion of necked jars steadily increases from less than 30
percent in the Mesilla phase to more than 75 percent in the E1 Paso phase. Bowls
decline from almost 40 percent in the Mesilla phase to about 20 percent in the E1
Paso phase. Tecomates sharply decline, and by the E1 Paso phase they .are
nonexistent. The Firecracker Pueblo rim assemblage was similar to one small
(n=69) surface collection of painted E1 Paso phase rims (Seaman and Mills
1988:Table 13.6): 23 percent bowls, 75 percent jars, and 1.4 percent tecomates.
By the El Paso phase, necked jars had become the dominant form and had totally
replaced tecomates in the assemblage.
Comparisons of mean rim diameters from the C0nejo, Hueco Tanks, and
Firecracker sites are presented in Table 4. Bowl diameters increased substantially
between the Mesilla and Dofia Ana phases, from 14.3 cm to 20.8 cm, but

increased only slightly between the Mesilla and Dofia Ana phases, 18.4 cm to
20.2 cm, but increased to 27.6 cm in diameter in the E1 Paso phase. Whalen
(198 lb) noted a similar trend in a collection of 20 necked jar rims from the E1
Paso phase that had an average diameter of 25.8 cm. Tecomates slightly increased in size between the Mesilta and Dofia Ana phases, and dropped out of
ceramic assemblages by the E1 Paso phase.

In sum, jars dominated the assemblage and sharply increased in size by the
time of the E1 Paso phase. The vessel assemblage was evolving as part of a
technology responding to shifting adaptations. However, in order to understand
these adaptations, improvements are still needed in our ability to recognize Dofia
Ana phase sites on archeological survey.

DISCUSSION
The identification of Dofia Ana phase sites on surface survey has remained
problematic. Many surveys have not attempted to identify Dofia Ana phase sites
(Seaman and Doleman 1988; Skelton et al. 1981; Whalen 1977, 1978). Other
surveys identified Dofia Ana phase sites based on the co-occurrence of a number
of ceramic types (Beckes et al. 1977; Carmichael 1986). For example,
Carmichael (1986:71-72) used the occurrence of E1 Paso Brown, E1 Paso Polychrome, Mimbres Black-on-white, and Chupadero Black-on-white together on
surface survey to identify Dofia Ana phase sites. However, multi-component
sites with both Mesilla and E1 Paso phase occupations would produce similar
ceramic assemblages.
Problems in phase identification have led to substantial differences in understanding long term cultural changes in the region. Whalen (1981 a) proposed a

278

Texas Archeological Society

gradualist model suggesting that the E1 Paso phase represented the peak in
population density, aggregation, and agricultural dependence in the southern
Jornada Mogollon. Carmichael (1986, 1990), on the other hand, proposed a
cyclical model in which the Dofia Ana phase represented a peak in population,
followed by a decline, followed by either a continued decline or a second peak.
The cyclic model is based upon the identification of a greater number of residential sites as belonging to the Dofia Ana phase rather than the E1 Paso phase in the
Tularosa Valley portions of Ft. Bliss.
Improved accuracy in the recognition of Dofia Ana phase sites in the Hueco
Bolson and southern Tularosa Valley during surface survey may now be possible
with a rim frequency seriation. Based upon the ceramic analyses discussed
above, Dofia Ana phase sites should contain: 20-25 percent E1 Paso Brown, 1025 percent El Paso Bichrome, and 50-70 percent E1 Paso Polychrome. Early rims
of E1 Paso Polychrome (rims which are largely, direct and with RSIs slightly
greater than 1.0) should dominate.
An E1 Paso phase site assemblage overlying a Mesilla phase assemblage
would not produce a similar ceramic pattern, since E1 Paso Bichrome is rare both
during the ninth century portion of the Mesilla phase, and in the E1 Paso phase. In
addition, the late variant E1 Paso Polychrome with everted and strongly wedged
rim treatment should dominate on E1 Paso phase sites. The rims from Firecracker
Pueblo indicate the late rim variant dominated by the 1300s. Way (1979) and
Whalen (198 lb) both suggested an ending date of A.D. 1250 for the early variant
of E1 Paso Polychrome.
In the future, analyses of excavated assemblages from the later part of the
Mesilla phase and early part of the E1 Paso phase may enable further refinement
of this seriation. The occurrence of Style III Mimbres Black-on-white, in association with early variant E1 Paso Polychrome or Chupadero Black-on-white, is
also a reliable indicator of the Dofia Ana phase. However, the absence of Mimbres
Black-on-white does not necessarily indicate that a site does not belong to the
Dofia Ana phase, as this intrusive ware only occurs in small amounts and it is
apparently absent after the mid-twelfth century.
Identification of Dofia Ana phase sites during surface survey is possible, but
must depend upon both a reliable ceramic collection and sampling strategy, so
that laboratory analyses and quantifiable results can be obtained on appropriate
sample sizes. Sites with few rim sherds will remain problematic without samples
for chronometric dating.
Our comparisons indicate that necked jars both increased in frequency and
size in the Dofia Ana phase and then further increased in the E1 Paso phase;
necked jars had replaced tecomates by this time as well. What was the function
or functions of these necked jars? The principal candidates are: water storage,
cookpots, dry food storage, or multiple uses.
The necked jars are restricted in that the orifice diameter is less than the
body diameter. The degree of vessel restriction reflects a tradeoff between acces-

sibility and containment security. According to research by Mills (1989) and
Smith (1985), water storage vessels tend to be characterized by small orifices
which reduced spillage.
The orifice diameters on the Dofia Ana and E1 Paso phase necked jars,
on average, are too large to be effective water storage vessels. However, restricted vessels with orifice diameters in the range of the Hueco Tanks jars
were commonly used to boil large quantities of food. Restricted vessels with
medium to large orifices are suitable cookpots as they provide access, and
reduce boil-over or spillage. Necked jars with medium to large orifices are,
however, also used for dry food storage. Mills (1989) found that vessels in
her archeological sample from the northern Anasazi area that were used as
food storage were actually recycled cookpots. The senior author has observed
a similar pattern among the Rar~imuri (Tarahumara) in northern Chihuahua;
vessels used to store seed corn, clothing, and pinole were frequently recycled
cooking jars. The most likely function of most of the E1 Paso Brownware
necked jars was as cookpots. There is one problem with this explanation-Mills (1989) reports that Anasazi cookpots are usually undecorated, since
sooting would rapidly cover the decoration. The E1 Paso Polychrome decorations are, however, limited to the upper one-third of the vessel, which would
tend to escape sooting.
If these necked jars were cookpots, what were they cooking? A number of
independent lines of evidence suggest that maize consumption increased between the Mesilla and E1 Paso phases. Settlement pattern data indicate that E1
Paso phase residential sites are more clustered in the better watered areas in
rainfall runoff zones than Mesilla phase residential sites (Whalen 1978, 1981a).
Macrobotanical recovery of maize is usually high at E1 Paso phase residential
sites but low on Mesilla phase sites (Whalen 1981a; Hard 1988; O’Laughlin,
personal communication 1992). Mano length, a proxy index of the importance of
maize, also increased between the Mesilla and E1 Paso phases (Hard 1990).
Whalen (1981a) presented evidence that population increased between the
Mesilla and E1 Paso phases as well.
One of the principal methods of preparing maize is steeping or boiling it for
several hours in order to break down the complex starch (Braun 1983; Hard
1986). Some of the necked jars would likely have been used this way as their
shape, size, and increased frequency are suggestive of a cooking pot function.
Their increased frequency may be a result of either an actual increase in the
number of pots in use in a household, and/or the high breakage rates that cooking
pots suffer. Since Dofia Ana phase jar size and frequency falls between the
Mesilla and E1 Paso phases, it would suggest that the gradualist rather than the
cyclical model is best supported by the ceramic assemblage data. Based on
changes in ceramic vessel forms, it appears that the peak in agricultural production occurred during the E1 Paso, not the Dofia Ana, phase in the southern
Jornada Mogollon region.

Personnel at Texas Parks and Wildlife, particularly Marybeth Tomka, were
generous in allowing us to borrow the Hueco Tanks ceramic collections. Because
George Kegley and his crew conducted a professional excavation and study of
the Hueco Tanks site and left the collections and documentation in good condition, we were able to undertake this reanalysis with little difficulty. The students
in the UTSA Anthropology Laboratory class in the summer of 1992 assisted with
the analyses of these sherds. Tom O’Laughlin graciously shared his unpublished

The Canyon Creek Site (41OC13):
A Component of the Southern
Plains Equestrian Nomad
Archeological Complex
Harry J. Shafer, John E. Dockall, Douglas W. Owsley,
and Thomas S. Ellzey

ABSTRACT
The Canyon Creek site is an historic Plains Indian child burial, with
associated material items, discovered in a fissure cave in Ochiltree County,
Texas. The burial contained the accoutrements of mid-nineteenth century horse
nomad culture, placing it in the broader context of Native American equestrian
cultures of the Southern Plains. Topics treated include determining tribal
identity, dating, and defining the Southern Plains equestrian nomad
archeological complex. This unique material complex was created through
mutual interaction between Native Americans, and the Spanish, French, and
Anglo-Americans.

INTRODUCTION

This paper describes a mid-nineteenth century equestrian nomad burial and
associated artifacts excavated from a small solution cave (41OC13) on a tributary of Wolf Creek in Ochiltree County, Texas. A comparative study of like finds
in the Southern Plains of Texas and Oklahoma shows that a distinctive Southern
Plains Indian materia! complex grew out of the adoption of equestrian technology and European trade by many native groups (Kroeber 1963:76-80).
The archeology of Late Historic Native American culture (1800-1875) in
the Southern High Plains consists of two complimentary assemblages: (1) isolated burials, and (2) artifacts, traces of houses, and mortuary remains from
settled villages. The isolated burials are associated with equestrian nomads, and
may relate to any one of several groups, including the Plains Apache, Kiowa,
Comanche, southern Cheyenne, and southern Arapaho. The ancestral affiliation
of the materials from prehistoric settled villages in the Texas Panhandle is
unknown, but those in the South Plains, north central regions of Texas, and
western Oklahoma, may relate to certain Plains Caddoan groups (Baugh 1991).
Historically, Plains Caddoan sites in Texas are identified as occupied by Wichitaspeaking groups, and they have been grouped under the heading of the Nortefio
focus (Duffield and Jelks 1961:71-72).

The Wichita adopted the horse by 1700 and played important roles in the
acquisition and trade of horses to other Indian groups, Anglo-Americans, and
Spanish, but they did not become nomadic wanderers. Instead, they maintained
their agricultural fields and gardens up to the time they were removed to Indian
Territory (Newcomb and Field 1967).
There has been no such archeological designation for the more nomadic
groups that ranged into the Southern High Plains in the nineteenth century.
These equestrian hunting/raiding nomadic groups in the Texas Panhandle and
Southern High Plains, were mainly Comanche, Kiowa, Kiowa Apache, southern Cheyenne, and southern Arapaho, all of whom quickly adopted the horse
by about 1700. These equestrian groups became so efficiently mobile that little
material residue was left behind at their encampments to mark them for the
archeological record. The tipi poles, covers, bedding, containers, and other everyday essentials were carried from camp to camp with the aid of horses. Not
surprisingly, only two of these settlements have been identified archeologically,
the Sand Pit and Sandstone Ledger sites, both in the Mackenzie Reservoir basin
(Willey et al. 1978; Willey and Hughes 1978). The archeological presence of
these equestrian nomads is, however, more frequently noted by an occasional
human burial accompanied by personal adornments, horse trappings, and other
belongings. The burial associations constitute a purely Indian expression even
though the materials were acquired through trading among, or raiding against,
Mexican, French, or Anglo-Americans.
The archeological identity of this historic Native American material complex comes almost exclusively from mortuary data. A limited number of Late
Historic Plains Indian burials have been documented in the Southern Plains of
Texas and western Oklahoma. Reported burials/sites in Texas include:
Yellowhouse Canyon (Newcomb 1955), White (Suhm 1962), W. H. Watson
(Ray and Jelks 1964), Cogdell (Word and Fox 1975), Morgan Jones (Parsons
1967), Merrell (or Long Hollow Burial) (A. J. Taylor, personal communication
1988), several finds near Ozona (Hester 1968), and the Canyon Creek burial
reported herein. In Oklahoma, reported historic Plains Indian burials include the
Rabbit Hill (Pearson 1978), Poafpybitty (McWilliams and Jones 1976), and
Jared (Jackson 1972) sites. The location of these finds are shown in Figure 1.
Unpublished records are available on about 10 additional burials in Texas mentioned in Word and Fox (1975); efforts are being made to thoroughly document
some of these burial sites (A. J. Taylor, personal communication 1988).

PREVIOUS APPROACHES TO STUDYING
HISTORIC PLAINS INDIAN BURIALS
Previous studies of Historic Plains Indian burials have tended to be site
specific, with two rather limited goals beyond a basic description of the findings.

The first was to assess the date of the burial based on associated artifacts, and
the second was to determine tribal affiliation.
Dating historic burials on the basis of associated artifacts is a standard
archeological procedure utilizing associated European trade goods, buttons,
weapons, hoes, knives, or other objects. All of the historic burials cited above
date to the nineteenth century. We have employed the same method to date the
Canyon Creek burial.
Determining tribal identity is a more difficult task. The double burial at the
Poafpybitty site was identified as Kiowa based on a local Comanche informant
and comparative studies; the Jared burial was identified as Comanche on the
basis of literary and historic records (Jackson 1972), although it could be Kiowa.
The Rabbit Hill burial was identified by Pearson (1978) as Kiowa Apache using
archeological and photographic evidence. Yellowhouse Canyon, Cogdell, Morgan Jones, and White were probably Comanche, but there is no way of being
certain of any of the Texas cases.

CANYON CREEK BURIAL (41OC13)
The Canyon Creek burial was discovered by Matthew Sell and a friend,
Craig Gingerich, in the winter of 1987 while exploring the cave for evidence of
prehistoric artifacts. Shafer, Ellzey, and Owsley visited the site in the summer
of 1988 at the request of the landowner, and planned for future investigations.
The site consists of two small horizontal fissure caves (Figure 2A) formed
in the dolomite caprock. The burial was in the larger cave (Figure 2B). These
small caves are vigorously defended during the warmer seasons by a rather large
population of black widow spiders and rattlesnakes. Primarily for that reason,
the burial was not excavated until November 1988 (during a blizzard) by Shafer,
Ellzey, Owsley, Brian S. Shaffer, and David Tucker.
The floor of the burial cave contained a shallow fill with exposed bedrock
along the west wal!; a natural crevice in the floor on the’east side was filled with
fine wind-blown sediment. The burial was placed in the deepest deposit of fill in
the cave. The floor sloped downward about 1 m toward the entrance from the
place of the burial.

Excavation

Prior to excavation, Ellzey and David Tucker mapped the cave (Figure 3),
and the burial area. Excavation focused on the burial itself, which was exposed,
photographed, drawn, and removed for analysis. All fill was screened through a
1/16-inch mesh; approximately 11 kg of soil was collected and water or dry
screened through 1/16-inch mesh at Texas A&M University to recover glass
beads and microfaunal remains.

Copies of maps, drawings, notes, and photographs are on file at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin. The
material culture items were returned to the landowner.

The Burial
The burial was that of a child approximately five years old. The body and
associated items were covered with a mounded layer of dolomite cobbles (see
Figure 2B). There is some evidence to suggest that the entrance of the cave was
walled up, as a linear mound of dolomite cobbles lay across the entrance at the
time the site was first visited by the authors in the summer of 1988 (see Figure 3)
A packrat nest had been constructed among the dolomite rocks covering the
burial. This nest was extensively used as evidenced by packed fecal and other
organic material among the rocks. Termites had badly damaged most of the
wooden articles, and the percolating moisture undoubtedly contributed to severe
deterioration of all organic material.
The body was placed in a shallow pit dug into the eolian fill along the south
wall of the cave (see Figure 3), approximately 6 m from the entrance. The body
was placed in a semi-flexed position on its left side with the head to the east and
facing south (Figures 4, 5).
Numerous artifacts were placed with the body (see Figure 4), including a
"killed" adult saddle frame, a complete child’s saddle frame, a bridle (represented by the bits and fragments of leather straps), a wooden stirrup frame, a
wooden ladle, a silver ring, and two copper rings. Items of adornment include 23
copper bracelets, of which 10 were on the right forearm, 12 were on the left, and
another was against the right side of the skull near the occip!tal; the latter was
probably wom as a hair ornament similar to that found with the Cogdell burial
(Word and Fox 1975). A small red leather beaded pouch or bag (probably a
tobacco pouch) was found in the chest area; the item’s position suggests that it
was suspended around the neck.
Textile impressions on one of the bracelets of the right arm, the pattern of
bead distribution, and a concentration of fibrous organic material beneath the
burial all suggest that the corpse was dressed in cloth. No remnants of the cloth
remained, however, but three brass buttons were recovered.
A single string of white glass beads was found scattered about the head;
presumably these were once threaded into the hair. White beads and blue beads
were found along the south side of the burial pit, primarily between the left
hand and the knees. These beads may have embellished a type of garment.
The only other concentration of beads was around the beaded leather pouch
noted above.
An iron bridle bit was placed over the chest area. Fragments of leather
straps, presumably from the bridle reins, were also found near the bit and in front
of the face.

An adult saddle frame was broken and scattered about the area over the legs.
The breakage appeared to be deliberate as the pommel and cantle were both
snapped at the fork.
A child-size saddle frame was placed intact along the north side of the grave
against the skull. Inside the side boards of this saddle frame was a wooden ladle
placed upside down. On the west side of the saddle was the wooden frame of a
stirrup. Against the top of the stirrup was a copper ring.

site was provided by Owsley at the Department of Anthropology, Smithsonian
Institution, Washington, D. C.

(left side) were consistent with an age of 4.5-5.5 years (Ubelaker 1978) and were
as follows: humerus (166 ram), radius (129 ram), ulna (143 ram), femur (233

The mild wear on the deciduous teeth and the general craniofacial morphology (i.e., form of the zygomaxillary suture, shape of the nasal aperture, prominence and angle of the nasal bones, absence of a nasal sill, shape of eyes, and
straightness of the palatine suture) are characteristic of Native Americans of the
Plains. In addition, radiographs of the unerupted permanent maxillary incisors
reveal the shovel shape that is a typical trait of Native Americans.

294

that enable sex determination of adults have an intermediate expression in this
child, and thus have little diagnostic value. The mental eminence of the mandible, however, is squared and blunt, the gonial angle is acute (116 degrees),
and the ascending ramus is relatively wide. These traits are characteristic of
males.
The cranium is virtually complete, lacking only part of the right zygomatic
process. Traces of rodent incisor marks are apparent on the orbits, zygomae,
and right mandibular condyle. Such gnawing caused the missing and crumbling
portions of the right zygoma and zygomatic process. The vault displays
asymmetrical areas of thinning of the parietals, temporals, and occipitals (i.e.,
arachnoid granulations/pachyonian depressions). There is no evidence of cribra
orbitalia or ectocranial porosis, and hence no indication of malnutrition, iron
deficiency anemia, hookworm infestation, malaria, and other such causes of
these conditions.
The maxillary deciduous canines and incisors are missing (postmortem
loss), but the permanent teeth are visible in the gubernacular canals. Maxillary teeth present and erupted include the left and right deciduous first and
second molars; the left permanent molars are present but unerupted. Mandibular
deciduous teeth present and erupted include three incisors, both canines, and
first and second molars (an unerupted permanent tooth is visible below the
missing left first incisor). The left permanent first and second molars and the
right second molar are present and unerupted; the right first molar is partially
erupted. The deciduous teeth display minimal occlusal surface abrasions and
only mild deposits of calculus. There is no evidence of caries or alveolar
abscessing. The left mandibular first deciduous molar displays three roots, a
rare occurrence.
Missing postcranial elements include the scapulae, clavicles, sternum, coccyx, patellae, right humerus, and a few ribs and vertebrae. Examination of the
bones revealed no indication of congenital or developmental abnormality, nor
of lesions resulting from disease or trauma. However, X-rays of the tibiae and
femora show the presence of several faint transverse lines of arrested growth
(Harris lines) (Garn et al. 1968). One corresponding set, which formed during
infancy, is evident in the proximal and distal tibiae and the distal femora. These
lines reflect an episode of disturbed long bone growth, followed by recovery,
and probably were caused by an illness or a period of severe malnutrition. Green
stains are apparent on the radii and ulnae, being more vivid on the left than
the right (archeological data on the burial indicate that the bracelets on the
arms are the cause of the stains on the arm bones).
In conclusion, examination of this burial indicates that the skeleton is that
of a subadult, possibly a male, about five years of age. The child was in good
health at the time of death, and the skeleton reveals nothing about the possible cause of death, as no lesions or abnormalities are present.

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS

The artifacts recovered from 41OC13 are described, and examples illustrated, in this section of the article. Limited documentary research was conducted
to provide a broader context of analysis and preliminary interpretations and
inferences.

Horse Gear
Horse gear includes two Indian-made saddles, a wooden stirrup frame, an
iron bridle bit, and fragments of a leather bridle or headstall.

Iron Bridle Bit

This specimen is a Spanish spade type bit that exhibits curation and repair
(Figure 6). The bit is made of iron and is heavily rusted and pitted, but has been
conserved by Dr. D. L. Hamilton and Georgia Fox at Texas A&M University.
The roller on the spade is missing, but the crosspiece for the roller is still present.
The curb chain is also missing but one hook for this chain is present. A piece of
iron wire has been added to the spade part of the bit and connects and fastens
both cheekpieces to the spade. This may indicate repair of an otherwise nonfunctional bit. The cheekpieces have a series of perforations that form two
convex rows. The upper row is comprised of 11 holes and the inner row of four
holes. The spade is scalloped along the edge and convex in cross section. The bit
measures 32.6 cm between the cheekpieces.

Leather Bridle or Headstall Fragments (Figure 7; N=12)
There are five fragments of leather headstall or bridle fragments that are
2.5 cm in width. The remaining seven specimens are small non-diagnostic fragments. Two of the longer fragments have a series of small diagonal notches on
one side. Presumably, this was to facilitate fastening the end of the strap into a
buckle that is no longer present. There are four other specimens that have a series
of stitching holes around their edges. Rivet or brad holes are present on two
specimens. No buckles or rivets remain on any of the strap fragments.

Pommel (Figure 9A)
The pommel was manufactured from the fork of a small tree or branch that
resembles cottonwood. Remnants of bark still remain on the underside of the V.
The top of the pommel is notched.

At the ends of the forks on each side of the pommel are pairs of notches
for lashing the pommel to the side boards of the saddle. One fork is incomplete and has only one set of notches. The complete fork had two notches.
The first set is 12 cm from the top of the pommel, and the lower set of notches
is 3.5 cm below the upper set. The upper pair of notches on the broken fork
is 12.5 cm from the top of the pommel. Overall dimensions for the pommel
are: height 12.5 cm, and 15 cm distance between the forks of the pommel.

Cantle (Figure 9B)
The cantle is manufactured of the same wood type as the pommel. The
top of the cantle is carved flat and is spatulate in shape. As with the pommel,
the cantle was also carved from the fork of a small tree or limb; bark is also
present. The back surface of the cantle top is convex while the interior is
slightly concave.
One fork is incomplete due to decay, while the other fork is complete.
There are two pair of notches on the complete fork. The upper pair of notches
is 13.5 cm from the top of the cantle. The lower pair of notches is 4 cm below
the upper pair.
Binding impressions are present across the broad outer surface of the complete fork, between the notches. Microscopic examination revealed traces of
decayed leather over part of the cantle.

Complete Side Board (Figure IOA)
This sideboard was constructed of cottonwood. This piece is concave/
convex along the long axis, being probably hand-contoured. A series of binding holes were prepared at each end of the side board. The same hole pattern
was used on both ends.
Microscopic analysis of the holes indicated they were made by burning
(cf. Ewers 1980:Figure 52a). It is possible that the holes were first burned into
the wood with a red-hot metal rod or awl and then reamed out to their present
diameter. The holes were not produced biconically. Hole diameter ranges from
0.5-0.6 cm. A small bit of decayed leather is still present on one end of the
side board, evidence that the saddle frame was once wrapped in rawhide. Linear
binding impressions are still visible in this region. Rodent gnawing and decay
have damaged much of this piece.
Dimensions for this side board are: Length, 30.7 cm; width of ends, 8.7
cm; width of middle, 7.8 cm; thickness: ends, 0.8 and 0.79 cm; middle, 0.63
cm.

Stirrup (Figure IOC)

The stirrup was manufactured of four separate pieces, all of cottonwood.
There is one rectangular portion (stirrup tread), two sides of a bentwood construction, and a narrow strip (2 cm wide) across the top bridging both side pieces.
The bottom portion is hand-shaped and measures 9.0 cm front to back and 8.7 cm
side to side. It is 0.7 cm in thickness. Each side of this piece is beveled to
accommodate the stirrup arch construction.
The sides of the stirrup were also cut and shaped by hand. The upper portion
that forms the arch is bent and tapered to shape. The dimensions of the side parts
of the stirrup are: Side part A: length, 8.1 cm; width, 8.0 cm; thickness, 0.6 cm;
Side part B: length, 8.7 cm; width, 7.4 cm; thickness, 0.5 cm.

Adult Saddle
Structurally, the adult saddle is virtually identical to the child’s saddle, only
larger in scale. No components of the adult saddle are illustrated, but measurements and verbal descriptions are presented below.

Pommel
The pommel was probably manufactured from the fork of a small cottonwood tree. This specimen is in two pieces, and is incomplete, but there are traces
of the original leather or hide cover in crevasses of the wood.
A series of two notches is present on the complete fork. The first pair is 22.3
cm from the top, and the second pair of notches is 4 cm below the first pair. The
lower pair is actually a single large groove partially encircling the distal area of
the fork. No binding impressions were present.
The length of the pommel is estimated to have been about 27.5 cm. Estimated width between the forks of the complete pomme! is 25.5 cm.

Cant/e
The cantle of the adult saddle was constructed of mesquite. It also was
carved similarly to the cantle of the child’s saddle described above. Both forks of
the cantle are complete. Apair of grooves, carved with a metal tool, is present at
the distal end of each fork. The upper groove is 22.5 cm from the top of the
cantle. The second groove is 4 cm below the first groove. Much of the bark still
remains on the surface of the cantle. The length of the cantle is 25.5 cm. Width
between the forks is 24.5 cm.

Complete Side Board
This side board (probably of cottonwood) is mostly complete, but is severely warped and damaged by cracking and rodent gnawing. Traces of decayed
leather covering still remain on the side board.
A set of seven binding holes are present on each end of this piece. Hole
diameter ranges from 0.4-0.7 cm. Holes were created by burning with a red-hot
metal rod or awl, and then by reaming the hole to its present shape. The hole
pattern follows very closely that for the child’s saddle. The estimated length of
this specimen is about 44 cm.

DISCUSSION OF HORSE GEAR
The spade bit is not common in eighteenth and nineteenth century
archeological collections from the Southern Plains (Jay C. Blaine, personal
communication, 1993). According to Blaine, the spade bit is more common in
Spanish colonial areas of Sonora and southern Arizona. The Canyon Creek
specimen may have been acquired through trading with, or raiding among,
Spanish/Mexican settlements in New Mexico or northern Mexico. Trading
expeditions between the Southern Plains Indians and the New Mexico settlements
and Comancheros are well documented (Berlandier 1969:120; Haley 1935;
Kenner 1969; Levine 1991), but so was raiding in northern Mexico (Campbell
and Field 1968:129). Kenner (1969:85) specifically mentions saddlery as one of
the items of Comanchero trade.
Both of the Canyon Creek saddles are unquestionably of Indian origin.
The style is comparable to that which the Blackfoot called "prairie chicken
snare saddle" (Ewers 1980:81). According to Grinnell (1923, I:207, cited in
Ewers 1980:92), this type of saddle was an invention of the Kiowa and was
in common use in the middle decades of the nineteenth century.
According to Ewers (1980), there were basically three types of Indian
saddles. The oldest form was the "pad saddle" made by stuffing soft skin pillows with animal hair. The pad saddle was mostly used by men. The second
type of saddle was the woman’s saddle, which consisted of forked pieces laced
to two side boards. The pommel and cantle were each curved outward at the
top, and were characteristically high relative to the third type of saddle, the
prairie chicken snare saddle. The difference between the woman’s saddle and
the prairie chicken snare saddle is that the pommel and cantle are low rather
than high on the latter. The sideboards and girting were much the same. The
two saddle types are related, and Ewers (1980) believes the style was derived
from Spanish pack saddles.
William Soule, a frontier photographer, photographed a saddle of the prairie
chicken snare type on a southern Cheyenne horse sometime between 1868-1874
(Belous and Weinstein 1969:75). Another example taken from a Comanche raid

Shafer et al. ~ The Canyon Creek Site

303

on Corpus Christi is illustrated by Berlandier (1969:Figure 18). This raid must
have taken place between 1827 and 1835 when Berlandier was in Texas, and
suggests that the prairie chicken snare saddle dates as early as the first quarter of
the nineteenth century.
Ewers (1980:80-81) states that saddle making was done by women. In
making the Cheyenne prairie chicken snare saddle,
a woman softened two sections of antler from flesh killed elk or
blacktail deer in warm water to rend them pliable. The sections were
then bent and cut to the desired shape, one for the pommel and the
other for the cantle. Some women burned holes near each end of the
section of antler for tying it to the wooden side boards; others made
two horizontal grooves and passed the tie strong through these grooves
and holes burned in the sideboards. The saddle was then covered with
green rawhide and protected from warping while the rawhide was
drying by the same methods used in making all-wood saddles.
While antler was used among the northern Cheyenne and other Northern
Plains groups, wood was substituted in the Central and Southern Plains. The
senior author, however, has observed a saddle of this type with antler used
for the pommel and cantle in the Clarendon Museum in Clarendon, Texas. Also,
an elk horn pommel and cantle attributed to mid-nineteenth century Comanche
are in the Museum of the Great Plains collections in Lawton, Oklahoma (artifact numbers 61.119.4a and 4b; Joe S. Hays, personal communication, 1994).
The Canyon Creek Cave saddles were identical in construction to the
Cheyenne saddle except that wood was used rather than antler. The types of
woods (mesquite and cottonwood) would also place their manufacture in the
Southern Plains. The prairie chicken snare saddles were all-purpose saddles
used for riding and as pack saddles. The prairie chicken snare saddles also
help to date this burial to the mid-nineteenth century (1825-1875). Excellent
examples of women’s saddles and a prairie chicken snare saddle are in the
Panhandle Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, Texas.
Word and Fox (1975) list horse gear, second to glass beads, as the most
common items found with historic Southern Plains Indian burials. Saddles, bits,
bridles, and bridle trappings have been found singularly or together.
The inclusion of saddles as grave items was a known practice of the
Comanche (Jackson 1972; Yarrow 1881); however, the trait was also well
known among other Southern Plains groups, and thus does not provide a reliable means of identifying the tribal affiliation of any particular burial.
Adult-size prairie chicken snare saddles were found with adult males at
the Merrell and Owens sites in Floyd County, Texas (Anna J. Taylor, personal
communication, 1988; Tunnell 1984). These saddles constitute the only other
examples of the prairie chicken snare saddle currently known from the archeological record.

304

Texas Archeological Society

Saddles of either Mexican or western American style with prominent
rounded horns have been recovered from several nineteenth century Southern
Plains burials. The nomenclature for these kinds of saddles varies according
to the source. A "Santa Fe" style Spanish saddle was associated with the adult
male burial from the Cogdell site in Floyd County (Word and Fox 1975). A
saddle, identified by Word and Fox as a probable "Santa Fe" style saddle, was
found with the White site burial in Yoakum County (Suhm 1962); another
possible "Santa Fe" or western style saddle was found with the Jared site burial
(Jackson 1972).

Utensil
Wooden Ladle or Drinking Vessel (Figure 11)
This artifact is of cottonwood or a similar species. The general shape of the
ladle is oval and the handle is broken. The bottom of the cup is badly decayed
from packrat urine. A hole was drilled into the handle at its juncture with the
body. This hole is 0.7 cm in diameter. A small portion of the end of the handle is
still present and the estimated handle length is 3.5 cm. Dimensions: Length, 22.5
cm; width, 12.6 cm; depth, 6 cm; thickness is highly variable.
Wooden utensils were not uncommon among the various Plains horse nomads. Markoe et al. (1986:115, 164) illustrate two examples of wooden containers identified as Sioux and Yanktonai Dakota, respectively.

Beaded Leather Pouch
A small beaded leather pouch was recovered from the upper chest area. The
object appeared as a mass of beads covering and partially adhering to, two or
more layers of very decomposed leather. Because of its deteriorated condition, it
was not possible to determine if the leather was native-tanned. The interior side
of the leather was dyed red.
The majority of the beads in the collection, except for the blue and white
beads found along the left side of the body and the white beads around the head,
came from this pouch. The specific bead pattern was not discernible, although a
partial pattern was preserved that consisted of a block of red beads against a
block of white beads. Partial patterns also can be seen in the X-ray photograph
(Figure 12). The outer surface decoration included eight hair pipe beads and
larger glass beads. The pouch was fringed with strings of beads; small iron
tinklers tipped the ends of each fringe.
A small mass of a brown organic substance was between the layers of
leather, presumably the contents of the pouch. Microscopically, this substance
has the powdered consistency of snuff with small (ca. 1 mm) pieces of leafy

structure. Samples of this material were collected for positive identification,
although superficially the substance appears to be tobacco.

Discussion
An undecorated leather pouch, similar to that from Canyon Creek, was
found at the White site that contained vermillion (Suhm 1962). Beaded pouches
were common accoutrements carried by the nineteenth century Plains Indians,
and were used to carry tobacco, medicines, strike-a-lights, and paint. Numerous
examples of "tobacco," "medicine," or strike-a-light pouches are present in the
ethnographic collections at the Panhandle Plains Historical Museum at Canyon,
Texas. Figure 13 illustrates two of these ethnographic specimens from the Panhandle Plains Historical Museum collected in the late nineteenth century; one
(see Figure 13A) was identified as Plains Apache. We cannot be certain that the
Figure 13 examples are in fact pre-reservation specimens. In the latter part of the
nineteenth century, Fort Sill Apaches (including Chiricahua) made such bags for
Anglo-American traders (Joe S. Hays, personal communication, 1994). Hays
feels that many of the bags labeled as "ethnographic specimens" in various
museums today were produced by the Fort Sill Apaches. The bags from the
Panhandle Plains Historical Museum are illustrated here simply to give the
reader a general idea of the likely appearance of the Canyon Creek specimen.
A similar pouch (probably Dakota) is illustrated by Markoe et al. (1986:152).
Will Soule photographed Comanche adorned with similar pouches (Belous and
Weinstein 1969:105, 109).

Shell and Glass Beads
Tubular Shell Beads (N=8; Figure 14A)
Although the specimens have suffered from slight weathering, some retain traces of a high polish. Three of the eight specimens appear to be full
length hair pipes, while five appear to be either reworked fragments or shorter
examples.
Length of the full-sized specimens ranges from 4.6-5.5 cm. Outside diameters range from 0.69-0.8 cm. Inside diameter averages 0.2 cm. The length of
the five short specimens ranges from 1.1-1.6 cm. Outside diameter ranges from
0.7-0.78 cm. Inside diameter also averages 0.2 cm. A remnant of a red string
was found inside one of the larger hair pipes.
These specimens compare in both dimensions and appearance to similar
artifacts from the White site (Suhm 1962:92-93). A breast plate made of hair

and Fox 1975).
These shell beads or "hair pipes" were probably manufactured from the lip
of Strombus gigas (cf. Ewers 1957:42). According to Ewers (1957:42), the
manufacture of these artifacts began between 1776 and 1798. Manufacture was

dominated by the family and descendants of William Campbell of Pascack (Park
Ridge), Bergen County, New Jersey. Ewers (1957:74) states that the distribution
of these artifacts to Plains Indians by U.S. Government agencies occurred prior
to 1850. Shell hair pipes are also listed among the items traded to the Indians
by the U. S. sponsored Indian trading factories (Peake 1954:45-81). The
widespread use of these ornaments in breastplates followed their mechanized
production in 1850.

Glass Beads (N=2500+)
The identification and classification of the glass beads associated with the
burial follows that developed by Kidd and Kidd (1970). Although previous studies of beads from Historic Native American sites in Texas have used the bead
classification developed by R. K. Harris and others, and systemized by Harris
and Harris (1967) (for example, Suhm 1962; Word and Fox 1975; Harris et al.
1993), we chose to use Kidd and Kidd (1970) since it is a more recent study
and provides more specific information on nineteenth century bead types. This
classification system is based upon manufacture methods and physical attributes
of the beads.
Prior to classification, all beads were separated according to manufacture.
Two basic methods of manufacture were noted among the beads: tubular or
drawn and wire wound (cf. Kidd and Kidd 1970; Harris and Harris 1967:134138). Tubular beads are mass-produced whereas wire wound beads are individually hand-crafted.
The analyzed bead sample consists of those specimens found within the
loose fill of the burial and during water screening of the burial fill (Table 1).
An unknown number not included in this sample remain attached to a small
beaded pouch (see Figure 12).

Tubular or Drawn Beads
Ifl (N=7) (Figure 14G)
There are six blue beads and one black bead of this type. These are
monochrome tubular beads whose surfaces have been faceted by grinding. The
ends were broken irregularly and smoothed slightly. The blue beads were
manufactured from clear glass while the black specimen is of an opaque glass.
The beads are hexagonal in shape and range in size from 5.8-8 mm in diameter.
The diameter of the hole ranges from about 1-3 mm.

These are black beads; an opaque glass was used in the manufacture of
these specimens. Bead diameter ranges from 4.4-4.9 mm, and hole diameters are
about 1 mm.

hole diameter is approximately 1 mm. The larger size group is represented by
15 specimens. Bead diameter for this group ranges from 5-5.5 mm and hole
diameter ranges from 1-2 mm.

IIa41 (N=123) (Figure 14F)
This is a robin’s egg blue circular bead type manufactured from an opaque
glass. Bead diameter ranges from 3-3.7 mm and the hole diameter is 1 mm.

Iia59 (N=364) (Figure 14C, D)
Rose wine red is the color of this circular bead type; a clear glass was used
in bead manufacture. Size variation is greatest among this group of circular beads
than for any other bead group, as bead diameter ranges from 2-4 mm, and hole
diameters are about 1 mm.

IIIf2 (N=17) (Figure 14K)
This type is a bichrome tubular bead that has had the surface facetted by
grinding. The general appearance of this type is the same as that for type Ifl,
the only difference being the use of two glass colors. The body of this type
has a light blue or ultramarine color and was manufactured of clear glass. The
core is a light aqua blue of translucent glass. The beads are hexagonal in shape
and diameters range from 6-9 mm, with hole diameters from 1.5-2 mm.

IVa9 (N=101) (Figure 14E)
This is a bichrome circular bead type with a scarlet red exterior of clear
glass and a white core of opaque glass. Bead diameters are 3 mm and hole
diameters are about 1 mm.

IVal3 (N=44) (Figure 14B)
This is also a bichrome circular bead type with a white exterior of white
translucent glass and a gray core of clear glass. Bead diameters range from 2-3
mm, and hole diameters range from less than 1 mm to 1 mm.

Wire- Wound Beads
Wlb (N=I) (Figure 14J)
This is a clear, dark red, glass bead. The ends of this bead are slightly

Texas Archeological Society

Bead diameter is 7.5 mm, and it has a hole diameter of 1.5 mm.

WIb2 (N=27) (Figure 14L)
This monochrome round bead type is represented by two basic size categories. The smallest group (N=13) is manufactured from an opaque white glass.
Bead diameters range from 6-7 mm, and hole diameters range from 1.5-2 mm.
The larger group (N=14) is also manufactured from a white colored glass. In two
specimens, a translucent white glass was used; in all others a white opaque glass
was used in manufacture. Bead diameter ranges are from 8-9 mm, with hole
diameters of 2 mm. The ends of most of the beads are collared from the manufacture process but most of them have been reduced by grinding.

WIcl (N=10) (Figure 14M)

This is a monochrome oval bead type manufactured from an opaque white
glass. Bead diameter ranges are from 6-7 mm, and hole diameters range from
1.5-2 mm. The ends of these beads have been ground smooth and no collars are
evident.

WIcll (N=I) (Figure 140)

This is a clear, ultramarine blue bead. It has a bead diameter of 7.4 mm, and
a hole diameter of 1.5 mm. This specimen is broken and incomplete on one end.
The opposite end is slightly collared but has been ground smooth.

WId (N=2) (Figure 14P)

This is a monochrome donut-shaped bead type. One specimen is manufactured from an opaque robin’s egg blue glass. Bead diameter is 12 mm and hole
diameter is 2 mm. The ends of this bead have been ground very smooth. The
second specimen is manufactured from a clear, ultramarine blue glass. The ends
of this bead are not as highly ground as the larger specimen. Bead diameter is 8.5
mm and hole diameter is 2 mm.

Miscellaneous Unidentified Beads (N=2) (Figure 14Q)
These specimens are round beads manufactured from a clear green glass.
Both specimens are highly flawed by numerous internal fractures as if they had
been subjected to decrepitation from heat or weathering. None of the other bead
types exhibit this feature. These beads are very well shaped but could not be
identified as being either the drawn or wire wound variety. Bead diameter ranges

Shafer et al. -- The Canyon Creek Site

are from 7.5-8.6 ram, and hole diameters are 2 ram. One of the two beads is
slightly collared at the ends.

Discussion
Glass trade beads are the most frequent item found in Historic Native
American sites. The use of glass beads among Native Americans was predominately to embellish clothing, and items carried such as small pouches, parfleches,
quivers, and body ornamentation. The manufacture and distribution of glass
trade beads is well documented. Orchard (1929), Ewers (!957), Woodward
(1965), and Schieber (1994) provide references to the study of glass beads in
the Plains, while Duffield and Jelks (1961), Harris and Harris (1967), Word and
Fox (1975), and Harris et al. (1993) are relevant glass bead studies from Texas
sites.
In a recent analysis of the glass bead assemblage from the Pitchfork
Rockshelter site (48PA42) in northwestern Wyoming, Schieber (1994) provides
convincing evidence of the utility of beads as chronological indicators in historic
Plains Indian burial sites. Pitchfork Rockshelter is a probable early nineteenth
century Crow Indian double burial. The bead assemblage consisted of over 1,000
small tubular or drawn pony beads. There were also 21 monochrome necklace
beads (Schieber 1994:37-38). Detailed measurements and statistical analysis of
all complete beads (n=1034) has provided useful data that can be effectively
drawn on to assess other Plains Indian burials with substantial bead assemblages.
The Canyon Creek burial, with its large bead assemblage, provides an excellent
comparative data set. Even though the level of detail in analysis differs between
Canyon Creek and Pitchfork Rockshelter, it is felt that significant statements can
be developed regarding the temporal span of the Canyon Creek bead assemblage
from Schieber’s (1994) information.
Schieber (1994:38) briefly discusses the "pony bead period" from about
1800 to 1840-1850 as a time when there was a distinct preference among native
groups on the Northern Plains for larger embroidery or pony beads for design
work. These beads are characterized by outside diameters of 3.0-5.0 mm. In the
middle of the nineteenth century, there was a shift in preference for the smaller
seed beads with outside diameters of 2.0 mm or less.
The more significant characteristics of the bead assemblage from Pitchfork
Rockshelter include: a limited color range; larger bead sizes (interior and exterior
diameters); and the presence of large monochrome necklace beads without polychrome bodies. The latter have been observed in Plains Indian burials dating
after 1840-1850 (Schieber 1994:40). There was also a greater recorded variability in the dimensions of the various bead types.
The bead data from Canyon Creek can be compared to these temporal
indicators to establish a general bead chronology for the site. Table 1 presents the
bead data from Canyon Creek for comparison with Pitchfork Rockshelter and
other Historic Indian assemblages.

Texas Archeological Society

Schieber (1994) reported that color variation among the small embroidery
or pony beads at Pitchfork Rockshelter was limited to four main bead colors:
white (67 percent), turquoise (21 percent), red with white centers (8 percent), and
black (4 percent). The total number of pony beads in the analyzed sample at
Canyon Creek is 2445 (97.8 percent of the tota! bead sample). Colors represented
among the pony beads from the site include white (73.2 percent), red (14.9
percent), blue (5 percent), red with white centers (4.1 percent), and black (0.2
percent). All of these are drawn beads.
The larger wire-wound beads (n=41) correspond to Schieber’s (1994:38-40)
description of large monochrome necklace beads. This category represents only
1.6 percent of the Canyon Creek bead sample, with white beads predominant.
Ultramarine blue and robin’s egg blue beads were apparently used for contrast.
Large monochrome necklace beads at Pitchfork Rockshelter represented about
2.1 percent of the assemblage.
Conclusions regarding the Canyon Creek beads are similar to those of
Pitchfork Rockshelter, and can be summarized by the following: (1) there is a
predominance of pony bead sizes with exterior diameters between 3.0-5.0 mm;
(2) color variation is limited; (3) there is a range of variability in the sizes of the
pony beads (see Table 1); and (4) large monochrome necklace beads are present
to the exclusion of necklace beads with polychrome bodies. Based on these
general similarities with Pitchfork Rockshelter, the Canyon Creek bead assemblage most probably represents the time period from 1800 to 1840-1850.

German Silver Finger Ring (N=I; Figure 15A)
This ring was manufactured from a single strap of German silver that is 5.6
mm in width and 0.9 mm in thickness. The ends of the ring do not meet, but taper
towards each other. The interior and exterior of the ring are heavily pitted.
Interior diameter is 12.3 mm. The ring was recovered in the proximity of the
beaded pouch.

Copper Rings (N=2)
Two small copper rings (adult finger-size) were found in proximity to the
child’s saddle and stirrup. Unfortunately, these specimens were lost during the
process of conservation, and were not available for description or precise measurement. Available information about the specimens indicates they were about 6
mm wide and bent into a circle about 14 mm in diameter.

Copper or Brass Jingle or Shoe Button (N=I; Figure 15B)
The specimen consists of two parts, a globose or spherical front and a diskshaped back portion. The shank attached to the back is a small oval loop 0.46 cm

Shafer et al. -- The Canyon Creek Site

in diameter, and is of a small gauge wire. No decoration is present on the dorsal
surface of the jingle. Dimensions: diameter, 0.98 cm; height, 0.72 cm.
This specimen compares favorably in size and appearance to similar artifacts from the White site (Suhm 1962:91 and Figure lj). Shoe buttons commonly
were used in the nineteenth century by Southern Plains Indians to adorn clothing,
added to the ends of fringes similar to the metal tinklers, tied to the ends of
thongs used to string hairpipe breastplates, or were used as components in
breastplates (Joe S. Hays, personal communication 1994).

Copper Bead (N=I; Figure 15C)
The copper bead was found near the right hand of the burial. The bead
consists of a small rolled rectangle of copper whose edges are not completely
flush, resulting in a 0.28 cm gap. Dimensions: length, 0.73 cm; diameter, 0.58
cm; thickness, 0.15 cm.

Cone-shaped Iron Tinklers (N=48)(Figure 15D)
There were 48 whole and fragmentary iron tinklers associated with the
small beaded pouch or bag. The condition of all specimens is very poor due to
rust. The approximate length of these tinklers is 2 cm. The edges of the tinklers
are flush and not overlapping. One specimen has a type WIb2 bead still articulated with the larger end, suggesting that these beads were strung below the iron
tinklers on the same strands. There are various types of beads still encrnsted onto
the surfaces of some of the tinklers but they display no particular pattern.

Discussion
Iron tinklers frequently tip the fringes of beaded items, especially small
beaded pouches or bags as can be seen in the specimens illustrated in Figure
13 from the Panhandle Plains Historical Museum. All of the eight pouches
examined by the senior author in the Ethnographic Collections at the Panhandle
Plains Historical Museum had tinklers tipping the fringe.

Small Brass or Copper Shank Buttons (N=3)
There were three small brass or copper dome-shaped buttons with stamped
designs on the exterior surface of the dome. Designs on two buttons are characterized by a series of four stamped floral designs (Figure 15E-F). These
designs are single flowers with stem and leaves that encircle the button. One
button has a stamped line encircling the dome (Figure 15G). Beyond this line,
at the edge of the button, are a series of connected diamonds encircling the

button. The button edge is rolled or crimped to create a shoulder. Al! designs
were machine or die stamped.
The buttons are about 10.4 mm in diameter and about 3 mm in height.
All shanks are of the same material as the buttons and are of a small gauge
wire. They were not attached to the buttons. The three buttons compare closely
with Olsen’s (1963) type I button. He dates these buttons from 1830 to the
present time.

Copper Wire Bracelets (N=23; Figures 16-17)
There were 23 pulled copper wire bracelets with the individual. Five of
these had designs filed or chisel-cut into the outer surface (Figure 16B). Rollout drawings of each decorated bracelet (identified by lot number) are shown
in Figure 17. One bracelet has a central zone of X’s bordered by a zone of
deep perpendicular notches (41OC13-18). At the ends of this bracelet a diagonal or zig-zag line has been cut into the surface. Another decorated bracelet has a design at one end characterized only by alternating zones of diagonal
cut lines and plain zones (41OC13-11). The design of the third bracelet is
composed of alternating zones of perpendicular cut lines and dihedral flat
hammered zones (41OC13-14); there are two zones of each. The fourth decorated bracelet has one zone of diagonal cut lines at one end (41OC13-10). The
final bracelet has a continuous series of perpendicular filed notches or lines
along the entire length (41OC13-9).
There are only three bracelets that do not exhibit evidence of cold hammering to flatten the round cross-section of the wire; none of these are decorated. The interior diameter of twenty-one complete bracelets ranges from 46.4
mm to 60 mm with an average of 56.5 mm. Wire diameters vary from 2.02 to
3.22 mm (Table 2).

Discussion
Word and Fox (1975) list copper bracelets behind horse gear as the third
most common item of inclusion in Historic Plains Indian burials in Texas. Copper bracelets were standard dress items among the females in the latter half
of the nineteenth century, as can be seen in Will Soule’s 1868-1874 photographs of the Wichita, Comanche, Kiowa, Kiowa Apache, Cheyenne, and other
Southern Plains groups (Belous and Weinstein 1969). The degree to which men
and children were ornamented with these items is difficult to tell, but six were
decorating the hair of the Cogdell site burial (Word and Fox 1975). If bracelets were used as hair ornaments only in males, then the single bracelet about
the head of the Canyon Creek child may provide further confirmation to
Owlsey’s skeletal observations that it was a male. However, the use of copper wire bracelets for the sexual identification of nineteenth century Southern

DATING THE CANYON CREEK SITE BURIAL
The time of burial was about 1830-1850 based on the associated artifacts.
First, the native-made prairie chicken snare saddle is a style that was in vogue
about the mid-nineteenth century according to Ewers (1980:92), and Berlandier
(1969) documents Comanche use of this saddle type shortly after 1825. Second, the brass buttons are of a style that dates after 1830 (Olsen 1963). Third,
the shell hair pipe beads are also consistent with an 1830s date. Finally, the

predominance of 3.0-5.0 mm diameter pony beads with a limited range of
colors, and the absence of seed beads less than 2.0 mm in diameter, dates the
burial from about 1800 to ca. 1840-1850. Given this information, and the fact
that horse nomads were all removed to reservations by 1875, the favored date
range for the Canyon Creek burial is from about 1830 to 1850.

TRIBAL IDENTITY
Despite the tribal diversity among the Indians of the Southern Plains in
the nineteenth century, the equestrian nomadism structured around buffa!o
hunting, raiding, and trading, resulted in the adoption of a common material
culture. Efforts to define tribal identity on the basis of associated artifacts, dates
for the burials, and locations have not been successful (Word and Fox 1975).
One simply cannot be sure on the basis of associated artifacts. Such items as
horse trappings (saddles, bits, and ornamentation), personal items (beads,
buttons, tinklers, pendants, breastplates, copper bracelets, copper and silver
rings, among others), implements (hoes, knives, and mirrors), weapons (guns,
lances, and bows) were all essentially the same since they were derived from
the same Spanish, French, and Anglo- American sources.

322

Texas Archeological Society
The inclusion of saddles as grave items was a known practice among the

Comanche (Yarrow 1881; Jackson 1972). However, the trait was also well
known among other Southern Plains groups, and thus saddle remains do not
provide a reliable means of identifying the tribal affiliation of any particular
burial.
Although specific groups ranged in loosely recognized geographic areas,
these could hardly be defined as territories in the anthropological sense. The
mobility made possible by the horses carried groups of raiders hundreds of miles
from their residential locale (Campbell and Field 1968). Treaties between the
Comanche and Wichita in the 1740s, and between the Comanche, Kiowa, and
Kiowa Apache in 1790, allowed for mixed parties and common sharing of
territorial ranges and resources after that time (Newcomb and Field 1967).
The location of the Canyon Creek site is in the general area of the Kiowa
and Kiowa-Apache hunting range in the early and mid-nineteenth century. According to Wallace and Hoebel (1952:7), this area was also the domain of the
Comanche. Newcomb (1961:Map 3), however, places the Kiowa and Kiowa
Apache in the northern Texas Panhandle in the nineteenth century. Based on the
general lack of success in assigning confident tribal identity to Historic Southern
Plains Indian burials, we feel that it is more fruitful to examine the collective
process of assimilation and change for these cultures using the burial complex as
a means of documenting this process. For that reason, we prefer using the term
equestrian nomads for the archeological remains of these various groups.

SOUTHERN PLAINS EQUESTRIAN NOMAD
ARCHEOLOGICAL COMPLEX
The geographic distribution of the Southern Plains Equestrian Nomad Archeological Complex is based on the known distribution of isolated nineteenth
century burials with equestrian accoutrements (see Figure 1). The range includes
the Southern High Plains and the adjacent prairies to the east.
In comparing the Canyon Creek material assemblage with those documented
from Historic Plains Indian burials (Word and Fox 1975), there is a notable
similarity in the associated material culture. A comparative list is shown in
Figure 18 (adapted after Word and Fox [1975] and Olive [1990]). Specific
groups had ways of expressing their identity through material expression (dress,
beadwork patterns, etc.), but whatever these stylistic ideosycracies were, they
rarely can be identified archeologically.
This Southern Plains Indian material assemblage is clearly structured
around equestrian technology and nomadism. It was on the basis of material
culture that Wissler (1934) and Kroeber (1963) defined the Plains culture area.
The material complex in these Southern Plains burials is distinctive enough
to warrant archeological recognition beyond the point of simply determining
the age of a burial, or attempting to determine its tribal affiliation. As noted

Shafer et al. ~ The Canyon Creek Site

323

previously, the equestrian nomad sites can also be distinguished from those
of the seasonally nomadic horticultural groups such as the Wichita. The archeological assemblages of the latter has already been defined as the Nortefio
Focus (Duffield and Jelks 1961).
The incorporation of the horse and all of its associated material assemblage
had an enormous effect on Plains Indian culture and value systems (Wissler
1914; Mishkin 1940). The horse transformed these cultures from hunter-gatherer
band or tribal farming groups to mobile pastoralists with direct means of acquiring wealth and status.
An adaptation to horse nomadism resulted in profound changes in subsistence practices and economic systems, and radically altered warfare, raiding, trading, marriage patterns, and even the kinship system of these Southern
Plains groups. Matrilineal agriculturally-oriented groups on the periphery of
the Plains became patrilineal or bilateral to accommodate the changes in the
economic system brought about by the introduction of the horse (Mishkin
1940:5-23).
Wealth among the Southern Plains Indians was measured by the numbers of
horses individuals possessed (Mishkin 1940:5-23). Berlandier (1969:44), for
example, stated that the poorest native owned six to eight horses, while the
richest had 30 to 40 or more. One Comanche, Big Fall by Tripping, owned
15,000 horses and 300-400 mules. A person’s acquired status was defined largely
on the number of horses owned; women could own horses also, but they did not
have the same freedom to acquire horses as did men.
Bride price was paid with horses (Wallace and Hoebel 1952:134); debts
were paid with horses (Wallace and Hoebel 1952:226). Horses became a medium
of exchange (Mishkin 1940:22; Wallace and Hoebel 1952:241), and killing
another’s favored horse was considered murder and treated as such (Wallace and
Hoebel 1952:233).
The similarity in material culture was also brought about by the frequent
mixing of the various tribal groups. For example, the Wichita and Comanche
formed an alliance about 1740; the Kiowa and Comanche became close allies
following the marriage of a Kiowa chief, E1 Roncon, to a Comanche woman
(Berlandier 1969:108); the southern Arapaho became closely affiliated with
the southern Cheyenne and Comanche in the early nineteenth century.

TRADE
Trade involving Southern Plains horse nomads has been discussed by Word
and Fox (1975:52-56). Their discussion centers mainly on the trading relationships of the Comanche, Spanish, and New Mexicans, including the Comancheros.
Perhaps the most active traders among the Native Americans of the prairie
woodlands and Plains in the later part of the eighteenth and the first three
quarters of the nineteenth century were Anglo-American traders.

Mutual trading between nomadic bison hunters and sedentary groups on
both sides of the High Plains, which extended well back into prehistoric times,
helped to set the stage for the evolution of the Southern Plains horse nomad
complex (Baugh 1991; Creel 1991). Mutualism, as defined by Spielmann
(1991:5), is "the exchange of material items or services to the benefit of all
participants in the interaction." Spielmann (1991) goes on to say that such relationships create interdependence among the participating groups with regard to
the goods and services each provides the other.
In the prehistoric Southern Plains, mutualism involved the trade of bison
hides and meat to the Southwestern pueblos in exchange for agricultural products and less important material items such as pottery, cotton cloth, obsidian,
and turquoise (Creel 1991); similar exchanges went eastward via the Plains
Caddoan people. The adaptation to the Southern Plains ecology by Apache
and Comanche groups was much the same with regards to resources used, and
in relationships with the Pueblo people. The differences in extent of trade may
have been defined by the degrees of mobility. Mutual trade between the pueblos
and Apache, Comanche, and Plains groups continued, and indeed may have
increased over that of the prehistoric groups. Apaches, and later Comanches,
became extensively involved in trade first with the pueblos, and then later with
the New Mexican Spanish/Mexican settlements (Levine 1991).
The material culture of these plains Indians was structured around the
horse and designed for mobility. Because the Indians had a beast of burden
larger than the dog, the amounts of material accumulations increased. So too
was their ability to amass items within their enlarged sphere of exchange. Trade
items provided by the Southern Plains Indians were animal hides (bison, deer,
and antelope), smoked and dried meat, tallow, horses, and slaves for the
Spanish. These commodities were highly sought by the Spanish, French, and
Anglo-American traders, and formal trading industries were established by each
to obtain these resources from the Native Americans (Peake 1954).
Hide traders had ventured out from the European settlements in Louisiana
since the early eighteenth century, and trading fairs were established at French
and Spanish settlements. Licensed American traders such as Philip Nolan and
Anthony Glass trespassed into Texas territory in the late eighteenth-early nineteenth century to trade among the Wichita and Comanches for horses and hides
(Flores 1985).
In exchange, the American traders supplied the Indians with: knives,
hardware--wire, files, copper pails, weapons, powder, ammunition, alcohol,
brown sugar, tobacco, hatchets, combs, corn, sword blades (for use as lance tips),
cloth, cinnabar, glass beads, trinkets, and mirrors. These French, Spanish, and
Anglo-American traders worked mostly among the Caddo and Wichita, but
Comanche, Kiowa, and other groups were included in these frontier trading fairs
and expeditions (Berlandier 1969:47-48; Flores 1985:30).
The U. S. Government established approximately 30 trading factories for
the Indians from 1795-1822 (Peake 1954:1-25). Factories in close proximity

Shafer et al. m The Canyon Creek Site

327

to the Southern Plains who furnished licensed traders included: Natchitoches,
Bayou Pierre, Sulphur Fork (all along the Red River), Arkansas Post, and
Spadra Bayou (a!ong the Arkansas), Marias de Cygne in western Missouri,
and Fort Osage, Arrow Rock, and Belle Fontane on the Missouri River (see
Figure 1). These trading factories furnished such items as: guns, whiskey, cloth,
thread, blankets, jewelry, silver, brass rings, wire, plumes and ostrich feathers, rouge, vermilion, looking-glasses, brass kettles and pots, knives, pieces
of copper and brass, tin pans, tin cups, jugs, crockery, glasses, mugs, forks,
spoons, candle molds, bullet molds, bellows, sugar, salt, flour, raisins, tea,
coffee, even spices which were used as otter and beaver bait, drugs, medicines, spectacles (green-glass spectacles mentioned), tobacco, pipes, tomahawk
pipes, wampum of clam and conch shell, broaches, hair pipes, and animal traps,
powder, powder horns, gunflints, shot, and blacksmith and carpenter tools.
Special order guns and canes were manufactured for gifts to ranking Indians
(Peake 1954:45-81).
In addition, a short-lived private trading post, the ruins of which were near
the famous Adobe Walls, was established on the Canadian River in the Texas
Panhandle by the Bent, St. Vrain and Company about 1840 (Baker and Harrison
1986:13-14). Its purpose was to trade with the Comanche, Kiowa, and Apaches,
but it was forced to close due to the hostilities of some of the roving bands. The
U. S. Government continued to supply the Comanche and Kiowa reservation
groups through Indian Agency commissaries established in Indian Territory after
1869 (Crouch 1978).

SUMMARY
The Canyon Creek burial dates to about 1830-1850, and is identified as
belonging to a Southern Plains equestrian nomad culture based on associated
artifacts. The child was identified as a Native American about five years old at
the time of death, and was probably a male. The skeletal analysis showed no
abnormal physical characteristics.
The archeological materials associated with equestrian nomad burials in the
Southern Plains constitute a distinctive archeological complex. The complex
includes an array of items obtained through European interaction that were
utilized as part of the horse pastoralism, and as tools, weapons, embellishments
of material items, as well as dress decorations. This material expression is a
uniquely Native American adaptation despite the dependence on European
sources for the raw materials and manufactured items. Thus far, the archeology
of this complex is derived exclusively from mortuary assemblages. Historic
Plains Indians burials have been recorded intermittently throughout the Southern
High Plains and in western Oklahoma.
Although the sources of material culture and uses of the horse are similar
to that of the prairie Caddoan groups such as the Wichita (and previously defined

328

Texas Archeological Society

archeologically as the Nortefio focus in Texas), there are differences in the
overall material expression resulting from different subsistence/settlement
patterns between the two groups. For example, pottery, tobacco pipes, agricultural products, storage pits, fixed housing, and formal cemeteries with
extended burials--generally oriented east-west with the head to the east (Schmitt
1952)-- are found in the Nortefio settlements (Bell and Bastian 1967; Duffield
and Jelks 1961; Story 1985). These features are either absent or obscure among
the highly mobile nomads. When one considers the larger scale economic system
that involved the nomadic and seasonally sedentary groups on one hand, and
the Europeans (Spanish, French, Mexican, and Anglo-Americans) on the other,
the differences between the horse nomads and the Plains village farmers become
less clear.
The economic foundation for the mutual trade between the Plains nomads
and European traders was established in Late Prehistoric times. The exchange
networks involved the pueblos in the Rio Grande Valley with bison hunters of
the High Plains. Prairie Caddoan groups also became involved prehistorically
with the Plains nomads, and through them, with the pueblo peoples.
The mutual exchange continued throughout the historic period. Formalized"
trade with the Indians became so important to the U. S. Government that considerable capital was invested in building an economic dependency with both the
nomads and village farmers. By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, this mutualism expanded eastward as the Southern Plains Indians became
the major suppliers of horses, hides, and tallow to the U. S~ Government trading
companies (Peake 1954). The U. S. Government furnished the goods necessary
for the continuation, and eventual overexploitation, of the hide and tallowyielding animals. While generating a market for the trade items, the U. S. and
Mexican trade supplies also were directly responsible for creating a unique
historic Native American Southern Plains culture that is represented
archeologically as the Southern Plains equestrian nomad archeological complex.

New Light on Old Art: Recent Advances in Hanter-Gatherer Rock Art
Research, edited by David S. Whitley and Lawrence L. Loendorf.
Monograph 36. Institute of Archaeology, University of California, Los
Angeles. 1994. 121 pages, figures and plates.
Reviewed by David G. Robinson, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
The editors of this volume are overly modest. They claim that this collection
of papers in UCLA’s Institute of Archaeology Monograph series is an attempt to
move rock art off the cover and into the book. By this they mean the treatment of
rock art as the subject of serious study rather than as, literally, striking cover art
for archeological reports within which the rock art receives no further treatment.
Instead, these collected papers are an advance in archeological studies and
concerns. Technological and theoretical changes have made this possible, in part
because rock art is now directly datable by radiocarbon and cation ratio methods.
In the arena of theory, the post-processual critique eschews the narrow
adaptationalist approaches of the New Archeology and calls for the reintroduction of humanist research interests into archeology. As Earle (pp. vii-viii) puts it
in the Preface, "No field offers better opportunities [given the new direct dating
possibilities] than the systematic research on rock art."
Rock art studies are well poised to take advantage of these possibilities.
With the test cases brought forward in this volume, they are rapidly contributing
to the study and understanding of prehistoric ideology and socio-cultural organization, as well as specific issues such as gender studies and the identification and
elucidation of shamanic complexes in hunter-gatherer societies. Wisely, the
editors have organized the chapters into two parts: the technological analysis of
rock art, primarily the new dating techniques; and the advanced cultural and
humanistic interpretations of rock art styles.
It is in the technical analysis papers of Part I that New Light on Old Art
represents a generational advance in rock art studies. The paper by Ctottes is a
summary which outlines a methodological approach, showing how parietal art
can be tied into regional sequences, in this case southwestern France. There, rock
art is a full partner in the construction of regional sequences, a happy circumstance not enjoyed by rock art in North America, where it languishes in secondclass status. Clottes shows how the prospect of direct radiocarbon dating of the
art may exalt it to leadership in refining regional cultural sequences. The chapter
by Chaffee et al. is a clear explication of their technique for extracting organic
carbon from minute pigment samples and gaining assays by accelerator mass
spectrometry. Unlike many methodological contributions, theirs gets down to

cases by presenting some of the initial results gained by the technique, from Utah
and the Lower Pecos region of Texas. This article should be consulted by anyone
contemplating dating rock art in this fashion.
The chapters by Dorn and Francis are related in that they both deal with
cation ratio dating of rock art. Dorn’s marvelously illustrated article is a compendium of virtually all North American studies of the various rock varnishes,
crusts, and patinas which may form over petroglyphs. He goes on to chart all the
techniques of age estimation which may be feasible once a coating appears on the
art, ranging from relative thickness, to Potassium-Argon, and radiocarbon dating
(varnishes cover and entrap organic matter on the rock surface beneath them), in
addition to cation ratio dating (the cations of potassium and calcium decrease
relative to those of titanium in varnishes over time). Francis’ article is a copiously illustrated (although surely Figure 4.13 is a joke) case study of the application of cation ratio dating to a regional art style, and a good example of where
one can go interpretively with a rock art sequence, once relative and absolute
dates have been established. Her subject art style is the Dinwoody Tradition rock
art of northwestern Wyoming, and her chapter is a smooth lead-in to the interpretive articles of Part II.
The interpretive chapters of New Light on Old Art commence with Ritter’s
exhaustive element analysis of scratched rock complexes in western Nevada. He
arrives at interpretive conclusions by the testing of alternative hypotheses, ultimately prefering a neuropsychological model, wherein the artworks were executed while in, or depicting, the trance state. The article by Bass is a foray into
gender issues in prehistoric art. Her thoughtful study shows how rock art can
address current issues in social and critical anthropology, boldly ignoring North
American archeology’s general reluctance to do the same. Her de-gendering of
the Pecos River style art, and the breadth of her conclusions, are puzzling,
however. The Red Linear style of the same Lower Pecos region is full of gender
representations: images of gender, sex, sexuality, and reproduction are frequent,
central, often rampant. Here is the ground for gender studies of Lower Pecos rock
art; I sense the beginnings of an overworked data set. Still, I applaud Bass’s
willingness to engage the big picture. Turpin’s article establishes the werecougar as a motif in Pecos River style art and in the ancient shamanic complex.
The importance of the article is in seating the Pecos River style and its practitioners within the global system of shamanism as described ethnographically and
ethnohistorically.
The interpretive chapters end with Whitley’s and Loendorf’s papers; their
thorough scholarship efforts are clearly the show pieces of the volume. Whitley
applies the neuropsychological model and entoptic phenomena, as expressed in
California rock art, to linguistic groupings; the chapter is a virtual analytic tour
de force. Loendorf’s task is largely to show how rock art research can and should
be incorporated into the conduct of general archeological analysis. He ranges
over North American rock art to demonstrate with several test cases how the
depiction and context of rock art can add to analytic findings in other data

Reviews

337

categories. Rock art can even suggest new research directions when compared to
those findings.
Albeit a generational leap, this monograph is not without flaws. If the
compendium has taken the next step in rock art research, then the next step after
that is crediting one’s illustrators. Although exceptionally well illustrated, the
volume virtually ignores the researchers who worked to transfer the aboriginal
imagery to the publishing format. The general acknowledgments credit Janet
Lever, whose tracing became the cover art. Clottes gives gracious accreditations,
along with the techniques used (tracings in his case). Otherwise, no credit is
given for scores of photographs, drawings, and tracings. Ritter has a photograph
(Figure 5.3) of the recording team in action at a site, but he does not name the
person responsible for converting the scale drawings into the pen and ink drawings actually published. I found myself wanting to learn more about the CAD
diagrams Dorn made from his photomicrographs of rock varnishes. Although
credited, Bass’s drawings are sketchy. Turpin receives a special note for her
thoughtlessness.
This is not a trivial complaint. Noting the photographer, illustrator, and the
techniques of recording, gives readers some indication of the integrity of an
image in its many transformations and transmissions from the external environment to the published book. Is the imagery accurate? A brief statement about the
rock art recording in captions, a la Clottes, is sufficient in most cases to answer
this question.
This issue aside, or perhaps because of it, this volume should be read,
studied, and enjoyed by as many readers as can order it from UCLA. New Light
on Old Art in the future will be considered a monument and a milestone of rock
art research.

Abandonment of Settlements and Regions: Ethnoarchaeological and Archaeological Approaches, edited by Catherine M. Cameron and Steve A. Tomka.
Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. 1993. xv + 201 pp.
Reviewed by G. Lain Ellis, Texas Historical Commission
Catherine Cameron and Steve Tomka have assembled a suite of studies of
interest to archeologists who study how people use landscapes. Most of the
volume consists of ethnoarcheological and archeological symposium papers describing abandonment behavior. Building on research into site-formation, mobility, and curation (Schiffer and Binford are heavily cited), the contributors
individually and collectively demonstrate that "abandonment" is a complex topic.
A major strength of the volume is that it presents an array of different but
complementary aspects of abandonment. As a result, the volume is a very useful
conceptual guide in addition to being a compact resource for empirical observations about abandonment°

338

Texas Archeological Society

The largest part of the book contains ethnoarcheological papers about
regional abandonment. As Cameron notes in her introduction, "regional
abandonment" refers here to local abandonments occurring within a regional
settlement system, and not to regional depopulation. Tomka’s paper on Bolivian
agro-pastoralists distinguishes between permanent abandonment (leaving a site
with no intention to return) and episodic abandonment (planned departure with
the intention to return when circumstances permit). With permanent
abandonment, assemblages are small and heavily depleted, whereas episodic
abandonment results in large assemblages with a wide range of usable goods. As
the length of time to reoccupation increases, the site’s owners return to retrieve
cached goods for use at other locations. This form of delayed curation replenishes
the inventory in use at current residences.
Martha Graham’s chapter on the Raramuri (Tarahumara) identifies punctuated abandonment as a form of planned departure with anticipated return. The
Raramuri are agro-pastoralists who maintain seasonally occupied main, winter,
and agricultural residences. The content of the assemblage curated at abandonment depends largely on what already lies cached at the new residence, and on
the intention to return. Since most moves involve an intent to return the next
season, goods available at the next !ocation are cached so they will be available
when the site is reoccupied. When a site is permanently abandoned, all usable
items may be curated, including the house itself.
Susan Kent’s chapter on the Khutse area of Botswana is a study of Basarwa
and Bakgalagadi foragers who seldom establish residences at previously occupied sites. Hence, all abandonments are permanent. The number of artifacts
entering a destination site depends on how long the occupants intend to stay, and
seems to be unaffected by the actual length of occupancy. The number of bones
visible during occupation is relatively small, but increases as people relax their
maintenance routines as abandonment nears. Since return is not anticipated,
caching is rare, although scavenging at abandoned sites may be common.
Two ethnoarcheological chapters deal only indirectly with the archeological implications of regional abandonment. In comparisons of Kofya and Tiv (Nigeria) and German and Finnish farmers, Glenn Stone argues that cultural
attitudes toward agricultural work can lead to highly divergent patterns of occupation and abandonment among groups living in the same environment, and
even in the same places. Lee Home’s study of agro-pastoral villages in northern Iran shows that village occupation is highly dependent on the presence of
individuals who are willing and able to coordinate irrigation network maintenance. Juxtaposing chapters dealing mostly with cultural and political-economic
variables with other chapters dominated by subsistence behavior, rounds out a
series of important contrasts.
The content of abandonment assemblages (the flip side of the curation coin)
is conditioned by the anticipation of return or permanent abandonment. When
return is anticipated, the primary influence on curation is the availability of
cached goods at the destination sites. Permanent abandonment may leave few

Reviews

339

usable goods, and cached goods may be left behind inadvertently. In Kent’s
study, abandonment assemblages also are depleted partly because the assemblage used during occupation was small to begin with. The assemblage of a
permanently abandoned site need not reflect the spatial distribution of actual
activity areas. Reoccupation of an area need not result in. reoccupation of sites,
and abandoning a site need not involve abandoning the nearby landscape as a
productive area. Abandonment by agriculturists need not be related to exhaustion
of agricultural potential. Thus, a major theme in these chapters is that peoples’
perceptions determine how they use and abandon sites and, hence, the content
and distribution of things they leave behind. Another major theme is that people
may abandon sites in complex ways. These themes appear in three archeological
studies examining regional abandonment at different scales.
Relying on tree-ring analyses, Sarah Schlanger and Richard Wilhulsen
reconstruct fine-grained cycles of Anasazi occupation and abandonment in the
Dolores area of southwest Colorado. The authors correlate individual house
construction events with climatic, and other, evidence. Although their use of
"vv" dates may justify rejecting many of their construction dates and, hence,
some of their empirical conclusions, the authors nonetheless argue persuasively
that an analysis of regional abandonment is only as sound as the links established
between the local details of abandonment and the variables one believes to be
responsible for it. Moreover, they argue that differences between regional abandonment, as defined above, and depopulation may show up partly in the amount
of usable goods remaining in abandoned houses since no one is around to engage
in delayed curation after depopulation. Thus, depopulation is a special case of
regional abandonment in which few destination sites are in the same region.
The destination component of abandonment is a major focus in a study of
Classic Hohokam settlement in the northern Tucson basin by Suzanne Fish and
Paul Fish. Preclassic settlements were fairly widely dispersed in communities
centered around villages with ballcourts, although a trend toward aggregation
was evident by A.D. 1100-1150. In the early Classic (A.D. 1150-1300), two
communities in the northern basin coalesced into a single community (Marana),
with evidence of high population (some from abandoned Preclassic settlements)
and expansion of agriculture into sub-optimal niches. By A.D. 1350, the Marana
community was completely abandoned, with populations aggregating to the
north and south in extremely large late Classic communities that grew from
already aggregated early Classic communities. Marana abandonment does not
seem to result from agricultural failure, especially since the Marana area was
exploited after abandonment. Late Classic "mega-aggregation" appears to be
predicated on earlier aggregation-related development of social and economic
structures capable of absorbing people abandoning Marana. Thus, the authors see
Marana abandonment as a largely socially driven event made possible by social
and economic developments in destination communities.
Katina Lillios’ chapter on the Copper Age to Bronze Age transition in
Portugal is an interesting, and appropriately broadly cast, application of theory

340

Texas Archeological Society

and analogy to the issue of regional abandonment. Copper Age settlement
conformed to a center-periphery pattern in which wealthier sites were concentrated along the Atlantic coast, and poorer sites were dispersed in the interior
lowlands. Amphibolite, a raw material valued for tools and ritual objects, was
closer to the periphery sites, but amphibolite artifacts were concentrated in the
center sites. Lillios argues that amphibolite trade linked center and periphery,
and that growing competition among center-based exchange alliances for access
to periphery resources led to environmental degradation in both center and
periphery, and to the breakdown of the exchange alliances. Given the operation
of different processes in the center and periphery, results of Copper to Bronze
Age abandonment were different, most notably with a shift from clustered to
dispersed settlement in the center, but maintenance of dispersed settlement in
the periphery.
Two ethnoarcheological chapters focus on abandonment within sites. One
of these is an examination of Zuni farming villages by Nan Rothschild and others. The authors creatively characterize abandonment as a reversible multi-stage
continuum. On this continuum, full-time use is the lowest abandonment value
that can be assigned to a structure on a scale whose highest value is permanent
abandonment. Casting abandonment this way is valuable because it conceptualizes the use of individual structures and occupation of settlements as a matter
of degree rather than a binary condition. Between the extremes are other states
which range from part-time use to no use other than a sign saying that others
may not build here. The authors document cases of architectural deterioration
(and renewa!) and artifact distributions that go along with these states. Although
the artifact discussions seem unfocused and weak, the discussion of architecture shows that their conceptualization of abandonment is realistic and viable.
Arthur Joyce and Sissel Johannessen examine a household abandoned by a
family in La Concha, Oaxaca. The household consisted of a compound with four
structures and outdoor activity areas. Each of the structures was treated differently on departure so that examining any single structure would lead to different
conclusions about the nature of abandonment. One intact structure, a kitchen,
appears to reflect unplanned departure. Another intact structure, a residence with
a shrine, appears to represent planned departure, with caches implying an
intention to return for reoccupation or to retrieve usable goods. Two other
structures were dismantled and depleted of structural elements, and contained
different amounts of abandonment refuse. Since abandonment was planned and
gradual, the compound shows that abandonment of multi-structure households
can yield complexly structured remains depending on intentions to return,
security of cached goods, and the amount of time taken to move goods to the
destination residence.
Three archeological chapters discuss household abandonment. Barbara
Montgomery uses the Relative Room Abandonment Measure (RRAM) to study
room abandonment at Chodistaas, a thirteenth century pueblo near Grasshopper
Pueblo in Arizona. The RRAM uses the frequency of floor pots and the density

Reviews

34 !

of sherds in room fill as a regression-like index yielding relative dates for room
abandonment. Montgomery modifies the RRAM into a matrix-analysis tool for
performing the additional task of identifying abandonment processes. This adaptation provides a highly plausible basis for concluding that the Chodistaas RRAM
results from intentionally burying rooms after abandonment. However, she may
not see that her study radically alters the RRAM because she implicitly demonstrates that sequential room abandonment, like intentional burial, must be shown
to account for RRAM before it can be used as a relative-dating index. This
observation would reinforce her already sound recommendation that abandonment processes be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.
In a related vein, Ricky Lightfoot looks at abandonment of suites of rooms
at the Duckfoot site in southwestern Colorado. On the basis of sherds in midden
contexts, Lightfoot derives estimates of the numbers and types of vessels expected in systemic context. These estimates serve as an index against which to
compare the content of ceramic assemblages recovered from room contexts. One
architectural suite has an assemblage that is close to expected values, whereas
another suite is heavily depleted in almost all vessel categories. A third suite falls
between these extremes. Lightfoot concludes that this pattern, when interpreted
along with other lines of evidence, reflects differential abandonment rates, with
the most depleted suite being the most gradually abandoned.
Robert Brooks’ chapter on household abandonment at Plains Village settlements focuses on criteria for determining whether a floor assemblage reflects a
spatial patterning of activities. In five Washita River phase houses at a village in
south central Oklahoma, four appear to reflect gradual, planned abandonment.
The houses appear to have been dismantled, and their floor assemblages consist
of relatively small artifacts (with few refits) distributed around the house edges
or in internal postholes. In contrast, the fifth house was destroyed in situ by fire,
and contained a relatively large floor assemblage (with many refit pieces) in
which functionally related items are clustered near each other. Given the presence of a partial burial in the house, it is possible that the death of a child
precipitated a hasty abandonment of this house. Brooks concludes that only the
fifth house has sufficient assemblage integrity to use spatial clustering of artifacts to infer activity areas.
In the closing chapter, Tomka and Marc Stevenson note that the term
"abandonment" in archeology typically means "permanent abandonment," and
that this meaning belies the underlying complexity of how people stop using
places. They also note that abandonment studies have a long way to go in terms
of empirical studies and how we conceptualize the real differences between, say,
curation, delayed curation, and scavenging, or residential mobility and sedentism.
In effect, these papers vividly illustrate that sedentism is simply a very low value
on the mobility scale, and even sedentism involves highly localized abandonment processes as activities and residences shift location within and around a
settlement. Interestingly, although only one chapter covers hunter-gatherers, the
papers show that concepts derived largely for hunter-gatherer studies have high

342

Texas Archeological Society

interpretive value when applied creatively to groups with other subsistence
bases.
To paraphrase Bertrand Russell, unexamined assumptions about abandonment are to archeology what theft is to hard work. This volume successfully
demonstrates that failing to account explicitly for the details of abandonment is
equivalent to assuming away the problematic relations between systemic and
archeological contexts. It also demonstrates that identifying the conditions of
abandonment is hard work that can be satisfying to analyst and reader alike.
Abandonment begins at home, and making a case about the conditions of abandonment is a necessary foundation for well supported claims about other aspects
of prehistory.

The Meeting of Two Worlds: Europe and the Americas 1492-1650, edited by
Warwick Bray. Published for the British Academy by Oxford University
Press, Oxford. 1993. 336 pp.
Prepared from a one-day symposium held by the British Academy to commemorate the Columbian Quincentenary, this edited volume’s main focus is
the consequences of the European conquest of the New World, most especially
on the native peoples of Latin America, during what Bray defines (p. 2) as
the early colonial period (1492-1650). Thus, its thematic approach is on the
conflicts and interactions between Europeans and Native Americans, and the
"process of adaptation and syncretism" that created new criollo cultures that
are distinctively American in character.
The Meeting of Two Worlds employs archeological, ethnohistorical, historical/documentary, geographic, and demographic research to form the tapestry of the text, and the scope and quality of the papers provides the reader with
a real sense of how and why the process of contact between Native Americans
and Europeans took the course it did. Given its focus on the "Columbian Exchange" (cf. Crosby 1972), there are obligatory papers by Brothwell ("On Biological Exchanges between the Two Worlds"), Newson ("The Demographic
Collapse of Native Peoples of the Americas, 1492-1650), and Bray ("Crop Plants
and Cannibals: Early European Impressions of the New World") that discuss
the biological and cultural consequences of contact.
Other papers in the volume focus on particular aspects of contact and the
character of Native American lifeways, principally in terms of native responses
to conquest and settlement, but also in concert with an analysis (and appreciation) of the types of military, organizational, entrepreneurial, and diplomatic
skills brought to bear by Europeans during colonial rule. As Newson (p. 247)
suggests, Native American survival in the face of demographic collapse had
much to do with "the more subtle demographic effects of changes to native
economies, societies and beliefs.., influenced by the different methods employed to exploit and convert the native population .... [and] the size and
character of native societies at the time of contact and the demand for resources
in the regions in which they lived."

Sacred Sites, Sacred Places, edited by David L. Carmichael, Jane Hubert, Brian
Reeves, and Audhild Schanche. One World Archaeology 23. Routledge,
London and New York. 1994. xxiv + 300 pp.
Some of the most difficult and demanding challenges for North American
archeologists today, especially so in Texas, are to develop appropriate ways to
effectively interact with Native Americans about the study, management, and
protection of their cultural heritage, and to communicate and share information
and concerns about the "kinds of places important to people of different cultures,
and why" (p. 1). Sacred Sites, Sacred Places is thus a very timely and useful
compendium, one organized around the theme of identifying, preserving, and
interpreting sacred sites.
Sacred sites include much more than burial sites or human remains. Generally speaking, sacred sites are those places that have spiritual significance or
power to the people who created them or imbued them with meaning, such as
"transformer sites, spirit residences, ceremonial areas, traditional landmarks,
questing sites, legendary and mythological places, burial sites and traditional
resource areas" (pp. 4-5). Among the Mescalero Apache, for instance, Carmichael
documents certain peaks, caves, springs, burials, and sweatlodges (including the
Holy Lodge used in Girls’ Puberty ceremonies) as sacred sites and places of
power, few of much are marked by any physical remains. Among the Maori of
New Zealand, sacred sites (waahi tapu) are places associated with death; altars;
sources of water for healing and death rituals; sacred pathways for messengers;
mountains, rivers, lakes, and springs; as well as certain stones and trees.
The papers in the volume address four main topics: (a) the nature of sacred
places, (b) the question of ownership and management of sacred places and
sacred geography/landscapes (i.e., sacred sites as part of a related set of powerful
places that encompass broad landscapes), (c) the prospects for future progress in
properly protecting sacred sites, and (d) how important it is for archeologists and
native peoples to develop cooperative relationships "to protect sacred sites and to
educate others about the importance of sacred places" (p. 7). There is much to
ponder and consider in this volume, particularly in light of the poor record of
North American archeology and many North American archeologists in understanding the sacred sites and places of Native Americans, and the lamentable
lack of use of much of our historic preservation laws in protecting sacred sites
when it is prudent and feasible to do so. I encourage archeologists in Texas to
read and absorb Sacred Sites, Sacred Places.

El Rancho in South Texas: Continuity and Change from 1750, by Joe S.
Graham. University of North Texas Press, Denton. 1994. x + 12! pp.
This is a wonderful and well-illustrated book. The architectural and structural photographs of nineteenth and twentieth century jacals, stone ranchhouses

Book No~s

345

(casa mayors), wells, corrals de lena, ranching equipment, and roundups are
worth the price of the book alone, and should be quite a useful reference to
historic archeologists working in South Texas.
El Rancho is based on an exhibit, held in 1994 at the John E. Connor
Museum in Kingsville, Texas, on the history of the private cattle ranch or rancho
from 1750 to the present in South Texas. During the almost 250 years of private cattle ranching in the South Texas region, ranching as "the basis for civilization and culture" (p. ix) has been transformed from its roots in Spanish/
Mexican cultural traditions (dating back centuries) in architecture, the hacienda
social structure, cattle tending and water production, and the work roles and
lifeways of the vaquero. Now, the modern Anglo-American cattle ranch is more
than a traditional way of life, it is a profit-making and market-oriented business
industry. Meanwhile, the vaqueros and cowboys, such a distinctive part of
American culture, continue to work on the private cattle ranches (like the King
Ranch, Randado’s Ranch, and Alta Vista Ranch featured in the book) that are
so characteristic a part of the history and settlement of South Texas.
Graham provides the context for understanding the history of the ranch in
South Texas by first discussing the Spanish exploration and settlement of Texas,
then examining the institution of ranching in Spain and Mexico, before el rancho
moved north of the Rio Grande in 1750. As he makes clear, the ranch was the
primary cultural tradition by which the South Texas border area was settled in
colonial times. Graham then continues the story by discussing how the cattle
ranches were modernized, and then after 1930 how they became incorporated
in large agribusinesses. After 1848, Anglo-American settlement in South Texas
greatly increased, and men such as Richard King and Charles Stillman married
into landed families in the region, eventually helping to change the cattle ranch
into a big business (with a community hierarchy resembling that of the Spanish
and Mexican hacendados) with national markets. Fencing of the open range,
new cattle breeds, windmills and drilling rigs, and the development of modern
transportation facilities, the oil boom, paved roads, and vehicles complete the
modernization and expansion of the private cattle ranch.
This book should greatly increase appreciation of the role Spanish/Mexican
cattle ranching has played in forming the diverse cultural heritage of Texas. It is
reasonably priced, and well worth the read.

Practices of Archaeological SO’atigraphy, edited by Edward C. Harris, Marley
R. Brown III, and Gregory J. Brown. Academic Press, London. 1993. viii +
296 pp.
The Harris Matrix concept, developed by Edward Harris (1979), represents
a different and systematic way to diagram and interpret archeological stratigraphy, one that has found useful applications in a variety of prehistoric and historical archeological sites across the world, albeit not without controversy raised

346

Texas Archeological Society

by some geoarcheologists and archeologists. This edited volume by Harris,
Brown, and Brown has two main purposes: (1) to promote and advocate (somewhat stridently) the use of the Harris Matrix method for depicting archeological
stratigraphy, and (2) to provide archeological research case studies from North
America, Central America, and Europe that illustrate the interpretive potential
of this type of method. Fortunately for the reader, the book’s latter purpose is
more successfully realized than the former; there is grist for the Texas’ archeological stratigraphers mill here.
The Harris Matrix is a four-dimensional model (thickness, length, width,
and time) of archeological stratigraphy that is presented diagrammatically. It is
predicated on an important shift in perspective, from the vertical view of stratigraphy (the standing profile) to the "open-area" or horizontal excavation of a site.
From this view, interfaces (that is, the area of the surface of a deposit, or features, or face of a wall) and single context plans (as in a stratigraphic unit of a
particular character and size) can be viewed in a way more compatible with how
a site "developed, i.e., by a topographical, superimposed, accretion of strata and
interfaces, and mirrors the manner in which we should excavate them, not from
the side (as in a sectional viewpoint), but from top to bottom, from late to early
by the stratigraphic method of removing the later layers first" (p. 5).
Following an introductory paper by Marley Brown and Harris on interfaces
in archeological stratigraphy, the remainder of the book is organized into sections on historical trends, analysis in excavation, phasing and structural analysis, post-excavation analysis, and future developments. Papers that best convey
the merits of the Harris Matrix method, and seem to offer analogs for use in
archeological sites in Texas, include: Stucki’s on an assessment of activity areas within a shell midden; Gregory Brown and Muraca’s on phasing stratigraphic sequences at Colonial Williamsburg; and papers by Gerrard and Triggs
on interpreting the complex nature of stratigraphic sequences from Fort York
and Fort Frontenac as well as evaluating the chronological character of historic
ceramics from each site’s artifact-bearing deposits.

Disease and Social Diversity: The European Impact on the Health of NonEuropeans, by Stephen J. Kunitz. Oxford University Press, New York.
1994. xi + 209 pp.
As archeologists, anthropologists, and others increasingly turn away from
the idea that contact between Europeans and non-Europeans in the Americas
and Oceania uniformly resulted in catastrophic population collapses following
the introduction of new European diseases among the latter groups (for a forceful
treatise on the subject, see Stannard [1992]), they would do well to consider the
views and persuasive arguments regarding disease and social diversity put forth
by Kunitz in this book. Basically, Kunitz examines from an epidemiological and

Book Notes

347

socio-political perspective how diverse social institutions and cultural behaviors
among Native Americans (particularly the Navajo and Hopi), and indigineous
peoples of Oceania and Polynesia, have shaped patterns of death and disease in
populations.
Kunitz builds his case by using historical records and modern health data
for native populations from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the southwestern United States, then factoring in the effects on health and different types of
European contact. From this perspective, then, he looks for concordance, or
more significantly lack of concordance, between the overall disease experience
and historical and current disease patterns of these indigineous peoples.
In the author’s view, the impacts of European contact on the health of
indigineous populations across the world has varied tremendously, depending
upon the specific colonial, medical, and resettlement policies of European governments, as well as the cultural and social organization of the non-European
groups. Like Young (see below), Kunitz argues forcefully that without understanding both the socio-political and cultural context (at local and national
levels), as well as the biology and etiology of specific diseases, it is not possible to fully comprehend the morbidity and mortality of different infectious
and chronic diseases among non-Europeans over time. In sum, he suggests that
there was a range of responses to epidemic diseases, and that "in general the
most devastating contact situations seem to have been associated with dispossession from the land. Not all natives dropped dead whenever they got down
wind of a European" (p. 178). There is no simple truth here.

Skeletal Biology in the Great Plains: Migration, Warfare, Health, and Subsistence, edited by Douglas W. Owsley and Richard L. Jantz. Smithsonian
Institution Press, Washington, D.C. 1994. xii + 415 pp.
This book, more than any other bioarcheological or archeological book that
has been published in the last few years, is so much a product of the changes
seen in these disciplines as a result of the repatriation and reburia! of Native
American skeletal remains and associated grave goods. The impetus for most
of the research was the analysis of the William H. Over skeletal collection from
the Central and Northern Plains shortly before it was due to be reburied.
Reading this scholarly volume, one sees and appreciates the tremendous
amount of knowledge gained within the last decade about Native American
demography and paleopathology, biological distance relationships, subsistence
changes, and prehistoric warfare on the Great Plains from the study of skeletal
biology. Thus, hopefully these words in the Preface by Owsley and Jantz (p.
xii) can be heeded:

348

Texas Archeological Society
We want to make clear that we understand the emotions and demands
of those who call for prompt repatriation, but, as scientists, we ask for
the understanding of Native Americans. It is our hope that research...
will continue to contribute to an improved understanding of Native
Americans and that it will benefit them and others in the human community as well.
As scientists, we are aware that the loss of collections may hamper
the continuation of research that we consider vital to the Native American community and to society at large. To prevent such a loss, it is our
view that professional curation and study should precede the repatriation process. Otherwise, the education of future generations, full of
questions, will be limited to our present store of knowledge and restricted by our inaccuracies and omissions.

This book is simply packed with interesting and enlightening papers on the
archeology, burial archeology, and bioarcheology of the Native Americans who
lived on the Great Plains of North America. The 32 chapters range over a
multitude of issues and research problems regarding the region’s skeletal biology
and prehistory, with a special focus on the Northern and Central Plains. Of
particular interest to this reviewer were: (a) the series of papers on stable isotope
analysis of human bone for assessments of Native American subsistence and
diet; (b) the papers considering evidence for plains warfare; and (c) the succinct
overview of Great Plains human skeletal biology by Douglas H. Ubelaker that
closes the book.
The only complaint I have with the book is that the archeological treatment
of the Southern Plains, which focuses on the Plains Village and Protohistoric
periods ("Southern Plains Cultural Complexes" by Robert L. Brooks) ignores
most of the relevant archeological sites and remains from Texas other than those
of the Antelope Creek phase in the Panhandle. This is a serious omission given
the known Late Prehistoric archeological record of the upper Red River, the
Llano Estacado, the Caprock Canyonlands, and the Rolling Plains (cf. Hofman et
al. 1989; Johnson 1992; Boyd et al. 1993). Other than this, professional and
avocational archeologists alike in Texas should find much of interest in this
volume, from ideas to ponder to research agendas to develop, and I strongly
recommend that the book become a mainstay in research libraries.

Turquoise Ridge and Late Prehistoric Residential Mobility in the Desert
Mogollon Region, by Michael E. Whalen. University of Utah Press, Salt
Lake City. 1994. xii + 160 pp.
This monograph presents the research results of Whalen’s intensive excavations and feature/material culture analysis at the Turquoise Ridge site in the

Book Notes

349

Hueco Bolson of the Jornada Mogollon area. The Turquoise Ridge site, not far
from the Hueco Mountains and about 30 km northeast of E1 Paso, is a large
pithouse village occupied between ca. A.D. 500-1000, perhaps one of the largest
"Formative" period sites (or Mesilla phase in local parlance) in the region. Given
the limited number of published reports on excavations at Formative sites in
western Texas and south-central New Mexico, Whalen’s report is a welcome
addition to the regional archeological literature.
Whalen’s excavations and research perspectives focus on the role of residential mobility in determining the character of cultural adaptations in the Jornada
Mogollon, as seen through the study of site occupational histories. His work at
Turquoise Ridge suggests that hunting-gathering populations began to establish
winter base camps along the upper edges of the intermontane desert basins (and
along the Rio Grande) as populations began to increase regionally. Also, these
groups were sustained by increased use of large-scale extramural storage pits
filled with wild plant foods (and eventually with cultigens such as maize after ca.
A.D. 750), and by the use of baking pits for the bulk processing of desert
succulents. During the warm seasons, groups dispersed to forage through the Rio
Grande valley and the drier desert basins.
At Turquoise Ridge, the populations lived as small family households in
small pithouse villages; some 15-27 pithouses were identified at the site. One
large non-residential or communal pithouse structure was constructed at the site
after ca. A.D. 750, and this structure may be a reflection of the development of
some sort of corporate or group-level social organization at that time. Whalen
suggests that the pithouses were occupied for perhaps as long as three or four
months at a time. That the occupations were intensive at Turquoise Ridge is
apparent by the number and variety of house features, the storage facilities, and
the numerous well-defined trash middens. Similar kinds of sites, although rare,
are known in the Rio Grande valley (Los Tules, Hatch, and Rincon) and along
the edges of the Tularosa Basin.
In addition to the engaging discussion of Jornada Mogollon residential
mobility and cultural adaptations, the Turquoise Ridge monograph contains
thorough discussions of: site dating/chronological concerns; structures, features,
and use of site space; ceramic and lithic technology and function; and analyses of
plant remains and animal bones. Of particular interest is Whalen’s concise
presentation of the close interval (2-4 m) bucket soil augering approach used at
the site to successfully define the location of buried features, structures, and
other subsurface remains.

The Health of Native Americans: Towards a Biocultural Epidemiology, by T.
Kue Young. Oxford University Press, New York. 1994. ix + 275 pp.
Young’s book examines the evolution and current patterns of health and
disease among Native Americans, taking both an epidemiological and

350

Texas Archeological Society

anthropological view of disease and health conditions in these populations. His
basic point is that to understand long and short-term changes in health and
population sizes among Native Americans, indeed among any group, it is
important to consider and integrate the cultural context of disease (and its effects
on populations), because "regional variation can be demonstrated in almost all
diseases...reflecting the differences in genetic makeup, cultural background,
ecological habits, and social circumstances" (p. 224). Focusing on both biological
and cultural issues offers a broad and promising approach to the examination of
disease causation among Native Americans.
Beginning with an overview of Native American population and health, the
heart of the book deals principally with fairly recent trends (twentieth century)
and conditions of disease and health in three categories: infectious diseases (such
as tuberculosis, pneumonia, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases, etc.),
chronic diseases (including cancer, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity), and
injuries and the social pathologies (namely suicide, homicide, alcohol and substance abuse, etc.). As Young’s comprehensive discussion makes plain, the
overall health status of Native Americans in North America is poor compared
to all-race national populations in Canada and the United States, particularly
with respect to the rise of chronic, non-communicable diseases, accidents, violent deaths, and homicide, and because of the persistence of low levels of infectious diseases.
He attributes the current character of Native American health to rapid
changes in lifestyles (especially dietary habits and levels of physical activity),
and the wide gap between Native Americans and non-Native Americans in such
socio-economic indicators as income levels, housing, social assistance, and children in care. Nevertheless, the health of Native Americans has seemingly improved over the last 40 years or so, which Young suggests has resulted from
national public health intervention programs provided by centralized health service systems. While the benefits of these programs may be many, although slow
in coming, it is clearly still the case that the deleterious effects of culture contact
and interaction between Native Americans and European peoples remain pervasive and long-lasting.
