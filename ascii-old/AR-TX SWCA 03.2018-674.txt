Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for Portions of the Proposed Shin Oak Pipeline Project
on University of Texas Lands

ABSTRACT
On behalf of Enterprise Products Operating, LLC (Enterprise), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey on a portion of the proposed 117.0-mile-long
(188.29-kilometer [km]) pipeline through Reeves, Loving, Winkler, Ector, and Midland Counties, Texas.
Enterprise proposes to construct, install, and maintain a 24-inch diameter buried steel pipeline extending
from the Orla Cryogenic Gas Plant in Reeves County to the proposed High Plains facility in Midland
County. In Winkler County the line traverses 4.07 miles while in Ector County the line traverses
1.06 miles for a total of 5.13 miles of lands managed by the University of Texas. This includes parcels
0011.000.00.00-WK-TX, 0012.000.00.00-WK-TX, 0013.000.00.00-WK-TX, 0014.000.00.00-WK-TX,
0015.000.00.00-WK-TX, and 0015B.000.00.00-WK-TX in Winkler County and parcel 0023.000.00.00EC-TX.
SWCA conducted an intensive pedestrian survey within a 300-foot-wide corridor centered on the
approximately 5.13-mile-long proposed pipeline centerline on University Lands. This resulted in a total
of 194.20 acres being surveyed; 155.59 in Winkler County and 38.61 in Ector County. During the course
of the survey, SWCA excavated 202 shovel tests. The proposed project includes a 30-foot-wide
permanent right-of-way easement, a 20-to-70-ft wide temporary construction easement, and additional
temporary workspace. Construction activities will take place within a corridor ranging between 70 and
100 feet wide in areas with additional temporary workspace. Depths of impact are anticipated to range
from 3 to 5 feet.
Cultural resources investigations were conducted on the public lands to comply with the Antiquities Code
of Texas, as the agencies administering those lands are political subdivisions of the State of Texas.
Additionally, as the project is subject to FERC review and the project may cross waters of the U.S. under
jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, work was performed in support of EPNG’s compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (54 U.S.C. 306108) and its implementing
regulations (36 Code of Federal Regulations 800).
Investigations included a cultural resources background review and literature search of the APE and an
intensive pedestrian survey of the APE augmented with shovel testing. SWCA’s background review
indicated that 4 previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted within a 1-mile radius of the APE;
one of which is adjacent to (within 300 feet of) a portion of the APE in Winkler County. The review also
indicates that two previously recorded archaeological sites are within a 1-mile buffer of the APE;
41WK20 and 41WK49. Both sites have previously been determined not eligible for listing in the NRHP
or a designated state antiquities landmark (SAL).
SWCA identified two previously undocumented cultural resources during the course of this survey,
41EC31 and 41WK117. Both sites are small, historic artifact scatters that date to the middle of the 1900s.
Based on the lack of features and subsurface deposits, as well as the limited research potential presented
by the sites, SWCA recommends neither site eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or for designation as a
SAL. In accordance with the ACT and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, SWCA has
made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural resources within the investigated project area.
Based on the survey findings, the project will have no adverse effect on cultural resources that warrant
SAL designation or are listed on, or eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. SWCA recommends that no
further archaeological investigations within the project area are warranted, and the project should be
allowed to proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Enterprise Products Operating, LLC (Enterprise), SWCA Environmental Consultants
(SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey on a portion of the proposed 117.0-mile-long
(188.29-kilometer [km]) pipeline through Reeves, Loving, Winkler, Ector, and Midland Counties, Texas
(Figure 1). Enterprise proposes to construct, install, and maintain a 24–inch-diameter buried steel pipeline
extending from the Orla Cryogenic Gas Plant in Reeves County to the proposed High Plains facility in
Midland County. In Winkler County the line traverses 4.07 miles while in Ector County the line traverses
1.06 miles for a total of 5.13 miles of lands managed by the University of Texas. This includes parcels
0011.000.00.00-WK-TX, 0012.000.00.00-WK-TX, 0013.000.00.00-WK-TX, 0014.000.00.00-WK-TX,
0015.000.00.00-WK-TX, and 0015B.000.00.00-WK-TX in Winkler County and parcel 0023.000.00.00EC-TX (Figure 2 and Figure 3).
SWCA conducted an intensive pedestrian survey within a 300-foot-wide corridor centered on the
approximately 5.13-mile-long proposed pipeline centerline on University Lands. This resulted in a
total of 194.20 acres being surveyed; 155.59 in Winkler County and 38.61 in Ector County. During the
course of the survey, SWCA excavated 202 shovel tests. The proposed project includes a 50-foot-wide
permanent right-of-way (ROW) easement, a 20 to 70-ft wide temporary construction easement, and
additional temporary workspace. Construction activities will take place within a corridor ranging between
70 and 100 feet wide in areas with additional temporary workspace. Depths of impact are anticipated to
range from 3 to 5 feet.
Cultural resources investigations were conducted on the public lands to comply with the Antiquities Code
of Texas, as the agencies administering those lands are political subdivisions of the State of Texas.
The goal of the investigation was to locate cultural resources within the APE, establish vertical and
horizontal site boundaries as appropriate, and evaluate the significance and eligibility of all recorded sites
for designation as state antiquities landmarks (SALs) and for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). This investigation, including reporting, followed the guidelines and procedures
outlined in the following documents: 1) Council of Texas Archeologists standards for cultural resources
survey; 2) Antiquities Code of Texas (and the Texas Historical Commission’s [THC’s] Rules of Practice
and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas); 3) National Historic Preservation Act (as amended);
4) Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974; 5) Archaeological Resources Protection Act of
1979, as amended (if required); 6) Title 36 of the CFR (Parts 60–66 and 800); and 7) Archeology and
Historic Preservation: The Secretary of the Interior’s Guidelines; and the FERC Guidelines for Reporting
on Cultural Resources Investigations for Natural Gas Projects (FERC 2017). This overall approach
helped to ensure that all project-related impacts were investigated thoroughly for their potential to affect
cultural resources and documented accordingly

Project Personnel
Amanda Cohen served as project manager, as well as Principal Investigator. Ashley Eyeington served
as crew chief, while Robert Brush provided field support. Antonio De Cunzo prepared the report.
Rachel Cooper processed the geographic information system (GIS) data. Lauri Logan conducted the
technical edits and formatted the report.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area within University Lands is in Winkler and Ector Counties just east of the Pecos River
(see Figure 1). The project area occurs within the Chihuahuan Deserts and Playas ecoregion (24a) of the
Chihuahuan Desert (24) and the Arid Llano Estacado ecoregion (25k) of the High Plains (25) (Griffith et
al. 2004). As such, the study area traverses portions of the Basin and Range Physiographic Province as
well as the Southern High Plains.
The physiography of the region is generally a continuation of basin and range terrain. The mountain
ranges include faulted limestone reefs, volcanoes and associated basalt, rhyolite, and tuff extrusive rocks.
The landscape is largely internally drained outside the Rio Grande and Pecos River drainages. Vegetative
cover is semi-desert grassland and arid shrubland, except for high elevation islands of oak, juniper, and
pinyon pine woodland. The extent of desert shrubland is increasing across lowlands and mountain
foothills due to gradual desertification caused in part by historical grazing pressure (Griffith et al. 2004).
The Chihuahuan Deserts and Playas ecoregion includes alluvial fans, internally drained basins, and river
valleys below 3,500 feet. The major Chihuahuan basins in Ecoregion 24a, such as the Hueco, Salt, and
Presidio basins, formed during the Basin and Range tectonism when the Earth’s crust stretched and fault
collapse resulted in sediment-filled basins. These low elevation areas represent the hottest and most arid
habitats in Texas, with less than 12 inches of precipitation per year. Precipitation amounts are highest in
July, August, and September, and winter precipitation is relatively sparse. The playas and basin floors
have saline or alkaline soils and areas of salt flats, dunes, and windblown sand. The typical desert shrubs
and grasses growing in these environments are creosotebush, tarbush, fourwing saltbush, blackbrush,
gyp grama, and alkali sacaton (Griffith et al. 2004, Brown 1994).
The Arid Llano Estacado ecoregion is generally similar to the remaining Llano Estacado, except that it is
drier. The Llano Estacado is large, flat, uplifted plain. The landform is dry, generally holding seasonally
available water in the form of ponds and playas. Vegetation is dominated by various grasses primarily
blue and side oats grama, buffalograss, and little blue stem. Yucca and various cacti are also present,
while cottonwoods maybe found in areas where the water table is high.

Geology
The portion of the project within in Winkler County traverses broad Quaternary (Holocene age) sand
deposits, as well as areas of evaporite/caliche deposits (Barnes 1983). The portion of the project in
Ector County is quite similar with Quaternary sand deposits and undivided Pleistocene surficial deposits
comprising the survey area (Barnes 1983).

Soils
Mapped soils within the project area in Winkler County are assigned to the Wickett-Sharvana complex,
Sharvana fine sandy loam, Blakeney-Conger complex, Pyote fine sandy loam, Toyah clay loam, and

5

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for Portions of the Proposed Shin Oak Pipeline Project
on University of Texas Lands

Kinco-Blakeney complex. These soils can be divided into two general types. The Wickett-sharvana
complex, the Sharvana fine sandy loam, Pyote fine sandy loam, and Kinco-Blakeney complex can be
characterized as having surficial horizons dominated by sand or sandy loam and at depth having a
horizon with moderate to high levels of calcium carbonate. While the Conger series and Toyah clay
loam are characterized by surficial horizons dominated by clay loams. At depth the Conger series horizon
is characterized by high levels of calcium carbonate, while the Toyah clay loam is not (NRCS 2018).
In Ector County mapped soils are assigned to the Jalmar-Penwell, Kinco-Ima, and Ratliff associations.
The Ratliff association generally consists of a loam, underlain by a series of clay loams formed within a
parent material of calcareous, loamy deposits. The Kinco-Ima association and the Penwell series all tend
to be fine sands or sand loams all of which have formed in parent material of eolian deposits. The Jalmar
series usually consists of a pair of fine sands underlain by a sandy clay loam again formed in a parent
material of eolian deposits. Calcium carbonate levels in these soils tend to be significantly lower than in
soils mapped in the project area in Winkler County.

CULTURAL SETTING
This portion of the report provides a cultural background for the APE. This cultural background is
presented to provide context and for use in interpreting any cultural resources encountered during the
cultural resources survey.

Prehistoric Background
The prehistoric portion of the historical record in the New World consists of the period between when
humans first entered the new world to the time of widespread European settlement and colonization of the
United States. The end of the prehistoric period may therefore changes from region to region.

Pre-Clovis Period
The timing of initial human occupation in the Americas has been the subject of numerous debates in
American archaeology. In simplified terms, the debate has been between so-called “Clovis First”
proponents, who maintained that Clovis represents the earliest culture in the Americas, and a “pre-Clovis”
faction that maintained that humans had resided in the Americas prior to the development of Clovis
culture. This issue has been debated since at least the middle of the twentieth century. Throughout the
debate, several sites, including Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania (Adovasio et al. 1983:163–189)
and the Shriver Site in Missouri (Regan and Evans 1976; Regan et al. 1978), have been put forth as early
human occupations based on an association with human-made artifacts. However, issues with these and
other sites have prevented their widespread acceptance.
Cracks in the Clovis First model became more visible in the 1980s and 1990s with the publication of
work from Monte Verde in Chile (Dillehay 1984; Quivira and Dillehay 1988) and the Big Eddy Site in
southwestern Missouri (Lopinot et al. 1998, 2000), among others. In the last two decades evidence from
both genetics (Gilbert et al. 2008; Tamm et al. 2007) and archaeology (Halligan et al. 2016; Jenkins et al.
2012; Waters et al. 2011) for pre-Clovis occupation has become overwhelming.
Little is known about the technology of these pre-Clovis peoples. Waters et al. (2011:1602) note that
“in general, the Buttermilk Creek Complex tools and cores are small and lightweight.” The tool kit is
described as containing “bifaces made through core reduction including end thinning, a lanceolate-like
preform, a discoidal core, bladelets, radially broken tools, a variety of edge-modified tools (notches,
gravers, and scrapers), and ground hematite” (Waters et al. 2011:1602). In addition, research at Paisley
6

on University of Texas Lands

Caves in Oregon indicates that Western Stemmed points were earlier than and contemporaneous with
Clovis and that the Western Stemmed Tradition constitutes “an indigenous development in the far
western United States” (Jenkins et al. 2012:227).

Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period covers the end of the Pleistocene and early part of the Holocene. An emerging
consensus places the cutoff between the two geological periods around 11,700 years ago (International
Commission on Stratigraphy 2017). One of the unique aspects of the period is the association with extinct
species that died off at the end of the last Ice Age. Horse, camel-like animals, mammoth, mastodon,
a large species of bison (e.g., Bison antiquus) have been found associated in early sites. Based on faunal
assemblages, the early Paleoindian period had more equitable climates with cool summers, mild winters,
and abundant precipitation (Johnson and Holliday 2004:285). Toward the end of the Paleoindian period,
the moist, mild summers and winters gradually became warmer and drier with increased aridity that had
noticeable changes in the flora and fauna (Quigg et al. 1993). With the changes in climate, the groups
adapted to these changes by increasing their reliance on small game and wild plant resources (Quigg et al.
1993; Johnson and Holliday 2004).
Early Paleoindian is typically defined as the Pleistocene-era patterns marked by the Clovis and Folsom
assemblages. The Late Paleoindian era is the Holocene cultures that gradually developed into Archaic
patterns. Besides these basic partitions, the Paleoindian period is generally further divided into subperiods
based on stylistic intervals and toolkits, often called techno-complexes, rather than social constructs as is
common in later parts of the cultural chronology. In part the convention stems from the relative lack of
substantial assemblages from the earliest inhabitants. Accordingly, the chronology of point styles forms
the basis that has gradually been fleshed out with other assemblage data.
These technocomplexes are: Clovis (11,500 to 11,000 B.P.), Folsom (10,800 to 10,300 B.P.), Plainview
(ca. 10,000 B.P.), and Firstview period (ca. 8,600 B.P.) (Bousman et al. 2004; Johnson and Holliday
2004). The Plainview and Firstview complexes are sometimes grouped under the Plano Period
(10,200 to 7,500 B.P.) along with Agate Basin, Hell Gap, Milnesand, Cody, and Frederick Complexes
(Hofman 1989; Quigg et al. 1993). The long-held notion of a clean sequence, particularly the
Clovis-Folsom-Plainview model, is currently viewed as overly simplistic.

Archaic Period
Although the project area is just east of the Pecos River the trajectory of the culture history closely
mirrors developments further west, as such the discussion of the Archaic is drawn primarily from
Miller and Kenmotsu (2004). The Archaic coincides with the spread of rugged Chihuahuan Desert scrub,
although the micro-environmental diversity ranged from alpine settings to barren flats.
Variously called the Chihuahua Archaic tradition, the Cochise tradition, or the Desert Archaic, the period
is an 8,000-year cultural trajectory of very gradually increasing population density coinciding with
increased social and technical complexity. Several chronological sequences have been developed for the
regional Archaic period, but different areas have variations in cultural developments that impose
difficulties in devising a unified scheme. Nevertheless, while acknowledging regional variation,
the Archaic from 9000 to 1000 B.P. is divided into Early, Middle, and Late Archaic subperiods.
MacNeish (1993) subdivides the Archaic into phases, including the Gardner Springs (8000 to 6300 B.P.),
Keystone (6300 to 4600 B.P.), Fresnal (4600 to 2900 B.P.), and Hueco (2900 to 2000 B.P.) phases. These
generally correlate with the tripartite division of Early, Middle, and Late Archaic: the Gardner Springs
phase correlates with the Early Archaic, Keystone phase with the Middle Archaic, and the final two are
divisions of the Late Archaic.

7

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for Portions of the Proposed Shin Oak Pipeline Project
on University of Texas Lands

The Early Archaic spanned roughly two to three millennia from 8000/9000 B.P. to 6000 B.P., although
there are different chronological schemes within the region. Miller and Kenmotsu (2004:220) begin the
period between 8000 and 8500 B.P., whereas MacNeish (1993) begins the period at 8,000 years ago,
while still other regional chronologies begin the Archaic by 9000 B.P. Researchers, however,
acknowledge the current lack of data to refine the sequence. Although the radiocarbon database from the
area is relatively robust, Miller and Kenmotsu (2004:220) note that from the Western Trans-Pecos only
11 dates fall within the Early Archaic, and of these 11, only a single date was clearly associated with
cultural materials. This paucity of dates indicates the lack of archaeological components attributable to
the period. Given these shortcomings, most of what is known of the period is a sequence of projectile
point styles, many of which are cross-dated from better known sequences in adjacent areas. Stemmed
points also found in the Lower Pecos and Central Texas, such as the Uvalde point, are diagnostic artifacts
of the period, as well as styles such as Jay and Bajada that are not found in adjacent areas of Texas.
Miller and Kenmotsu (2004:221) describe a change in raw material use patterns during the Early Archaic
in which coarser-grained materials are used for points, a distinctive shift from the use of only high quality
siliceous material in Paleoindian assemblages. Small hearths with burned rock or caliche indicate the
growing use of thermal-retaining elements.
The Middle Archaic from 6000 B.P. to 4000 B.P., is only slightly better represented in the archaeological
record, coincides with the peak of arid conditions and landform stabilization. Whereas Early Archaic sites
are often buried, Middle Archaic sites are frequently exposed on landform surfaces (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:223). During the period, indications of semi-permanent settlements begin to emerge. The Keystone
Dam site in El Paso County contains over 20 residential structures dating from approximately 4500 to
3800 B.P. (O’Laughlin 1980). Ashy areas probably represented interior hearths, and daub that was found
around the structures indicate a jacal-type superstructure. Although no clear evidence of agriculture has
been discovered, the increased presence of ground stone artifacts suggest an increased use of plant
resources. Although site distribution patterns of the period need substantial refinement, the advent of
semi-permanent settlements perhaps marks a shift toward a more intensive exploitation of localized
resources as the overall carrying capacity of the landscape declined during the hot, dry period. The
proliferation of projectile point styles during the period observed by some researchers indicate either
increased mobility or interaction (e.g., Mallouf 1985).
The Late Archaic from 4000 to 1000 B.P. marks the advent of new lifeways, a notable departure
from preceding patterns and a transition to full agricultural, sedentary societies in the subsequent
Late Prehistoric times. Beginning around 4500 B.P. but increasing dramatically shortly after 4000 B.P.,
the record shows an increase in radiocarbon data from rockshelters, structures, and open sites, reaching
maximum between 3200 B.P. and the onset of Puebloan times around 1000 B.P. (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:Figure 7.16, Figure 7.22). In some areas within the Trans-Pecos, the Late Archaic terminates earlier
than others. While in some areas Archaic hunter-gatherer traditions continued throughout the period,
in the El Paso and other areas in the western Trans-Pecos, the transition to sedentary agriculturalists
occurred over a long period, beginning in the preceding Middle Archaic as previously noted.
Accordingly, the end of the Archaic can be variously defined at around 2000 B.P. in some areas,
or 1000 B.P. in others. Radiocarbon data from the western Tran-Pecos reveal a dramatic increase in dates
from structures around 2000 B.P. (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:Figure 7.16), marking a fitting demarcation
between Archaic and Late Prehistoric patterns in that area.
The Late Archaic is divided into the Fresnal and Hueco phases. The Fresnal phase (4000 to 3200 B.P.,
a revision of MacNeish’s dates of 4600 to 2900 B.P.) is identified by an increase in the quantity and
stylistic variation of stone tools, larger occupational areas suggestive of longer occupations by larger
populations, and more intensive subsistence patterns, among other traits. MacNeish (1993) claims the rise
of horticulture or agriculture marks the start of the Fresnal phase, but a more recent compilation of direct
dates on cultigens contradicts this assertion. Miller and Kenmotsu (2004:Figure 7.16) show cultigens

8

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for Portions of the Proposed Shin Oak Pipeline Project
on University of Texas Lands

appear in the archaeological record just after 3000 B.P., but did not show up in substantial quantities
until 2200 to 1800 B.P., coinciding with the previously noted terminus for the Late Archaic in the western
Trans-Pecos. Projectile points diagnostic of the period include expanding stemmed, corner and sidenotched points ranging from small specimens resembling arrow points to larger broad-bladed styles
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:Figure 7.11). As this phase progressed, variation of point types and
technology increased, suggesting to some researchers expanded trade and contact with other groups.
In the Hueco phase from 3200 to 2000 B.P. (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:Figure 7.16), site distribution
patterns indicate populations spread into more diverse ecological settings, both moisture-rich and arid
areas (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:226). The Hueco phase coincides with a prominent increase in dated
components in both rockshelters and open areas (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:Figure 7.16). Dated cultigens
such as maize, beans, and squash occur during the phase, but the data does not support agricultural
dependence, or at least such an inference is equivocal (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:226-228). Not until
the succeeding Late Prehistoric, beginning roughly 2000 B.P. in the western Trans-Pecos, does a spike
in dated cultigens suggest a more substantive role of cultigens in subsistence. This spike corresponds
with the advent of pithouses. There is a marked increase in the amount of perishable goods that have
been uncovered by archaeologists from this phase, including basketry, twined and twilled matting,
sandals, gourd vessels, and even human hair (Lynn 1976:16). Lithic tools include projectile points
(Hueco, San Pedro, Hatch and Armijo points), drills, flake knives, core scrapers, manos and metates.
Expanding contact with other areas can be seen in the elaborate shell ornaments found from this period.

Formative Tradition (A.D. 500–1450)
“Formative” is a term commonly applied by archaeologists to the ceramic periods of the Jornada
Mogollon region (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:236–237). The well-dated sequence of sites in the
Hondo Valley, northwest of the region, suggests that ceramics appeared there around A.D. 500
(Campbell and Railey 2008), and this date is used here for the beginning of the Formative tradition.
The addition of ceramics to the inventory of artifacts provides a tremendous advantage in recognizing
Formative period site components as compared to pre-ceramic ones. Ceramics also enhance temporal
resolution and age estimates of site components, especially for the more distinctive, painted wares that
can cross-date between different regions. For this discussion, the Formative tradition is simply divided
into two periods: Early (ca. A.D. 500–1100) and Late Formative (ca. A.D. 1100–1450), with the
appearance of Chupadero Black-on-white being the most prominent marker separating the two.
Phase divisions within these periods can certainly be suggested based in part on the appearance of
certain key marker traits, such as early black-on-white ceramics toward the end of the Early Formative,
and a variety of distinctive glaze ware and polychromes after ca. A.D. 1300. But the development of
well-established phase sequences will depend on excavation data from more sites with securely dated,
single-component contexts. The early centuries of the Formative time frame witnessed little change in
subsistence and mobility from the Late Archaic. But significant changes did occur in the Late Formative
period, although for the general region some of the more important Late Formative developments are
inferred from surrounding regions, and further research will hopefully clarify the specifics of these in the
project region.
Two prominent changes in artifact assemblages mark the beginning of the Early Formative period.
One is the appearance of ceramics, which in the beginning consist of undecorated brown wares. These are
variously classified according to paste characteristics as Jornada Brown, McKenzie Brown, Middle Pecos
Micaceous Brown, South Pecos Brown, and Alma Plain (Hill 1996, 2000, 2001; Hogan 2006; Jelinek
1967; Katz and Katz 1985, 1993, 2001; Kelley 1984; Leslie 1979; Mera 1943; Reed et al. 2002:550–551;
Runyan and Hedrick 1987; Whalen 1981; Wilson 2000a, 2000b, 2003; Wiseman 1996, 2002), and which
persist well into Late Formative time frame. Early black-on-white ceramics (e.g., Cebolleta, Red Mesa,
Mimbres) appear in the region after ca. A.D. 750 (Katz and Katz 1993), but do not occur at all sites in the

9

on University of Texas Lands

later centuries of the Early Formative, and undecorated brown wares continue to dominate ceramic
assemblages throughout the period.
The introduction of the bow and arrow is inferred from a sharp reduction in the size of projectile points,
which occurs across most of sub-boreal North American around A.D. 500–600 (Bettinger and Eerkens
1999; Bettinger and Taylor 1974; Blitz 1988:130–132; Cordell 1979:134, 1997; Guernsey 1931:71–72,
99, 107; Huckell 1998; Justice 2002:44; Lipe 1978:369; Nassaney and Pyle 1999; Railey 2010; Seeman
1992; Shott 1993; Torres 2000:227; VanPool 2006:433; Yerkes and Pecora 1991). In the Southwest and
Southern Plains, the earliest arrow points are strongly shouldered, corner-notched or stemmed forms. At
the well-dated series of sites in the Hondo Valley of the Sierra Blanca highlands (Campbell and Railey
2008; Railey 2010), the earliest arrow points have shouldered, recurved blades similar to the Bonham and
Homan types in northeast Texas (Turner and Hester 1993:202, 219), and these are quickly followed by
straight-bladed points with tanged shoulders and corner notching. The latter forms, similar to the Scallorn
type of the Plains (Turner and Hester 1993:230) and the Trujillo and Dolores types in northern New
Mexico (Justice 2002; Turnbow 1997:202–205), persist throughout the remainder of the Early Formative
period and continue into the early portion of the Late Formative.
Except for the addition of ceramics and arrow points, Early Formative artifact assemblages remain similar
to those of the Late Archaic, with a variety of flaked stone tools and ground stone milling implements.
Other aspects of the Early Formative archaeological record also persist from Late Archaic times. There is
still a notable dearth of preserved house remains; the few dating from the Early Formative period in the
region come from just four sites (Jones et al. 2010; Railey 2011; Zamora 2000), and their characteristics
suggest rather expedient, wickiup-like brush huts set in shallow basins. The lack of evidence for
substantially constructed houses prior to the Late Formative suggests people across at least most of the
region did not invest heavily in residential architecture, and this is typical of highly mobile huntergatherers (Binford 1990; Kelly 1995:139–140).
Botanical remains of various wild plants, including cheno-ams, wild barley, and others are common
occurrences (e.g., Acklen and Railey 2001; Brown 2011; Condon et al. 2008; Lord and Reynolds 1985;
Railey 2011), along with succulents processed in burned-rock middens in the western portion of the
region (Jones et al. 2010). Unlike the Late Archaic, in the region there is one instance of charred maize
associated with a radiocarbon date for the Early Formative, at a site in the Guadalupe Mountains (Kemrer
1998). Otherwise, at present there is a complete lack of domesticates in macrobotanical assemblages in
securely dated, pre-Late Formative contexts, and this indicates that farming was not an important part of
the subsistence economy (or was not practiced at all) across most of the region during Early Formative
times.
The onset of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (A.D. 800/900–1350) reportedly ushered in a dry period
that heavily impacted people across much of western North America (Jones et al. 1999). The data suggest
that people responded to this drastic climatic change by withdrawing to areas where reliable sources of
surface water could still be found, which includes the Pecos River and, apparently, playas, areas below
escarpment edges (most notably along the base of the Mescalero Escarpment, where freshwater springs
probably continued to issue forth), and in the Mountain Slope area. In the latter area, most of the dates
are from burned-rock middens, so the numbers may also indicate an upswing in the use of these sites
and exploitation of low-rank, high-cost food resources processed at them (see Dering 1999). Although
precipitation levels apparently increased again toward the end of the Early Formative, the damage
apparently was already done, and the response to the period of severe drought may have helped prompt
some fundamental changes in cultural adaptations that took hold during the subsequent Late Formative
period.

The Late Formative period indeed witnessed some of the most profound changes in the prehistory
of the region. In terms of artifacts, the most prominent temporal indices of this period are a variety
of distinct and relatively well-dated decorated ceramic types. Chupadero Black-on-white and
El Paso painted (bichrome and early polychromes, and later just El Paso Polychrome) are present
by the beginning of this period, or soon after, eventually edge out undecorated brown wares, and persist
as common types throughout the Late Formative time frame (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:252–253;
Speth and Newlander 2012; Wilson 2000b). Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta is another distinctive type
that appears in the region around the beginning of the Late Formative period, but is less common than the
Chupadero and El Paso painted wares (Runyan and Hedrick 1987). Chupadero wares were manufactured
in the Sierra Blanca highlands (Clark 2006; Creel et al. 2002; Reed et al. 2002). Also from this region is
Corona Corrugated, a utilitarian ware that appears around or soon after A.D. 1200 (Kelley 1984;
Wiseman 2002). St. Johns Polychrome appears at about this same time (Miller 1995; Runyan and Hedrick
1987). After A.D. 1300, exotic ceramic types from a variety of areas in the Southwest appear in west
Texas and southeastern New Mexico, including Rio Grande glaze wares, Lincoln Black-on-red from the
Sierra Blanca highlands in New Mexico, Ramos Polychrome from the Casas Grandes area, and Gila
Polychrome from the Salado region (Katz and Katz 1993; Miller 1995). Another post-A.D. 1300 ceramic
type is Ochoa Indented, a Southern Plains type that appears to be restricted to areas east of the Pecos
River (Katz and Katz 1993).
Also occurring in the Late Formative period is a widely documented shift in arrow point morphology
during the thirteenth century. The earlier, corner-notched arrow point styles with strong shoulders are
replaced by side-notched arrow points with wide, squared, or concave bases. These late forms are usually
referred to as Harrell, Desert Side-notched, Washita, or Pueblo Side-notched (Justice 2002; Speth 2004;
Turnbow 1997; Turner and Hester 1993). Un-notched triangular points are rare in the Southwest, but do
occur in the Plains (and are especially common in eastern North America) and spill over in small numbers
into the project vicinity. In Texas these are usually referred to as Fresno points, and their reported time
span (ca. A.D. 800–1700) is not as restricted as those for the other arrow point types discussed above.
There is evidence to suggest that these un-notched triangular points are actually preforms that were
intended to be finished and notched, and they were widely transported as they were less fragile and
susceptible to breakage than finished points (cf. Chesier and Kelly 2006; Dawe 1987; Newlander and
Speth 2009).
By A.D. 1300, if not earlier, substantially occupied “villages” were established across much of the larger
region. This was part of widespread pattern of greater sedentism and village formation across the southern
Great Plains and Jornada Mogollon region in the early to mid-second millennium A.D. (Brooks 2004;
Campbell 1976; Drass 1998; Drass and Flynn 1990; Jelinek 1967; Kalasz et al. 1999:195–198; Kelley
1984; Lintz 1984, 1986, 1991; Lutes 1959; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Speth 2004, 2005; Speth and
Newlander 2012; Wendorf 1960; Wiseman 1981, 1985, 2002; Zamora and Oakes 2000). Most of what
we know about Late Formative “village” sites in the region comes from excavations carried out decades
ago, using pre-modern methods. A cluster of villages were occupied in the project vicinity at the Andrews
Lake site, several of which have been excavated (Collins 1966, 1968). Jennings (1940) excavations at
Rio Peñasco and two neighboring sites provide a glimpse of Late Formative village life in the Mountain
Slope area. Decades ago the Lea County Archaeological Society (LCAS) excavated several village sites,
including Boot Hill (Corley and Leslie 1960) and Laguna Plata (LCAS 1971). Eastern New Mexico
University’s subsequent excavations at Laguna Plata (Haskell 1977) and TRC’s recent investigations at
Laguna Plata (Brown 2010) and Boot Hill (Brown 2011) added additional information about these two
important sites. In addition, as part of the BLM CFO Permian Basin Mitigation Program in New Mexico,
recent investigations were carried out at the Maroon Cliffs, a sprawling site complex west of the project
area that includes substantial remains of Late Formation occupations (Stowe and Condon 2012). Surveylevel investigations have also documented sites with intensive Late Formative occupations in the
Mescalero Plain and Escarpment Base areas. These include Indian Hill (LA 32228, also known as

11

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for Portions of the Proposed Shin Oak Pipeline Project
on University of Texas Lands

Taylor Peak), where a burial, a pit house, and charred maize were found (Hunt 1989), and a sprawling site
complex in the vicinity of the Merchant site (Lone Mountain Archaeological Services [LMAS] 2001).
Late Formative village sites tend to occur in areas where springs, precipitation runoff, or playa lakes
offered reliable sources of surface water, and at least limited riparian environments and associated
resources. The base of the Mescalero Escarpment was an especially favored zone for these sites.
As far as detailed information pertaining to the role of maize in Late Formative subsistence economies of
west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, the closest comparative evidence we have to date comes from
two settlements west of Roswell, New Mexico: Henderson and Bloom Mound (Kelley 1984; Powell
2001; Speth 2004, 2005). For these sites, the evidence
points to farming as a modest contributor to the diet throughout, with little or no indication of significant
intensification in the later part of the sequence (e.g., small numbers of recovered maize remains; ubiquity
and abundance of wild seeds; carbon isotope values indicating modest overall intake of C4 plants;
low incidence of [dental] caries; small numbers of metates, mostly basin-shaped; and wholly
unstandardized one- and two-handed manos). (Speth and LeDuc 2007:46)
Another important subsistence trend that inhabitants of these Late Formative villages were caught
up in was an increased emphasis on bison hunting across the region and elsewhere in the southern
Plains after ca. A.D. 1250, following a regional hiatus in bison hunting that began in A.D. 500
(Baugh 1986; Bozell 1995; Brooks 2004; Collins 1968, 1971; Creel 1991; Dillehay 1974; Drass and
Flynn 1990; Greer 1976; Hughes 1989; Jelinek 1967; Speth 1979, 1983, 1984, 2004; Speth and Parry
1978, 1980; Spielmann 1991; Staley 1996). At some point during the Formative time frame, people
on the Plains began killing bison beyond what was required for their own subsistence and other resource
needs, and traded hides, dried meat, and perhaps other products to the more settled farmers to the west
(Creel 1991; Speth 2004, 2005; Speth and Newlander 2012; Spielmann 1991). Creel (1991) argues that
this regional exchange system was underway around or soon after A.D. 1300, with the key archaeological
indicators being the appearance in the southern Plains of numerous beveled knives and endscrapers that
were used to process bison hides.
As for far west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, at present we have mostly indirect evidence as to
the role of Late Formative peoples in the Pueblo-Plains interaction sphere. Creel (1991:41) reports that
this exchange system extended all the way down to present-day Chihuahua. Occasional bison remains
also appear in Late Formative sites in the western Jornada Mogollon (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:250),
and it seems likely that bison hides (which would not show up in the faunal record) were probably traded
to the people of the El Paso phase (A.D. 1250/1300–1450). Late Formative villagers in west Texas and far
southeastern New Mexico would have been well positioned as the most likely suppliers of bison products
to the western Jornada Mogollon and settled groups further to the south. But it still remains an open
question whether, and if so to what extent, Late Formative villagers developed an export economy fueled
by bison products. Further research is needed to elucidate the details pertaining to this question.

Post-Formative (A.D. 1450–1500)
The Post-Formative begins with the widespread abandonment of late prehistoric villages in the southern
Plains around A.D. 1450, as groups throughout the region shifted to a more nomadic lifeway centered
more squarely on bison hunting (Baugh 1986; Bozell 1995; Brooks 2004; Collins 1968, 1971; Creel
1991; Dillehay 1974; Drass and Flynn 1990; Greer 1976; Hughes 1989; Jelinek 1967; Speth 1979, 1983,
1984, 2004; Speth and Parry 1978, 1980; Spielmann 1991). Archaeologically, this period is somewhat of
a phantom, as many of the diagnostic ceramic types largely disappeared along with village sites. Ceramics
are either absent in the region at this time or, to the extent they were still in use, consist of types that are
largely unknown (Katz and Katz 1993). Side-notched arrow points, similar to those that appeared after

12

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for Portions of the Proposed Shin Oak Pipeline Project
on University of Texas Lands

A.D. 1200 (see above), continued into this period until an unknown date and were eventually replaced by
metal arrow points and firearms.
As part of the shift to nomadism during post-Formative times, it is reasonable to expect that tipis
became a more common dwelling form. Seymour (2002, 2004; LMAS 2001) has identified tipi rings in
both the western Jornada Mogollon and far southeastern New Mexico. She argues that tipi rings in the
region are very late in time, postdating other types of structures, and even concludes that at least some
are late nineteenth century Apache or Comanche dwellings. Such conclusions lack supporting evidence,
however (see Kenmotsu et al. 2009:96–97). Tipi rings date back several thousand years on the Plains,
and it is entirely possible that at least some tipi rings in the project vicinity predate the post-Formative
time frame.
By A.D. 1500, if not earlier, people on the southern Plains had given up their attempts at village life,
with its mixed focus on farming and bison hunting, and had become nomadic, tipi-dwelling bison hunters.
This probably occurred at least in part due to increased demand from the pueblos for bison products and
other resources from the southern Plains (such as Alibates and Edwards chert). One intriguing trend that
may characterize post-Formative occupations in the region of project area is the increased use of obsidian,
most of which appears to derive from sources in northern Chihuahua and southwestern New Mexico
(Kenmotsu et al. 2009:92). This apparent trend was also noted in the Middle Pecos River valley
(northwest of the region) by Jelinek (1967). Within the project region, however, Jemez Mountain
obsidians are also found in apparent protohistoric contexts, although the source of these could actually
be Rio Grande gravels in the western Jornada Mogollon region (Stein 2011).

Historic Chronology
The Historic period began with the first Spanish expeditions through the region in the sixteenth through
eighteenth centuries. In 1582–1583, Antonio de Espejo led an expedition to the upper reaches of the
Rio Grande and Pecos River before returning southward along the latter (Bolton 1908:189–190; Snow
1992:235–236).
In 1589 to 1590, Gaspar de Sosa, the lieutenant-governor of Nuevo Leon, led a large, but unauthorized,
colonizing party through west Texas, evidently following the Pecos River (Chipman 1992:58).
For violating settlement policies, a viceregal agent captured and returned de Sosa to Mexico. After being
convicted, he was exiled to the Philippines where he died in a slave revolt.
In 1683, Dominguez de Mendoza, with a mandate to look for pearls, trade possibilities, and instilling
respect for friars among the native people, led a group of soldiers from La Junta to the Pecos River
(Chipman 1992:70), probably following Espejo’s route. After arriving at the Pecos River, the expedition
traveled “downstream for nine leagues to a point near Horsehead Crossing” (Chipman 1992:70), where
they turned eastward.
In 1787, Juan de Ugalde led an extensive expedition through the region in an effort to subdue the
Apache threat. Ugalde’s expedition was part of a new Spanish policy for securing the northern frontier.
The Spaniards threatened military force, but also offered the Apaches protection from the Comanche as
an inducement for peace. The Comanche, however, as well as Apache groups, dominated the area well
into the late nineteenth century.

WINKLER AND ECTOR COUNTIES
As with other counties in west Texas, American Anglo occupation didn’t begin in the areas of
Winkler and Ector counties until the 1880s. Initially, economic pursuits were centered around agricultural

13

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for Portions of the Proposed Shin Oak Pipeline Project
on University of Texas Lands

products however, ranching particularly of cattle soon took precedence in the region. Since, the late
1920’s oil and gas production has assumed economic primacy in the area.

BACKGROUND REVIEW AND SURVEY METHODS
Background Review
SWCA conducted a thorough cultural resources background review and literature search of the project
area and surrounding 2-mile-wide study area (1 mile on either side of the pipeline centerline).
On September 6, 2017, SWCA Project Manager Amanda Cohen examined relevant portions of the
THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas). These sources provided information on the nature and
location of previously conducted cultural resources surveys, previously recorded historic and/or
prehistoric archaeological sites, NRHP districts and properties, SALs, Official Texas Historical Markers,
Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys within or near the
APE. Additionally, SWCA examined the Texas Department of Transportation Texas Historic Overlay
Maps, a mapping/GIS database with historical maps and resource information covering most portions of
the state (Foster et al. 2006).
A review of the THC’s Atlas indicated that four previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted
within 1 mile of the APE (Table 1, Figure 4 and Figure 5). The review also indicates that 2 previously
recorded archaeological sites are within a 1-mile buffer of the project area (Table 2). Site 41WK20 was
originally recorded during the survey for the All American Pipeline. The site is a small lithic scatter that
has been determined ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP by the SHPO. Site 41WK49 is a hearth-field
consisting of six FCR concentrations; the site lacks diagnostic artifacts. This site has also been
determined ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP by the SHPO.

Cultural Resources Survey Methods
SWCA’s investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey of the APE located on lands managed
by the University of Texas. The survey was of sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and,
if possible, significance of cultural resources discovered within the APE. The survey complied with
applicable standards as defined in 13 Texas Administrative Code 26.20 and met all THC minimum
archaeological survey standards for such projects with all exceptions thoroughly documented.
The intensive pedestrian field survey consisted of SWCA archaeologists walking the existing easement
utilizing transects spaced no more than 100 feet (30 m) apart, which equals three (3) parallel transects
across the 300-foot-wide survey corridor. Portions of the project area are collocated with an existing
subsurface gas pipeline. In such cases, pedestrian survey was restricted to the project area outside the
portion of previous disturbance.
Council of Texas Archeologists standards indicate a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on individual
survey transect; however, SWCA observed that the surface-visibility percentage was high enough
throughout portions of this APE that less intensive shovel testing was applied. Similarly, in areas where
the survey corridor was collocated with existing pipelines, those previously disturbed areas were not
shovel tested. Shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm arbitrary levels to a 1-m depth unless soil conditions
or bedrock preclude reaching that depth. All matrix was screened through ¼-inch mesh for artifact
recovery. SWCA plotted each shovel test using a sub-meter accurate global positioning system (GPS)
receiver, and recorded each test on appropriate project field forms in tablets to expedite recoding during
survey investigations.
When archaeological sites were encountered in the APE during the investigation, they were explored
as much as possible with consideration to the boundaries of the APE. All discovered sites were assessed
regarding their potential significance so that recommendations can be made for proper management
(i.e., avoidance, non-avoidance, or further work). Shovel tests were excavated per THC standards to
define horizontal and vertical site boundaries. SWCA completed appropriate State of Texas
Archaeological Site Data Forms for each site discovered during the investigations. SWCA produced
a detailed plan map of each site and plotted locations on USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles
and relevant project maps. SWCA conducted a non-collection survey; artifacts, including temporal
diagnostics, were tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the field, but not collected to reduce curation
costs; however, as per the terms of the Antiquities Permit, all paperwork and photographs generated
during the survey will be curated at an approved curatorial facility.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY RESULTS
On October 24, 25, and 29, 2017, two SWCA archaeologists conducted a 100 percent intensive cultural
resources survey of the 300-foot-wide survey corridor centered on approximately 5.13 miles of proposed
pipeline alignment centerline that crosses public lands (Appendix A). The intensive cultural resources
16

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for Portions of the Proposed Shin Oak Pipeline Project
on University of Texas Lands

investigations examined a total of 194.2 acres within the survey corridor. The general setting of the
APE is rural and isolated with no residential areas and extensive industrial development within the
surrounding oil and gas fields on public lands. Disturbances across the APE vary in extent and severity.
The most prominent disturbance is the oil and gas development associated with petroleum exploration
and expansion, which includes well pads; crude oil, hydrogen sulfide, and holding tanks; surface and
buried pipelines; and other disturbances, including overhead and buried utilities and transmission line
corridors with associated vegetation clearing, earth moving, and gravel access roads.
Surface investigations involved carefully examining the ground surface throughout the APE looking
for cultural materials. Subsurface investigations involved the excavation of 202 shovel tests during the
course of the survey to delineate sites (Appendix B). Although investigations involved three transects
within the 300-foot survey corridor, field conditions—such as exposed bedrock, broad deflated areas,
and existing disturbances (i.e., previously cleared pipeline corridor)—limited where shovel testing
occurred. Shovel testing typically terminated at compact soil, although several shovel tests revealed deep
sand to 100 cm below surface (cmbs). The results are summarized below and presented by county.

Texas and are located Northwest of the town of Wink, Texas, toward the western end of the project
(see Appendix A). The background review and literature search indicated that no previously recorded
archaeological sites or surveys are within a mile of the APE.
The pipeline travels across 4.07 miles in Winkler County, and the survey area encompassed
approximately 155.6 acres. For most of this portion of the pipeline it is collocated with the existing
pipeline ROW. Generally only two transects of shovel tests were excavated, outside the area of previous
disturbance. Vegetation is dominated by grasses but mesquite is also present. A total of 148 shovel tests
were excavated throughout the survey area in Winkler County (see Appendix B). Primary anthropogenic
disturbances within the parcels include the previous construction from existing oil and gas field
infrastructure (e.g., access roads and pipelines). Natural disturbances include wind erosion/scouring.
A single historic-aged archaeological site was encountered.

SITE DESCRIPTION
The site is a historic artifact scatter measuring 119 × 32 m (390.42 × 104.99 feet) covering an area of
1,791.80 m2 at an elevation of 2777 feet amsl (Figure 7). The site is situated just east of Monument Draw
on a dissected upland. The landform slopes down to the north where an incised drainage runs westward
to enter Monument Draw (Figure 8 ). On-site vegetation is dominated by mesquite and creosote. On-site
soils are sandy and eolian in origin.
The site is in generally poor condition and is estimated to be 30 percent intact (Figure 8 and Figure 9).
Artifacts have likely been displaced laterally by erosion. Surface visibility is generally good;
approximately 75 percent.

Features
No features were encountered.

Materials Identified
The artifact assemblage is typical of historic sites that date to the mid-1900’s in west Texas.
The assemblage is dominate by bottle glass and includes colorless, brown, green, blue, and milk glass.
Closure types include screw and crown cap. The assemblage also includes crushed indeterminate can
fragments, cone top beverage cans, miscellaneous metal, and stone ware ceramics. The stone ware
appears to be some type of large sewer/drainage pipe. The artifact assemblage totals between
300 and 500 individual artifacts.

Subsurface Investigations
A series of six shovel tests were excavated on site. All six shovel tests failed to recover subsurface
cultural materials. The shovel tests revealed a single stratigraphic unit extending from the surface to
approximately 35 cmbs; the stratum was a 7.5YR8/2 (pinkish white) sand. Excavation was terminated at
bedrock.

Site Chronology and Interpretation
Most of the material on-site is non-diagnostic in nature; however, the cone-top beverage cans
(Figure ) tend to date from between 1935–1966 (Rock 1989). Additionally, a bottle base with an OwensIllinois maker’s mark (Figure ) was encountered; this style of maker’s mark dates to approximately 1929–
1965 (Lockhart et al. 2018). A complete bottle with the word “Fitch” embossed
in cursive on the bottom, was also observed (Figure 4). This most likely, was a hair-care product by
F.W. Fitch dating to between 1905 and 1955 (Fike 1986). The site most likely represents a single- or
several-episode historic trash dump. The artifacts are not in their locations of use and it is unlikely that
site will reveal information related to specific behavioral patterns.

Eligibility and Management Recommendations
The site is not known to be associated with a locally or regionally significant event or individual
and is therefore not eligible for the NRHP under Criteria A and B. The site does not illustrate a particular
architectural style or represent the work of a master and is therefore not eligible under Criterion C.
The presence of buried cultural deposits is not anticipated, based on the examination of the erosional cuts

22

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for Portions of the Proposed Shin Oak Pipeline Project

and several shovel tests. Therefore, the site is unlikely to yield further information that will refine our
understanding of past lifeways in this region. SWCA recommends the site not eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP under Criterion D.
The site is recommended not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under any criteria or for listing as a SAL.
No further work is recommended.

PARCEL 0023.000.00.00-EC-TX
Parcel 0023.000.00.00-EC-TX is managed by the University of Texas and is located approximately
2 miles south of Penwell, Texas in Ector County (see Appendix A). The background review and literature
search indicated that no previously recorded sites or cultural resource surveys are within one mile of the
APE in parcel 0023.000.00.00-EC-TX.
The survey area within parcel 0023.000.00.00-EC-TX extends 1.06 miles and encompasses 38.6 acres.
Vegetation across the parcel consisted of mesquite, yucca, grasses and creosote. The thin scrub brush and
shallow bedrock provided ground surface visibility of 50 to 100 percent (Figure 10). The primary
disturbances within the parcel include extensive oil and infrastructure development (e.g., access roads and
pipelines). Natural disturbances include wind erosion/scouring. A total of 55 shovel tests were excavated
on this parcel. A single historic archaeological site was recorded within the parcel.

SITE DESCRIPTION
Site 41EC31 is a small, historic artifact scatter measuring 72.6 m × 13.8 m (238.19 feet × 45.28 ft)
covering an area of 818.53 m2 at an elevation of 2,876 feet amsl (Figure). The site is situated on a
relatively flat plain just south of a gravel road and east of a two-track. Vegetation is dominated by
mesquite and includes grasses and forbs (Figure 4–Figure 16). On-site soils are sandy in nature and eolian
in origin. The site is in generally poor condition, estimated to be about 30 percent intact.
In addition to the gravel road and two-track anthropogenic disturbances are evident in additional gas and
oil infrastructure. Surface visibility is good, approximately 60 percent, and is occasionally obscured by
grasses.

Features
No features were identified.

Materials Identified
The artifact assemblage is typical of historic sites that date to the mid-1900s in west Texas.
The assemblage is dominated by bottle glass and includes colorless and brown examples. The assemblage
also includes miscellaneous metal, rubber, concrete, and painted white ware ceramics. The artifact
assemblage totals between 100 and 150 individual artifacts.

Subsurface Investigations
A series of six shovel tests were excavated on site. All six shovel tests failed to recover subsurface
cultural materials. The shovel tests revealed a single stratigraphic unit extending from the surface to
approximately 50 cmbs; the stratum was a 7.5YR4/4 brown loamy sand. Excavation was terminated
due to soil compaction.

Site Chronology and Interpretation
Most of the artifacts on-site are non-diagnostic. However, a brown glass, Clorox bottle (Figure ) was
encountered. Since Clorox had completely shifted to plastic bottles by 1962 (The Clorox Company 2018),
the bottle must pre-date this. The site most likely reflects a single or perhaps several depositional events
of historic refuse. Most of the material is domestic in nature, although there are some structural elements
(i.e., concrete). The site’s location within a developing oil and gas field, just along a gravel road, is an
ideal location for such refuse deposition.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On October 24, 25, and 29, 2017, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources survey on portions
of the proposed Orla to High Plains Pipeline project that cross University of Texas land in Winkler and
Ector Counties, Texas. The APE includes a 300-foot-wide environmental survey corridor that would
traversed approximately 5.13 miles of University of Texas land. Impacts associated with the proposed
construction will occur within a 50-foot-wide pipeline construction corridor, 30 feet of which will be
permanent ROW. Subsurface impacts are anticipated to extend 5 to 6 feet below the existing ground
surface for the pipeline.
Prior to fieldwork, SWCA’s investigations included a cultural resources background review and literature
search. A review of the THC’s Atlas indicated that four previous cultural resources surveys have been

27

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey for Portions of the Proposed Shin Oak Pipeline Project
on University of Texas Lands

conducted within 1 mile of the APE. Only one of the four previously surveyed project areas is adjacent
to (within 300 feet of) the APE, a geoseismic survey conducted by LMAS in 2017. The review also
indicates that 2 previously recorded archaeological sites are within a 1 mile buffer of the APE. These sites
are 41WK20 and 41WK49 both sites are relatively small, prehistoric sites that have been determined
ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP by the SHPO.
As a result of the recent survey effort, SWCA excavated 202 shovel tests and recorded two newly
identified historic archaeological sites (41WK117 and 41EC31). Both sites are historic in age and
represent a single or a few short-term depositional events of historic refuse. Assemblages are
characterized by domestic artifacts in particular various types of bottle glass, ceramics, and cans;
although 41EC31 has some structural debris as well. Based on the nature of these sites as historic artifact
scatters, the lack of unique character and lack of contextual integrity (i.e., surface site only), as well as the
limited behavioral information potentially available, these resources possess negligible research value and
are unlikely to contribute to the understanding of local and/or regional history. Consequently, SWCA
recommends that site 41WK117 and 41EC31 are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for SAL
designation, and no additional work is recommended for these sites.
In accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and Section 106, 36 CFR 800.4 of the National Historic
Preservation Act, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify archaeological sites
and historic properties within the investigated APE. Based on the negative shovel test results and the
negligible research value of the sites, the planned project will have no adverse effect on cultural
resources. Therefore, no additional archaeological investigations are recommended on these lands
managed by the University of Texas, and the project may proceed.
