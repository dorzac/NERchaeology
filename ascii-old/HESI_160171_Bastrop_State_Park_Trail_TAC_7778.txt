ABSTRACT

On 21 September 2016, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed Bastrop State Park Trail Project located on
the east side of Bastrop in Bastrop County, Texas (Project Area). The City of Bastrop is
proposing the construction of approximately 1.0 miles (1.6 kilometers) of pedestrian/bicycle trail
to connect Bastrop State Park to existing sidewalks along Chestnut Street near downtown
Bastrop. The proposed trail would extend along the south side of State Highway (SH) 21 within
existing roadway easements. As the undertaking would be located on public property, it would
fall under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, the proposed trail
would traverse a tributary of Gills Branch. This crossing may require the use of a Nationwide
Permit (NWP) issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As NWPs are federal
permits, the portion of the undertaking under the purview of the USACE would also fall under
the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. At the request of the City of Bastrop, Horizon conducted the cultural resources
survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The
purpose of the survey was to determine if any significant archeological deposits are located
within the Project Area and, if any exist, to determine if the project has the potential to have any
adverse effects on sites eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or
sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit no. 7778.
As the Project Area extends along the southern edge of SH 21, the cultural resources
survey resulted in the observation that the vast majority of the Project Area has been previously
impacted by highway and infrastructure construction, utility installation, and various other forms
of modern development. Despite this, the survey resulted in the documentation of 1 newly
recorded historic-era archeological site. Site 41BP950 was documented as a historic-era debris
scatter dating to the mid-20th century. Based on the lack of aboveground architecture and the
sparsity of the remaining cultural materials, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41BP950 is ineligible
for formal designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the NRHP. No additional investigations are
recommended on this site in connection with the current undertaking.
Based on the assessment that site 41BP950 does not warrant formal designation as an
SAL or inclusion in the NRHP, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the Bastrop State

Park Trail Project will pose no adverse effects to significant cultural resources that are eligible
for formal designation as SALs or that are listed on or considered eligible for listing on the
NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed to proceed relative to
the jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely
event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the Project
Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the
proposed Bastrop State Park Trail Project located on the east side of Bastrop in Bastrop
County, Texas (Project Area) (Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The City of Bastrop is proposing the
construction of approximately 1.0 miles (1.6 kilometers) of pedestrian/bicycle trail to connect
Bastrop State Park to existing sidewalks along Chestnut Street near downtown Bastrop. The
proposed trail would extend along the south side of State Highway (SH) 21 within existing
roadway easements. As the undertaking would be located on public property, it would fall under
the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, the proposed trail would
traverse a tributary of Gills Branch. This crossing may require the use of a Nationwide Permit
(NWP) issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). As NWPs are federal permits, the
portion of the undertaking under the purview of the USACE would also fall under the regulations
of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. At the
request of the City of Bastrop, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the
cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT and Section 106 of the
NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any significant archeological deposits are
located within the Project Area and, if any exist, to determine if the project has the potential to
have any adverse effects on sites eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs) or sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP). The cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit no. 7778.
The Project Area consists of a proposed concrete sidewalk that would connect an
existing sidewalk near downtown Bastrop to the entrance of Bastrop State Park. This sidewalk
totals approximately 1.0 miles (1.6 kilometers [km]) in length and approximately 10.0 feet
(3.0 meters [m]) in width (1.2 acres). The anticipated depth of impacts would be less than
12.0 inches (30.5 centimeters [cm]) below surface.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
K. Brownlow (Horizon’s Cultural Resources Director) served as the project’s Principal

Investigator, while Briana Smith (Horizon staff archeologist) and Samuel Brigham-McLellan
(archeological field technician) conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 21 September 2016. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts along the length of Project
Area. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the Project Area totaled 1.0 miles (1.2 km) in length, a minimum of 16 shovel tests
were necessary in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 29 shovel tests within the Project Area.
As the Project Area extends along the southern edge of SH 21, the cultural resources
survey resulted in the observation that the vast majority of the Project Area has been previously
impacted by highway and infrastructure construction, utility installation, and various other forms
of modern development. Despite this, the survey resulted in the documentation of 1 newly
recorded historic-era archeological site. Site 41BP950 was documented as a historic-era debris
scatter dating to the mid-20th century. Based on the lack of aboveground architecture and the
sparsity of the remaining materials, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41BP950 is ineligible for
formal designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the NRHP. No additional investigations are
recommended on this site in connection with the current undertaking.
Based on the assessment that site 41BP950 is considered to be ineligible for formal
designation as a SAL or for inclusion on the NRHP, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development
of Bastrop State Park Trail Project would pose no adverse effects on significant cultural
resources that are eligible for formal designation as SALs or that are listed on or considered
eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed
to proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location
of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area is located on the east side of Bastrop, extending along the southern
side of SH 21 between downtown Bastrop and the entrance of Bastrop State Park. It can be
found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) Bastrop, Texas, 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle
(see Figure 1-1). The Project Area consists of a concrete sidewalk that extends approximately
1.0 miles (1.6 km) in length and approximately 10.0 feet (3.0 m) in width (1.2 acres). The
anticipated depth of impacts would be less than 12.0 inches (30.5 cm) below surface.
The western end of the Project Area initiates at an existing sidewalk just to the east of
downtown Bastrop (Figure 2-1). As can be seen in Figure 2-1, the area along the southern side
of SH 21 consists of an elevated, artificial berm that is several feet above natural grade.
Progressing eastward, the Project Area passes in front of a modern house before reaching the
intersection of SH 21 and SH 95 (Figures 2-2 and 2-3). After crossing over SH 95, the Project
Area continues atop an artificial berm, passing in front of a modern convenience store (Figure 24). From there, it continues eastward toward a tributary of Gills Branch within an area that was
once the roadbed of SH 21 between 1899 and 1950 (Figures 2-5 and 2-6; see discussion of the
prior SH 21 alignment in Chapter 4.0). Once the Project Area reaches the tributary of Gills
Branch, it extends along an artificial berm that covers culverts used by SH 21 to span the
tributary (Figure 2-7). On the east side of the tributary of Gills Branch, the Project Area enters a
forested hillside. Within this area, the Project Area follows an existing overhead transmission
line and an underground utility line (Figure 2-8). As the Project Area extends uphill toward the
intersection of SH 21 and SH 150, it enters an area that has experienced considerable prior
disturbances from roadway construction and utility installation (Figure 2-9). After crossing over
SH 150, the Project Area terminates at the entrance to Bastrop State Park (Figure 2-10).
As can be seen in Figures 2-1 through 2-10, the entire length of the Project Area is
situated within existing, previously disturbed roadway, utility, and drainage easements that
retain little to no potential for containing intact cultural deposits.

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is situated in an area of undulating hills that are dissected by Gills
Branch and its tributaries on the eastern edge of the City of Bastrop. Elevations within the
Project Area range between approximately 370.0 and 530.0 feet (112.8 and 161.6 m) above
mean sea level. Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Colorado River Basin.
The Project Area is drained to the southwest by a tributary of Gills Branch. This tributary joins
Gills Branch roughly 500.0 feet (152.4 m) southwest of the Project Area. Gills Branch flows to
the southwest, joining the Colorado River approximately 0.9 miles (1.4 km) southwest of the
Project Area.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Bastrop County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate
is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas
manifest regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east
to west and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast
(Larkin and Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to
subtropical subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81.3 centimeters (32.0 inches) and
temperature averages 19°Celsius (C) (67°Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in

HJN 160171 AR

11

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

August (the warmest month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time,
however, drier periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30.5 to
63.5 centimeters (12.0 to 25.0 inches), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114.3 to
127.0 centimeters (45.0 to 50.0 inches) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall.
Two extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 centimeters (36.0 inches) of rain that fell within
an 18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 55.9-centimeter
(22.0-inch) deluge that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower
rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so
frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from
west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture
is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely
penetrate into the region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943).
Some species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The
boundary, characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian
provinces passes through western Williamson County, northwest of the APE. Rainfall in the
Texan province is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified as a C2 (moist
subhumid) climate with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica),
and hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this
soil type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas
include the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies. Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County, as well as a series of peat
and bog marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum

(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern
cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis), ground squirrel (Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana),
hispid pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), blacktailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), 9-banded armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), and jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the
Austroriparian province—eastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)—
occur in the Texan.
Sixteen species of lizards, including 7 grassland and 9 forest species, are also found,
including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis)
(grassland species), as well as collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard
(Sceloporus olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink
(Eumeces obsoletus) (forest species). Only 5 species of urodele fauna are known from this
area, including small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander
(Ambystoma tigrinum), and eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts
as a barrier to urodele distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west
and the Austroriparian fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the
Texan into the Austroriparian province include Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Strecker’s
chorus frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include 6-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis
sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough
green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback
rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water
snake (Nerodia rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis).
Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).
Although small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and
early historic periods, these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:1314).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The APE is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological Region.
The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North
America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the
Buttermilk Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis
culture may have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al.
2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late
PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas occurred in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay;
however, de Vaca did not approach the Colorado River basin or the Bastrop region. It was not
until 1691, when Domingo Terán de los Ríos led an expedition along the route that became
known as the Camino Real, that exploration of this region began.
In the late 17th century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began
migrating into Central Texas to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines and
missions and on Spanish ranches. At approximately the same time, horses stolen from the
Spanish had become an integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison
hunters of the High Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies.
They terrorized native groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing
many to flee, some into Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the
region encountered native groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids
of the Apache, and the diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. Their
accounts, therefore, do not provide direct analogues to prehistoric cultural patterns, but rather
represent a time of drastic cultural change (Collins 1995). A few indigenous cultural patterns
may have prevailed through time. Large, diffuse encampments composed of peoples with
mixed ethnic affiliations and small, band-sized residential camps date to this particular period in
Central Texas (Collins 1995:386). The smaller sites may represent indigenous groups.
Historical documents dating from the 1730s to 1800 make reference to remnants of
native groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins 1995). Toward the end of
this timeframe, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern Texas from the high plains.
Records of their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be highly biased since they were
provided mostly from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers (Collins 1995).
During the early part of the 19th century, the Native American presence in Central Texas
was composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung nomadic native groups (primarily
the Comanche)” (Collins 1995:387), with EuroAmerican settlers becoming increasingly
common. The Comanche presence began fading in the mid- to late 19th century. Their final
expulsion heralded the end of Native American presence in Central Texas.
In 1804, a Spanish fort was built on the Old San Antonio Road Colorado River crossing.
The self-proclaimed Baron of Bastrop, a German immigrant who had been given permission by
the Mexican government to settle near this crossing, established the settlement of Bastrop in
1823. Further attempts to settle the area failed until a new settlement was established by
Stephen F. Austin in 1827. Many well known Texas pioneers first settled in the Bastrop area.
One of these early settlers, James Burleson, owned a parcel of land that would become a
portion of Buescher State Park. The population of the Bastrop settlement at the time of the
Texas Revolution was around 400 individuals.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

The railroad came to Bastrop in the early 1870s and helped establish logging as the
major local economic activity. Iron, coal, and manufacturing became important industries by the
late 19th century. By 1900, the population of Bastrop County had increased to 26,845, up from
around 7,000 at the start of the Civil War.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of 29 previously recorded archeological sites,
2 cemeteries, 129 historic properties listed on the NRHP, and 2 address-restricted NRHP
districts within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (THC 2016), while a review of the
National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of the
same NRHP properties within the review perimeter (NPS 2016). These documented cultural
resources and their distances from the Project Area are summarized in Table 4-1, while their
locations relative to the Project Area are presented in Figure 4-1.
While there are numerous documented cultural resources within the review area, only
one, Bastrop State Park, is located in immediate proximity to the current Project Area at the
eastern terminus of the Project Area. The entirety of Bastrop State Park is a listed NRHP
district and a National Historic Landmark (NHL). This NRHP district/NHL is composed of
numerous park facilities that were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s
as well as numerous archeological sites. As the undertaking is proposed to provide a
pedestrian/bicycle trail between downtown Bastrop and this state park, only the extreme eastern
end of the Project Area connects to the entrance of this NRHP district/NHL. As the Project Area
terminates at the park entrance, none of the features composing the NRHP district/NHL would
be impacted by the current undertaking.

4.2

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have been
conducted within the boundaries of the current Project Area.

4.3

MAP REVIEW

A review of historic aerial imagery containing the Project Area found that the available
imagery dates only as far back as 1995. This imagery showed little change along the route of
the Project Area aside from the construction of the convenience store at the southeast corner of
the intersection SH 21 and SH 95.

While the aerial imagery was available for only the past few decades, topographic
quadrangle maps were available for the years between 1885 and 1986. These maps show that
the current alignment of SH 21 is present from 1950 until the present. Prior to 1950, the 1899
through 1944 topographic quadrangles show that the alignment of SH 21 was shifted slightly to
the south on the west side of the tributary of Gills Branch (Figure 4-2). This suggests that
roughly the western half of the current Project Area is located within the prior alignment of the
roadbed. This is also supported in part by the unnatural, linear topography visible to the west of
the tributary of Gills Branch on the later topographic quadrangles (Figure 4-3).

4.4

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

The Project Area extends along the southern edge of the modern alignment of SH 21.
This area has experienced considerable impacts in the past from roadway construction, bridge
construction, and utility installation. Moreover, archival research has shown that a portion of the
Project Area is also located within the former alignment of SH 21 that was utilized between 1899
and 1950 (see Figures 2-6, 4-2, and 4-3). With this in mind, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed a relatively low potential for any deeply buried and intact cultural
deposits that could be eligible for formal designation as SALs or for inclusion in the NRHP within
the Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew conducted the survey of the Project Area on
21 September 2016. This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing
efforts along the length of the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests
per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the Project Area
totals 1.0 miles (1.2 km) in length, a minimum of 16 shovel tests was necessary in order to
comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 29 shovel
tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited
successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, and
cultural materials observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were completed for every
shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts
encountered. If any new archeological sites were recorded, standard site forms were to be
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, if any previously recorded archeological sites were assessed, updated site
forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or
for return to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and
assessed in the field and placed back where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo
log were completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via
handheld global positioning system (GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator
(UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test
locations are presented in Figure 5-1. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS

As anticipated, Horizon’s survey of the Project Area found that it extends along a route
that has been previously impacted by prior highway and infrastructure construction, utility
installation, and various other forms of modern development that have left little to no potential
for intact cultural deposits. Despite this, the survey resulted in the documentation of 1 newly
recorded historic-era archeological site. This site, 41BP950, is discussed below.

6.1

41BP950
General Description

Site 41BP950 is a newly recorded archeological site that was documented as a lowdensity scatter of mid-20th century domestic debris (Figures 6-1 and 6-2). It is located on the
crest of a ridge immediately south of SH 120 and approximately 365.9 m (1,200.0 feet) east of
an unnamed tributary of Gills Branch. It is located on the eastern side of an existing driveway
that leads to a modern residence a short distance to the southwest of the site. The area
containing the site has been heavily disturbed by the construction of SH 21 as well as power
and water lines. Vegetation consists of dense ragweed, greenbrier, prickly pear cacti, mature
pine trees, and various grasses and weeds (Figures 6-3 and 6-4). A total of 7 shovel tests were
excavated on this site. Of these, only 1 produced cultural materials from subsurface contexts.
As noted above, site 41BP950 is located a short distance to the northeast of a house
structure that is visible on the most recent (1982) topographic quadrangle, which may suggest
that it could be associated with this residence (see Figure 6-1). However, this structure is not
present on the 1972 topographic quadrangle. Rather, 2 structures are shown just south of the
location of site 41BP950 on the 1972 and 1948 topographic quadrangle maps, suggesting that
the observed cultural debris is likely associated with these earlier occupations, both of which
appear to have been removed at some point during the modern development of the area
(Figure 6-5).
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41BP950 consist entirely of domestic refuse (Figures
6-6 and 6-7). Observed materials include clear and opaque glass shards, whiteware ceramic
sherds, metal pull-tab cans, a screw-top bottle with a "Duraglass" makers mark embossed on

the base and an unidentified symbol embossed on the body consisting of the letter "Z" attached
to the top of the number 3.
While a reference for the marker consisting of the attached “Z” and “3” could not be
found, the specimen with the embossed “Duraglass” logo points to a mid-20th century utilization
of site 41BP950. Duraglass is a process used by the Owens-Corning Glass Company to
produce scratch-resistant bottles by spraying stannic chloride vapor on heated bottle bodies.
This process and the embossed logo began in the 1940s and continued until the mid-1950s
(SHA 2016).
Cultural Features
No evidence of any intact cultural features was observed on the surface of the site or
within any of the 7 excavated shovel tests.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed cultural materials, the assessed horizontal extent of
the site measures approximately 77.4 m (254.0 feet) east to west by 15.2 m (50.0 feet) north to
south.
Based on the subsurface shovel testing efforts, the vertical extent of the site ranges
between 0.0 and 20.0 cm (0.0 and 7.9 inches) below surface.
Summary
Site 41BP950 was documented as a mid-20th century debris scatter that is likely
associated with 1 or 2 residences that once stood just south of this location. The first use of the
site is evidenced by 2 house structures on the 1948 topographic map. Both structures are still
present on the 1972 topographic quadrangle, but they appear to have been removed by 1982,
likely during the construction of the overhead powerline that spans this location. The recovery
of a bottle on the site possessing a “Duraglass” makers mark, typically dating to the late 1940s
to 1950s, supports the assessed mid-20th century utilization of the site.
Based on the lack of aboveground architecture and the sparseness of the remaining
debris, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41BP950 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criteria C and D. Additional archival research would be necessary to evaluate its potential
association with events or persons of historic importance under Criteria A and B of the NRHP.
However, as 20th-century homesteads are a common site type, such sites must retain
substantial integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association
in order to establish significance under the NHPA. Given the sparsity of materials on the site
and the absence of standing structures, it is unlikely that any possible association with persons
or events of historic importance would be sufficient to establish significance under Criteria A
or B of the NRHP. Thus, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41BP950 is ineligible for inclusion in the
NRHP or for formal designation as an SAL, and that no further investigations are warranted on
this site in connection with the proposed undertaking.

BASTROP STATE PARK

The eastern end of the Project Area terminates at the entrance of Bastrop State Park, a
listed NRHP district and NHL. As the Project Area does not extend into the park, the
undertaking poses no adverse effects to any subsurface cultural deposits or aboveground
features associated with this NRHP district/NHL.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

On 21 September 2016, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the
proposed Bastrop State Park Trail Project located on the east side of Bastrop in Bastrop
County, Texas. The City of Bastrop is proposing the construction of approximately 1.0 miles
(1.6 km) of pedestrian/bicycle trail to connect Bastrop State Park to existing sidewalks along
Chestnut Street near downtown Bastrop. The proposed trail would extend along the south side
of SH 21 within existing roadway easements. As the undertaking is located on public property,
it would fall under the regulations of the ACT. In addition, the proposed trail would traverse a
tributary of Gills Branch. This crossing may require the use of a NWP issued by the USACE.
As NWPs are federal permits, the portion of the undertaking under the purview of the USACE
would also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended. At the
request of City of Bastrop, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area
in compliance with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any significant archeological deposits are located within the Project Area and, if any
exist, to determine if the project has the potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible
for formal designation as SALs or listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. The
cultural resources investigations were conducted under TAC permit no. 7778.
The survey of the Project Area entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing efforts within the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel
tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the Project
Area totaled 1.0 miles (1.6 km) in length, a minimum of 16 shovel tests was necessary in order
to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 29 shovel
tests along the length of the Project Area.
As the Project Area extends along the southern edge of SH 21, the cultural resources
survey resulted in the observation that the vast majority of the Project Area has been previously
impacted by highway and infrastructure construction, utility installation, and various other forms
of modern development. Despite this, the survey resulted in the documentation of 1 newly
recorded historic-era archeological site. Site 41BP950 was documented as a historic-era debris
scatter dating to the mid-20th century. Based on the lack of aboveground architecture and the
sparsity of the remaining materials, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41BP950 is ineligible for

HJN 160171 AR

45

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

formal designation as an SAL or for inclusion in the NRHP. No additional investigations are
recommended on this site in connection with the current undertaking.

7.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the assessment that site 41BP950 does not warrant formal designation as an
SAL or inclusion in the NRHP, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of Bastrop State Park
Trail Project will pose no adverse effects on significant cultural resources that are eligible for
formal designation as SALs or that are listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP.
Horizon therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed to proceed relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely
event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the Project
Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
