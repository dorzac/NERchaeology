INTRODUCTION
This report summarizes the results of specified
archeological assessments carried out in areas proposed
by the U.S. Army Engineer District, Fort Worth, for land
modifications to be made in connection with the Three
Rivers Flood Protection Project, Live Oak County, Texas.
This project includes the construction of an earthfill
levee to partly encircle the municipality of Three
Rivers.

This plan would also require fill removal from

designated barrow areas situated outside of the levee
construction.
The study herein reported is the fourth in a series
of investigations carried out by the Texas Archeological
Survey in the Three Rivers Project area.

.

This multi­

phase field investigation was made necessary by the
development of alternative engineering designs for levee
placement, the designation of barrow areas, and the need
for subsurface testing at certain of the archeological
sites discovered in the initial surficial reconnaissance.
To date they have included the following:
1975

A literature search and field surface survey
of areas proposed for modification by the then
developed engineering design.

A total of nine

prehistoric sites were discovered; six of these
localities were determined to be in positions
,

where they would be detrimentally affected by

project construction.

Recommendations were

made for subsurface testing at certain of these
identified sites and testing of one locality,
a'hillock near the planned southeastern terminus
of the levee (see Mallouf 1975).
1977

An alternative levee design, differing sub­
stantially from the initially authorized place­
ment in the northwestern quadrant of the project
area, necessitated additional surface survey.
This planned alignment, proposed to be placed
well east of the Frio River channel, was examined
and found to conflict with archeological sites
41 LK 113, LK 114, LK 57 (reported in the first
survey) and LK 116.

Recommendations to test

sites LK 113, LK 114 and LK 57 were offered;
site LK 116 was deemed to contain sufficient
archeological potential to justify mitigative
action prior to project construction (see
Mal10uf 1977).
1977

A separate testing operation was completed by
the Texas Archeological Survey at the three sites
(41 LK 113, LK 114 and LK 57) recommended by the
previous survey.

For various reasons related to

evidence of post-depositional disturbance of the
archeological residues, no recommendations for
further work at sites LK 113 and LK 57 were

•

offered.

Subsurface testing at Site 41 LK 114,

however, indicated that important archeological
information might be derived from controlled
sampling.

This locality, situated on a hillock

at the proposed northern levee terminus, was
assessed as meeting eligibility requirements
for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places (see Prewitt and Scott 1977).
The field investigation reported here was confined to
the following:
1.)

A survey of two proposed barrow areas situated

outside of the flood levee structure in the southern
arm of the project (see Figure 1),

For purposes of

discussion these are designated Barrow Areas "A"
and "B",

The area of a third barrow source, located

in the northern portion of the project, had been
inspected in an earlier phase of the work (Mallouf
1977),
2.)

A more intensive examination of an elevated

area near the southern terminus of the flood levee.
This area was noted and recommended for subsurface
testing in the 1975 survey (Mallouf 1975).

At the

time of this initial inspection the surface of this
hillock was obscured by thick vegetation.

Its elevated

position and nearness to Oids Slough suggested a high
probabilit~

for aboriginal occupation.

A characterization of the natural environment of the
area and a discussion of the regional archeological back­
ground has been provided in the report of the initial
project survey (Mallouf 1975).
SURVEY PROCEDURES
The field work for this phase of the project assess­
ment'was carried out on March 29 and 30 and April 10, 1979.
The survey crew consisted of Duford W. Skelton, H.G.
Wooldridge and David S. Dibble of the Texas Archeological
Survey staff.

Barrow Area A, located in the southwestern

portion of the project and the largest area to be inspected
(approximately 225 acres in extent), was walked in five
north-south oriented transects.

Except for a narrow zone

of dense riparian vegetation bordering the channel of the

•

Frio River, the area was characterized by excellent surface
visibility_

Virtually all of it had been under recent row­

crop cultivation and had been modified by deep plowing.
Currently this area is the property of the Sigmor Refining
Company and an extensive evaporating pond is under construction
in the northwestern portion of the designated barrow source
area.

Surface scraping and dike formation has extensively

modified or obscured the ground surface in this vicinity.
In summary, except for a restricted zone bordering the Frio
River, Barrow Area A has been heavily affected by recent
I

agricultural and industrial activities

Barrow Area B, a much smaller area in the southeastern
portion of the proposed levee alignment, was examined in a
similar fashion.

Although a substantial portion of the area

had been covered during the survey of the levee corridor,
three walking transects were made to insure reasonable
surface coverage.

Extensive surface modification from

agricultural use is again characteristic of this property.
Examination of the small hillock crossed by the levee
alignment at a point near the southern terminus was not
satisfactorily assessed.

Because of the property owner's

objection to extensive subsurface testing the original
intent of widely dispersed, deep subsurface probing was not
accomplished.

However, intensive surface inspection of

this landform combined with shovel tests to maximum depths
of 0.5 meters did demonstrate that significant prehistoric
and historic material is present.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS
Three archeological sites were recognized during this
phase of the survey.

They are identified here by tunomial

designators applied by the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin.
Site Summaries
Barrow Area A
41 LK 229
Description:

Site is situated in previously cultivated

field bordering the heavily vegetated flood plain of the

.

6

Frio River.

The visible southern boundary of the site is

approximately 150 meters north of the present river channel.
The surface is characterized by a scatter of mussel shell,
chert and Guartzite flakes and angular fragments of fire­
affected stone of various types.
Visibility of this cultural debris was improved by recent
plowing.

The lithic and shell scatter was generally light

over the observable extent of the site but was characterized
by limited areas of relatively high concentration.

The associ­

ated surface sediment was a fine silty or fine sandy loam,
grading to a clay loam lower horizon.
Three shovel tests dug in the southern, central and northern
portions of the site area suggested that the cultural debris
was limited to the plow zone.

These exposures were made to
~

depths of about .75 m.
Area of Site:

The surficially visible debris extends

about 200 m. CN-S) x ISO m. (E-W).
Collections:

None.

One basal fragment of biface and

several cores observed.
Evaluation:

The identified cultural debris has been

reworked by deep plowing.

Although the present ground surface

is relatively flat, it appears that previous irregularities
have been leveled by long term row crop agriculture.

A

"smearing" effect on the original horizontal position of the
cultural material has probably occurred.
features or sub

~low

No intact structural

zone occurrences of archeological material

was observed.
No further work is recommended.

41 LK 230
Description:

Site is situated in recently cultivated

field on the crest and sides of a slightly elevated rise
(approx. 1 m. above surrounding ground surface).

The nearest

site boundary is about 300 m. east of the Frio River channel.
Archeological surface indications include dispersed mussel
shell fragments, angular fragments of fire-affected stone and
very limited quantities of flaked chert and other siliceous rock
types.

Small "chunks" of fire-hardened clay were also associ­

ated with this scatter.
Surface visibility was good due to recent plowing.

The

eastern portion of the site area is currently being affected by
heavy machinery scraping--this

activ~ty

associated with con­

struction of an evaporation pond by the Sigmor Refining Company.
Shovel tests into the fine sandy loam sediments failed to
find evidence of cultural material below the plow zone.

Two

small excavations were made to depths of .75 m.
Area of Site:
Collections:
Evaluation:

125 m.

eN-S) x 7S m. (E-W).

None
Cultural material appears to be dispersed

and restricted to the plow zone.

The. site structural integrity,

like Site 41 LK 229, has been severely affected by past land
use.
No further work is recommended.

Barrow Area B
No archeological sites or features were observed.
Southern Terminus - Hillock
As noted previously, investigations in this survey phase

. i

were to have included substantial subsurface examinations of
a small land rise crossed by the proposed levee near its
southern terminus.

Although permission to carry out testing

of this magnitude was not obtained, intensive surface examina­
tion combined with small shovel tests did conclusively demon­
strate that this landform is associated with a broadly expressed
concentration of prehistoric and historic debris.

41 LK 228
Description:

Prehistoric cultural material (mussel shell,

fire-altered rock fragments, chunks of burned clay, moderate
quantities of chert flakes and other siliceous rock types and
some bone fragments) distributed over the top and south flank
of hillock overlooking the channel of Olds Slough.

Some of

these materials extend for a few meters on the terrace surface
to the east of the knoll.

A few concentrations of burned

rock fragments may represent relatively intact fire hearths.
Some artifacts of historic age, earthenware and glass sherds
and pieces of metal are present on the crest of the knoll. No
historic structural features were observed.
Past modifications of the site area include artificial
terraces and old plow scars on the lower flanks of the rise.
Rodent disturbance is present but considered relatively

A petroleum pipe line crosses the eastern portion

of the site.
Shovel tests excavated

to depths of 0.5 - 1.0 m. sug­

gested that prehistoric cultural debris was present--possibly
in stable stratigraphic context.

Observed sediment

on the

hillock is a sandy loam extending to a depth of at least I m.
Area of Site:
Collections:

250 m. (N-S) x 125 m. CE-W).
One complete projectile point was collected.

The artifact is shallowly side-notched and has a convex base.
The specimen is reminiscent of Ensor type varieties associated
elsewhere with the late Archaic period.
historic sherds was made.

A sampling of

Observed prehistoric materials in­

cluded dart point fragments, other bifacially flaked tools,
unifacially modified flakes and cores.
Evaluation:

Although subsurface testing of the location

was extensive, the present evidence indicated considerable
depth to prehistoric residues present.

A degree of structural/

stratigraphic integrity is suggested by the presence of
hearth-like features on the site and by the relatively slight
degree of historic land modification.

The association of a

side-notched dart point (Ensor type) would imply a late Archaic
age for at least part of the occupation.
The historic residues present are limited to broken
artifacts; no structural remnants of this period were observed.
The site does appear, on the basis of this inspection, to
have the potential for yielding significant archeological data.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The current phase of cultural resource assessment in
areas to be affected by construction of the proposed Three
Rivers Flood Protection Project resulted in the discovery
and evaluation of three sites.

Prior surveys and test exca­

vations reported to the U.S. Army Engineer District, Fort
Worth (Mallouf 1975, 1977; Prewitt and Scott 1977) succeeded
in the identification of 12 sites endangered to various degrees
by various land modifications (including alternate levee
alignments, a short re-channelization of the Frio River and
barrow source areas for levee construction.

Although residual

historical features and sites were observed during the survey,
they did not provide evidence of being potentially significant
resources.

All formally designated sites represent prehistoric

or possibly late historic aboriginal occupation of the area.
Examinations of Barrow Area A indicated the presence of
two extensive surface scatters of cultural material (sites 41
LK 229 and 41 LK 230) which have been very adversely affected
by past agricultural land use.

In our opinion, further archeo­

logical investigation at these locations is not justifiable.
Survey in Barrow Area B in the southeastern portion of the
project area was broadened beyond that carried out by the
initial investigation (Mallouf 1975) with negative results.
Intensive surface examination and shovel testing of the
elevated location near the southern levee terminus demonstrated
the presence of extensive prehistoric cultural material on
\

1

11

and around this topographic feature.

The observation of rela­

tively intact features, apparently fire hearth remains, plus
the occurrence of subsurface cultural material in the upper
sand unit of the hillock is considered to be sufficient to
conclude that this site may have significant archeological
potential.
A review of all phases of cultural resource assessment
completed in the Three Rivers project area leads to th.e con­
clusion that most of the' identified archeological sites have
been seriously damaged by historic land use.

Our coverage is

sufficientlY extensive to demonstrate that the area is charac­
terized by extensive scatters of occupational debris known
to be typical of Archaic and Late Prehistoric localities known
from the region.

In the majority of cases, and due to the

generally unfavorable post-depositional environments, investi­
gations beyond the survey level would not be fruitful.
Under the assumption that the alternate levee alignment
situated farthest from the Frio River channel is selected,
three prehistoric sites are considered to warrant serious
consideration prior to the construction of the Three Rivers
Flood Projecttion Project.

They are the following:

Site 41 LK 114
An open site located on a sandy knoll at the northern
terminus of the flood levee.

This site was initially reported

by Mallouf (1977) and tested substantially by Prewitt and
Scott (1977).

The results of the testing phase lead to the

"

~
r'

12

conclusion that the site warrants a program of controlled
sampling prior to construction of the flood levee (see Prewitt
and Scott 1977 for discussion).
Site 41 LK 116
An open site with prehistoric and historic residues
located near the juncture of the alternate levee alignments
in the central portion of ot the project.

Assessments expres­

sed by Mallouf (1977) include a recommendation for controlled
sampling

a~

this location prior to project construction.

Site 41 LK 228
Assessments carried out under terms of the present
research phase are described herein.

The evidence observed

indicates that this site may have potential for contributing
to our understanding of regional prehistory.

It is clear that recommendation for avoidance of these
sites by this proposed construction or provisions for imple­
menting a reasonable program of data recovery at these endan­
gered sites prior to construction are in order.
Assuming at this time that avoidance of these ·locations
by the levee constructions would pose serious engineering
problems, it is recommended that a pre-construction sampling
program sufficient to sample any subsurface expression of
sites 41 LK 114, 41 LK 116 and 41 LK 228 be carried out.
The geological circumstances in the Three Rivers area
appear to be favorable for the burial of archeological traces

"

13

situated near the borders of the present Frio River channel.
For this reason it is quite possible that barrow removal
l

acti vi ties associated with proj ect construction might expose
cultural materials which have escaped detection by our surveys.
Constructors engaged in fill.removal should thus be alerted
to this possibility and to the urgency of reporting any sus­
pected archeological material to the proper regulatory
authorities.
