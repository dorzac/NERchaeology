ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The excavation and study covered in this report, and the report itself, could not have been done
without the hands-on involvement of, and direct support by, the members of the Houston
Archeological Society (HAS). Their dedication and concern are greatly appreciated. Many of
them devoted numerous hours to the actual excavations, and those residing in Wharton housed
many of the volunteers who worked at the site. Indeed, several members donated money for
the production of a report: Thomas Abell, Alec Abell, Eve Bartlett, as well as the Women's
Service League of Wharton, Texas.
Special thanks goes to that "local member" of the HAS referred to in the first paragraph of this
report, Joe Hudgins. His awareness and knowledge led directly to the investigations of this
site. He has helped with the analysis and reporting by checking questionable points and
gathering further information where necessary. Throughout all this, his interest has been apparent and his encouragement readily available and freely given.
We thank those student and faculty archeologists from several Texas universities and the
archeologists employed by the Texas Historical Commission; all of them willingly provided
their expertise and devoted many hours of their weekends to the excavations.
My personal thanks to Ann Magennis, who stood beside me while I began the analysis and
provided instruction, references, and resources to carry me through; to Jack Jackson, who remembered seed beads from another cemetery site and started me on the trail of Lithospermum;
to Dr. Kenneth Jacobs, then of the Department of Anthropology, The University of Texas at
Austin, under whose academic supervision I did the initial analysis; and to Dr. Jerome Rose,
University of Arkansas, who read the first report and offered constructive comments for the
second. Recognition is due to Grant Hall for his fine investigation and reporting of the Allens
Creek project; his generous information sharing for this report has been greatly appreciated.
Thanks, too, to Dr. Thomas Hester, Director of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
for his assistance and encouragement, to Carolyn Spock for general editing and configuring the
report, and to Jerry Henderson for reviewing and commenting on the final version.
Finally, my unlimited gratitude to Dr. Dee Ann Story, former Director of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, instructor, typist, editor, reference finder, critic, and friend.
Without her encouragement and support, I would have been overwhelmed-more than once.

INTRODUCTION
On February 1, 1981, a utility company crew using a mechanical trencher in a new subdivision
in the southeastern Texas town of Wharton unearthed some human bones and artifacts. The
workmen notified a local member of the Houston Archeological Society (HAS) who, after inspecting the bones, reported the find to the Texas Historical Commission. Subsequently, students and faculty volunteers from The University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin), The University of Texas at San Antonio, and Texas A & M University joined members of the HAS in
testing and excavating this small prehistoric cemetery, designated 41 WH39 and named the
Crestmont site (Fig. 1). Margaret Kluge, then a graduate student at UT-Austin, supervised the
fieldwork. Between February 1981 and the spring of 1982, skeletal remains representing 31
individuals and their associated grave goods were excavated and brought to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at UT-Austin for preliminary processing. The human
bones were not completely processed and studied until the fall of 1981 when, as a graduate
student in anthropology at UT-Austin, the writer undertook their analysis as a course research
project. This paper is an outgrowth of that project.
The skeletal remains, and a few associated offerings found during cleaning of the bones, are
still at T ARL. The balance of the collection-most of the artifacts, all of the field notes, photographs of the burials in situ, and the artifact inventories--are in private hands and were not
available to the writer. For that reason this study is based on the skeletal remains, laboratory
photographs of the artifacts recognized in the field (many were photographed before they had
been washed and restored), the few specimens discovered in the laboratory while cleaning the
skeletal material (see Appendix A), and a copy of Kluge's site map. Statements on burial position and orientation are based solely on this map. Figure 2 is a redrawn reduced copy.
Because of the limitations imposed by these circumstances, this is not a full archeological report on the Crestmont site. It is restricted to general aspects of the burial practices, skeletal
pathologies, and demographic analysis. The primary purposes are (1) to gain as much anthropological and archeological information as possible from the osteological remains uncovered
and (2) to describe these burials in a manner that will facilitate future comparative studies. In
addition, an attempt is made to determine the cultural-historical framework of the burials.
Among the anthropologically useful characteristics that are observable in cemeteries are the location of the grave within the cemetery, the arrangement of the skeleton in the grave, and the
offerings associated with the burial. Without these kinds of information, a cemetery analysis is
incomplete. A cemetery study suffers when demographic and pathologic analyses are not carried out as far as possible. As is shown below, these data sets can vary and can characterize
groups just as material goods do. The importance of these data prompted the present study.

Site Setting and Investigations
The Crestmont site is located in the city of Wharton in the central part of Texas' Gulf Coast
Plain. The burials lay in a low, northwest-southeast trending rise, south of a former channel of
Caney Creek and northeast of the present course of the Colorado River. The rise appears to
represent a fossil (Holocene) floodplain feature, probably a point bar or levee, deposited when
the Colorado River ran farther to the east in a channel later occupied by Caney Creek
(McGowen et al. 1976:15; Bureau of Economic Geology 1974). Although the deposit containing the burials cannot be closely dated, the shallowness of the burials suggests that the
levee largely, if not entirely, predates the cemetery. The prior existence of the rise is compatible with the obvious linear (north-south) layout of the excavated part of the cemetery (Fig. 2).

INTRODUCTION

I 3

Although it is not possible to detail the methods used to excavate the site, several pertinent observations can be made. First, all but the northern limits of the cemetery appear to have been
established. How much farther to the north the site extended, or, more important, what percentage of the cemetery has been excavated, cannot be determined accurately. The number of
burials recovered nonetheless makes this one of the larger prehistoric cemeteries reported to
date in the area (Aten et al. 1976:55-79; Hall 1981:Table II-19), and a statistically significant
sample for analysis.
Primarily on the basis of information provided by persons who assisted in the excavation of the
site, it is evident that there was little habitation debris recovered. What was found appears to
postdate most, perhaps all, of the burials. The site survey form on file at TARL further indicates that faunal remains comprised much of this apparent, occupational debris. Ceramics are
noted as being present, but how many, what kind, and what context are unknown.

Archeological Background
The Crestmont site lies in the upper reaches of the Texas central coastal archeological region.
The prehistory of this region is not as well known as other parts of Texas. Much of the work
in the area was done in the 1930s and documentation is sketchy. Consequently, comparisons
have been made with better known but distant regions, such as central and east Texas, or with
specific cultural units (e.g., Aransas, Rockport, and Morhiss foci) whose chronology and spatial ranges are not satisfactorily defined. In the past 20 years or so, the area has received more
in-depth attention from both professional and avocational archeologists, adding substantially to
the record (Hall 1981; Hudgins and Kindall 1984). Results of these and other investigations
are being synthesized (Hall, in prep.).
A close cultural affiliation between the people of Crestmont and those of one site in the Allens
Creek complex was obvious from the beginning of excavations. Therefore, the conclusions
from Allens Creek investigations (Hall 1981:267-309) are the appropriate background for this
report.
The Crestmont site lies about 40 km (25 miles) south of the Allens Creek area. Grant Hall,
who was a volunteer worker at Crestmont, has noted (1983) that it shares many characteristics
with the large Late Archaic cemetery (Group 2) at the Ernest Witte site (41AU36), one of four
stratigraphically distinct burial groups (Groups 1-4) uncovered at this remarkable site. Subsequent study and comparisons of the available records and materials from the Crestmont site
support Hall's interpretation. Group 2 burials are estimated to date between 520 B.C. and
A.D. 440, based on radiocarbon dates obtained from human bone and comparisons with other
relevant cultures. The Crestmont site is then considered of approximately the same time period.
The Allens Creek investigations found evidence of human activity from the Middle Archaic
through the Late Prehistoric periods. Thirty-three prehistoric sites were located during a 1972
survey for the Houston Lighting and Power Company: six along the banks of Allens Creek, a
tributary of the Brazos River, and 27 along the bluff overlooking the Brazos floodplain. No
Paleo-Indian or Early Archaic period sites were recognized. Middle and Late Archaic sites were
found along erosional gullies cutting the bluff; Late Prehistoric sites were found both in the
gullies and along steep-faced parts of the bluff. Three sites, Ernest Witte (41AU36), Leonard
K (41AU37), and Little Bethlehem (41AU38), were investigated intensively in 1974. At
41AU36, located in an erosional gully, the Group 1 burials produced human bones which were
dated at 2610 B.C. Â± 140 (Tx-2453; Hall 1981:49) and 1530 B.C. Â± 90 (Tx-2127; Hall
1981:49) The above dates are corrected for half life of 5730 after Damon, Long, and Wallick
(1972). These burials postdated an initial period of limi~ed habitation. A radiocarbon date

4 /THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
(corrected as above) of A.D. 1480 Â± 80 (Tx-2126; Hall 1981:103) on carbon collected from the
highest zone at the related Leonard K site, 41 AU37, indicates that prehistoric occupation in the
area continued to at least A.D. 1400 (Hall 1981:103). Faunal remains--fish, fowl, and mammals-suggest that the primary food resources were obtained from the streamside lowlands;
the secondary area of exploitation was the adjacent uplands. Grinding-slab fragments evidence
plant-food processing during the Middle and Late Archaic. No seasonality studies of the food
remains were done; it was assumed that habitation was seasonal, but repeated, over a 4500year period. The consistent selection of the same location suggests some ecologically specific
living requirements and, by inference, a generally stable subsistence base. In the four periods
represented at the Witte site, it appears that only during Transitional Archaic times (ca. A.D.
550-950) was habitation the primary use of the site. The main site function was a burial
ground before and after this period.
Sixty-one burials are attributed to the Ernest Witte Middle Archaic Group 1 cemetery. As noted
above, there is evidence of habitation at the site before any interments, but of only brief habitation concurrent with the Group 1 burials. About 96 percent of the burials were extended and
on the back. Orientation of the head could be determined for 31 burials; in 61 percent of these
cases the head pointed south-southeast, and about 23 percent, east-southeast. Grave goods,
found with only 12 percent of the burials, were most commonly long, rounded, bone splinters
with tapered ends. A Pedemales dart point was included with one. Marcos, Lange, Travis,
Wells, and Ensor points were also associated with this group of burials.
The Late Archaic Group 2 cemetery comprised at least 145 burials probably interred between
500 B.C. and A.D. 400. It is believed, but not proven, that the site was not inhabited but was
used only as a burial ground during this time. Forty-two percent of the burials were extended
and on the back. Predominant orientation of the head (about 46 percent) was to the northnortheast, followed by about 28 percent to the east-northeast. Grave goods were far more
frequent (48 percent) and varied than in Group 1 burials; many offerings were of materials
from distant sources.
Grave inclusions were placed with seventy (48%) of the Group 2 individuals at
41AU36 and also with Burial 2 at 41AU37. The grave goods included marine shell ornaments, worked bone objects, boatstones, comer-tang knives, a ground stone gorget,
ocher, biotite schist, deer skulls and antlers, projectile points, a graphite schist abrader,
and red jasper pebbles. These artifacts were placed in the graves of both males and
females of all ages. The single recognizably meaningful pattern of grave inclusions
relative to age or sex was the restriction of worked bone objects to individuals over
twenty years of age. Five individuals in Burial Group 1 [sic: Group 2] apparently died
as a result of wounds inflicted by projectile points. Fairland and Kent dart points and
three untyped expanded stem dart points were embedded in the bones of these five individuals.
The following major differences are noted between Burial Groups 1 and 2 at 41 AU 36:
1. the predominant headward orientation changes from southeast in Group 1 to
northeast in Group 2
2. the arrangement of bodies with a hand to the face or with legs crossed at the
ankles occurs only in Group 2
3. the number and variety of grave inclusions increased greatly in Group 2
4. the burial population more than doubles from Group 1 to Group 2. (Hall 1981:
273)
The nine Transitional Archaic Group 3 burials are tentatively dated to about A.D. 550-950. A
few ceramic sherds and moderate amounts of animal bone, mussel shell, burned clay, and lithic
debitage evince that the site was used primarily for habitation during this interval. All burials

INTRODUCTION /

were semiflexed, and most were placed on their right sides. Orientation of the head was predominantly to the north-northeast (about 56 percent). Seven Godley points included with an
adult male are the only offerings recovered from a Group 3 burial. Ceramics with sandy paste
were of an apparently early but uncertain type. Gary dart points were also associated with this
group.
The Late Prehistoric Group 4, dated to sometime between about A.D. 850 and 1560, was
comprised of 13 burials, flexed or semiflexed. About 71 percent were placed with the head to
the east-southeast. There were no grave inclusions. During this time, however, the site was
again evidently a cemetery and not a habitation site. Scallorn, Perdiz, and Dari points and ceramics of Goose Creek Plain, variety unspecified, and San Jacinto Plain, variety unspecified,
were associated with this group.
Hall (1981:302-303) proposed a model wherein Middle Archaic groups in the region were
small, relatively isolated groups of hunter-gatherers adapted to localized environments.
Growing Late Archaic and Woodland populations in the eastern United States created an improved communication and transportation system, termed by Hall the eastern import-export
sphere, that extended west through central Texas and that resulted in exchanges of artifacts and
raw materials throughout the system. Pressures on local populations forced this system to retract northeastward, leaving out central and coastal Texas after about A.D. 400, but continuing
into the Late Prehistoric period in eastern Texas (as evidenced by exotic artifacts and raw materials in Caddoan sites). After A.D. 400 the eastern influence and exchange is found only at
Woodland and Caddoan sites. Localized hunting and gathering subsistence, with the addition
of the bow and pottery, is found in central and coastal Texas.
The retreating westerly margin of the sphere reached the Allens Creek area between
A.D. 200 and A.D. 400, its passage marked by a shift in burial orientation, and by the
interment of at least five individuals who died violently. (Hall 1981:303)
Another prehistoric cemetery, the Albert George site (41FB13), 45 km (28 miles) east-northeast of Crestmont, has an artifact assemblage very similar to that of the Ernest Witte Group 2
and Crestmont sites. At least 17 burials and a variety of artifacts, many of them grave goods,
were excavated in 1951 and 1954 (Walley 1955). Two columella shell pendants, a broken
green granite boatstone, deer bone awls, plain and incised bone pins, sherds of Goose Creek
Plain (variety unspecified) pottery, and Gary type projectile points were most notable of the offerings.
The Albert George skeletons have not been described, and no orientation is mentioned for any
burial. Body position is noted for two: one semiflexed and one extended. The Albert George
incised bone pins (Walley 1955: Plates 36, 37, and 38) fall easily into the categories from Allens Creek (Hall 1981: Fig. 50, 225; Fig. 51, 229). The granite boatstone (Walley 1955: Plate
37) resembles those at Allens Creek (Hall 1981: Fig. 38). This site is assumed to be related to
Ernest Witte (41AU36) and Crestmont (41WH39), although how closely is yet undetermined.

METHODS

Cleaning
Only a few of the skeletal remains were cleaned immediately following their excavation, and
when this study was begun most were found as they had been packaged in the field. The
postcranial elements had been wrapped in tissue paper and/or aluminum foil, each bone or
body part (i.e., hands, spine) had been put into a paper bag, each postcranial skeleton had been
packed in a box. The skulls had not been wrapped or bagged but had been packed in fiberglass
insulating material in separate boxes. All bags and boxes carried the appropriate burial numbers. The postcranial bones were relatively soil-free, but the skulls had been cleaned on only
one side; the uncleaned sides had 7 to 10 cm of soil adhering to the bone, and all were filled
with soil.
All bones were cleaned for this study using tap water, soft brushes, bamboo splints, and dental
picks. The soil adhering to the bones was dry and clayey, and could be removed best by
dampening a small area, waiting for the dirt to soften, and gently scraping the treated area.
This procedure was repeated until the bone was free of most of the soil, and finally, the bone
was brushed and rinsed. Only one skeleton (Feature 5) was very difficult to clean. The dirt
adhering to the bones of this individual was exceedingly hard, suggesting a heat source (such
as a cooking fire) had been close enough to partially bake the clayey soil around the burial but
not close enough, or hot enough, to burn the bones.
All cleaning was done over a vegetable-colander screen. The screen was emptied after all
bones and fragments in each field bag had been washed.
Not all of the bones were washed. Some, held together only by soil, were simply brushed
with a damp brush and wiped with paper towels. Most of the long bones are still at least
partially filled with soil.
After soil removal, all bones were dried on tables in the laboratory, on paper towels and on top
of the field bags. After at least two days' drying time they were returned to the field bags until
all cleaning was completed, even when some of the bones obviously did not belong with the
bone or unit of bones noted on the bag. It was common to find, for example, a piece of fibula
in a sack marked "ankle bones" or pieces of vertebrae in a bag marked "ribs." Because the
skulls had been removed in blocks of soil, the first two, and sometimes more, cervical
vertebrae were in the blocks with the skulls. Phalanges of one hand often were found with
skulls, as were pieces of scapulae, clavicles, and ribs. Several artifacts and animal bones were
included with the skeletons (see Appendix A).

Preparation for Curation
After the bones had been washed and dried, they were inventoried and prepared for curation,
feature by feature. References for identifying bone fragments and describing the skeletons
were Gray's classic work on human anatomy (1901 edition), Bass (1971), and a comparative
skeleton.
Only a few burials were mixed (including parts of more than one individual) and, in all but one
instance, carefully labeled field bags gave warning. Except in the case of Feature C, where the
problem was not recognized in the field, the mixing was only partial, and the individuals involved were sufficiently different in size and/or age to allow fairly easy assignment of bones.
Two skeletons---called Features 1and2 on the field containers-had been at least partially ex-

cavated by the utility crew and were totally mixed. One of these individuals was 15 - 17 years
old and the other was an adult. Since it could not be determined which was Feature 1 and
which was Feature 2, these skeletons were renamed Features A and B. Among these mixed
skeletons were three left scapulae and five femoral shafts. These two extra partial bones made
it clear that a third individual, now designated Feature C, had also been found by the utility
crew.
None of the bones were treated with preservatives. They were labeled in ink with site and
feature numbers, and paired bones were sorted right and left. A few skulls were partially reconstructed with polyvinyl acetate glue. Where possible, long bones were reconstructed to aid
stature estimates and pathological assessments. All remains were put in plastic bags, also labeled with site and feature numbers and a list of the bones they contained. Inventory sheets
were completed during this process and any artifacts, skeletal anomalies or pathologies were
noted.
The skeletons have been packed, usually two to a box, and are curated at TARL. All records
generated in this analysis are on permanent file at TARL.

Aging and Sexing
Although the Crestmont skeletons are generally in fair condition, the sternal, pelvic, and sacral
bones were more often almost totally destroyed than any other bones. Sex was determined
from the predominant characteristics of the sciatic notch, preauricular sulcus, femoral head,
supraorbital ridges, nuchal crest, and mastoid process. Seldom were all of the features available for observation in one individual. Only two partial pubic symphases (Features 4 and 37)
and a fragment of a third (Feature 39) were available to aid in age assignments. All three were
of males. They were aged according to Todd's phases (in Krogman 1962:92-100). Feature 4
was judged to be 25 - 35 years old, Feature 37 to be about 35 and, from its fragmented pubis,
Feature 39 was judged to be over 29.
After these ages were obtained, all available adult dentitions were laid out on the laboratory
table. From stages of epiphyseal union, Feature A was judged to have been between 15 and 17
years old, the only individual in the group skeletally between adolescence and adulthood. Beginning with Feature A, all were arranged by degree of dental attrition (Brothwell 1963). Using the estimated ages of Features 4, 37, and 39, the individuals were then assigned to three
age categories: (1) under 25, (2) between 25 and 35, and (3) over 35. Only 16 of the 25 adults
could be included in these age classes because dentitions were not recovered from all features.
The ages of Features 9, 20, and 21 could not be determined because too many teeth were
missing. Comparisons of available characteristics with individuals of assigned ages indicate
that all three were more than 35 years old.
The six juveniles (Features 24, 31, 32, 33, 35, and 36) were assigned ages on the basis of
dental development from charts in Moorrees, Fanning, and Hunt (1963). These estimates are,
of course, fmer and more accurate than those of the adults. No attempt was made to determine
sex in individuals under 15 except for Feature 36.

Estimates of Stature
Stature estimates were based on Trotter and Gleser's formulas (in Krogman 1962:163); the
formula for Mongoloid males is applied to the males of the sample, and formulas for both
Mongoloid males and white females is applied to the females. Maximum bone lengths were
estimated whenever enough of the bone was recovered to permit a good approximation.

8 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39

Identification of Pathologies
All bones were examined superficially during the cleaning process. Informal notes made at that
time were bagged with the bones, and they were examined again macroscopically during inventorying and preparing the skeletons for curation. Pathologies and anomalies were noted on
the inventory sheets; identification and descriptions of these irregularities were made by comparison with descriptions and photographs in Steinbock (1976) and Ortner and Putschar
(1981), and with the help of Ann Magennis, a graduate student in the Department of Anthropology, University of Massachussetts. A form was devised for scoring and coding arthritic
changes, relying heavily on case descriptions and photographs in Ortner and Putschar
(1981:419--433).

Dental Analysis
Dental attrition was scored according to Scott's (1979) method. Enamel hypoplasias were recorded and evaluated in the youngest individuals following Goodman, Armelagos, and Rose
(1980). Attrition had destroyed enamel defects, if any had been present, in individuals over
age25.
In describing dentitions, the number which precedes or follows the letter designation for a
tooth, and the position of that number, are abbreviations to indicate exactly which tooth is
being described. "12" indicates the upper (maxillary) right lateral incisor; "1I" indicates the
lower (mandibular) left central incisor, etc.

Artifact Associations
Without access to the field notes and artifacts from the site, there are uncertainties surrounding
the offerings associated with the burials. As noted earlier, no artifact inventory was placed at
TARL by the excavators, nor are there detailed burial plans showing associated artifacts and
their placement within the graves, or photographs of the burials. What information is available
comes from the specimens recovered while cleaning the bones for this study (Appendix A) and
black-and-white photographs of artifacts in the TARL files (Appendix B). Because of these
limitations, the listing of artifacts associated with the burials may not be complete, and the
notations provided in Appendix B cannot be detailed.

Absolute Dating
Six samples of the best preserved human bones and one of deer bone were submitted to Dr.
Lynton Land, of the Department of Geologic Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, for
mass spectrometer analysis. The 013 values of all of these samples were heavy, ranging
between -5.4 and -8.4. In Dr. Land's opinion, the analysis indicated that none of the samples
was suitable for radiocarbon dating. Two samples--one of human bone and one of deerwere less crystalline than the others, but the probability of bone apatite exchange was too great
to permit making radiocarbon determinations with any confidence.
Disappointingly, the heavy 013 values also precluded even speculations on the diet of the
individuals interred at Crestmont (Vogel and van der Merwe 1977; Chisholm et al. 1982).
Only a relative date can be assigned to the Crestmont cemetery, but such a date is not to be
considered unsatisfactory or unreliable. Even before the present study, similarities between the
Crestmont burials and those in Burial Group 2 at the Ernest Witte site (41AU36)--dated

METHODS

I 9

between about 500 B.C. and A.D. 400---were apparent. Indeed, the resemblances are so
strong that, minimally, these two cemeteries must be considered partially contemporary.

DESCRIPTIONS OF SKELETONS
None of the skeletons from Crestmont is complete (Table 1). Parts of some were destroyed by
the digging equipment, one burial extended under the foundation of a newly built house and
was only partially recovered, and some appear to have been d~sturbed and partially destroyed
by later intrusive burials (Fig. 2). Generally, the bones are fairly well preserved. All of the
skulls are broken, and there are virtually no intact postcranial bones. Most are complete
enough to allow all of the observations attempted here except for a thorough analysis of
arthritic changes; the articular margins are missing too often to allow a complete assessment of
arthritis in any of the individuals.
The bones are soil-stained and brownish in color, but the color does not hinder observation.
Chemical processes have eroded the bones and probably obscured pathologies in some
individuals. Pathologies are described only where there was no doubt.
Dentitions are described in as much detail as possible. Many are incomplete (see Table 1), and
many are so eroded by antemortem attrition and/or postmortem chemical weathering that any
pathologies, particularly enamel defects (hypoplasias), that might have existed have been
obscured.
The practice of referring to the burials as features was continued in the laboratory; the burials
recognized in the field are identified by numbers, those recognized in the laboratory, by letters.
Gaps in the numerical sequence apparently represent features other than burials.
As depicted on the site plan, the only available source of information, these nonburial features
include:

Features 10, 13, 16, and 23-long trenches apparently related to house construction,
probably installation of utilities;
Features 17 and 26-roughly oval-shaped areas, 70 and 90 cm in maximum dimensions, respectively;
Feature 30--a circular area about 80 cm in diameter, enclosing a smaller circular area
(about 30 cm in diameter);
Feature 48--a crescent-shaped alignment of small objects (rocks and/or fired clay
lumps?) with scattered rocks or burned clay (?) within the arms of the crescent. This feature
extended over an area about 1 by 1 m and is immediately south of Feature 49, a burial.
This burial may intrude into Feature 48, but it is impossible to be certain of this or even to
be sure that Feature 48 is prehistoric in origin.
Features 7, 11, 12, 19, 27, 28, 29, 34, 38, 40, 45, and 46 do not appear on the site plan,
perhaps because these numbers were skipped or they refer to anomalies of such little
significance that they were not fully recorded. It is presumed that 49 was the last feature
number used.

Feature A
General Description
Male (?), age 15 - 17, stature undeterminable: a fairly complete, but chemically eroded,
skeleton. The skull is complete except for the palatine. The lower extremities were partially
destroyed by the digging equipment.

TABLE 1.

Burial Inventory, 41WH39.

1 -4
1-4

12 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
Pathology

Dental: The anterior teeth are crowded and slightly maloccluded. In the mandible, the central
incisors and left lateral incisor are crowded to the left and out of vertical alignment. A greater
degree of attrition has occurred on the labial-occlusal edge of these three teeth; they slant
downward from right to left. This condition may be due to the malocclusion or possibly to
some habit or use of the teeth for purposes other than chewing food. In the maxilla, the right
incisors are crowded, and the mesioproximal 12, having worn through the enamel, fits into the
lingual mesiodistal 11. There is a small cary on the occlusal M3, and two caries on the occlusal
3M. Five hypoplasias can be seen in four mandibular teeth, 11, Ii, h, and P2, indicating
nutritional stress at ages 1.5 - 2.0 , 2.0 - 2.5, and 4.0 - 4.5.
Cranial: Porotic hyperostosis. A small, shallow lesion on the external right frontal near the
coronal and just above the temporal is partly healed; a small portion along the superior edge
appears to have been still active at time of death. There is a second lesion, smaller and active,
at the center frontal. At the superior edge of the larger lesion, expansion of the diploe has
caused a slight bulge in the external table which continues, decreasing, toward bregma. The
left frontal is normal.
The external table of the frontal and parietal bones is pitted. The heaviest pitting is centered
around bregma. Light pitting continues on the right parietal almost to the lambdoidal suture,
following but avoiding the sagittal suture. There is minor pitting on the apex of the occipital.
There is a small area of woven bone extending posteriorly on the left lateral orbital margin.
About half of the orbital roofs are present; no cribra orbitalia were observed.

Postcranial: Chronic osteomyelitis. The proximal anterior and lateral aspect of the right
humerus are roughened and porous; there is a deep, active lesion on the anterior ridge just
below the humeral neck. Cortical thickness is normal. There is a small, active lesion on the
anterior ridge of the proximal left humerus.
Just below mid-shaft and extending upward almost to the lesser trochanter, the linea aspera of
the right femur is blurred by at least four small active lesions and areas of woven bone. The
medial cortex of the left femur is thickened just distally to mid-shaft, and the swollen area is
covered with and surrounded by porous woven bone that extends to and along the linea aspera.
There is an active lesion at the proximal edge of the swollen area.
Artifact Associations
Eight Lithospermum seed beads; for other possible associations, see Appendix B.

Feature B
General Description
Female, age 25 - 35, stature 166.31Â±3.80 cm: a well preserved but incomplete specimen;
some destruction due to mechanical digging equipment.
Pathology

Dental: The mandibular third molars are congenitally absent {maxillary third molars are fully
erupted). The enamel is worn off the whole lingual surface of 11. A fracture has removed the
enamel from the buccal Mi.
Cranial: Porotic hyperostosis. Pitting of the external table is generally centered around
bregma but extends farther anteriorly on the frontal than posteriorly on the parietals. Pitting is

DESCRIPTIONS OF SKELETONS / 13

heavier on the right parietal than on the left. No other part of the skull is affected, and the
diploic spaces appear normal throughout. No lesions were observed. About half of the orbital
roofs can be seen, and no cribra orbitalia are present
Artifact Associations
A shell pendant lying on right malar, for other possible associations, see Appendix B.

Feature C
General Description
Sex, age, and stature undeterminable: this individual, represented only by a fragment of the
left scapula and a small portion of the left femur, was not recognized in the field as a separate
burial. Although the mechanical ditch-digger destroyed part of the lower extremities of both
Features A and B (Features 1 and 2, Fig. 2), the fragmented femoral shafts of both are fairly
complete. The presence of the third left scapula confirms a third burial in this area.
Pathology
No pathology was observed.
Artifact Associations
None certain, but for possible associations, see Appendix B.

Feature 3
General Description
Male, age over 35, stature 173.26 Â± 4.60 cm: specimen is incomplete and highly eroded by
chemical weathering and some rodent-gnawing. The size of the bones and muscle markings
suggest a robust and very muscular individual.
On the left femur the linea aspera is hypertrophied; at mid-shaft and for 7 cm below that point,
it rises to a height of 5 mm above the body of the bone. There is no hypertrophy in the right
femur.
Pathology

Dental: The Mz, 1M, and 2M (and possibly 3M) were lost antemortem. Attrition on the
remaining molars is high and appears to be the cause of pulp-cavity exposure in lM and M2.
Postcranial: Degenerative arthritis. Moderate arthritic lipping of the right glenoid fossa of the
humerus. Slight lipping of one proximal phalanx of the right hand. No arthritic changes were
seen in the elbows. Other common sites for arthritis were too incomplete for observation.
Artifact Associations
None noted.

14 I THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39

Feature 4
General Description
Male, age 25 - 35, stature 178.25 Â± 3.80 cm: an incomplete, eroded specimen. Except for the
lambdoidal, the cranial sutures are almost completely closed.
Pathology
Dental: Two small caries are in the occlusal surface of M3, and another in the buccal 3M.
Small fractures are found on the mesiobuccal M2, mesiobuccal Ml, lingual M2, and mesial M2.
The enamel is worn off the whole lingual surface of 1I and from more than half of the labial
surface. The I2 was possibly lost antemortem.
Cranial: Porotic hyperostosis. The external table is badly eroded near bregma, but some
pitting is still observable. Closely spaced, fine pits are seen farther back on the right parietal,
well below the sagittal suture. There is some diploic expansion in the right parietal. The
superior part of the left parietal is missing, but one central fragment has definite pitting, slight
diploic expansion, and a thickened external table. The anterior third of each orbital roof is
present, and there are three fine pits in the center right.
Postcranial: Degenerative arthritis. There is slight to moderate arthritic lipping in both elbows
and on the margins of the bodies of the sixth and seventh cervical and first, third, and fourth
lumbar vertebrae. No arthritic changes were seen in the temperomandibular joint, the shoulder,
hip, knee, or upper cervical vertebrae. Margins at other common sites were absent.

Artifact Associations
Two modified deer antlers (see Fig. 3) and two bone ornaments, possibly pendants, from
under right pelvis; for other possible associations, see Appendix B.

Feature 5
General Description
Sex and stature undeterminable, age over 35: a fragmented, incomplete, and poorly preserved
specimen, but obviously a smaller individual than most of the adults of the group. This
skeleton was difficult to clean because of the clayey soil adhering to it. The soil appeared
partially baked.
Pathology
Dental: One cary in the distal 3M (only 10 teeth are present; the remainder were postmortem
losses).
Cranial: Porotic hyperostosis. Pitting of the external table is seen on the posterior parietals
and the superior occipital. The frontal bone is highly eroded., but the pitting appears to stop
posteriorly to the coronal suture. There is, however, slight diploic expansion in the right
frontal and in the left posterior parietal. The diploe of the right parietal is less expanded than
the left.

Artifact Associations
None noted.

Feature 6
General Description
Male, age 25 - 35, stature 163.41Â±4.66 cm: an incomplete but fairly well preseived specimen. The right clavicle and humerus are noticeably more robust than the left. There is no appreciable difference in the sizes of the ulnae and radii.
Pathology
Dental: Carious abscess in iP, resulted in tooth death. There is one small cary in the buccal
3M, two small caries in the occlusal M3, and a small fracture of the occlusal/buccal 1M.
Almost half of the enamel is worn off the labial 11
Cranial: Porotic hyperostosis. No pitting is obseived in the ectocranium, but there is slight
diploic expansion throughout the central superior frontal bone. Slight expansion in the left
parietal begins at the sagittal suture, increases at the cUIVe, and tapers abruptly to normal above
the temporal. There is an 8xl0 mm active lesion in the ectocranium, on the cUIVe of the
forehead, just to the right of center; it appears on the endocranial table, measuring 5x5 mm
there. The anterior third of the left orbital roof is present, but no cribra orbitalia were
obseived.
Postcranial: Trauma. Displaced fracture, right radius at mid-shaft, healed without realignment.
Artifact Associations
Seven marine shell beads, one unmodified (?) Busycon sp. columella, one incised bone pin,
and, probably as an accidental inclusion, an edge-modified flake or chip.

16 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39

Feature 8
General Description
Female (?), age over 35, stature undeterminable: this is a very incomplete, fragmented, and
eroded specimen. The skull is incomplete, but all sutures are nearly closed. Another indication
of advanced age are the 21 teeth present which are so worn that only the mandibular second
and third molars (4) and incisors (4) and the maxillary central incisors (2) could be positively
identified. One premolar and two canines were identified, but their positions are undetermined.
Pathology

Cranial: Porotic hyperostosis. Pitting of the external table could not be determined because of
high postmortem erosion. There is, however, slight diploic expansion in the frontal bone and
moderate expansion in both parietals.
Postcranial: Degenerative arthritis. Pronounced lipping of the articular facets of the atlas; no
other vertebrae could be observed Pronounced lipping of one second phalanx, right (?) hand.
Artifact Associations
One marine shell pendant and, probably as an accidental inclusion, an edge-modified flake or
chip.

Feature 9
General Description
Female, age over 35, stature 168.97 Â± 4.66 cm: an incomplete specimen. The skull is crushed
and distorted.
Pathology

Dental: All maxillary molars and premolars were lost antemortem, and resorption is complete.
The Mi, P2. and probably 1M were also antemortem losses. The condyle of the left mandible
is flattened and lipped.

Postcranial: Chronic osteomyelitis, possibly becoming systemic (acute). Cortical thickening is
seen at the distal end of the left femoral shaft; several active and one healing lesion are in the
same area. Only the tibia shafts are present; both are severely swollen and distorted by
irregularly thickened cortex with several active and one or two healing lesions. The fibulae are
represented by only small fragments of the shafts. The cortex of both shafts is irregularly
thickened, and there are several lesions, both active and resorptive, on each end. There is a
mild periosteal reaction at the center posterior left clavicle, with a small, active lesion.
Degenerative Arthritis. There is slight arthritic lipping bilaterally at the humeroulnar joint, and
of the body of the axis. One phalanx of the hand has pronounced lipping. Other common sites
of arthritic lipping are too incomplete to be assessed.
Artifact Associations
Three modified deer antlers, one bone projectile point (?), one piece of sandstone, and one deer
vertebra from under the right pelvis; for other possible associations, see Appendix B.

DESCRIPTIONS OF SKELEIONS / 17

Feature 14
General Description
Female, age and stature undeterminable: this skeleton was nearly destroyed by a mechanical
ditch-digger. Only a partial skull and the first and second cervical vertebrae were recovered.
Pathology
No pathology was observed.
Artifact Associations
Ten marine(?) shell pendants (one from behind the right mandible), one decorated marine shell
gorget, two pieces of conch shell lx>dy whorl, and one abraded sandstone slab.

Feature 15
General Description
Female (?), age and stature undeterminable: this burial extended under the foundation of a
house, so only a partial postcranial skeleton was recovered. Femoral fusion is complete. The
general impression is of a young adult female, smaller than most other females of the group.
Pathology
No pathology was observed.
Artifact Associations
None noted.

Feature 18
General Description
Male, age over 35, stature 172.98 Â± 4.60 cm: rather poorly preserved, partial skeleton, one of
the oldest individuals in the group. The cranial sutures are nearly closed.
Pathology
Dental: One small cary in the occlusal 3M. Carious exposure of the pulp cavity, 2M. Antemortem tooth losses include h, 2P, 1M, M3, 12, and 3M (possibly the mandibular canine also).
The upper central incisors are dark brown, worn almost to the roots, and the pulp cavities are
exposed. Only a thin, narrow ring of enamel remains on these teeth above the neck. On the
labial side of the right central incisor, all enamel has worn away. The teeth in the mandibular
arch from Mi through 1P are also dark brown.
Postcranial: Degenerative arthritis. There is slight arthritic lipping in the left elbow. No other
common sites of arthritic changes could be observed.

Artifact Associations
One chert flake, probably a fortuitous inclusion.

18 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39

Feature 20
General Description
Female, age over 35, stature undeterminable: this is an incomplete specimen with high
postmortem erosion of the skull which may obscure evidence of porotic hyperostosis (this
individual is not included in the summary of that pathology). The postcranial bones are porous
and give the impression of an individual of advanced age.
Pathology
Dental: Only three teeth remain in the maxilla: 11, 12, and Pl. All others are antemortem losses
and resorption is complete. The mandibular dentition is complete except for postmortem losses
of It, h, and 21. There is a small fracture on the mesiolingual 1P.
Postcranial: Degenerative arthritis. There is slight to mcxlerate arthritic lipping in both elbows.
There is pronounced lipping on the body margins of the fifth cervical vertebra, but none on the
second, third, or fourth vertebra. No other common sites of arthritis could be observed.
Artifact Associations
Fourteen Busycon sp. columella beads.

Feature 21
General Description
Female, age over 35, stature 159.58 Â± 4.66 cm: an incomplete, fragmented skeleton. Apparently excavation was halted before the skull was recovered (Fig. 2).
Pathology
Postcranial: Degenerative arthritis. Two phalanges of the right hand are fused, and another
has pronounced lipping. The margins of the body of the first sacral vertebra are pronouncedly
lipped. No other common sites of arthritis could be obseived.
Anomaly

Two grooves, or depressions, on the internal surface of each innominate begin near the sciatic
notches and run upward and outward toward the iliac crests.
Artifact Associations
One shell bead.

Feature 22
General Description
Sex, age, and stature undeterminable: this individual is represented by only distal fragments of
the left tibia and fibula, the tali and five incomplete bones of the left foot, and three of the right
foot.
Pathology
No pathology was observed.

DESCRIPTIONS OF SKELETONS / 19

Artifact Associations
None noted.

Feature 24
General Description
Sex and stature undeterminable, age 9 .5 - 10: a very incomplete and fragmented specimen.
The dentition, however, lacks only 11and11, which were postmonem losses. In addition to
erupted and unerupted permanent teeth, there are six deciduous molars.
Pathology

Dental: Enamel hypoplasias indicate nutritional stress at age 2 - 3.5 and again at 5 - 5.5.
Anifact Associations
Three Busycon sp. columella, one shell disc bead, and, perhaps an accidental inclusion, one
bone or shell item.

Feature 25
General Description
Male, age over 35, stature 167.07 Â± 4.25 cm: this is an incomplete skeleton, but the bones are
fairly well preserved. The cranial sutures are nearly obliterated, but the dentition and postcranials do not indicate very advanced age.
Pathology

Dental: A large abscess, about 9 mm in diameter, pierces the right maxilla at the root of the
absent P2, touching the roots of both Pl and Ml (Fig. 4c). Decay and/or fracture have destroyed Pl; only the root remains. A large cary has exposed the pulp cavity in Ml.
Postcranial: Degenerative arthritis. There is one lesion in each glenoid fossa. The proximal
margins of the humerus are absent. The right proximal ulna has moderate lipping; the left has
none. The margins of both radii are missing. The left patella is moderately lipped at the distal
margins. Carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges have slight to pronounced marginal lipping.
The vertebral margins could not be observed.
Anifact Associations
Red ochre, panial deer (juvenile) maxilla containing the second and third premolars (Fig. 4b),
and a first phalanx (Fig. 4a), also from a juvenile deer.

Feature 31
General Description
Sex and stature undeterminable, age 13: this is a very incomplete, fragmented skeleton.

kind and amount of dental attrition is fairly representative of the older adults at Wharton.

Pathology

Dental: One very small intercuspal cary in the buccal 2M. In 2M, a small cary in the
occlusa1/distal surface, and a small fracture in the mesial. In Mi, there is a small fracture in the
distal surface. A larger fracture is observed in the mesial M2. Hypoplasias in the right mandibular canine and fa indicate nutritional stress from age 2 - 4.
Postcranial: Beginning chronic (?) osteomyelitis. There is a faint, thin layer of woven bone
on the proximal half of the right femur, medial aspect, surrounding what appears to be a
healing lesion. On the posterior left humerus is a long, narrow, active lesion; no woven bone
was obsetved here.

DESCRIPTIONS OF SKELETONS / 21

Artifact Associations
Deer phalanx and distal fibula, perhaps chance inclusions, and two Busycon sp. columella
beads.

Feature 32
General Description
Sex and stature undeterminable, age 6 - 6.S: this is an incomplete, fragmented skeleton but the
bones are fairly well preserved. The incomplete dentition consists of deciduous and permanent
teeth.
Pathology

Dental: Dark enamel on the interproximal facets of the deciduous Pl and p2 appears to be
early decay. Hypoplasias can be seen on the maxillary right canine, 12 and 11, and on the
mandibular right canine, h and 2.M, indicating nutritional stress from age 2 - 6.
Postcranial: Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis; cause of death. Except for the vertebrae and,
possibly, the ribs, all postcranial elements (Table 1) are affected.
Ribs: Four fragments of lower right ribs may have a very slight, beginning deposit of
reactive bone.
Clavicles: The ends of both clavicles are absent. The anterior/superior surface of the right
clavicle is covered by woven bone over about a third of its full length. The left clavicle is
abnormally flat for nearly the full length of the bone present (about three-fourths of the
whole); it begins to round toward the proximal end. Woven bone begins at mid-shaft and
widens to cover the distal anterior/superior surface. Some of the porous bone has broken
off, and two layers can be seen overlying the linearly eroded original cortex.
Scapulae: Only two fragments of each scapula are present. The left one includes part of
the lateral base of the spine and a fragment of the axillary border; the right one includes a
part of the the spine and glenoid fossa and a fragment of the axillary border. Woven bone
is observed on both spinal bases on the inferior surfaces, more on the left than on the right.
Humeri: Except for parts of the proximal and distal metaphyses and the epiphyses, the
right humerus is complete. The anterior crest is blurred medially by a small active lesion
and its surrounding patch of woven bone. On the posterior crest, at about the level of the
nutrient foramen, woven bone thickens and spreads quickly to encompass the entire distal
end. It continues into the olecranon fossa but has not invaded the entire fossa (Fig. Sb).
Above the lateral epicondyle, postmortem breakage has exposed the original cortical surface. Three layers of reactive bone can be seen, only loosely laminated to one another and
to the original surface (Fig. Sc). The original cortex appears to have undergone little remodeling; it is slightly roughened but lacks the striated appearance of the clavicles. An active lesion on the center posterior penetrates all three layers of woven bone.
Only the proximal left humeral shaft was recovered. There is an active lesion medially on
the proximal anterior crest accompanied by a tiny patch of woven bone beginning at the
distal edge of the lesion and continuing along the crest.
Ulnae: The proximal part of the right ulna was recovered. One layer of woven bone
apparently covered this whole section. Where the bone is broken-at about mid-shaftporous bone on the posterior is 3.S mm thick (overlying the original 2 mm cortex), but

22 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
thins toward the anterior as it encircles the bone. Where the woven bone is broken away,
the cortical surface is deeply eroded in linear striations. Near the proximal end of the
incomplete bone there is a small, active lesion on the medial aspect and another on the
lateral apect; both lesions penetrate to the cortex.
The distal part of the left ulna was recovered. Where the bone is broken at about mid-shaft,
a 3-mm single layer of woven bone covers the medial aspect, thinning toward the distal
end. This porous bone is broken away but appears to have encompassed the bone at midshaft, probably thinning as it descended and stopping at about 3 cm below mid-shaft.
Remodeling of the cortex has occurred on the posterior as on the humerus. No lesions
were observed.
Femora: A 4-cm fragment of the right distal femur has a thin layer of woven bone that
extends across the entire anterior surface and the lateral half of the posterior surface.
Postmortem erosion has removed this layer from the medial half of the posterior surface.
The original cortex has been remcxleled only a little less than has that of the right ulna.
A 7 .5-cm section of the left distal femur is heavily eroded by postmortem chemical weathering. It appears to have been unremcxleled by disease.
Tibiae: The right tibia, though broken, is represented by most of the proximal end and
shaft. Remnants of porous woven bone heavily ercxled by chemical weathering can still be
seen on the proximal anterior crest, but apparently they did not extend very far along the
shaft.
The left tibia is fragmented but fairly complete. Beginning at least at the superior anterior
crest, a single 1- to 2-mm layer of woven bone covers the whole medial aspect and extends
over the crest to affect the anterior half of the lateral aspect (Fig. Sa). On the anterior crest,
just above mid-shaft, remcxleling of the porous original bone surfaces is nearly complete.
Fibulae: The entire lateral aspect of the distal end of the left fibula is covered with
periosteal reactive bone. The same area of the right fibula is also affected but not so
severely or extensively. There were no lesions on either bone.
Artifact Associations
Red ocher.

Feature 33
General Description
Sex and stature underminable, age 9 months: the skull vault is fragmented but fairly complete.
There is a fragment of the mandible, 11 deciduous teeth, and the unfinished crowns of five
permanent teeth. A few fragments of cervical vertebrae are the only postcranial elements
recovered.
Pathology
No pathology was observed.
Artifact Associations
Red ocher.

Feature 35
General Description
Sex and stature undeterminable, age 10 - 11: this individual is represented by an incomplete
skull and one fragment of the atlas.
Pathology

Dental: There is a large cary in the permanent M2 mesial surface and a small cary in the facing
distal surface of the permanent Mi, a small cary in the distal occlusal permanent 2M, and another, larger one in the mesial surface. There is a small intercuspal cary in the buccal surface of

24 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39

the deciduous iM. Hypoplasias that might have existed have been obliterated by postmortem
erosion.
Artifact Associations
Two shell ornaments.

Feature 36
General Description
Male(?), age 13-14.5, stature undetenninable: a nearly complete specimen. The dentition is
complete, but all third molars are unerupted. All cranial indicators of sex suggest that this is a
male.
Pathology

Dental: The occlusal surfaces of M1 and 2M each have a small cary. Hypoplasias in the
maxillary central and left lateral incisors, the canine, and the mandibular canines indicate
nutritional stress from age 1.5 - 6.
Postcranial: Chronic osteomyelitis. Patches of woven bone are on the proximal left femur.
There is a large, active lesion just mediallyÂ·to the linea aspera at mid-shaft and another larger
lesion on the anterior aspect just below the proximal metaphysis. Between these lesions is
highly eroded woven bone with some areas appearing resorptive. The observable parts of the
right femur are unaffected. On the right tibia there are two thin patches of woven bone and two
active lesions just below mid-shaft on the medial aspect The left tibia appears to be unaffected.
The cortex of the affected bones is normal.

General Description
Male, age over 35, stature 172.27 Â± 3.27 cm: although fragmented, this skeleton is the best
preserved of the group, and is nearly complete (Table 1).

DESCRIPTIONS OF SKELETONS / 25

Pathology

Dental: Decay has exposed the pulp cavities in both maxillary first molars. There is one
fracture each on the mesial/buccal quarters of both maxillary second molars, another on the
mesial Mi, and another at the distal/lingual quarter of 2.M.
Postcranial: Trauma; probable cause of death. A chert dart point fragment (base missing) is
embedded in the right humerus (Fig. 6); there is no evidence of infection or healing. Where it
extrudes from the bone, the point is 23 mm wide and 6 mm thick. The fissure in the humeral
head extends 41 mm above the edge of the point (Fig. 6b) and 9 mm below. Notes on a photograph on file at TARL indicate that another dart point (Fig. 6c) was found inside the rib cage
of this individual and a third (Fig. 6d) was recovered from beneath the pelvis. No wounds
were observed on the sternum (the xiphoid process is absent), the ribs, or on the anterior surfaces of the vertebrae. In view of the good condition of this skeleton, the absent xiphoid process may be related to the entry of a second dart point, but this is not certain since the xiphoid
process is not always calcified. Whether these second and third dart points were grave inclusions or associated with the death is not established.
Degenerative arthritis. The left shoulder is unaffected, but the right glenoid fossa has moderate
lipping. The left humerus and the femora are slightly lipped at the distal margins. There is
slight interphalangeal lipping in the right hand. In the left hand, arthritic changes vary from
moderate lipping of the interphalangeal surfaces to fusion of the second and third phalanges of
the fourth finger. Five cervical vertebrae are unaffected. The superior surface of the body of
C-5 is moderately lipped, the inferior surface is partially destroyed by lesions, as is the superior body surface of C-6. The inferior surface of C-6 is unaffected. There is osteophytosis at
the inferior margins of both C-5 and C-6, but the vertebrae are not fused. There is slight to
moderate lipping on eight thoracic vertebral bodies and slight to pronounced lipping on four
lumbar and on the first two sacral vertebrae. The margins of the foot bones are too incomplete
to score.
Artifact Associations
Seven bone pins, at least two decorated, 37 Busycon sp. columella beads, one biface, and
three dart points (including fragmentary specimen embedded in the humerus).

Feature 39
General Description
Male, age over 35, stature 176.57 1Â± 3.27 cm: a fairly complete specimen with cranial sutures
almost closed.
Pathology

Dental: The lM was lost antemortem. There are four aveolar abscesses in the mandible, at
Mi, 1P, 1M, and 2.M, with resultant death of iM and Mi. Additionally, a fracture has removed
most of the remaining thin enamel from the lingual Mi. There is an unusual pattern of wear in
the opposing left canines. In the mandibular canine, the occlusal surface is angled high on the
lingual to low on the labial so that the occlusal/lingual margin is about halfway down the crown
and the pulp cavity is exposed. Only a thin ring of enamel remains, along the neck, on the
labial surface. Attrition has greatly reduced the maxillary canine crown; the occlusal surface is
flat and all the enamel is worn off the labial surface except at the mesial/labial margin.
Considering the high attrition and disease in the molars, which would have made normal
chewing difficult and painful, this pattern is most likely to have developed as an aid to
mastication.

DESCRIPTIONS OF SKELETONS / 27

Cranial: Porotic hyperostosis. The external table is pitted, beginning on the frontal near
bregma and continuing across the superior parietals; the pitting is more dense on the left than
on the right. Pitting stops abruptly at the lambdoidal suture. There is slight expansion of the
diploe in the frontal and parietals. No lesions were observed. About half of each orbital roof
is present; no cribra orbitalia were observed.
Postcranial: Trauma. Displaced fracture of the right fourth metatarsal, healed without
realignment.
Degenerative arthritis. There is moderate to pronounced lipping of the glenoid fossae; the
margins of the humeral heads are absent. There is moderate to pronounced lipping in both
elbows. The superior margins of the patellae are moderately lipped. The hands and feet appear
to be unaffected. The cervical and thoracic vertebrae are highly fragmented, but there is slight
lipping on the body margins of C-5 and C-6 and pronounced lipping on the body of one lower
thoracic vertebra. There are only partial bodies of four lumbar vertebrae; these could not be
assigned a position. Three of these have pronounced lipping, and the fourth has osteophytosis
and thinning of the body. The sacral vertebrae could not be scored.
Artifact Associations
One marine shell gorget and, probably as accidental inclusions, three flakes.

Feature 41
General Description
Female(?), age over 35, stature undeterminable: this is a fairly complete but badly eroded
specimen. Dental attrition and resorption are so great that only 13 of the 21 teeth could be
positively identified. No caries or fractures were seen. The bones of the vault are quite thick.
The diploic spaces appear to be expanded but the external table is so ercxied that the presence or
absence of pitting could not be determined. The bone thickness may be due to advanced age.
This individual is not included in the summary of porotic hyperostosis.
Pathology
No pathology was observed.
Artifact Associations
One marine shell gorget, one marine shell bead, and, probably as accidental inclusions, a
fragment of a deer humerus and two flakes.

Feature 42
General Description
Male, age under 25, stature undeterminable: this is an incomplete specimen, but the postcranial
elements are well preserved. The external table of the skull is badly eroded, and only remnants
of the original surface can be seen. The endocranial surfaces of the parietals are covered by a
thin layer of weakly cemented fine sand. The vault is thick and heavy. The thickness is
pathological, but the increased weight is due, apparently, to sand infiltrating the bone.
Pathology

Dental: Both mandibular central incisors overlap the lateral incisors. In the maxilla the left
second premolar is rotated and out of alignment with its neighboring teeth; it sits toward the

28 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
lingual side. The root is slightly stunted. Nutritional stress at ages 1.5 - 2 and 3 - 4.5 is
indicated by hypoplasias on the 21 and the left mandibular canine.
Cranial: Porotic hyperostosis. Pitting is apparent in the extant external surface of the right
parietal and right frontal bones, near bregma. Diploic expansion could be observed in these
two bones (others are absent or were unbroken). The diploe is slightly expanded in the frontal
bone at the coronal suture, tapering to normal just above the forehead. The diploe of the
anterior right parietal is similar to that of the frontal, but expansion in the posterior part is great
near the sagittal suture, tapering rather abruptly to normal well above the temporal region. The
left parietal is unbroken and the diploe could not be observed there. No lesions were observed.
More than half of each orbital roof is present and no cribra orbitalia were observed.
Artifact Associations
One marine shell gorget, 10 Busycon sp. columella beads, one bone ornament (found with the
skull), and, perhaps as an accidental inclusion, a cobble.

Feature 43
General Description
Sex, age, and stature undeterminable: only the lower extremities and hands of this skeleton
were recovered. The rest may have been destroyed by an intrusive burial, Feature 44A (Fig.
2). All of the bones are incomplete.
Pathology
Postcranial: Chronic osteomyelitis. Both tibiae, represented only by the shafts, are swollen
and distorted by cortical thickening (Fig. 7), the left affected more than the right. On the left
tibia, there are active lesions on the posterior toward the medial aspect at the proximal end, and
on the anterior, lateral, and medial aspects. Any lesions that might have been on the right tibia
are obscured by rodent gnawing. No pathology was seen in the few fragments of the distal
femora.
Artifact Associations
Partial deer tibia, believed to be a deliberate inclusion.

Feature 44A
General Description
Male (?), age 25 - 35, stature undeterminable: this is a very incomplete specimen, but the
bones present are fairly well preserved.
Pathology
Dental: Exposed pulp cavity in 11 due to fracture. There is a small cary in the distal occlusal
surface of M3, one in 3M, and a fracture in the distal lingual/occlusal 2M.

Cranial: Porotic hyperostosis. Pitting of the external surfaces of the frontal and parietals is
centered roughly at bregma. The pitting extends much lower on the left frontal than on the
right. There is a small healing lesion on the frontal, just left of bregma. Only the anterior part
of the right parietal is affected, but apparently the whole superior surface of the left was
affected. There is a nearly healed lesion at the center left parietal, near the sagittal suture. No
expansion of the diploe was observed in any cranial bones. About half of each orbital roof is
present; no cribra orbitalia were observed.
Artifact Associations
Thirty-seven Lithospermum sp. seed beads, plus fragments representing at least that many
more, were found with the skull.

30 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39

Feature 448
General Description
Sex, age, and stature undeterminable: a very incomplete skeleton, probably partially destroyed
by a later intrusive burial, Feature 44A (Fig. 2). There are two fragments of frontal bones and
incomplete occipital and parietals. The right temporal is fragmented but observable. The only
postcranial elements are an incomplete left humerus, a fragment of the right (?) humerus, and a
fragment of the right femur.
Pathology
No pathology was observed.
Artifact Associations
None noted.

Feature 47
General Description
Female (?), age 25 - 35, stature undeterminable: an incomplete and fragmented specimen. The
bones present indicate an individual much smaller than most other females of this group.
Pathology
No pathology was observed.
Artifact Associations
None noted.

Feature 49
General Description
Male, age over 35, stature 165.67 Â± 3.80 cm: a well preserved and nearly complete specimen.
On the site plan (Fig. 2), it appears that this burial intruded into the edge of a crescent-shaped
alignment and scatter of rocks and/or fired clay (?). Whether this is a separate occupational
feature or part of this burial is unknown.
This burial is notable in that it appears to be the only flexed burial and is placed well away from
the remainder of the group. Based on the well established sequence of burial positions at the
Witte site, it is believed to be the last burial at Crestmont.
Pathology
Dental: The IM, 2P, and possibly the Mi were lost antemortem. Both mandibular third
molars were lost antemortem, or were congenitally absent; the posterior parts of the maxilla are
absent. There is a supernumerary central incisor in the maxilla: a stunted crown and root can
be seen in the alveola above and between the central incisors. It is inverted; the root is below
the crown. No caries or fractures were observed.
Postcranial: Severe degenerative arthritis. Considerable damage has occurred in the cervical
vertebrae. The articulating right transverse processes of C-3 and C-4 are thinned, spread, and
ebumated. On C-3 the eburnated area measures 6x12 mm in the midst of a very porous

DESCRIPTIONS OF SKELETONS / 31

surface. Beginning on the inferior surface of the axis body and continuing through the body of
C-5, a few narrow, serpentine bony remnants remain above the porous surfaces, giving them a
roughened appearance. Eburnated patches appear on the body margins, anteriorly and/or
posteriorly and/or laterally on the inferior surfaces of C-2 through the superior surface of C-7.
Parts of the bodies of C-3 through C-5 are worn away by bone rubbing against bone; the
porous surfaces are eburnated. The anterior margin of the superior C-4 body is totally worn
away; the body slants, at about a 40Â° angle, toward the inferior margin, where there is
osteophytosis. Erosive lesions on several body surfaces are suggestive of Schmarl's node.
One of these lesions, on the superior surface of C-5 at the center of the anterior margin,
measures 3x5 mm. The spinous process of C-4 is malformed; it points toward the left rather
than straight back. Since C-3 and C-4 have suffered the most damage, it seems probable that
this anomaly contributed to the degenerative problem. There is no evidence of trauma.
Only one fragment each of two thoracic vertebrae is present; no lipping or lesions were
observed. Also present are two fragments of two lumbar bodies; lipping is moderate to
pronounced in these specimens.
There is slight lipping of the right distal radius and on the right metacarpophalangeal articular
surfaces. The same margins of the left hand are moderately to pronouncedly lipped, and the
third phalanx of the fifth finger is fused to the second at a slight angle. The patellae are
incomplete; the margins of the right patella are absent, but the articular surfaces observable are
apparently normal. The articular surfaces of the left patella are roughened, and the small part of
the margin that could be seen is pronouncedly lipped. There are degenerative lesions on the
distal margins of the first right metatarsal. The left foot is unaffected.
Artifact Associations
None noted.

ANALYSIS AND SITE COMPARISONS
Comparative Samples
Four samples of skeletal materials have been selected for comparison with the Crestmont
population: those from the Ernest Witte site (41AU36), already described; the Harris County
Boys' School site (41HR.80), south of Houston; the Peikert site (41WH14), just north of
Crestmont; and the Libben site, in northern Ohio.
Athough much smaller, the Crestmont cemetery closely resembles one of the Witte burial
groups. Photographs of artifacts from Crestmont burials show some that appear identical to
some from the Witte Group 2; burial practices were similar and there were no ceramics directly
associated with burials at either site. Similarities were expected in the demographic and
pathologic statistics.
The Witte site is described in the archeological background section. Data presented here are
compiled from the Allens Creek report (Hall 1981). The archeologist who supervised the
excavations and the physical anthropologists who analyzed the skeletal remains disagreed on
the number of individuals represented in Group 2. The archeologist counted 145 individuals
(Hall 1981:53-56), the physical anthropologists counted 223 (Malina and Bramblett 1981:326-327). Therefore, although the pathologic and demographic statistics used below for Group 2
burials are based on 223 individuals, data-on mortuary practices are based on 145 (Table 2).
The effects of this discrepancy are somewhat mitigated by the large size of the sample.

*Head orientation and placement of the body could not be determined in all cases. Percentages are based on the
nÂ·\mbers of burials shown at top of table.

While the Crestmont burials resemble only the Witte Group 2 burials, Group 2 should not be
lifted out of its context. The dates given in Table 2 overlap only between Groups 3 and 4, but
some burial traditions appear to overlap somewhat between Groups 1 and 2 and between
Groups 2 and 3, particularly orientation and positioning of the body.
The Peikert site, 41WH14, about 6 km (4 miles) northwest of Hungerford, Texas, and about
14 km (8.6 miles) north-northwest of Crestmont, appears to have been a simultaneous habitation and burial site. Eleven burials, apparently all that were present, were excavated in 1979
from four stratigraphic levels by members of the Houston Archeological Society. Lithic arti32

facts (Hudgins and Kindall 1984) and skeletal descriptions (Copas 1984) have been published.
Ceramics were found but have not yet been described. Projectile point types indicate use of the
site from the Middle or Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. Peikert was chosen for comparison with Crestmont because of its proximity and the bioarcheological information available.
This small sample is divided into four strata. Table 3 is compiled from Copas (1984) and
presents the data in his chronological interpretation from oldest (Stratum 1) to most recent
(Stratum 4).
With the exception of the multiple burial in Stratum 3. the preferred headward orientation is
definitely southward-inclinations to the west or east are very slight-and body posture is
consistently semiflexed. Drastic changes are seen only in the last burial (Stratum 4) which
intruded into Burial 11, Stratum 2.
The exceptions to this orderly pattern are the individuals of the seemingly expedient multiple
burial. Copas (1984:6) states that "...they were apparently loosely heaped into a pit, one atop
another, with no apparent preparation.... " All three were adults, one female and two males. A
projectile point was found in association with one male and is believed to be the cause of death.
Probably all three died in a violent confrontation and were buried hastily. They need not be
considered separately; the practicality of the deviation appears clear.
Since, with the above exception, burial practices prior to the last interment are nearly identical,
the site may have been a burial ground for only a relatively brief part of the time span indicated
by the artifact assemblage.

About 101 km (63 miles) east-northeast of Crestmont, in the Galveston Bay area, a prehistoric
cemetery at the Harris County Boys' School site (41HR80} was excavated in 1969-1972 (Aten
et al. 1976). The remains of 32 individuals were recovered. Associated and isolated artifacts
and radiocarbon dates indicate that the major use of the site was preceramic but that habitation
continued into ceramic periods. Significant occupation of the site appears to have ended about
A.O. 600, and the burials seem to postdate habitation (Aten et al. 1976:12, 51). Artifacts
recovered include ceramics, bone and shell beads, and bone and antler projectile points. With
one exception, the intact burials were flexed or, infrequently, semiflexed, most with one hand
to the face or arms crossed on the chest or pelvis (Aten et al. 1976:57-63). The exception, a
primary but later disturbed burial, was an infant (possibly newborn) that had been placed inside
a ceramic vessel. The artifact assemblage indicates that the Boys' School burials are later than

34 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
those at Crestmont. This population was chosen for demographic and pathologic comparisons
because the sample size is equal.
The Libben site (Lovejoy et al. 1977) is a Late Woodland perennially occupied habitation and
burial site in northern Ohio, dating to about A.D. 800--1100. Although quite distant from
Crestmont, of a different time period, and representing different peoples, the Libben cemetery
population is a useful prehistoric demographic model because of its size and the completeness
of the excavations and demographic analysis. The following points made by Lovejoy et al. are
particularly important to this study:
The outstanding preservation and completeness of the site and the utilization of an
exhaustive aging methodology make this the largest and most comprehensively
censused North American prehistoric cemetery. Survivorship data indicate a robust,
successful population ....
... 85 to 90 percent of [the] extant site [was excavated] ....
The Libben population also exhibits the more typical low infant mortality and high adult
mortality of many skeletal series and thus contrasts inversely with most extant
'anthropological populations' ....
This general discrepancy .. .is usually attributed to underenumeration of infants and
errors of age estimation among adults ....
To raise the Libben figure to the average for these [anthropological] populations would
require the undetected loss of more than 225 children. Archeologically, this would have
be.en virtually impossible at Libben. (Lovejoy et al. 1977:291-293)
Compiled from some of the best possible archeologically derived data, the Libben statistics are
taken as a starting point, a standard Late Woodland sample against which to measure these
Texas populations. Comparisons of Libben with the Texas sites have had to be limited to
demography since descriptions of all pathologies at Libben have not yet been published.

Demography
Demographic characteristics at Crestmont are compared with those of the Witte Group 2 to
determine if these data are as similar as other aspects of the sites. Statistics from the Harris
County Boys' School and the Peikert site are used as a beginning in detecting demographic
differences in groups separated by time and/or space. The Libben site is used as a prehistoric
demographic model. Any percentage totals greater or less than 100 are the result of rounding
to the nearest tenth of one percent.
Data limitations are made clear in Table 4. The male-to-female ratio, normally about 1:1, is
about 1:0.75 at Crestmont. In a sample of this size, the five adults for whom sex could not be
determined have no doubt biased this statistic. More, and worse, problems lie in the dearth of
individuals under the age of six, the necessity of large age categories, and truncation of the
older individuals into the over 35 category. Life tables .based on the distribution are therefore
somewhat limited and biased. Nevertheless, such a table was constructed. The resultant life
expectancy at birth is 23.7 years; crude mortality rate is 42.19 per 1000 (4.22 per 100)
population per annum. The life expectancy is too high; the mortality rate is then too low, since
it is calculated simply by dividing 1.00 by life expectancy at birth.

In order to make the Crestmont subadult age group more easily compared with those of the
other sites, the 16 - 25 age group has been split in Tables 5 and 6. There are two individuals
in that category; one is obviously less than 20 years old but the other has been moved
arbitrarily to the 21 - 35 age category.
The relatively minor differences in age distribution between the Crestmont and Witte Group 2
populations can be attributed to unequal sample size. The single category in which there might
be a real difference, age 11 - 20, where Crestmont more closely approaches Libben, is not
presently taken as significant. However, if another cemetery population should be identified as
closely related to these two, particular attention should be paid to this statistic.

*No mdiv1duals were over 40 years old.
NOTE: Data limitations have resulted in inconsistent age categories.

Individuals in the first category, age 0 - 5, are better represented at the Boys' School and
Peikert sites than at Crestmont or Witte. The frequency would perhaps be even greater at the
Boys' School if the age intervals had been equal. It would make no difference in the Peikert
sample; the single individual in the age 2 - 10 category was 7 or 8 years old. At Crestmont and
the Harris County Boys' School, two samples of equal size, infant burials are almost four
times more frequent at the latter than at the former, despite the unequal interval. Also, the
infant population at the Boys' School is almost double that of the first age category at Witte. It
is immediately clear, however, that none of the Texas sites approach the Libben site in this
category. These differences are discussed below. In all other categories, the Texas sites
compare reasonably well with the model population if we take into account their probable
seasonal use versus the perennial occupation at Libben and/or sample size and age inteivals.

36 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
Since many of the adults could not be aged, the categories are changed in Table 6 to "Adult"
and "Subadult" to better compare the populations. Hypothetical censuses are added to estimate
the numbers of burials necessary at the Texas sites to match the model.

*HYJX?thesized numbers and percentages are listed in parentheses.

Again, the actual percentage figures at the Texas sites are similar but hypothesizing the
approximate 60/40 split between subadults and adults of the model population gives a better
understanding of the possible magnitude of the bias in these samples.
Underrepresentation of very young individuals is not a new problem in Texas bioarcheology.
It is usually attributed to either skewed samples due to undetected burials or poor bone
preservation, or to the assumption that prehistoric groups did not regularly bury infants and
small children. Lovejoy et al. (1977:291-293) feel that the Libben site has provided a realistic
model of a prehistoric population. Still, infant mortality in these Texas samples does not
approach that of the later "robust, successful" population of Ohio.
The state of bone preservation at Libben was excellent. At the Texas sites, preservation was
fair rather than very poor but we must assume that at least some infant/child burials had been
completely destroyed before excavation began.
Undiscovered burials may be another factor, particularly at the Crestmont site. Although much
of the area was tested, there may have been several more burials. Figure 2 shows how the
cemetery appears to continue under the houses, and it was not possible to determine site extent
in this direction. Feature 22, shown extending under the house at the north (Fig. 2, upper left
comer), is an individual possibly as young as 11 - 13. The tali were the only complete bones
and were fairly comparable to those of Feature 36 (age 13 - 14.5). Five of the six juvenile
burials were found within a 3x6 m area (Features 24, 31, 33, 35, 36, Fig. 2). An undiscovered similar concentration of juveniles could have changed the statistics considerably. The age
distribution at Crestmont is very similar, however, to that of the Witte Group 2 (Table 6) where
about 89 percent of the cemetery was excavated (adapted from Hall 1981 :58). Eighty-five to
90 percent of the Libben site was excavated (Lovejoy et al. 1977:291), making the sampling
comparable to that at the Witte site.
To match the Libben sample, these hypothesized censuses represent five-fold increases at the
Crestmont and Witte sites and almost four-fold increases at the Peikert and Boys' School sites.
If, in order to match most anthropological populations, the Libben sample of subadults would
have had to be about 987 (rather than the actual count of 762), corresponding numbers of
undetected, destroyed, or absent burials at the Texas sites would reach astronomical figures.
The Libben sample, then, is accepted as a realistic model with which to compare these of
Texas, recognizing at the same time that the model is from a later sedentary and distant
population. That perhaps as many as 80 percent of expected infant mortalities are not
represented at the Late Archaic Crestmont and Witte Group 2 sites is taken as a starting point.

ANALYSIS AND SITE COMPARISONS / 37

Underrepresentation of the youngest individuals at these Texas sites due to skewed samples is
granted, but only to a point. Sampling at the Witte site is comparable to that at Libben; 254
undiscovered Group 2 burials is not considered a valid possiblity, nor does it seem reasonable
to accept that 80 percent were totally destroyed. It seems more likely that (1) the youngest
members of the group were seldom interred, (2) perennial versus occasional use is being
reflected, and (3) the Late Archaic birth rate may have been somewhat lower for these Texas
people than those of the Woodland model.
The lack of burials of the youngest individuals results in an elevated life expectancy at birth and
interferes with other calculations that are based on this figure. Life tables were constructed for
both the Crestmont and Witte Group 2, based on the actual (Table 5) and hypothetical distributions (summarized in Table 6) in an effort to establish parameters. Note that the necessarily
broader age categories at Crestmont lower this statistic. Resultant life expectancies at birth
were:
Crestmont:
Witte Group 2:

23.71 years (actual); 17.44 (hypothetical)
31.98 years (actual); 18.68 (hypothetical)

Life expectancy at birth at the Libben site was 19.88 years. With infants and very young children so poorly represented at these two Texas sites, perhaps it is more useful to say that if one
survived to age six, life expectancy was then at least 19 years at Crestmont and about 29 years
at Witte, as projected in the life tables based on the actual skeletal samples. Certainly, that is a
more accurate assessment.
Both the actual and hypothetical crude mortality rates were calculated from these life
expectancies. These are:
42.2 per 1000 per annum (actual)
57.3 per 1000 per annum (hypothetical)
Witte Group 2: 31.3 per 1000 per annum (actual)
53.5 per 1000 per annum (hypothetical)
Crestmont:

The true life expectancies and death rates for both sites, as usual, probably lie somewhere in
the middle, but we have at least established reasonable parameters.

Stature
Stature could be estimated for eight of the 11 adult males and for three of the nine adult females. Trotter and Gleser's formula for Mongoloid males was applied to both sexes and the
formula for white females applied to the estimates of female bones.
Few long bones were intact. In cases where one or more was nearly undamaged, maximum
length was estimated. These are indicated in Table 7 by an asterisk and should be fairly
accurate. For example, the right tibia of Feature 37 was complete but the right femur was
estimated. The resulting stature for this individual was 172.27Â±3.28 cm based on the intact
tibia and 171.68Â±3.80 cm based on the estimated length of the femur. Estimates from the long
bones of the leg are more reliable than those from the arm (Krogman 1962:185).
No subadults are included in Table 7. Long bone length could be estimated in only three of the
children and two of these were very rough estimates.
Three individuals, Features 5, 15, and 47, were more gracile and not so tall as the majority of
the group; at least two of these are believed to be female. Stature was undeterminable for all
three and the resulting mean female stature below is slightly high. With these exceptions, there

38 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
was little sexual dimorphism in this group-females were usually as robust and well-muscled
as males.

Dentition
The dental attrition rate is very high among the Crestmont population. It appears that both
heavy calculus accumulations and rapid wear of the occlusal surfaces with resultant exposure
of pulp cavities have contributed to aveolar abscessing and antemortem tooth loss. Hypoplasias
could be measured only in the youngest individuals. By around age 20, attrition had destroyed
any that might have been present. The shovel-shape of the incisors can be observed in only the
younger individuals. The incidence of tooth fracture is high but there are relatively few caries.
Wear of the molars was scored following Scott's (1979) method by which each tooth is visually quartered and attrition on each quadrant rated on a scale of 1 through 10. A score of zero
indicates no information (i.e., antemortem loss, postmortem loss, unerupted). A score of 1 is
assigned when wear facets are invisible or very small. The assigned value increases with flattening of the cusps and dentin exposure until a score of 10 indicates that no enamel is left on

ANALYSIS AND SITE COMPARISONS / 39

any part of the quadrant and wear extends below the cervicoenamel junction into the root.
Scores then range from 1to40 for each single molar.
Attrition at Crestmont is summarized below. While Scott's method of quantifying wear has
been followed, the "no information" category (zero score) is broken down in order to describe
attrition more precisely. Individually unique patterns noted in the description of skeletons section are not included. Because there is little comparative data, Tables 9 through 12 are intended
to provide raw data as well as to accurately describe the dentitions of the Crestmont group.

Pathologies
Twenty-one of the 31 individuals (68 percent) at Crestmont are affected by pathologies
detectable in the skeleton. Of these, six suffered from only degenerative arthritis although 11
(35 percent) skeletons exhibited this condition. There are two cases of fracture (6 percent), one
dart point wound (3 percent), one case of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, five of chronic
osteomyelitis (total of 19 percent), and nine cases of porotic hyperostosis (32 percent).
Parts of a few skeletons and portions of some bones suspected of exhibiting pathology were
not observable (i.e., the eroded skull of Feature 41). These are not described or included in
summaries.
Table 13 lists the Crestmont individuals from youngest to oldest and notes the kind of pathology, if any. The dental seriation begins with Feature A and continues through Feature 49. The
seriation does not necessarily accurately reflect an exact ordering by age. Food preferences,
malocclusions, and genetic inheritance will have been factors in attrition. Ages of the individuals Features 15 through 44B are unknown; a best guess is offered for a few.
Trauma
The most dramatic instance of trauma is the dart point driven into the upper arm of Feature 37,
an adult male (Fig. 6). The absence of signs of infection or healing around the wound indicates that death followed shortly. The size of the wound (postmortem damage considered) indicates a sufficient cause of death from traumatic shock. In addition, there may have been a
second wound which damaged vital organs in the chest cavity and/or a third wound in the
lower abdomen (see Descriptions of Skeletons, Feature 37).
The two bone fractures, in Features 6 and 39, are well healed but, because they were displaced
and healed without realignment, appear as irregularly thickened parts of the bones. Either

falling or a falling heavy object could have caused the fractured metatarsal of Feature 39. The
forearms are usually the site of parry fracture(s) but are also commonly the result of a fall
(Ortner and Putschar 1981:57). In Feature 6, where the right radius was fractured at midshaft, the right clavicle and humerus are visibly larger and slightly more heavily muscle-marked

ANALYSIS AND SITE COMPARISONS / 41

than the left. The right radius and ulna are the same as the left. This misaligned bone probably
reduced the range of motion, increasing stress on the upper arm and shoulder and resulting in
hypertrophy.
Infectious Disease
There are one acute and five chronic (19 percent of the population) cases in the Crestmont
bone-two forms of pyogenic osteomyelitis, a pus-forming inflammation of the bone and bone
marrow.
According to Steinbock (1976:60), woven bone, cortical thickening, supperating lesions, periostitis and osteomyelitis usually occur in combination, to a greater or lesser degree, and can
be correctly included under the single term, pyogenic osteomyelitis. This kind of nonspecific
infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus in almost 90 percent of cases (Steinbock
1976:60). The primary focus may be a furuncle, skin lesion or a subcutaneous abscess, or the
bone may become directly infected following a compound fracture or burn. Eighty to 90 percent of the acute cases are under 15 years of age and "Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is rare
among adults who are more likely to have the chronic form of infection" (Steinbock 1976:61).
The morphological changes, which range from slight to gross in all but one instance, suggest
chronic infections, rather than acute. It should be restated that only one of the six skulls is
absent and only the postcranial bones are involved in the remaining five.
The extreme, widespread periosteal reactive bone and lesions in Feature 32 are characteristic of
systemic infection. It was certainly the direct cause of death. It most resembles disseminated,
or acute, hematogenous osteomyelitis illustrated and described in Ortner and Putschar
(1981:123, Figs. 166-168, p. 122) and in Steinbock (1976:61-64). This is a 6 to 6.5 year old
whose teeth reflect nutritional stress, either direct or due to infectious disease, from age 2. The
bones, however, are only in the process of remodeling, with masses of reactive (loosely
laminated) bone present in some areas but little, if any, distortion anywhere by completely
calcified bone. Bone response is rapid in healthy children; a fracture can be healed and
undetectable in six weeks. The infection began or became rampant in this undernourished child
only a short time before death, perhaps one or two months at most (see Steinbock 1976:20).
The oldest site of infection appears to have been in the left tibia, where slight remodeling of the
proximal anterior crest is not yet quite complete.
In chronic cases, the amount of woven bone present is not as massive or widespread as in
Feature 32. Remodeling was taking place much more slowly, probably at least partially due to
the relatively better general health of the individuals exhibiting the chronic form of the infection. Woven bone is present in single, thin layers on the original cortex or overlying unknown
numbers of earlier layers that have matured. Additionally, some of the lesions appear to have
been healing while others in the same individual were active at death. This infection is not very
likely to have been the cause of death for Features 31, 36, A, 9, and 43, although varying degrees of periostitis and morphological changes were observed in each.

All members of the group were probably about equally exposed to the infection. In those
individuals who were infected only occasionally, the body's natural healing processes would
have erased all evidence of infection fairly quickly. No evidence of that kind of brief episode,
either just beginning or ending, was seen in any adult individual but the possibility cannot be
ruled out. The chronic infection in the three subadults might have been overcome had they
lived longer. However, when these five are viewed as a group to themselves, the degree of
infectious involvement increases with the age of the individual.

Feature 31 (age 13) exhibits very mild involvement. This is an incomplete and fragmented
skeleton, but of those bones observable, only the right femur and left humerus are affected.
There are two lesions, one active and the other healing.
Feature 36 (age 13 -14.5) is a nearly complete skeleton. Only two bones are involved, the left
femur and right tibia. There is a greater number of active lesions (four) and there is more
woven bone than in Feature 31 but no cortical thickening has occurred.
In Feature A (age 15 - 17), the humeri and femora are affected. There is a significant increase
in the size and severity of the lesions, rather than in number, over those seen in Feature 36, and
cortical thickening has occurred in the left femur. The tibiae and fibulae are absent.

ANALYSIS AND SITE COMPARISONS / 43

The remaining two cases, Features 9 (age >35) and 43 (age unknown), are indisputably
chronic and long-term (Fig. 7). Although partial tibiae were virtually all that was recovered
from Feature 43, they are comparable to the tibiae of Feature 9.
This suggests that, whether or not all individuals of the group were occasionally affected, the
chronic form of the disease tended to become established in some individuals early in
adolescence and to continue throughout the individual's lifetime. It was probably not disabling
but was likely debilitating when cortical thickening was well advanced.
Comparisons of pathology rates are complicated by differing diagnoses or terminology among
those doing the analyses. The term "chronic osteomyelitis" is given in this report to the same
condition called "swelling and cortical thickening" by Malina and Bramblett (1981:334-346)
and is differentiated from osteomyelitis. The chronic infectious disease described as present at
Crestmont and in Witte Group 2 is the same as at the Boys' School and the Peikert sites. All
are counted in the osteomyelitis category in Table 14 where major diseases are listed.
Four adult males, three adult females, one child (age 7 - 8), and one infant (age 0 -2) were
identified and studied at Peikert (Copas 1984). An additional adult male and an infant were
recovered, but their remains were either too fragmentary or were lost prior to analysis and they
are not included in these pathology comparisons.
Evidence of at least one pathology was found in the skeletons of all nine individuals available
for study. There were four instances of dental disease (three were aveolar abscesses), two of
fracture, one (probably three) died of a dart point wound, and osteomyelitis affected six, possibly seven (66.7 to 77.8 percent of the population). Descriptions of osteomyelitis in three individuals indicate the same long-standing, chronic infections as at Crestmont. The infant case
is acute hematogenous osteomyelitis, and the remainder appear to be chronic becoming acute.

This 100 percent pathology rate suggests a special-use burying ground, a brief and/or episodic
period of development of the site, or a group in severe stress-perhaps all three. In any case,
it is not consistent with the Crestmont and Witte Group 2 cemeteries. At Crestmont, as among
Witte's Group 2 burials, victims of infectious disease were generally mingled with the others,
with headward orientation more varied than at Peikert.
The high rate of pathology at the Leonard K site (41AU37, Allens Creek) led analysts to suggest that it was a special burial ground for victims of infectious disease (Malina and Bramblett
1981 :340). A brief or episodic development is not suggested in Hall's (1981: 108-113) discussion of the cultural contexts of five recovered burials. unly one each was positively identified as contemporaneous with Groups 2 and 3, with three possibly of the same time period as
either Group 1 or 2. Six individuals were counted in the laboratory: two with arthritis, two

44 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
with extensive ulcerous lesions, and two with both. At 41AU36, Group 2 burials alone included 78 cases of arthritis, 13 of ulcerous lesions, plus 14 of chronic osteomyelitis. Thus the
Leonard K site does not appear to have been a special burial ground for any of the three groups
and its nature is clearly quite different from that of the Peikert site.
Fourteen cases of cortical thickening/periosteal swelling (chronic osteomyelitis) were noted at
the Witte site (Malina and Bramblett 1981:385-386). Ten of these were from Group 2: one
adolescent (age 12-20), three young adults (age 20- 35), one adolescent or young adult, two
middle adults (age 35 - 50), one old adult (age >50) and two adults of undetermined age
(totaling 4 percent of the Group 2 population). The individuals are not ranked by severity of
involvement.
It appears that the incidence of chronic osteomyelitis is associated with (or at least increases
with) the later burials at both Crestmont and Witte. At Crestmont, headward orientation is
known for four of the six affected individuals: three toward the north-northeast and one to the
south-southwest (one of the deviant orientations). Headward orientation was determined for
seven of the ten in Group 2: six to the north-northeast and one to the north-northwest (all
within the arc 335 to 31 degrees).
The ulcerous lesions seen in the bones of the Witte site (Malina and Bramblett 1981:344; Fig.
I-2, p. 341; Table 1-16, p. 343; Table 11-10, pps. 385-386) were not found at Crestmont.
Nine Group 2 skeletons exhibiting these lesions can be identified in Table 11-10. Five of these
are oriented at 55 degrees or less; orientation for four is undetermined. This pathology may be
a late-developing one for Group 2 and further evidence that use of the Crestmont cemetery
ended before that of the Witte.
Porotic Hyperostosis
Porotic hyperostosis is a nonspecific consequence of bone marrow proliferation-the body's
attempt to produce more red blood cells. Generally, the more severe the involvement, the more
symmetrical and "spongy" is its manifestation in the ectocranium. The most common causes
are the anemias: congenital hemolytic anemia (i.e., thalassemia, sickle cell disease) and iron-deficiency anemia (Steinbock 1976:219). The most probable cause of this disorder among
prehistoric and early historic American Indians is iron-deficiency anemia (Steinbock 1976:236;
Mensforth et al. 1978:7). Iron-deficiency anemia rarely affects the postcranial bones
(Steinbock 1976:231). Deficiency, however, is not always due to a simple lack of iron in the
available diet. Other factors are the " .. .inability to absorb iron from the intestine, excessive
losses of iron from the body, ...disturbances of iron metabolism by infection or other mechanisms ... [and] chronic deficiencies of amino acids and minerals necessary for bone formation"
(Steinbock 1976:231). Infections of the intestines (protozoa!, helminthic, and/or bacterial) can
prevent adequate iron absorption and cause chronic blood loss, and cooking methods can destroy folic acid and vitamin B12 necessary for normal development of red blood cells. A lack
of ascorbic acid, an aid to iron absorption, can contribute; even excessive sweating increases
iron loss.
The cranial bones of nine individuals (29 percent) at Crestmont evidence porotic hyperostosis;
the postcranials are not affected. The site does not lie in an area of known congenital anemia.
The condition, then, is probably due to iron-deficiency anemia. Overall, this pathology at
Crestmont is mild and the pattern asymmetrical; it does not approach the spongy appearance or
symmetry of Hrdlicka's "symmetrical osteoporosis" (c.f. Steinbock 1976:214, Fig. 82). In
general, pitting of the ectocranium is centered around bregma, extends posteriorly on the
parietals avoiding the sagittal suture and does not continue onto the occipital, although the
occipital was affected in two instances (Features A and 5). Expansion of the diploe is irregular
and does not necessarily follow the pitting. In most cases at least a small portion of the orbital

ANALYSIS AND SITE COMPARISONS / 45

roof was still attached to the frontal bone. These and other orbital bone fragments were
inspected for the presence of lesions (see Mensforth et al. 1978:27) but only one instance was
observed (Feature 4).
Since 71 percent of the population did not have the disorder, we assume an adequate supply of
iron was available in the group's diet-probably meat, which contains iron in an already
absorbable form not requiring processing by the body-and consider other factors which might
have been involved. One contributor is seen in four or five of the nine affected individuals.
In Table 15, these individuals are compared with each other and ranked by degree of involvement, from mildest (1) to most severe (9), and possible contributing factors noted.
The high degree of dental attrition alone is an insufficient explanation for iron deficiency in the
older individuals. Features 8, 5, and 39 were not ranked as the oldest but only among the
oldest of a group which was aged largely on the basis of dental attrition. Further, Feature 9, a
female (age >35) who had lost all maxillary molars and premolars long before her death,
showed a long-term chronic osteomyelitis but no evidence ofporotic hyperostosis.
The chronic osteomyelitis in Feature A may have been a factor in this subadult being the most
severely deficient. Comparing this skeleton with that of Feature 9, however, strongly suggests
that at least one more factor was involved.
For Feature 6, the aveolar abscess is a questionable contributing factor to iron deficiency. The
abscess is healed, the adjacent teeth are dead, and the exquisite pain associated with dental
abscesses should have ceased. It is possible that the deficiency began with the dental problem

and was in the process of resolution at the time of death. Considering the other cases, however, this is most likely an over-simplification.
No evidence of other disease could be detected in the skeletons of Features 42, 4, 44A, and B.
That iron deficiency is found not merely among the youngest but in all the youngest adults
(Table 13) is probably significant. We would expect any of the other contributors to anemia,
even internal parasites, to be spread fairly evenly throughout the population, thus evening out
the occurrence of porotic hyperostosis. The defects in the permanent tooth enamel of the
subadults are concrete evidence of nutritional stress beginning around age 2, yet only one of
these (Feature A, who was approaching adulthood and had chronic osteomyelitis) was iron deficient. One or more of the many infectious diseases affecting only the body's soft tissues are

46 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
likely contributing factor(s) to the iron deficiency in the young adults at Crestmont, but since
this appears to be largely an age-specific condition here, cultural factors may have been at work
also. That it is possibly also sex-specific cannot be determined because only one, possibly
two, of the total of six young adults is female. In any case, anemia was not severe enough in
any individual to have been the primary cause of death.
Porotic hyperostosis was not reported present at the Witte site. Preparations for this report,
however, included inspecting a few of the skulls of Group 2 for the condition, since it is
sometimes hard to differentiate between it and simple postmortem erosion of the bone and lesions indicating iron deficiency. Bones representing 30 skulls were inspected, 27 of which
were associated with Group 2. Four of the 27 exhibited relatively mild, but definite, asymmetrical porotic hyperostosis: Burials #16 (young adult male), #27 (old adult male), #24 (adult,
sex undetermined), #38 (middle adult male). This pathology is evenly distributed through age
groups, but, as only males were definitely identified as having this condition at Witte, it brings
up the question of sex-related distribution in the Group 2 population.

Burial Practices
Head orientation and body positions are taken directly from the Crestmont site map (Fig. 2)
and are compared with the compass readings recorded for the burials at the Ernest Witte site.
Data on burial inclusions at Crestmont are compiled from T ARL photographs and from some
grave goods that were found during cleaning of the bones.

The chert flakes found with Features 18, 39, and 41 are not considered deliberate inclusions.
The unworked animal bones found with Features 9, 25, 31, and 43 are not known to have
been included deliberately but are described below. Of the seven burials with flakes and
unworked bone associated, only Feature 18 was without any other kind of artifact. Among the
67.7 percent of the burials containing grave goods are three in which red ocher was the only
inclusion (Features 25, 32, and 33). Seven burials were either disturbed or incompletely

ANALYSIS AND SITE COMPARISONS / 47

excavated (Features 15, 22, 14, 33, 35, 43, 44B). Five of these are included in the "Absent"
category although they might legitimately have been placed in the "Undetermined." Feature C,
lacking anifacts found in the soil clinging to the bones as did Features A and B, is placed in the
"Undetermined" category.
By far the predominant headward orientation is in the north-to-east arc (0 to 90 degrees).
Placement of the body in the extended, supine position is consistent throughout this arc except
for those burials oriented due north. There, in Features 5 and 49, we see the only possibly
semiflexed and flexed burials among the group.
Only three burials for which orientation could be determined deviate from the norm and then
only in headward orientation. Features 6, 36, and 42 are oriented in the west-to-south arc, in
direct opposition to the majority. All are extended burials and all have associated grave
goods-worked bone with Features 6 and 36, shell with Feature 42. One is 13 - 14.5 years
old, one 25 - 35, the other less than 25. All are believed to be male. One was afflicted with
chronic osteomyelitis and two with porotic hyperostosis. There were, however, several
others, male and female, who suffered the same diseases and with similar associated grave
goods. There is no discernible pattern in these burials in the presence or absence of grave
goods, kinds of grave goods, or pathologies. There are two common factors: the age at death
(less than 35) and the sex (male).
Five of the six individuals under age 15 were buried in an area approximately 3x6 m (Fig. 2,
Features 24, 31, 33, 35, and 36). The sixth, Feature 32, was buried 5 m north of the outer
edge of this concentration. Feature 32 was the six-year-old who died of disseminated
hematogenous osteomyelitis. The placement of these burials may indicate only that the five
died within a fairly brief time period, or it may have been a deliberate attempt to separate this
child from those whose deaths were less violent and/or more understandable. The juvenile
burials are not entirely separate, however. Four adults were placed very near them, but with
differing headward orientations. One older adult (Feature 39) is found in their midst; whether
or not this is an intrusive burial cannot be determined from the site map, although most of the
lower extremities of Feature 31 are absent. It appears that grouping juvenile burials was a
practice at the Crestmont site.
There is very slight evidence of another practice at Crestmont, not yet proven but which should
be noted. Disease may have been acknowledged occasionally by including as grave goods
animal bone or parts comparable to the affected human bone. When the bones were taken from
the field bags and cleaned in the laboratory, unworked animal bones were found with a few of
the features-9, 25, 31, and 43.
A partial right deer (juvenile) maxilla containing the second and third premolars was found with
Feature 25, the individual with the large healed abscess which tunneled through the right
maxilla at the root of the second premolar. A second deer bone, a phalanx, was found in the
field bag containing the bones of the right hand. A proximal deer tibia was found with the leg
bones of Feature 43, one of two individuals whose heavy, distorted tibae evidenced very longstanding chronic osteomyelitis. The second individual who suffered severe, long-term chronic
osteomyelitis (and, probably, arthritis) was Feature 9. A slightly burned deer lumbar vertebra
(juvenile) was found among these vertebral and pelvic fragments. A deer phalanx and distal
fibula were found with Feature 31 in whom mild osteomyelitis was observed in the proximal
right femur and left humerus. The long bones of the lower legs of Feature 31 are absent.
All of these may be merely chance inclusions but, in two of the four cases, the choice of animal
bones is peculiarly appropriate. That the choices in the other instances were just as appropriate
may not be indicated by skeletal evidence alone. Animal parts may have been included as food

48 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
offerings, but as such, they seem parsimonious--only token--offerings. There is virtually no
edible meat on a deer maxilla, phalanx, or tibia.
There were, apparently, no multiple burials, and no bundle or cremated burials at the site.
At Crestmont, then, all interments were primary and single, most commonly with the body
extended, supine, and the head oriented within the north-to-east arc. Headward orientation in
the opposite direction was a rather rare but not punitive practice, nor do those burials seem to
have been done with more honor. Grave goods were included with most burials and were
usually personal ornaments (see artifact descriptions and listings, Appendices A and B).
Inclusions of deer bone(s) may have been related to a recognized disease in the individual.
There was a designated area (areas?) for juvenile burials.
Comparisons with Witte Group 2
In Figure 2, the site map, headward orientations at Crestmont are at times probably aproximate,

but there are 24 burials for which it seemed clear. Data for the Witte site are adapted from Hall
(1981:83, 272, 283, 368-377) and include only the number for which orientation could be
determined. Numbers, rather than percentages, are given in Figure 8 in order to avoid
confusion. These represent 77.4 percent of the burials at Crestmont and 60.7 percent of those
in the Witte Group 2. Headward orientation of the burials from which the Witte radiocarbon
dates were obtained are noted.

Headward Orientation and Body Position in Crestmont and Witte Group 2

Burials.

Twelve Group 2 burials oriented toward the northwest (335 to 360 degrees) intruded into
others oriented toward the predominant northeast arc, indicating that orientation preference
swung to the north during the later part of Group 2 burial activity (Hall 1981:272). The two
radiocarbon dates obtained from Group 1 (2610 B.C. and 1510 B.C.) strongly indicate that
this trend was underway in that group, also. Group 3, where the primary headward orientation
is in the north-northwest sector (310 to 10 degrees) is tentatively dated at A.D. 550-950 (Hall
1981:53). Studying the headward orientation diagrams (Hall 1981:283, Fig. 53), orientation

ANALYSIS AND SITE COMPARISONS / 49

preference in Groups 1, 2, and 3 burials appears to progress, however uneven it may have
been, around the compass from southwest (190 degrees) to northwest (330 degrees), with
activity for Group 1 falling between 190 to 110 degrees, for Group 2 between 120 and about
350 degrees, and from 10 to 310 degrees for Group 3. The overlapping that occurs between
these three groups promotes a sense of continuity through a time span of over 3500 years. The
reversal seen in Group 4 burials, dated at A.D. 900-1400, appears to represent a major change
in tradition, a new group, or a time gap between Groups 3 and 4.
A very definite trend in body position, from extended (earlier) to flexed (later) follows this
headward orientation at the Witte site (see Hall 1981:380, Table II-6) and seems to have at
Crestmont, also. Feature 5, oriented toward the north-northeast, appears to have been semiflexed; Feature 49, oriented almost due north and placed well away from all other burials, is
flexed (Fig. 2).
Definite alternating periods of higher burial activity are indicated at these sites. The majority of
burials at Crestmont are oriented toward the east-northeast; the majority at Witte, to the northnortheast.
As seen in Figure 8a, 21 burials (87.5 percent of known orientations) at Crestmont are oriented
within the north-to-east arc. Bisecting the northeast sector at 45 degrees, 12 to 16 (50 - 67
percent) are oriented toward the east-northeast, and 5 - 9 burials (21 - 38 percent) toward the
north-northeast. At the Witte site, 63 burials (71.5 percent of the known orientations, Table 6)
are oriented toward the northeast (Fig. 8b). When the northeast arc is bisected at 45 degrees,
25 burials (28 percent) are seen oriented east-northeast and 38 (43 percent) toward the northnortheast.
The percentage of deviant burials is virtually the same at both sites: 10 percent at Crestmont and
seven percent at Witte. Hall (1981 :272) mentions 10 burials radically departing from the
preferred headward orientation of Group 2, of whom nine were female. Unable to reconcile
this division by sex among the orientation extremes, the data below are from 14 burials (16a,
22, 27, 37, 64, 65, 75, 139, 174, 177, 185, 193, 208, 226) from which these ten are
obviously drawn. Hall also mentions eight individuals placed face-down in the burial pit,
seven of whom were female (Hall 1981 :272, 406). Only two of these show up in the
summary below. There were no face-down burials at Crestmont

As at Crestmont, there appears to be no discernible pattern in the Witte Group 2 deviant burials
except in age and sex. Ten of the fourteen above are female (Hall designated nine of 10) and at
least eight of the 14 are less than 35 years old.
In the deviant burials at both sites there is a predominant, although opposing, sex, a tendency
to include the younger individuals, and an obvious lack of pattern in body position, distribution
or kind of grave goods, and in pathological involvements. As a sub-group, they appear no
more or less honored or outcast, and no more or less ill, than the group as a whole. They do
not include all the younger members, male or female, nor even the very youngest individuals.
There were no secondary burials at Crestmont. There were five (3 percent) among Group 2,
three cremated and two bundle burials, but no indication of whether or not any of these resulted
from deaths occurring away from the site (Hall 1981:85-86).
While higher burial activity at Crestmont was during the earlier years and during the later at
Witte, only the Witte site appears to have been used with any frequency, averaging one burial
in 4 to 6 years. At Crestmont, the average is one in about 28 years. Deaths by violence are
seen as a possible explanation.
Feature 37, the single individual at Crestmont (3 percent) who died of a dart point wound, was
buried with the head to the northeast. Of five violent deaths (2 - 3 percent) among the Witte
Group 2, four are oriented generally toward the north-northeast. A young adult female, oriented toward the east-southeast, may be the fifth. If we accept that headward orientation of
burials progressed from east to north, it appears that intergroup conflict began only after
Crestmont was well established and that the violent death occurred fairly early in the later, less
active period of the site's use. Most of the violent deaths at the Witte site appear to have occurred in the very last years of Group 2 utilization, although burial activity may have remained
high.
Comparisons with the Peikert Site
Burial practices at the Peikert site (Table 4) differ from those at Crestmont and Witte.
Predominant headward orientation (generally south), body position (semiflexed), and the brief
or special use development added to demographic and pathologic statistics exclude the Peikert
group from association with Crestmont and Group 2. Evidence of intergroup conflict and the
high rate of disease appear to place Peikert in the time frame of the later years of Crestmont and
Witte Group 2. The proximity of the sites, particularly Crestmont and Peikert, suggests that
contact between the groups was almost inevitable if they were in any part contemporary.
Violent death is evident at Peikert; at least one individual died from a dart point wound. Since
two more individuals were included with this one in a multiple burial, it is probable that they,
too, died violently and in the same conflict. The percentage of deaths by violence is much
higher here than at Crestmont and Witte-probably 36 percent
Comparisons with the Harris County Boys' School
Separated by both time and space, burial practices at the Boys' School in no way resemble
those at Crestmont. Burial activity here is believed to have occurred after A.D. 600, the period

ANALYSIS AND SITE COMPARISONS / 51

of Group 3 (A.D. 550-950) or Group 4 (A.D. 900-1400) at the Witte site, but there is no similarity to these groups except that burials were semiflexed or flexed. At the Witte site, Groups
3 and 4 were oriented to the northwest and southeast, respectively; at the Harris County Boys'
School, the bodies were usually placed in an east-west direction (average bearing of 85.9
degrees with a standard deviation of 44.6 degrees; Aten et al. 1976:60). The traditions or
preferences of the Boys' School group were not shared by, and seem not to have evolved
from, those at Witte and Crestmont.

Associated Artifacts
In addition to burial practices, demography, and pathology, there are other similarities between
the Crestmont cemetery and the Witte Group 2 which should be mentioned. There are also
some dissimilarities.
The few artifacts found with the human bones from Crestmont are described in Appendix A.
These, together with those shown in photographs on file at TARL, were compared with those
associated with the Witte Group 2 and many fall easily into Hall's categories. A shell pendant
found with Feature 41 is similar to the Witte Form 1, Specimen 3 (Hall 1981:195, Fig. 45).
Worked bone artifacts found with Features A and/or Band/or C, 6, 36, and 37 appear identical
to the Witte Pointed Bone Form 3 (Hall 1981:225, Fig. 50).
No ceramics were found directly associated with the Witte Group 2. There are no photographs
of ceramics from Crestmont and none were found among the human bones.
There are some differences between these two populations, mainly in the kinds of artifacts and
their association.
1) No Lithospermum seed beads were recovered with Witte Group 2. Those found at
Crestmont (Appendix A) were associated with Features A and 44A. Their absence from the
assemblage at 41AU36 does not preclude their presence at that site. Their size (1.5 - 3.0 mm)
and tendency to absorb soil color effectively hides them in matrix or even among clean bone
fragments. The eight beads associated with Feature A were not detected among the fragmented
facial bones until the third or fourth inspection of this skull.
2) At least six of the 11 boatstones recovered from the Witte site were associated with Group 2
burials (Hall 1981: 176-178). These are generally believed to date to the very late Late Archaic.
They are more common in north and east Texas than in south Texas (Hall 1981:176-178). No
boatstones were recovered from Crestmont.
3) There was one style of bone artifact (Fig. 9) at Crestmont that was not, apparently, at the
Witte site.
4) Several Crestmont burials (Features A, B, and/or C, 6, 20, 24, 31, 37, 41, and 42) had
associated beads made from shell columellae. There were none at the Witte site but some had
been collected by the landowner from 41AU38, the Little Bethlehem site.
5) No bone artifacts were associated with the Witte Group 2 burials of individuals less than 20
years of age (Hall 1981:244). Worked bone was associated with six burials at Crestmont, one
of whom was subadult (Feature 36, age 13 -14.5).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have gained several facts and inferences about the Crestmont people from the skeletal
materials. The average lifetime was fairly short; life expectancy at birth was, at best, about 24
years and at least 42 percent died by age 35. They were plagued with staph infections which
could become chronic and debilitating. The high nutritional needs of fast-growing young
children were not met and many of the adults showed skeletal evidence of malnutrition,
although whether this was due to dietary insufficiency or infectious disease is not established.
Despite this, as adults they were well-developed and muscular. There was little sexual
dimorphism; adult females (with possibly three exceptions) ranged from about 5'1" to 5'8" tall,
the males from 5'2" to 5'10". Some of their material goods were in the form of seed, shell,
and bone ornaments. They had definite but changing traditions in disposing of their dead:
customary positioning of the body and headward orientation, with a culturally dictated reason
for occasionally deviating from the customary orientation; inclusion of material goods with the
body; and grouping of juvenile burials. Expected deaths of individuals under age 6 are not
confirmed by skeletal remains. Their stays at, or near, Crestmont were probably brief, perhaps
no more than a few days, and may not have been annual, but the site was a specified place for
burials for many years.
The people buried at the Crestmont cemetery were closely related to the people of Group 2 at
the Ernest Witte site. Burial practices, demography, pathology, and what is known of the
artifact assemblage are very similar. The time span for Group 2 is proposed as 520 B.C. to
A.D. 360. Taking the chipped stone artifacts into account, Hall (1981:49-53) felt that the
radiocarbon date A.D. 360 Â± 80 (TX-2452) was more representative of the group as a whole.
This is also the approximate time span indicated for the Crestmont site, but it is expected that an
undetermined date earlier than A.D. 360 is probably more representative of these burials. By
far, the majority of Crestmont burials are related to only Group 2. None resemble those of
Witte Groups 1, 3, or 4 except Feature 49, which possibly could be associated with the
Transitional Group 3.
Our view of the Late Archaic groups is that of nomadic hunter-gatherers who followed
seasonal rounds in search of food and for social exchange. Both the Witte Group 2 and
Crestmont populations illustrate how highly irregular these rounds may have been. Witte
Group 2 burials average one every four years; at Crestmont, the average is one every 28 years.
The alternating periods of higher activity at these two sites may be an earlier manifestation of
the northeastward-retreating import/export sphere which "... reached the Allens Creek area
between A.D. 200 and A.D. 400, its passage marked by a shift in burial orientation, and by the
interment of at least five individuals who died violently" (Hall 1981:303). Only one individual
at Crestmont is known to have died violently; his death may have resulted in less frequent or
shorter stays near the site. Crestmont appears not to have been totally abandoned until about
the same time or shortly before the end of Group 2 at the Witte site. The reduction of activity at
Crestmont and the increase at Witte is seen as supporting a proposed single group responsible
for the burials at both sites. Whether or not they were is not yet established, but they are so
similar that no discussion of one is complete without including the other.
Among the burial practices at Allens Creek, the most striking is the apparently slow but
persistent change in preferred headward orientation, from south-southwest in the Witte Group
l, through east, north and north-northwest in Group 2, to north-northwest in Group 3. This
progression ends with the reversal to the southeast in Group 4. The majority of the Crestmont
burials are oriented to the east-northeast; the majority of the Group 2 burials to the northnortheast. This suggests higher rate of activity at Crestmont in the earlier part of the proposed
time period and a higher rate at the Witte site during the later part.

53

54 / THE CRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
No satisfactory explanation has been found for those burials where the head was oriented in a
direction directly opposing the majority. They are few in number-only three at Crestmont,
ten in Witte site Group 2. They do not share a pathology detectable in the skeleton. They were
not deprived of, nor more abundantly supplied with, grave goods than other burials. They
tend to be among the younger individuals and females are slightly predominant. Since age six
may have been significant in the funerary traditions of these people, the deviant burials might
also be associated with a specified number of years. For instance, it may have been customary
that individuals not born to the group (accepted from another) must have been with the group
for X number of years before they were entitled to share the currently accepted burial
orientation.
Along with the changing preferred headward orientation at the Witte site is the changing
predominant body arrangement from extended to semiflexed to flexed. In the Witte Group 2,
42 percent were extended and on the back. This is not the case at Crestmont. Of the 31 burials
there, only four (13 percent) are drawn to suggest slightly bent legs and these appear to have
rested primarily on the back. One more is shown to be definitely flexed. Together these
represent 16 percent of the burials, leaving 84 percent extended and on the back. This suggests
that utilization of the Crestmont site was discontinued before the semiflexed positioning of the
body was a very ordinary practice.
The lack of secondary burials at Crestmont and the few (3 percent) among Group 2 at Witte
indicate that interment was usually very near where the death occurred, and, although tentative,
we have some idea of the number expected to occur annually. (The number of interments
probably does not equal the number of deaths.) Based on the actual censuses, expected deaths
are 3.13 per 100 population for Group 2 and 4.22 per 100 for Crestmont. Using the larger
sample (Group 2) and reducing group size to a more conservative number of 50 (crude
mortality rate of 1.58 per group of 50), the 223 Witte Group 2 burials represent only 16
percent of 1390 expected to occur in the 880-year period. If the Crestmont population can
rightfully be added to Group 2, we still have only about 18 percent of the expected number of
deaths. There might be as many as 1,136 more burials-somewhere--created by this group
alone. On the other hand, at the same mortality rate, the total number of expected deaths in a
160-year period (the plus or minus 80 years of Tx-2452) is 253. The combined Crestmont and
Group 2 population lies somewhere between 176 and 254. The small Alben George
population could be included without disturbing the calculations. The conclusion to be drawn
from this hypothesis, however, is that this Late Archaic group utilized only three areas in 160
years of seasonal rounds. This is inconsistent with our present view of the Late Archaic.
Again, we have established parameters-18 to 100 percent recovery rate of expected burials.
Such a wide range is, in itself, of little value. But, if we have recovered all of the expected
burials, we are one step closer to working out a satisfactory explanation for the lack of
individuals under age six, and the roles of disease and violent death in the demise of the
Crestmont/Group 2 culture. If, however, we have recovered less than one-fifth of the expected
burials, we still have an assemblage of cultural traditions, demography, and pathology, as well
as material goods, by which to identify associated sites.
In both Crestmont and Group 2 populations, the number of children below the age of six years
is far below that of the model Late Woodland population at the Libben site. Excavation at the
Witte site is about equal to that at Libben and hence undetected or destroyed burials are not
believed to be the single reason for the difference of 39.8 percent at Libben and 3 - 7 percent
found at Crestmont and Witte, perhaps not even the major reason. Three more possiblilties
must be considered: perennial versus seasonal use, birth rates, and burial customs.
First, occasional rather than perennial use must be reflected in even large cemetery populations
such as Group 2. Seasonal use of a single cemetery, spanning even a great number of years,

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS / 55

might not accurately reflect the demography of the group who used it. Crestmont may
represent a faction of Group 2, which split up during periods of stress, and would, therefore,
contain a disproportionate number of individuals for whom the stress was greatest This might
explain why all of the young adults at Crestmont have a single pathology in common and why
the juvenile burials are found in a small area. By inference, we might expect that they created
at least one more cemetery which contained a high proportion of individuals under age six.
Second, birth rates are not constant. If the Crestmont/Group 2 way of life was being
threatened or curtailed by intergroup pressures, it could well have been accompanied by a
decreased birth rate. For example, there is some archeological evidence for fluctuations in
population at the end of the Late Archaic in central Texas (Prewitt 1985:216-225).
Third, there is the question of whether or not Crestmont/Group 2 infants and youngest children
were buried as regularly as adults, or in the same manner. The only approach to this question
will be through those individuals in this age category that are recovered-looking for
circumstances that resulted in such a burial.
The underrepresentation in the below-six age category at Crestmont and among Group 2 is
emphasized by higher percentages in that category at the Peikert and Harris County Boys'
School sites. At present, all three of the above factors are considered equal possibilities.
The high rate of pathology in addition to generalized arthritis and trauma found at Crestmont
gives us some insight into the quality of life. Two diseases, osteomyelitis and iron deficiency
anemia, affected 15 (>48 percent) of the population. Infectious osteomyelitis had to be recognized as a potential killer, particularly of children. At best, its chronic form was surely partially
debilitating, as witnessed by the hypertrophied long bones of the lower legs in two individuals.
Nutritional insufficiency, while not acute in any case, was probably even more significant to
the group as a whole. Six of the seven individuals between the ages of 15 and 35 were affected by this generally weakening condition. In this society, where age 40 was old, these
younger adults are likely to have been the work horses on whom fell much of the responsibility
for the group's safety, subsistence, economic welfare, and continuance. Their stamina and,
hence, efficiency, would have been reduced. These are the prime child-bearing years and anemic mothers produce anemic babies with lowered chances of survival. Nutritional deprivation
in infancy and early childhood witnessed by the hypoplastic defects in the tooth enamel of all
the subadults suggests that survival was chancy for every child born to the group.
Several questions about the Crestmont cemetery remain unanswered, most of them having to
do with the artifact assemblage. These concern the cemetery's time span and whether or not it
was an occupied site as well as a burial ground. Field observations of stratigraphy are totally
lacking for this report. Appendix B is a list of recovered artifacts and their associations compiled from photographs on file at TARL. It is probably incomplete but does give some idea of
the assemblage. Additionally, there are relationships that might be answered by field notes.
For example, Feature 37 was one of the best, if not the best, preserved skeletons of the sample
and also had more grave goods than any other burial. Is this an accident of preservation, a
fortuitous choice of grave site, or might this body have been prepared for burial in a way that
resulted in better preservation?
Although there are more similarities between Crestmont and Witte Group 2, there are some
important dissimilarities not to be overlooked. There are apparently three kinds of artifacts
recovered from Crestmont that were not at the Witte site: Busycon sp. columella shell beads,
Lithospermum sp. seed beads, and a particular form of incised bone ornament. These are
described and their associations noted in Appendix B. There was no worked bone associated
with a Group 2 individual less than 20 years old; at Crestmont there were four bone pins with
Feature 36 (age 13 -14.5).

56 / THECRESTMONT SITE, 41WH39
Beads made from Busycon sp. columellae, presumably from the Gulf of Mexico, appear to
have been found with several burials at Crestmont. They were not among the assemblage at
either the Witte (41AU36) or Leonard K (41AU37) sites at Allens Creek, but Hall interviewed
a landowner who had collected some from 41AU38 which, he said, were associated with
human bones (Hall 1981:115-116). The majority of the artifacts and a radiocarbon date
indicated Late Prehistoric occupation of the site. Although Hall speculated on a possible
indication and location of an Archaic component, none was definitely established (Hall
1981:120-121). Hall proposed these beads as "a valuable and potentially time-diagnostic
contrast between the forms of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric ornaments... " (Hall
1981: 128). The Crestmont assemblage appears to indicate that, instead, these artifacts belong
to the early part of the Late Archaic and perhaps are supporting evidence of an Archaic
component at 41AU38, the Little Bethlehem site.
The fragile but tenacious little Lithospermum seed beads (from a plant commonly called Puccoon) found at Crestmont might easily be undetected in the field, and even in the laboratory.
Nevertheless, many have been collected from a number of Texas sites. At 41AU1, 41BL3,
41CV14, 41CV7, 41BQ1, 41CU6, 41CE19, and 41LR2 (not a complete listing) they were,
with one possible exception, associated with burials, and, if provenience is known, they were
necklaces or in/on an object placed near the skulls. Reports from the University of Michigan
Ethnobotanical Laboratory between 1933 and 1941 identified samples from 41CU6, 41LR2,
and 41CV14 as made from the seeds of plants " .. .in the Boraginaceae [Borage] family,
Gromwell (Lithospermum sp.) or False Gromwell (Onosmodium sp.) ... they more likely are
Lithospermum" (TARL site files, 41LR2). Both species are found in much of the United
States and in parts of southern Canada. Beads made from the Onosmodium species have been
found with burials of the Ozark Bluff Dweller culture (Harrington 1960:31, 76) whose artifact
assemblage also included columella shell beads from Gulf shells (Harrington 1960:159). The
roots of the plant, thick and red, are known to have been used by the historic Chippewa as a
major ingredient in making red dye and face paint, and the seeds of one variety were used as a
love charm (Densmore 1928:275-397). At present it appears that these seed beads are an
ornamental artifact to be found in assemblages ranging from the Late Archaic to Early Caddoan
times (as at 41CE19) and in association with human burials.
One form of worked bone artifact (Fig. 9) found at Crestmont is unlike any from the Witte site.
In the photograph they appear to measure about 4 cm in length by about 2 cm in width. They
also seem to be slightly concave/convex as are the longer, pointed Forms 2 and 3 at Witte
which were made from longitudinally split deer metatarsals. The presumed proximal end,
however, displays side- or corner-notching reminiscent of stone projectile points and the distal
ends are cut straight, rather than pointed, and are possibly smoothed. Study of the entire
assemblage and a search for similar forms is needed to assess the importance of this style. It
may have been an anomalous, personal ornament; it might be a potential time diagnostic.
These three departures of the Crestmont assemblage from the Witte Group 2 are not minor, but
one is easily explained. That the Crestmont and Group 2 burials were made by and for the
same group has not been proven absolutely, might never be proved, or may be disproved.
That a single group created both cemeteries, utilizing Crestmont frequently during the early
Late Archaic but rarely during the terminal Late Archaic, and utilizing the Witte site more often
during the terminal Late Archaic than they had earlier, is presently considered a well-grounded
and viable hypothesis.

APPENDIX A
ARTIFACTS FOUND WITH HUMAN BONES
The following descriptions were of those items found in the osteological field bags. They are
only a few of those artifacts collected at the Crestmont site. Some described here seem not to
have been recognized in the field as non-human bones but most were hidden in the soil
adhering to the bones.

Shell
A shell pendant (Fig. lOa) was found with the skull of Feature B (female, age 25 - 35). It is
concave/convex and measures 6.3 cm long by 4.9 cm wide. The edges have been ground and
the single perforation was made by drilling from both sides. It rested on the right zygoma; there
was about 0.5 cm of soil between the ornament and the bone with the perforated edge toward
the eye orbit.
A shell ornament (Fig. lOb) was recovered from the soil adhering to the skull of Feature 14
(female, age undetermined). It is concave/convex and has one perforation, drilled from the
concave side. It measures 4 cm long by 1.6 cm wide at the perforated end and 1.9 cm at the
other; the unperforated end has been ground It lay in the soil just below the right temporal and
posteriorly to the gonial angle of the mandible. The perforated end was toward the temporal.
(Compare with Hall 1981:203, Form 10).
Two shell beads (Fig. lOc, lOd) were recovered from the soil adhering to the skull of Feature
37 (male, over 35). The smaller bead, 2.4 cm maximum length, is pierced through its entire
length. It was below the right temporal and posterior to the mandible. The larger, 4.7 cm long,
lay in the left temple area, above the zygomatic arch and posterior to the eye orbit. It has two
perforations, one at each end, from oppposite sides.

Worked Bone
A 4 cm piece of deer antler (Fig. 11 b) was found bagged with the pelvic bones of Feature 9
(female, over 35). It is hollowed out at the larger end to a depth of approximately 5 mm and is
slightly battered on the other. The hollowed-out space appears to be asphaltum-stained. It is
apparently identical to others found with this burial.
An unengraved bone ornament (Fig. lOe) was found in the soil adhering to the skull of Feature
42 (male, less than 25). It lay below the right temporal and posteriorly to the gonial angle of the
mandible. It has one perforation and measures 2.2 by 5.7 cm maximum. The perforated end
lay toward the temporal. Part of the articular surface of the bone remains above the perforation.
After the photograph was made (Fig. 10) more pieces of this ornament were found among
skull fragments. This reconstructed ornament is comparable with that in Hall 1981:225, Form
3, Specimen 14.

Lit hies
One chert flake with Feature 18 (male, over 35).
Three chert flakes with Feature 39 (male, over 35).
Two chert flakes with Feature 41 (probably female, over 35).
The dart point in the humerus of Feature 37, which was not removed from the bone. Its base is
broken away.

Animal Bones
A slightly burned deer lumbar vertebra (juvenile) was found among the vertebral and pelvic
fragments of Feature 9 (female, over 35). See Figure 1 la.
A partial right maxilla and first phalanx of a juvenile deer (Fig. 4a and 4b) were found with
Feature 25 (male, over 35). The maxilla, which contains the second and third premolars, was
bagged separately in the field and the bag marked "Found E of F-25." The phalanx was found
in the field bag containing the bones of the right hand.
The distal end of a deer fibula and a deer phalanx were found with the bones of Feature 31 (sex
undetermined, age 13).

Red Ocher
With Feature 25 (male, over 35), with postcranials.
With Feature 32 (sex undetermined, age 6 - 6.5), with postcranials.
With Feature 33 (sex undetermined, age 9 mos.), with skull.
With Feature 44A (male?, age 25-35), with left innominate.

Seed Beads
Thirty-seven whole Lithospermum seed beads were found on the screen after washing the
skull of Feature 44A. Broken pieces representing at least that many more were also recovered.
They are small, ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 mm long. They are tan-brown-stained by the soilexcept for a very narrow rim around the perforations where the original off-white color can be
seen.
Eight more of these beads and the broken remains of a few more were found among the
fragmented facial bones of Feature A.

APPENDIX B
LIST OF ARTIFACTS
The following inventory was compiled from artifact photographs on file at TARL and is almost
certainly incomplete. Artifacts found while preparing the skeletal remains for study and
described in Appendix A are included in the listings.
