MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 16 and 17 April 2019, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the portions of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.’s (Plains)
proposed W2W pipeline right-of-way (ROW) that are located on public land in northern Midland
County, Texas (Project Area). Approximately 2.6 miles (4.2 kilometers [km]) of the proposed
ROW crosses land owned by the City of Midland. Because the City of Midland is a political
subdivision of the state, the portions of the proposed ROW on the City of Midland property fall
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, the undertaking may
require the utilization of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) on one of the parcels owned by the City of Midland. As a result, this federal action
also triggers compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended. At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the
cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of Plains in compliance with the ACT and
Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological
sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the
potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The cultural resources survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee
(TAC) permit number 8859.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 91.0 miles (146.5 km) long by 100.0 feet
(30.5 meters [m]) wide, with a total area of approximately 1,103.0 acres. However, the Project
Area (i.e., the portions of the proposed ROW on the property owned by the City of Midland)
measures only 2.6 miles (4.2 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a total area of
approximately 31.5 acres.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings.
No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
38 excavated shovel tests. Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
construction of the proposed W2W pipeline ROW across property owned by the City of Midland
will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible
for designation as SALs or for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that
Plains be allowed to proceed with the construction of the proposed pipeline relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the
portions of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P.’s (Plains) proposed W2W pipeline right-of-way
(ROW) that are located on public land in northern Midland County, Texas (Project Area; Figures
1-1 through 1-4). Approximately 2.6 miles (4.2 km) of the proposed ROW crosses land owned
by the City of Midland. Because the City of Midland is a political subdivision of the state, the
portions of the proposed ROW on the City of Midland property fall under the regulations of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, the undertaking may require the utilization of a
Nationwide Permit (NWP) issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) on one of the
parcels owned by the City of Midland. As a result, this federal action also triggers compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. At the
request of Whitenton Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey
of the Project Area on behalf of Plains in compliance with the ACT and Section 106 of the
NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located
within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have
any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs) or for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 91.0 miles (146.5 km) long by 100.0 feet
(30.5 meters [m]) wide, with a total area of approximately 1,103.0 acres. However, the Project
Area (i.e., the portions of the proposed ROW on the property owned by the City of Midland)
measures only 2.6 miles (4.2 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a total area of
approximately 31.5 acres.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s president) served as the project’s Principal Investigator, while Jesse
Dalton (Horizon archeological field technician) conducted the field investigations. The cultural
resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit
number 8859.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 16 and 17 April 2019. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the Project Area. The Texas
State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel
tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the Project Area
totals 2.6 miles (4.2 km) in length, a minimum of 42 shovel tests were necessary within the
Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon fell just short of the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 38 shovel tests within the Project Area. This shortage was due to the fact
that surface impacts to one of the publicly owned parcels will be completely avoided by installing
the proposed pipeline beneath that parcel via a horizontal directional drill (HDD). As there will
be no surface impacts to this parcel, and because it was assessed as having a generally low
potential for containing undocumented cultural resources, the Horizon field crew did not assess
the parcel.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings on
the assessed publicly owned parcels. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the
Project Area or within any of the 38 excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed W2W pipeline ROW across property owned by the City of Midland will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs or listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon
therefore recommends that Plains be allowed to proceed with the construction of the proposed
pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
proposed pipeline ROW, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The portions of Plains’ proposed W2W pipeline ROW located on City of Midland property
are located on the southwestern and southeastern sides of Midland, both in Midland County,
Texas. They can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Southwest
Midland, Texas and Southeast Midland, Texas topographic quadrangle maps (see Figures 1-3
and 1-5).
The southwestern portions consist of 2 separate segments that measure
approximately 900.0 feet (274.3 meters [m]) and 2100.0 feet (640.1 m) in length (3000.0 feet
[914.4 m] total), while the southeastern portion measures approximately 10,560.0 feet (3,218.7
m) in length. All portions of the proposed ROW measure 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width, making
the overall Project Area total approximately 31.5 acres. Representative images of the Project
Area at the time of the cultural resources survey are presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-4.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located on the southwestern and southeastern sides of Midland in
far West Texas. The portions of proposed ROW comprising the Project Area are situated within
areas of gently undulating desert hills scattered with playa basins (see Figures 1-3 and 1-5).
The areas southwest of Midland consist of undeveloped desert, while the areas southeast of
Midland are active agricultural fields. Elevations within the Project Area range from 2,720.0 to
2,860.0 feet (826.1 to 871.7 m) above mean sea level. Hydrologically, Midland County drains
into 4 watersheds: Mustang Draw, Johnson Draw, Sulphur Springs Draw, and the Middle
Concho River (EPA 2019).
Aside from 2 nearby playa basins, no obvious drainages are
located near the southwestern portion of the Project Area. The southeastern portion of the
Project Area drains into Midland Draw.

2.3

CLIMATE

The climate of Midland County is semiarid. Winters are mild, with an average
temperature of 46.2 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an average
temperature of 94.5°F. The average annual total precipitation is about 14.0 inches (35.6
centimeters [cm]), with roughly 74% of it falling between May and October (NRCS 1973).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all of
Trans-Pecos Texas except the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950). Blair (1950) notes that
portions of Culberson and the surrounding counties were once part of an old bolson now
drained by the Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas of the
Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion, the Project Area is situated on geologic formations composed
of sand sheet and caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant communities
dominate the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa margins, gypsum
land, and desert shrubland. The dominant species associated with the saline flats and alkaline
playa margins plant community include Atriplex canescens (fourwing saltbush), Suaeda spp.
(seepweed), Salicornia spp. (pickleweed), and Sporobolus airoides (alkali sacaton). The
dominant species associated with the gypsum land plant community include Bouteloua
breviseta (gypsum grama), Mentzelia spp. (blazingstar), and Ephedra torreyana (Torrey’s
jointfir). The dominant species associated with the desert shrubland plant community include
Larrea tridentata (creosote bush), Flourensia cernua (American tarwort), Yucca spp. (yucca),
Artemisia filifolia (sand sagebrush), Acacia rigidula (blackbrush acacia), Cylindropuntia
leptocaulis (Christmas cactus), Agave lechuguilla (lechuguilla), and Leucophyllum frutescens
(cenizo) (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: PaleoIndian (pre-8500 B.P.),
Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic period is
further subdivided into Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), Middle Archaic (6000 to 3500 B.P.),
and Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN (PRE-8500 B.P.)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna, such as mammoth and bison, are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, also were likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are hypothesized to have been low and probably
consisted of small family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the
period may suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band
aggregation for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in
upland tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and
Folsom points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the
later span of the period.

3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 B.P.)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locations and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence
strategies in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

climates. Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy,
Hardin, and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.4

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC I (1250 TO 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow as
well as ceramics in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continued to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the recovery of
burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices also
suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas)
online database indicated the presence of 2 previously recorded archeological sites within a 1.0mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (THC 2019), while a review of the National Park
Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated
the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS
2019). The previously recorded archeological sites and their distances from the Project Area
are summarized in Table 4-1 below, while their locations relative to the Project Area are
presented in Figure 4-1. No documented cultural resources, including any listed on the NRHP,
are located within or immediately adjacent to the Project Area.

Based on the Atlas database, the southwestern segment of the Project Area has not
been previously assessed for cultural resources. The southeastern portion of the Project Area
parallels several prior linear cultural resources surveys. The first was conducted in 1996 for a
project sponsored by the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB), while the second was
conducted in 2009 in support of USACE permits for an Enterprise pipeline project. Both of
these prior surveys produced negative results where they parallel the currently proposed
undertaking.

4.2

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are
often found in proximity to playa lake beds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the
southwestern portion of Project Area in proximity to several playa basins, it was Horizon’s
opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a moderate potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural deposits within this portion of the Project Area. The southeastern portion of
the Project Area is located in proximity to Midland Draw. This originally suggested a moderate
to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within this portion of the Project
Area. However, the 2 prior negative surveys that parallel this portion of the Project Area
suggested that prehistoric sites were not as prevalent as might be expected based on the
overall setting.
Regarding historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to
the Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle maps suggested a decreased potential
for historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist crew completed the intensive survey of the Project Area on 16
and 17 April 2019. This entailed surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the
Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects
measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the Project Area totals 2.6 miles (4.2 km) in
length, a minimum of 42 shovel tests were necessary within the Project Area in order to comply
with the TSMASS. Horizon fell just short of the TSMASS by excavating a total of 38 shovel
tests within the Project Area. This shortage was due to the fact that surface impacts to one of
the publicly owned parcels will be completely avoided by installing the proposed pipeline
beneath that parcel via a horizontal directional drill (HDD). As there will be no surface impacts
to this parcel, and because it was assessed as having a generally low potential for containing
undocumented cultural resources, the Horizon field crew did not assess the parcel.
All shovel tests measured approximately 12.0 inches (30.5 centimeters [cm]) in diameter
and were excavated in arbitrary 3.9-inch (10.0-cm) levels. All excavated shovel test matrices
were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if
the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, shovel tests, and
cultural material observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were completed for every
shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts
encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site forms were to be
completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, for any previously recorded archeological sites that were assessed, updated
site forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld global positioning system (GPS) units
utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American
Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations are presented in Figures 5-1 and 5-2. Shovel
test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

On 16 and 17 April 2019, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of
the portions of Plains’ proposed W2W pipeline ROW that are located on public land in northern
Midland County, Texas. Approximately 2.6 miles (4.2 km) of the proposed ROW crosses land
owned by the City of Midland. Because the City of Midland is a political subdivision of the state,
the portions of the proposed ROW on the City of Midland property fall under the regulations of
the ACT. In addition, the undertaking may require the utilization of an NWP issued by the
USACE on one of the parcels owned by the City of Midland. As a result, this federal action also
triggers compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended. At the request of
Whitenton, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of
Plains in compliance with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey
was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any
existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as SALs or for inclusion in the NRHP. The cultural
resources survey was conducted under TAC permit number 8859.
Overall, the entire proposed ROW measures 91.0 miles (146.5 km) long by 100.0 feet
(30.5 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 1,103.0 acres. However, the Project Area (i.e.,
the portions of the proposed ROW on the property owned by the City of Midland) measures only
2.6 miles (4.2 km) long by 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, with a total area of approximately 31.5
acres.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 16 and 17 April 2019. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing across the Project Area. The Texas
State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel
tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide. As the Project Area
totals 2.6 miles (4.2 km) in length, a minimum of 42 shovel tests were necessary within the
Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon fell just short of the TSMASS by
excavating a total of 38 shovel tests within the Project Area. This shortage was due to the fact
that surface impacts to one of the publicly owned parcels will be completely avoided by installing
the proposed pipeline beneath that parcel via a horizontal directional drill (HDD). As there will
be no surface impacts to this parcel, and because it was assessed as having a generally low

potential for containing undocumented cultural resources, the Horizon field crew did not assess
the parcel.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings on
the assessed publicly owned parcels. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the
Project Area or within any of the 38 excavated shovel tests.
While several of the shovel tests excavated during the field investigations revealed
shallow clay deposits, the majority consisted of relatively deep sandy loam that typically
terminated at sandy clay soils at depths between 31.5 and 39.4 inches (80.0 and 100 cm) below
surface (see Shovel Test Data in Appendix A).

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
proposed W2W pipeline ROW across property owned by the City of Midland will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs or listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. Horizon
therefore recommends that Plains be allowed to proceed with the construction of the proposed
pipeline relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
proposed pipeline ROW, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
