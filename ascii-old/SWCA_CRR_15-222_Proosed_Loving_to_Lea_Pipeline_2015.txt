MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Project Title. Cultural Resources Survey for the Proposed Loving to Lea Pipeline, Loving County,
Texas
SWCA Project Number. 28642
Project Description. SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an archaeological
background review and intensive pedestrian survey for the Sunoco Logistics, L.P. (Sunoco) Delaware
Basin Pipeline Project on private land in Loving County, Texas, to determine whether the undertaking
would impact any significant archaeological resources.
Location. The project area is located on private land, approximately 17.7 km (11 miles) northeast of the
town of Mentone in Loving County, Texas. The project is on the Rudd Draw Northeast and Rudd Draw,
Texas, 7.5-minute U.S. Geological Survey quadrangles.
Number of Acres Surveyed. 804.66 acres
Principal Investigator. Cherie Walth
Date of Work. February 23–May 10, 2015
Purpose of Work. Sunoco proposes to construct a new 42-km-long (26-mile-long) crude oil pipeline
and associated aboveground appurtenant facilities. The Loving to Lea Pipeline will be a 30.5-cm-diameter
(12-inch-diameter) pipeline that starts at the proposed McLoving Station in Loving County, Texas, and
proceeds north approximately 41 km (26 miles) to the Lea Station in Lea County, New Mexico.
The project qualifies as a federal undertaking subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended, and its implementing regulations (36 Code of Federal Regulations Part 800).
The Bureau of Land Management Carlsbad Field Office is the lead federal agency for the project.
The area of potential effects (APE) for the project is the construction workspace, which includes Sunoco’s
proposed right-of-way (ROW) and a 5-acre parcel of land immediately southeast of the southern extent of
the survey corridor. The total APE is approximately 100 acres. The proposed pipeline corridor on private
land in Texas is 30.48 m (100 feet) wide. An additional 45.72 m (150 feet) was surveyed on both sides of
the centerline to create a buffer for temporary work space around the pipeline. Thus, a 122-m (400-foot)
corridor was surveyed for the length of the project, measuring a total of 804.66 acres. The surveyed area
fully included the APE, of which Sunoco had marked the centerline with lath prior to the archaeological
survey.
Properties Identified. Twenty-seven isolated manifestations (IMs) and eight prehistoric archaeological
sites were documented within the project area. The IMs consist of prehistoric flaked stone debitage,
ground stone fragments, one projectile point, fire-cracked rock, and a historic boundary marker. Seven of
the sites are artifact scatters, and one is an artifact scatter with an associated feature. Five are
recommended eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Eligibility of Properties. Sites 41LV24, 41LV25, 41LV26, 41LV28, and 41LV31 are recommended
eligible to the NRHP under Criterion D. Sites 41LV27, 41LV29, and 41LV30 are recommended not
eligible to the NRHP.
Curation. No artifacts were collected, resulting in no curation.

Comments. Sunoco proposes to construct a new pipeline with associated appurtenant facilities from the
proposed McLoving Station in Loving County, Texas, to the Lea Station in Lea County, New Mexico.
This report focuses on a 17.7-km (11-mile) section of proposed pipeline in Loving County, Texas. The
APE includes the proposed ROW for staging and pipe-stringing activities and the proposed construction
of a pump station on a 5-acre parcel adjacent to the southern edge of the pipeline. An archaeological
survey of the APE resulted in the discovery of eight sites, five of which are recommended eligible for the
NRHP.
Sites 41LV24, 41LV25, 41LV26, 41LV28, and 41LV31 are all considered eligible for the NRHP under
Criterion D, as all likely contain buried deposits that have research potential to address research domains
for this area in Texas and New Mexico. Specifically these sites have the potential to yield information that
would aid in understanding prehistoric mobility and subsistence strategies in the area. These sites will all
be avoided by the proposed project, three by reroutes of the pipeline; two because they are located outside
the proposed project area. If mitigation recommendations are followed for the recommended eligible
sites, there will be no impact to these resources.
Sites 41LV27, 41LV29, and 41LV30 and the IMs are recommended not eligible for the NRHP; therefore,
no further work is recommended for these resources.

INTRODUCTION
Sunoco Logistics Partners, LP (Sunoco), has filed a right-of-way (ROW) application with the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) for the construction and operation of a 42-km-long (26-mile-long) crude oil
pipeline and associated aboveground appurtenant facilities in southeast New Mexico and Texas. The
pipeline would start at the proposed McLoving Station in Loving County, Texas. Leaving McLoving
Station, the pipeline would proceed north-northeast across the state line to connect to the Lea Station
located in Lea County, New Mexico. The pipeline would cross over approximately 15.68 km (9.74 miles)
of BLM-administered land, 5.42 km (3.37 miles) of state-owned land in New Mexico, and 21.18 km
(13.16 miles) of privately owned land in both New Mexico and Texas (Figure 1).
The equipment required for construction of the pipeline and aboveground facilities would include
trenchers, trackhoes, sidebooms, and other tractors. In addition, personal trucks, welding trucks, cranes,
and flatbed trailers would be required. The majority of heavy equipment that would be necessary would
remain in the construction ROW, minimizing activity on public roads. Sunoco is requesting a 22.86-mwide (75-foot-wide) construction ROW during the installation of the proposed pipeline on BLM and New
Mexico State Land Office (SLO) lands in New Mexico and a 30.48-m-wide (100-foot-wide) construction
ROW on private lands in both New Mexico and Texas. The 22.86-m (75-foot) ROW on BLM and SLO
lands would consist of 13.76 m (45 feet) of temporary ROW to be used only during construction and 9.14
m (30 feet) of permanent ROW. The 30.48-m (100-foot) ROW on private lands would consist of 15.24 m
(50 feet) of temporary ROW to be used only during construction and 15.24 m (50 feet) of permanent
ROW. Additional temporary workspace may also be required for staging areas or other constructionrelated needs.
Sunoco selected SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) to conduct an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the area of potential effect (APE) to aid in complying with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act. The New Mexico portion of the project is on private lands and on
lands administered by the BLM Carlsbad Field Office (CFO) and the New Mexico State Land Office. The
Texas portion of the project is on private lands with no federal nexus and is located immediately south of
and adjacent to the New Mexico border and 17.7 km (11 miles) northeast of the town of Mentone in
Loving County, Texas. It is located on the Rudd Draw NE (31103-H5) and Rudd Draw (31103-G5) 7.5minute U.S. Geological Survey quadrangles (Figure 2 - Figure 11).
This report details the results of a Class III intensive archaeological survey by SWCA for the segment of
the proposed Loving to Lea pipeline located in Texas. SWCA conducted the cultural resources survey on
February 23 to March 2, 17, 28, and 29, April 11–15, and May 10, 2015. Three previously recorded sites
were visited in the New Mexico portion of the project, and eight newly recorded sites were documented in
Texas. A total of seven isolated manifestations (IMs) was recorded in the New Mexico segment and 27
IMs in the Texas segment.
Cherie Walth acted as Principal Investigator for the survey and fieldwork investigations were conducted
by Heather West, Eric Petersen, Scott Yost, Megan Weldy, Jim Quaranta, Jordan Taher, Cody James, and
Kelton Meyer during multiple field sessions between February 23 and May 10, 2015.

NATURAL AND CULTURAL SETTING
The project area lies within the northeastern portion of the Chihuahuan Desert in the Permian Basin in
mesquite shrub dune habitat approximately 17.7 km (11 miles) northeast of the town of Mentone and 20
km (12.5 miles) east of Highway 287. The project area and surrounding region have been impacted by oil
drilling and pipeline activities, and the survey corridor is within the greater Permian Basin Oil Field. The

Natural Setting
The project area lies within an area of parabolic/coppice dunes in the Permian Basin region of west Texas.
The project area is generally within the Basin and Range physiographic province and the northeastern
portion of the Chihuahuan Desert, a high arid desert and the largest of the creosotebush deserts in North
America (Brown 1994:169). Annual temperature extremes are (or can be) significant, with summer
temperatures regularly exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit and winter temperatures dropping well below
freezing. The majority of precipitation occurs during the summer months and is associated with
thunderstorms. Precipitation ranges from around 3.1 to 30.5 cm (8–12 inches) a year. The combination of
rainfall and temperature makes for marked seasonality and a long growing season.
Rattlesnake Flat is 0.6 km (1 mile) to the north, and Paduca Breaks and the Red Hills are approximately
13 km (8 miles) northwest of the survey corridor. Nearby drainages include Rudd Draw, which is 4.5 km
(2.8 miles) south of the southern edge and curves to the northeast 3.9 km (2.4 miles) east of the project
area. Salado Draw is 13.5 km (8.4 miles) northwest of the project area. Numerous small intermittent lakes
are 3.2 km (2 miles) to the west and 17.7 km (11 miles) east of the survey corridor
Vegetation in the project area is low to moderate in occurrence. Dominant species include mesquite
shrub, acacia, low shinnery oak, and creosote bush. It is generally thought that there has been little change
in the vegetation and climate of the area since middle Holocene times (8000 B.P.); thus, current
environmental conditions provide a context for interpreting the prehistoric occupation of the area (e.g.,
O’Laughlin et al. 1988). Animals that would have been commonly found in the area prior to development
of the oil fields include jackrabbit and cottontail rabbit, deer, pronghorn, various rats and mice, coyote,
snakes, turtles, quail, and badger. Many of these species were also of economic importance to the
prehistoric peoples of the area.

Cultural Setting
The project area is located in Loving County, Texas, extending approximately 17.7 km (11 miles) south
of the Texas-New Mexico border. The following archaeological background describes prehistoric
lifeways in southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Humans have inhabited southeast New Mexico and
west Texas for at least the last 13,000 years. This occupation reflects a sequence of cultural development
stretching from hunting and gathering, through the development of agriculture, to historic and modern
life. The culture history of the region is commonly divided into four broad periods—Paleoindian,
Archaic, Formative, and historic—each of which is typified by different cultural adaptations. As part of
the effort to revise the CFO Regional Management Plan, Jim Railey from SWCA authored a Class I
analysis of all known archaeological resources in the CFO region (Railey 2013). The following discussion
is adapted from Railey (2013) based on the proximity of the project area to southeast New Mexico, and
supported by the similarity of the cultural resource findings. Because only prehistoric sites were
encountered in the field, a discussion of historic settlement in Texas is excluded from this discussion.

Paleoindian Tradition (11,500–7000 B.C.)
The earliest, well-established presence of humans in the region dates from Paleoindian tradition (ca.
11,500–7000 B.C.), which is customarily divided into three periods: Clovis (11,500–10,800 B.C.),
Folsom (10,800–9800 B.C.), and Late Paleoindian, or Plano (9800–7000 B.C.). Paleoindian sites and
components in the Jornada Mogollon region are recognized almost exclusively by diagnostic artifacts
associated with each of these periods (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:213), and chronometrically dated at
camp or kill sites, including ones in eastern New Mexico and west Texas (e.g., Haynes 1992; Holliday
1997; Johnson and Holliday 1981). There are few identified Paleoindian components in the region,
although their components suggest concentrations along the Pecos River, the Mescalero Escarpment Base,

and in far southeastern Lea County, New Mexico near what were probably pluvial lakes (Condon and
Smith 2012).
The Paleoindian tradition is best known from assemblages of flaked stone artifacts, and the emphasis on
formal, retouched tools during this time reflects a reliable and maintainable tool kit that kept highly
mobile hunter-foragers prepared for a variety of circumstances and encounter situations (Bleed 1986;
Kelly and Todd 1988; Jennings et al. 2010). Ground stone tools were rarely, if ever, used during
Paleoindian times, and this (along with the absence of baking pits and hot-rock cooking) reflects an
emphasis on meat in the diet, and a lack of exploitation of seeds and other low-ranking food resources
that required extending processing prior to consumption (see Bettinger 2001).
Three Paleoindian complexes have been identified in the region, based on morphologically distinct
projectile point styles. The Clovis period corresponds to the Younger Dryas, a climatic interval toward the
end of the Pleistocene that was cool and dry (Cordell 1997:89; Haynes 2008; Holliday and Meltzer 2010;
Polyak et al. 2004). Clovis people hunted mammoths and other Pleistocene megafauna, along with
smaller animals (Cannon and Meltzer 2008; Cordell and McBrinn 2012:110). Tool assemblages include
not only the distinctive Clovis fluted point, but also large flake blades, biface and blade cores, knives,
scrapers, core choppers, and burins (see Collins 2007).
During the Folsom period (10,800–9800 B.C.), the climate in the eastern Southwest and Southern Plains
became both warmer and wetter (Cordell and McBrinn 2012:115; Polyak et al. 2004). The mobile hunterforager lifeway continued. Mammoths were extinct by this time, and the focus of big-game hunting
shifted to Bison antiquus, a larger ancestor of the present-day bison (MacDonald 1981; Meltzer 2009;
Surovell 2009). Smaller animals were also hunted by Folsom and later Paleoindian groups as well (Amick
1996; Bamforth 2002; Cannon and Meltzer 2004). Tool kits were somewhat more diverse than those of
the Clovis period and include the diagnostic Folsom fluted points and their unfluted counterparts (called
Midland points), along with knives, gravers, spokeshaves, pointed scrapers, cores (bifacial, discoidal, and
informal), drills, burins, choppers, abrading stones, awls, and needles (Frison and Bradley 1980; Huckell
and Judge 2006; Meltzer 2006).
The warming trend during Folsom times continued during the subsequent Late Paleoindian or Plano
period (9800–7000 B.C.), but precipitation trends reverse as drier conditions once again set in (Mallouf
1981; Monger and Buck 1995; Van Devender 1990). The fluted points of the Clovis and Folsom periods
were replaced by various unfluted lanceolate styles, classified within various complexes such as
Plainview, Firstview, and Cody (Cordell and McBrinn 2012:106–107). Otherwise, tool assemblages were,
overall, similar to those of the previous periods. People continued to rely on hunting and foraging for their
subsistence (Cannon and Meltzer 2004). Bison continued to be the main big-game prey, although Bison
antiquus was extinct by this time, with smaller bison similar to the present-day species having taken their
place (MacDonald 1981).

Archaic Tradition (7000 B.C.–A.D. 500)
The Archaic tradition covers a vast swath of time between the end of the Paleoindian tradition and the
appearance of ceramics around A.D. 500. Archaic cultural history, classification, and chronology in the
region rely to a large extent on frameworks developed in neighboring regions (e.g., Irwin-Williams 1973,
1979; Johnson and Holliday 2004:290–292; MacNeish 1993; MacNeish and Beckett 1987; Mallouf 1985,
2005; Sayles 1983; Sayles and Antevs 1941; see also Huckell 1996:319–323; Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:218). Three Archaic periods are widely recognized in the region: Early Archaic (6000–3200 B.C.),
Middle Archaic (3200–1800 B.C.), and Late Archaic (1800 B.C.–A.D. 500). However, these periods and
their bracketing dates do not correspond very closely to some important changes in climate, subsistence
economics, and other developments over the course of the Archaic tradition. Also, depending on which

SWCA Environmental Consultants

chronology is used there is a hiatus lasting anywhere from 500 to 1,000 years between the dates
bracketing the end of the Paleoindian and beginning of the Archaic tradition. There is debate as to the
significance of this apparent hiatus; Irwin-Williams (1979:35) argued that the hiatus reflects migration of
Paleoindian hunters out of the desert Southwest to the north, with desert-adapted hunter-gatherers from
the Great Basin filling in behind them. As with the Paleoindian tradition, identification of Archaic periods
at sites in the region relies primarily on diagnostic projectile points, although the advent of pit baking led
to the creation and enhancement chronometrically datable archaeological contexts. The result is that we
have many radiocarbon dates for the Archaic tradition, and the identification of components does not rely
as much on projectile points as it does for those dating from Paleoindian times.
The most diagnostic artifacts on Archaic sites are atlatl dart points. These points can vary greatly in shape
and usually appear less well made than Paleoindian points. If the different morphological types reflect
different ethnic or kinship groups, the great variety of point forms from Archaic sites in west Texas and
southeastern New Mexico may indicate that several different Archaic groups used the area (Phippen et al.
2000:468–470; Sebastian and Larralde 1989:42). Another possibility is that the different point types
reflect reworking and repair of broken points (Flenniken and Wilke 1989). After Paleoindian times there
was a transition from lanceolate to mostly stemmed projectile points, including the Jay and Bajada types
of Irwin-Williams’ (1973, 1979) Oshara tradition, and Uvalde and other types identified in central and
west Texas (Prewitt 1981; Turpin 1994:70; Weir 1976; see also Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:220).
Scrapers, knives, and chopping tools are common, although Irwin-Williams (1973, 1979) reports that
ground stone was lacking in the Jay phase (5500–4800 B.C.) and does not mention its occurrence in the
subsequent Bajada phase (4800–3200 B.C.). Ground stone milling tools are reported from Early Archaic
contexts in the western Jornada Mogollon region (MacNeish 1993). Irwin-Williams (1973:6–7) notes the
appearance of cooking pits with burned rock in the Bajada phase, and in west Texas and the western
Jornada area hot-rock cooking and a broad-spectrum subsistence pattern were established during the Early
Archaic period (Dering 1999; Mallouf 1985; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:220–221; Turpin 1994:70).
The Early Archaic period falls mostly or entirely within the Altithermal, an exceptionally dry interval that
apparently led to a drastic reduction of available surface water (Antevs 1948, 1953, 1955; Haynes 1975;
Hester 1972; Holliday 1989; Johnson and Holliday 1986, 2004:290–291; Meltzer 1991). Whether this
involved an increase in average temperatures or reduced precipitation remains somewhat of an open
question, but in all likelihood both factors were at play (Meltzer and Collins 1987). These conditions
prevailed for a long interval beginning around 6000 B.C. and lasted until sometime between 3000 and
2000 B.C. (i.e., into the Middle Archaic period). East of the Pecos River many springs, marshes, and
playa lakes probably dried up during the Altithermal, leaving available water sources localized and
dispersed. This may have led to intensified competition, starvation, and out-migration on an appreciable
scale. At least some of those who stayed on the Llano Estacado and around its margins resorted to digging
water wells at springs and playas that had dried up, but where water could still be found just below the
surface.
During the Middle Archaic period projectile point styles diversify somewhat, both within and between
regions, although in general points have either contracted stems with flat, rounded, or pointed bases or
expanded stems with concave bases (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:225). A broad-spectrum subsistence
economy was well established by Middle Archaic times, including the use of low-ranking seeds and roots
that require extensive processing prior to consumption. This is evidenced not only by biotic remains, but
also by the common occurrence of ground stone milling tools, cooking pits, and burned rock in Middle
Archaic contexts (Huckell 1996:336–342; Mallouf 1985; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:224–225). The
earliest maize in the Southwest dates from the near the end of the Middle Archaic time frame (Mabry
2005), although no maize or other cultigens are known for this period in or near the region.

The arid climate of the Altithermal continued into at least the early portion of the Middle Archaic period
(Antevs 1948, 1953, 1955; Haynes 1975; Hester 1972; Johnson and Holliday 1986, 2004:290–291;
Meltzer 1991), but conditions improved beginning sometime during the interval 3000–2000 B.C., when
the climate became wetter or cooler across the region (Berry and Berry 1986:312–314; Cordell and
McBrinn 2012:125; Hogan 1983, 1994; Johnson and Holliday 2004:291; Mehringer 1967; Mehringer et
al. 1966; Oldfield and Schoenwetter 1975; Petersen 1981; Smith 2002; Smith and McFaul 1997;
Wendlund and Bryson 1974). This led to a proliferation and resurgence of reliable sources of surface
water and a widespread expansion and enrichment of the available biomass (Johnson and Holliday
2004:291). The improved climatic conditions are probably largely responsible for a dramatic increase and
ubiquity of archaeological sites and radiocarbon dates, and a much more extensive and ubiquitous
distribution of sites across the landscape that begins in the Middle Archaic period (Berry and Berry 1986;
Carmichael 1986; Mallouf 1985, 2005:219; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:223; Railey et al. 2011; Walth and
Railey 2011:352–366). Sites become common in many upland areas, and desert basin floors and plains
away from river corridors, which had been largely unoccupied during the mid-Holocene. At present, the
data suggest some increase in population levels from the Early to Middle Archaic periods, but the
evidence is weak and population levels apparently remained low throughout Middle Archaic times.
The Late Archaic period (1800 B.C.–A.D. 500) witnessed a continuation and intensification of trends set
in motion following the end of Pleistocene, and in many respects marks a major turning point in the
prehistory of the Southwest and Southern Plains. Diagnostic projectile points are mostly expanded stem
forms with varying blade shapes that may or may not have strong shoulders (e.g., Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:Figure 7-11), although other styles are found as well, including bifurcated base and straight-stem
forms (Mallouf 2005:226). Maize-based farming becomes widespread throughout the Southwest as an
addition to the broad-spectrum hunting-gathering subsistence economy (Cordell and McBrinn 2012:136–
149; Huckell 1996:343–349). There was pre-ceramic maize in portions of the Jornada Mogollon region
(e.g., Campbell and Railey 2008; Tagg 1996; Upham et al. 1987; Wills and Huckell 1994:42), but thus far
there is no clear evidence of Late Archaic farming in this portion of west Texas. A proliferation of pit
houses, bell-shaped pits, and sites with middens and abundant artifacts, suggests reduced mobility under
increasing population densities (Huckell 1996:343–349), but again these trends are not evident at present
in the region. In fact, at present there are no discernible structure remains or storage pits known for the
Late Archaic period in the region, rich midden deposits are rare or absent, and the vast majority of
features consist of hearths, roasting pits, and burned-rock middens, the latter mostly west of the Pecos
River. In other words, the archaeological evidence strongly suggests a continuation of highly mobile,
hunter-gatherer lifeways across at least most of the local region during Late Archaic times.
Despite the continuation of a highly mobile, hunter-gatherer lifeway, there were some important changes
and developments in the Late Archaic period of the region. The favorable climatic trend that began during
Middle Archaic times continued into the Late Archaic period, with the cooler and wetter conditions
resulting in an increased biomass and proliferation of new water sources across the landscape (cf., Berry
and Berry 1986:312–314; Cordell and McBrinn 2012:125; Hogan 1983, 1994; Johnson and Holliday
2004:291; Mehringer 1967; Mehringer et al. 1966; Oldfield and Schoenwetter 1975; Petersen 1981;
Polyak and Asmerom 2001; Smith 2002; Smith and McFaul 1997; Wendlund and Bryson 1974). The vast
plains east of the Pecos River were probably too dry for intensive and efficient foraging during the Early
Archaic and most of the Middle Archaic period, but by Late Archaic times hunter-gatherers in the region
were beginning to fully realize the potential of the landscape’s enriched resource abundance. The
widespread occurrence of freshwater mussel shell at many sites across the landscape suggests the
possibility that aquatic habitats occurred along many now-dry drainages in the region, most of which were
probably also dry during the Altithermal. Among other things the favorable climate and enhanced
biomass that continued into Late Archaic times included an enrichment of grassland habitats, which
apparently resulted in increased numbers of bison and a new round of bison hunting over a broad region.

Archaeological evidence suggests the improved climatic conditions of Late Archaic times had two
important effects within the region: 1) a sharp population increase, and 2) new foraging opportunities for
hunter-gatherers that allowed for more ubiquitous use of the landscape through residential mobility. The
dramatic increase in Late Archaic components and radiocarbon dates indicates intensified and more
ubiquitous exploitation of the landscape. This is part of a broad pattern across the Southwest and Southern
Plains, in which people expanded into all ecological zones, including once-marginal ones such as uplands
and intermountain desert basins (Berry and Berry 1986; Carmichael 1986; Mallouf 1985, 2005:219;
Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:226; Railey et al. 2011; Walth and Railey 2011:352–366). Similarly, in the
region not only do site components, dates, and diagnostic artifacts increase sharply at this time, but they
are also distributed widely across the landscape. In terms of hunter-gatherer mobility and subsistence,
these patterns are probably the result of the improved climatic conditions, population growth, and changes
in mobility. The more common availability of surface water, and increased resource abundance across the
landscape, meant that hunter-gatherers could now forage more efficiently, moving their camps more
frequently around the landscape. This strategy would have decreased the distance and time involved in
daily foraging trips, translating into a greater return of caloric intake per unit of energy expended (cf.
Kelly 1995:111–148). Archaeologically this would all result in higher numbers, and a more ubiquitous
distribution of, preserved camp remains (such as artifact scatters and cooking pits), relative to previous
time periods. This is precisely what we see for the Late Archaic period in the region.

Formative Tradition (A.D. 500–1450)
“Formative” is a term commonly applied by archaeologists to the ceramic periods of the Jornada
Mogollon region (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:236–237). The well-dated sequence of sites in the Hondo
Valley, northwest of the region, suggests that ceramics appeared there around A.D. 500 (Campbell and
Railey 2008), and this date is used here for the beginning of the Formative tradition. The addition of
ceramics to the inventory of artifacts provides a tremendous advantage in recognizing Formative period
site components as compared to pre-ceramic ones. Ceramics also enhance temporal resolution and age
estimates of site components, especially for the more distinctive, painted wares that can cross-date
between different regions. For this discussion, the Formative tradition is simply divided into two periods:
Early (ca. A.D. 500–1100) and Late Formative (ca. A.D. 1100–1450), with the appearance of Chupadero
Black-on-white being the most prominent marker separating the two. Phase divisions within these periods
can certainly be suggested based in part on the appearance of certain key marker traits, such as early
black-on-white ceramics toward the end of the Early Formative, and a variety of distinctive glaze ware
and polychromes after ca. A.D. 1300. But the development of well-established phase sequences will
depend on excavation data from more sites with securely dated, single-component contexts. The early
centuries of the Formative time frame witnessed little change in subsistence and mobility from the Late
Archaic. But significant changes did occur in the Late Formative period, although for the general region
some of the more important Late Formative developments are inferred from surrounding regions, and
further research will hopefully clarify the specifics of these in the project region.
Two prominent changes in artifact assemblages mark the beginning of the Early Formative period. One is
the appearance of ceramics, which in the beginning consist of undecorated brown wares. These are
variously classified according to paste characteristics as Jornada Brown, McKenzie Brown, Middle Pecos
Micaceous Brown, South Pecos Brown, and Alma Plain (Hill 1996, 2000, 2001; Hogan 2006; Jelinek
1967; Katz and Katz 1985, 1993, 2001; Kelley 1984; Leslie 1979; Mera 1943; Reed et al. 2002:550–551;
Runyan and Hedrick 1987; Whalen 1981; Wilson 2000a, 2000b, 2003; Wiseman 1996, 2002), and which
persist well into Late Formative time frame. Early black-on-white ceramics (e.g., Cebolleta, Red Mesa,
Mimbres) appear in the region after ca. A.D. 750 (Katz and Katz 1993), but do not occur at all sites in the
later centuries of the Early Formative, and undecorated brown wares continue to dominate ceramic
assemblages throughout the period.

The introduction of the bow and arrow is inferred from a sharp reduction in the size of projectile points,
which occurs across most of sub-boreal North American around A.D. 500–600, (Bettinger and Eerkens
1999; Bettinger and Taylor 1974; Blitz 1988:130–132; Cordell 1979:134, 1997; Guernsey 1931:71–72,
99, 107; Huckell 1998; Justice 2002:44; Lipe 1978:369; Nassaney and Pyle 1999; Railey 2010; Seeman
1992; Shott 1993; Torres 2000:227; VanPool 2006:433; Yerkes and Pecora 1991). In the Southwest and
Southern Plains, the earliest arrow points are strongly shouldered, corner-notched or stemmed forms. At
the well-dated series of sites in the Hondo Valley of the Sierra Blanca highlands (Campbell and Railey
2008; Railey 2010), the earliest arrow points have shouldered, recurved blades similar to the Bonham and
Homan types in northeast Texas (Turner and Hester 1993:202, 219), and these are quickly followed by
straight-bladed points with tanged shoulders and corner notching. The latter forms, similar to the Scallorn
type of the Plains (Turner and Hester 1993:230) and the Trujillo and Dolores types in northern New
Mexico (Justice 2002; Turnbow 1997:202–205), persist throughout the remainder of the Early Formative
period and continue into the early portion of the Late Formative.
Except for the addition of ceramics and arrow points, Early Formative artifact assemblages remain similar
to those of the Late Archaic, with a variety of flaked stone tools and ground stone milling implements.
Other aspects of the Early Formative archaeological record also persist from Late Archaic times. There is
still a notable dearth of preserved house remains; the few dating from the Early Formative period in the
region come from just four sites (Jones et al. 2010; Railey 2011; Zamora 2000), and their characteristics
suggest rather expedient, wickiup-like brush huts set in shallow basins. The lack of evidence for
substantially constructed houses prior to the Late Formative suggests people across at least most of the
region did not invest heavily in residential architecture, and this is typical of highly mobile huntergatherers (Binford 1990; Kelly 1995:139–140).
Botanical remains of various wild plants, including cheno-ams, wild barley, and others are common
occurrences (e.g., Acklen and Railey 2001; Brown 2011; Condon et al. 2008; Lord and Reynolds 1985;
Railey 2011; Simpson 2004), along with succulents processed in burned-rock middens in the western
portion of the region (Jones et al. 2010). Unlike the Late Archaic, in the region there is one instance of
charred maize associated with a radiocarbon date for the Early Formative, at a site in the Guadalupe
Mountains (Kemrer 1998). Otherwise, at present there is a complete lack of domesticates in
macrobotanical assemblages in securely dated, pre-Late Formative contexts, and this indicates that
farming was not an important part of the subsistence economy (or was not practiced at all) across most of
the region during Early Formative times.
The onset of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (A.D. 800/900–1350) reportedly ushered in a dry period
that heavily impacted people across much of western North America (Jones et al. 1999). The data suggest
that people responded to this drastic climatic change by withdrawing to areas where reliable sources of
surface water could still be found, which includes the Pecos River and, apparently, playas, areas below
escarpment edges (most notably along the base of the Mescalero Escarpment, where freshwater springs
probably continued to issue forth), and in the Mountain Slope area. In the latter area, most of the dates are
from burned-rock middens, so the numbers may also indicate an upswing in the use of these sites and
exploitation of low-rank, high-cost food resources processed at them (see Dering 1999). Although
precipitation levels apparently increased again toward the end of the Early Formative, the damage
apparently was already done, and the response to the period of severe drought may have helped prompt
some fundamental changes in cultural adaptations that took hold during the subsequent Late Formative
period.
The Late Formative period indeed witnessed some of the most profound changes in the prehistory of the
region. In terms of artifacts, the most prominent temporal indices of this period are a variety of distinct
and relatively well-dated decorated ceramic types. Chupadero Black-on-white and El Paso painted
(bichrome and early polychromes, and later just El Paso polychrome) are present by the beginning of this

period, or soon after, eventually edge out undecorated brown wares, and persist as common types
throughout the Late Formative time frame (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:252–253; Speth and Newlander
2012; Wilson 2000b). Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta is another distinctive type that appears in the region
around the beginning of the Late Formative period, but is less common than the Chupadero and El Paso
painted wares (Runyan and Hedrick 1987). Chupadero wares were manufactured in the Sierra Blanca
highlands (Clark 2006; Creel et al. 2002; Reed et al. 2002). Also from this region is Corona Corrugated, a
utilitarian ware that appears around or soon after A.D. 1200 (Kelley 1984; Wiseman 2002). St. Johns
Polychrome appears at about this same time (Miller 1995; Runyan and Hedrick 1987). After A.D. 1300,
exotic ceramic types from a variety of areas in the Southwest appear in west Texas and southeastern New
Mexico, including Rio Grande glaze wares, Lincoln Black-on-red from the Sierra Blanca highlands in
New Mexico, Ramos Polychrome from the Casas Grandes area, and Gila Polychrome from the Salado
region (Katz and Katz 1993; Miller 1995). Another post-A.D. 1300 ceramic type is Ochoa Indented, a
Southern Plains type that appears to be restricted to areas east of the Pecos River (Katz and Katz 1993).
Also occurring in the Late Formative period is a widely documented shift in arrow point morphology
during the thirteenth century. The earlier, corner-notched arrow point styles with strong shoulders are
replaced by side-notched arrow points with wide, squared, or concave bases. These late forms are usually
referred to as Harrell, Desert Side-notched, Washita, or Pueblo Side-notched (Justice 2002; Speth 2004;
Turnbow 1997; Turner and Hester 1993). Unnotched triangular points are rare in the Southwest, but do
occur in the Plains (and are especially common in eastern North America) and spill over in small numbers
into the project vicinity. In Texas these are usually referred to as Fresno points, and their reported time
span (ca. A.D. 800–1700) is not as restricted as those for the other arrow point types discussed above.
There is evidence to suggest that these unnotched triangular points are actually preforms that were
intended to be finished and notched, and they were widely transported as they were less fragile and
susceptible to breakage than finished points (cf. Chesier and Kelly 2006; Dawe 1987; Newlander and
Speth 2009).
By A.D. 1300, if not earlier, substantially occupied “villages” were established across much of the larger
region. This was part of widespread pattern of greater sedentism and village formation across the southern
Great Plains and Jornada Mogollon region in the early to mid-second millennium A.D. (Brooks 2004;
Campbell 1976; Drass 1998; Drass and Flynn 1990; Jelinek 1967; Kalasz et al. 1999:195–198; Kelley
1984; Lintz 1984, 1986, 1991; Lutes 1959; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Speth 2004, 2005; Speth and
Newlander 2012; Wendorf 1960; Wiseman 1981, 1985, 2002; Zamora and Oakes 2000). Most of what we
know about Late Formative “village” sites in the region comes from excavations carried out decades ago,
using pre-modern methods. A cluster of villages were occupied in the project vicinity at the Andrews
Lake site, several of which have been excavated (Collins 1966, 1968). Jennings (1940) excavations at
Rio Peñasco and two neighboring sites provide a glimpse of Late Formative village life in the Mountain
Slope area. Decades ago the Lea County Archaeological Society (LCAS) excavated several village sites,
including Boot Hill (Corley and Leslie 1960) and Laguna Plata (LCAS 1971). Eastern New Mexico
University’s subsequent excavations at Laguna Plata (Haskell 1977) and TRC’s recent investigations at
Laguna Plata (Brown 2010) and Boot Hill (Brown 2011) added additional information about these two
important sites. In addition, as part of the BLM CFO Permian Basin Mitigation Program in New Mexico,
recent investigations were carried out at the Maroon Cliffs, a sprawling site complex west of the project
area that includes substantial remains of Late Formation occupations (Stowe and Condon 2012). Surveylevel investigations have also documented sites with intensive Late Formative occupations in the
Mescalero Plain and Escarpment Base areas. These include Indian Hill (LA 32228, also known as Taylor
Peak), where a burial, a pit house, and charred maize were found (Hunt 1989), and a sprawling site
complex in the vicinity of the Merchant site (Lone Mountain Archaeological Services [LMAS] 2001).
Late Formative village sites tend to occur in areas where springs, precipitation runoff, or playa lakes
offered reliable sources of surface water, and at least limited riparian environments and associated
resources. The base of the Mescalero Escarpment was an especially favored zone for these sites.

As far as detailed information pertaining to the role of maize in Late Formative subsistence economies of
west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, the closest comparative evidence we have to date comes from
two settlements west of Roswell, New Mexico: Henderson and Bloom Mound (Kelley 1984; Powell
2001; Speth 2004, 2005). For these sites, the evidence
points to farming as a modest contributor to the diet throughout, with little or no
indication of significant intensification in the later part of the sequence (e.g., small
numbers of recovered maize remains; ubiquity and abundance of wild seeds; carbon
isotope values indicating modest overall intake of C4 plants; low incidence of [dental]
caries; small numbers of metates, mostly basin-shaped; and wholly unstandardized oneand two-handed manos). (Speth and LeDuc 2007:46)
Another important subsistence trend that inhabitants of these Late Formative villages were caught up in
was an increased emphasis on bison hunting across the region and elsewhere in the southern Plains after
ca. A.D. 1250, following a regional hiatus in bison hunting that began in A.D. 500 (Baugh 1986; Bozell
1995; Brooks 2004; Collins 1968, 1971; Creel 1991; Dillehay 1974; Drass and Flynn 1990; Greer 1976;
Hughes 1989; Jelinek 1967; Speth 1979, 1983, 1984, 2004; Speth and Parry 1978, 1980; Spielmann 1991;
Staley 1996). At some point during the Formative time frame, people on the Plains began killing bison
beyond what was required for their own subsistence and other resource needs, and traded hides, dried
meat, and perhaps other products to the more settled farmers to the west (Creel 1991; Speth 2004, 2005;
Speth and Newlander 2012; Spielmann 1991). Creel (1991) argues that this regional exchange system was
underway around or soon after A.D. 1300, with the key archaeological indicators being the appearance in
the southern Plains of numerous beveled knives and endscrapers that were used to process bison hides.
As for far west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, at present we have mostly indirect evidence as to
the role of Late Formative peoples in the Pueblo-Plains interaction sphere. Creel (1991:41) reports that
this exchange system extended all the way down to present-day Chihuahua. Occasional bison remains
also appear in Late Formative sites in the western Jornada Mogollon (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:250),
and it seems likely that bison hides (which would not show up in the faunal record) were probably traded
to the people of the El Paso phase (A.D. 1250/1300–1450). Late Formative villagers in west Texas and far
southeastern New Mexico would have been well positioned as the most likely suppliers of bison products
to the western Jornada Mogollon and settled groups further to the south. But it still remains an open
question whether, and if so to what extent, Late Formative villagers developed an export economy fueled
by bison products. Further research is needed to elucidate the details pertaining to this question.

Post-Formative (A.D. 1450–1500)
The Post-Formative begins with the widespread abandonment of late prehistoric villages in the southern
Plains around A.D. 1450, as groups throughout the region shifted to a more nomadic lifeway centered
more squarely on bison hunting (Baugh 1986; Bozell 1995; Brooks 2004; Collins 1968, 1971; Creel
1991; Dillehay 1974; Drass and Flynn 1990; Greer 1976; Hughes 1989; Jelinek 1967; Speth 1979, 1983,
1984, 2004; Speth and Parry 1978, 1980; Spielmann 1991). Archaeologically, this period is somewhat of
a phantom, as many of the diagnostic ceramic types largely disappeared along with village sites. Ceramics
are either absent in the region at this time or, to the extent they were still in use, consist of types that are
largely unknown (Katz and Katz 1993). Side-notched arrow points, similar to those that appeared after
A.D. 1200 (see above), continued into this period until an unknown date and were eventually replaced by
metal arrow points and firearms.
As part of the shift to nomadism during post-Formative times, it is reasonable to expect that tipis became
a more common dwelling form. Seymour (2002, 2004; LMAS 2001) has identified tipi rings in both the
western Jornada Mogollon and far southeastern New Mexico. She argues that tipi rings in the region are

very late in time, postdating other types of structures, and even concludes that at least some are late
nineteenth century Apache or Comanche dwellings. Such conclusions lack supporting evidence, however
(see Kenmotsu et al. 2009:96–97). Tipi rings date back several thousand years on the Plains, and it is
entirely possible that at least some tipi rings in the project vicinity predate the post-Formative time frame.
By A.D. 1500, if not earlier, people on the southern Plains had given up their attempts at village life, with
its mixed focus on farming and bison hunting, and had become nomadic, tipi-dwelling bison hunters. This
probably occurred at least in part due to increased demand from the pueblos for bison products and other
resources from the southern Plains (such as Alibates and Edwards chert). One intriguing trend that may
characterize post-Formative occupations in the region of project area is the increased use of obsidian,
most of which appears to derive from sources in northern Chihuahua and southwestern New Mexico
(Kenmotsu et al. 2009:92). This apparent trend was also noted in the Middle Pecos River valley
(northwest of the region) by Jelinek (1967). Within the project region, however, Jemez Mountain
obsidians are also found in apparent protohistoric contexts, although the source of these could actually be
Rio Grande gravels in the western Jornada Mogollon region (Stein 2011).

Pre-field Investigations
SWCA performed a cultural resources file records review on January 9, 2015, to determine whether the
project area had been previously surveyed for cultural resources and whether any archaeological sites
have been recorded in or near the project area. To conduct this review, SWCA project manager Kimberly
Parker reviewed the following 7.5-minute quadrangles at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL): Rudd Draw NE, Brunson Ranch, and Rudd Draw. In addition, the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) database and site files at TARL were also searched. These
sources provide information on the nature and location of previously conducted archaeological surveys,
previously recorded cultural resource sites, locations of National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
properties, sites designated as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), Official Texas Historical Markers,
Registered Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys. No previously
recorded cultural properties were identified.

Methods
Since all land surveyed in the Texas portion is on private land, no official state or federal permitting was
required before initiation of work. A permissions agent acquired written or verbal permission from all
landowners before survey work was conducted, allowing unrestricted passage on the proposed pipeline
route and immediately adjacent areas to define archaeological resources and reroutes to avoid those
discovered resources. Every effort was made to protect private landowner rights from trespass.

Pedestrian Survey and Field Recording
Survey and site recording were performed according to THC guidelines. A 100 percent (intensive)
cultural resources pedestrian inventory was conducted by SWCA archaeologists by walking parallel
transects spaced no more than 15 m (49 feet) apart. The survey and recording were conducted during
multiple sessions occurring between February and May 2015. Heather West, Jim Quaranta, and Andrew
Larsen served as Field Supervisors, with Eric Petersen, Scott Yost, Megan Weldy, Jordan Taher, Cody
James, and Kelton Meyer as field support.
Recording of newly discovered cultural locations was initiated with the pin-flagging of artifacts and other
cultural manifestations. Isolated manifestations (IMs) were defined by four or fewer artifacts, an isolated
feature with no potential for dating, or manifestations that were not related to other nearby IMs or sites.

Archaeological sites are defined as locations dating to an age or likely age of 50 years (pre-1965) or more
that contained five or more artifacts or as a feature or features in association with any artifacts meeting the
50-year age criterion.
For each cultural resource encountered, all surface artifacts and features were individually flagged and
recorded using a global positioning system (GPS) unit with sub-meter capabilities. For debitage,
maximum flake size in 1-cm increments (e.g., 0–1 cm, 1–2 cm, 2–3 cm, etc.), percent cortex, and material
type were recorded. For ground stone, stone-tool manufacturing artifacts, and lithic tools, type (e.g.,
mano, projectile point, core, metate, biface, etc.); maximum length, width, and thickness (in cm);
completeness (broken or complete); material; and percent cortex were recorded. Recorded ceramic
attributes included ware, type, form (e.g., bowl, jar, plate, etc.), and portion (e.g., rim, body, etc.). All
projectile points and other formal tools were photographed with a centimeter scale. Other objects,
including ceramics, bifaces, and ground stone, were representatively photographed sufficient to illustrate
assemblage diversity. No artifacts were collected during the investigation.
When 100 or fewer artifacts were observed at a site, all surface artifacts were recorded. At sites with more
than 100 artifacts, concentrations were defined and detailed information as described above was recorded
on at least 100 artifacts. Lithic tools and ground stone artifacts, as well as features, were fully recorded.
All field records from the survey are on file at SWCA’s Albuquerque office (see Management Summary
for contact information).

Shovel Tests
Prior to conducting fieldwork, Natural Resources Conservation Service (2015) soil surveys within the
project area and geologic maps were consulted in order to assess the potential for deeply buried cultural
deposits. Areas with the potential for buried deposits were identified and subsequently assessed in the
field. THC archaeological standards specify that a minimum of 16 shovel tests are required per mile
within a survey corridor of 30.5 m (100 feet). During the survey, shovel tests were conducted if there was
potential for buried cultural deposits, or if surface visibility was less than 30 percent, in accordance with
THC standards. All shovel test locations are listed in Table A.1 through Table A.7 in Appendix A.
Per THC archaeological standards, a minimum of six shovel tests are required per site to delineate site
boundaries when visibility is less than 30 percent of the total surface area. Shovel tests are implemented
in order to determine the presence or absence of buried cultural deposits deeper than 10 cm, or deeper
than depths normally accessible through trowel testing, and therefore, to support or negate
recommendations of eligibility.
The SWCA survey placed 42 shovel tests across all eight sites. Shovel tests were excavated 30 to 100 cm
below surface and were terminated when subsurface artifacts, features, or pre-Holocene sub-soils (caliche
layers) were encountered. Matrix fill was sifted through ⅛-inch mesh screen. Shovel tests were typically
not performed when the surface visibility was greater than 30 percent. Locations and results of the shovel
tests excavated within archaeological sites are included in Appendix B.
Cultural locations were described and recorded according to current archaeological standards and were
mapped with a Trimble GeoXH GPS receiver. Resource recording included preparing a plan map (postfield, using GPS data); taking site overview, feature, and artifact photographs; completing a TARL
database form; recording artifacts and features; and GPS recording resource boundaries to sub-meter
level.

Eligibility
All cultural resources were assessed for eligibility to the NRHP in part following BLM CFO resource
standards (BLM 2012) and based on the requirements of 13 TAC 26.20 and defined in 13 TAC 26.5.
These standards establish that a site is eligible when:



A radiocarbon (C14) dateable feature is present.



A dateable assemblage with proven depositional potential (buried artifacts or
features) is present.



Proven depositional potential is present (buried artifacts or features).

Recommendations for eligibility and management were made by the Principal Investigator and her staff in
consultation with the performing archaeology field crew and the field data. Reroutes were typically
established to avoid impacts to archaeological sites recommended as eligible.

FIELD SURVEY AND RESULTS
From February 23 to March 2, 17, 28, and 29, April 11–15, and May 10, 2015, SWCA archaeologists
Heather West, Eric Petersen, Scott Yost, Megan Weldy, Jim Quaranta, Jordan Taher, Cody James, and
Kelton Meyer conducted an archaeological survey of the following the staked centerline. Conditions for
the survey were good. The survey area had been moderately disturbed by road and pipeline construction
associated with oil and gas activities. Vegetation was low to moderate in occurrence, and visibility was
generally 70 to 80 percent.
Twenty-seven IMs and eight prehistoric archaeological sites were documented within the project area.
The IMs consist of prehistoric flaked stone debitage, ground stone fragments, one projectile point, firecracked rock, and a historic boundary marker. Seven of the sites are artifact scatters, and one is an artifact
scatter with an associated thermal feature. Five sites are recommended eligible for the NRHP under
Criterion D.

Site Description

Site 41LV24 is a medium-sized prehistoric artifact scatter. The site measures 53.3 × 32.7 m (175 × 107
feet) and lies within an area of coppice dunes 4 km (2.5 miles) south of Rattlesnake Flat and 0.6 km (1
mile) south of the Texas-New Mexico border (Figure 12-Figure 13). Salado Draw is 8.9 km (5.5 miles)
west-northwest and Rudd Draw is 9.0 km (5.6 miles) southeast. No topographic landmarks or features are
in proximity of the site. Vegetation is sparse; creosote bush and sand sagebrush are the dominant
vegetation. Shinnery oak and undeveloped mesquite trees are in the vicinity, along with minor grasses,
forbs, and yuccas. Ground visibility is approximately 75 percent. The topography is flat, overall, within a
large expanse of undulating dunes. The site appears to be in relatively good condition under eolian sands
and is estimated to be 75 percent intact, as no notable site disturbances can be distinguished. Cattle
grazing may have minimally impacted the site. As surface visibility was 75 percent, the site was defined
by surficial artifacts and shovel tests terminated when cultural materials were encountered. Shovel Test
Probes (STPs) 1 through 3 were excavated to a depth of 1 m (3.3 feet) (see Appendix A); STP 4 was

Features

No features were observed in the field.
Material Identified

Twelve artifacts were recorded during this investigation and include four pieces of ground stone and
seven pieces of flaked stone (Table 1). An additional piece of flaked stone debitage was encountered
during shovel testing. The flaked stone assemblage is sparse; only six chalcedony and one chert flake
were inventoried on the surface. Four are secondary flakes, displaying less than 50 percent dorsal cortex,
and four of these flakes measured less than 2 cm in length.
Four ground stone tools were identified on the site and were point located for further analysis. PL 1 is a
large, partially buried, basin metate. The large tabular sandstone basin metate was manufactured through
flaking, pecking, and grinding. Caliche formation was noted on the ground surface, suggesting it had been
horizontally buried for a period of time after deposition prior to its present, upright position (Figure 14).
PL 2 is a nearly complete tabular sandstone slab metate and was manufactured or refurbished into its
present shape through flaking and pecking along its exterior edges and was ground on one surface. The
only mano observed (PL 3) is a dolomite river cobble that exhibits grinding use wear on one surface and
possible battering along one exterior margin, indicating it was also used as a hammer stone. PL 4 is the
end section of a tan sandstone basin metate that is well ground on one surface (Figure 15).

Site Chronology

Because of the lack of diagnostic artifacts identified at the site, the cultural/temporal affiliation remains
uncertain. A Late Archaic through Early Formative period occupation would appear most likely, based on
characteristics of the artifact assemblage and particularly of the ground stone forms, but this cannot be
definitively stated.
Site Interpretation and Summary

Site 41LV24 is a medium-sized low-density prehistoric ground stone and lithic debitage artifact scatter. A
large number of ground stone items were observed, indicating food processing took place in this locale.
The limited number of flaked lithics observed in proportion to the quantity of ground stone is thought to
be a reflection of the dynamic eolian processes in this vicinity. Soil deposition is believed to have
obscured the smaller artifacts (flaked lithics), in comparison to the larger ground stone items. For
example, a flake excavated during shovel testing demonstrates that subsurface deposits are present at the
site. The site may represent a temporary or seasonal camp. The main impediment in accurately defining
the characteristics of the site and its morphology is that it appears to be mostly buried under eolian sands.
Eligibility Recommendations

SWCA recommends 41LV24 eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D. The site appears stable and in
relatively good condition and has the potential to address research domains for this region of Texas and
New Mexico. In addition, it maintains integrity of its location, setting and feeling because it is within a
coppice dune field without development in its immediate vicinity. It also maintains integrity of materials,
as evidenced by a positive shovel test and artifact assemblage. Site 41LV24 does not contain integrity of
design, workmanship, or association. THC did not concur with SWCA’s recommendation. THC
recommends that the site is undetermined and that test excavations would be needed to complete the
identification process.

Management Recommendations

Site 41LV24 is recommended eligible for the NRHP and should be avoided by all project-related
activities. Site 41LV24 is located outside the property in which construction will occur and will be
avoided by the proposed project. No further management is recommended for this resource in regard to
the present undertaking.

Site Description

Site 41LV25 is a medium-sized low-density prehistoric artifact scatter that measures 137.3 × 65.6 m (450
× 215 feet) (Figure 17-Figure 19). The site lies within an area of coppice dunes with no distinguishing
topographic or oil related features in relative proximity. Site 41LV25 is approximately 6.4 km (4 miles)
northwest of Rudd Draw and 10.1 km (6.3 miles) southeast of Salado Draw. Vegetation is sparse;
creosote bush and sand sagebrush are the dominant vegetation. Shinnery oak is in the vicinity as are small
numbers of undeveloped mesquite. Minor grasses, forbs, and yuccas are also present. Ground visibility is
approximately 75 percent. The topography appears relatively flat, overall, within a large expanse of
undulating dunes.
The site appears to be in relatively good condition, partially buried under eolian sands, and is estimated to
be 75 percent intact. The site has been impacted by a minor degree of erosion, which is noted in the
blowout areas, where artifact visibility is heightened. Its presence buried under eolian sands has likely
helped to preserve the site. There appears to be limited livestock grazing or passage through the site area.
As surface visibility was good and the site was defined by surficial artifacts; shovel tests terminated when
cultural materials were encountered (See Appendix B). STPs 1 and 2 were excavated to a depth of 1 m
(3.3 feet), and STP 3 was terminated at 30 cm with the recovery of a white chalcedony flake. Sediment
was a homogenous reddish brown to light reddish brown loose sand (5 YR 4/4–5YR 4/6, dry).

Features

No features were observed in the field.
Materials Identified

The surface assemblage of 19 artifacts was fully inventoried during this investigation, including 13 pieces
lithic debitage, one projectile point, one core, one metate, two manos, and an indeterminate ground stone
fragment. The flaked stone assemblage comprised chert, chalcedony, and quartzite materials (Table 2).
Possible use wear was noted on a number of these flakes. Core reduction is noted from the presence of the
one core, but the general lithic debitage assemblage suggests late-stage reduction. The majority of flakes
ranged in size from 0 to 3 cm, and no flakes exhibiting more than 50 percent dorsal cortex were observed.
The core measured 8 × 7 × 3.8 cm and displayed minimal cortex and at least 10 flake scars. Three
artifacts were point located. PL 1 is a complete pink chert San Jose style projectile point measuring 4.0 ×
2.0 × 0.7 cm (Figure 19). PL 2 is a large partially buried metate measuring 33 × 15 × 3.5 cm that was
manufactured through flaking, pecking, and grinding, and is moderately ground on one use surface
(Figure 20). PL 3 is a one-hand mano/expedient chopper made of sandstone, measuring 10 × 8 × 7 cm,
with grinding use wear on one surface and bifacial flaking along the margin (Figure 21). Also identified
was the medial section of an indeterminate ground stone fragment (6.6 × 5.0 × 2.7 cm), with moderate
grinding on one surface. Several fragments of possibly thermally altered rock were also observed
throughout the site but were not included in the total artifact count.

Site Chronology

The San Jose style projectile point indicates that this site was occupied at some point during the Middle or
Late Archaic periods, between B.C. 4500/3500 and 1500 (Justice 2002:133).
Site Interpretation and Summary

Based on an analysis of the artifacts present at the site, a lack of surface features, the nature of surface
deposition, and an understanding of the culture history of the project vicinity, 41LV25 is interpreted as a
short-term camp, either occupied once or intermittently over time during periods of resource procurement.
The surface assemblage indicates that tool production and resharpening took place on the site, as well as
plant resource processing and possibly hunting activities.

Eligibility Recommendations

Site 41LV25 is a Middle to Late Archaic artifact scatter with no features. The site is in overall good
condition with disturbances coming from eolian erosion and deposition. The discovery of a flake during
shovel testing indicates that the site retains information potential that might contribute to our
understanding of prehistoric lifeways in what is now Texas. Therefore, SWCA recommends 41LV25
eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D. In addition, it maintains integrity of its location, setting and
feeling because it is within a coppice dune field without development in its immediate vicinity. It also
maintains integrity of materials, as evidenced by a positive shovel test and artifact assemblage. Site
41LV25 does not contain integrity of design, workmanship, or association. THC did not concur with
SWCA’s recommendation. THC recommends that the site is undetermined and that test excavations
would be needed to complete the identification process.
Management Recommendations

SWCA recommends avoidance for site 41LV25; the proposed pipeline has been rerouted to the east of the
site so that 41LV25 will be avoided by a minimum of 30.5 m (100 feet) by all construction activities. No
further management is recommended with respect to the proposed undertaking.

Site 41LV26 is a medium-sized to large low-density prehistoric flaked stone, ceramic, and ground stone
artifact scatter with one thermal feature. The site measures 151 × 76 m (495 × 249 feet) and is situated
within an area of coppice dunes. A drill pad is approximately 0.8 km (0.5 mile) to the southeast. Salado
Draw is 10 km (6.2 miles) northwest and Rudd Draw is 5.8 km (3.6 miles) southeast. No topographic
landmarks or features are in proximity to the site. Ground visibility was approximately 75 percent.
Vegetation is sparse and no overstory is present; creosote bush and sand sagebrush are the dominant
vegetation of the understory. Shinnery oak is in the vicinity, as are small numbers of undeveloped
mesquite. Minor grasses, forbs, and yuccas are present. The topography is flat, overall, within a large
expanse of undulating dunes.
The site is in relatively good condition, estimated to be 75 percent, with eolian processes and possible
cattle grazing being the only impacts to site condition (Figure 22-Figure 23). Because surface visibility
was 75 percent, the site was defined by 12 surficial artifacts and a thermal feature (Feature 1) rather than
by shovel tests. Feature 1 was trowel scraped and was determined to have depth. Sediment at the site is a

loosely compacted reddish brown eolian loamy sand. A few thermally altered rocks were also observed
but were not included in the total artifact count.

Feature 1

Feature 1 is an amorphous, mottled area of charcoal-stained soil with a 125-cm diameter and is located at
the edge of a coppice dune (Figure 24). The stain was trowel scraped to delineate the feature in plan view.
Once the feature was defined, trowel scraping ceased. The feature is tentatively interpreted as a hearth or
other thermal activity area.

Materials Identified

The surface assemblage of 26 artifacts included flaked stone debitage and tools, ground stone, and
diagnostic ceramic sherds. Lithic debitage included 12 flakes and one piece cortical shatter. All debitage
material, excluding a single quartzite item, is chert. Approximately 77 percent of the flakes were in the 2
to 3 cm size class and the assemblage is nearly evenly split between cortical and non-cortical flakes
(Table 3). A small gray chert biface – possibly a projectile point fragment – (PL 1) measuring 1.5 × 1.0 ×
0.2 cm (base missing) was documented (Figure 25), as was a gray-brown chert flake unifacially modified
into an expedient scraper (PL 7) measuring 4.0 × 3.5 × 2.5 cm (Figure 26). The ground stone artifacts
were a basin metate fragment (PL 2), a complete slab metate (PL 3), a basin metate fragment, a one-hand
mano, and three fragments from indeterminate tools (Figure 30, Table 4). Identified ceramic types include
indeterminate brown ware (PL 4), corrugated brown ware (PL 5), and Chupadero black-on white (PL 6)
(Figure 27 - Figure 29).

Site Interpretation and Summary

Site 41LV26 is a low-density prehistoric artifact scatter with one thermal feature. The surface assemblage
indicates that tool production and resharpening took place on the site, as well as plant resource
processing, cooking and storage, and possibly hunting activities. The site is interpreted as a short-term
camp, either occupied once or intermittently over time during periods of resource procurement.
Eligibility Recommendations

Based on the intact fill present within Feature 1, SWCA recommends 41LV26 eligible for the NRHP
under Criterion D. The site appears stable and in relatively good condition and has the potential to address
research domains for this region of Texas and New Mexico. Both chronometric and subsistence data are
likely to be encountered within Feature 1 fill, which would add to our understanding of prehistoric
adaptations in the region. In addition, it maintains integrity of its location and of materials, as evidenced
by a subsurface feature and the artifact assemblage. Site 41LV26 does not contain integrity of design,
workmanship or association. Because it is just east of an established access road it does not contain
integrity of setting or feeling. THC did not concur with SWCA’s recommendation. THC recommends that
the site is undetermined and that test excavations would be needed to complete the identification process.
Management Recommendations

SWCA recommends avoidance for 41LV26; therefore, the proposed pipeline has been rerouted to the east
of the site. Site 41LV26 will be avoided by a minimum of 30.5 m (100 feet) by all construction activities.
No further management is recommended with respect to the current undertaking.

Site Description

Site 41LV27 is a large low-density prehistoric artifact scatter with two artifact concentrations around the
base and along the sides of two interconnected dune systems. The site measures 117 × 60 m (383 × 197
feet) and spans the ROW (Figure 31-Figure 32). The site is immediately west of the intersection of a
north-south-running, well-travelled caliche capped road and a road that extends east 1.2 km (0.73 mile) to
a well pad, and a large pit is 0.56 km (0.35 mile) to the south. Site 41LV27 is 5.5 km (3.44 miles)
northwest of Rudd Draw and 10.1 km (6.3 miles) southeast of Salado Draw. No topographic landmarks or
features are in proximity of the site. The dunes measure approximately 1 to 1.5 m (3.3–5 feet) high, and
the vegetative community is consistent with a desert scrubland environment and exhibits a low occurrence
of small mesquite trees, pencil cholla, yuccas, and bunch grasses. Overall ground surface visibility is
good, approximately 85 percent.

The site is in fair to good condition. It has been moderately affected by wind and minimally by water
erosion. Cattle grazing may have displaced artifacts, and the eastern portion may have been impacted by
road construction and the installation of a modern survey marker. The site was defined by 56 total
artifacts and no features. Three fragments of possible fire-cracked rock were noted but were not included
in the total artifact count. Ten STPs were excavated across the site to test depth of subsurface cultural
deposits (see Appendix B). Three STPs were placed in each artifact concentration. All probes were
excavated to a depth of 1 m (3.3 feet) through homogenous reddish brown/light reddish brown (5YR
4/4[damp]–5Y/R 6/4[dry]) moderately compacted loamy sand with 5 percent rootlets in the top 0 to 10
cm and no inclusions from 10 to 100 cm. No subsurface cultural deposits were encountered.

Features

No features were observed in the field.
Materials Identified

The majority of artifacts occur in two concentrations within blowouts along the east and west edges of the
site. The observed artifact assemblage is 56 total artifacts, the majority of which is flaked stone debitage,
with a low occurrence of ceramic sherds and ground stone artifacts. All observed artifacts were recorded
within the artifact concentrations. Artifact Concentration (AC) A is in the eastern portion of the site,
measures 16 × 12 m, and consists of 16 pieces of flaked stone debitage (Table 5). The majority of the
concentration consists of early stage reduction flakes that range in size from 2 to 5 cm long. Chert is the
dominant material type with nine chert flakes and shatter with less than 50 percent cortex. Five
chalcedony flakes with less than 50 percent or no cortex were noted. One each of mudstone and quartzite
flake with more than 50 percent cortex were inventoried.
AC B, in the western portion of the site, measures 19 × 11 m and consists of a low-density artifact scatter,
with 32 pieces of flaked stone debitage, two ceramic sherds, and six ground stone fragments. Lithic
material types are chert, chalcedony, mudstone, and quartzite (Table 5). Sixty percent of the assemblage
is non-cortical, and just under 40 percent is cortical. Debitage ranged in size class from 0 to 4 cm. The
lack of cortex and small size of the majority of flakes suggest that late stage lithic reduction activities
occurred in this location. The ground stone assemblage consists of fragments representing two
indeterminate forms. All fragments were moderately ground on one side. One piece of tan sandstone
measures 9 × 7.2 × 3.6 cm and five small pink sandstone fragments refit to measure 13 × 8 × 4 cm. Two
artifacts were point located; both are brown ware ceramic body sherds with slipped and polished
exteriors, heterogeneous sand temper, and eroded interiors (Figure 33 - Figure 34).

Site Interpretation and Summary

Site 41LV27 is a low-density prehistoric artifact scatter with no features. The surface assemblage
indicates that tool production and resharpening took place on the site, as well as plant resource processing
and cooking and storage activities. The site is interpreted as a short-term camp, either occupied once or
intermittently over time during periods of resource procurement.
Eligibility Recommendations

41LV27 is a low-density surficial artifact scatter that spans the project corridor. The artifact assemblage
consists of flaked stone debitage, two ceramic sherds, and fragments from two ground stone artifacts. Ten
negative STPs were excavated across the site indicating that subsurface deposits are unlikely. SWCA
recommends the site not eligible for the NRHP, as buried deposits are unlikely to be present and infield
analysis of the artifacts has captured the information potential of the site. Therefore, it does not maintain
integrity of materials. Although 41LV27 maintains its integrity of location, its setting and feeling has
been compromised due to its proximity to access roads and oil and gas development. In addition, it does
not contain integrity of design, workmanship, or association.
Management Recommendations

SWCA recommends no further investigations at 41LV27. However, if previously undocumented buried
cultural resources are identified during ground-disturbing activities, all work in the immediate vicinity of
the discovery should stop until the find can be evaluated by a professional archaeologist.

Site Description

Site 41LV28 is a low-density prehistoric artifact scatter measuring 257.0 × 60.3 m (843 × 198 feet)
located within a dynamic coppice dune field on a dunal ridge at an elevation above much of the
surrounding landscape. The majority of the site materials are found within blown-out portions of the site,
with dunes present around the site peripheries (Figure 35 - Figure 36). The site surface is largely free of
vegetation and approximately 75 percent of the ground surface is visible. There is no overstory vegetation
present; the sparse understory includes shinnery oak, mesquite, and sand sagebrush, with some grasses,
forbs, and plains yucca also noted. Shinnery oak is the most notable economic species represented, and
clusters or patches of this often lie near the blowout areas or artifact concentrations. The main
impediment in accurately defining the characteristics of the site is that it appears to be mostly buried
under eolian silty sand deposits.

The site is in overall good condition, estimated at 75 percent intact, with disturbance sources from
moderate eolian erosion and deposition. A small degree of grazing activity was noted. Documented
artifacts included 22 lithics, 10 ceramic sherds, and four ground stone fragments. A positive shovel test
revealed the presence of burned sandstone at a depth of approximately 30 cm below the existing ground
surface, indicating that the site retains information potential beyond the scope of this recording.

Features

No features were identified.
Materials Identified

The artifact assemblage observed at the site included 22 lithics, 10 ceramic sherds, and four ground stone
fragments. Eight lithic material types were recorded for the debitage, which included multiple varieties of
chert, chalcedony, limestone, and quartzite (Table 6). Debitage ranged in length between 0 and 5+ cm.
One unifacial limestone tool that appeared to be an expedient chopping or scraping tool was also observed
on site and recorded as PL 4. Ground stone tools included a two-hand mano fragment (PL 7), two metate
fragments (PL 3 and PL 5), and a possible digging tool (PL 6) (Table 7). Identified ceramics include
undifferentiated brown ware (PL 8), El Paso Brown ware (PL 2), and corrugated brown ware (PL 9), and
Chupadero Black-on-white (PL 1). A small quantity of fire-cracked rock was observed widely scattered
across the site surface, but these were not included in the overall artifact count. Representative

Site Chronology

The brown ware ceramics span the length of the Formative tradition from A.D. 500 to 1450. The
Chupadero black-on-white ceramics indicate that the site was likely occupied during the Late Formative
period (A.D. 1150–1450).
Site Interpretation and Summary

Based on an analysis of the artifacts present at the site, a lack of surface features, the nature of surface
deposition, and an understanding of the culture history of the project vicinity, 41LV28 is interpreted as a
short-term camp, either occupied once or intermittently over time during periods of resource procurement.

The site is in overall good condition with disturbances coming from eolian erosion and deposition. The
discovery of subsurface cultural materials during shovel testing indicates that the site retains information
potential that might contribute to our understanding of prehistoric lifeways in what is now Texas.
Therefore, SWCA recommends 41LV28 eligible for the NRHP under Criterion D. In addition, it
maintains integrity of its location, setting and feeling because it is within a coppice dune field without
development in its near vicinity. It also maintains integrity of materials, as evidenced by a positive shovel
test and the artifact assemblage. Site 41LV28 does not contain integrity of design, workmanship, or
association. THC did not concur with SWCA’s recommendation. THC recommends that the site is
undetermined and that test excavations would be needed to complete the identification process.
Management Recommendations

This site is located outside the proposed project area and will be avoided by all construction-related
activities.

Site Description

Site 41LV29 is a prehistoric artifact scatter of moderate density measuring 91.2 × 59.8 m (299 × 196 feet)
located at the southern end of an extensive coppice dune field where the topography has begun to flatten,
although the surface sediment is still predominantly wind-blown silty sand. The majority of the site
materials are found within blown-out portions of the site. The site surface is largely free of vegetation and
approximately 75 percent of the ground surface is visible (Figure 46 - Figure 47). On-site vegetation
includes shinnery oak, mesquite, and sand sagebrush, with some grasses, forbs, and plains yucca.
Shinnery oak is the most notable species represented and clusters or patches of this often lie near the
blowout areas or artifact concentrations. Portions of the site are likely buried by dunal deposition.
The site is in overall good condition, estimated at 75 percent intact, with disturbance sources from
moderate eolian erosion and deposition. A small degree of grazing activity was noted. A two-track road is
located just south of the site boundary, but has likely not impacted the site. The assemblage consists of 15
pieces lithic debitage, a few utilized/retouched flakes, a complete sandstone metate, two indeterminate
sandstone fragments, and a single brown ware ceramic. Five shovel tests were excavated at the site in
attempt to ascertain the presence of subsurface cultural deposits, but all tests were negative for cultural
remains.

Features

No features were observed at the site.
Materials Identified

The observed assemblage was fully recorded during this investigation; artifacts included 13 pieces lithic
debitage, two utilized/retouched flakes, a complete sandstone metate, two indeterminate sandstone
fragments, and a single brown ware ceramic. The 15 lithic flakes ranged in size class from 1 to 5 cm and
were of seven material types, including varieties of chert, chalcedony, and quartzite (Table 8). The
utilized flakes both exhibit unifacial wear, one on the dorsal side and one on the ventral. A complete
sandstone metate with flaked margins (PL 1) measuring 34.6 × 29.2 × 5.9 cm was observed partially
embedded in the modern ground surface (Figure 48). The grinding surface measured 20 × 12 cm. Two
additional ground stone fragments were observed on the site, but could not be identified to type. A single
brown ware sherd (PL 2) was documented (Figure 49) (Table 9).

Site Chronology

Based on the undifferentiated brown ware ceramics, this site was minimally occupied during the
Formative Period, between A.D. 500 and 1450.
Site Interpretation and Summary

Site 41LV29 is a low-density prehistoric artifact scatter with no features. The surface assemblage
indicates that tool production/resharpening took place on the site, as well as plant resource processing
activities. Cooking or storage activities are suggested by the ceramic artifact. The site is interpreted as a
short-term camp, either occupied once or intermittently over time during periods of local resource
procurement.

Eligibility Recommendations

Site 41LV29 is a low-density artifact scatter. The artifact assemblage consists of lithic and ceramic
artifacts. Five negative STPs were excavated across the site indicating that subsurface deposits are
unlikely. SWCA recommends the site not eligible for the NRHP, as buried deposits are unlikely to be
present and infield analysis of the artifacts has captured the information potential of the site. Therefore, it
does not maintain integrity of materials. Although 41LV29 maintains its integrity of location, its setting
and feeling has been compromised due to its proximity to access roads and oil and gas development. In
addition, it does not contain integrity of design, workmanship, or association.
Management Recommendations

This site is located outside the proposed project are and will be avoided by all construction-related
activities. However, because the site is recommended not eligible, no further management of this site is
recommended.

Site Description

Site 41LV30 is a small low-density prehistoric artifact scatter consisting of six lithic artifacts and three
pieces of fire-cracked rock, located within a shallow coppice dune blowout (Figure 50 - Figure 51). The
site measures 8 × 10 m (26 × 33 feet) and is located east of the proposed construction ROW. The
surrounding topographical setting consists of larger undulating dunes with low-density vegetation
composed of mesquite, forbs, shinnery oak, perennial flowers, and bunch grasses. 41LV30 is
approximately 8.9 km (5.5 miles) east/southeast of Salado Draw. Overall ground surface visibility is
good, approximately 75 percent.
The site is in fair condition, estimated to be between 30 and 50 percent intact. It has been moderately
affected by eolian erosion and minimally by alluvial erosion. The site is likely deflated. The observed
artifact assemblage is composed of six artifacts including a tested cobble, a chopper, a hammerstone, and
three pieces of indeterminate ground stone. Four STPs were excavated across the site to test for intact
subsurface cultural deposits (Table 10). All probes were excavated to a depth of 60 cm through
homogenous reddish brown/ light reddish brown (5YR 4/4[damp]–5Y/R 6/4[dry]) loosely compacted
loamy sand. Roots were visible from 0 to 40 cm and rabbit droppings were visible in the first 20 cm. No
subsurface cultural deposits were encountered.

Site Chronology

Because of the lack of diagnostic artifacts identified at the site, the cultural/temporal affiliation remains
uncertain. The site is assigned an unspecified prehistoric cultural and temporal affiliation.
Site Interpretation and Summary

Site 41LV30 is a small low-density prehistoric artifact scatter with no features. The surface assemblage
indicates that tool production/resharpening took place on the site, as well as plant resource processing
activities. The site is interpreted as a short-term camp, either occupied once or intermittently over time
during periods of local resource procurement.
Eligibility Recommendations

41LV30 is a low-density surficial artifact scatter. The artifact assemblage consists of flaked stone tools,
ground stone fragments, and three pieces of fire-cracked rock. Four negative STPs were excavated across
the site, indicating that subsurface deposits are unlikely. SWCA recommends the site not eligible for the
NRHP, as buried deposits are unlikely to be present and infield analysis of the artifacts has captured the
information potential of the site. Therefore, it does not maintain integrity of materials. Although 41LV230
maintains its integrity of location, setting and feeling, it does not contain integrity of design,
workmanship, or association.
Management Recommendations

No further management is recommended for this resource.

Site Description

This site is a large low-density prehistoric artifact scatter that measures 84.4 × 63.5 m (277 × 208 feet). It
is on and around a series of small coppice dunes. Artifacts are mostly located in blowout areas.
Vegetation is moderate and consists of scrub mesquite, shinnery oak, yuccas, small forbs, perennial
wildflowers, and sparse bunch grasses. Salado Draw is located approximately 7.2 km (4.5 miles) westnorthwest of the site. The site is in good condition with 60 to 80 percent buried under dunes. It has been
moderately affected by wind and minimally by water erosion. Bioturbation in the forms of livestock
grazing and burrowing animals is also present (Figure 54 - Figure 55).
The site is in fair to good condition, estimated to be 60 to 80 percent intact with the major site
disturbances from eolian deposition and erosion, cattle grazing, and bioturbation in the form of small
rodent or mammal burrows. The artifact assemblage on the site consists of 14 pieces lithic debitage, two
ceramic vessel fragments, a mano fragment, and three pieces of indeterminate ground stone. Seven shovel
tests were excavated to determine if intact subsurface cultural materials are present; three were positive
for cultural remains, indicating that the information potential of the site is not fully captured by this
recording.

Features

No features were observed.
Materials Identified

This site is a large low-density artifact scatter with 15 pieces of lithic debitage, two ceramic sherds, a
mano fragment, and three pieces of indeterminate ground stone (Table 11 - Table 12). Ground stone
fragments were located in low blowout areas. Chert is the dominant lithic material type followed by
quartzite, chalcedony, and sandstone. The majority of flakes have no cortex. Tools include only a gray
sandstone chopper (PL 3) that is flaked on all sides. The chopping edge of PL 3 has been bifacially
worked and shows use wear (Figure 56). Four ceramic sherds were identified and include two brown ware
jar sherds (PL 1 and PL 2, Figure 57) and two pieces of brown ware from indeterminate vessels (PL 4).
PL 1 and PL 2 are unslipped jar vessel sherds, possibly El Paso Brown, with carbon streaking and a
chunky heterogeneous quartz sand temper. PL 4 includes two sherds with carbon streaking and a chunky
heterogeneous quartz sand temper (digital files corrupted, photographs are not available).

undetermined and that test excavations would be needed to complete the identification process.

Management Recommendations
SWCA recommends avoidance for 41LV31; therefore, the proposed pipeline has been rerouted to the east
of the site. Site 41LV31 will be avoided by a minimum of 30.5 m (100 feet) by all construction activities.
No further management is recommended with respect to the current undertaking.

DISCUSSION
An archaeological survey of an 804.66 acres for the Sunoco Delaware Basin Pipeline on private land in
Texas resulted in the discovery of eight sites, five of which are considered eligible for the NRHP
(41LV24, 41LV25, 41LV26, 41LV28, and 41LV31), and 27 IMs. Sites 41LV27, 41LV29, and 41LV30
and the IMs are not eligible for the NRHP.
Sites 41LV24, 41LV25, 41LV26, 41LV28, and 41LV31 are all considered eligible for the NRHP under
Criterion D, as all likely contain buried deposits that have research potential to address research domains
for this area in Texas and New Mexico. Specifically these sites have the potential to yield information that
would aid in understanding prehistoric mobility and subsistence strategies in the area.

Management Summary
This cultural resources survey investigated eight newly recorded prehistoric cultural properties. Twentyseven IMs were also discovered during this investigation, scattered along the survey area.
Five of the newly recorded sites—41LV24, 41LV25, 41LV26, 41LV28, and 41LV31—are recommended
eligible for the NRHP. All eligible sites have been avoided by surveyed reroutes and no further
management is recommended.
The three remaining sites—41LV27, 41LV29, and 41LV30—are recommended not eligible for the NRHP
and no further management for these sites is recommended. The 27 IMs are not eligible for the NRHP. No
further management of these resources is recommended. SWCA recommends that the proposed project
will have No Adverse Effect on historic properties and that it be allowed to proceed as planned. Site
summaries, eligibility, and mitigation recommendations are provided below in Table 14.
