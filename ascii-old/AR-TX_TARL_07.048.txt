The Texas Archeological Survey (TAS) has conducted a
cultural resource survey and testing program along the route
of the Fayetteville to Glidden transmission line, across portions
of Fayette and Colorado counties. These investigati~ns were
initiated at the request of the Lower Colorado River Authority
(LCRA) for the purpose of inventory and evaluation of cultural
sites endangered by the anticipated construction. Investi­
gations were authorized under Permit No. 252, issued to the
lCRA by the Texas Antiquities Committee.
The field survey was initiated in January of 1981.
Since all easement acquisitions had not been completed at
the inception of this project, the archeological investiga­
tions of newly-leased or newly-condemned lands proceeded on
an intermittent basis until testing was completed in April
of 1981. Concurrent with these investigations, the archeol­
ogists were involved with construction monitoring activities
and in-field counsel to LCRA personnel throughout the dunation
of the project. Field work was conducted by Bruce A. Nightengale,
Leland C. Bement, Jeff Girard, and Susan Lisk under ·the super­
vision of Ray D. Kenmotsu. All phases of the work were over­
seen by the Principal Investigator, David S. Dibble, who
provided additional in-field assessment.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The LCRA transmission line corridor extends over portions
of east-central Fayette and north-central ColoradocouJlties ..
The narrow corridor is17 mi.1eslong by 75 ft. wtde; it passes
through 2 .6 mil esof Fayette County and 13.7 roil es of Colorado
County. Commencing at State Highway 159 northeast of

2

Fayetteville, the line extends southeastward along the middle
and lower margins of the Colorado River Basin, crossing the
major terraces and flood plain of the Colorado, and connects
with the existing terminus in Glidden, due west of Columbus.
The study area is located marginal to southeast Central Texas
and the inner Gulf Coast. Elevations range from 200 feet
above mean sea level along the ch'annel of the' ColQ'ra,do
River to 380 feet atop the cuestas and rolling hills of the
western basin margin. In this study the basin margin, partly
formed from old Colorado River terrace remnants (Bailey 1923),
is at times referred to as "uplands" due to its elevation
relative to the present flood plain and younger terraces.
The general topography is characterized by rolling up­
lands and flat lowlands, moderately dissected by small streams
of the Colorado system. From north to south, the transmission
line route traverses the older, more dissected uplands and
ancient terraces, then extends across the younger fluvial
deposits nearer the present watercourse.
Geologic formations underlying the route of the trans­
mission line are primarily Quaternary units; Pleistocene
gravels, sands, and clays are exposed in the upper reaches
with Holocene alluvium found along the course of the Colorado
River and its major tributaries. These deposits are formed
in flood plain and fluviatile terrace deposits associated with
the development of the Colorado River system. Within this
study area, the principal geologic outcrop dominating the
basin margin is the Early Pleistocene Willis Formation
(Barnes 1974). Most of the transmission line is routed over
this geologic exposure of·mottled, deeply weathered clay

and gravel, with locally abundant iron oxide concretions.
Accumulations of large surface gravels, related to the Uvalde
Gravels (Byrd 1971), are evident throughout the upland segment
of this survey. These rounded to irregularly-angled cobbles~
slabs, and fragments of chert and quartzite line the bottoms
of upland drainages and are exposed on surfaces of slopes
and ridges. These lag deposits would have been potential
sources of lithic raw materials.
Major division of the study area physiography can be
made between upland localities and flood plain, riverine
environments. Distinctions in river terrace structure have
been deliniated (Bailey 1923), which account for the siliceous
coarse sands generally found below elevations of 250 feet.
Sandy alluvial units also occur in the upland localities
but these are attributable to upland Holocene drainages.
Most of the observed variation in terrain feature is
found in the higher elevations of the study area. Dissection
of the basin margin by stream-bed incision has resulted in
local diversity of landform. The principal features associated
with the uplands provide a b~sis on which to pattern the
local environment. These include the alluvial environments
associated with upland ephemeral creeks and tributaries and
the fluvial divides which serve to separate the various
drainage systems.
The fluvial divides are characterized by cuestas and small
hills which vary in relief, areal extent, and surface slope.
Where rounded hills or declining, convex surfaces occur, the
surface soils have eroded to expose underlying clays and
gravels. These surfaces are often marred by narrow, shallow
rills.

5

Along the margins of ephemeral creeks and tributaries,
alluvial accumulations of deep sand and sandy loam have been
deposited during periods of excessive stream discharge. The
terraces form adjacent to the drainage edge and below the
sloping margins of the fluvial divides. Although permanent1y­
flowing creeks drain through the uplands proximal to the
transmission line corridor, the study route does not intersect
with these bodies of water.
All of the surface drainages in the study area are part
of the Colorado River system. The Colorado is the principal
watercourse through this region and all of the upland tribu­
taries of the study area flow south and east, ultimately into
this drainage. Most of the upland watersheds encountered
along the transmission line route serve as minor secondary
and tertiary feeders to Cummins Creek. This south-flowing
creek drains the uplands and Quaternary terraces and serves
as a major tributary to the Colorado. Sloping, peninsular
projections grade with alluvial terrace deposits where re­
working of upland materials have contributed to the terrace
bed sediments. In some instances, upland drainages exhibit
no terracing and shallow to moderately deep t~oughs hav~
formed in the exposed upland clays. The large, surface gravel
cobbles have often eroded into these troughs to form localized
accumulations.
SOILS AND VEGETATION
Climate exerts primary control on soils genesis and
plant distribution. Additionally. the geology and local topo­

6

graphy greatly influence the nature of soil distribution and
attributes in this region. A brief overview of the major
soil groups provides a generalized framework for understanding
the soil-landform relationships.
The major soil group crossed by the transmission line is
represented by the Tremona-Straber Association (Soil Conser­
vation Service 1978). The soils of this association are
Paleustalfs. reddish Alfisols of warm subhumid regions (Soil
Survey Staff 1975). These soils may possess an illuviated
clay horizon, subject to expansion and contraction with
subsequent soil mixing. This association is primarily of
upland soils which dominate the ridgetops and slopes. These
soils may be characterized as nearly level to sloping with
light brown loamy fine sand surface horizon overlying a grey­
red mottled subsoil.
In level upland areas situated between widely spaced
drainage systems. these soils have been subject to extensive
clearing, commercial gravel quarrying. and long-term ranching
and farming.
of the surface horizon has eroded along the fluvial
divides leaving thin veneers of sandy materials or exposures
of subsurface clays and gravels. Variation in soil type 1s
in part attributable to the local variations in upland topo­
graphy. Where creeks drain the uplands. thick lenses of sandy
alluvium overlie the dissected clay beds and contrast with
the adjacent slopes and hilltops. Tbese sandy horizons are
particularly subject to heavy root and rodent disturbances.
Mu~h

7

Soils of the Colorado River flood plain and adjacent
terraces are influenced by the fluctuations in flow and course
of the river. Alluvial materials of the broad flood plain
soils are primarily thick clayey sediments common to many
major streams draining the coastal plain. This soil is
typified by the Brazoria Series of the fine, montmorillonitic,
thermic family of Typic Chromuderts. These are basically
dark, reddish-brown to reddish-gray clays with nearly level
surfaces. Sticky and plastic when wet and of subangu1ars
blocky structure when dry, these soils are subject to severe
shrink and swell mixing. Land use common to these locales
centers around agricultural activities.
Overlooking and adjacent to these clayey flood plains,
terrace formations of deep, sandy alluvium have developed.
Where the transmission line crosses these formations, these
represent the fourth terraces of the Colorado River. These
terraces may not have been subject to river overflow in recent
times and may have been deposited in the Late Pleistocene
(Bailey 1923).
Most closely related to the post oak region of Texas
(Gould 1969) and the oak-hickory region of Tharp (1939), the
area traversed by the transmission line has undergone substantial
modification from historic and present land use. Burmuda­
grass rangelands and agricultural fields have replaced the
original vegetation forms although some remnant woodland
populations persist.
Major native assemblages encountered along the route
of the study reflect a general homogeneity across the entire

8

area. Perhaps as a result of land use, the remnant oak wood­
lands have been invaded by thick understories of yaupon
(IZex vomitoria) which restrict agricultural and other uses
of the land. In upland areas undeveloped by agriculture and
commercial quarrying, this oak-yaupon association dominates
along slopes, ridges, and upland drainage margins.
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Fayette and Colorado counties lie along the periphery
of the cultural regions of Central Texas, East Texas, and
the Upper Coast. Material remains of prehistoric sites found
in this region may not exhibit traits strictly attributable
to any given cultural tradition. The problem of regionaliza­
tion for this area was reviewed by Skelton (1977) whose work,
along with others (Honea 1961; Peterson 1965; Meier and
Hester 1972; and Fullem 1977), is somewhat supportive of
contact relations between inland and bordering groups.
Generally, however, the materials recovered from prehistoric
sites in Fayette County tend to be more closely associated
with the Central Texas archeological region. Typological
comparisons of diagnostic artifatts recovered from extensive
excavations in Fayette County (Skelton 1977) have geographically
broadened the Central Texas chronologic framework of Weir
(1976) and Prewitt (1974, 1976) to include Fayette County.
Additionally, Fullem (1977), after examining artifacts from
the Black Hopper site in Fayette County, has suggested a pre­
dominant Central Texas cultural affiliation. although he
points out that the influence of adjoining cultural regions
is made apparent by the occurrence of East Texas indicators
and in the blending of stylistic traits of the Archaic materials.

9

Thus far, work in Colorado County has not provided sufficient
information· to allow for substantive treatments relating
cultural sites to regional traditions. It is reasonable to
assume that mixed traits may be exhibited by material
assemblages recovered from this area.
LOCAL WORK
Several reconnaissance level surveys have been conducted
in portions of Fayette and Colorado counties. but few intensive,
systematic investigations have been undertaken. The earliest
work in Fayette County consisted of archeological survey along
the central Colorado River (Wilson 1930). This survey provided
a first approximation of the cultural resources, but site
documentation was somewhat scant. No systematic survey was
resumed until Nunley (1963) surveyed the area to be affected
by the proposed Columbus Bend Reservoir in Fayette and Colorado
counties. Of the thirty-eight sites located in Fayette County,
fifteen exhibit probable Archaic and/or Late Prehistoric
components. The Archaic sites were restricted to upland
contexts while the latter sites occurred in both upland and
terrace locations. Later in the decade, an aboriginal cemetery
was excavated in association with a Late Prehistoric artifact
assemblage at the Frisch Auf! site (Hester and Collins 1969).
Evidence of Pa1eoindian occupation in the area is largely
restricted to isolated surface finds, although investigations
at the Meier site (Meier and Hester 1972) have yielded a
Pa1eoindian component,and work at the Little Pin Oak Creek
site (Wilson 1979) may indicate more extensive Paleoindian
activities.

10

A systematic program of surface survey, subsurface testing,
and· excavation was carried out by the Texas Archeological
Survey at the Fayette Power Plant. The survey recorded
nineteen prehistoric and twelve historic sites (Jackson and
Skelton 1975), of which six prehistoric (1977) and three
historic sites (Carter and Ragsdale 1976) were subsequently
tested. In Fayette County, other investigations have included
survey and testing by the Texas Highway Department, (Keller
1974; Ful1em 1977), the TAS (Dibble and Freeman 1970; Brown
and Kenmotsu 1980), and Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Laurens,
Guy, and Prewitt 1979).
In Colorado County, Nunley's (1963) work provides the
only systematic survey undertaken in Colorado County. Most
of the Colorado County sites located in his work were situated
in the uplands or Quaternary terraces along the margins of
the lower-lying flood plain and Colorado River channel.
Although regional affiliations of the sites were unclear,
nine Archaic, one Late Prehistoric~ and four possible Paleo­
indian sites were identified. Other work in the county
consisted of sporadic, isolated site recordings or recon­
naissance level surveys by amateur or professional archeologists.
Subsurface investigations of cultural sites in this county
are restricted to an early excavation of the Hugh Wilson
site (41 CD 37). located about 5 miles south-southeast of
Columbus. This work was done by A.M. Woolsey and a group
from the University of Texas. Excavations resulted in the
exposure and removal of thirteen burials, with several additional
skeletal remains noted but left unexcavated. No artifacts
indicating cultural affiliation of this site were noted in
the available records.

11

METHODS
Prior to field aspects of the projects an archival examina­
tion was conducted to locate any recorded cultural sites within
the transmission line route. A review of pertinent materials
on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)s
the University of Texas at Austins revealed that no known
sites existed within the proposed corridor.
Field survey of the transmission line corridor was initiated
prior to the completion of easement acquisitions by the LCRA.
This necessitated archeological survey of newly-condemned or
newly-leased lands on an intermittent basis. Coverage of
the 75-foot-wide corridor was accomplished by means of meandering
serpentine transects. Upon locating sites s site assessment
efforts were augmented by a combination of surface inspection
and small s subsurface shovel probes.
Site documentation was maintained using standard University
of Texas site survey forms. The locations and boundaries
of the sites were plotted on 1 :2400 aerial photo mosaics pro­
vided by the LCRA and on U.S.G.S. 7.5 topographic quadrangles.
These site plottings were reported to the LCRA s for inclusion
on their engineering and construction plats, and to the records
division of TARL.

All materials and site documentation are housed at the
TARL, University of Texas at Atistin, where all sites are
assigned permanent trinomial designators. These trinomials
consist of a numerical state code (Texas=4l), an abbreviated
county indicator (Colorado=CD), and a numerical site index

12

,
(site=80) representing the order in which the site was recorded
in the county.
In addition to the survey, the archeologists were involved
with construction monitoring activity and in-field counsel to
LCRA personnel. Concurrent with corridor centerline clearing
operations which took place only in areas surveyed by the
archeologists and considered not to be culturally sensitive,
recommendations were made for immediate further evaluation of
potentially significant sites endangered by the effects of
clearing, or threatened by succeeding phases of construction.
When the archeological survey had located a site of potential
investigative interest, the LCRA field personnel were notified
of its location and advised to avoid the site area until
appropriate evaluative procedures had been implemented.
Depending upon the extent of private landowner cooperation,
additional mitigative procedures were utilized to minimize
adverse construction-related effects. This involved LCRA
personnel chain-sawing and winching trees off the site area
under the supervision of TAS archeologists.
RESULTS
Archeological field investigations were oriented toward
the location and evaluation of cultural resources. Ten pre­
historic sites were recorded in or near the transmission line
corridor. Nine of these sites are located in Colorado County
and one is in Fayette County. All cultural localities found
on this survey were considered of "site" status regardless of
density of materials. Singl e,1501 a 'lad finds of cultural
materials (41 CD 78, 41 CD 84) have received site designation.

13

Limited shovel probes were used to augment site recognition
efforts and to assist in the deliniation of site attributes.
General observations of site condition, function and type
as related to physiographic features may be more apparent
than real. However, certain relationships between these vari­
ables appear to be consistently demonstrated by sites found
during this survey. All of the sites situated on sandy alluvial
terraces along the margins of ephemeral upland watercourses
are lithic scatters or lithic/burned rock scatters. Such sites
are generally considered short-term encampments which evidence
the intermittent exploitation of upland resources. Of the ob­
served cultural materials from these sites, all appear to be
of locally available materials; large chert cobbles often occur
in the beds of the upland watercourses or may be obtained from
surface accumulations on relatively near~by hills. Five sites
(4·1 CD 76, 41 CD 79, 41 CD 80, 41 CD 81, and 41 FY 196} are
__ ~~!~__san~l alluvial terraces.______
Surface sites found in upland areas along the crests
and slope margins of fluvial divides between upland water­
sheds appear to be oriented to lithic procurement. Two sites
(41 CD 77, 41 CD 82) can be characterized by surface occurrences
of cores, core remnants, and primary reduction debris in
association with large accumulations of unmodified chert
cobbles. Cultural materials on these sites have been severely
displaced due to natural processes of surface degradation and
erosion of clay-based materials. As well, clearing activities
associated with ranch road construction and rangeland develop­
ment have further affected the cultural integrity of these
sites.

14

One site, 41 CD 83, is situated along the edge of an
extensive, sandy, river terrace overlooking the broad. Colorado
River flood plain. The terrace deposit is not associated
with any present upland drainage and may be directly related
to the Colorado River flood plain and channel morphology
(Looney 1975).
Of the ten prehistoric sites identified, two sites l4l CD
80, 41 CD 83) were recommended for subsurface examination.
Both of these sites exhibited sufficient potential to warrant
further evaluation and were threatened by the activities
associated with transmission line construction.
SITES TESTED
Recommendations for immediate, subsurface evaluation of
cultural sites, 41 CD 80 and 41 CD 83, were made for the purpose
of determing nature, structural condition, and interpretive
potential of the portions of these sites subject to antici­
pated damages from unavoidable construction activities.
Investigations at these sites were wholly restricted to the
endangered deposits contained within the transmission line
right-of-way.
Testing procedures at 41 CD 80 consisted of backhoe
trenching with the intent of ascertaining the presence, nature,
and condition of the cultural deposit. The LCRA provided
the backhoe and personnel to perform any necessary brush clearing
and backfilling. At 41 CD 83, testing consisted of hand
excavated test pits placed in areas of the site critically
endangered by unavoidable construction. Efforts were focused
on the proposed tower location which would receive the primary
impact.

15

Prior to completion of the test procedure at 41 CD 83,
the LCRA expressed a need to clear the site of existing trees
and brush. Under mutual agreement, this was accomplished by
means of chain-saw clearing and winching of trees from the
site surface. This effectively reduced the extent of potential
damage to the ~site ~_nd 'enabled the archeologists"-.and the
LCRA to resume their respective work without undue inter­
ference.
41 CD 83
Located 0.9 mile northeast of Glidden and 2.1 miles west­
northwest ~f Columbus in Colorado County, site 41 CD 83 is
situated on the northern margin of a sandy river terrace and
overlooks the wide flood plain of the Colorado River. The
surface of the terrace is generally level with its northern
slope margin declining toward and grading with the presently
cultivated flood plain. The site is generally open with a
few live oaks and clumps of yaupon scattered over the site.
Cultural materials are lightly distributed over the site
surface and are best exposed in the mounds of rodent backdirt
found across the site. Depth to the cultural deposit at this
site was initially revealed by shovel probes performed within
the transmission line corridor. The proposed plans to erect
a large transmission tower directly on the site prompted the
initi~tion of testing procedures.
The terrace on which 41 CD 83 is situated consists of
deep sandy materials which may have been deposited during an
early developmental stage of the Colorado River system. The
elevation of the terrace, 225 feet, places it well above the

present, periodically inundated flood plain. The terrace was
not even affected by overflow during the great floods of 1913
(Bailey 1923) and 1935 (Naumann, personal communication)
which inundated the third terrace of the Colorado River.
Testing Methods
Test excavations were initiated with the establishment
of a site grid oriented to magnetic north. A marker placed
by LCRA surveyors to denote the center of the tower position
served as both the primary transit station and the N100 W100
grid point. Providing a reference for vertical control of
excavation levels, measured by rod and transit, this datum
served as an arbitrary 100 meter vertical elevation point.
The locations of the excavation units were based upon
several factors. These included the information gathered
through the survey assessment of the site, which had indicated
local subsurface concentrations of lithic materials, the
configuration of subtle surface relief within the confines
of the right-of-way, and the need to thoroughly assess and
evaluate the cultural deposits directly threatened by the
construction of the tower.
Five 1 x 1 meter test pits were excavated in 20 cm.
levels. With shovel and trowel the matrix was shaved through
each level and sifted through \-inch mesh screens, and all
recovered cultural materials were bagged and labelled.
Additional field procedures conducted during the test excava­
tions included the preparation of a site field map and the
profiling of test pit walls.

18

Results of Testing
The present field investigation revealed a deep~ mixed
sandy terrace deposit containing the residues of a probable
short-term campsite devoted to a limited range of activities.
Most of the cultural material recovered (Table 1) was debitage ­
small waste chips and tertiary flakes - which suggests workshop
activities related to the final stages of lithic reduction or
possibly stone tool maintenance. The absence of an on-site
source of lithic raw material would necessitate transport of
raw materials into the site. The few core fragments and ex­
hausted cores found seem to indicate thorough use of these
materials. Such raw materials were certainly available in
exposed contexts on the higher terraces and in upland evniron­
ments, but there was no readily-available~ local source of
such stones.
The site exhibited substantial mixing of the cultural
deposit and no discrete cultural components could be defined.
Cultural features, if present~ have been obliterated by the
excessive rodent activity which was evidenced by the networks
of gopher runs encountered in vertical and horizontal exposures.
The absence of diagnostic materials, the lack of any
obvious exploitable resources, and the mixed condition of the
site are problematic to assessments of site use through time
and of length of occupation. The general lack of variability
in the recovered collection suggests a limited function for
the si.te, or use over a fairly short period of time, or
perhaps both.

The overall findings of this investigation do not evidence
a significant loss of information as a result of tower con­
struction on this portion of the site. Additional study within
this area of construction is not warranted.
41 CD 80
,

Located 6 ndles east-southeast of Ellinger and 5 miles
southwest of Fre1sburg, site 41 CD 80 occupies an extensive
alluvial terrace developed along the north and west sides
of an unnamed, ephemeral tributary to Cummins Creek. Surface
occurrences of lithic debitage and burned rock fragments are
evident across a large area of about 150 by 200 meters; the
site boundaries roughly correspond to the limits of the terrace.
The site is situated amidst a dense thicket of yaupon which
dominates the understory of a scattered oak woodland.
Portions of the site, primarily along its northernmost
extension, have been obliterated by former clearing of a fire­
break through the dense vegetation. The firebreak is oriented
generally east to West and is approximately 30 meters wide.
Rodent and armadillo burrowing is evident in the sandy soils
and has contributed to the site disturbances. Lithic debitage

area of this clearing.
The major portion of the site to the south remains in
yaupon and oak cover. This area of the site extends about
100 meters north to south, from the edge of the firebreak
to the steep banks of a meandering, deeply incised channel.
Although surficially exposed artifacts are scanty due to ground

surface concealment by heavy leaf litter, chert debitage and
burned rock fragments were recovered in routine shovel probes.
The soils consist of a sandy to sandy loam surface matrix
which varies in depth (20 - 60 cm.) and overlies a clay sub­
surface horizon. Surface topography of the site area contained
within the transmission line is generally level with some
relief noted as one moves south to north toward a slight rise.
The transmission line corridor crosses a narrow portion of
this site.
Although no discrete concentrations of cultural materials
were encountered in the shovel probes performed within the
transmission line corridor, the extensive damage anticipated
as a result of clearing activities prompted immediate further
investigations at this site.
Testing Methods
Given the nature of information gathered through the
survey assessment of the site, subsurface evaluations were
initiated through machine (backhoe) trenching. Given the
length of the transmission line through the wooded portion of
the site, it was determined that several trenches, dug at
varying intervals within the transmission line corridor,
would be required to properly ascertain the nature and condi­
tion of any cultural deposits. Any exposure of discrete
cultural assemblages, features, or intact stratigraphit_cultural
deposits would prompt additional, intensive hand-excavations.
Recommendations for the initiation of trenching activities
were made to the LCRA officials who promptly provided a backhoe
and personnel to perform any necessary brush clearing and back­
filling.

24

Given the limited extent of the site in which the archeol­
ogists were permitted to work, a site grid was not established
for the trenching procedure. Exact mapping of all trenches
in relation to the transmission line was performed, however.
using this corridor centerline as a base grid line. All
work was restricted to the wooded portion of the site, since
it had not been as severely disrupted as the part within the
firebreak.
The location and orientation of the trenches was decided
on the basis of the slight, but apparent, relief of the terrace
within the line corridor. Trenches were positioned at varying
intervals on the gentle grade sloping upward from the southern
edge of the site at the drainage bank toward a small, sandy
rise to the north. A total of five trenching locations were
selected. Documentation of the trenching procedure consisted
of profile sketches and descriptions of the trench walls, and
the recording of all pertinent observations. Additionally,
cultural materials recovered through the trenching operation
were collected in labelled bags.
Results of Trenching
Exposure and examination of the site subsurface indicated
a diffuse and severely mixed cultural deposit contained wholly
within the sandy alluvial surface horizons. The nature of
the cultural materi~ls (a few burned rock fragments and some
debitage), and the severely mixed condition of the deposits
evidenced the limited interpretive value of this portion of
the site.

25

Although based solely upon subjective observations of
the cultural materials recovered from this testing procedure,
it seems plausible that the relatively large size of the
flakes recovered is attributable to the early-stage reduction
in stone tool manufacture.
Such an interpretation of limited function is admittedly
tenuous, since the lack of variability in type and dimension
of artifacts recovered may be a result of the site's mixed
con d i t i. 0 n, 0 r 0 f we a k ne sse s ; nth e t est i'n 9 pro c e d ur e .
Aside from any alluvial redeposition of cultural materials,
the most apparent factor contributing to the destruction of
features and the. mixing ()f the cultural materials was the
massive network of roots from the yaupon and oak components
of the woodland. Although it is likely that these effects
would be partially evident in certain other areas of the site.
the extensive size of the entire site and the limited areal
extent of this investigation render unfounded any disregard
for future investigations at this site.
It should not be considered that the investigative
potential of this site has been thoroughly exhausted, as few
sites of such size have been identified in upland terrace
contexts in this region. Future investigations at this site
are necessary should an expansion or intensification of
potentially disruptive construction activity be initiated.
However, additional investigation or intensive mitigation of
the portion of the site within the transmission corridor is
not warranted.

26

ADDITIONAL SITES
Additional cultural sites were located during the survey.
Most of these sites had been severely disturbed by erosion
and/or local land management practices. These sites or those
portions of these sites which occurred within the right-of­
way did not retain sufficient structural integrity or the
discrete artifact assemblages warranting additional investiga­
tion.
41 CD 76
Located 4.7 miles west of Frelsburg and 3.5 miles south­
east of Fayetteville, this small campsite occupies a sandy
alluvial terrace of Bull Creek~ an east-flowing tributary
of Cummins Creek. The terrace has developed along the northern
margin of the creek, on the outer bank of a broad meander of
that intermittent, upland stream. Bordering the eastern
perimeter of the site, a sballow unnamed drainage cuts through
the terrace fill and meanders toward the main channel. Large
gravel cobbles are exposed in the beds of this shallow drain­
age and of Dry Creek.
The soil at the surf~ce of the site is a ~elatively
shallow (-30 em.) sandy loam which overlies a dark brown
clay subsurface. The soils support a small woodland population
of post oak with a moderately heavy yaupon understory.
Cultural materials consist of a light scatter of lithics
and burned rock fragments. Shovel probes indicate that the
subsurface materials are scant and occur primarily along the

27

western perimeter of the site. A narrow remnant of the site
extends to the south-east directly along an old fencerow
which fringes the southern edge of the terrace directly above
the steep bank of the Dry Creek channel. Some cultural
materials were found eroded from the narrow strip along the
fencerow and redeposited on the steep sloping cutbank.
The transmission line corridor crosses the eroded, south­
eastern extension of the site along the fencerow. No systemat­
ic investigation of this construction-affected segment is
warranted.
41 CD 77

Located 4.7 miles west of Frelsburg and 3.8 miles south­
east of Fayetteville, the site is situated on the crest of an
eroded cuesta or fluvial divide which separates the Dry Creek
and Bee Creek watersheds. To the north the site overlooks
the Dry Creek flood plain, which abuts the toeslope of the
steep northern slope of the cuesta.
Headward erosion is evident across a major portion of
the site; deep (2.5 meter] runoff drainages have eroded through
the central portion of the site. This erosional activity
has been accelerated by recent clearing of wooded cover and
by the construction of a corral on the western sector of the
site. A small remnant of oak-cedar thicket occurs on the
southern edge of the si.te and a few cedar trees fringe the
slope margins.

28

Cultural materials are thinly distributed across the
site surface and are interspersed amongst numerous naturally­
occurring gravel cobbles. Most of the cultural materials
related to the procurement of raw materials and the early
stages of tool manufacture; a few cores and core fragments,
large primary and secondary flakes, and two thick core bifaces
were noted in the bed of the deep runoff drainage. Other
materials are all surface-exposed and no depth to the site
is. indicated.
The extensive disturbances caused by erosion and land
use practices have severely limited the investigative poten­
tial of this site. No additional work is warranted.
41 CD 78

Located 4.5 miles west of Frelsburg and 1.3 miles east
of Rocky Hill School, this isolated artifact was found on the
crest of a hill north of Stein Branch Creek, an intermittently­
flowing upland drainage. The single secondary flake of light­
brown chert was situated amidst a thinly-soiled, oak-cedar
woodland which had been partially cleared for firewood by
landowners. No additional work is warranted at this site.
41 CD 79

Located 4.5 miles west of Fre1sllurg and 1.3 mi.les east
of Rocky Hill School, this site occupies a small, open terrace
knoll north of and directly overlooking Stein Branch Creek.
The site area has been cleared of its former oak-cedar cover
and has been developed for grazing.

29

Secondary chert flakes are lightly distributed along the
gently sloping southern edge of the knoll t and are restricted
to surface scatter. No depth to the cultural deposit was
reveal ed by shovel probes of the area.
The site occurs about 150 meters south of the isolated
find at 41 CD 78 and lies just outside of the western limit
of the transmission line boundaries. No damage to this site is
anticipated as a result of the utility construction.
41

CD 81

Located 6.2 miles south-southwest of Frelsburg and 7.1
miles east-southeast of Ellinger, site 41 CD 81 1s sftDated on
the western edge of a small sandy rise fringing a recent1y­
constructed depression and drainage ditch modified for stocktank
water catchment. The nearest natural drainage is the inter­
mittent headwater flow of Dry Creek which occurs 150 meters
east of the site.
Cultural materials occurring on the si~e include burned
rock fragments and lithic debitage, mostly secondary and
tertiary chert flakes. Subsurface materials are shallow and
diffusely distributed through the sandy soils. Much of the
area is underlain by a thick accumulation of cobble-sized
gr.avels which are well exposed in the drainage ditch cut
through the site.
Most of the site has been thoroughly disrupted by the tank
and ditch construction. No additional work is warranted at
this site.

30

41 CD 82
Located 8.3 miles southeast of Ellinger and 5.3 miles north.
northwest of Columbus, this site is situated on the lower
eastern edge of the upland slopes bordering Dry Creek. The
surface of the site is irregular and broken, and gradually
slopes to the east toward Dry Creek.
Most of the site has been damaged by previous bulldozing
and burning during ranch road construction and the maintenance
of the immediately surrounding areas, The cultural materials
consist primarily of cores, core fragments, and lithic debitage
mixed with a high density of natural gravel cobbles.
The substantial burning and clearing of this area has
severely obscured the cultural record. No additional work is
warranted at this site.
41 CD 84
located about 3.5 miles southeast of Fayetteville, this
isolated artifact is situated on the sloping, northwestern
edge of a tributary to Bull Creek. The channel of the tr"fbutary
has been dammed and much of the immediate area has been modified
for stocktank construction. The find is a rough biface made
of thermally altered, red-gray chert with some cortex evident.
No additional cultural material was found in association with
this artifact.­

Located 1.7 miles east-northeast of Fayetteville and 0.85
mile southeast of Mt. Pilgrim Church, the site is situated on
a small knoll on the northern edge of a dense post oak wood­
land. The site consists of a remnant foundation of a commerical
rock crusher which was used during extensive gravel quarrying
on this tract. The rock crusher is a roughly rectangular
structure measuring about 10 x 4.5 feet. Evidence of the past
quarrying can be seen in the rolling terrain which has been
partially restored and developed as pasture.
The site lies just outside the western boundary of the
transmission line and is not endangered by construction­
related activities.
