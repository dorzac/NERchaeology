INTRODUCTION
Texas GSA Holdings, LP, proposes construction of a U.S. District Courthouse on a 2.75-acre
tract southwest of the intersection of Interwood South and Heathrow Forest parkways in Houston,
Texas, not far from Bush Intercontinental Airport (Figures 1 and 2). Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI),
was contracted by Mr. Ron Moore to evaluate the project area for potential impacts to cultural
resources properties eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP; GMI
project # 30576.00.01). Fieldwork was conducted on June 21, 2007, by Steven Hunt of GMI.
Melissa M. Green, also of GMI, served as Principal Investigator for the project.
The project area is bounded on the east side by Heathrow Forest Parkway (Figure 3) and on the
north side by Interwood South Parkway (Figure 4). The south and west boundaries are not
marked and had to be estimated in the field. A cleared, mown strip about 5 meters (m) wide was
found along both roads. Sewer manholes and a fire hydrant were found in this area, indicating
that buried utilities are present here (Figure 5). The remaining project area is wooded with a thick
understory of brambles, briars, vines, and saplings; many tree stumps were observed within the
project area (Figure 6). The ground surface appeared to undulate, with several small rises
approximately 1 m tall being observed. A linear open area, oriented roughly east-west, appeared
to coincide with the estimated south boundary (Figure 7). Soils in this area were extremely
saturated, and small areas of standing water were present (Figure 8).
The project area is approximately 1.4 kilometers north of Greens Bayou. An unnamed,
intermittent drainage is about 700 m east of the project area. As mapped, this channel is
unnaturally straight and likely represents a man-made drainage channel.
The project area is underlain by the Pleistocene-age Lissie Formation. This formation is fluvatile
in origin. The surface expression is fairly flat and featureless, with many rounded, shallow
depressions and pimple mounds. The upper part is composed of clay, silt, and sand with minor
amounts of small gravels. Mineral concretions, such as calcium carbonate, iron oxide, and ironmanganese oxides, are common in the zone of weathering. The lower part is also cpmposed of
clay, sand, and silt with minor amounts of gravels, although the gravels are coarser (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1992).
There are two soil units mapped for the project area: Aris fine sandy loam and Gessner loam.
Aris fine sandy loam is a nearly level soil that forms on the coastal prairie. Low, sandy, circular
mounds may be present in a few undisturbed areas. The typical soil profile begins with a dark
grayish brown fine sandy loam approximately 18 centimeters (cm; 7 inches [in]) thick, beneath
which is a grayish brown fine sandy loam from 18 to 53 cm (7–21 in). The underlying B horizon
begins with a gray sandy clay loam from 53 to 71 cm (21–28 in) below surface, followed by a
dark gray clay with red and strong brown mottling from 71 to 114 cm (28–46 in) below surface.
Finally, a gray clay is found from 114 to 152 cm (46–60 in) below surface (Wheeler 1976:10, 47).
Gessner loam is a nearly level soil that forms in broad irregular areas that are lower than the
surrounding landscape, as well as in small round depressions. The soil may be wet or ponded for
long periods after rains, but most of the water eventually evaporates. The mapped areas of
Gessner loam near the project area are small (roughly 10 acres) and numerous, suggesting that
they formed in small round depressions. The representative profile begins with a dark grayish
brown loam about 18 cm (7 in) thick, that is underlain by a grayish brown loam from 18 to 41 cm
(7–16 in) below surface. The B horizon begins with a dark gray loam with increased clay content

to 134 cm (34–53 in) below surface. Finally, a light gray sandy clay loam with yellowish brown
and brownish yellow mottling is found from 134 to 213 cm (53–84 in) below surface (Wheeler
1976:14–15, 51).

METHODS
The Texas State Site Atlas was consulted before beginning fieldwork. No sites are shown within
a 1-mile radius of the project area. In addition, no National Register-listed properties or State
Archeological Landmarks are shown within the -mile radius.
Limited archival research was done for the project area. Two historic maps (the General
Highway Map of Harris County (Texas State Highway Department 1939, 1961) and three aerial
photographs were found that illustrate the project area through much of the twentieth century. On
the 1939 map, the nearest structure to the project area is approximately 230 m southeast, on the
north side of present-day Aldine Bender Road. The 1961 map shows a north-south line of
structures east of the project area; this appears to be in the same location as the single structure on
the 1939 map. The aerial photographs in the Soil Survey of Harris County, Texas (Wheeler 1976)
show the project area as totally undeveloped; neither Interwood nor Heathrow Forest parkways
were yet built. A 1995 USGS aerial photograph shows both parkways, with the only buildings
near the project area being a commercial structure southeast of the intersection of Interwood
North and Heathrow Forest parkways and a post office south of Aldine Bender Road (Terraserver
1995). Finally, a 2002 USGS aerial photograph shows continued development of the area. In
addition to the properties present in 1995, additional development has occurred south of Aldine
Bender Road; large commercial properties have been built north and east of the intersection of
Interwood South and Heathrow Forest parkways, as well as northwest and southwest of the
intersection of Interwood North and Heathrow Forest parkways (Terraserver 2002).
Fieldwork consisted of both archeological and architectural evaluations. The archeological
evaluation began by systematically traversing the project area at approximately 30-m intervals.
Limited shovel testing was also undertaken during the investigation, primarily to document the
types of soil and contextual integrity within the project area, as well as to search for cultural
material. Each shovel test was approximately 35 cm in diameter and was dug to subsoil. The
soils removed from the shovel test were processed through .635-cm (.25-in) hardware cloth. The
results of each shovel test were recorded on standardized forms. Digital photographs were taken
to document the survey conditions, as well as to record any disturbances noted within the project
area. All photographs were recorded on standardized forms.
The architectural evaluation involved not only the project area, but a half-block area of potential
effects (APE) surrounding the project area. Any buildings within the project area or APE were
digitally photographed for later examination by an architectural historian.

RESULTS
The project area and APE are still undeveloped, so an architectural evaluation proved
unnecessary. A total of 10 shovel tests was excavated with the project area (Table 1; see Figure
2), but no cultural materials were discovered. The soil profiles uncovered in most of the shovel

tests are relatively consistent, but Shovel Test 8 exhibits a very different profile. This unit is near
Interwood South Parkway and may have been disturbed by road or utility construction. This unit
was the only evidence of disturbance noted in the wooded part of the project area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
As noted previously, no buildings exist within the project area or surrounding APE, so an
architectural evaluation was unnecessary. With regard to the archeological evaluation, the project
area is considered to have a low probability for containing a prehistoric occupation: it is a
considerable distance from Greens Bayou and there are no topographic features that might have
attracted a prehistoric population. The limited archival research done for this project indicates
that the project area was not developed until recently. A total of 10 shovel tests was excavated
within the project area, but no cultural materials were discovered. Given these factors, it appears
8

unlikely that the proposed construction will impact significant cultural deposits. If, however,
cultural materials should be discovered during construction, construction should be halted and the
Texas Historical Commission notified.
