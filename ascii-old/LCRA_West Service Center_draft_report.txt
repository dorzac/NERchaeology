MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
On February 2, 2017 the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of 2.9 acres at LCRA’s West Service Center. Travis County is proposing to lease the
property from LCRA as a road and bridge material storage site. The proposed lease tract is located to the
east of the Mansfield Dam and along the southern edge of the existing West Service Center (Figure 1).
A review of LCRA’s internal files and the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) online Texas
Archeological Site Atlas (Atlas) shows that the project area was previously surveyed in 1980 for LCRA;
however, due to increased survey standards from the 1980s and aging pf the site, a new investigation was
deemed necessary.
The project area was examined by LCRA Cultural Resources staff using standard survey and subsurface
testing methods. The Texas Historical Commission’s minimum state survey standards for the acreage
were not met due to the paucity of soils and high surface visibility. One new historic site, 41TV2530, was
recorded during the survey but does not appear to be eligible for designation as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL).
The cultural resource investigations were conducted under the terms of LCRA’s annual blanket State
Antiquities Permit 7899 in accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas and the Memorandum of
Understanding between the Texas Historical Commission and LCRA. There is no known or anticipated
federal funding or permitting involved with this project. No artifacts were collected during the survey; all
field records will be curated at an accredited curatorial facility.

ENVIROMENTAL BACKGROUND
The survey area is located in central Travis County just east of the Mansfield Dam and is between the
Colorado River and Bear Creek. The area consists mostly of gently sloping terraces with areas of sudden
topographic relief located along Bear Creek and parallel to the river due to dam construction. It is within a
section of the eastern Edwards Plateau that takes up most of central Texas. The Edwards Plateau is
distinguished as being an elevated region formed by marine deposits of shales, limestones, sandstones,
and dolomites 100 million years ago when the region was covered by ocean during the Cretaceous Period.
The eastern portion, where the project is located, is deeply eroded (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
[TPWD] 2017).
Soils within the project area are mapped as being Tarrant soils (TaD) with the immediate surrounding
area consisting of Brackett-Rock outcrop complex (BlD) and Brackett-Rock outcrop-Real complex (BoF).
Table 1 lists the basic characteristics of these soils. Much of the survey area consisted of exposed bedrock
or very gravelly soils.
The West Service Center is located within the Colorado River Basin. Vegetation in the area is dominated
by many poor quality browse, forb, and grass plants as well as Ashe juniper and red berry juniper. In the
absence of any agricultural and brush management much, the area has become overgrown with

dense stands of juniper, white brush or beebrush, and poison ivy. Live oak, mesquite, pecan, black
walnut, Chinese tallow, and Chinaberry trees are also present in small numbers (TPWD 2017).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The first archaeological investigations in the area around Mansfield Dam were conducted in the 1930s in
association with the construction of the dam itself, then known as Marshall Ford Dam. Once the dam was
completed in 1941, there were few investigations until the 1980s, when suburban neighborhoods, and
their attendant infrastructure, began to be developed. There are ten previously recorded sites within 1 mile
(1.6 kilometers [km]) of the project area (Table 2).
In 1980, LCRA hired Steven Kotter of Prewitt & Associates, Inc to conduct a survey of the area in
advance of planned brush clearing (Kotter 1980). This resulted in the recording of two prehistoric sites,
41TV525 and 41TV526, and one multi-component site, 41TV527.
Site 41TV525 is a lithic procurement site located on a slope approximately 150m southeast from the
Colorado River and consists of cortex flakes and beaten cobbles. Kotter described it as “surficial and
thinly distributed” (Kotter 1980), requiring no further investigation.
Site 41TV526 is a small site positioned upslope from and north of Bear Creek, a tributary on the left bank
of the Colorado. At 41TV526, Kotter notes scattered burned rocks, several interior flakes, and mussel
shell, which was surficial and disturbed by a road built nearby (Kotter 1980).
Site 41TV527 is a multi-component site 400 m east of the Colorado River and also upslope from and
north of Bear Creek. The historic component artifacts that were recovered consisted of possible

foundation stones for a structure and scattered metal, glass, and ceramic fragments, all of which are
consistent with a farmstead dating to the early to mid-20th century. This was confirmed in 2015 through
archival research that revealed the area was occupied in the 1850s by by either John Choate or Elzey
Stockton. (Arnn et al. 2016) The prehistoric artifacts consisted of a light lithic scatter, possible burned
rock, and a distal tip biface fragment. The report described the site as “apparently surficial and thinly
distributed; does not contain a high information yield potential” (Kotter 1980); however, results of the
2015 survey indicate at least one, and possibly two, buried prehistoric component(s). (Arnn et al. 2015)
The area was also cleared of vegetation as part of a fire brake lane in 2013 (Hixson et al. 2014).
Site 41TV2182 is located north of the project area and was recorded in 2006 during a survey for Travis
County Water Development Board for District 17 (Atlas 2017). The site represents both an Archaic
period component and an historic camp for WPA workers associated with the construction of Mansfield
Dam in the 1930s.
Site 41TV2382 is located directly southwest of the project area and was recorded in 2010 by LCRA staff
during a survey of the Austin Energy Easement (Atlas 2017). The site represents a prehistoric lithic
scatter and small hearth.
In 2013, Lake Travis water levels remained low within the dam, allowing LCRA staff to record the
historic site 41TV2443, which is related to dam construction and includes concrete slabs, as well as
cigarette and newspaper vending machines (Arnn et al. 2016).
Most recently, in 2015, LCRA staff conducted a survey for the Mansfield Dam Low Water Crossing Park
improvement project which covered 41 acres immediately south of the Mansfield Dam along the left bank
of the Colorado River. During this survey sites 41TV525 and 41TV527, were revisited and reassessed and
four previously unrecorded sites, 41TV2481–41TV2484, were documented.
Site 41TV2481 was identified as the Hughes Homestead and is a historic homestead with a minor
prehistoric component. The prehistoric component consists of a small amount of lithic debitage. Although
1930s imagery shows the presence of a barn-like structure, an outbuilding and a primary house, the
buildings were demolished in the 1980s (Arnn et al. 2016). The survey in 2015 revealed that only two
concrete slabs remain.
Site 41TV2482 is located on a landform overlooking Bear Creek and is 730 m east of the Colorado River.
The site is a heavily looted burned rock midden composed of fire cracked limestone and chert with
mussel shell and chert artifacts (Arnn el at. 2016).
Site 41TV2483 consists of two explosives storage buildings located along an old service road that was
once access to the subdivision to the south. According to a 1973 document on file at LCRA, the road was
discontinued around 1969, and what is now Blue Jay Lane provides access to the two structures. The
smaller structure is referenced as a “dynamite cap cache” and the larger as a “dynamite cache.” There is
no indication that the structures were in use at this time, nor can it demonstrated that they were actually in
place during dam construction (Arnn el at. 2016). Few artifacts were observed except for a few cans, an
iron pipe, a metal panel, and some sheet steel.

Site 41TV2484 is a twentieth century historic site consisting of ruins of a former fishing bait shop and
store that is located on a low terrace on the east side of Lake Austin. The physical remains present consist
of foundation walls and a rubble pile of building materials. Few artifacts were apparent in the 2015 survey
(Arnn el at. 2016).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Prehistoric Background
The project area is considered to be in the central eastern margin of the central Texas archaeological
region (Prewitt 1981:72). Central Texas prehistory has traditionally been divided into four main eras or
periods, which are subdivided further into phases or subperiods. An enduring chronology by Prewitt
(1981, 1985) has been revised by Johnson and Goode (1994), who utilized new lines of evidence based on
climatic and geomorphological data to redefine period divisions. This can be contrasted with Collins
(1995), who indicates climatic variables at times were somewhat different than those of Johnson and
Goode. A more detailed prehistoric cultural context will be included in the final version of this report.
Historic Background
Starting in the 1850s, settlers began farming the land around the Colorado River. These communities
came together around schools and mills operated by Noah Smithwick, Thomas Anderson, and others,
giving rise to small communities such as Volente, Smithwick, and Spicewood. Several crossings
connected communities and families to the other side of the river and farmers relied on the
hydroelectricity produced by the mills and the river to process their crops until fuel and steam power
became common.

However, with several large floods, many of these crossings were swallowed by the raging floodwaters
resulting in the fracturing of the communities and farmland was inundated, making farming impractical.
Small communities around the river began to breakdown and consolidate and, as a result, populations
began to centralize into cities such as Marble Falls and Austin. Small towns such as Smithwick and
Spicewood also survived due to this.
In December 1936 the United States Department of the Interior approved the Lower Colorado River
Authority to build a low dam at the site of an old crossing on the Colorado River known as Marshall Ford.
Marshall Ford Dam was completed in July 1939. The dam was used for many years to connect the
ranching and agricultural areas of the western part of Texas with Austin. It quickly became a trading
center and supply point and the bend in the river became a market center for cedar timber and posts
(Hazlewood 2010).
The present Mansfield Dam is a 7,098-foot-long concrete, earth, and rockfill structure that replaced the
original dam (Breeding 2010). It was built and “specifically designed to contain floodwaters” in the flash
flood prone region. LCRA and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation built the dam from 1937 to 1942 and after
a severe flood in July of 1938, LCRA raised the height of the dam to add more storage capacity for the
floodwaters (Figure 2). Though the Corps of Engineers still refers to it as Marshall Ford Dam, it was
renamed in 1941 for U.S. Rep. J.J. Mansfield, who assisted in the project's development (LCRA 2017).
The project was completed by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) workers as part of the Public
Works Administration, a prominent New Deal agency. The building of the dam allowed for enough
stability in the area for the construction of several urban and suburban communities that still exist today.

METHODOLOGY
The survey was designed to identify unrecorded archaeological sites and assess them for eligibility for
formal listing as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL). An intensive cultural resource survey was carried
out within the 3 acres designed within the proposed lease tract. All work was conducted under blanket
TAC Permit 7899 and terms of the memorandum of understanding between THC and LCRA, which
incorporates Council of Texas Archeologists survey and reporting standards.
The assessment consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey with supplemental shovel testing. One shovel
test was excavated in an area with poor surface visibility and the potential for soils. In general, ground
visibility was observed to be good at about 80 percent. The number of shovel tests does not meet
minimum survey standards for the state of Texas due to high ground surface visibility and the majority of
the surface consisting of exposed bedrock or very gravelly soils. Artifacts were recorded, but were not
collected.

RESULTS
Survey work was conducted on February 2, 2017, by Valerie Werfel and Mike Smith. Much of the project
area consisted of extremely dense and gravelly soils or exposed bedrock with very high ground visibility.
As a result, work consisted of surface observation and one shovel test being excavated. The test was
negative for cultural materials and extended 5 centimeters below surface (cmbs) due to very dense, stony
clay soils (Appendix I). However, during the course of pedestrian survey, site 41TV2530, a large historic
trash scatter, was discovered.
41TV2530
Site Overview
Along the southern edge of the project boundary, and possible extending further, lies site 41TV2530.
Ground surface at the time was composed of exposed bedrock or very gravelly soil resulting in high
ground visibility, averaging 80 percent. Patches of short grasses were present, however the area is
overgrown with dense Ashe juniper trees.
Work Performed
Surface observation revealed a surface scatter of approximately 50 glass jars and metal cans (Figure 3),
the extent of which is shown in the cluster of waypoints on the left side of the site boundary (Figure 4).
The waypoints on the right side of the site boundary represent a very dense pile of historic domestic
materials of various types. The scatter is believed to extend beyond the limits of the project boundary.
Based on the extent of the surface scatter, the dimensions of the site within the present project area
measure approximately 63 meters (m) east-west and 27 m north-south.

Artifact Analysis
Artifacts observed within the more diffuse trash scatter to the west consist mainly of glass KARO jars
(Figure 5) and metal cans with numerous other glass and metal fragments. Materials observed in the
denser trash pile on the site’s eastern margin include ceramic houseware (e.g., plates, bowls) (Figure 6),
lightbulbs, corroded battery cores, and glass vessels. Among the glass artifacts were jars, container glass
such as champagne and beer bottle fragments, CLOROX and RAINBOW bottles (Glass Bottle Marks
2017), fragments of Depression Era glass, and various other colorless, green, blue, amethyst, milk, amber,
and aqua glass fragments. All artifacts observed and analyzed date roughly between 1936 and 1949.
These artifacts likely originated from the WPA government workers associated with the construction of
the Mansfield Dam and may have originated from the nearby site, 41TV2182.

Conclusions and Recommendation
Though site 41TV2530 represents a historic trash site with many diagnostic materials, much is already
known about WPA government workers in the 1930s and the area surrounding the Mansfield Dam. For
this reason, its size and location have been recorded but no further study is deemed necessary. It is the
LCRA’s opinion that the portion of the site within the project boundaries does not meet the requirements
of eligibility for designation as an SAL.

SUMMARY
LCRA Cultural Resources Staff conducted an intensive archaeological assessment of a 2.9-acre plot that
is to be affected by the West Service Center expansion. One archaeological site, 41TV2530, was

recorded. Although the site may extend to the south beyond its defined boundaries, the portion of the site
within the project limits does not appear to be SAL eligible nor to require additional analysis.
Standard emergency discovery procedures will be in place, and should any previously undiscovered
cultural resources be discovered in the course of the addition, work in the immediate vicinity of the
discovery will cease, and LCRA Cultural Resources staff will be contacted to determine what, if any,
mitigation efforts are necessary.
