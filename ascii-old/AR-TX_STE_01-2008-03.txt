ABSTRACT
Sphere 3 Environmental, Inc. (Sphere 3), on May 28 through May 30 and June 2, 2008,
conducted a 100-percent intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey of an approximately 92acre tract of land proposed for new school facilities and campus in Hallsville, Harrison County,
Texas. Hallsville Independent School District (HISD) contracted with Sphere 3 to conduct a 100percent pedestrian cultural resources survey of approximately 92 acres of undeveloped land to
determine if any properties eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or listing as a State Archaeological Landmark (SALS) will be affected by proposed
construction. Marc A. Tiemann served as Project Archaeologist and Principal Investigator,
supervising all fieldwork.
This survey identified no archaeological sites determined eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or to be listed as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
Sphere 3 is requesting concurrence with our eligibility determination and our recommendation for
HISD to proceed with their proposed construction and development activities.

INTRODUCTION
Hallsville Independent School District (HISD) is currently preparing to develop new school
facilities on a 92-acre tract of land in Harrison County, Texas. The project area consists of
primarily undeveloped land at the intersection of Cider Road and Cal Young Road in Hallsville,
Texas. A significant portion of the property is open; recently harvested for timber or currently
utilized as pasture. The northern portion of the property is forested. There is an existing
residential structure and a barn on the property. The topographic map indicates three intermittent
tributaries on the property draining towards Wards Creek. Approximately 40 percent of the
property was forested at the time of the survey, much of which is mature growth (40+ years). The
92-acre tract is immediately adjacent and north of a suburban residential neighborhood.
The antiquities permit (4937) for the cultural resources survey is required because HISD is
considered a political sub-unit of the State of Texas and therefore falls within the jurisprudence of
the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The project is therefore designed to comply with the
procedural rules of the Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and of the Texas
Antiquities Code. These investigations also are designed to comply with the Clean Water Act,
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (Public Law [PL] 89-665), as amended in 1974
(PL 97-442), 1976 and 1980; and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL 81-190, 83
Stat. 915, 42 USC 4321, 1970).
The services of Sphere 3 Environmental, Inc. (Sphere 3) were retained by HISD to conduct a
100% intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed project location to determine if any
properties that are eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or
listing as a State Archaeological Landmark (SALS) will be affected by proposed construction
activities. A map of the proposed project area and shovel test locations is included in Appendix C
(Figures 1 and 2).
Topographically, the 92-acre tract covers a high ridge crest which gently slopes towards the north
to three unnamed tributaries feeding a man-made pond. According to a local informant (the
present landowner of the property), these tributaries were not pronounced nor deeply entrenched
until after the construction of the pond. He also commented that he grew up on the property
avidly searching for artifacts; yet never discovered them in his youth, nor encountered any
aboriginal materials whilst cultivating his fields in his adulthood.
According to the Soil Survey of Harrison County (Golden et al. 1994), soil units within the
project area are mapped as Kirvin (KfC) very fine sandy loam occurring on slopes ranging from 2
to 5 percent for the crest of the ridge, Iuka (Iu) fine sandy loam, frequently flooded for the areas
surrounding the tributaries, and Bowie (BoC) very fine sandy loam for the remaining portions of
the property (Appendix C, Figure 3).
The project area lies within the Austroriparian biotic province, one of seven recognized by Blair
(1950) and Dice (1943) for the state of Texas based on ecological associations of a relatively
stable assemblage of plants and animals. This ecotone describes a region comprised of hardwoods
and pines extending eastward to the Atlantic, the dominant species being loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda). The vegetative species identified during field observations primarily represent a relatively
stable secondary growth cycle in areas not recently disturbed by agricultural activities or tree
harvesting. Species observed in the field include sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), sugarberry
(Celtis laevigata), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), white oak (Quercus alba), winged elm (Ulmus

3

alata), and greenbriar (Smilax sp.). Thornthwaite (1948) classifies the province as B1 (humid)
climate, with a moisture surplus index of 20 to 40 per cent.” According to the Soil Survey of
Harrison County (Golden et al. 1994), the total annual precipitation is about 46.9 inches. Average
temperatures range from 46 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter to 81 degrees Fahrenheit in the
summer.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Prior to initiating fieldwork, a site file search on the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas database at
http://pedernales.thc.state.tx.us/index.html was conducted to find out if any sites had been
recorded within the immediate project area. Based on the search, one archaeological site
(41HS908) was found to be recorded within one mile of the project area. This site was recorded
as an historic cemetery associated with Fort Crawford, an early Republic era civilian protective
encampment of the early to late 19th century. Thomas E. Speir, the recorder of the site, noted
coffin nails, stone markers, and iron fencing at the site. This site will not be impacted by HISD’s
proposed construction activities. Moreover, no archaeological sites are recorded within a halfmile radius of the project tract.

Paleo-Indian Period (before 10,000 to 6500 B.C.)
This cultural period designates populations known to inhabit the Americas from the terminal
Pleistocene to the early Holocene. It is represented by peoples known to share a pan-hemispheric
cultural system. Peoples inhabiting East Texas at this time exhibit remarkable similarities in
cultural traits with other groups of this period that appear throughout North and South America.
American anthropologists and prehistorians are in nearly unanimous agreement that the earliest
human populations to enter North America entered by crossing Beringia, the now submerged land
bridge separating Siberia from North America. During this time Sea levels had dropped to about
250 to 350 feet below present levels (Meltzer 1989), creating a broad isthmus by which herds of
animals were followed into the interior of North America. As they progressed southward, human
populations inhabited new lands adapting to new environments.
Controversy regarding the use of the term “Paleoindian” to describe all cultural developments for
the first humans in the New World has been discussed early on in the literature as some scholars
find its use descriptively inadequate (Willey and Phillips 1958:80). In further complicating this
matter, Belew (2003) points out that recent discoveries at Monte Verde, Chile, South America
(Petit 1998) and the Topper Site, North Carolina (Goodyear 2000) indicate settlements of peoples
earlier than 10,000 with lithic assemblages devoid of projectile points. These “pre-projectile
point” cultures do not appear in the archaeological record for Texas and it is generally accepted
that the “first Americans” to appear in Texas coincide with Clovis spear point users at 10,000
B.C.
This period of the terminal Pleistocene was significantly cooler and drier than the present climate.
Populations are characterized as consisting of highly mobile bands of large-game hunters.
Projectile points during this period are lanceolates ranging from skillfully fluted (Clovis and
Folsom) to unfluted varieties (Scottsbluff, Plainview, Meserve, and Angostura). These points,
representing long, stout spears and the atlatl that thrusted them, suggests the existence of a
subsistence strategy based primarily on hunting large mammals (Wilmsen 1970).

4

Archaic Period (6,000 to 200 B.C.)
The Archaic refers to hunter-gatherer cultures, which implemented regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting the environment (Muller 1986). During this period, the
archaeological record is characterized by the introduction of gouges, manos, and metates that
indicate an increased reliance on vegetal resources. Tool kits also undergo increasing
diversification and specialization. The number of sites increases during the middle and later
Archaic phases. Predominant location of sites changes from major streams to minor streams and
natural springs (Perttula and Skiles 1986:48-53). The utilization of environmentally specific
resources made necessary the development of resource-specific tools, such as stone pipes,
mortars, pestles, and mealing stones. The Archaic artifact assemblage contains bone, shell and
copper substances (Neuman 1984). This hunting and gathering subsistence strategy, with
settlement patterns approaching semi-sedentary residency lasted until the development of pottery
and bow and arrow.
The earliest appearances of ceramics and the bow-and-arrow in Texas occurred in the extreme
northeast and in the far west between 500 B.C. and A.D. 1. For northeast Texas, the “Woodland
Stage” is employed to explain Texas’ earliest known ceramic-bearing area, as activities related to
the Tchefuncte culture of Louisiana (ca. 500 BC – AD 1) produced documented manifestations as
far west as the Red River basin of northeast Texas (Gregory and Curry 1978:43; Neuman 1984).
By later Woodland years, arrow points utilized in the long bow have become dominant in this area
over the larger dart points utilized throughout the Archaic in the atlatl (Perttula and Skiles 1986:
53-54; Story 1990: 249). The Woodland concludes with the widespread use of bow and arrow and
a broad variety of ceramics (Story et al. 1990).

Early Ceramic (Woodland) Period (c. 500 BC – AD 1200)
The Early Ceramic period is primarily characterized by an increased utilization of the environment.
By the end of the earliest Woodland phase, the people of the East Texas have increased their
reliance on cultigens (corn and squash) and are remaining longer at specific locales. Gradual shifts
toward more permanent settlements had been occurring since about 2000 BC. Long distance
exchange networks were probably in full operation, as copper, marine shell, and other raw materials
were imported from thousands of kilometers distant (Sabo and Early 1988:73). During the early
Woodland phase, populations residing throughout East Texas were within the sphere of influence
of complex cultural groups in Louisiana. The Poverty Point was still a powerful cultural force to
the east, no doubt interacting and influencing groups in East Texas. These changes evolved out of
ancestral Archaic traditions.
By middle Woodland times, pottery—specifically, sand tempered ware—had become common
throughout East Texas and northwest Louisiana. Horticulture became more indispensable to
overall food procurement with widespread production and storage of domesticated maize, squash,
and gourds (Newman 1984). By later Woodland years, arrow points utilized in the long bow have
become dominant over the larger dart points utilized throughout the Archaic in the atlatl (Perttula
and Skiles 1986: 53-54; Story 1990: 249). The Woodland concludes with the widespread use of
bow and arrow and a broad variety of ceramics (Story et al. 1990).

Late Prehistoric Period (c. A.D. 800 -1680)
As distinctive cultural sequences are developing in Louisiana (i.e. Tchefuncte, Marksville,
Troyville-Coles Creek, Poverty Point, Plaquemine, and Mississippian), the indigenous development

5

of the Caddoan culture emerges which is strongly influenced by the Mississippian tradition of the
Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323).
The Caddoan culture proliferates in East Texas. The Caddoan culture exhibited continuity along
the traits of house site construction and subsistence practices. Houses were circular, as
demonstrated by excavated post mold patterns from the Hanna Site (16RR4) and the Werner
Mound site (16BO8) (Thomas et al. 1980:111, Webb 1983:219-221). Floral and faunal remains
recovered from Caddoan sites are maize, squash, gourd, hickory nut, acorns, deer and a variety of
other mammalian and aquatic fauna. This represents a particularly wide variety of subsistence
foods being exploited (Jeter and Williams, Jr. 1989:202). Caddo subsistence and social
organization differ markedly from the previous periods. Horticulture and then agriculture
supplemented hunting and gathering. Larger aggregates of people became sedentary and
constructed villages with public ceremonial areas in the early years but an absence of ceremonial
mounds in later years of the Caddo cultural sequence (Miller et al 2000). Cemeteries are found in
association with large ceremonial mounds. Extensive commercial networks also were established.
Service (1962, 1975) was first to define a stratified social structure corresponding to the chiefdom
level.

Historic Period
The historic period describes briefly the transition in the area from domination by native peoples
to European settlement and the subsequent establishment of farms, towns, and counties. The land
was initially inhabited by the confederacies of the Hasinais and other Caddoan groups during this
period. These groups of allied confederations were known as the Timber Tribes (Lagrone 1979).
They resided in farming villages, raising grain and vegetables and hunting for small game in the
forests. They also constructed burial mounds.
During the European colonization of the New World, Spain and France both claimed the area.
The former established a line of protected missions located approximately 100 miles south of
Harrison County. The explorations of René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle formed the basis to
France’s claim. European weapons and disease decimated the indigenous populations making
American settlement in the area relatively peaceful (Campbell 1983). The Caddoes, the
indigenous culture of northeastern Texas since before 1000 A.D., offered little resistance to
Anglo-American settlers, which arrived in large numbers beginning in the 1830s. By 1835, a
dozen Americans had received land grants from Mexican authorities. Following establishment of
the Texas Republic, this area gained sufficient population for the new nation’s Congress to
officially establish Harrison County – drawn from Shelby County – in 1839 (Campbell 2006).
Founded on January 30, 1841, (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004), Marshall – named by Isaac Van Zandt
in honor of United States Chief Justice John Marshall, was laid out with the intention of
becoming the seat of Harrison County, and ultimately a significant city of East Texas. Peter
Whetstone offered tracts for a church, school, and future courthouse. Because of Whetstone’s
offer of a courthouse, County officials made Marshall the county seat in 1842. The City of
Marshall was incorporated in 1844 and enlarged “…to include an area of one square mile with the
courthouse at the center.” In 1854, Marshall became Texas’ first town to have telegraph service,
located at the local newspaper’s office. By 1860, Marshall, with approximately 2,000 inhabitants
(Campbell 2007), was the fifth largest city in Texas and East Texas’ first metropolis (Anonymous
2007).
The economy was primarily based on the southern cotton plantation way of life. In 1850,
Harrison County had more slaves than any other in Texas. Cotton was so successful that by 1860,

6

the census records for the county record a slave population of 8,784 (59 percent of the total
population and still with the greatest number of all counties in Texas), 145 plantation owners
owning at least 20 bondsmen, and a cotton crop of 21,440 bales (Campbell 2006); making
Harrison County the wealthiest and most productive in Antebellum Texas (Campbell 1983).
Marshall
Harrison County, as a whole, strongly favored succession from the Union, as encouraged by the
pro-secession newspaper, the Marshall Texas Republican (Campbell 2007). Once the war begun,
Harrison County sent many troops and contributing materials to the war effort (Campbell 1983).
The first and last governors of Texas as a Confederate state, Edward Clark and Pendleton Murrah,
were from Marshall. The Confederate government of the State of Missouri was relocated to
Marshall (Campbell 2007). Under Missouri governance, Marshall produced gunpowder and other
needs for the Confederate Army (Anonymous 2007). Following Northern occupation of
Vicksburg, Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith set up the Trans-Mississippi Department
in Marshall. Federal troops encroaching on the key Confederate stronghold were defeated at the
Battle of Mansfield, Louisiana in April 1864 (Campbell 2007).
The army of the Trans-Mississippi Department disintegrated, permitting Northern occupation of
Marshall on June 17, 1865 (Campbell 2007). The Confederate powder mill fell into looters’ hands
(Anonymous 2007). Slavery was ended, and Reconstruction was instituted (Campbell 1983).
Tensions between whites and blacks were exacerbated in the county as the federal government
bolstered the positioning of the black majority in politics and society. In 1878, the Citizens Party
(Campbell 2006), led by former Confederate General Walter P. Lane (Anonymous 2007),
“redeemed” city and county government from the Republicans dominated by African Americans,
who soon were largely disenfranchised (Campbell 2006).
After the Civil War, Harrison County remained rural and agricultural. The economy, based on
primarily on cotton, continued to be lucrative for the county well into the early 20th Century
(Campbell 1983). Population grew from 25,171 to 48,397 during these decades, with the number
of farms increasing from 2,748 to 6,802. African Americans remained in the majority, with over
60 percent of the population from 1880 to 1930 (Campbell 2006).
The county’s economy began to diversify, as the state’s burgeoning railroad industry found
Harrison County as a useful crossroads. The Texas Western Railroad was chartered in 1852 to
connect Caddo Lake and Marshall. In 1856 its name was changed to “Southern Pacific Railroad
Company” (“local” SP), which was not related to the more famous “Southern Pacific” (SP)
extending from Louisiana to California. In 1858, the “local” SP completed that long-proposed
line connecting Marshall with Swanson’s Landing. To retain its charter, the “local” SP
inaugurated service using oxen to pull the train until the steam locomotive finally was delivered.
Sometime later, the “local” SP constructed a line connecting Marshall and Shreveport (Marshall
Depot Inc. 2004).
The next rail company to be established was the Texas Pacific Railroad Company, chartered in
1871 to connect Marshall and San Diego, California (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004). This became the
major east-west link through Harrison County, connecting Shreveport with Dallas and Fort Worth
(Campbell 2006). County and city officials donated to the new railroad lands and bonds worth
$300,000. In return, the new company located its general offices and shops were situated in
Marshall. In 1872, the United States Congress changed the name to Texas & Pacific Railway
Company (T&P), the state’s only federally chartered rail company (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004).
Also in 1872, the T&P absorbed the old “local” SP, extending the line into Louisiana, ultimately
reaching New Orleans in 1882 (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004). The T&P extended its north line to

7

Texarkana (Campbell 2006), making for a through-line between Texarkana and Dallas by 1873,
which was extended to Fort Worth and Sherman by 1876. The T&P greatly benefited from its
access to Texarkana, which also was served by lines extending to St. Louis (Marshall Depot Inc.
2004).
By 1879, Marshall was experiencing remarkable economic prosperity. Marshall became the
regional cotton-marketing center for East Texas (Campbell 2007). According to a City of
Marshall promotional brochure, the presence of the offices, machine shops, and workshops of the
Texas & Pacific Railroad were the primary cause for these good times for the numerous workers
employed by the railroad and related industries (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004). J. Weisman and Co.,
the first department store in Texas, opened in Marshall in 1878. Marshall Pottery, a mainstay in
Harrison County economy for more than a century, was established by W. F. Rocker of Marshall
in 1895 at the location of abundant white clay deposits (Anonymous 2007).
This vigorous economy attracted several major educational institutions serving East Texas.
Marshall University emphasized secondary education. Marshall Masonic Female Institute, which
flourished during the Civil War, continued educating hundreds of women from the region. In
1873, the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded Wiley College, which became the
region’s first institution of higher learning for black students. Its certification by the Freedman’s
Aid Society in 1882 marked a major achievement for the institution (Anonymous 2007). Bishop
College was established in 1881 as the city’s second black college, which eventually moved to
Dallas in 1961. East Texas Baptist College was founded in 1914, changing its name to “East
Texas Baptist University” in 1984 (Campbell 2007).
By 1881, the T&P had completed its largest segment, a 522-mile stretch of track west of Fort
Worth to Sierra Blanca. From there, T&P trains were permitted, according to an agreement
forged by T&P’s president, Jay Gould, to use Southern Pacific tracks to El Paso and beyond,
thereby forming a continuous line from Marshall to the west coast (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004).
Before 1900, T&P headquarters were relocated to Fort Worth, leaving its 66 acres of shops in
Marshall. This expansive array of 57 structures consisted of: roundhouse, car shops, water tower,
and warehouse. In 1912, the T&P erected a three-story, 7,500-square-foot edifice to serve as the
Marshall depot and as administrative offices for the company’s eastern region. Under the longterm presidency of John L. Lancaster (1916-1945), the T&P enjoyed a “golden age” of
prosperity. With discovery of oil in eastern Texas, rail transportation dramatically increased.
During World War II, record traffic movements were recorded through Harrison County, all of
which enhanced Marshall’s prosperity. The Depot’s interior was modernized to handle increased
travelers in the 1930s, including a pedestrian tunnel under the tracks southward to the historic
Ginocchio Hotel (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004).
Sometime after World War II, the T&P shops were closed in Marshall. These service facilities
were geared to the maintenance of steam locomotives. As diesel engines emerged as the dominant
source of power for pulling trains, the Marshall shops became obsolete, causing them to close. In
1970, the T&P ended passenger service to Marshall. The famous depot remained out of service
until Amtrak commenced passenger service in 1974. In 1976, the T&P was merged with the
Missouri Pacific Railroad (MP), and this company was absorbed by the Union Pacific (UP) in
1982 (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004).
While all traces of the shops have vanished, the T&P Depot remains a distinctive landmark in
Marshall’s architectural landscape. In 1988, the Union Pacific (UP) brought attention to the need
to eliminate the unsafe conditions of the Depot. The non-profit organization, Marshall Depot, Inc.
undertook to restore the building, with the UP Foundation provided much of the funding. Today,

8

it serves as Amtrak’s depot, snack shop, gift shop, tourist information center, and railroad
museum. This major restoration initiative led to the adaptive re-use of the Ginnochio Hotel as the
Harrison County Historical Museum (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004).
The black majority began declining as a result of the effects of the Great Depression, which
forced numerous African Americans employed in agriculture to leave the county and seek work
larger cities (Campbell 1983). This trend continued and was reinforced by World War II as more
employment opportunities were made available in the industrial sector. The railroad transformed
Marshall into a major retail center, with its population by 1930 reaching 16,203 and
manufacturing establishments employing 2,319 workers. For the first time, in 1940 more county
workers derived income from nonagricultural occupations, including government-funded public
emergency works (Campbell 2006).
Being a traditionally black-majority area, Marshall was a center of civil rights activity. Marshall
resident Herman Sweatt, the first African American student at the University of Texas at Austin,
entered Law School in 1950 under orders of the Texas Supreme Court. Marshall native James L.
Farmer, Jr. organized the Freedom Rides and helped found the Congress of Racial Equality
during the 1960s. African American students in Marshall organized the first sit-ins to have
occurred in Texas, taking place in the rotunda of the Harrison County courthouse, to desegregate
Marshall public schools (Anonymous 2007).
For those who remained on the farm, quality of life significantly improved. The Panola-Harrison
Electric Cooperative commenced rural electrification in 1937. Beginning in 1928, the production
of oil and natural gas has steadily increased economic effect for property owners to the present.
By 1978, only one farmer continued to produce cotton, as agriculture by this time was dominated
by cattle raising and mixed cultivation (Campbell 2006).
In Marshall, small-scale manufacturing of metal, wood, and clay products provided almost half of
the employment for Harrison County. For both the city and throughout the rural areas of the
county, education rose dramatically, with 23 percent of adults over 24 being high school
graduates in 1950 but with this figure rising to 42 percent by 1970 and over 50 percent by 1980.
The three decades following World War II witnessed significant population declines for the
county, but by 1980, the county’s population dramatically rose to 52,265, with the City of
Marshall attaining for the first time 24,921. By 2000, the county recorded 62,110, with 23,935
residing in Marshall. Two other towns in 2000 exceeded 2000 population, Hallsville and
Wascom. By this time, tourism was increasing in economic importance, with main attractions
being Caddo Lake State Park, Lake O’ The Pines (Campbell 2006), and the museums housed in
the restored Marshall Depot and Ginnochio Hotel complex (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004).
This project area is located less than one-half mile to the northwest of the City of Hallsville,
located 12 miles west of Marshall. The earliest recorded settlement in this area was Fort
Crawford, built in 1839 one mile west of present-day Hallsville and less than two miles southwest
of the survey area. This installation, erected by W. C. Crawford to offer protection against Indian
attacks and raids, grew into a town with a post office and two-story public building serving as a
church and Masonic hall. This school remained western Harrison County’s only children’s
educational institution until Fort Crawford’s demise after the Civil War (Lentz 2008).
In 1869, the aforementioned independent Southern Pacific established to its east a temporary
terminus named “Hallville,” in which were established a post office, saloon, and railroad general
office and machine shops. The boomtown, incorporated in 1870, soon had accumulated some 50
commercial establishments to support the shipping of cotton, wool, and hides. With the extension

9

of the railroad to what became Longview in 1872, Hallville rapidly lost much of this business.
The next year, the new railroad company moved its shops to Marshall (as discussed above), and
most of its population moved into the county seat. The remaining 600 residents by 1884 were
using three churches, six sawmills, six cotton gin/grist mill complexes, two saloons, one hotel,
and a cooperative association. By 1909, a bank had opened, and separate public schools for white
and African American children were flourishing (Lentz 2008).
During the 1920s, the post office changed the official name to “Hallsville,” and the community
was re-incorporated in 1935 following years during which municipal government had become
inactive. The population fluctuated from 300 to 700 from the 1880s to the 1930s, before
exceeding 1,000 during the 1940s. By 2000, the town’s population was 2,772, with number of
businesses growing from 20 in 1966 to 31 in 1988 (Lentz 2008).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Prior to initiating fieldwork, a research design was devised to investigate the proposed 92-acre
tract of land for cultural resources potentially eligible for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places or listing as a State Historic Landmark. This design consists of a four-part
strategy: 1) background research and documents check, 2) permit application, (3) fieldwork
following the Texas Historical Commission’s archeological standards for Texas, (4) submission
of a draft report for review by the THC, and submission of 20 final copies of the report to the
THC for their library and research libraries across the state.
Step (1) entailed a search of the relevant literature and reports within the general area and a site
file search of the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas Database. The site file search indicated no
archaeological sites directly within the impact zone of the proposed HISD project area. Only one
archaeological site (41HS908) was found to be recorded within one mile of the project area. This
site was recorded as an historic cemetery associated with Fort Crawford, an early Republic era
civilian protective encampment of the early to late 19th century. Thomas E. Speir, the recorder of
the site, noted coffin nails, stone markers, and iron fencing at the site. This site will not be
impacted by HISD’s proposed construction activities. Moreover, no archaeological sites are
recorded within a half-mile radius of the project tract.
In fulfillment of Step (2), Texas Antiquities permit #4937 was issued (5-28-2008) to conduct a
100% intensive pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel testing of the project areas. The
shovel testing program was designed to explore these areas for subsurface cultural deposits. If
sites were located, then investigations were to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each
site, determine each site’s integrity, and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential
eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or listing as a State Historic Landmark.
Fieldwork (Step 3) was accomplished in three workdays by a four-person team. A total of 55
shovel tests measuring 30 cm x 30 cm was excavated within the 92-acre tract at either 100 meter
(328-foot) intervals or 30 meter (98-foot) intervals near stream crossings for the proposed HISD
campus. These tests were excavated in arbitrary 10 cm levels within natural strata down to the
sterile clay substrate. The excavated matrix was screened through ¼ inch wire hardware cloth.
Records of each shovel test were maintained with information on soil texture, color on the
Munsell chart, depth of the unit, and cultural materials recovered. If cultural materials were
recovered, the research design specified that additional shovel tests be placed every 10 meters in

10

cardinal directions on a grid from the positive test until two consecutive units contained no
cultural materials.
In fulfilling Step 4, a draft of the survey report was submitted for review by THC. Upon approval
of the draft by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) of Texas, 20 copies of the final
report will be delivered to the THC and two copies to the project sponsor (HISD). Sphere 3 will
maintain a copy of this report and certain field and research notes, photographs, and related
information.

ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
The 100% intensive survey and shovel testing program of the proposed HISD development area
resulted in the identification of no archaeological sites. All 55 shovel tests excavated on the
property contained no cultural materials. The existing home and barn on the property were built
in the 1970s. Therefore, no historic properties were identified as eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places or listing as a State Archaeological Landmark (SAL).

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the topography and proximity of aquatic resources, the potential for finding cultural
resources within the property was determined to be high. This survey identified no archaeological
sites; therefore, any future improvements to the property will not have an effect on resources
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or to be listed as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL). All 55 shovel tests excavated for the project contained no
cultural materials. In addition, there are no buildings, 50 years or older, that are located on or
adjacent to the project tract. Therefore, Sphere 3 recommends that all future proposed
improvements on the property proceed as no cultural resources will be impacted. No further
cultural resource work is recommended for the entire 92-acre tract proposed for HISD
development.
