Abstract

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company conducted a combination reconnaissance and
systematic cultural resources investigation for the Hidalgo Protective
Levee System Rehabilitation Project in Hidalgo County, Texas on behalf
of the United States Section, International Boundary and Water
Commission (USIBWC). The project consists of raising the 4.5-mile
Hidalgo Protective Levee System, from 3 â 9 feet depending on location, to
meet current requirements for flood control along the lower Rio Grande .
The USIBWC proposes to rehabilitate the Hidalgo Protective Levee
System within the Lower Rio Grande Flood Control Project (LRGFCP).
As currently designed, the proposed levee improvements consist of two
phases (Phase I and Phase II), each covering separate geographic areas of
the Hidalgo Protective Levee System and a proposed wetland mitigation
area located on the Hidalgo Bend National Wildlife Refuge property,
totaling approximately 83.24 acres.
The survey consisted of a
reconnaissance trenching and geomorphic study within the proposed
levee expansion footprint, supplemented by 100% pedestrian survey,
intensive shovel testing, and backhoe trenching in areas with a high
probability for historic or prehistoric resources. In addition, two areas
(HPA-1 and HPA-2) identified during NEPA studies for the Lower Rio
Grande Flood Control Project as having a high probability for buried
historic cultural resources were investigated during the current study. A
total of 35 shovel tests and 26 backhoe trenches were excavated along
the project corridor, with all being ne gative for cultural resources. A
geomorphologist identified the majority of the project area to be Modern
Alluvium (MA), except for two elevated scarps of Late Holocene Alluvium
(LHA) and Middle Holocene Alluvium (MHA) found in the Phase I and
Phase II areas. Both of the elevated scarp areas were subject to intensive
systematic archeological survey with subsurface testing according to
THC minimum survey standards.
No new archeological sites were
documented during the current survey.
Regulatory clearance for the entire surveyed area of the Hidalgo
Protective Levee System as mapped under the current investigations is
recommended.
Based on the results of shovel testing, trench
excavations, and the geomorphic characteristics of the project landscape,
it is recommended that the proposed project will have no adverse impacts
on any NRHP-eligible archeological sites or portions of sites within the
project Area of Potential Effect (APE). No further work is recommended
within the surveyed areas for this project. All project related documents
and materials will be professionally curated at the Center for
Archeological Resources (CAR) in San Antonio, Texas.

Introduction and Executive Summary

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Between November 12 â 21, 2006, Hicks & Company conducted a
combination reconnaissance and systematic cultural resources
investigation for the Hidalgo Protective Levee System Rehabilitation
Project in Hidalgo County, Texas on behalf of the United States Section,
International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC) (Figure 1).
The purpose of the archeological survey is to assist the USIBWC in
meeting its requirements under Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA). The survey was conducted under USIBWC
ARPA Permit No. 0012 (Archeological Resources Protection Act) to enable
survey on federal property. A USFWS Special Use Permit (No. 21551) was
obtained to conduct survey on the Hidalgo Bend NWR property. All work
complied with the guidelines set out under 36CFR800 which outlines the
procedures for Section 106 implementation and compliance and
consistent with the rules of practice and procedure for the Texas
Antiquities Code.
The project consists of raising the 4.5-mile Hidalgo Protective Levee
System to meet design requirements for flood control in the LRGFCP.
The USIBWC proposes to rehabilitate the Hidalgo Protective Levee
System within the Lower Rio Grande Flood Control Project (LRGFCP).
The Hidalgo Protective Levee System was identified as a priority area for
improvement by the LRGFCP since it does not meet current flood
protection criteria. The USIBWC has proposed to raise the existing levee
height ranging from 3 â 9 feet, depending on location, and expand the
levee footprint horizontally from 64 feet to approximately 100 feet in
width. The areas of proposed levee improvements continues downstream
of the Rio Grande beyond the Historic Hidalgo Pump House with the
southern terminus being located in an area south of Tejano Estates
Subdivision. The southern terminus area is bordered by the Hidalgo
Bend National Wildlife Refuge of the USFWS.
As currently de signed, the proposed levee improvements consist of two
phases, each covering separate geographic areas of the Hidalgo Protective
Levee System and a proposed wetland mitigation area in the Hidalgo
Bend NWR property.
The proposed expansion footprint totals
approximately 83.24 acres. The proposed project area is depicted on
Plates 1 and 3, (see Appendix A). Phase 1 entails increasing levee
height in the upstream 3.3-mile reach of the levee system, from Hidalgo
Levee junction with the LRGFCP Main Floodway, to the west margin of
the Hidalgo-Reynosa International Bridge. Phase 2 consists of partial
rerouting of the 1.2-mile downstream reach of the levee system.
Rerouting the levee system in this portion of the proposed project area
will eliminate the need for construction of a floodwall in front of the
Hidalgo Historic Pump House, which is a resource included in the
National Regi ster of Historic Places (NRHP).
A proposed wetland
mitigation area is located in the Hidalgo Bend National Wildlife Refuge of
the Lower Rio Grande Valley south of the Hidalgo Historic Pump House.
The wetland area is situated west of the international border station,
between levee miles 3.0 to 3.2; this easement is 26.98 acres in size.

Introduction and Executive Summary

A previous survey sponsored by the USIBWC and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers Galveston and Fort Worth Districts in 1999 near the proposed
project area made an attempt to assess the potential effects to historic
properties within the Lower Rio Grande Flood Control Project (Cooper et
al. 2003). Data obtained from this survey allowed Hicks & Company
archeologists to develop a predictive analysis model of areas having a
high probability for archeological sites within the proposed project area.
According to Cooper et al. (2003), there is a high potential for buried
prehistoric archeological deposits in areas adjacent to bancos and
resacas. Cooper et al. (2003) identifies two high probability areas (HPA-1
and HPA-2) within the proposed project area (Plates 2 and 3). The study
suggests that these areas were used by both prehistoric and historic
occupations. To date, the Cooper et al. report represents the best
archeological data documented within or near the proposed project area.
In coordination with the USIBWC and THC, Hicks & Company
archeologists conducted a reconnaissance trenching and geomorphic
study within the proposed levee footprint, supplemented with a 100%
pedestrian survey and intensive shovel testing and backhoe trenching in
areas having a high probability for historic and/or prehistoric resources.
The entire project area was inventoried for cultural resources. A total of
35 shovel tests and 26 backhoe trenches were excavated within the
project area, with none being positive for cultural resources. A review of
archival data at the Texas Arche ological Research Laboratory (TARL)
revealed no previously recorded archeological sites located within the
proposed levee expansion footprint.
Research of archival records
maintained by the NRHP and the Texas Historic Sites Atlas and data files
of archeological sites and surveys identified a single archeological site
(41HG180) located within a two-kilometer radius of the project area
(NRHP online 2006; TARL online 2006). Site 41HG180 is located well
outside of the project area and was not evaluated for cultural resources
during the current study. No new archeological sites were recorded
during the current survey. The survey took place on property owned by
the USIBWC, the City of Hidalgo, and the USFWS. Geological data
recovered from excavated shovel tests and backhoe trenches suggest that
most of the upper six feet of deposition within the project area is very
recent Holocene deposition except for two areas. The area located
between BHT2 and BHT4 and the area east of the Historic Hidalgo Pump
House were found by Charles Frederick, a geomorphologist, to be older
landforms that could possibly contain intact pockets of prehistoric
cultural material. It is important to point out that the current geologic
data is similar to that documented during the Cooper et al. (2003)
geoarcheological investigation of the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
No logistical difficulties were encountered during the survey. James
Karbula functioned as Principal Investigator for the project. Brian King
(Project Archeologist) and David Peyton conducted the survey. Charles
Frederick conducted the geological study. Mr. Isidirio Gomez operated
the backhoe. Kay Wolfe (Curator of the Hidalgo Pump House) provided
investigators with historic maps and archival information on the Pump
House. All project related records will be permanently housed at the
Center for Archeological Research (CAR), in San Antonio, Texas. This
report is offered in partial fulfillment of ARPA Permit No. 0012.

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located primarily in the Rio Grande Valley / South
Texas Brushlands of the Gulf Coastal Plains ecological or natural
subregion. The South Texas Brushlands occupy a large, wide, wedgeshaped plain in south Texas below the Balcones Escarpment, east of the
Rio Grande and west of the Blackland Prairies region (Telfair 1999). The
majority of the proposed project area has been cleared of all vegetation.
Areas adjacent to the levee expansion footprint are lined with mesquite acacia savannah or south Texas mesquite -scrub brush savannah,
recently plowed agricultural fields, and/or commercial development.
The existing Hidalgo levee is located in the Rio Grande floodplain. The
proposed levee expansion footprint area transects a single geological
formation: Alluvium. The alluvium is dominantly sand and silt deposits
from frequent flooding of the Rio Grande . The Rio Grande includes
sedimentary rocks from the Cretaceous and Tertiary Periods and a wide
variety of igneous and sedimentary rocks from Trans-Pecos Texas,
Mexico, and New Mexico (Fisher 1976).
Soils within all the proposed project area are mapped within the RioGrande -Matamoros Association. Soils in this association are located in
deep, moderately and slowly permeable soils. These soils consist of
nearly level soils on bottom lands with typical light-brownish gray or
grayish brown soil color. Rio Grande soils are located at higher elevations
than the nearly level lower positions of Matamoros soils. Rio Grande soils
typically have an eight inch thick gray silt loam surface layer underlain
by a brown silt loam to a depth of 65 inches. Matamoros soils have a
grayish brown silty clay surface layer eight inches thick underlain by
light brown gray or grayish brown silty clay to a depth of 65 inches.
Camargo soils are located in positions similar to Rio Grande soils. Grulla
soils are found in old river channels or oxbows. Zalla soils are typically
found in the inside meandering curves of the Rio Grande . Since irrigation
pump houses were built in the region in the early 1900âs, soils located in
the proposed project area are presently used for agricultural cropland. A
few areas having Zalla and Grulla soils are used as improved pasture or
for livestock grazing. Soils in the project area have a low potential for
urban or recreation usage because of hazardous flooding of the Rio
Grande . The majority of the project area is situated on Rio Grande soils.
Ground surface visibility in the proposed project area is poor (10%), with
little to no visibility observed by investigators.
The typical climate in Hidalgo County is a subtropical, subhumid climate
with mild winters and hot summers. Temperatures range from an
average minimum of 61Â° F in January to an average maximum of 95Â° F
in July. Rainfall within the Hidalgo County averages 23 inches a year
(Garza 2001).

VEGETATION, WILDLIFE, AND LAND USE
The project is located within the South Texas Plains Vegetational Area of
Texas (Gould 1962). This region includes most of southern Texas from
the Rio Grande to the Coastal Plains and extends on an east-west line

Archeological Survey â Hidalgo Levee â March 2007

Environmental Setting

between San Antonio and Del Rio. The climate of this region is described
as subtropical steppe and is characterized by semiarid to arid conditions
(Larkin and Bomar 1983).
The vegetational structure and relative
species composition of the South Texas Plains has changed drastically
over time. Historically, the dominant vegetation types were brushy
savannahs and grasslands. Increased grazing and the cessation of fire
have led to the spread of woody species from riparian areas and ridges to
all parts of the landscape (Inglis 1964). The proliferation of these woody
species has progressed to such an extent that the area is now commonly
referred to as the Brush Country of South Texas.
This vegetational area is further divided into two vegetation types as
described in âThe Vegetation Types of Texasâ (Frye 1984).
These
vegetation types are Mesquite -Blackbrush Brush and Crops. The
Mesquite -Blackbrush vegetation type is principally found on shallow,
gravelly or loamy soils. Examples of this type of vegetation observed in
the project area during survey include lotebush, desert olive, allthorn,
prickly pear cactus, yucca, and tasajillo. Cropland, as the name implies,
consists of cultivated cover crops or row crops providing food and/or
fiber for either man or domestic animals. This type may also portray
grassland associated with crop rotations (Frye 1984).
The fauna distributed here illuminates the transitional nature of the
province. There are considerable elements of neo-tropical species,
grassland species, and Chihuahuan desert species inhabiting the variety
of habitats present. Several species of mammals, snakes, lizards, and
anurans (frogs and toads), occur, or have recently occurred, in the
Tamaulipan province. Bird life is also diverse, with several species
documented at Falcon Lake State Park, located near Falcon Dam.
Perhaps the most noteworthy example of the local wildlife observed
during the survey was a rather large western diamondback rattlesnake,
encountered at an uncomfortably close distance.
Present day land use in the region is predominantly agricultural and
residential.
This includes single family residences, range land,
pastureland and crops. More urban and residential land uses are
concentrated in and around the cities of Roma and Rio Grande City. Oil
and gas production are found throughout the region, often at high
densities. Hunting of wildlife is of tremendous economic importance in
the region.
Recreational hunting for white-tailed deer, wild hogs,
bobwhite quail, and mourning and white -winged dove bring substantial
financial benefits to the local economy.

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The project corridor extends across the Rio Grande Plain biogeographical
subregion of the South Texas Plains archeological region as defined by
Black (1989). While the Rio Grande nominally defines the western and
southern border of most of this region, the river almost certainly did not
function as a cultural boundary in prehistoric times. In fact, the
northeastern areas within the Mexican states of Nuevo Leon and
Tamaulipas manifest prehistoric cultural materials that are strikingly
similar to those found in south Texas (He ster 1980). The South Texas
Plains archeological region is poorly understood, reflecting a paucity of
systematic excavations as well as the geomorphic characteristics the
landscape as they pertain to site formation processes.
The most
commonly recorded sites in south Texas are open occupation sites. In
some cases, meaningful excavation of these sites has proven to be a
challenge to archeologists (Hester 1995). This vexing situation stems
from the horizontal patterning of many open occupation sites in the
region. These sites tend to exist as laterally extensive occupation areas
with temporally separated components found across the area that are
also separated horizontally and rarely overlap (Hester 1995). Other open
occupation sites, especially in upland settings, occur on stable ancient
surfaces with very shallow or deflated cultural deposits that are virtually
impossible to conclusively attribute to a particular time period.
Comparatively few deeply stratified occupation sites have been excavated
in south Texas. Black posits that this is a result of both settlement
patterning and depositional context (Black 1989). Other site types
present in south Texas include lithic procurement and reduction sites,
rockshelters, artifact caches, and burials. Lithic procurement and
reduction sites are somewhat common and are typically found in upland
areas where chert resources in the form of Uvalde gravels occur.

SOUTH TEXAS CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Archeological evidence indicates that prehistoric occupations were
present in Hidalgo County, dating back 11,000 years. Cultural material
identified by previous investigations in the area indicate that the region
was inhabited early on by hunter and gatherers whose subsistence
strategy consisted of hunting big game and gathering plant fruits and
nuts; this semi-arid environment was not suitable for intensive
agricultural although an attempt to grow maize was attempted in the
region. The Archaic Period (6000 B.C. â A.D. 800) saw the shift from a
nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle to a less mobile more sedentary
subsistence strategy. There is little evidence of Early Archaic (6000 B.C.
â 2500 B.C.) and Middle Archaic (2500 â 400 B.C.) occupations in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley, with sites being found near the Coastal Bend of
south Texas. Late Archaic Period (400 B.C. âA.D. 800) sites are more
common within the Lower Rio Grande Valley. These sites are usually
found in association with Late Prehistoric Period assemblages. Cooper et
al. (2003) suggest most of the inland Late Archaic sites would have a
subsistence strategy based on collection rather than gathering. Small

mammals (rabbits, rodents, etc.) and different plant species would be
used for food. The Late Prehistoric Period (A.D. 800-1600) is the best
understood of all the prehistoric periods. These sites are more common
and, therefore, more radiocarbon data has been collected and analyzed
by researchers. MacNeish (1947, 1958, cited in Cooper et al. 2003)
defined the Barril complex and the Brownsville complex within the Lower
Rio Grande valley. The Barril complex slightly predates the Brownsville
complex (A.D. 800) with the Brownsville complex possibly extending into
the Historic Period. Both of these complexes are characterized by an
extensive shell industry, triangular arrow points, and Huastecan-like
ceramics (Cooper et al. 2003:37). The projectile point styles include
Matamoros, Fresno, Starr, and Cameron types. The Barril complex is
typically found south of the Rio Grande while the Brownsville complex is
found north of the Rio Grande. Cemeteries become more abundant in the
Late Prehistoric Period in the Lower Rio Grande valley. The Coahuilteco
and Karankawa were linguistic groups known to live in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley. Native American Indian subsistence strategies include
hunting a variety of animals, fish, and gathering of berries, fruits, and
roots. The Lipan Apaches relocated to this area from Colorado during
the 1700âs. The Comanches later moved into south Texas in the early
19th century. Agricultural practices were not widely used in this area
due to the lack of water for crops to survive. Based on these data, C ooper
et al. (2003) indicate that small seasonal prehistoric campsites would be
expected to be found near bancos or resacas left by the meanderi ng Rio
Grande. These areas are considered to have the highest probability for
prehistoric cultural material within the proposed project area.

HISTORIC PERIOD
The community of Hidalgo was established in 1852 and named for
Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, who gave the cry for Mexican Indepe ndence
from Spanish rule (Garza 2001). Early irrigation methods in the region
originated with the first Spanish settlers, but the fickle water levels and
flood behavior of the Rio Grande prevented the large-scale irrigation
required for successful farming. The coming of the railroad to Laredo and
the Lower Rio Grande Valley in the 1880s opened up new agricultural
possibilities. A citrus industry took root in the 1870s, and rapidly
expanded over the next several decades (Thompson 1994:69). The
railroads allowed for new irrigation technologies and equipment to reach
the Rio Grande, and by the late nineteenth century large -scale irrigation
was in place up and down the river. The irrigation canals and pump
houses helped turn a once dry and desolate scrub desert into what was
billed at the time as the âmagical valleyâ (Thompson 1994:71). The drop
in the water level of the river, however, spelled the end of the riverboat
traffic. By 1909 the river was all but non-navigable for anything but
small flatboats due to rapids and sandbars.
A levee system was first proposed in 1892 by W.H. Chatfield, an army
engineering officer at Fort Brown (Matthews 1938:53-54). Chatfieldâs
proposal, offered as a letter in a local newspaper, entailed buildi ng levees
around the resacas, connecting them via a series of canals and
floodgates. Water would enter the system during flood stages, to be held
and released as needed to help irrigate farmland. This would not only
provide irrigation for agriculture, but much-needed flood control as well.

Archeological Survey â Hidalgo Levee â March 2007

Cultural Background

Chatfieldâs proposal was not directly implemented, as other
entrepreneurs had already started setting up pumping and lift stations
along the river by this time, but a levee system was put in place
sometime in the first half of the twentieth century for flood control. A
pre-1933 map of the Rio Bravo Plantation Company lands and canals
shows no levee system in place, but this is not direct proof of a later
construction date; a levee along the western edge of Hidalgo does appear
on a 1949 map of the McAllen area.
George Brulay, the owner of a large plantation outside of Brownsville, is
commonly credited with being the first to pump water from the Rio
Grande for irrigation, in 1876 (Matthews 1938:55). John Closner was the
first to pump water in Hidalgo for his sugar cane plantation in 1895, just
east of the town (Matthews 1938:56). In 1904, Closner began the Rio
Grande Valley Reservoir and Irrigation Company, building canals for the
next four years (Louisiana--Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System
National Register Listing 1995). In 1909, the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal
Company organized, subsuming Closnerâs and building their first pump
house in 1909-1910 (Matthews 1938:68). This station, originally known
as the first lift station, is now known as the Historic Hidalgo Pump
house. Originally built on the banks of the Rio Grande, the 1933
Brownsville hurricane caused massive flooding that changed the course
of the river to its present location one half mile to the southwest. After
the hurricane, the existing intake inlet was dredged and reinforced so
that the pump house could still function.
As evidenced by the 1933 hurricane, the Rio Grande was highly
susceptible to course changes. The International Boundary and Water
Commission (IBWC) produced a series of reports, informally known as
âbanco books,â that mapped the course of the river every few years and
its most recent, previous course. The current levee walls roughly follow
the course of the river in 1903, but the river moved several times near
Hidalgo over the next three decades, wiping out a 1912 pump house west
of the town and culminating in the 1933 course change; the destroyed
pump house is most likely the historic remains found at Site 41HG180.
Historic maps suggest the McAllen Pump house was built after 1933,
and the current levee walls post-1956. The area around the Hidalgo
Historic Pump house was once land belonging to the King-Woods Oil
Company according to a 1949 map of the McAllen area, and would have
included pa rt of the distribution system for the Louisiana-Rio Grande
Canal Company in addition to agricultural land. Figure 2 is a scanned

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Research of archival records maintained by the NRHP and the Texas
Historic Sites Atlas and data files of archeological sites and surveys was
conducted within a two-kilometer radius of the proposed project area
(NRHP online 2006; TARL online 2006). One previously recorded
archeological site (41HG180) was recorded within the two kilometer
buffer zone. Site 41HG180 is a possible historic residential site that was
recorded in 1999 by Eben Cooper. The site was recorded during the 1999
Lower Rio Grande Survey (Cooper et al. 2003) conducted by Wendy Lopez
and Associates under subcontract to Geo-Marine, Inc. All cultural
artifacts were observed on the ground surface. Artifacts included brick
fragments and a small piece of clear-glazed earthenware . One brick
fragment contained an unidentified makerâs mark. Investigators believe
the site most likely dates from ca. 1918 to 1950. A local informant
reported that several Mexican âshacksâ were located in this area and they
manufactured bricks for a living. Site 41HG180 is located on the
floodplain of the Rio Grande and approximately 1.5 kilometers west of
the McAllen Pumping Station. The site was originally part of Mexico until
the United States Rio Grande channelization project ca. 1970 changed
the direction of the river cutting off two lobes of land that was old Mexico.
Further archeological work was recommended at Site 41HG180 to
determine its NRHP status.
Cooper et al. (2003) also recorded potential historic archeological
properties, previously recorded NRHP sites, and designated areas having
a high potential for archeological resources. There were seven areas
designated by Cooper et al. as having a potential for historic
archeological resources (16PA5, 16MI3, 16HI2, 16HI3, 16HI4, 16LM9,
and 16LM10). Potential archeological historic sites 16PA5, 16MI3, 16HI2,
16HI3, 16LM9, and 16LM10 were all located on 1916 USGS topographic
maps with their current status unknown to researchers. Potential
historic site 16PA5 appears to be impacted by the construction of the
main floodway (Cooper et al. 2003:B-14). Cooper et al. identified site
16HI4 as having a high potential for historic artifacts, however, this site
is actually the Old Historic Hidalgo Pump House that is already listed in
the NRHP (see below for summary of the Old Historic Hidalgo Pump
House). Another structure identified by Cooper et al. (2003) and Sanchez
(1994) is potential historic site MCAP which is identified as the remains
of a 1912 complete steam engine pumping station. It is unknown if any
portion of this structure still remains.
The three NRHP sites located near the proposed project area include the
Hidalgo Historic Pump House, the Old Hidalgo Courthouse and buildings
(includes the Hidalgo County Jail and the Hidalgo Post Office), and the
Old Hidalgo School. The Hidalgo Historic Pump House is a restored
historic structure listed in the National Register of Historic Places in
1991. The pump house is currently used as a museum documenting
irrigation history of the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The pump house is the
only remaining steam pump in the nation and is also listed as a Texas
Recorded Historic Landmark. The pump was built in 1909 to irrigate the
semi-arid Lower Rio Grande Valley, which was historically productive
only for livestock grazing. The pump distributed water to some 72,000

farms and agriculture boomed and the scenery changed from ranchland
to agricultural crops of orchards and cotton fields.
The Old Hidalgo School is thought to have been built in 1898. The
building is a two-story brick educational facility used for generations.
The first documented graduation was in 1922, with a class of three
students. The school has served the community of Hidalgo as a place of
education, shelter from hurricanes, floods, and many social functions.
The building was listed in the NRHP in 1979.
The old Hidalgo County Courthouse and buildings served as the Hidalgo
County Courthouse from its construction in 1886 until 1908, when the
county seat was moved to Chapin (later named Edinburg). The original
building was two-stories constructed from brick manufactured in nearby
Reynosa, Mexico. A fire in the early 20th century destroyed its cupola,
roof and second floor. After the building was no longer used as a
courthouse it was later used as an immigration and customs facility. The
Hidalgo Courthouse was recorded as a Texas Historic Landmark in 1963.
The historic courthouse complex also included the Hidalgo County Jail
and the Hidalgo Post Office. The Old Hidalgo County Jail was built in
1886 by S.W. Brooks, who also constructed the Old Hidalgo Courthouse.
The building served as a jail during a turbulent period in history, when
outlaw raids were still occurring in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The
building was also used to publish the city of Hidalgoâs first newspaper,
âThe Hidalgo Advanceâ from 1904 to 1908. The jail is a two-story
structure constructed of handmade brick. It served the city of Hidalgo as
a jail until the county seat was moved to Chapin (modern day Edinburg)
in 1908. The Old Hidalgo Jail was recorded as a Texas Historic
Landmark in 1984. The Hidalgo Post Office was built in 1889 and is the
oldest in existence. The structure was originally used as a general store
but also served as a post office until 1913. The post office was recorded
as a Texas Historic Landmark in 1965. The old Hidalgo County
Courthouse and buildings were listed in the NRHP in 1980.

PROBABILITY MODEL
A review of the archival files indicates that Cooper et al. (2003) conducted
an assessment of potential historic properties within the Lower Rio
Grande Valley for the USIBWC (LRGFCP). This report represents the best
archeological data documented within or near the proposed project area.
According to Cooper et al. (2003), there is a high potential for buried
archeological de posits in areas adjacent to bancos and resacas. The
study suggests that these areas were used by both prehistoric and
historic occupations. An intensive geoarcheological investigation of the
area indicates that the Rio Grande is a complex meanderbelt. Most near
surface sediments along the Rio Grande are extremely young deposits
having a low probability to contain potentially significant cultural
resources; however, the investigators also suggest that there are pockets
of intact soils that may exist and contain cultural resources within the
proposed project area. This premise is based on data obtained from the
excavation of 60 backhoe trenches along the Rio Grande . The data
collected from trench excavations indicate that the majority of nearsurface deposits along the river (< 2 meters) are very recent in age and
have a low probability of containing significant cultural deposits in good
context.
There is potential for unrecorded archeological resources to be present,
as most of the project area is completely unsurveyed. The current study
conducted by Hicks & Company personnel provides the results of a
detailed background predictive assessment for the potential for
archeological sites. The probability for prehistoric sites has been
determined by examining the geology, soils, topography, and river
drainages in the proposed project area. In addition to the archeological
file search, investigators relied heavily on the probability assessment and
geoarcheological investigations conducted by Cooper et al. (2003) as a
way to identify areas having a high probability for cultural resources.
Seven backhoe trenches were excavated by Cooper et al. (2003) within a
two-kilometer radius of the proposed project area (BHT-9.13, BHT-9.14,
BHT-10.17, BHT-10.18, BHT-11.15, BHT11.16, and BHT-12.19). Table 1
summarizes backhoe trenches excavated by Cooper et al. (2003:
Appendix C) during an intensive geoarcheological investigation near the
proposed project area. BHT-9.13 and BHT-9.14 were excavated at
archeological Site 41HG180. BHT-9.13 contained brick fragments to at
least 80 centimeters below the ground surface. BHT9.14 contained brick
fragments, plaster, and glass fragments to a depth of 45 centimeters
below ground surface. Current investigations suggest these historic
artifacts probably represent fill from earth movement associated with the
levee. BHT-12.19 was excavated west of the proposed wetland mitigation
area in the Hidalgo Bend National Wildlife Refuge. This trench was found
to be disturbed to a depth of 253 centimeters below ground surface.
Investigators found concrete, two strands of wire cable and a single piece
of brick between the depths of 35 to 176 centimeters below ground
surface. The trench was terminated at 253 centimeters below ground
surface when a concrete slab, modern bricks, glass fragments, and a
piece of a 7-UP bottle were encountered between 192-253 centimeters
below ground surface. The remaining four trenches excavated by Cooper
et al. (2003) were negative for cultural material.

Probability Model

In addition, a single radiocarbon sample was collected from BHT-10.17,
which is located within two-kilometers of the proposed project area. This
sample consisted of common charcoal or a black decaying organic
material collected between 285-295 centimeters (9.4 to 9.7 feet) below
ground surface. The sample yielded a conventional date of 1,710 +/- 30
B.P. (A.D. 250 to 410). This data suggests that there may be intact
pockets of buried cultural material dating to the Late Archaic Period (400
B.C. â A.D. 800) between 9 to 10 feet within the proposed project area
(Cooper et al. 2003:34).
A review of these backhoe trench data would suggest that Hicks &
Company personnel would expect to find the upper two-meters of
sediments to be very young recent deposition from the Rio Grande. Based
on radiocarbon data from BHT-10.17, investigators could expect to find
pockets of buried cultural material dating to the Late Archai c Period
between depths of 9 â 10 feet below the ground surface. Any historic sites
that have any contextual integrity would most likely be found on the
ground surface. The catastrophic flood in 1933 most likely destroyed and
buried any historic site having any archeological significance;
furthermore, any historic sites found would most likely be the result of
secondary deposition, hence, having poor contextual integrity and little
to no research value.
In the high probability assessment of the Lower Rio Grande Flood
Control Project report by Cooper et al. (2003), two high probability areas
(HPA-1 and HPA-2) were identified as having a possible intact historic
component (Plates 2 and 3). HPA-1 and HPA-2 were identified as
structures on a 1916 United States Geological Survey topographic map.
HPA-1 is located near the McAllen Pump House. No structure(s) exist in
this area now but historic cultural materials may remain. HPA-2 is
located near the Old Hidalgo Historic Pump House. Although no standing
structures are located in this area today, Cooper et al. considered this
area to have the potential for historic cultural material. Prehistoric
cultural material in both HPA-1 and HPA-2 were considered low since
geoarcheological investigations by Cooper et al. led them to suggest that
ground disturbance extending no more than six feet in depth ââ¦would
not likely impact significant archeological depositsâ¦â (Cooper et al.
2003:84-90). The current study has produced data consistent with
Cooper et al. (2003) findings.

SUMMARY OF PROBABILITY MODEL
In summary, Hicks & Company archeologists created a predictive
probability model in order to define areas having a high potential for
cultural resources within the proposed Hidalgo Protective Levee System
in Hidalgo County, Texas. An intensive geoarcheological investigation by
Cooper et al. (2003) indicates that the upper two-meters of deposition
within the proposed project area is very recent Holocene deposition from
frequent flooding of the Rio Grande as well as flooding caused by a
hurricane in 1933. The Rio Grande is an extremely complex meanderbelt
that has shifted course throughout history either by flooding, hurricanes,
or human intervention; the events that altered the course of the river left
behind bancos and resacas which, from an archeological perspective
have the highest potential for historic and prehistoric occupations.
Although Cooper et al. found that most of the project area is buried
under young deposition, they clearly state that pockets of intact
sediments with good contextual integrity exist and these most likely are
present around bancos and resacas. A single radiocarbon date obtained
by Cooper et al. (2003) near the project area in BHT-10.17 (285-295
centimeters below ground surface) suggest that these intact pockets may
date to the Late Archaic Period, especially along bancos and resacas. All
bancos and resacas located within the project area should be intensively
investigated for historic and prehistoric occupations. In addition, high
probability areas HPA-1 and HPA-2 were identified on 1916 USGS
topographic maps as areas having historic structures (Cooper et al.

Probability Model

2003). A review of the USGS topographic maps indicated that more
historic settlements may have been present in the vicinity of the
proposed project area, with only HPA-1 and HPA-2 being located within
the current study area (Cooper et al. 2003). Unfortunately, a review of
USGS topographic maps and 2003 aerial photography maps by Hicks &
Company investigators could not identify any bancos and resacas located
within the proposed project area.

GEOARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
By: Charles Frederick, Ph.D., P.G.

METHODS
At the time the geoarcheological fieldwork was performed, 16 of the 26
trenches were open (specifically, BHT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
18, 19, 21 and 22) and these were briefly cleaned, and a simple
stratigraphic sketch made. From these data the trenches were grouped
into deposits of similar age and depositional environment, and from
those groups one (or more) trenches in each group were described in
detail (see Trench Descriptions, below; Table 2). Three different age
deposits were identified during the field work (Modern Alluvium (MA),
Late Holocene Alluvium (LHA) and Middle Holocene Alluvium (MHA), see
discussion below). A total of eight trenches were thus described. For each
of those eight trenches, a single vertical column was picked with a knife
and shaved with a trowel, and then described. Each physically distinct
deposit (termed a zone) was described using the terminology of
Schoeneberger et al. (2002) and Birkeland (1999). Where multiple,
repetitive beds were present (as was often the case for the near channel
overbank facies of the Modern Alluvium) the deposits were groupe d for
descriptive purposes, and the depth of various beds was depicted on the
stratigraphic sketch.

STRATIGRAPHIC OVERVIEW
Four different deposits were observed in the field: 1) Fill; 2) Modern
alluvium (abbreviated MA); 3) Late Holocene alluvium (abbreviated LHA),
and 4) older (presumably Middle Holocene) alluvial deposits (abbreviated
MHA). The most prevalent were deposits associated with the modern
depositional regime, but several trenches penetrated a remnant of a late
Holocene alluvial deposit, and one trench revealed a slightly older alluvial
fill.
Fill

Several of the trenches described in detail contained recent fill which
appears to have been associated with construction of the levee. These
deposits typically exhibited heterogeneous lithology, often displayed

Archeological Survey â Hidalgo Levee â March 2007

19

Geoarcheological Investigations

lenticular or âsmearedâ beds, sometimes had rounded aggregates of soil
suspended in the matrix, and usually had a high density (firm to
extremely firm consistence). A few contained reworked historic age
cultural material (brick fragments, patinated glass, and plastic) and
charred zones. Where present, these sediments were the uppermost
deposit, and rested upon Modern Alluvium.
In areas away from the existing levee, several trenches exposed a thin
20-30 centimeter thick plow zone, but in a few cases this could not be
distinguished on the bases of the deposits alone, but was inferred from
the depth of recent age cultural material.
Modern Alluvium (MA)
The majority of the trenches exposed deposits which are effectively
modern in age. Although the precise age of these deposits is unknown
and certainly debatable, it is likely that they are no more than 1000
years old, and many (perhaps most) may be of historic age. The
demonstrably historic age deposits of the Rio Grande elsewhere in the
catchment are known for producing erroneously old bulk radiocarbon
ages (cf. Frederick 2006; Frederick 2004; Frederick and Higgins 1993),
and here in the delta, Cooper et al., (2003:84-89) suspected that their
bulk sediment dates were erroneously old but could not substantiate it.
At this time it is not possible to distinguish historic from recent
prehistoric deposits in the field, and for this reason all of these deposits
should be considered likely to bury and contain historic and Late
Prehistoric cultural material.
Deposits in this group share a number of attributes, which include a lack
of significant pedogenic alteration, and prominent and well preserved
bedding (both well-defined beds and sedimentary structures such as
horizontal and ripple laminations, and cross-bedding), and abrupt
boundaries. Slight pedogenic alteration was noted in these sediments in
the form of very infrequent calcium carbonate filaments, rare threads of
gypsum, reddish-brown coats lining pores and ped faces (oxidized
organic matter?), and yellowish brown mottles along bedding planes in
sandy deposits. Significant pedogenic alteration in the form of master
horizons such as A or B horizons were conspicuously absent.
The color of the modern deposits was strongly conditioned by the texture,
with coarser textured sediments being lighter colored, and finer textured
ones darker. In specific, sands ranged in color from light gray (10YR
7/2) to pale brown (10YR 6/3, meters) and very pale brown (10YR 7/3),
whereas sandy loams and loamy sands were generally pale brown (10YR
6/3), brown (10YR 5/3), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4). Loamy deposits
(loam, silt loam and silt) were generally a slightly darker colored brown
(10YR 5/3 to 10YR 4/2). Muds (silty clay, silty clay loam and clay) were
most often brown (10YR 4/2) but massive muds in channel plug-like
deposits were usually a slightly lighter colored light brownish gray (10YR
5/2).
Modern alluvial deposits were typically observed beneath recent Fill and
resting upon Late Holocene Alluvium.

Geoarcheological Investigations

Late Holocene Alluvium (LHA)
Several trenches penetrated a remnant of what is inferred to be Late
Holocene alluvium. These deposits were all from the same general
depositional setting, namely a medial to distal floodplain environment
and consisted of a series of stacked, weakly-developed floodplain soils
formed in medium to thick fining upward beds which were sandy to
loamy at their base and silty clay to clay at the top. The tops of these
beds were generally darker colored than the demonstrably unaltered
floodplain muds in the Modern Alluvium (even when yielding the same
Munsell color), and were therefore recognized as A horizons. These soils
exhibited A-C profiles.
The LHA deposits differed from the Modern Alluvium deposits in several
ways. First, only the base of the fining upward beds were abrupt, and
within a single fining upward bed internal boundaries were either clear
or gradual.
Second, these deposits lacked sedimentary structures.
Third, nearly all of the fine -grained deposits exhibited calcium carbonate
filaments. And finally, terrestrial gastropods (specifically Rabdotus sp.)
were common within the LHA deposits, and only rarely encountered in
the Modern alluvium.
The coarse -textured basal part of the fining upward beds were typically
sandy loam, loam to silt loam, with colors ranging from pale brown (10YR
6/3) to brown (10YR 4/3) to yellowish brown (10YR 5/4).
The fine -grained upper parts of these beds, which had been
pedogenically altered to form A horizons, ranged in texture from silt loam
to silty clay loam, and were either very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or
brown (10YR 4/3).
The Late Holocene alluvial deposits were overlain by Modern Alluvial
deposits in two trenches, and appeared to rest on a truncated, older,
presumably Middle Holocene, rubified alluvial deposit at depth. The age
of this deposit is presently assumed rather than demonstrated, but it
would seem likely that these sediments hold the potential for buried
cultural material ranging in age from Late Prehistoric through Late
Archaic. Older materials may be present at depth depending upon the
actual age of the unit.
Middle Holocene Alluvium (MHA)
One trench encountered what appeared to be a complete profile of an
older alluvial deposit (BHT-21) which exhibited an A-AB-Bk-C soil profile
and fragments of a similar colored deposit were observed beneath the
LHA at the base of two trenches (BHT-3 and BHT-22). The relative
stratigraphic position of this deposit (beneath a higher terrace, and
stratigraphically beneath LHA) together with the fact that it was rubified
(exhibited 7.5YR hues) suggest that this alluvial deposit is older than the
Late Holocene Alluvium. In terms of stratigraphic position, the complete
profile was observed on a terrace surface that stands several meters
above the modern floodplain (the same surface the Pharr-San Juan
pump station is built on), and the absence of a recognizable drape of
Modern Alluvium on this profile suggests that this surface may only
rarely be inundated.
It is possible that the brick in the top 30

centimeters of BHT-21 may actually be buried by a drape of Modern
Alluvium which is, in this setting, part of cumulic A horizon, but if this is
the case, the Modern Alluvium here bears none of its classic attributes
described in detail above.
Although this deposit is here described as Middle Holocene age, the true
age of this deposit is unknown, and itâs age is estimated on the basis of
its degree of soil development.

GEOLOGIC SUMMARY
The landscape traversed by the project in the vici nity of Hidalgo is at the
upper (western) end of what the Bureau of Economic Geology has
mapped as the Holocene floodplain deposits of the Rio Grande delta (BEG
1976).
Geomorphology
There are at least two constructional geomorphic surfaces within the
project area, but the degree of landscape modification associated with
agriculture, urbanism and the levee construction have altered the
landscape enough to make sorting out the original topography rather
challenging. The modern floodplain of the Rio Grande is separated from
an elevated terrace by about a four meter scarp. This scarp was quite
well expressed in the vicinity of Trenches 2, 3, 22, and 23. Another
scarp (possibly the same one) separates the old town of Hidalgo, near the
Pharr-San Juan Pump Station from the floodplain to the north. Trench
21 is situated on this higher surface, whereas nearby Trench 9 is clearly
on the floodplain. It is possible that these are two different surfaces with
slightly different relative elevations (the one near the pump station being
slightly higher than the other), but that could not be confirmed with the
data obtained during fieldwork.
The Bureau of Economic Geologyâs map of this landscape is based
primarily upon lithology, and they recognize two different terrains in the
project area: 1) sandy alluvium (BEG map unit Qas) and 2) muddy
alluvium (BEG map unit Qam). Most of the project area (specifically the
modern Rio Grande floodplain) is mapped as sandy alluvium whereas the
higher surface underlain by the older alluvial deposits is mapped as
muddy alluvium. It may be in part the elevational difference that
underlies the BEG mapping of this landscape, but from the results of
this project it is apparent that there is considerable temporal complexity
to these deposits that is not depicted on the BEG maps.
Figure 3 shows the location of the trenches and the inferred age of the
deposits, and this clearly shows the location of the higher surface(s)
which are underlain by older alluvial deposits. The old town of Hida lgo
is situated on the leading edge of a bit of higher ground which is
underlain by older alluvial deposits, and bordered on the south by the
modern Rio Grande floodplain. The western edge of this elevated area
roughly parallels Highway 281 north of Hidalgo, and then turns
southeast immediately south of Hidalgo and the Pharr-San Juan Pump
Station. The canal from the pump station hugs the leading edge of the
scarp which separates this higher surface from the floodplain.

The scarp separating the floodplain from this elevated surface was
particularly clear in the vicinity of Trenches 2, 3, 22 and 23. In part of
this area the levee parallels the scarp and is situated on the higher
surface. The spatial distribution of the modern alluvial deposits on the
leading edge of this surface suggests that modern floods have submerged
the margins of it, but the core has probably only rarely been inundated.
Figure 4 illustrates a hypothetical cross-section showing the relative
stratigraphic position of the deposits described above. Obviously, the
thickness of most units is highly conjectural, except where the Late
Holocene Alluvium (LHA) rests upon the beveled edge of the Middle
Holocene Alluvium (MHA), which was directly observed in several
trenches. But given the LHA deposits are a medial to distal floodplain
facies, it is likely that this unit is considerably thicker elsewhere, outside
of the project area and what is preserved here is the valley margin
portion of this deposit.
Within each of these macro-depositional units are a myriad of alluvial
facies typically associated with meandering streams and which are fairly
well represented by the Modern Alluvium deposits exposed during
trenching. The three-dimensional geometry of these deposits is, if the
Modern Alluvium is a representative example, likely to be tremendously
complex. Although the majority of the Modern alluvial deposits exposed
during trenching were associated with vertical accretion, the deeper
deposits of this unit undoubtedly are dominated by lateral accretion
deposits associated with channel and point bar facies.
Trench Descriptions
Trench 2: Late Holocene Middle Floodplain Facies
Comment: The top 57 centimeters in this trench appeared to be fill
introduced to make the levee, and it rested unconformably upon a
roughly three meters thick section of Late Holocene alluvial deposits.
The latter consists of a series of stacked, weakly developed paleosols
which appear to have formed in a medial to distal floodplain depositional
environment that experienced episodic sedimentation. This deposit is
inferred to be of Late Holocene age on the basis of the lack of
rubification, and weakly expressed soil morphology.
Although no
radiocarbon dates are available for this deposit, the appearance of this
fill suggests that Late Archaic and possibly Late Prehistoric occupations
may be present within it.

Trench 3: Modern Near channel overbank facies overlying Late Holocene Middle
Floodplain Facies
Comment: At the very base of this trench is a slightly rubified deposit
which may be an older depositional unit (provisionally identified as
MHA), but the majority of the deposits exposed here, like Trench 2, are
thought to be of Late Holocene age, and draped by a thin veneer of recent
floodplain sediment (Zone 2). Zone 2 is a composite of slack water
deposits (SWDâs, or event specific overbank flood couplets; cf. Kochel and
Baker 1988; Jarrett and England 2002), where Zone 2a represents the
fine -textured or mud part of the couplet, and Zone 2b represents the
basal coarse fractions. Zone 1 appears to be recent fill.

Trench 4: Modern near channel overbank facies
Comment: The top 83 centimeters of this trench appears to be
construction fill associated with the levee. All of the deposits below that
are Modern Alluvium, but there appears to be a shift in facies from point
bar related deposits in the lowest meter, to near channel overbank
deposits (slack water sediments) between 85 and 200 centimeters depth.
The slack water sediments comprise Zones 2 and 3, and these are
composite zones where repetitive bedding was present. Zone 3 was
dominantly fine sediment with a few thin sand beds, whereas Zone 2 was
almost equal amounts of fine and coarse sediment. See graphic for
relative thickness and frequency of the various beds. The probability of
cultural deposits between 2-3 meters is unlikely given its apparent
landscape setting, but they could easily be present in the slack water
sediments which rest on the point bar deposits.

Trench 5: Modern Channel Facies
Comment: This trench exposed a Modern Alluvium channel deposit
which experienced flow to the east, roughly perpendicular to the levee.
The presence of a massive mud at the base of the trench (reminiscent of
a channel plug) may indicate that this shallow channel deposit
represents reactivation of an older, now largely filled abandoned channel.
The likelihood of encountering cultural deposits in this trench is very
low, given the high energy depositional environment it represents.

Trench 9: Modern Channel Plug Facies?
Comment: The Modern Alluvium deposits in this trench consisted of
numerous variable thickness beds of slack water sediments. The upper
half of the trench (zones 2a, 2b and 2c) is dominated by sands with
occasional thin mud drapes, whereas the lower half of the trench (zones
3a and 3b) is dominated by muds within which only a few thin sand beds
are preserved. The general trend therefore is from fairly low energy
deposition (most likely an ephemeral pond or slough) to one of
increasingly higher energy floods. Although the deposit appears to be of
the right age to harbor Late Prehistoric and/or Modern occupations, the
probability of such occupations in the lower half of the trench is unlikely
given that this appears to have been a fairly wet setting. The potential of
occupation is probably better in the upper half where this surface was
incrementally flooded rather than the scene of long term inundation.

Trench 12: Modern Near Channel Overbank to Point Bar Facies
Comment: All of the deposits exposed by this trench are of Modern age.
The top 60 centimeters of this trench exhibited slack water sediments
deposited in a near channel setting, and below this the deposits were
point bar sands which exhibited various sedimentary structures. All of
the deposit below 60 centimeters were associated with high energy
flooding, and for this reason cultural deposits are considered unlikely.

Trench 21: Middle Holocene (?) Floodplain Facies
Comment: This appears to be an older floodplain deposit with two
distinct facies present: a near channel sand, which is overlain by massive
floodplain mud. The rubified color (7.5YR hue) is distinctly different from
all of the Late Holocene and Modern deposits, and it is provisionally
inferred to be of middle Holocene age on the basis of soil development,
although its actual age is presently unknown. The presence of brick
fragments around 30 centimeters may indicate that the A horizon has
been a cumulic feature during the historic period, or it may also be an
artifact of cultivation, although no plow zone was observed. There was a
conspicuous line of terrestrial snails around 70 centimeters depth which
was potentially associated with a prehistoric occupation but picking the
walls of the trench at this elevation failed to turn up any cultural
material. The sand at the base of the trench exhibited faint evidence of
bedding, but probably represents a high energy depositional setting and
is unlikely to prehistoric contain cultural material in primary context.

Trench 22:
Modern Near Channel Overbank Facies Resting Upon Late
Holocene Floodplain Facies
Comment: This trench has a 1.2 meters thick drape of modern
floodplain slack water sediments which rest upon presumed late
Holocene floodplain deposits within which several weakly developed soils
have formed. The late Holocene deposits appear to drape a truncated
older deposit (middle Holocene alluvium?) around 2.8 meters depth, and
in this regard the stratigraphy of this trench is very similar to Trench 3.
This trench holds the potential for cultural material in primary context
from the Middle Holocene to the present, although the deposition of the
sediments was undoubtedly episodic rather than continuous.

Results of Field Investigations

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a pedestrian archeological
survey supplemented with shovel testing and mechanical backhoe
trenching for the proposed Hidalgo Protective Levee System project
(Figure 1). The investigators inventoried the entire project area for
cultural resources (Phase I, Phase II, the Hidalgo Bend Wetland
Mitigation Area, HPA-1, and HPA-2). The proposed expansion footprint
totals approximately 83.24 acres. The proposed project area is depicted
on Plates 1 â 3.
A total of 35 shovel tests and 26 backhoe trenches were excavated along
the project corridor, with all being negative for cultural resources.
Shovel tests were distributed at approximately 100-meter (325 feet)
intervals, approximately 16 per mile, in only those areas having a high
probability for cultural resources. All shovel tests were terminated at a
depth of 100 centimeters below ground surface. Additionally, no fewer
than six shovel tests were excavated at each high probability area (HPA-1
and HPA-2) in order to evaluate the area in terms of context, depth,
content, and definitive characteristics. All excavated soil was screened
through Â¼-inch wire mesh. Each shovel test was recorded in 10centimeter levels on standardized forms and plotted onto a site sketch
map and/or an aerial photograph of the project area. The walls and
bottom of each shovel test were cleaned with a trowel to examine the
stratigraphy and any evidence of historic and prehistoric activity; a soil
profile was recorded for each shovel test. Once these data were recorded,
all of the shovel tests were backfilled. The results of each shovel test were
documented through standardized forms, field notes, and photographs.
Areas of disturbance were noted and recorded through photographs. No
archeological cultural material was recovered during the current study.
Backhoe excavations were designed to remove consecutive layers of earth
in-order-to locate and expose cultural features or occupation levels
within the floodplain of the Rio Grande. The backhoe employed a
toothless bucket to aid in locating anomalies and/or features. All of the
backhoe trenches were excavated to a depth of 12 feet as outlined in the
scope of work. Backhoe excavations were directed and monitored by an
archeologist certified as a competent person trained in OSHA trench
safety standards. Each backhoe trench was recorded on a standardize
form, with notes made for stratigraphy, features, and cultural artifacts.
A soil profile, plan view map, and photographs were recorded for each
trench. After these data were recorded, the backhoe trenches were
backfilled. No cultural material was observed in any of the excavated
backhoe trenches.
Investigators initially conducted a reconnaissance trenching and
geomorphic study within the proposed levee expansion footprint. These
trenches were spaced approximately 200 â 250 meters (656 â 820 feet)
apart along the Phase I and Phase II footprint and left open for a
geomorphologist to later record.
Charles Frederick conducted
geoarcheological investigations for 16 of the 26 excavated trenches. The
geomorphologist identified the majority of the project area to be very
young recent deposition from the Rio Grande except in two specific areas
within the Phase I and Phase II areas. These younger areas of the

modern floodplain of the Rio Grande were labeled âMAâ (Modern
Alluvium). The age of the majority of MA sediments is estimated to be
very recent deposition spanning from 50 to several hundred years ago, or
historic in age. Frede rick found that the modern floodplain of the Rio
Grande was separated by an elevated terrace by about a four meter
scarp. Frederick identified two scarps within the project area which
investigators considered to have a high probability for buried prehistoric
cultural material. One scarp was identified as primarily Late Holocene
Alluvium (LHA) between Backhoe Trenches 2, 3, 22, and 23 within the
Phase I area. Another scarp, possibly the same scarp, was found east of
the Old Historic Hidalgo Pump House consisting of an elevated Middle
Holocene Alluvium (MHA) terrace within the Phase II area. Backhoe
Trenches 21 and 9 were observed by Frederick , with BHT 9 being clearly
located within the floodplain of the Rio Grande (MA) and BHT 21 being
situated on the higher older MHA terrace.
The two elevated terraces were considered by investigators to have a high
probability for buried prehistoric cultural material and were subject to
intensive archeological survey. The two areas found to have LHA and
MHA deposition were targeted by archeologists with systematically
spaced shovel tests (approximately 100 meter intervals, 16 per mile ) and
additional trench excavations to investigate for intact subsurface cultural
deposits (Plates 1 â 3). In addition, the high probability areas (HPA-1
and HPA-2) identified by Cooper et al. (2003) had a minimum of six
shovel tests excavated to explore for intact subsurface cultural deposits.
Backhoe Trench 3 was excavated in HPA-1 while BHT 21, 25, and 26
were excavated in HPA-2. A typical shovel test profile excavated within
the proposed right-of-way consistently revealed disturbed soils in the
upper two-feet underlain by recent Holocene deposition. Navigation
along the proposed project corridor was guided by a Trimble XT GPS unit
and detailed maps provided by the USIBWC. All GPS positions were
downloaded and plotted on aerial maps by Hicks & Company GIS
personnel.

SURVEY NARRATIVE
The field survey started at the northern terminus of the project area from
the junction with the main floodway (Common Levee). Archeologists
continued surveying the Phase I area in a southerly direction ending at
the International Hidalgo Bridge. At this point, archeologists worked in
the Phase II area traveling in an easterly direction passing the Old
Hidalgo Pump House, with the project ending at the southern terminus
near Lake Texano. The southern terminus area is bordered by the
Hidalgo Bend National Wildlife Refuge of the USFWS, which contains the
proposed Hidalgo Wetland Mitigation Area.
The Hidalgo Wetland
Mitigation Area was subject to backhoe trench excavations to investigate
for buried cultural resources. Shovel tests and backhoe trenche s were
excavated in high probability areas, specifically targe ting areas in HPA-1,
HPA-2, and within the two elevated scarps identified by a
geomorphologist containing Late Holocene Alluvium (Phase I Area) and
Middle Holocene Alluvium (Phase II Area) (Plates 1-3). As previously
mentioned, a review of archeological records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) revealed no previously recorded sites located
within the proposed right-of-way.
No new archeological sites were

documented during the current study.
A summary of the
reconnaissance trenching and geomorphic study as well as shovel tests
and trenches excavated within the Phase I area, Phase II area, Hidalgo
Bend Wetland Mitigation Area, HPA-1, and HPA-2 follows.

PHASE I AREA AND HPA-1 SUMMARY
Investigators excavated a total of 21 shovel tests (ST 15 â 35) and 11
backhoe trenches (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 22, 23, and 24) within the Phase I
area (Plates 1 â 2). During the reconnaissance and geomorphic study,
eight backhoe trenches (BHT1 â BHT8) were excavated and left open to
be analyzed by Charles Frederick, a geomorphologist.
Frederick
identified an elevated four meter scarp consisting primarily of Late
Holocene Alluvium (LHA) between BHT2 and BHT3. Both BHT1 and
BHT4 contain Modern Alluvium (MA), which suggests that the LHA scarp
remnant present within the APE lies between BHT1 and BHT4. This
pocket of LHA was considered by investigators to have a high probability
for buried prehistoric cultural material.
At this point, investigators decided to systematically survey the elevated
scarp surrounding BHT2 and BHT4 to investigate for buried prehistoric
cultural material. Two additional trenches (BHT 22 and 23) were
excavated in this area so systematic intervals between each trench
excavated along the elevated LHA scarp were between 200 â 250 meters
apart. Furthermore, researchers excavated 21 shovel tests (ST 15 â 35)
at 100 meter intervals (325 feet) from approximately 300 meters north of
BHT 2 and 100 meters south of BHT 4, to locate any buried cultural
material. Figure 5 is a photograph of BHT3 but also is a representative
picture of all the trenches excavated in the Phase I area. Figure 6
illustrates the typical soil profiles documented by the geomorphologist in
Backhoe Trenches 2, 3, 4, 5, and 22 excavated along the Phase I corridor
(See Geoarcheological Investigation section for detailed trench
descriptions). All of these trenches were excavated to a depth of 12 feet
before being terminated. The trenches were placed on the east and west
sides of the existing levee system between the junction with the main
floodway (Common Levee) downstream to the Hidalgo Reynosa
International Bridges. The upper 2-3 feet were consistently observed to
be disturbed by levee construction activities.
The high probability area HPA-1, which is located in the Phase I area,
was specifically targeted by archeologists to investigate for buried historic
cultural material. HPA-1 is located near the Old McAllen Pump Station
(Figure 7) located approximately 175 meters to the west of the proposed
project area (Plate 2). This area was considered high probability since a
1916 historic map depicted a structure in the vicinity of the proposed
project area.
Six of the 21 shovel tests (ST 15 â 19 and 30) were
specifically excavated within HPA-1 to investigate for any historic or
prehistoric cultural material. No cultural material was documented in
any of the shovel tests or trenches excavated within the Phase I area and
HPA-1. No further work is recommended.

PHASE II AREA
Investigators excavated 14 shovel tests and seven ba ckhoe trenches
within the Phase II area (Plate 3). The Phase II area starts at the Hidalgo
Reynosa International bridges moving in an easterly direction until
terminating at the eastern terminus of Lake Texano. The Phase II levee
new location expansion area runs adjacent to the Hidalgo Bend National
Wildlife Refuge, which contains the Hidalgo Bend Wetland Mitigation
Area and is property owned by the City of Hidalgo. Backhoe Trenches 9,
10, 11, 12, and 21 were excavated and left open during the
reconnaissance survey, with BHT 9 being specifically excavated within
the vicinity of the Old Historic Hidalgo Pump House. Charles Frederick,
a geomorphologist, analyzed all five trenches excavated during the
reconnaissance survey. As previously mentioned, Frederick identified an
elevated scarp with Middle Holocene Alluvium (MHA) east of the Old
Hidalgo Pump House and Modern Alluvium (MA) west of the pump
house. Based on these findings, the Principal Investigator made a
decision to systematically survey the entire levee expansion footprint in
the Phase II area. Shovel Tests 1 â 14 were systematically excavated
along the Phase II corridor at 100-meter (325 feet, 16 per mile ) intervals
to investigate for buried historic and prehistoric cultural materials.
Additional backhoe trenches (BHT 25 and 26) were excavated on the
Middle Holocene Alluvium scarp. The interval distance between BHT 25
and BHT 21 was approximately 250 meters (820 feet). Backhoe Trench
26 was placed approximately 75 meters (246 feet) from BHT 21 at the
edge of rising topography and dense vegetation. Shovel tests east of BHT
26 revealed disturbed soils from past levee construction activities.
Figure 8 is a photograph of BHT 9 and represents a typical excavated
trench in the Phase II area. Figure 9 illustrates the typical soil profile
documented by the geomorphologist in Backhoe Trenches 9, 12, and 21

excavated along the Phase II corridor. Each trench was excavated to a
depth of 12 or more feet as indicated in the scope of work before being
terminated. Modern Alluvium (MA) found within the Phase II area is
similar to that found in the Phase I area. Frederick points out that the
elevated Middle Holocene Alluvial scarp in the eastern portion of the
Phase II area may possibly be apart of the same Late Holocene Alluvial
scarp found in the Phase I area; unfortunately, based on data
documented during the current study there is not enough evidence to
validate this theory (See Geoarcheological Investigation section for
detailed trench descriptions).
Figure 8 Representative photograph of BHT9 excavated within the Phase I area and
HPA-1, facing south.

Investigators observed and documented a historic irrigation well and
pipes within the wetland area (Figure 10; Plate 3). A small trench cut
was made adjacent to the irrigation well to see how deep recent alluvial
deposition was within the area. Figure 11 depicts the exposed stone
irri gation pipe exposed near the surface in the trench cut, which
suggests that little to no alluvial deposition has occurred within the
proposed wetland area since the irrigation system was built post 1930âs.
A 1954 map of the Hidalgo County Water Improvement District No. 2
does not depict the irrigation well and pipes as part of the original
National Register-listed Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation
System Historic District, which includes the Old Historic Hidalgo Pump
House. The boundaries of the district are limited to the original 45,000
acres of the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company lands, which do not
include the proposed Hidalgo Bend Wetland Mitigation Area.
The
existing irrigation well was most likely constructed as part of a privately
owned field irrigation ditch.
These types of irrigation wells are
ubiquitous in the region and this particular well is in a state of neglect
and disrepair.

HIDALGO BEND WETLAND MITIGATION AREA SUMMARY
Hicks & Company archeologists excavated eight backhoe trenches within
the proposed Hidalgo Bend Wetland Area, situated within the Hidalgo
Bend National Wildlife Refuge (Plate 3). The wetland area is located west
of the international Hidalgo/Reynosa bridges and south of the existing
Hidalgo levee footprint, between the levee miles 3.0 to 3.2; the proposed
Hidalgo Bend Wetland Area totals approximately 26.98 acres. Combined
with trenches excavated in the adjacent Phase II area (BHT 9-12) a total
of 12 trenches were excavated between the canal and the Rio Grande,
subsuming the wetland mitigation area.
A total of 3.42 acres
immediately adjacent to the Rio Grande were identified as low probability
modern channel deposits and not trenched. As outlined in the scope of
work, backhoe trenches were excavated at approximately one every two
acres within the remaining 23.56 acres of proposed Hidalgo Bend
Wetland Mitigation Area. Backhoe Trenches 13 â 20 were excavated
during the reconnaissance survey and were analyzed by Charles
Frederick during the geomorphic study. As documented in trenches
excavated in the Phase I and Phase II areas, the typical stratigraphy
recorded in each of these trenches contained Modern Alluvium (MA) (See
Geoarcheological Investigation section for detailed trench descriptions). A
review of old irrigation maps obtained from the Old Hidalgo Pump House
Museum and data obtained from the eight excavated backhoe trenches
suggests that the proposed Hidalgo Bend Wetland Mitigation Area is in
fact the previous channel of the Rio Grande that was subsequently filled
by modern fill; the catastrophic hurricane of 1933 altered the course of
the Rio Grande to its present day location. In result, the proposed
wetland mitigation area represents post 1933 deposition, and zero
probability for buried prehistoric archeological sites. In addition, there is
minimal potential for historic sites to be found in the wetland area due to
frequent seasonal flooding from the Rio Grande. No cultural material
was encountered in any of the trenches excavated in the proposed
Hidalgo Bend Wetland Mitigation Area.
No further work is
recommended.

HPA-2 SUMMARY
As previously mentioned, Cooper et al. (2003) identified a high
probability area (HPA-2) just south and east of the existing Old Hidalgo
Pump House (Plate 3). Cooper et al. (2003) during a high probability
study of the Lower Rio Grande Valley considered this area have a high
probability for archeological sites since a historic 1916 map depicted a
structure within or near this area. Hicks & Company investigators
conducted additional archival and map research and now believe the
structure on the 1916 map was in fact the existing Old Historic Hidalgo
Pump House. Since Charles Frederick identified the majority of the HPA2 area was located on an elevated Middle Holocene Alluvial scarp, as
described in the Phase II Summary, investigators decided to
systematically survey the entire area for buried historic and prehistoric
cultural resources. Shovel Tests 8 â 14 and Backhoe Trenches 21, 25,
and 26 were excavated within the HPA-2 area. Shovel Test 8 contained
Modern Alluvium (MA) similar to that found in BHT 9. Shovel Test 9 and
BHT 25 revealed an elevated scarp containing Middle Holocene Alluvium
to the east. Figure 12 depicts the vegetation encountered in the Phase II
area. No cultural material was documented in any of the shovel tests or
trenches excavated within the HPA-2 area. No further work is
recommended.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Between November 12â21, 2006, Hicks & Company archeologists
conducted a combination reconnaissance and systematic cultural
resources investigation for the Hidalgo Protective Levee System
Rehabilitation Project in Hidalgo County, Texas on behalf of the United
States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission
(USIBWC).
In coordination with the USIBWC and THC, Hicks &
Company archeologists conducted a reconnaissance trenching and
geomorphic study within the proposed levee footprint, supplemented with
a 100% pedestrian survey and intensive shovel testing and backhoe
trenching in areas having a high probability for historic and/or
prehistoric resources. The purpose of the archeological survey is to
assist the USIBWC in meeting its requirements under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The survey was conducted
under USIBWC ARPA Permit No. 0012 (Archeological Resources
Protection Act) to enable survey on federal property. A USFWS Special
Use Permit (No. 21551) was obtained to conduct survey on the Hidalgo
Bend NWR property. All work complied with the guidelines set out under
36CFR800 which outlines the procedures for Section 106
implementation and compliance and is consistent with the THC
minimum survey standards in high probability areas, and the rules of
practice and procedure for the Texas Antiquities Code.
The project consists of raising the 4.5-mile Hidalgo Protective Levee
System to meet design requirements for flood control in the LRGFCP.
The USIBWC proposes to rehabilitate the Hidalgo Protective Levee
System within the Lower Rio Grande Flood Control Project (LRGFCP). As
currently designed, the proposed levee improvements consist of two
phases, each covering separate geographic areas of the Hidalgo Protective
Levee System and a proposed wetland mitigation area in the Hidalgo
Bend NWR property, totaling approximately 83.24 acres. In addition,
previous research by Cooper et al. (2003) identified two areas (HPA-1 and
HPA-2) having a high probability for cultural resources within the project
area.
The entire proposed project area was surveyed by Hicks &
Company archeologists for cultural resources. A total of 35 shovel tests
and 26 backhoe trenches were excavated along the project corridor, with
all being negative for cultural resources. Charles Frederick conducted
the geomorphic study and identified a pocket of Late Holocene Alluvial
scarp in the Phase I area and a Middle Holocene scarp east of the Old
Hidalgo Pump House in the Phase II area. All other areas were identified
by Frederick as Modern Alluvium (MA). These findi ngs are similar to
those found by Cooper et al. (2003) during their survey of the Lower Rio
Grande Valley. Shovel tests were systematically excavated in both of the
scarps identified by Frederick to have older sediments (LHA and MHA).
The majority of MA sediments are estimated to be 50 to several hundred
years old, or more (historic age). No new archeological sites were
documented during the current survey. A historic irrigation well and
pipes were documented in the Phase II levee expansion area, adjacent to
the proposed Hidalgo Bend Mitigation Area. As discussed in the Results
of Field Investigations the Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company
Irrigation System Historic District NRHP nomination indicates that the
privately owned pipe and irrigation ditch features are noncontributing to
the Historic District. In addition, the irrigation well and pipes have no

known significant associations, are ubiquitous throughout the region,
generally poorly preserved and, therefore, they are not considered eligible
to be listed in the NRHP. No further work is recommended.
Regulatory clearance for the entire surveyed area of the Hidalgo
Protective Levee System as mapped under the current investigations is
recommended.
Based on the results of shovel testing, trench
excavations, and the geomorphic characteristics of the project landscape,
it is recommended that the proposed project will have no adverse impacts
on any NRHP-eligible archeological sites or portions of sites within the
project Area of Potential Effect (APE).
No further archeological
investigations or cultural resource coordination pertaining to
archeological sites are recommended within the surveyed areas for this
project.
All project related documents and materials will be
professionally curated at the Cente r for Archeological Research (CAR) in
San Antonio, Texas. In the unlikely event that significant cultural
resources such as human remains are located during clearing activities,
drilling, or any phase of the proposed project, construction should be
halted and USIBWC personnel should work in conjunction with the THC
to determine if any mitigation action is required.
