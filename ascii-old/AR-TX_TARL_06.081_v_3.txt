GEOMORPHOLOGY AND ARCHEOLOGICAL POTENTIAL
AT AQUILLA LAKE

Richard P. Watson

Geomorphological, sedimentological, and soi I genetic evidence
avai Iable through the study of fluvial terraces can be useful in
evaluating the research potential of archeological
sites.
An
established terrace sequence with dated terrace fi I Is and surfaces can
provide evidence for the relative temporal placement of buried
archeological components.
Dated strata within terraces can also be
important chronological indicators. Patton (Chapter 3, this report),
for example, has suggested that the buried soi I horizon in the T2
terrace fi I I, mapped with TO on Figure 3.1, near the confluence of
Hackberry and Aqui I la creeks is probably of late Wisconsin age, about
30,000 B.P. It thereby provides a useful stratigraphic marker below
which archeological remains would not be expected.
The character of the soi Is associated with the various terraces
and the parent material from which they develop, play an important
role in the degree to which different archeological materials wi I I be
preserved.
The depositional environment also plays a large part in
determining what materials wi I I be present in an archeological site.
The fol lowing discussion briefly summarizes the terraces of the
Aqui I la drainage and their potential for
buried
archeological
deposits.
As reviewed in Ch~pter 3, the Aquilla drainage contains three
terraces above the level of the modern floodplain. These terraces can
be correlated, for purposes of dating and description, with those
mapped by Epps (1973) on the Brazcfs River. The three Brazos terraces
are: Tl, which is an average of 30 feet above the adjacent floodplain;
T2, 45-60 feet above the floodplain; and T3, 90-120 feet above the
modern floodplain (Epps 1973:39). In addition, Epps describes a group
of miscellaneous High Gravels
Uvalde Gravels (Byrd 1971) - that
occur at elevations from 200 to 500 feet above the local river level.

41-1

ARCHEDLDGICAL POTENTIAL
Elevations of these terraces near the mouth of Aqui I la Creek, as
shown on topographic maps, place Tl at approximately 28 feet above the
modern floodplain, T2 between 38 and 58 feet above the floodplain, T3
between 120 and 170 feet above the floodplain and the upland surface
and high gravels in excess of 170 feet above the modern stream. These
elevations correspond wel I with those given by Epps. Also, the
numbering of the Aqui I la terraces fol lows that of Epps. At the mouth
of Aqui I la Creek, the Brazos and Aqui I la terraces merge (Fig. 3.1).
The floodplain (TO) of Aqui I la Creek is readily discernible 1n
the lower portions of the drainage, but in the middle and upper
sections it merges with the lower terraces. The lower terraces were
therefore mapped with the floodplain in these parts since they could
not be distinguished on the high altitude photographs avai table.
Included in the TO unit, as mapped in Figure 3.1, is what Stephenson
(1970) describes as the 20 foot terrace which could not be positively
identified in al I cases on the avai table photographs.
The soi Is of the floodplain show no development, or only
incipient development, due to the rapid rate of deposition that is
taking place (Patton, this report). The soi Is associated with this
level in Mclennan County are the Asa, Catalpa, Eufaula, Mi Iler,
Norwood, Pledger, and Trinity series soi Is (Tempi in et al. 1958), and
in Hi I I County they are the Gowen, Pulexas, Pursley, and Tinn series
soi Is (Brooks 1978).
The formation of what 1s essentially the modern floodplain
appears to have occurred near the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
Period. The absence of buried Late Prehistoric materials in the Tl
terrace and their presence in the modern floodplain supports such a
dating. Baker and Penteado-Orel lana's (1977:414) phase 3 episode of
entrenchment for the Colorado River indirectly supports a similar
episode for the Brazos
River.
The
environmental
conditions
responsible for the formation of the modern floodplain, during phase 3
on the Colorado, probably contributed to the decrease in the bison
population as wel I. The exact nature of these changes is uncertain,
although Baker and Penteado-Orel lana (1977:418) have described phases
3 and 2 as a return to drier conditions fol lowing the mesic phase 4.
They estimate that the aggradational phase 4 ended at about 2000 B.P.
The archeological evidence from the Central Brazos argues for a
somewhat later date, perhaps as late as 1400 B.P.
If the Central Brazos Tl terrace can be correlated with the mes1c
phase 4 episode of the Colorado, which is proposed here, then the
archeological evidence seems to indicate that the
entrenchment
fol lowing this phase probably occurred at the end of the Late Archaic
or the beginning of the Late Prehistoric. This may account for the
general lack of archeological sites containing materials transitional
41-2

ARCHEOLOGICAL POTENTIAL
between the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric. These sites are I ikely
to be rare and/or disturbed since occupations adjacent to 1nc1s1ng
streams are more likely to be destroyed by lateral stream erosion.
The lowest deposits in the Kyle Site (Jelks 1962), that show evidence
of mixing, may be representative of the types of sites I ikely to be
found from this crucial period.
Stephenson>s (1970) 20 foot terrace probably correlates with the
Colorado River phases 3 and 2, while the modern floodplain prqbably
represents phase 1. The exact dating of these phases is uncertain.
Archeological evidence from Blum Shelter (Jelks 1953) suggests that a
period of entrenchment corresponding to the Colorado River phase 1
probably began just prior to the Historic Period.
The rapid rate of floodplain deposition in the Aqui I la drainage
contrasts with Epps> (1973:39) interpretation of overbank deposition
on the Brazos, which he characterized as taking place at no more than
two feet per thousand years.
He based this interpretation on
archeological evidence (Epps 1973), although he does not give a
specific reference. This rate does not fit wel I with relatively rapid
deposition on the Brazos at the Steele Site in the Lake Whitney Basin
as reported by Stephenson (1970:217-223, 234-237); the evidence from
the Harrel I Site farther upstream as reported by Krieger (1946);
or
from the McDonald Site on Hackberry Creek as reported here. It is
probably safe to assume that the rate of overbank deposition on the
lower Brazos terraces and floodplain is substantially greater than
that inferred by Epps and is in closer agreement with Patton's
interpretation of deposition rates in the Aqui I la drainage. The rate
of 15 feet in 1500 years proposed by Stephenson (1970:237) may be too
high, in I ight of the uncertain dating of the lowest excavated strata
1n his sites.
Epps (1973:19) has described the Tl terrace on the Brazos as
having relatively undissected scarps and flats with swampy depressions
and incompletely fi I led oxbows discernible on its surface.
These
characteristics are also present on the Aqui I la Tl terrace, although
on a much smaller scale. The soi Is of this terrace show moderate
development and are restricted to the lower portion of the drainage.
Soi Is associated with the Tl terrace in Mclennan County are Asa,
Bastrop, Bel I, Brazos, Brewer, Catalpa, Eufaula, Ivanhoe, Mi Ian,
in
Norwood, Pledger and Vanoss series soi Is (Tempi in et al. 1958);
Hi I I County they are Aqui I la, Branyon, Culp, Eufaula, Kemp and Tinn
series soi Is (Brooks 1978). Only two smal I remnants of this terrace
could be discerned in Hi I I County on the avai Iable aerial photographs.
The Middle and Late Archaic projectile points recovered from this
terrace (Stephenson 1970) suggest that it correlates wel I with the
phase 4 mes1c
episode
of
the
Colorado
River
(Baker
and

41-3

ARCHEOLOGICAL POTENTIAL
Penteado-Orel lana 1977).
If this correlation is correct, the Tl
terrace of the Brazos River would not be expected to contain
archeological materials predating about 3000 B.P. The low frequency
of Middle Archaic sites so far discovered in the Central Brazos may be
related to this sequence of aggradation. Sites dating to the Middle
Archaic would be expected to occur near the middle and base of the Tl
terrace f i I I and are not I ikely to be exposed on the surface, which
may account for their apparent
under
representation
in
the
archeological record of the Central Brazos.
The second terrace, T2, is heavily eroded and is characterized by
mature, wel I developed soi Is, represented in Mclennan County by the
Axtel I, Bel I, Burleson, Irving, Norge, Payne and Sawyer series soi Is
(Tempi in et al. 1958), and in Hi I I County by the Axtel I, Branyon,
Burleson, and Crockett series soi Is (Brooks 1978). The T2 terrace is
discernible farther upstream than the Tl, extending to just above the
confluence of Aqui I la and Al I igator creeks.
Archeological materials
from the T2 terrace f i I I of the Brazos River date to the Early Archaic
and Paleoindian periods (Blaine et al. 1968; Watt and Agogino 1967).
This dating is consistent with the phase 5 episode described by Baker
and Penteado-Orel lana (1977).
The third terrace, T3, occurs on the rol I ing uplands and on
divides between lower order drainages. The f i I I consists of highly
oxidized sediments similar to those of the T2 terrace (Epps 1973:28),
which 1n some areas are cemented by iron oxide, forming massive
ferruginous conglomerates. This terrace contains very wel I developed
soi Is where they have not been removed or truncated by erosion. In
Mclennan County the T3 terrace soi Is are the Axtel I, Bastrop,
Lewisvi I le, Mi la, Norge, Riesel, Sawyer and Travis series soi Is
(Tempi in et al. 1958); in Hi I I County they are the Bastrop, Bastsi I,
Chatt, Gasi I and Venus series soi Is (Brooks 1978). Epps (1973) dates
this terrace to the pre-Kansas Pleistocene.
On the interfluvial areas above Aqui I la Creek, miscellaneous High
Gravels occur as lag deposits.
These lag gravels, identified as
Uvalde gravels by Ritchie and Slaughter (1972), are composed of chert
and quartzite cobbles estimated to be of late Pliocene to early
Pleistocene age (Byrd 1971; Menzer and Slaughter 1971). The surface
of the interfluvial areas probably does not relate specifically to the
development of what is now Aqui I la Creek. It is more I ikely that it
and the associated gravels are the result of larger regional processes
(Byrd 1971).
The dissected scarps of the higher terraces and interf luvial
areas have produced a series of smal I alluvial fans which grade into
the adjacent terraces of the floodplain.
Patton (this report) has
suggested that these alluvial fans probably span the entire period of

41-4

ARCHEOLOGICAL POTENTIAL
the evolution of the Aqui I la Basin. In this case, these fans may
contain
archeological
materials in both primary and secondary
contexts. Schumm (1977) has noted that the erosion and sedimentation
processes of smal I alluvial fans are strongly control led by internal
geomorphic processes related to sediment production within the basin.
It is I ikely, therefore, that these fans have complex depositional
histories and similar stratigraphic sequences cannot be expected.
Fluvial terraces can provide a record of the various factors
affecting the formation of archeological sites. The McDonald Site
provides an interesting and useful case study.
The low energy
floodplain depositional environment of Hackberry Creek was conducive
to the formation of a stratified site with minimal disturbance of
features or artifact associations. The analysis of the sediments at
this site provided information regarding recent changes in the larger
drainage basin, i.e., the clearing and cultivation of sandy soi Is
along Rocky Branch.
As discussed in Chapter 38, the resulting
increased
deposition
of
coarse
grained sediments produced a
distinctive coarse sandy stratum which, with more study, may prove to
be
a
horizon
marker
immediately
overlying Late Prehistoric
archeological materials.
Patton's (this report) discussion of basin expansion on the basis
of sedimentological characteristics during the interval between the
formation of the T2 and T3 terraces provides another example of the
usefulness of terrace evidence in studying environmental history. In
this case, the evidence predates the arrival of man in the New World,
but similar studies of the formation of the Tl terrace would be most
useful since both the floodplain and Tl terrace have
yielded
archeological materials.
The Tinn clay soi Is of the McDonald Site are characteristic of
the young soi Is in the modern floodplain and the lowest terrace of
streams draining the Blackland Prairie.
The calcareous nature of
these soi Is is conducive to the preservation of bone and other fauna I
materials which are often not present in sites in the Central Brazos.
These soi Is, however, have a high shrink-swel I capacity. In certain
topographic situations where they are subject to cycles of thorough
wetting and drying, significant amounts of churning wi I I result in the
mixing of archeological materials. At the McDonald Site these soi Is
do not show their usual degree of churning or self plowing. A
possible explanation is that the proximity of the site to a permanent
stream prevents the deep drying and soi I cracking that results in the
mixing of the horizons.
Other similar sites close to permanent
streams might also be similarly wel I preserved; 41HI104, the Borrowed
Site (Chapter 11), appears to be a further example of this situation.

41-5

ARCHEOLOGICAL POTENTIAL
The floodplains and Tl terraces of Hackberry, Cobb, and Al I igator
creeks, therefore, have probably the highest potential of any part of
the Aqui I la Creek drainage to produce wel I stratified sites with
intact features, excel lent fauna I preservation, and a high potential
for the preservation of phytol iths and other microf loral remains. The
recent depositional history of these streams has served to obscure the
majority of these areas under a sterile mantle of alluvium.
This
deposit of sterile overburden protects these sites from damage, but
necessitates new approaches to the location of archeological sites.
The floodplain and the Tl terrace of Aqui I la Creek
have
significant archeological potential.
However, the preservation of
fauna I remains should be substantially poorer here than on Hackberry
Creek and its tributaries because of the more acidic soi I environment.
Aqui I la Creek has a greater tractive load than occurs in Hackberry
Creek but the depositional environment is sti I I low energy, so that
features and artifact associations should be intact. The Tl terrace
and floodplain of Aqui I la and Little Aqui I la creeks, therefore,
provide an archeological potential simi far to that of Hackberry Creek,
but with poorer preservation of bone and other perishable materials.
As on Hackberry Creek, the potential for stratified deposits is high.
The archeological potential of the T2 terrace is I imited to that
portion of the f i I I lying above the Wisconsin age paleosol. In those
areas that drain the Black land Prairie, the soi Is associated with this
terrace are alkaline clayey soi Is in which sites wi I I probably be
disturbed by modern agricultural practices and pedoturbation.
The
potential for stratified Archaic or Paleoindian sites in this terrace,
such as the Acton Site in Lake Granbury (Blaine et al. 1968), should
not be overlooked, particularly along the Brazos and large tributary
streams. As in the case of the Tl terrace, special techniques of
reconnaissance would probably yield a good return. The preservation
of fauna I remains is I ikely to be highest in those terraces formed
from Black land Prairie source materials. Terrace f i I Is derived from
Eastern Cross Timbers source materials wi I I contain more acidic soils
and there wi I I be poorer preservation of bone and other fauna I
material.
The T3 terrace and interf luvial areas have very I ittle potential
for sites other than surface sites because of their geologic age. The
Pliocene lag gravels in these areas, however, provide a source of
I ithic material known to have been exploited by the prehistoric
inhabitants. It is in these areas that quarry sites are to be
expected.
A fourth area of archeological potential is to be found in the
alluvial fans originating from the surfaces and scarps of the T2 and
T3 terraces and the interf luvial areas.
These features probably
41-6

ARCHEOLOGICAL POTENTIAL
contain archeological materials, but due to the complex nature of the
deposition and erosion that has occurred in the formation of the fans,
special care must be taken to distinguish~ situ from redeposited
material.
This discussion of the archeological potential of certain areas
in the Aqui I la drainage, and in the Central Brazos as a whole, 1s a
first approximation of a predictive model for the definition of site
research
potential.
Some of the critical variables have been
discussed in general terms. A more sophisticated model should be
generated as part of further regional research.

DATA ANALYSIS

David 0. Brown

One of the more interesting features of the Aqui I la Lake Project
has been the attempt to pub I ish the entire series of mitigation
investigations as a single coherent document.
This strategy, which
stems from a genuine agency concern for the information potential of
the archeological resources, minimizes the disjointed effect that can
occur in large multiyear projects, particularly when several different
researchers or institutions are involved.
On the other hand, the
benefits
of increased project scope may be outweighed by the
difficulties faced in assimilating large and diverse data sets.
Thanks to the cooperation of the Corps of Engineers archeologist,
data manipulation difficulties have been considerably reduced by an
attempt to standardize type definitions and laboratory analysis
methods. The task of analyzing such a large data set has been further
simplified by the use of computerized data files and computer aided
statistical manipulations.
Despite these attempts at standardizationJ a number of problems
have arisen with the data that must be addressed so that the qua I ity
of the analyses can be judged fairly by the reader.
This chapter
discusses some of the more obvious problems encountered in the
analysis of the Aqui I la data, and some of the solutions attempted.
Hopefully the recognition of these problems wi I I eliminate a great
deal of potential bias from the final conclusions. Perhaps even more
importantly, it may lead other researchers to consider the possible
subjective biases in their analyses, leading to the creation of
regionally compatible data sets for large scale analysis.
More than 18,000 flakes were recovered from the three seasons of
mitigation
excavations
at Aqui I la Lake.
These specimens were
initially divided into the basic triumvirate of Central Texas flake
type analysis:
primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes (see Chapter
9). As defined here, these are objective categories that should be
rep I icable. Table 42.1 shows the distribution of these flakes by year

of investigation. As can be seen, there are clear differences,
manifested as an apparent increasing of corticate (primary and
secondary) flakes through time. The differences seen in this table
are significant at the p=.0001 level and beyond (Chi-square value=
101.534 with 4 degrees of freedom from SPSS CROSSTABS, Nie et
al. 1975).
Whether this is due to actual differences in the sites
investigated or to analytical subjectivity is difficult to assess.
As noted 1n the chapter discussing laboratory analysis, a
definitional misunderstanding inf lated the number of primary flakes
identified by SMU. According to the 1980 TAS definition, primary
flakes must have 100% cortex on the dorsal surface and a cortex
platform as wel I.
This definition somehow lost the
qualifier
concerning the platform in the SMU work, resulting in a larger number
of primary and smaller number of secondary flakes than would be had by
using the 1980 TAS definition. Table 42.2 shows a comparison between
the counts resulting from the two definitions for the major SMU sites.

addition of the decorticate platform primary flakes approximately
doubles the number of fully corticate primary flakes. Unnoticed, this
difference is significant among the primary flakes and might lead one
to believe that sites in the floodplain were quarry sites with high
primary flake percentages. On the other hand, given the relatively
smal I overal I percentage of primary flakes, the decrease in secondary
flake percentages from this oversight is probably not significant. At
any rate, this error was noted and has been corrected by computer for
the large scale data manipulation in this chapter, but not 1n the
individual SMU text chapters.
An examination of the particular sites contributing to each of
the seasons does not show an easily interpretable pattern. One
potential hypothesis to work from in attempting such an examination is
that sites with nearby I ithic raw material sources would have greater

percentages of corticate (primary and secondary) flakes, and thus
fewer decorticate tertiary flakes. During the 1978 SMU investigations
three sites, the Brazi I Site (41HI75), the McDonald Site (41HI105) and
the Pilgrim Site (41HI124), contributed nearly 95% of al I flakes
(Table 42.3). Two of these, the Brazi I Site and the Pi I grim Site,
with
the
highest
and
lowest percentages of tertiary flakes
respectively, are adjacent to terrace gravels suitable for I ithic
source materials.
The third, the McDonald Site, more than half a
kilometer from source material gravels to the southeast, has a
percentage only slightly lower than the Brazi I Site. In the 1980 TAS
investigations two sites, the Bailey Site (41HI77) and the McDonald
Site, contributed approximately 85% of the flake debitage (Table
42.4). Again, the Bailey Site, surrounded by terrace gravels, has the
42-4

DATA ANALYSIS
highest percentage of tertiary flakes.
Only 1n 1982 does this
hypothetical inverse relationship between source
materials
and
tertiary flakes appear to hold true. Two 1982 TAS sites, the McDonald
Site (41HI105) and 41HI110 1 contributed more than 80% of the flake
debitage and 41HI110, adjacent to a Uvalde gravel source, proved to
have a significantly lower percentage of tertiary flakes (Table 42.5).
The examination of a single site, the McDonald Site, excavated
during al I three seasons, does not serve to clear the issue. As Table
38.6 shows, the differences in percentages are even greater here than
for the combined sites. Subtracting the flakes from the fine screened
SMU units, which have a considerably higher percentage of smal I
tertiary
flakes,
sti I I
leaves
1078 tertiary flakes (51.9%),
considerably larger than the two TAS figures. Analysis of the site in
terms of gross areas does not help much. Essentially al I of the 1980
TAS flake collection from 41HI105 came from Area A, and, conversely,
al I of the 1982 TAS flakes came from Area B. Assuming potential
activity area differences between these two, it is easy to concede the
1.4% difference between the two in tertiary flakes. Unfortunately
SMU, whose collection came from both areas, does not fal I between the
two.
In fact, although the greatest portion of the SMU collection
came from Area A, their percentage of tertiary flakes is farthest from
that figure.
The point of this discussion 1s not an indictment of any
particular analyst or set of data, but only the suggestion that flake
analysis criteria, no matter how objectively specified, are subject to
analytical biases.
It 1s not possible, unfortunately, to state
unequivocally whether or not the separation off lakes into corticate
stages has been strongly biased, or whether the differences reflect
real prehistoric activity differences. Given the objective criteria
established
here for their definition, and the fact that the
differences are not nearly so great as in other categories discussed
in this chapter, these flake class data wi I I be accepted as val id.
The next class of flake data to be considered here is platform
type.
This supposedly objective criterion was determined to be less
than perfectly objective under careful scrutiny in the lab.
Two
problems were noted.
On many smaller platforms, facets were only
visible under magnification and on platforms of al I sizes, but
particularly on the smaller ones, it was not always a simple matter to
separate faceting, or platform preparation, from natural, wrinkle-I ike
flaws in the chert.
Tables 42.6 and 42.7 show the percentages of
various platform types identified for secondary and tertiary flakes.
As can be seen, the percentages of cortex platforms among the
secondary flakes are generally close, ranging from 27.0% in 1980 to
33.2% in 1982. The most serious divergence appears in the percentages
of single and multiple facet platforms. The variation among secondary

flakes alone, from 24.3% to 58.4% for single facet and from as I ittle
as 3.8% to 45.6% for multiple facet platforms, is greater than would
be expected by differences among the sites. The variation in tertiary
flakes is even greater, from 22.5% to 73.8% for single facet and from
Perhaps even more

DATA ANALYSIS
conv1nc1ng than these summary tables are the individual site totals
for each of the seasons of analysis, shown in tables 42.8, 42.9 and
42.10. As these show, there is no overlap in the range of percentages
for single and multiple facet platform categories between the years,
with the exception of two sites having aÂ· total of 27 flakes between
them.
The SMU percentages range from 61.8% to 71.4% for single
facets. The 1980 TAS single facet percentages range from 13.4% to
25.9% for sites with a sample size greater than 100 flakes. The 1982
TAS single facet platform percentages range between 37.9% and 42.1%
for similar sample sizes. There is a similar lack of overlap for the
multiple facet flakes, where SMU figures range between 4.9% and 10.7%
and TAS 1980 figures (for larger sites) range between 49.6% and 70.7%,
and between 4.9% and 10.7% for 1982.

The percentages of crushed platforms exhibit similar divergences.
The overal I average of the 1978 SMU and 1982 TAS materials is quite
similar with a smal I overlap, but the 1980 TAS percentage of crushed
platforms is significantly lower.

These differences are great enough to question the validity of
any analysis uti I izing these figures. Using the analysis of materials
from the McDonald Site as an example once more, it can be seen that
there is very I ittle similarity in these figures, ranging from 21.3%
single facet flakes in 1980 to 66.6% in 1978, and from 10.7% multiple
facet platform flakes in 1978 to 62.8% in 1980. Certain expected
relationships seem to hold true among the data, however.
Using a
similar logic to that expressed above, sites farthest from I ithic
source materials might be expected to have a lower frequency of basic
tool manufacture and a higher frequency of finishing and resharpening.
These latter activities should yield higher percentages of multiple
facet platforms. The McDonald Site, which fits the above criteria, is
generally among the higher percentages of multiple facet platforms.
This is true of the 1978 material where the McDonald Site has the
highest percentage, fol lowed closely by the Brazi I Site (41HI75) and
the Reps Davis Site (41HI58), both located on the floodplain but
adjacent to terrace gravel I ithic sources. In 1982, the McDonald Site
is tied with 41HI110, which has a smal I component at the edge of the
floodplain, for the highest percentage of multiple facet platform
flakes.
The situation is more complex in 1980 when two other sites
42-9

DATA ANALYSIS
have higher percentages of multiple facet platforms than the McDonald
Site.
One of these sites, 41HI74/114, is located on a sandy terrace
remnant with few, if any, gravels present on the surface. The lowest
percentage of multiple platform flakes is found at the Bailey Site
(41HI77), where terrace gravels are I iteral ly everywhere.

While the identification

various
platform
types
ts
theoretically objective, the recognition of ventral platform I ips is
subject to personal bias.
This is relatively obvious in
the
distribution of I ipped flakes from the Aqui I la Lake Project.

42.11 shows the distribution of I ipped flakes between the three
seasons of excavation.
Again, there are marked differences between
the seasons, with the 1978 data showing an extremely low percentage of
I ipped flakes.
Individual differences can be seen even more clearly
in the data from the various sites (tables 42.12, 42.13 and 42.14).
Many of the 1982 flakes were analyzed by the same person who conducted
42-12

DATA ANALYSIS
the 1980 analysis. Two sites, however, were analyzed by a different
lab assistant. These two sites, 41HI109 and 41HI110, have the highest
ventral platform lip percentages of any sites in the lake area.
The identification of thermally altered flakes shows
some
differences, primarily between the 1978 SMU data and both TAS seasons
(Table 42.15). Although the individual sites are not shown here,
there is some overlap between al I three seasons and it is not clear if
the differences are due to prehistoric activities or analytical bias.
Established on the basis of crazing and pot I idding only, this
category, I ike that of flake classifications, should be relatively
objective.
The last flake category, material type, should also theoretically
be objective, but, as mentioned previously, there may have been some
difficulties in distinguishing between coarse grained cherts and fine
grained quartzites. Looking at Table 42.16, it is clear that the only
category other than chert large enough to cause a problem is
quartzite.
While the percentages of quartzite are identical for 1978
and 1980, there is a considerably higher percentage found in 1982.
A
large part of this is due to the fact that much of the 1982 debitage
came from 41HI109 and 41HI110 (44.7% of the 1982 flake sample), two
sites where the percentage of quartzite is apparently higher, either
because of prehistoric activities or the nature of local source
materials.
Even taking this into account, the 1982 percentages of
quartzite are significantly higher.
As if the problems with data coding were not enough, very few of
the
sites
can
be said to represent a single component, so
interpretation of any analysis of materials becomes overwhelmingly
complex. The McKenzie Site is the closest to a single component site,
occupied for a brief period during the Late Archaic or early Late
Prehistoric.
Unfortunately, it has yielded only eleven flakes and no
diagnostic artifacts. After this the Reps Davis Site, or at least the
floodplain midden portion of it investigated in 1978, may be the
second closest example. However, both the radiocarbon dates and the
diagnostic artifacts suggest that this is not a single component site.
In any case, its sample size of 125 flakes is perhaps somewhat low to
base any substantial conclusions upon.
Most of the other sites are definitely multicomponent, with
evidence of occupations extending over a long period of time. This is
especially true of surface collections at 41HI109 and 41HI110, where
projectile points from almost every period are represented. The
Bailey (41HI77) and Sul I ivan (41HI117) sites also show evidence of use
over a long period of time.

While some of the sites from the Aqui I la Lake area show evidence
of use throughout most of the Prehistoric Period (e.g., 41HI109,
41HI110), many can be placed in a more restricted temporal framework,
even though in some cases this may be the result of smal I sample size.
The Pilgrim Site (41HI124), for example, seems to contain primarily
diagnostics from the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. Most
of the materials from the McDonald Site (41HI105) come from the Late
Prehistoric levels, with some Late Archaic materials from the 1982
season. The materials from the Reps Davis Site (41HI58) probably
represent this same time period. The Brazi I Site (41HI175) and the
Sul Ii van Site (41HI117) have yielded a number of diagnostic artifacts
from the Early and Middle Archaic periods. Site 41HI74/114, on the
other hand, has been described by Watson (1982) as dating to the
Middle and Late Archaic.
Table 42.17 shows the flake type assemblages by site for al I
three seasons of investigations.
Corticate/decorticate ratios are
also shown for each site. Examination of this table shows that both
of the documented early sites (41HI117 and 41HI75) have ratios wel I
below 1:1, while the Late Archaic - Late Prehistoric sites (41HI105,

DATA ANALYSIS
One factor that would strongly influence the corticate percentage
is the size of the raw material uti I ized. Smaller source materials
would produce greater percentages of secondary
flakes.
Since
inspection of the Uvalde gravel outcrops throughout the Aqui I la Lake
area suggested I ittle difference in size ranges, another factor must
be responsible. It is hypothesized here that the earlier inhabitants
of the area, with their choice of chert resources, chose the largest
cobbles.
Resource depletion through time left only the smaller chert
gravels for the Late Archaic
and
Late
Prehistoric
peoples.
Examination of the actual Uvalde gravels showed very little chert
present.
This paucity may be an expression of chert resource
depletion through time.
The depletion hypothesis is not supported by the material type
variable coded for the Aqui I la Lake Project debitage. Table 42.18
shows the material types recorded at each of the major sites discussed
in this report.
Here the higher percentages of chert occur at
floodplain sites (41HI105, 41HI58) and other sites distant from chert
sources (41HI125), while the lowest percentages occur at sites very
While these figures
near large sources (41HI109, 41HI110, 41HI77).
may indicate depletion of individual sources through time, they seem
to relate wel I to simple avai labi I ity of material and distance from
chert source. Sites with less than about 96~ chert are, for the most
part, close to sources, while sites with more than this percentage are
at some distance.
From this datum one might assume that quartzite,
which is abundantly avai fable in al I of the source material areas, was
not a particularly desirable resource but was useful for certain tasks
if close at hand.
Another approach to the understanding of this problem is to
compare
chert
percentages
to
other
technological variables.
Comparison with corticate percentages from the various sites shows no
correlation with either distance to source materials or period of
occupation, which has previously been suggested as a potential
explanation for corticate percentage change in the resource depletion
hypothesis. Comparison of chert percentages with platform types
yields a sf ightly more intel I igible correlation. Although direct
comparisons of platform types are made difficult by the analytical
biases discussed above, it is possible to combine and sort the data to
achieve useful ordinal categories. Since single facet and multiple
facet platforms can convincingly be I inked to different manufacturing
stages, or even different technologies, a ratio between these two
variables was calculated and subsequently ranked as low, medium or
high for each year. The internal validity of these ranked groups is
supported by examination of the separate season ratios for 41HI105 and
Comparison of
41HI110, al I of which fal I in the intermediate group.
these three groups to chert percentages ranked high and low (Figure
42.1) shows some interesting combinations that go a step beyond simple

correlation with distance to chert source.
42-18

DATA ANALYSIS

Al I three of the floodplain sites (41HI104, 41Hl105 and 41HI58)
are found in the high chert, low and intermediate single facet
platform categories in the lower left and center of the figure
(Fig. 42.1), a grouping interpreted as indicating distance from chert
materials. In the upper right hand corner of the figure, with low
chert and high single facet platforms, are two sites located almost
exclusively on upland areas that abut the floodplain of the creek,
41HI109 and 41HI77. In the upper center of the figure, the low chert,
intermediate single facet platform category, are sites that occur on
older terraces and extend into upland or higher terrace areas, 41HI75,
41HI117 and 41HI110. Note that in the latter case, while there are
some similarities to 41HI109, the collection from 41HI109 comes almost
exclusively from the upland area and the collection from 41HI110 comes
substantially from the old terrace and floodplain segment, which
itself may also be a low old terrace rather than modern floodplain.
In the upper left corner, with low chert and low single facet
platforms, are two old terrace remnant sites, extending down onto, and
for
the
most
part
surrounded
by,
the
modern floodplain.
Interestingly, the final category here, with high chert and high
single facet platforms, includes two sites that are on high terrace
remnants .near the creek, 41HI124 and 41HI125. In fact, both sites lie
along the Aqui I la Creek edge of the old terrace above the confluence
of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks. Both have varying amounts of creek
terrace gravels exposed nearby, but both are at some distance from
Uvalde gravel outcrops and from upland areas.

DATA ANALYSIS

constantly renewed creek bed gravels and where a range of lithic
reduction activities was conducted, with particular emphasis on final
stage manufacture and maintenance. Conversely, sites with lower chert
percentages and intermediate to high single facet platform ratios are
generally located on or immediately adjacent to source gravels. The
apparent exception to this generalization is the Sul I ivan Site
(41HI117) for which there is no clear aboriginal gravel source.
Gravels were found underlying the upper terrace area, however, and
analysis of the materials shows a considerable amount of larger
debitage such as might be present near a source area.
In addition,
the percentages of various artifact types (Table 42.19) seem to be
more in I ine with those from sites near source areas. It is suggested
here that at some time during the Early and perhaps Middle Archaic,
high terrace gravels were exposed in erosional gul I ies at the site.
These were subsequently covered over by depositional episodes during
the late Middle and Late Archaic. Al I of these sites are interpreted
as near source gravels where a wide range of I ithic reduction
activities took place but with emphasis on initial stages
of
reduction, particularly at 41HI77 and 41HI109.
The separation of the terrace remnant sites into low chert/low
single facet and high chert/high single facet groups is interesting.
Both 41HI74/114 and 41HI125 are on intermediate old terraces with few
source gravels present, while 41HI76 and 41HI124 are on higher
terraces with modern exposures of gravels. What may separate these
sites is their distance from the creek. Both of the high chert/high
single facet sites are on old terraces near the modern creek bed where
lateral movement by the channel may have continually renewed exposures
of basal terrace gravels through time. The low chert/low single facet
sites are on terrace remnants at some distance from the creek. In
contrast to the rationale at other sites for chert-quartzite ratios,
the situation seems reversed at these sites. In these cases, the
lowered chert percentages may reflect depletion of the I imited sample
of exposed terrace gravels and the lack of renewed exposures by creek
erosion.
Although a simple analysis of the debitage from these sites can
be used to characterize both differences and similarities among them,
it is necessary to include other materials collected, especially
tools.
Again, as with the debitage, it is felt that there is some
potential analytical bias present in the different seasons
of
laboratory classification, particularly with regard to the distinction
between bifacial cores and crude bifaces.
As much as possible,
potential seasonal differences have been isolated and discussed but
there is I ittle hope for their elimination without a ful I re-analysis
of the materials.

Table 42.19 shows the percentage totals of gross artifact
categories present at the sites with larger artifact samples. As can
be seen there 1s considerable variation, particularly among the
debitage categories. Standing out among these is the Reps Davis Site
(41HI58), which has the highest percentages of flakes and cores and
the lowest percentage of chips of any of the sites studied. The
sample size is also the smallest of any of these sites, a factor that
may play a role here. Only 41HI110 1 a site with seemingly I ittle in
common either culturally or geomorphical ly with Reps Davis, approaches
the debitage percentages for this site, with the exception of cores
which are nowhere as high.
Comparison of Table 42.19 with Table 32.5 which shows the same
categorical percentages for each of the seasons of excavation at the
McDonald Site (41HI105), suggests some potential analytical bias in
the identification of flakes versus chips. Comparing the figures from
both tables, during the 1982 season flakes outnumber chips in every

case,

compr1s1ng

about half of the total collection or more. During
debris in every
case and in 1978, the sites other than Reps Davis are evenly split
between chip-heavy and flake-heavy sites. The fact that these trends
from al I of the sites are confirmed by the figures from three separate
seasons of excavation at the same site suggests that the biases
observed are real.
These analytical biases are marked enough to
obscure any cultural trends that might otherwise be perceived in the
data.
1980, chips comprise half or more of al I the I ithic

The analysis of the Aqui I la data has brought to I ight several
interesting points concerning subjectivity in data analysis. One of
these is that the potential for subjective variabi I ity increases
greatly when more than one analyst is used, or even the same analyst
during two different periods of time. Large quantities of data do not
erase such problems, nor does the use of a computer. One could
calculate a correction factor for each analyst or season of analysis
but it would be almost impossible to assess to what degree there might
also be real cultural differences as wel I. Another point is that even
the most objective categories may not be so certain. The discussion
in this chapter has gone so far as to question the relatively wel I
established objective criteria of primary, secondary and tertiary
flakes and has found it difficult to effectively uti I ize
the
supposedly objective criteria of platform categories.
Several specific suggestions are offered for particular variables
used here.
First and foremost, analytical categories should be
defined precisely and definitions should follow, as much as possible,
current local usage. Second, a single analyst should be utilized if
possible. If multiple and/or inexperienced analysts are necessary,
some comparative samples consisting of known quantities should be run
to objectively assess the potential I imits of analytical bias. Third,
criteria should be as objective as possible.
Related to this last suggestion is the proposal that not al I
materials need be analyzed, and that al I materials analyzed need not
be analyzed to the same degree. It would be ideal if the archeologist
could create a giant computer bank of objective metric data from the
materials and make it avai I able to al I other researchers
for
comparative studies.
Even if such compilations were possible under
typically existing budgets, the demon of subjectivity would be lurking
behind every bit of information. The strategy advocated here is to
abandon or greatly simplify the analysis of data from mixed or
surf icial components, for example, in favor of a detailed and
objective analysis of components judged to be more intact.

42-25

DATA ANALYSIS
This does not imply the destruction of some data to implement the
recovery of other data, as in some specific excavation research
designs. The data remains in the collection. Only that data with the
greatest potential for yielding significant cultural information 1s
initially recorded, al lowing the recording of a greater amount of
information with I ittle long term loss. Relevant to this point is
that, above and beyond a certain minimum acceptable level, analytical
variables should not be recorded blindly to simply increase the total
number of variables, but should be recorded with the solution of a
particular problem in mind. Such problem oriented artifact analysis
appears necessary for yielding the maximum information potential from
large collections.

CHAPTER 43
AQUILLA LAKE FOOD RESOURCE EXPLOITATION:
CATCHMENT ANALYSIS EVALUATION

David 0. Brown

INTRODUCTION
As with most archeological projects undertaken in Central Texas,
the great majority of the materials recovered from the Aqui I la Lake
area are I ithic artifacts.
While analysis of the sty I istic and
functional variabi I ity of I ithic materials provides an essential base
for the understanding of aboriginal I ifeways, there are noticeable
I imitations in the attempt to extrapolate from I ithic material culture
to other cultural subsystems. One area where these I imitations leave
unfortunately large lacunae is in interpretation of the prehistoric
group's exploitation of their environment. Although it is possible to
make some ecological inferences from tool forms, such as the use of
projectile points in hunting; for the most part these interpretations
cannot substitute for primary data, such as faunal or floral remains
from archeological sites.
One approach to
environmental
resource
uti I ization,
not
necessarily I imited by the fortuitous preservation of fauna I or floral
materials, is the catchment analysis.
This technique, originally
devised by Higgs et al. (1967) for Paleo I ithic sites in Epirus, Greece
and later expanded upon by Vita-Finzi and Higgs (1970) in a study of
Upper
Paleo I ithic
and
Neolithic sites in Palestine, involves
description of the resources available within a stated distance from a
site.
Site catchment analysis has been used with some success in
other parts of the world with both hunter gatherer and agricultural
vi I Iage sites (Zarky 1976, Flannery 1976, Peebles 1978, Webley 1972,
Davidson 1976). Roper (1979) discusses some of the better known
applications of the technique and its I imitations.
In their report on the 1976 testing at Aqui I la Lake (Skinner et
al. 1978), a preliminary catchment analysis is attempted for the area.
This analysis, centered upon the Brazi I Site, described the fauna I and
floral resource potential for the Cross Timbers and Blackland Prairie

43-1

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
biotic zones. A detailed I ist was compiled of potentially exploited
floral and fauna! species and some quantitative approaches to yield
values suggested. Fauna! resource potential was explored in greater
detai I, taking into account animal population densities, maximum
harvest rates and kilograms of usable meat and
calories
per
individual.
This potential was compared with the estimated caloric
requirements necessary for the survival of a range of group sizes that
might possibly inhabit the area.
The fol lowing section reiterates some of the maJor points of
catchment analyses in general and summarizes some of the findings of
the 1978 SMU analysis, adding some new figures to the floral
resources.
The catchment analysis is then taken as a model and
compared with the actual fauna! material recovered from the area.
Some minor adjustments are made to create a new model that can be
tested against new data from further excavations in the region.
Several problems are noted in the technique. A key difficulty is
the determination of the distance outward from the site and the manner
Based on Lee>s (1979)
in which such distance should be recorded.
observation of foraging distances from camp by the !Kung Bushmen, six
miles (10 km) has become a commonly accepted figure for hunter
gatherer catchment analyses.
Vita-Finzi and Higgs (1970), however,
measured their circle in actual walking times, accounting
for
potential differences in terrain. An entirely different approach was
used by Flannery (1976), who attempted to establish the potential size
of the procurement area of various materials based on their nearest
probable source. The SMU catchment analysis, examined in more detai I
below, used the simplest approach, a circle with a ten kilometer
radius drawn around the Brazi I Site (41HI76). Some further discussion
of the choice of this figure is included below.
Another source of error in catchment analyses 1s 1n
the
extrapolation backwards in time from currently avai Iable resources to
aboriginal ones. This is often partially mitigated by the use of
resource criteria that may have changed very I ittle in the long run
such as soi Is or geology. The use of fauna I or floral zones, even
generalized ones, can be problematic in many areas, such as parts of
Texas where a long history of Euroamerican agriculture and the
destruction and recent invasion of species has severely altered
natural biotic zones. In areas such as Aqui I la Lake, where biotic
zones are primarily determined by geology, the problems are somewhat
simplified but there are sti I I questions as to the aboriginal
vegetation of the Cross Timbers and Black land Prairie, as wel I as the
nature and extent of the ecotonal region between the two.

43-2

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
Another potential analytical problem I ies in the difficulty of
determining which catchment area resources were used and which were
not and which, if any, of the avai I able resources might have been
critical
in
determining
site location.
Due to the lack of
preservation at the Brazi I Site, determining which resources were
actually
uti I ized
is an impossibi I ity.
Fortunately, a fauna I
collection is avai I able from at least one site in the reservoir area,
the McDonald Site.
Although the resources in the immediate area of
the McDonald and Brazi I sites might be different, the larger ten
kilometer catchment ring for both is similar. The larger McDonald
Site catchment area includes slightly more Black land Prairie and
slightly less Cross Timbers but the differences are probably less than
the error of estimating aboriginal resource zones from
modern
topographic maps. For this reason, the figures derived from the 1978
SMU catchment analysis wi I I be used as is for a first approximation.
FLORAL RESOURCES
The SMU analysis presents the potentially avai I able aboriginal
floral resources in some detai I although it does not calculate
subsistence figures in the model. SMU's analysis wi I I be summarized
briefly here. See also the discussion of vegetation in Chapter 2.
Skinner et al. (1978:150-1) divide the Black land Prairie into
three subzones. The principal climax dominant of their upland zone is
I ittle bluestem grass, with subdominants including Indian grass, big
bluestem, needlegrass and prairie dropseed. Areas along drainages are
divided into a drier grassy lowland zone with big bluestem grass as
the dominant and Indian grass and switchgrass as subdominants. The
wetter bottomland association includes an overstory of red ash, cedar
elm and hackberry with an understory of woody vines such as grapes,
poison ivy and greenbriar, and shrubs such as rough-leaf dogwood,
downy and green haws, big-tree, hog plums, Eve's necklace, black haw
and coralberry. Occasional overstory species include red oak, pecan,
post oak, red mulberry and I ive oak.
the
original
Although there is some discussion regarding
vegetation of the Cross Timbers region, it seems I ikely that various
species of oak would have been more important in the upland areas of
the Cross Timbers than in the Black land Prairie. Skinner et al.
(1978) apparently favor an upland savannah with stands of post oak,
blackjack oak with some black hickory, southern red oak and white oak.
The understory, in addition to greenbriar,
probably
consisted
primarily of I ittle bluestem, big bluestem, Indian grass, tal I
dropseed, sideoats grama and hairy grama. They also suggest that the
Cross Timbers bottomland was very much I ike that of the Blackland
Prairie.

As Skinner et al. (1978) point out, grasses were the predominant
vegetation over much of the upland area of the Aqui I la Lake region.
Some of the quaternary terrace surfaces as wel I as some of the
bottomland areas may have been predominantly grassy.
They also
suggest that the smal I size of the seeds of these grasses would not
have made them very desirable as aboriginal food resources. In any
case, many grass species are widely spread throughout the area, being
avai I able 1n several biotic zones or subzones. Ubiquitous to the

43-4

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
project area are I ittle and big bluestem grasses; accounting for as
much as 70~ of the cover in some areas (Skinner et al. 1978). With
the exception of needle grass, which produces seed in the spring, al I
of the grasses produce seed in the summer (generally late summer) and
fal I. Figure 43.1 i I lustrates the seasonality of major grass species
at Aqui I la Lake.
Aboriginal vegetal resources would have been found 1n the
bottomland areas as wel I as in stands of oaks in the upland areas of
the Cross Timbers. The seasonality of the major non-grass vegetal
species is shown in Figure 43.2, adapted from Skinner et al.
(1978:Table 14). Note that no maJor species are I isted for the
Blackland Prairie uplands. This figure shows the productivity of the
bottomlands of both biotic zones and their similarity;
the Cross
Timbers is different only in the addition of various oak species. The
greatest potential resource production period for each of the areas is
fal I, although both bottomland zones have a secondary fruiting season
in the spring, and available plant foods in the summer as wel I,
particularly late summer.
Limited largely to oak, the upland Cross
Timbers is a major food resource production area probably used almost
exclusively during the fal I.
Table 43.1 I ists the more common edible plants found in the
Aqui I la Lake area, g1v1ng their common and scientific names. The
species occurrences are taken from Flook (1972) and Slack and Marcy
(1983), while edibi I ity is from Skinner et al. (1978), Winkler
(1982), McCormick (1973) and Keller (1974). This I ist by no means
exhausts the possible edible plants available, many of which have been
documented as uti I ized by historic Indian groups as wel I as early
settlers.
Nonetheless, the lack of botanical remains from the area
hinders any attempt at further investigation.
In an attempt to rectify this lack, a pollen study was conducted
on samples collected from the McDonald Site by the author and Cl int
Davis under the direction of Dr. Richard Jones of The University of
Texas at Austin. The study used the method reported by Woosley (Raab
and Woosley 1982) for her work at the Cobb-Poole Site located on the
pra1r1e near Dal las. Unfortunately, her success was not replicated.
While a few pollen grains were recovered from the surface stratum, the
lower soi I zones yielded almost no identifiable pollen.
Elaboration of the Floral Model
The original SMU catchment model attempted a quantification of
the avai I able fauna I resources of the Aqui I la Lake area, however, no
such model was created for the floral resources. While any attempt to
recreate the paleof lora of a disturbed ecosystem is fraught with

difficulties, quantitative estimates of the modern vegetal communities
were unavai I able for the area at the time of the the original model
(Skinner et al. 1978:152), making the task a near impossibi I ity.
A
recent study by Texas A & M University (Slack and Marcy 1983) provided
valuable data on the density of modern floral resources in the area
which has been used in this section to derive rough production figures
potentially valuable to the aboriginal inhabitants.
Areal figures used for this re-analysis are those provided by SMU
for the 10 kilometer catchment radius around the Brazi I. Site,
considered to be an example of a Late Archaic base camp (Skinner et
al. 1978:150).
These figures include 154.5 square kilometers of
upland and 3.9 square kilometers of bottom land within the Black land
Prairie, 135.6 square kilometers of upland and 16.4 kilometers of
bottomland within the Cross Timbers and 3.6 square kilometers of
remnant terraces that do not fit either biotic zone. Although the
potential food value of grasses might have been great, the fol lowing
estimates are confined primarily to hardwood nuts and fruits which are
thought to have contributed a significant portion of the vegetal
resources.
Although differential preservation of floral remains
introduces considerable bias into quantitative analysis, hardwood nuts
are the primary vegetal remains at many East Texas Caddo sites (Keller
1974:142; Jackson 1981; Perttula and Bruseth 1983:18-19).
For the present study, only two major biomes are considered 1n
estimating resource potential.
These are the riparian floodplain
forests I ining the creeks and major lateral tributaries, and the oak
savannah of the Cross Timbers uplands. The bottomland area of both
the Blackland Prairie and Cross Timbers is assumed to be part
grassland and part riparian forest. While the actual percentages of
forest would have fluctuated through time, with perhaps greater areas
of grassland occurring during both very wet and very dry climates, a
figure of 50% riparian forest is assumed here. Although the figures
are not precisely comparable, the Slack and Marcy (1983) study
recorded 687.3 acres of riparian forest in the 10,213.1 acre project
area which corresponds closely to the actual lake area. This yields
6.7% riparian forest. In their broad study area of 43,156 acres,
which corresponds more closely to the range of habitats found in the
catchment ci~cle, only 973.4 acres of riparian forest were recorded,
yielding a percentage of 2.3% riparian forest. Adding to this figure
the 367.7 acres of developed riparian land yields an overal I figure of
3.1% potential riparian forest which is almost identical to the 3.2%
figure from estimation of 50% of the catchment area bottomland as
forested.

43-8

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
The upland area is a more difficult problem.
Slack and Marcy
describe 2541.9 acres as forest, although this includes some parkland
and savannah. This comprises 24.9% of the total project area during
the original 1979 survey (some forested areas had been cleared by the
1982 vegetation survey). Only 1592.2 acres are actually described as
woodland forest during 1979, amounting to about 15.6% of the total.
Contrasted to this is the upland Cross Timbers area of the SMU
catchment ring which comprises 43.2% of the total.
Despite the losses to cropland, it is I ikely, given modern fire
control considerations, that the Cross Timbers oak forest covered a
much smaller area in prehistoric times. Thus the amount of estimated
forested acres wi I I be reduced accordingly. Additionally, since the
original Cross Timbers forest may have been primarily a savannah
rather than a woodland, some further adjustments must be made. A scan
of Slack and Marcy>s less disturbed primary habitat types - Cedar elm
Woodland, Oak Woodland, Pecan Woodland, Mesquite/cedar elm Parkland,
Mesquite Woodland, Mesquite Savannah and Riparian Woodland
shows
only one, Oak Woodland, which seems to approximate descriptions of the
original. For the sake of simplicity, the Oak Woodland habitat has
been chosen to represent the original forest, estimated at comprising
10% of the total upland Cross Timbers area. Admittedly, such a figure
may grossly under estimate the extent of the upland forest during
moist climatic periods, but it provides a starting point for further
analysis.
The remainder of the upland and terrace areas are assumed
to be grasslands and are not considered further.
Production figures used here are those reported 1n Keller (1974)
for similar species in East Texas, with some adjustments. Because of
the drier climate at Aqui I la Lake, these figures may over estimate the
available resources, but should be offset by the low estimate of total
upland forested area.
Keller (1974:146-7) gives figures for the
average annual weight of fruit produced by many common species and the
caloric value per pound of the fruit.
The fol lowing figures, in
tables 43.2 and 43.3, extrapolate those production figures into the
Aqui I la Lake area.
The total estimated production from these
two
areas
1s
10,909,800,000 kilocalories, a figure enormously greater than the
137,051,207 ki localories estimated for animal resource potential for
the catchment area.
The bulk is acorn production from the Cross
Timbers upland, where the estimate of the percentage of forested area
was set quite low. The implications of this figure wi I I be discussed
in the concluding section of this chapter.

FAUNAL RESOURCES
Skinner et al. (1978) have discussed the Aqui I la Lake fauna in
some detail, estimating animal population densities, potential harvest
rates, meat yields and caloric values for several important game
species.
These species include deer, raccoon, opossum, turkey,

Deer provide one of the major sources of animal protein as
projected for the aboriginal population, comprising almost 90% of meat
consumed by weight. Since there are no data on the prehistoric
carrying capacity for deer in the Cross Timbers and Blackland Prairie
area, and the natural population has become al I but extinct, these
figures for deer, which are extrapolated from the ecologically quite
different Edwards Plateau area, may be too high. On the ~ther hand,
it is probably realistic to expect deer to form the greatest single
component of the faunal assemblage. The SMU calculations for deer and
the other six animal species are shown in the order of their
contribution to the aboriginal diet in Table 43.4.

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION

Note that after deer, whose avai Iable meat weight per individual
1s more than ten times that of any other animal on the I ist, the fox
squirrel, with the smallest available meat weight, is I isted as
providing the greatest caloric addition to the diet. Raccoon and
opossum each provide more than half of the caloric total of the fox
squirrel, while both lagomorph species each provide only about half of
this total. Wi Id turkey, with a meat weight equal to or larger than
any of the smaller mammals, provides only a minor fraction of the
total calories. The minor species I isted in the paragraph above are
not individually quantified but are collectively estimated to provide
an additional 34,005,187 ki localories, or one-third of the 103,046,020
ki localories
estimated
for the major games species.
Dividing
34,005,187 by the 28 potential minor game resources (excluding nutria)
yields
a
figure
of
1,214,471 ki localories per resource, or
approximately the same contribution to the faunal diet as the
jackrabbit.
Of course, al I of these minor species were not I ikely to
have been exploited with the same di I igence, and many animals not
included on the I ist may have comprised a significant minor portion of
the diet. Fish and shel If ish, for example, may have played an
important dietary role at some riverine sites.
In the derivation of a model describing the potentially exploited
food resources of the aboriginal inhabitants in the Aqui I la Lake area,
it would be possible to work from the point of view of the biotic
potential of the study area, as Smith (1975) has done for Late
Prehistoric populations in the upper part of the Lower Mississippi
Valley, or from the point of view of human subsistence requirements,
as attempted by Reidhead (1979) for Late Woodland populations in
II I inois.
Although the parameters of a subsistence model, given the
current knowledge of human nutritional needs, are probably much more
recoverable than prehistoric faunal densities, the complexities of
such a model may outweigh its uti I ity. As Jochim (1983) has pointed
out with respect to Reidhead's study, the actual data show a stronger
correlation with biomass estimates than with the Reidhead model.
SMU 1 s biotic potential model (Skinner et al. ms.) is similar in
many respects to that derived by Smith (1975), substituting locally
avai Iable animal population figures where available.
Unfortunately,
the study suffers from the lack of figures for the Cross Timbers and
Black land Prairie biotic zones. Even were such figures avai Iable, the
extent of historic land modification in these areas would make them
automatically suspect when extrapolated backwards to the prehistoric
situation.
The difficulties in accurate paleofauna reconstruction
render the parameters of any model questionable.
The parameters of
the SMU model are therefore as good as any to serve as a first
approximation of the aboriginal resource exploitation of the area. In
the fol lowing section, the actual fauna I data from the McDonald Site
is compared wi.th_ the SMU biotic potential model.
43-13

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION

McDonald Site Fauna
A brief reiteration of the environment of the McDonald Site and a
comparison to the Brazi I Site, for which the SMU model was derived,
may be useful. For a more detailed discussion, see the individual
chapters describing those sites and Chapter 2 on the environment of
the Aqui tla Lake area.
The McDonald Site is on the floodplain adjacent to the modern
channel
of
Hackberry Creek.
Creekward-sloping cultural strata
observed in BHT F cut laterally into the creek bank indicate that the
modern channel was active at least during the Late Prehistoric
occupation. The riparian woodland surrounding the site, potentially a
virgin stand, exhibited a remarkable species diversity with a moderate
to low density of lower story species, i.e., relatively clear of
undergrowth.
Although no stumps were evident, it is possible that
some hardwoods were logged out of the bottoms during the nineteenth or
early twentieth century.
A few hundred meters to the east of the site, an oak forest
covers the valley slopes and the deeply incised drainages that cut
back into them. Because of the unsuitabi I ity of these slopes for
agriculture, it is also uni ikely that this area has been cleared in
the past. Between the riparian woodland and the oak forest is a strip
of grassland which extends to the creek south of the site. Much or
al I of this area may have been cleared for agriculture, but, if partly
natural (i.e., SMU's grassy lowland zone described above), would
create a relatively large amount of edge forest, making the area
attractive to deer and other species that exploit diverse resources.
Above the oak I ined hi I Isides are rol I ing hi I Is that are now
almost exclusively cleared and cultivated. Although patches of the
hi I Iside forest would have (and sti I I do in places) extended over the
top and spi I led out onto the rol I ing hi I Is, these fields represent the
western edge of the Blackland Prairie, beginning only about a half
kilometer east of the site.
The environmental setting of the Brazi I Site is similar 1n many
respects to that of the McDonald Site. Situated on a low alluvial
terrace, it abuts the modern floodplain of Aqui I la Creek.
Located
some distance from the modern channel, it is possible that the
paleochannel associated with the site did not fol low the modern
course.
An apparent fi I led channel, which marks the eastern edge of
the site, may have been the course of the creek at the time of
occupation.
The Brazi I Site is somewhat closer to upland slope and
upland forested areas than the McDonald Site, but because these fol low
43-14

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
a narrow finger ridge projection, the former site is much farther from
the main Â·upland landform. Although oak forest is sti I I found on the
projecting upland remnant, only a very thin strip of riparian woodland
remains along the edge of the bank in this area.
A primary distinction between the two sites 1s that the Brazi I
Site I ies near the eastern edge of the Cross Timbers while the
McDonald Site I ies at the extreme western edge of the Black land
Prairie.
The immediate environment of both is, however, similarly
riparian. The major differences between the two I ie in the closeness
of the Brazi I Site to oak forest, it abuts and actually extends into
it, and the possible distance of the Brazi I Site from major upland
pra1r1e areas.
Fauna I materials were collected from al I three seasons of
excavation at the McDonald Site and a discussion of these is presented
in Chapter 38. Table 43.4 shows the species recovered, broken down by
area and cultural stratum. Figures given in this table are for number
of identified specimens (NISP) rather than m1n1mum numbers
of
individuals (MN!).
Although MNI figures are generally preferable,
since it is possible to calculate meat yield per individual animal
accurately,
there
are
a number of problems with such
more
calculations. Binford (1978) has criticized the standard calculation
of meat yield from MNI based on differential use of animal parts.
Yates (1982) has pointed out the difficulties in calculating MNI from
smal I samples where many species are represented by only one or two
bones. Additionally, the McDonald Site fauna I analysis was conducted
by two different analysts over three seasons of investigation.
Combination of the MNI figures, based on different elements for each
season, has been attempted but they probably represent under estimates
of the actual figures. Recognizing the potential errors that can
result from the comparison of SMU's ki localorie figures with NISP
fauna I material figures, a very general approximation 1s sti I I
generated.
In such a comparison, differential recovery becomes
important.
WHITETAIL DEER (ODOCOILEUS VIRGINIANUS)
As predicted by the SMU catchment analysis model, the whitetai I
deer is apparently the most commonly exploited faunal resource at the
McDonald Site. Based solely on the frequency of bones identified to
the species level alone, whitetai I deer comprise 10.4~ of the McDonald
Site faunal remains. The intentional fragmentation of deer bone for
marrow comp I icates the interpretation of this percentage, since many
bones probably attributable to this species are fragmented beyond
identification.
In fact, al I of the bone fragments identified simply
as large mammal remains probably represent large artiodactyls other
than bison (which is included in the extra large mammal category or
43-15

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
the bison category, based on bone wal I thickness).
In the Aqui I la
Lake area, such artiodactyls are I imited to whitetai I deer and
pronghorn (Anti locapra americana). Although pronghorn remains have
been identified from the site and from other Central Texas sites, the
density of this grassland loving species was apparently relatively low
in aboriginal Central Texas and may represent only a tiny fraction of
the total large mammal remains. The modern distribution of pronghorns
is restricted to the western half of Texas, from the Panhandle to the
lower Rio Grande area (Davis 1974:248). On the other hand, pronghorn
remains
are
difficult to identify without relatively complete
articular surfaces on bone elements and some misidentification of
material is possible.
A third possibi I ity is the occurrence of an
occasional mule deer (Odocoi leus hemionis), but the usual range of
this species is much farther to the west and would probably be
unexpected 1n the Aqui I la Lake fauna.
At present, their range is
restricted to the Trans-Pecos area and parts of the High Plains (Davis
1974:254).
A total of 71.1% of al I the identifiable fauna I remains from the
McDonald Site are attributed to large mammals. If these are assumed
to be whitetai I deer, this would bring the total percentage of
whitetai I remains to 81.5%, a figure even greater than the 66.2% meat
yield predicted by SMU.
Comparing such figures is, of course,
unrealistic.
Bone for bone, whitetai I deer yield a much larger
quantity of meat, on the order of ten times as much as other commonly
exploited smal I mammals (Skinner et al. 1978). Contrasted to this is
the extreme fragmentation of deer bone at the McDonald
Site,
suggesting that marrow extraction was an important activity. The true
percentage of exploitation may be somewhat closer to that suggested by
a comparison of the MNI figures for al I species.
Whatever the means of accounting, it is clear that whitetai I deer
were the single most important faunal resource at the McDonald Site,
both in terms of individuals and caloric yield. Such a circumstance
is not uncommon in Texas prehistoric sites. At Bear Creek Shelter at
nearby Lake Whitney (Murry 1978), whitetai I deer comprise the single
most numerous identified species throughout most of the cultural
strata, ranging from a low of 1.4% in the Middle Archaic levels up to
6.9% in the Austin phase materials. Deer are under represented in the
Late Archaic, where specimens of Sigmodon hispidus are more numerous,
and particularly in the Middle Archaic, where at least 10 species are
more numerous, but the addition of fragmentary material identified
only as large artiodactyls increases these totals dramatically.
Combined deer and large artiodactyl percentages, which presumably do
not include bison, generally rare at the site, range from a low of
13.1% for the Middle Archaic upwards to 37.3% for the Austin phase.
It is not. clear whether the low frequencies of deer in Late and Middle
Archaic levels are a function of the low sample size in these two

strata or actually represent lower use during these periods.
43-16

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION

Whitetai I deer remains also represent the most numerous single
identified species throughout the various strata at the Kyle Site
(Lundelius 1962). Other Lake Whitney sites show approximately similar
figures (Stephenson 1970). Farther to the south, whitetai I deer are
the most numerous species represented at both the Baylor and Britton
sites at Waco Reservoir, although the total sample is relatively smal I
in both cases (Story and Shafer 1965). The pronghorn is also present,
represented by only a few bones, at both the Baylor and Britten sites
as wel I as at the Kyle Site.
At the North Fork and Granger reservoirs on the San Gabriel River
(Yates 1982), whitetai I deer ranged from a low of 4.2% in the Clear
Fork horizon at 41WM73 up to 46.0% in the San Marcos component at
41WM124, for al I sites with a sample size of 100 or more bones.
Whitetai I deer are the most numerous single species at nine of 15
sites with larger sample sizes. It is possible that animal resources
were exploited that are not represented by large numbers of bones at
the McDonald Site.
Such an unrecorded contribution might have come
from dried meats or jerky, or larger animals butchered where they were
ki I led with only the meat being brought to camp. Although almost any
animal might have been butchered away from the camp, the most
important
single
resource, other than deer, which presents a
transportation problem is bison. Bison bones are present 1n smal I
quantity and wi I I be discussed in a subsequent section. They are
thought to have made a minimal contribution to the overal I subsistence
at the site.
Although it is not possible to readily quantify the actual
caloric intake from deer meat, the 66.2% figure estimated by SMU may
not be far wrong. This brings up two important points.
One, the
prehistoric population at the McDonald Site, and perhaps throughout
the Aqui I la Lake area, were highly dependent upon deer as a food
source.
Secondly, an aboriginal population of any size might have
placed some stress upon the reproductive potential of the deer
population.
This latter point is important because, although the
enormous reproductive potential of deer populations is wel I known (see
Smith
1975:24-26
and McCullough 1979:44-46), they tend to be
control led by exogenous factors, primarily the avai I able subsistence
base and predators.
Fluctuating deer populations, caused either by
excess predation from increased human population density or from
reduced subsistence resources from drought or extreme cold, may have,
1n turn, placed some stress on the aboriginal population.
The dangers of specialization upon a single resource are clear,
particularly if that resource has any hint of instabi I ity. The
percentage of deer in the diet suggests such extreme specialization,
43-17

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
but only the caloric intake from animals is considered here since
there is no preserved botanical information on the contribution to the
diet made by plant foods. In fact, many ethnographical ly documented
groups find a significant portion of their subsistence in plant foods.
TURTLES
Since it is almost impossible to calculate an accurate estimate
of individuals represented from a sample of turtle carapace and
plastron fragments, it is difficult to say what proportion of the
McDonald Site inhabitants' diet might have been made up by turtles.
The issue is further complicated by the possibi I ity that turtle shel I,
with its slightly different structure, may preserve differently than
bone.
Nonetheless, it is clear that turtles, which were
not
considered a major food source by the SMU catchment analysis (Skinner
et al. ms.), comprised an important source of food throughout most of
the strata at the McDonald Site.
The actual figures of 4.6% for pond sliders and 13.7% for al I
turtles, are useless except perhaps for comparison to percentages of
shel I fragments from other sites. The 2799 she I I fragments from the
McDonald Site could represent as few as 20 or 25 specimens, or many
more. The greater portion of the she I I fragments could not be
identified to species, age or size, making it difficult to estimate
meat yield.
Seven different turtle species have been identified in the
McDonald Site fauna I collection.
These include two species of the
genus Chrysemys Chr sem s scripta, the pond slider, and Chrysemys
concinna, the cooter , which comprise the largest portion of the
sample. Shel I fragments from Terrapene ornata, the western box
turtle, are a I ittle more than a fifth as numerous as the Chr sem s
specimens. Three species, Chelydra serpentina (snapping turtle ,
Trionyx cf.
spiniferous (spiny softshel I turtle) and Graptemys sp.
(map turtle), are represented by only a few specimens each.
At Bear Creek Shelter (Murray 1978), turtles are also an
important resource, ranging from 9.9% in the Middle Archaic zone up to
28.0% in the Austin phase stratum. Trionyx spiniferus comprise nearly
al I of the identified sample, although Chrysemys sp. was tentatively
identified (Murry 1978:56). At the nearby Kyle Site (lundel ius 1962),
turtles, I isted as softshel I and miscellaneous, comprise only a smal I
portion of the total sample.
Turtle shel I is present throughout most of the units at the
Baylor
Site in Mclennan County, compr1s1ng nearly 30% of the
identified bone elements (Story and Shafer 1965:132-133).
It is
present, but somewhat less common, at the nearby Britton Site, where
43-18

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
it comprises less than 10% of the elements identified. Only one genus
was identified, Trionyx sp., from a single element in each of the two
sites.
Sti I I further to the south in the North Fork and Granger
reservoirs, turtle elements ranged from barely 0.5% of the total in
the Late Prehistoric cultural strata at 41WM230 to more than 20% in
the Clear Fork component at 41WM56 and the mixed Clear Fork and Round
Rock component in Area B of 41WM73. While the pond slider (Chrysemys
scripta) appears to be the most frequently uti I ized species by a
slight margin, softshel I (Trionyx sp.), yellow mud
Kinosternon
flavescens), and other kinosterninae (musk and mud turtles are
strongly represented among water turtles, and box turtles (Terrapene
ornata) are also common.
The recovery of various turtle elements from a r1ver1ne site that
also yielded fish and pelecypod remains is not surprising. Land
turtles were uti I ized as wel I, however, and the box turtle, Terrapene
sp., 1s the most common identified genus after the pond slider,
Chrysemys sp. Various species of turtle are present in al I cultural
strata but are most common in the Late Prehistoric levels where they
account for nearly a third of al I elements recorded (31.0% in levels
8-13).
They are also most common in the Late Prehistoric levels at
Bear Creek Shelter (Murry 1978). Such a trend does not seem to be
present in the Late Prehistoric sites in the North Fork and Granger
Lake areas (Yates 1982).
Not a great deal has been written about
the
aboriginal
exploitation of freshwater turtles.
Smith (1975:10-14, 100-102)
specifically lists snapping turtles (Chelydrinae) as a secondary food
resource of the Middle Mississippi groups, ranking ninth overal I in
total projected meat yield. He speculates that:
It is entirely possible, of course, that snapping turtles,
and
other
species
of
aquatic
turtles, were never
deliberately hunted, but rather were collected along with
fish
during
the
continual
summer
harvest
from
ever-diminishing shallow backwater lake areas.
Such a possibi I ity seems remote at many Central Texas sites where
turtle carapaces greatly outnumber fish bones and scales, but this
difference may be a function of the poor preservabi lity of fish bone
and the relatively excel lent preservation of carapace and plastron.
In any case, turtles may never have been actively hunted, but only
gathered when observed basking on shoals or foraging on banks.

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
Ube laker and Hal I (1972:248-9) report 11 species of turtles from
the Aqui I la Lake project area, while Slack and Marcy (1982) were only
able to document five. The aboriginal remains include at least six
species (note:
Chrysemys includes two species, scripta, the pond
slider, and cocinna, the river cooter, both recorded but combined for
the table).
The specimens are representative of al I the reportedly
occurring groups with the exception of the family Kinosternidae and
one genus 1n the family Emydidae, suggesting that the aboriginal
population was not highly selective in its choices.
SMALL MAMMALS
No other single resource approaches deer or turtle in the total
number of elements identified within the sample, with the exception of
shel If ish, which, although numerous, may not have been as important a
contribution to the McDonald Site diet as smal I mammals. Skinner et
al. (1978), in their catchment analysis of the Aqui I la Lake area,
projected five smal I mammals; raccoon, opossum, cottontai I rabbit,
fox squirrel and blacktailed jackrabbit, as significant secondary
resources after whitetai I deer. In their projections, the greatest
caloric contribution was made by the fox squirrel, with raccoon and
then opossum, both with fewer individuals captured but greater body
weights, each contributing a I ittle less than three-fourths of the
squirrel total.
Next in order of importance were the cottontai I
rabbit, contributing less than a third of the squirrel total, and the
blacktai led jackrabbit, contributing a bit more than a fourth of the
squirrel total.
Al I of the projected species are present at the McDonald Site,
although none of them contribute the projected amounts. Bones of the
cottontai I rabbit, Sy I vi lagus sp., are the most numerous, being more
than twice as common as the other four combined. Ratio of identified
deer bone to cottontai I rabbit bone is about 37:1.
Given the meat
yield estimates of 100 pounds for deer and 1.75 pounds for rabbit,
this returns a meat yield ratio of 2100:1. This calculation assumes,
albeit somewhat tenuously, that the number of individuals consumed is
directly proportional to the number of identifiable bone elements
present.
Although there are certain problems with this assumption,
notably potentially different preservation and differential breakage
for marrow consumption, the ratio is vastly greater than the 67:1
ratio predicted by the SMU catchment model. This suggests that rabbit
and other smal I mammals were less heavily exploited than predicted.
Using the same calculating procedure as above, a total deer to smal I
mammal meat yield ratio, using weight estimates from Skinner et
al. 1978, at the McDonald Site is 1072:1, comparing unfavorably to the
predicted meat yield ratio of 9:1 calculated from the SMU model.

43-20

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
Other than rodents, which form a comparatively smal I portion of
the McDonald Site fauna and some of which may be recent, only two
other smal I mammals are recorded; beaver and wolf (as wel I as other
unidentified can id remains). The wolf, found in the upper levels of
Area A of the McDonald Site, is a nearly complete skeleton and appears
to postdate aboriginal occupation. The other canid remains, al I from
Area B, are probably from at least three individuals and may be either
dog or coyote.
Beaver is represented by eight elements, including
several teeth and a mandible fragment, from both areas of the site.
Smal I mammals are a more prominent part of the fauna I assemblage
at
nearby
Bear Creek Shelter at Lake Whitney (Lynott 1978).
Cottontai I rabbit is by far the most common, with an elemental ratio
of identified deer to rabbit bone of less than 3:1. Using the SMU
meat weight figures, this would yield a meat weight ratio of 458:1,
showing a much greater proportion of rabbit than at the McDonald Site.
The range of smal I mammals at Bear Creek Shelter is about the same as
at the McDonald Site, without any specimens of opossum, but with skunk
(Mephitis mephitis) and bobcat ~ rufus) represented by a few
elements each.
At the North Fork and Granger Lake areas, cottontai I rabbit
percentages (in sites with larger samples) comprise from less than 1~
to nearly 15~ of al I bones, with the lowest percentages seemingly
occurring 1n Late Archaic (Twin Sisters) and Late Prehistoric sites
(Yates 1982). Blacktai led jackrabbit is the second most important
smal I mammal in most of the larger sites, with beaver a distant third.
Fox squirrels are present at many sites in very low percentages, while
opossum and raccoon are sporadically present in variable percentages.
Badger (Taxidea taxa), not noted in the Hi I I County sites, with the
exception of a few-elements recorded at the Kyle Site (Jelks 1962), 1s
present in several North Fork and Granger sites.
Although the five smal I mammals predicted to be secondary food
resources in the Aquil la Lake aboriginal diet are present in the
faunal remains from the McDonald Site, they do not comprise the
proportion anticipated in the catchment analysis. Despite its smal I
size, cottontai I rabbit appears to be the most important smal I mammal,
both numerically and in total meat yield at the McDonald Site as it
appears to be in many other Central Texas sites.
Fox squirrel,
predicted to be the second greatest contributor to the animal portion
of the diet, is barely present, as are the other larger members of
this
group,
raccoon and opossum, and the other leporid, the
blacktai led jackrabbit. The samples of each of these other smal I
mammals are so smal I that it is difficult to assess if any one made a
larger contribution than the others. Al I of the projected secondary
smal I mammals besides cottontai Is were recovered from Late Prehistoric
portions of the site, a factor that might be attributed to sampling.
43-21

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
The reason for the predominance of cottontai I rabbit in this
sample may I ie in the overal I density of rabbits, or the relative ease
with which they can be caught.
Fox squirrels, being arboreal and
perhaps a bit difficult to snare as wel I as providing a smal I meat
yield, might be a minimally uti I ized resource. Raccoon and opossum,
while larger than the rabbit and providing more meat, are nocturnal
animals, and may occur at lower density levels than the rabbit. Also,
although the Hi I I County area appears to be within the range of the
blacktai led jackrabbit (Hulbert 1984), they are much less common than
the cottontai I.
MUSSELS
Shellfish are one of the most important supplementary resources
at the McDonald Site, possibly far surpassing the minor role assigned
them in the SMU catchment analysis model. Although the evidence is
difficult to assess, mussel might be the most important dietary
element after whitetai I deer at the site.
A calculation of the
approximate meat weight, using approximations from Table 39.3 in the
McKenzie Site chapter, of the m1n1mum number of individuals from
counted valves (only a sample of the mussels recovered during 1982 was
identified - the actual total is probably somewhere near twice the
figure given), gives a total meat weight of 27.5 kilograms, equal to
the weight of about 22 cottontai I rabbits or more than half of a
single deer.
Mussels, however, have only a bit more than half the
calories and protein per gram that deer or rabbit meat have, so the
number of individuals must be correspondingly decreased to account for
the nutritional properties of the mussel.
Obviously, I ike other secondary resources at the site, mussels
are only a fraction of the whitetai I deer totals. They also compare
favorably with other minor resources at the site, such as rabbit and
turtle.
Although
turtle cannot be accurately quantified, the
comparison to rabbit suggests that mussel may have been a more
important contributor to the diet, since the total MNI for rabbits,
although not formally calculated, probably lies at around
ten
individuals.
If the unsampled mussel is estimated and the caloric
calculations made, it would leave the mussel at just under twice the
caloric potential of those ten rabbits. Preservation factors must be
taken into account, and the differences in methods of counting minimum
number of individuals. The samples are probably inadequate to suggest
that mussels were definitely a more important contributor than all
smal I mammals but they are certainly an important resource.
Because of widely ranging collection techniques, it is not easy
to compared molluscan fauna between sites. At the McKenzie Site, the
other major mussel gathering site at Aqui I la Lake, the order of
prominence of the species collected is nearly identical to that at the
43-22

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
McDonald Site. At both sites, Amblema pl icata is the most important
species, with Lampsi lis hydiana the most important secondary species.
Quadrula apiculata comprises a substantial
percentage
of
the
assemblage from both sites, while Lampsi I is teres makes up a large
portion of the McDonald Site pelecypod fauna. At Bear Creek Shelter
(Lynott 1978:71) ~
pl icata is a relatively minor species, fal I ing
fourth after Obovaria olovaria, Cyrtonaias tampicoensis and Potami lus
purpuratus.
.Q_,:.
ol ivaria was not recorded from the Aqui I la Lake
sites, nor, as Lynott (1978:72) notes, had it been previously recorded
anywhere in Texas, while the latter two were very minor components.
L. hydiana and!:.:_ teres are both present at Bear Creek Shelter but
as minor species.
Although the differences may be partially a
function of the different drainages, the Bear Creek Shelter fauna may
be largely a Brazos River fauna.
BISON
The contribution of bison to the diet of the inhabitants of the
McDonald Site is not entirely clear. Numerically, skeletal elements
comprise the second largest identified mammal species at the site.
Bison bone accounts for almost three times the total of cottontai I
rabbit. Roe (1970:57-61) I ists some reported ranges of size for
bison, including one bul I with an edible meat weight of 800 pounds.
Given that an adult bison may provide as much as 500 times the meat
yield of a rabbit, it is possible that bison contributed significantly
to the avai I able resources at the site.
Despite the enormous potential significance of bison as a food
resource, its actua I over a 11 contribution may have been neg I i g i b I e
through time. In the first place, bison has a restricted distribution
at the site, generally occurring only in the uppermost cultural
levels. No bison bone was recovered below Level 8 in Area B, or below
the top cu I tura I I eve I in Area A.
Second I y, perhaps on I y two
individuals are represented by the large number of bones: one in Area
A and a second in Area B. The specimen in Area B, a juvenile only
tentatively identified as a bison, was found above
the
Late
Prehistoric cultural layers, in a stratum that yielded a few other
bones and a very few tiny flakes. Cut marks on the specimen suggest
that it was butchered, but the lack of tools or significant quantities
of debitage in the layer with the bones suggests that they represent a
single individual that was ki I led and butchered on the spot after the
last major campsite occupation.

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
OTHER FAUNAL RESOURCES
One other animal, the turkey (Meleagris galopavo), was included
by SMU in its I ist of secondary fauna I resources area (Skinner et
al. 1978), while 29 other species or animal groups are I isted as
additional potential game resources.
Of these latter, turtles and
she I If ish have been described above as rather important secondary
resources, while beaver has been included with the smal I mammal group.
Many of the remaining potential game resources are either absent or
present in such smal I numbers as to be of questionable value as a food
resource. A few of the minor resource groups from the McDonald Site
are discussed briefly here.
In addition to turtles and she I If ish, fish were probably of some
importance, adding emphasis to the inhabitants' ful I utilization of
the avai Iable resources of the site's riverine setting. Fish remains
are not present in great quantity, and it is not clear if this might
be due to only minimal use of this resource, the poor preservation
qua I ity of fish bones or perhaps a special method of disposal. Gar
scales (Lepisosteus sp.), which preserve relatively wel I, are the most
common single item, present in some quantity in Area A and throughout
the Late Prehistoric levels in Area 8. However, the overal I number of
scales is smal I, much less than would be present on a single fish. In
addition to gar, bones were identified from the
bass
family
(Centrachidae) and catfish (Ictalurus sp.).
No fish remains were
recovered from the Archaic levels.
Several different species of birds are present 1n the faunal
sample, not al I of which may have been consumed by the inhabitants.
Turkey (Meleagris galopavo) bones are the most common, primarily from
Area A, but five other species are present as wel I. Crow (Corvus
brachyus) was represented by three bones in Area A.
The rema1n1ng
specimens,
al I
represented
by
a single element, include an
unidentified duck or teal (Anas sp.), a hawk (Juteo sp.), a member of
the finch or sparrow family (Fringi I I idae
and a bobwhite quai I
(Col inus virginianus). The hawk bone is the only identified bird bone
from the Archaic levels.
Rodents are fairly common at the site, although much less so than
at Bear Creek Shelter on Lake Whitney (Lynott 1978). Beaver has been
mentioned in the section above on smal I mammals.
Most of the
rema1n1ng rodents are smaller and, while the number of bones is
greater than many other species, it is not clear that they contributed
to the diet. Some of the rodent bones appear to be more recent; some
individuals may have died in burrows after the occupation of the site.
Few, if any, of the bones can be convincingly noted as burned or
broken by human agency.

43-24

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
The relatively smal I size of the fauna I sample from the site and
the predominance of deer make any comparative study of these minor
food resources statistically worthless. Many of the species included
here, the bones of some of which were burned or spirally fractured,
were obviously used by the inhabitants. Some of the species, however,
may have been incidental to the site. In a study of the burned and
spirally fractured bones from the 1980 season, Rawn-Schatzinger (1982,
1983) found, in addition to numerous specimens from turtle, deer and
various other mammals, only one blackened turkey bone and slightly
charred single specimens from an indeterminate fish and a crotal id
snake. By contrast, more than 6~ of al I identifiable deer bones were
burned, and a much greater percentage of indeterminate large mammal
bone fragments. With the exception of a single turkey bone, spiral or
green bone fractures occurred only on various mammal bones.
INTERPRETATIONS
As noted above, whitetai I deer comprise the largest sample from
the site. Adding the indeterminate large mammal remains which, other
than deer, could only have included antelope as a secondary resource
in proportion to its scarcity in the region prehistorically, yields a
proportion that is close to the SMU estimate of deer as providing
about two-thirds of the available animal calories.
Deer are an
attractive resource, being large and not very difficult to hunt, and
they are the predominate species in almost every faunal sample from a
Central or East Texas site. Deer comprise the largest proportion at
both open sites and rockshelters along the Balcones Escarpment, as
seen at the North Fork and Granger Lake areas as wel I as at Lake
Whitney further to the north. They are also the most important faunal
resource by meat yield at many East Texas sites such as George
C. Davis Site (41CE19) in Cherokee County (Keller 1974:158) and the
Tadlock Site (x41WD39) on Lake Fork Creek in Wood County (Perrtula and
Bruseth 1983).
In reality, the high percentage of deer bones says I ittle about
specialized adaptations at the site, since few sites, with the
exception of short term special activity sites such as McKenzie, wi I I
not have such an assemblage. On the other hand, the high percentage
of deer suggests a dependence on this resource, although not to the
exclusion of other resources.
Some attempts to model prehistoric resource use in other parts of
the country have indicated that deer might not be the primary
resource, at least not throughout the entire year, in a least cost
resource procurement solution.
Reidhead (1980) predicted that deer
would rank fourth in Late Woodland animal uti I ization at the Leonard
Haag Site in II linois, with fish, mussel and turtle ranking higher in
43-25

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
a four seasonal aggregate model. In actuality, examination of fauna I
remains from the site showed that deer ranked first, with fish, mussel
and turtle ranked tenth, eleventh and nineth respectively.
In attempting to explain the differences between the model and
the actual recovered animal remains, Reidhead notes that mussel and
turtles were included because they are rich sources of calcium.
If
the calcium needs of the population were satisfied in some other way,
such as calcium-rich water in the limestone bedrock area, then mussels
and turtles would drop out of the optimal solution altogether, moving
the hypothetical ranking of deer second only to fish. Jochim (1983),
however, argues that the nutritional model offered by Reidhead is
needlessly complex, when a simple model based on animal size and
abundance more closely approximates the actual ranking found at the
site.
The SMU catchment analysis is essentially a size-abundance model,
that uses not only size and abundance but nutritional data and a
measure of procurement costs as wel I. Yet the lack of fit for the SMU
model, outside of deer and perhaps cottontai I rabbit, is striking.
Two possibilities are offered for this. Either the data on species
abundance for the Aqui Ila Lake area is incorrect, thus altering the
model, or other factors, such as nutrition or procurement costs, are
also
important.
Both
of
these possibi I ities may be partly
responsible.

quantitative data is available for the occurrence of either resource
in the Aqui I la Lake or Cross Timbers area. Both reproduce themselves
rather slowly, and given the relatively smal I area of aquatic habitat
in the catchment area, it is unlikely that they would rival cottontai I
rabbit 1n total annual harvestable yield.
They may, however, be
numerically more important than many of the other smal I mammal or bird
species.
The lack of adequate quantification makes further speculation
difficult, but one point is important. It was noted above that the
reason for the apparent under representation of the fox squirrel in
fauna I collections is the high procurement cost relative to the size
of meat yield. Procurement costs may be a factor in the exploitation
of turtles and mussels. Mussels, whose search time costs are relative
to some level of knowledge of the area and the preferred habitat
types, have essentially no pursuit costs and may require only minimal
preparation. Turtles, which may be easily spotted while sunning, are
slower and .perhaps easier to prepare than many smal I mammals.

It could be speculated that turtles and mussels were important to

extensive I imestone deposits in the Aqui I la Lake area might make the
acquisition of calcium a resource procurement behavior that is
selected for through time.
If aquatic resources were important as
providers of calcium, it might indicate that the local groups did not
spend much time along the Brazos River with its I imestone bluffs and
calcium rich water.
As predicted by the SMU catchment analysis model, deer are
clearly indicated as a primary food resource. This was the case at
the Leonard Haag Site (Reidhead 1980), the Tadlock Site (Perrtula and
Bruseth 1983) and in the two faunal exploitation models that served as
primary inspirations for the SMU model, the Middle Mississippi study
of Smith (1975) and the Davis Site Caddo study of Keller (1974). At
the McDonald Site, deer appear to make an even more important
contribution to the animal diet than predicted by the model. The
under representation of lesser ranked species in the diet may indicate
that there was no stress on the total resources of the area, so that
only the most highly prized resource need be taken. Such a condition
could come about if plant foods contributed heavily to the diet and
meat was only a supplement, perhaps as important to prestige as to
nutrition.
The other possible causal factor would be a much lower
population in the area than the catchment analysis predicts as near
carrying capacity.
It wQuld be no surprise if plant foods did not contribute greatly
to the Aqui I la Lake diet, nor if the population was maintained below
theoretical carrying capacity. Such conditions are not unknown 1n
ethnographical ly documented hunter and gatherer populations. However,
it would be difficult, if not impossible, to assess such possibi I ities
with avai Iable data.
Even data from pollen or plant macrofossi Is
could not serve to estimate the true dietary mix. Only the uni ikely
possibility that some coprol ites might be recovered from cave sites in
the region would yield data on this. Although uni ikely, it is not
impossible, since the Kyle Site at Lake Whitney (Jelks 1962) yielded
fairly wel I preserved specimens.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Even lacking evidence for the actual diet of the aboriginal
inhabitants of Aqui I la Lake, it 1s possible to speculate on the
overal I use of resources in the study area. Two important facts are
clear.
First, whitetai I deer were a primary animal protein source,
almost to the exclusion of al I other species. If the bones can be
taken as any indication, as much as 90% of al I fauna I ki localories
43-27

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION
were provided by deer. Secondly, the enormous amount of avai I able
plants provided a relatively stable food source with a potential
caloric yield as much as a hundred times greater than that from fauna!
resources.
The emphasis on deer among faunal resources may be an indication
of the lack of resource scarcity in the local population and
concentration upon the primary resource. The extreme emphasis on deer
at the McDonald Site is not necessarily the rule at other Central
Texas sites. While deer are frequently the single most important
species, they are not always so dominant. Also, the data from a
single campsite is not sufficient to make an unqualified extrapolation
to the rest of Aqui I la Lake or to the Central Brazos region.
The amount of estimated avai !able floral resources at Aquil la
Lake
totals
10,909,800,000
ki localories,
in contrast to the
137,051,207 ki localories projected by SMU. Obviously, such a figure
would provide food for a relatively large population.
Several
adjustments must be made, however. First, the apparent importance of
deer is corrected for, and animals, such as fox squirrels, not clearly
represented in the fauna I remains are heavily modified or dropped from
the original SMU model. Table 43.5 below shows the modified estimates
for deer, mol lusca, turtle, rabbit, other smal I mammals and other
resources (including fish, birds, and at times, bison). Note that the
total amount is less than the SMU total. This is intended to reflect
the complete dominance of deer and the apparent lack of stresses that
might have forced partial dependence on lesser resources.
It might
also have been useful to drop the total figure for deer exploitation,
in order to further reflect the lack of resource stress, but such a
reduction could be I ittle more than arbitrary.
Therefore, as a
comparative base I ine to the SMU study, the deer exploitation figure
has remained unchanged.
If the total estimated food resources available to the aboriginal
inhabitants was uti I ized, the fauna I total from Table 43.5 would
comprise less than 1% of the total subsistence. One percent is wel I
below the 2Q% minimum found in nearly al I ethnographic sources (Lee
1968:42). It is thus possible to suggest that the Aqui I la Lake
peoples were probably selective about plant resources, harvesting far
less than the maximum avai I able. In the same article cited above, Lee
(1968:33) points out that after the harvest of tens of thousands of
pounds of mongongo nuts, the primary Bushman subsistence item,
thousands more rot on the ground each year, unpicked.
Obviously, al I of the avai I able plant foods cannot be harvested
for one reason or another. Birds, arboreal mammals and small ground
dwelling animals consume a portion, and the major competitor for the
resources, particularly hardwood nuts, may be the principal faunal

resource, whitetai I deer. In addition, a number of fruits and nuts
never properly ripen, or rot on the tree. And finally, perfect
harvest scheduling is likely to be impossible, particularly with some
fruits which may mature and rot quickly if not visited at the precise
time.
In his study of the ecology of the Caddo, Keller (1974:144)
accepts a figure of 30% for al I such losses. This figure may be too
low for the maintenance of a viable animal population and to account
for potential losses as wel I. Keller himself I ists a potential 34% in
losses from arboreal mammals and defective nuts alone.
A figure of
50% is used here to account for the total of such losses. This would
leave the resources of the 10 kilometer radius area at 5,454,900,000
ki localories.
In order to calculate the possible uti I ization of this resource
potential, a few diets can be hypothesized with meat percentages
within typical ranges for hunter gatherers. Lee (1968:43) notes that,
except in the highest latitudes, hunted foods generally constitute
from 20 to 45% of the diet. If the percentage of meat at Aqui Ila Lake
were near the minimum, 20%, then only 380 mi I I ion calories worth of
plant foods would be consumed in the remaining 80%, or only about 7%
of the adjusted total of avai Iable floral resources. At 35% meat
intake, a figure Lee cites as the apparent median (the Bushman meat
intake is 37%), about 176.4 mi I I ion calories of plant food would
supplement the diet. And for a maximum meat consumption figure of
50%, only 95 million calories of plant foods would be consumed.
43-29

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION

If it were assumed that gatherers might forage shorter distances
than hunters, then it is possible to calculate comparative foraging
areas for each of these percentages. If the 20% of meat in the diet
were recovered from the whole of the ten kilometer catchment area,
then the plant food foragers would have to cover an area with a radius
of about 2.6 kilometers to gather the estimated 380 mi I I ion calories
avai I able after a 50% reduction for losses. Correspondingly, at the
35% level, foragers would need a plant food catchment area with a
radius of 1.8 kilometers, and at the 50% level, only an area with a
radius of 1.3 kilometers.
Another approach to the use of these potential yield figures is
to calculate various potential population sizes.
The fol lowing
calculations use a rounded figure of 2000 calories per day per person,
essentially the same as that computed for the Aqui I la Lake population
(Skinner et al. 1978) and those found by Lee (1968) for the Bushman
population.
Using the 50% plant food figure and the ful I animal
resource figure, a total of 5,549.9 mi I I ion calories, al lows a
population of 7602 persons, a figure obviously high for a prehistoric
hunter gatherer population.
Another approach is to use Zubrow's
(1971:132) 5% human resource exploitation figure, as Keller (1974:156)
did in the Caddo region.
Five percent of the total avai I able
resources, eliminating the 50% plant food reduction, of 11,059.8
mi I lion calories would support a population of 758 persons, a much
more reasonable figure. Yet another approach is to use the 35% meat
utilization figure calculated above.
The 271.4 mi I I ion calories
avai I able would support a population of 372 people in the area.
While none of the figures can be actually verified, some
population density parameters can be calculated. For 758 persons, the
population density would be 2.41 persons per square kilometer (.024
persons per hectare), and for a population of 372 persons, the density
would be 1.18 persons per square kilometer (.012 persons per hectare).
To put it differently, a band of 25 persons in the Aqui I la Lake
catchment area, with an annual requirement of 18.25 mi I I ion calories,
would be using the area to less than .2% efficiency, an extremely low
figure. Operating at a 5% efficiency ratio, the same band would need
to exploit a territory of only 10.4 square kilometers, an area with a
radius of only 1.8 kilometers.
With a subsistence territory of this size, the establishment of
permanent settlements might be expected. The archeological evidence
does not support any trend toward a sedentary I ifestyle.
Rather,
figures such as these suggest either a gross over estimation of the
avai I able resources, or populations that existed below the carrying
capacity of the land. Some over estimation of resources is probable.

a serious error.
Modern yield figures may also be off the mark.
Nonetheless, there is at least some evidence to suggest that the
Aqui I la Lake and perhaps the Central Brazos populations may have
existed at wel I below the carrying capacity of the land.
Figures

AQUILLA LAKE: A CULTURE HISTORY PERSPECTIVE

David 0. Brown

This chapter provides an admittedly speculative discussion of the
development of the aboriginal Central Brazos peoples from the point of
view of Aqui I la Lake. The central data base for this discussion is
the corpus of sites from Aqui I la Lake and the diagnostic artifacts
collected from them during ten years of archeological projects.
This
section is divided into broad cultural periods, not in the belief that
there is something inherently important about these divisions, but as
an organizational device.
More specific chronological control has
been sought by utilizing Prewitt's (1981) Central Texas Archaic phases
(see chapters 4 and 5).
Use of these phases does not imply that
Aqui I la Lake fal Is neatly within Central Texas, or even that the
proposed scheme is without problems. It does, however, provide, a
base from which an argument for the regional culture history of
Aqui I la Lake and the Central Brazos region can be developed. A brief
summary is provided in the concluding chapter of this report.
PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Only two of the sites recorded within the Aqui I la Lake area
contain apparent Paleoindian components. These are 41HI189 (x41HI93);
a site on the edge of the Pleistocene terrace on the left bank of
Aqui I la Creek a I ittle more than a kilometer upstream from its
confluence with Hackberry Creek, and 41HI117 (Sul Ii van Site
x41HI111);
described in detai I elsewhere in this report. Surface
collection at 41HI189 in 1972 yielded a projectile point base similar
to what Watt (1978) has cal led the Brazos Fishtai I type. This site,
revisited in 1975, could not be relocated during the Management Data
Survey. It is reportedly a very thin scatter of lithic materials from
The
which no other temporally diagnostic artifacts were collected.
Sul I ivan Site, on one or more low fossi I terraces along the right bank
of Aqui I la Creek about seven kilometers above its confluence with
Hackberry Creek, has yielded several Plainview projectile points, as
wel I as other unidentified Paleoindian-1 ike specimens that may be
44-1

CULTURE HISTORY
contemporaneous or earlier. Most of these Paleoindian specimens were
site,
observed in the collection of the former owner of the
H.D. Sul Ii van. One other specimen was observed, but not collected, on
the surface (D. Dibble, personal communication, 1982). Several other
local sites have possible Paleoindian components. One site along Cobb
Creek and outside of the lake area, x41Hl147, yielded a projectile
point that may be a Plainview, but could be a somewhat later
lanceolate as wel I. A projectile point recovered from the Brazi I Site
(41Hl75), is typed in this report (Chapter 31) as a reworked
Plainview. This specimen is felt to be located in an Early Archaic
context and is discussed further in that section. Additionally, the
base of an unidentified fluted projectile point was collected during
the Management Data Survey from the highly disturbed surface of
41Hl167 (x41HI121). A fluted projectile point basal fragment was
reportedly observed on the surface of 41HI195 (x41HI165) during the
1975 investigations (Lynott and Peter 1977:140).
Figure 44.1 shows
these sites.
Based on five Horn Shelter radiocarbon dates pub I ished by Watt
(1978), the Brazos Fishtai I projectile point dates to sometime between
about 9500 and 10,785 B.P. Since the oldest of these dates is based
on shel I, a more realistic estimate of the dating of this point type
probably fal Is closer to the end of this period.
Stratigraphical ly,
these
Horn
Shelter
specimens were found underlying Plainview
projectile points and overlying a single Folsom specimen.
Watt's Brazos Fishtai I type is similar to other early projectile
points from Texas and surrounding states. The specimens i I lustrated
by Watt, as wel I as the specimen from Aqui I la Lake, are similar to
those recovered from the Rex Rodgers Site (418142) on Tule Creek in
Briscoe County.
Hughes and Wi I ley (1978:66-7) point
out
the
similarities of what they cal I Rodgers side-hollowed projectile points
to types such as Hardaway and Dalton from the southeastern United
States, Simonsen from western Iowa and San Patrice points from east
Texas and Louisiana. The San Patrice type;- which includes several
variants, has been generaTTy thought of as Late Paleoindian or Early
Archaic (Duffield 1962; Webb, Shiner and Roberts 1971).
Although
there are few, if any, good dates on the San Patrice type, recent
examination of the dating of the Dalton culture (Goodyear 1982)
suggests its contemporaneity with the Brazos Fishtai I projectile point
style. Based on the presence of two untyped lanceolate projectile
points,
Hughes
and Wi I ley (1978:67-8) argue that the Rodgers
side-hollowed points date to the Paleoindian Period.
A radiocarbon
date on bone apatite from the Rex Rodgers Site yields a "minimum"
corrected age of 9391 B.P. (Speer 1978:94), somewhat more recent than
Watt's Brazos Fishtai I dates.

CULTURE HISTORY

Watt's (1978) early dates for his Brazos Fishtai I type and its
stratigraphic placement below Plainview, further comp I icate the once
seemingly simple tripartite Paleoindian succession of Clovis, Folsom
and Plainview.
The early side hollowed projectile points, such as
Brazos Fishtai I, seem to be most closely related to similar specimens,
such as Dalton, Hardaway and San Patrice, that form part of the broad
eastern Paleoindian tradition. Although there is a certain amount of
I icense in combining a number of diverse and as yet not wel I
understood Paleoindian complexes within a single tradition, it seems
that there are certain gross similarities in projectile point forms
which separate parts of the Great Plains and the western United States
from the eastern United States. One of the more interesting aspects
of this broad pattern is the potential for interaction along the
frontier areas.
Myers and Lambert (1983) propose that the Meserve
projectile point of the central Great Plains is an in situ development
of
the
Plains
gallery forest environment that---piral lels the
development of the Dalton point 1n the Woodlands to the east.
Goodyear's (1982:382-3) earlier argument that the relatively rare
Meserve type may be occasional reworked lanceolates is addressed by
Myers and Lambert but their argument for resharpening as a diagnostic
feature is not conclusive. A re-analysis and comparison of data on
other aspects of Meserve and Dalton cultures might be in order.
An interesting comparable overlap between these two broadly
defined traditions is found in the occurrence of the early side
hollowed points in the Central Brazos region and even further west.
Folsom projectile points are rare in the Central Brazos and further to
the east. Relatively isolated single occurrences such as at Horn
Shelter No. 2 (Watt 1978) and at the Davis Site (Shafer 1973:174) mark
the pattern of their easternmost distribution. Watt's Brazos Fishtai I
and similar specimens appear to be more common in Central and East
Texas.
It is tempting to speculate on the possible spread of the side
hol lowed/fishtai I type through East Texas and into the wooded areas of
the Cross Timbers as marking their westernmost extent. To some degree
this is probably true;
these specimens may represent a woodland
adapted culture. Their occurrence on the southern High Plains at a
bison ki I I with other lanceolates and at a site noted for its Folsom
point manufacturing sequence (Hughes and Wi I ley 1978;
Tunnel I 1977)
discourage such a facile view, however.
Nonetheless, this side
hollowed type is apparently contemporaneous with, and shows strong
affinities to, types common throughout the eastern United States.
Radiocarbon dates from the Central Brazos (Watt 1968) and from
Missouri (Goodyear 1982) suggest contemporaneity of the side hollowed
type with Paleoindian lanceolates from the High
Plains.
The
association of this type with lanceolates at the Rex Rodgers Site and

at the Adair-Steadman Site appears to support this coexistence.
44-4

CULTURE HISTORY

The paucity of specimens and the lacunae in our knowledge of the
distribution of Paleoindian assemblages along the Plains-Woodland
frontier hinders the understanding of potential interaction between
these two areas. The evidence seems to accord wel I with the concept
of Central Texas as an ecotonal region as proposed by Shafer (1977a),
as wel I as that of shifting cultural boundaries in broad ecotones
(Gunn 1979). Although the frequent misuse of the ecotonal concept
probably demands the careful qua I ification of ecotone in this usage,
it is not difficult to view Central Texas as a transitional zone
between two broad cultural traditions. Central Texas is marked by a
relatively diverse resource base that might be attractive to cultures
I iving to either side.
In this case, the transitional zone may
contain resources, such as Edwards chert, which are unique to the
"ecotone".
Shafer (1977a) has suggested that the early inhabitants of the
Central Texas area may have led a I ifestyle more akin to an Archaic
hunter gatherer tradition than to the classic Plains big game hunters.
Skinner et al. (1978:122) have criticized this notion, indicating that
the data base may contain sites with mixed components. They do not,
however, go so far as to propose a singular big game hunting tradition
within the Aqui I la area. Skinner's suggestion that these Paleoindian
groups had widely ranging territories is attractive. Although he
proposes an exploitative strategy that extends westward to the Plains,
it is suggested here that there are two generally contemporaneous
strategies, each encompassing broad areas that overlap within the
Central Texas region.
To the west and northwest, the Paleoindian
culture of the Plains maintained a big game hunting specialization,
occasionally
moving south and east into Central Texas, either
fol lowing game movements or climatic shifts, and probably using the
local resources while there. The eastern Paleoindian tradition of the
Hardaway-Dalton complex occasionally moved westward to the edge of the
Plains, again making use of avai I able resources.
Extending the above broad ecotonal concept for the succeeding
Plano complex occ~pations is more difficult because of the lack of a
suitable eastern tradition complement.
One fact seems clear.
In
Central Texas, Plainview projectile points appear to be more common
than al I of the previous Paleoindian point types combined. Toward the
east of the Central Texas culture area, however, Plainview and similar
lanceolate forms disappear rapidly. Although these forms may have
spanned a somewhat longer time period than their predecessors (see
Wi I ley 1966:45-46), sheer numbers seem to suggest some expansion of
population, at least within the Central Texas area. Despite this
increase, there is I ittle clear evidence for the extensive uti I ization
of bison by the late Paleoindian hunters of North Central Texas.
44-5

CULTURE HISTORY
Evidence of bison exploitation during this period has been primarily
concentrated to the south and southwest or wel I to the west (see
Di I lehay 1974). Nonetheless, even though it is I ikely that the Plano
complex peoples enjoyed a wider subsistence resource base than
previous populations, the fauna! and floral evidence from the North
Central Texas region is basically non-existent.
The fol lowing scenario is suggested for the Aqui I la Lake area,
and the Central Brazos as wel I. Although finds of Clovis projectile
points in the Central Brazos are rare, they have been reported and it
is probable that a smal I population of these Llano complex hunters
used the region sparingly.
Subsequent to this, the region was
apparently within the exploitative sphere of two major Paleoindian
traditions, extending west and east from the Central Texas boundary.
Although the total number of either group was smal I, the paucity of
Folsom points, and their absence from the Aqui I la lake area, may
indicate that the eastern Brazos Fishtai I tradition had an edge on the
use of the area. In any case, population may not have been great.
As global climates became warmer at the end of the Pleistocene,
and major fauna! and vegetative changes were beginning to take place,
the woodland adapted eastern Paleoindian tradition seems to have
retreated eastward, leaving the region open for use by the Plains
hunters of the Plano complex. Gradual drying and the disappearance of
woodland areas 1n Central and North Central Texas may have made the
area more attractive to the savannah adapted bison and the bison
adapted Plainview and other Late Paleoindian hunters.
Skinner et al. {1978:122-123) have proposed a number of traits to
characterize the material culture remains of Late Paleoindian and
Early Archaic hunters of the Central Brazos, such
as
smal I,
functionally specific sites and poorly developed refuse middens, owing
to brief occupations.
These hypothesized characteristics can be
altered
to better fit the above model of Paleoindian culture
development in the region. Al I of these criteria would undoubtedly
apply to sites of the Folsom complex visitors to the region. East of
the Edwards Plateau, in the Cross Timbers region and farther east,
their sites may be so ephemeral as to be represented by nothing more
than isolated finds. The potentially broader based, woodland adapted,
eastern Paleoindian tradition might be expected to leave larger sites
with more complex tool assemblages than contemporary Folsom sites on
the Edwards Plateau to the west.
A point made by Skinner concerning the frequency of exotic stone
raw material resources is particularly adaptable to this model.
Plains adapted cultures such as Folsom and Plano would be much more
I ikely to introduce exotic raw materials from the western United
States and vice versa for the eastern Paleoindian tradition. Assuming

44-6

CULTURE HISTORY
that the home ranges of the woodland peoples were smaller and the
avai labi I ity of adequate chert raw material somewhat poorer to the
east, one might hypothesize that Brazos Fishtai I type projectile
points would be more I ikely to be made from Central Texas cherts than
other contemporaneous western Paleoindian projectile point styles.
Concomitantly, the possible shrinking range of Plano peoples might be
investigated by comparing raw material uti I ization between Folsom and
Plainview points.
Because of the miniscule sample size, it is difficult to draw
many conclusions regarding the Paleoindian occupation of the Aqui I la
Lake area. The two sites with recorded Paleoindian components are
quite
different.
Site 41HI189, which yielded the tentatively
identified Brazos Fishtai I specimen, is described as smal I with
sparsely scattered material. Only ten items were collected from the
site in 1972, including seven flakes and chips, a core, a scraper and
the projectile point noted above (SMU collection records). The 1975
survey report observed between 10 and 24 pieces of I ithic debris and
one bi face, apparently not collected. The Sul I ivan Site, on the other
hand, is a large multicomponent site that has yielded a vast number of
diagnostic projectile points 1n addition to I ithic debitage (see
Chapter 33).
These sites have at least two traits in common - their location
on Aqui I la Creek and on alluvial terraces above the modern floodplain.
The first factor, location on Aqui I la Creek, may be sampling error.
There is I ittle evidence that Paleoindian hunters preferred Aqui I la to
Hackberry Creek as a territorial base, although Aqui I la Creek is
within the Cross Timbers while Hackberry flows primarily through the
Black land Prairie.
The second similarity, location on alluvial
terraces, is partly conditioned by geomorphic factors. Given the
relatively recent Archaic material found buried at depths approaching
four meters in the McDonald Site, it is extremely uni ikely that in
situ Paleoindian materials would be recovered from sites on the modern
floodplain.
There seems to be no good reason, however, for the lack
of Paleoindian material in upland areas and this may be a function of
sampling error.
Despite the fact that both sites are on alluvial terraces, there
1s little geomorphic similarity in their locations. Site 41HI189 is
on the edge of a broad expanse of Pleistocene terrace that separates
the two major creeks.
Ritchie and Slaughter (1972) have suggested
that this terrace is of Sangamon age. While this age determination is
supported only on the basis of comparison to similar terrace forms in
other drainages, there seems I ittle doubt that the deposition of this
landform predates human occupation of the region. On the other hand,
the low terrace containing much of the cultural materials at the
Sul I ivan Site may be late Pleistocene or even early Holocene in age,

if its height above the modern floodplain

CULTURE HISTORY

EARLY ARCHAIC PERIOD
Prewitt (1981) has divided the Early Archaic into four named
phases (see Chapter 7). Since there is I ittle clear definition of the
East and North Central Texas Archaic adaptations, Prewitt's phases are
used here strictly for comparative purposes. This should not be taken
as an indication that Early Archaic adaptations in the Aqui I la Lake
area were exactly para I lei to those further south and west in Central
Texas. They may be identical, but the evidence gathered so far is
I imited.
Sites of the Early Archaic Period in the Aqui I la Lake area
are shown in Figure 44.2.
Three sites in the Aqui I la Lake area have yielded projectile
point types regarded by Prewitt as key index markers of his earliest
Archaic phase, Circlevi I le, dated between 8500 and 7000 B.P. (Prewitt
1981:75-76). Points from these sites include two Angostura specimens,
one from 41Hl146 (x41Hl97) and the other from 41Hlll0 (x41Hl85), and a
probable reworked Plainview (or other lanceolate) from 41Hl75 (Brazi I
Site - x41HI72). The latter is the only early lanceolate specimen
from an excavated context in the Aqui I la Lake area.
In addition, there are several Angostura and Meserve specimens as
wel I as possible Golondrina and Scottsbluff types in the landowner's
collection from the Sul I ivan Site (41Hlll7). Although only a few of
the projectile points in this large collection have been identified,
there are more than a dozen lanceolate projectile point bases with
ground edges
even more if dri I Is made on lanceolate bases were
counted. Most of these probably date to either the Paleoindian Period
or the Circlevi I le phase of the Early Archaic.
This period, which has previously been
defined
as
Late
Pa Ieo ind i an
or
Pre-Archaic
(So 11 berger
and Hester 1972), 1s
characterized by most authors (Sol I berger and Hester 1972;
Prewitt
1981) as the earliest emergence of many of the traits characteristic
of the Archaic adaptation (broadening of the subsistence base,
regional cultural differentiation) superimposed upon a continuation of
the distinctive Paleoindian style I ithic technology.
The conflicts
over nomenclature (Prewitt 1981) are primarily centered around the
question of just how Archaic is it? The relatively few sites of this
period that have been thoroughly excavated and published in Texas may
sti 11 leave room for further discussion of this issue.
Very little can be said in characterizing the Aqui I la area as a
specific region during this period.
Most of the Central Texas
Circlevi I le phase key index marker projectile points are widely spread

throughout Texas and surrounding states. Angostura or Angostura-like
points are found from the High Plains to the Rio Grande (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:167), extending eastward into East Texas and Louisiana
(Gagliano and Gregory 1965:72).
Extensive variation exists within
this type and it seems I ikely that several different types may be
represented (Kelly 1982), not al I of
which
are
necessarily
contemporaneous.
Golondrina specimens, initially defined as a variant of the
Plainview type at the Devi I's Mouth Site (Johnson 1964:46-52), are
I ikewise widely distributed, particularly in South and West Texas.
The few tentative specimens from Aqui I la are less distinctive formally
than many others observed by the author from South and West Texas,
with only a hint of recurve at the base rather than protruding "ears",
and with perhaps a less narrowly incurved waist. While the specimens
Aqui I la
Lake might fit within Johnson's (1964) original
from
definition, they do not fit wel I within Kelly's (1983) recent
reassessment of the type.
The distribution of Meserve points presents somewhat of a
problem, as does their temporal placement. It has long been suggested
that at least some of the specimens may be reworked Plainview (see
Suhm, Krieger and Jelks 1954:450), while others may have been
intentionally manufactured with sharp triangular blades above the
lanceolate base.
Myers and Lambert (1983) have argued that the
resharpening of Meserve points in the central Great Plains is an
important diagnostic feature and should probably be considered a
coeval development with Dalton. Goodyear, who has studied the Dalton
resharpening technology (Goodyear 1974), had previously expressed
skepticism of the validity of the Meserve type (Goodyear 1982).
If
Meserve specimens are truly contemporaneous with Dalton, they are
probably earlier than Prewitt's (1981) Circlevi I le phase.
The only
possible Meserve point, from the Brazi I Site, is felt to be a reworked
lanceolate apparently associated with a San Geronimo phase diagnostic
Gower point rather than Circlevi I le materials.
The distribution of Circlevi I le phase projectile points in the
Aqui I la Lake area shows some variability. Three sites yielding these
styles are located on Aqui I la Creek while a fourth is on the east bank
of Hackberry Creek. The reworked Plainview specimen from the Brazi I
Site may be the earliest projectile point from a site reportedly
located on the modern floodplain. Although the site extends from the
modern floodplain up onto an older terrace remnant and even onto the
slopes of an upland finger ridge, this point, found in Unit 22, is
from an area identified as the floodplain (see Chapter 31 on the
Brazi I Site). The depth of the specimen - 60 to 70 centimeters, seems
unusually shallow when compared to the floodplain chronological
44-10

CULTURE HISTORY
sequence from the McDonald Site, an almost identical distance above
the confluence of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks.
Although this
specimen may have been picked up and brought into a later campsite,
other specimens suggest an Early Archaic date for at least the lower
portion of this unit.
Several factors may be responsible for the
apparent disparity in sedimentation rates between the two para I lei
sites.
One is that the portion of the Brazi I Site under discussion
(west of the apparent abandoned channel trenched by backhoe trenches E
and F) may not be part of the modern floodplain but a low terrace
similar to the one at the Sul I ivan Site. Actually, there is a slight
rise west of the old channel that could be a low terrace remnant (see
Fig. 31.1). The soi Is described from Unit 22 in Fig. 31.4) are not
similar to the description given by the Soi I Conservation Service for
a typical pedon of Pursley clay loam; the floodplain soil mapped at
the edge of the site (Brooks 1978:67-8). The Unit 22 description
matches more closely the SCS description for a typical pedon of
Si lstid loamy fine sand, the soil actually mapped in the area of Unit
22. Table 44.1 below shows a comparison of the colors and textures
for these three soi Is. Unfortunately, the Si lstid series is listed as
forming in upland areas (Brooks 1978:68-9), an uni ikely or1g1n for
this landform.
Although this author feels that there is good evidence that the
smal I rise on which Unit 22 is located is probably a low terrace
remnant, it is not impossible that it is modern floodplain.
Several
sedimentary factors might account for the difference in depositional
rates between the two para I lei areas. One of the more important is
probably the difference in sedimentary source areas for the two major
creeks. Hackberry Creek flows through primarily clayey Eagle Ford
Group sediments, while Aqui I la Creek flows through Woodbine Formation
sands. Given two streams with flow rates around the same order of
magnitude
(an
unproven assumption), depositional rates may be
different between sand and clay. In addition, hydraulic properties of
the surrounding topography are somewhat different. The McDonald Site
I ies near the western edge of a narrow band of floodplain that extends
upstream for some distance above the site. This band of alluvial
sediments is the upper end of a large area of floodplain deposited
upstream from the confluence of the two major creeks as a result of
water backing up in this area. The Brazi I Site, on the other hand,
lies on the downstream edge of a long, low finger ridge that extends
out into a relatively wide expanse of floodplain. This ridge acts as
a choke, forcing deposition of sediments upstream from the Brazi I
Site, where several buried sites have been observed on the modern
floodplain, and is almost certain to cause turbulent flows in the site
area.

CULTURE HISTORY

One of the two Angostura specimens from the project area 1s the
only
confirmed
occurrence
of a Paleoindian or Early Archaic
Circlevi I le projectile point style from an upland area.
This basal
fragment, which is too smal I to permit anything but a tentative
identification, was recovered from the surface of a sandy upland area
near Aqui I la Creek during the Management Data Survey. No other
diagnostics have been recovered from this site (41HI146).
The other
Angostura specimen, also a base, but larger and more certainly
identified than the previous specimen, was recovered from 41Hl110
during the 1972 survey. Since this site extends from the upland slope
down onto a fossi I terrace of Hackberry Creek, it is not possible to
state the exact nature of the landform on which it was found.
Al I of the sites with Circlevi I le phase diagnostics from within
the Aqui I la Lake area have yielded diagnostic projectile points from a
number of cultural phases, and al I are large multicomponent sites.
Only one, the Brazi I Site, may have a stratigraphical ly separated,
buried, and perhaps relatively intact, Circlevi I le component.
Little
can be said, therefore, about the Circlevi I le occupation of the area,
except perhaps, that the occurrence of these projectile points in
sites reoccupied many times during later Archaic phases does not
appear to support the presence of any unique adaptive strategy during
this phase.
Prewitt's (1981) next phase, the San Geronimo, slightly modified
the one proposed previously by Weir (1976), seems under
from
represented in the Aqui I la Lake area, but this may be a function of
difficulties in identification of the diagnostic projectile point
styles. Only one site yielded projectile points that can be assigned
to this period with any degree of confidence. One specimen, a Wei Is
point (Suhm and Jelks 1962:257-258), was recovered from level 4 of
Unit 5 at the Brazi I Site. This fragmentary specimen has a long, wel I

shoulders.
Despite its square stemmed base, it fits wel I within the
definition of this type.
Two other long contracting stem forms
recovered from the area may be examples of the Wei Is type or preforms
for that type. The better made of these two is a fragmentary specimen
from the Reps Davis Site (41HI58 - x41HI40). The stem edges are not,
or are onJy very slightly, ground and the workmanship is inferior to
many other specimens of this type. Also, it was found within the
context of a Late Archaic and/or Late Prehistoric campsite buried in
the modern floodplain.
It has been identified elsewhere here as a
probable Gary specimen, and, given the context, this may be the case.
The other tentative Wei Is specimen, also a basal-medial fragment, was
collected from the surface of 41HI169 (x41HI166) during the Management
Data Survey.
This crude patinated specimen may represent a Wei Is
point preform, abandoned during the manufacturing process.
Besides
44-13

CULTURE HISTORY
these three specimens, there are several possible Wei Is points present
in the landowner collection from the Sul I ivan Site, but
this
identification is tentative, made only from photographs.
One tentatively identified Gower projectile point is also present
in the collection from the Brazi I Site (41HI75). It apparently has
been resharpened and has a pronounced bevel (actually a twist) on the
right side. One other questionable specimen may date to this period.
A stem and portion of the blade of a smal I Dari-I ike projectile point
from the Bailey Site (41HI77 - x41HI99) might be an example of what
Prewitt (1974, 1982) has termed the Hoxie point. This specimen has a
very slightly expanding stem with a concave base and wel I ground stem
edges. Its blade has been resharpened, resulting in very steep blade
edges and slight projections at the shoulders, like those described by
Prewitt (1982) for the Zephyr point.
It is not clear if the lack of diagnostic projectile points from
this period is a function of some cultural phenomenon, as in a reduced
uti I ization of the area or the development of some unrecognized local
tradition, or some methodological phenomenon such as sampling error or
difficulties in identification of the key index markers.
Although
Wei Is points are distinctive, there may be some difficulties in
separating them from longer stemmed Gary specimens.
Gower points,
usually distinct enough, can occasionally be difficult to separate
from smal I ground stem versions of the Pedernales style, as wel I as,
in this case, only slightly expanding stem versions of the Uvalde
style. Out of dated context, single specimens of Hoxie projectile
points may be difficult to separate from other Dari-I ike types. The
combination of these difficulties with the genera~smal I sample of
al I Early Archaic and Paleoindian projectile points does not give much
credence to any statements concerning cultural trends during this
period.
No projectile points can be unquestionably assigned to either of
the succeeding two phases of Prewitt's (1981) chronology.

specimen from the McDonald Site, identified there as Bulverde-I ike, is

Despite this Early Archaic identification, the specimen was recovered
from the Late Prehistoric levels at the McDonald Site and is obviously
out of context. It is possible that this specimen was picked up at a
site some distance from the lake area. Besides this specimen, three
possible Martindale projectile points have been collected from sites
in the Aqui I la Lake vicinity. These are from 41HI110, 41HI156 and

Unfortunately, both shoulders and a large part of the
distal portion of the stem are broken. The only complete specimen,
previously suggested as a possible Martindale in Lynott and Peter
(1977:89 92) has an less distinct double recurve base and a narrower
blade than any of those i I lustrated by Suhm and Jelks. The third
specimen, from 41HI156 (the procurement/workshop site immediately
above 41HI112), is technologically similar to the other two, but part
of the stem base has broken off precluding definite identification.
One long barbed specimen in the landowner collection from the Sul I ivan
Site may be a Bel I point. Although some triangular knives have been
collected fro~he Aqui I la region, none recovered from the project
area or observed in private collections appear to correspond to either
of the triangular Baird or Taylor forms identified by Prewitt (1981)
as key index markers of the Oakal la phase.

In summary, nearly al I of the diagnostics thought to represent
the Early Archaic in Central Texas are dated to the Circlevi I le phase.
Although the sample is
extremely
smal I,
several
alternative
explanations might be proposed.
One is that a decrease in local
population occurred after the local equivalent of the Circlevi I le,
either concordant with a larger regional population decrease or
perhaps
reflecting
only
less
frequent
use
of
the
Cross
Timbers-Blackland Prairie ecotone by peoples with a much larger
territorial range. Another viable alternative might be related to
changes 1n territorial range subsequent to the Circlevi I le phase.
This latter suggestion appears to have some merit.
The distribution
of these early projectile point styles suggests that the Circlevi I le
types are distributed widely, wel I beyond the defined range of Central
Texas.
Many of these types occur southward from the Great Plains,
extending at least as far south as the Lower Pecos, through Central
Texas into the southeastern United States (see Gag I iano and Gregory
1965). One of the factors which Sol I berger and Hester (1972) propose
as distinguishing the Pre-Archaic from the Archaic is the wide
distribution of the related forms and Prewitt (1981:77) describes it
as a "regional expression of a widespread adaptation". Subsequent
Early Archaic phases, however, appear to have had a more restricted
distribution, being more closely localized within the Central Texas
region (Prewitt 1981).
Although it might be tempting to suggest, on the basis of these
statements, that subsequent to the Circlevi I le phase, the Aqui I la Lake
area was only marginally a participant in the Central Texas cultural
tradition, the earliest Archaic phases of surrounding areas to the
north and east are sti I I too poorly known to suggest a substitute.
Delineation of such a boundary is made difficult by the wider
distributions of some of the projectile points during these later
Early Archaic phases. It is interesting that the few specimens from
Aqui I la Lake that date to this period are among the more widespread.
44-15

CULTURE HISTORY
The Wei Is type, for example, commonly occurs in East Texas (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:257) and both Bel I and Andice points may be related to the
more widely distributed--cilf Creek projectile point (Prewitt 1981).
The most convincing of the-<>ther post-Circlevi I le specimens, the
possible Gower from the Brazi I Site, also shares some similarities
with the early bifurcated stem tradition of the central plains and
southeast.
MIDDLE ARCHAIC PERIOD
Prewitt (1981) has divided the Central Texas Middle Archaic into
four named phases, Clear Fork, Marshal I Ford, Round Rock and San
Marcos, lasting as a whole from about 4600 to 2250 years B.P.
Comparison of the Central Texas data with that from Aqui I la Lake
yields one immediate and striking difference. Burned rock middens, a
diagnostic feature of the Middle Archaic, have not been recorded from
Aqui I la Lake or the surrounding area. While these highly recognizable
site types occur with considerable frequency south and west of the
Aqui I la region, the best known midden east of the Brazos in the
general area is the Ham Creek Site in Johnson County. Although the
overal I projectile point assemblage from this site is distinct from
the typical Central Texas burned rock midden assemblage (Prewitt
1974), there are a number of Pedernales and Castrovi I le types, both
associated with the burned rock midden sites of the Central Texas
Middle Archaic. Figure 44.3 shows the Middle Archaic Period sites 1n
the lake area.
None of the sites in the project area have yielded an example of
the easily identifiable, beveled stem Nolan projectile point, dated by
Prewitt to the Clear Fork phase of the Middle Archaic.
Likewise,
although a few crude stemmed specimens from the project collection and
from the H.D. Sul I ivan private collection may be
related,
no
unquestionable Travis
points
have
been identified.
Bulverde
specimens, on the other hand, are undoubtedly present. Unfortunately,
the identification of Bulverde points is rendered difficult by the
plethora of para I lel sided, stemmed points found in the area. Some of
these, such as Carrol Iton or Dawson types, may be contemporaneous with
Bulverde, while other forms are certainly later in time. None of the
specimens can be considered classic Bulverde forms, with large
triangular blades and wel I made wedge shaped bases.
Most of the
specimens fal I ing within the Bulverde range would also fit nicely
within the range of the Carrol Iton type. It may be that both of these
projectile point styles are extremes of variation of the same
contemporaneous form in the Aqui I la Lake area. Two projectile points
collected by SMU, one from the Aldridge Site (41HI195) and the other
from 41HI128 (x41HI112), come closest to the definition of the
Bulverde type (Suhm and Jelks 1962:169-170) and are considered such

here. Two other specimens, one from the SMU investigations at the
Bailey Site (41HI77) and the other from the 1980 TAS collection at
41HI110, have some Bulverde/Carrollton characteristics but cannot
easily be separated into one or the other type. Yet another specimen,
collected by SMU from the surface of 41HI130 (x41HI102), could be
included here as a Bulverde/Carrol Iton example. Although the only
date on Carrol Iton focus materials (6000 B.P.- Crook and Harris 1952,
1954) seems too early to be contemporaneous with the Central Texas
Bulverde point, dated between 4000 and 3400 B.P. (Prewitt 1981), many
specimens
are
similar
enough
sty I istical ly
to suggest some
relationship, be it contemporaneous or developmental.
Skinner et
al. (1978:180), 1n developing a projectile point chronology for the
Aqui I la Lake region, suggest
that
the
Carrol I ton
point
is
contemporaneous with the Pedernales type, fol lowing the Bulverde in
time. Their evidence for this temporal assignment, however, 1s not
given.
On the whole, then, it becomes difficult to say anything about
the early portion of the Middle Archaic, with the apparent absence of
the recognizable Travis and Nolan projectile point styles and the
questionable
contemporaneity
of
the
local equivalent of the
Carrol I ton/Bulverde style. It is suggested here that this evidence,
in conjunction with the lack of the key site type, the burned rock
midden, in the area, suggests lowered use of this region by Central
Texas peoples during the early Middle Archaic. While there is little
good stratigraphic evidence for a North Central Texas chronological
sequence, observation of the projectile point types listed for the
Carrol Iton focus (Crook and Harris 1952:15) shows a number of types
common in Central Texas during the Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic.
Although several possible Travis specimens are i I lustrated here (Crook
and Harris 1952:nos. 1 & 4), the only others resembling Middle Archaic
types are the Carrollton specimens (Crook and Harris 1952:nos. 7 - 9).
Despite the resemblance, it seems that these are not simply Bulverde
points under a different name. Examination of Carrol Iton specimens in
the TARL collection and from the Aqui Ila Lake area shows that they are
consistently smaller~ as befits the typically smaller stone resources
of the region, unbarbed and with bases that are formally but not
always, technologically similar to their Central Texas cousins.
If the early Middle Archaic is difficult to pin down in the
Aqui I la Lake area, the later Middle Archaic becomes even more so. The
single diagno7tic projectile point of the Round Rock phase, the
Pedernales, 1s present, but, as with the earlier Bulverde, in a
variant form and in diminished numbers.
The classic Central Texas
style, large bladed Pedernales point with a deeply indented concave
base is not present. Several of the larger and heavier dart points
from
surface collections 1n the area seem relatively securely
44-18

CULTURE HISTORY
identified as representative of this type.
These include
two
specimens
from
41HI110
and one from 41HI170.
Smaller, less
conclusively identified specimens were collected from the Bailey Site
(41HI77), 41HI174 and 41HI177. Another questionable Pedernales point
was recovered from Level 32 of the deep excavation unit in Area B at
the McDonald Site (41HI105). The similarities between this crudely
chipped, narrow bladed specimen and the Pedernales
type
were
considered fortuitous unti I a radiocarbon date for charcoal from this
level provided an uncorrected date of 2850 + 40 years 8.P., securely
within Prewitt>s (1981) Round Rock phase (3400 to 2600 B.P.).
While the similarities in form suggest some contact with the
Central Texas area, the differences in projectile point morphology are
intriguing. One possibi I ity is that the differences in materials
avai I able, between Cretaceous I imestone chert and Uvalde gravels, may
account for al I of the morphological differences.
The two largest
specimens collected here are both most similar in form to Central
Texas specimens and both are possibly manufactured from Central Texas
cherts.
If such is the case, it might suggest that Central Texas peoples
were uti I izing the area during the Round Rock phase. If this is so,
the absence of burned rock middens must be explained.
Although the
areal distribution of whatever resource was being prepared at the
midden sites can be invoked here, there are several other factors
which are easier to document. One is the almost complete absence of
available I imestone in the Aquil la Lake area. Only the thin beds of
the Buda I imestone outcropping along the valley wal I on the eastern
side of the lake, where 41HI110, the only site in the lake area with
two Pedernales points, is located, provide any carbonate stone
resource, apparently a critical factor in the formation of the
middens.
Evidence from the McDonald Site, where the Pedernales
equivalent stratum is buried more than three meters beneath the
surface of the floodplain, suggests that if such sites did exist on
the floodplain at that time, they may now be deeply buried, or were
destroyed by subsequent alluvial action.
There is no evidence that such is the case, but examination of
artifact collections from the north and east of Aqui I la Lake reveals
an almost total absence of Pedernales points, indicating that these
are not linked to any known cultural tradition from these areas. Not
knowing what particular projectile point style might have been
uti I ized in those areas during this period of time, it is difficult to
state the intensity of contact with or use by Central Texas peoples as
opposed to these other areas.

44-19

CULTURE HISTORY
The last phase of Prewitt 1 s (1981) rev1s1on of the Central Texas
chronology, the San Marcos, is probably less wel I represented than
either of the previous two. The key index markers, Marshal I, Lange
and Wi I Iiams projectile points, are not common in the Central Brazos
region. Broad stemmed, unbarbed projectile points which may be
related to the latter two types are found occasionally in the area,
and are dated to the Middle Archaic Period at Bear Creek Shelter
(Lynott 1978:84). Several projectile points with wel I made, para I lel
sided, concave stems from the Aqui I la area may be Marshal I points or a
contemporary variant.
Unfortunately none are whole and most are
represented only by stems.
Only one specimen, found at 41Hl163
(x41HI142), the terrace remnant mownd northwest of the McKenzie Site,
can be convincingly classed as a Marshal I type. A few specimens from
the area have slightly expanding, straight based, broad stems in the
manner of both Wi I Iiams and Lange but cannot be typed as either of
these styles. Nonetheless, these are regarded here as contemporaneous
with the transition from the Middle to the Late Archaic.
These
include specimens from the Bailey Site (41HI77), the Aldridge Site
(41Hl195 - 3 specimens), another from 41Hl163, northwest of the
McKenzie Site, and one from 41HI161, northeast of the Rowe Site and
less than a kilometer west of 41HI163.
The recovery of so many
similar specimens from a I imited area is interesting. Three of the
projectile points are from the same site on the uplands, just above
the confluence of Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks, and al I but one of the
rema1n1ng specimens are from terrace remnant or upland sites within a
kilometer
radius on upper Hackberry Creek.
This may indicate
intensive reuse of particular campsite areas during this phase.
As
with the Round Rock phase specimens, there is a probable geomorphic
explanation for the lack of specimens at floodplain sites; they would
be buried too deeply to be detected. However, three of the four sites
are located on high upland ridges close to the creek, possibly a
favored location during this time. The fourth, 41Hl163, is not as
high, but is certainly a prominent rise and may have been located
immediately on the creek if the channel which flows north of the
McKenzie Site was active at that time.
One of the uncorrected radiocarbon dates from the deep excavation
unit at the McDonald Site fal Is within this period. This date, 2610 +
40 years B.P., is associated closely with what has been classified
here as a Castrovi I le projectile point because of its broad base and
asymmetrical long barbs. Prewitt (1981:76), however, has included
this type as a key index marker of the succeeding Late Archaic Uvalde
phase. It may be that this particular specimen (Fig. 38.15b) is
misidentified;
its base is at the narrowest end of the type range.
On the other hand, it may be that this type is earlier in this area,
and perhaps diffused southward from here. The single radiocarbon date
may also be anomalous. In any case, it is interesting to note that a
very similar, .broad based, crude specimen (preform?) was recovered

from the Aldridge Site, which has also yielded

three

other

possible

Skinner et al. (1978) have suggested that the Early and Middle
Archaic periods were essentially a continuation of the trend toward
group segmentation and regional differentiation associated with a
general drying trend of the Holocene. They suggest an increasing
population, placing greater emphasis on exploitation of specific
resources. As they put it:
... populations
were
not
only
adapting
to
smaller
exploitative ranges than previously uti I ized, but were
moving throughout a number of these areas toward the
systematic exploitation of specific resource localities
where resource sets occurred with abundance, required little
extraction energy, and yielded comparatively high levels of
energy (Skinner et al. 1978).
There is good evidence that a number of Middle Archaic sites may
be buried in the creek floodplains and/or first terraces. Despite
this, there seems to be numerical support, 1n terms of diagnostic
artifacts, for a slight population increase during this period.
Although the evidence is based on a meager sample, the sense of
shifting cultural boundaries and perhaps even regional differentiation
begins to be evident. This is indicated by the apparent increased
distinction of Central Brazos projectile point types from the classic
Central Texas types. Many types are not present.
Carrollton-like
attributes prevai I over Bulverde attributes.
Pedernales points,
generally rare, are smal I with less distinctive basal notching than is
common in Central Texas.
Although the increasing cultural distance to Central Texas can be
documented, it is difficult to assess potential ties to other regions,
particularly because of the lack of wel I dated stratigraphic sequences
to the north and east.
If an areal sphere of influence had to be
defined for the Middle Archaic, it would probably extend immediately
to the east into Limestone and Navarro counties and north toward
Dal las. The abundance of straight stemmed points, at least some of
which might be typed as Dawson, may I ink these regions. Straight
stemmed specimens appear to decrease in frequency further to the east
and northeast.
Analysis of the Middle Archaic site locations shows a broader
distribution of physiographic locales, with sites occurring in almost
every microenvironment. This apparent expansion of habitats from
previous periods is almost certainly a function of expanded sample
size. It does not, however, appear to support the exploitation of a
single resource, but rather suggests a wide ranging adaptation.

44-21

CULTURE HISTORY
LATE ARCHAIC PERIOD
While the transition between the Middle and Late Archaic in
Central Texas is marked by the decline of burned rock midden formation
(Prewitt 1981), there is no such clear boundary in the Aqui Ila Lake
area. What seems to set off the Late Archaic in the project area is a
gradual diminution in projectile point size, particularly stem width,
and, as Skinner et al. (1978) have suggested, an increased population.
The evidence gathered to date is not sufficient to indicate any
differences in settlement patterns or exploitative strategies. The
Late Archaic sites of the Aqui I la Lake area are shown in Figure 44.4.
The initial phase of Prewitt>s (1981) Central Texas Late Archaic
is the Uvalde, dated from 2250 to 1750 years B.P. Diagnostic
projectile points, identified by Prewitt as Marcos, Monte I I and
Castrovi I le types, occur in the Aqui I la Lake area, but in modified
form. As with most of the Aqui I la specimens I inked with point types
from other areas, these specimens are generally smaller. This is such
a common phenomenon here that it is thought to be a function of the
size of I ithic raw materials available. Although the apparent use of
local chert suggests prolonged use of the local resources, it is the
paucity of Central Texas chert projectile point specimens which makes
the most striking statement about the areal range of the inhabitants
of the Aquil la Lake area.
Despite this, the similarity in point
styles throughout much of the Archaic suggests that there must have
been some cultural exchange.
While the Uvalde phase in the Aqui I la Lake area seems to be
represented by diminutive and occasionally poorly crafted versions of
the diagnostic projectile points found in Central Texas proper, the
succeeding Twin Sisters phase is even more poorly represented. Only
one crude side notched specimen bears any resemblance to the Ensor
type, one of the key index markers of this period (Prewitt 1981).
This projectile point and another crude side notched specimen,
tentatively typed here as a Trinity point, are the only side notched
points from the project area. Interestingly, they are both from the
Brazi I Site (41HI75). As Prewitt points out, Ensor points are widely
distributed beyond Central Texas, so their near absence in the Aqui I la
area raises some questions.
While they are not extremely common
anywhere, they should occur with more frequency here. Examination of
various artifact collections from east and north of the study area
suggest that Ensor points are generally more rare in East Texas than
in Central Texas.
The influence of cultures north and east of the Aqui Ila area
becomes
most
apparent during the Late Archaic.
Although not
specifically associated with any of Prewitt's Central Texas phases,
the Gary point, thought to be a Late Archaic diagnostic, becomes the

Altogether, 34 of 178 projectile points in the Aqui I la Lake project
collection are contracting stem types. Most of these could be typed
as Gary. Sixteen sites in the lake area have one or more Gary points
present.
Although the dating of Â¥ary points is not firmly fixed, evidence
exas and Louisiana suggest that the type
from sites in Oklahoma,
extends into the Late Woodland or Early Ceramic period.
The gradual
replacement of expanding stem projectile point forms by contracting
stem forms, such as the Gary, is a trend that has been long noted in
the southeastern United States. Wheat demonstrated this at Addicks
Reservoir, noting the association of Gary with the earliest ceramic

association of this form with early ceramic cultures in the southeast
and
Woodland
cultures
of
the
central United States (Wheat
1953:204-205).
In defining the La Harpe aspect of the East Texas Archaic,
Johnson (1962) noted the association of Garb points with the late
phase. At the Yarbrough and Mi Iler sites in
elta and Van Zandt
counties, Gary points predominate, being the most common style at
either site. A total of 119 of the 144 dart points (92.2%) from the
Manton Mi Iler Site were typed as Gary (Johnson 1962:244). At the
earlier Fred Yarbrough Site, 548 of 1022 dart points (53.6%) are Gary
points.
At similar Late Archaic and early ceramic sites throughout
east and northeast Texas, Gary points are common. At the Glen Hi I I
Site in Rockwal I County, they comprise 64.6% of al I dart points (Ross
1966), and they make up 44.3% of the dart points from the Pecan
Springs Site in Ellis County (Sorrow 1965).
Along the western periphery of East Texas, the Gary type is sti I I
common, but rarely approaching the percentages often encountered
further to the north and east. In the original Lake Limestone survey,
only 16.4 percent were identified as Gary types, but contracting stem
forms are dominant here also, comprising approximately half of al I
dart points (Prewitt 1974).
Later excavations at Lake Limestone
(Mal louf 1979) recovered similar percentages of Gary points (18.9%).
At the Strawn Creek Site in Navarro County, Duffield (1963) identified
only 10 (13.3%) of the 75 dart points as Gary, but eight other
contracting stem forms were not typed.
Sites along the Brazos River, on the other hand, show relatively
few contracting stem forms. The Baylor Site in Mclennan County, with
five Gary points out of 43 dart points (11.6%), has one of the largest
~ components
(Story and Shafer 1965).

Brazos sites that approaches this percentage is the Ham Creek Site

of the sample. A brief inspection of artifact collections from many
other Central Brazos sites shows the near absence of this style along
the Brazos and westward. Several reservoir studies in this area have
recovered miniscule numbers of this type. One specimen was recovered
from Lake Belton (Shafer, Suhm and Scurlock 1964), none from the
Sti I I house Hollow excavations (Sorrow, Shafer and Ross 1967) and only
a handful from test excavations at Lake Whitney (Stephenson 1970).
Despite the fact that the sites from Lake Whitney yielded a
number of Late Archaic styles (Ensor - 17.4%; Dari - 8%), only six
Gary points (3.3%) were recovered out of 178 total dart points
reported.
This collection is a marked contrast to the Aqui I la Lake
project collection where, only 20 miles east, 34 of 180 specimens
(18.9%) are contracting stem, almost al I of these Gary variants.
Recognizing the dangers of archeological sampling as
well
as
projectile point typology, it is nonetheless suggested here that at
times during the Late Archaic, Aqui I la Creek was on the cultural
frontier of east and northeast Texas.
The prevalence of Gary points in the Aqui I la Lake area opens the
way for an interesting question: is there an early ceramic, pre-Caddo
period at Aqui I la Lake? Irvine (1983) has suggested that plainwares
from the Richard Creek area may be related to Wi I Iiams Plain, an early
ceramic type found 1n Oklahoma, northeast Texas and occasionally
Louisiana.
With the exception of a few thick bone tempered sherds
from 41HI111 however, nothing from the Aqui I la Lake area can be
convincingly related to Wi I Iiams Plain.
However, the sherds from
41HI111 do not have the coarse grog which is characteristic of this
type in other areas. If the cultures associated with Gary points were
making ceramics in the Central Brazos region, it does not stand out
archeological ly. The probabi I ity that Aqui I la Creek was a boundary of
this projectile point type is consistent with the idea that the
centers of pottery production would not have been on the fringe of the
culture area.
Despite the lack of dates for the Gary points from the Aqui I la
Lake project area, it is probably a Late Archaic style. Whether it
lasted throughout this period, or whether it replaced the missing Twin
Sister phase cannot be determined.
There is some evidence that,
during the succeeding Driftwood phase in Central Texas (Prewitt 1981),
a resurgence of Central Texas influence in the Aqui Ila Lake area
occurred. One Dari point was collected from level 17 of the deep 1982
test pit at the McDonald Site, five to six levels before the apparent
advent of the Late Prehistoric. Another Dari was collected from the
Pilgrim Site (41HI124), while four Dari-I ike specimens were recovered
from the Brazi I Site (41HI75). Yet another was recovered from 41HI130
on Aqui I la Creek.
Several other smal I stemmed points from the area

may also be referred to this period,

CULTURE HISTORY

An important, yet sti I I unresolved, question regarding the
Transitional Archaic in the Central Brazos is the relationship of
~points
to other Transitional Archaic point types.
Jelks
(1962:86) associates the Godley type with the Austin focus, while
Forrester (1964) suggested that they may be earlier.
Excavations at
the Baylor and Britton sites (Story and Shafer 1965:132-135) seemed to
s~ggest that Dari, Ensor, Godley and perhaps even
Gary were roughly
contemporaneous
and
may have survived into the Austin phase.
Unfortunately, I ittle stratigraphic excavation has been done in the
region since that which might help clarify this question.
A number of Godley points have been recovered from the Aqui Ila
Lake area.
One specimen, from the 1978 excavations in Area A at the
McDonald Site, was found underlying Late Prehistoric Toyah phase
materials.
This specimen should be younger than the Dari point
recovered from Area B, but relative ages are difficult to establish
here.
Other Godley specimens were recovered from 41HI109, 41Hll10,
41HI75, 41HI157, x41HI150 and x41HI159.
During the Late Archaic there is a dramatic increase in the
number of sites, a possible indicator of increased population during
this period as alluded to by Skinner et al. (1978). Another seeming
trend during this period is the pro I iferation of point styles and
rather extreme variation among specimens of a given type. Gary points
from the reservoir, for example, can be divided into 10 or so groups,
several of which are distinct. These variations may indicate use of
the area by a number of separate bands. Whether or not this indicates
increasing fragmentation of groups is uncertain. In any case, these
suggestions seem to run counter to the suggestion by Skinner et al.
(ms.) that this is a period of settling into the local environment.
Despite the increased sample of sites from this period, it 1s
difficult
to
make
broad
generalizations
concerning resource
procurement strategies. The best approximation, however, may be one
of a broadening niche, of expanding resource diversification. Perhaps
during this period the brief mesic interlude reported by Baker and
Penteado-Orel lana (1977) comes to an end, with diversification a
response to a gradually drying environment.
Because of the difficulties encountered in
attempting
to
accurately characterize the Middle and Late Archaic diagnostics of
North Central and East Texas, it is not possible to quantify any
increases in influence from these areas at this time. Subjectively,
the northern and eastern influence seems to increase through time. At
any rate, wel I before the supposed Caddo intrusions into the area
during the Late Prehistoric, Aqui I la Lake and the Central Brazos area

had established strong ties to the north and east.

CULTURE HISTORY

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
The Late Prehistoric of the Aqui I la Lake area is commonly divided
into Austin and Toyah, after Jelks' (1962) revised separation of the
two. phases. Both phases have been discussed by Prewitt (1981) as
part of his Neoarchaic Stage. Arrow points collected from the Aqui I la
Lake area suggest that both are present, though perhaps not 1n equal
proportions. Sites of both phases are shown in Figure 44.5.
Seal lorn points, a key index marker of the Austin phase, are
present at the McDonald Site (41HI105) but there does not appear to be
clear stratigraphic separation between these and other arrow point
styles.
They are probably not the earliest form present at this
particular site. A significant Austin focus component was found at
the Pilgrim Site (41HI124), where 13 Seal lorn points were collected.
Five specimens were recovered from the Bailey Site (41HI77), while two
probable Seal lorn points were recovered from the surface of 41HI110.
A Seal lorn and another unidentified expanding stem point were
recovered from 41HI157. Single specimens were found at the Reps Davis
Site (x41Hl40) and 41HI107. Several specimens were recorded 1n the
H.D. Sul I ivan collection.from 41Hlll7.
Diagnostic artifacts from the Toyah phase have been collected
from four sites in the Aqui I la Lake area.
In addition to the
extensive Toyah component at the McDonald Site, Perdiz points have
been recovered from the Pi I grim Site (41HI124) and the Aldridge Site
(41HI195), and several Cliffton points collected from the Bailey Site
(41Hl77).
Several other sites yielded Late Prehistoric diagnostics
that could not be placed in either of the established phases.
Two sites have Late Prehistoric components, each primarily
associated with one of the defined phases. Neither, however, is a
single component Late Prehistoric site. The Pilgrim Site (41Hl124),
that also contains Archaic diagnostics, has the most extensive Austin
phase component, while the McDonald Site (41HI105) has the most
extensive Toyah phase component. In addition, the Bailey Site is also
a multicomponent site that has yielded numerous Late Prehistoric
diagnostic artifacts.
Given the size of the sample and the apparent
mixed assemblages, I ittle can be said of the settlement patterns
during this period. There is no apparent change in population density
or site size in the avai I able sample.
Although the data are far from clear, an unusual Late Prehistoric
component seems to be represented by the cultural remains from the
upper levels of Area Bat the McDonald Site. This component may be

contemporaneous with at least the later portion of the Austin phase as
generally defined (Skinner et al. 1978:113;
Lynott 1978:32;
Jelks
1962:98), but with a material culture different from that usually
associated with the Austin phase (Jelks 1962:84-90).
The material
culture of this zone shows some similarities to the material culture
of the Toyah phase. Jelks (1962) I ists smal I dri I Is, such as the two
found in the Surface II excavations at the McDonald Site, and Alto
focus pottery, such as the Kiam Incised vessel from the same area, as
unshared traits of the Toyah phase. Although many of the projectile
points associated with this Late Prehistoric, Area B component are
probably best typed as Alba, others would fit within Jelks' Perdiz
morgan variety. Despite these-similarities, there are four dates from
the uppermost portion of this zone, al I of which are earlier than the
dates generally given for the initiation of the Toyah phase (Chapter
38).
The latest of these four, A.O. 1170 + 70 (TX-3168), fal Is
relatively close to the initiation of the Toyah -phase, particularly
when a two sigma standard deviation is calculated, but none of the
remaining dates overlap into the later period.
The presence of Early Caddoan pottery types in the assemblages
from McDonald and other Central Brazos sites is interesting. Jelks
(1962) I ists Alto focus ceramic types as an unshared trait of the
Toyah phase, despite the fact that the temporal overlap between the
two periods may be brief. Story (1981:14) suggests that the Early
Caddoan (Alto focus) occupation at the Davis Site lasted unti I
A.O. 1260, although Bruseth and Perttula (1981:89-90) point out that
the Sanders focus of northeast Texas, of which Canton Incised is a
major type, probably lasted unti I A.O. 1350 or even later.
Toyah
phase dates are variously given as thirteenth century (Jelks 1962:98),
or as late as A.O. 1300 (Skinner et al. 1978:113;
Prewitt 1981:84).
Generous estimates of the earliest and latest dates of these periods
might place the outset of the Toyah phase as early as A.O. 1200 and
the end of the Sanders focus closer to A.O. 1400, al lowing more than
adequate time for pottery intrusions into the Central
Brazos.
Realistically, however, the accepted dates leave I ittle margin for
contemporaneous contact. This raises the possibi I ity of a cultural
lag between the central Caddo area and the frontier, with cultural
traits reaching the frontier late and surviving somewhat longer.
Examination of the occurrences of Late Prehistoric Central Brazos
ceramics does not provide much evidence for or against such an
assertion. A closer analysis of the proveniences of Toyah phase
ceramics shows that many are from mixed or transitional zones or
components. Most of the sherds from the Hickory Fine Engraved vessel
from the Kyle Site were recovered from Stratum 3, the zone considered
to be intermediate between the Austin and Toyah zones (Jelks 1962:80).
The other possible examples of Toyah phase trade pottery cited by
44-29

CULTURE HISTORY
Jelks are sherds of Holly Fine Engraved and Dunkin Incised from
Buzzard Cave, a shelter with at least some admixture of Austin phase
materials (Long 1961:248). The best evidence for the association of
Caddoan ceramics may come from the Clark Site, where a few sherds of
Canton Incised were found in association with Perdiz points (Watt
1965).
Pointing out these ambiguities is neither intended to question
the definition of the Toyah phase nor to question the association of
ceramics with that phase. The association of a wide variety of bone
tempered plainwares, usually lumped together as Leon Plain, 1s
relatively wel I documented over a large portion of Centrar-Texas.
And, with the exception of the Caddoan ceramics that generally seem
limited to the Central Brazos area, the definition of the Toyah phase
has been validated across a wide area of Central Texas. At present
the evidence is too I imited to accurately date the Caddoan intrusions
in the Central Brazos area or to fully determine the cultural
aff i I iations of these specimens. The dates avai Iable from the Kyle
Site offer an approximate stratigraphic bracket for the ceramics
recovered from the site. The Hickory Fine Engraved vessel from that
site, found primarily in Stratum 3, should have been manufactured
prior to the A.O. 1291 and A.O. 1276 dates from strata 4 and 5 and
later than the A.O. 971 and A.O. 801 dates from Stratum 1 (Jelks
1962:97). A corrected date of A.O. 1265 + 195 from the Clark Site
(Watt 1978:121) may be the best date on a Late Prehistoric ceramic
component, falling near the generally accepted beginning of the Toyah
phase.
Unfortunately, there is considerable inconsistency among the
McDonald Site dates for the ceramic occupation levels (Chapter 38).
The latest of these, A.D. 1170, fal Is just before the upper bracketing
dates at the Kyle Site, with some overlap of the one sigma deviation
figures. The next oldest date from the McDonald Site, at A.D. 940, is
approximately contemporaneous with the latest Austin phase dates from
Kyle Site. The other two McDonald Site dates, A.D. 550 and A.D. 220,
seem too early to date a ceramic occupation.
In any case, the suggestion is made here that Caddoan ceramics
occur relatively early in the Toyah phase and may have entered the
Central Brazos prior to the date generally given for the inception of
the Toyah phase.
Whether this indicates an earlier date for the
beginning of the phase than has been thought, or the association of
ceramics with a slightly different material culture, is difficult to
say. At the McDonald Site, the arrow points associated with ceramics
in Area B seem to show some affinities for both the Perdiz and Alba
types without being clearly definable as either.
An examination---oT
the arrow points in the TARL collection from the Chupek Site on
Aqui I la Creek just above its confluence with the Brazos River, shows a
larger sample of unquestionable Alba types, as wel I as Perdiz and a
few of the Perdiz-Alba variation5-:- Unfortunately, the site 1s

CULTURE HISTORY
relatively shallow and the stratigraphic context of the materials has
been destroyed by plowing.
Watt (1953) has traced the distribution of ceramics through the
Central Brazos River valley. He i I lustrates a wide variety of types,
including Hickory Fine Engraved, Weches Fingernai I Impressed, Sanders
Engraved,
Canton
Incised,
Ripley
Engraved
and a number of
miscellaneous incised, engraved and punctated types.
Although other
aspects of the material culture are not detailed in this paper, the
ceramic assemblages are sorted into four different groups associated
with the Alto, Sanders, Titus and Frankston foci of east and northeast
Texas. Most of the sites he I ists are I inked to the Frankston focus.
Sites with Sanders focus ceramics, which would probably include the
McDonald Site, and with Alto focus ceram1cs are rare. Only two sites
with Sanders focus ceramics are I isted: one is the buried midden (but
not the surface material) at the Asa Warner Site (41ML46), and Sheep
Shelter (41HI55).
Another site that would probably fit into this
group is the Clark Site on the Brazos River upstream from Waco, where
Canton Incised ceramics have been recovered in association with Perdiz
points (Watt 1965).
An examination of the ceramics from the Chupek Site, which Watt
gives as an Alto focus site, suggests that, although many more types
are present, the collections from the McDonald Site, Sheep Shelter,
the Clark Site and perhaps even much of the material from the Asa
Warner Site would be lost in the Chupek material. This may indicate
the
need
for
a re-evaluation of the Central Brazos pottery
distribution, particularly in I ight of refinements in the Caddo
sequence since that time. Watt's documentation of the wide variety of
types present and the suggestion of assemblage differences are sti I I
important basic data, however. It is probable that there are multiple
sources of ceramic diffusion into the area, perhaps along several
important trade routes. At the simplest, a model of diffusion might
suggest movement of Sanders related types and/or design elements from
the
east
of
the northern portion of the area, through the
Richland-Chambers Creek area into the Aqui I la Lake and Lake Whitney
areas, while Alto related material may have entered the southern end
of the area, along the Brazos River near Waco. More detailed study is
needed to test the validity of such a model.
Wherever the Central Brazos ceramics may have originally come
from and whatever their dating, several important questions remain
unanswered. These include whether the actual ceramic vessels were
traded into the area or manufactured locally. Although many of the
vessels from the Central Brazos region, including those at the
McDonald Site, were probably not manufactured in East Texas, there is
no clear evidence that they were made in the Central Brazos either.
Suitable clays for their manufacture could be found not only in the
44-31

CULTURE HISTORY
Brazos Valley, but perhaps throughout the entire Black land Prairie
area.
Archeological investigations have yet to shed much light on
this. Sites with only a few vessels, such as the Kyle Site and the
McDonald Site, are uni ikely to be the locus of manufacture. On the
other hand, the enormous number of vessels represented in the
collection from the Chupek and Asa Warner sites suggests more than
occasional trade pieces. Only chemical provenience studies wi I I be
able to clarify this point.
Another question is the possible diffusion of agriculture into
the Central Brazos. At least some of the ceramic sites are located on
floodplains or low terraces where agriculture is feasible, but to date
the best evidence for it in the area is the single corn cob recovered
from the Kyle Site (Jelks 1962). Such evidence is hardly convincing.
On the other hand, it indicates that at least some Central Brazos
groups were fami I iar with agriculture. Given this fami I iarity and the
apparent absence, or at least rarity, of agriculture, one wonders why
Central Brazos groups did not adopt it.
At present the data base
seems insufficient to answer such a question.
After an apparent peak of population density 1n the Late Archaic,
there is some evidence for a decrease during the Late Prehistoric.
Although the number of sites with Late Prehistoric diagnostics
decreases, this evidence alone may be misleading.
There is, of
course, no hard data on whether dart and arrow points are manufactured
and abandoned with the same frequency. This question is appropriate
when comparing projectile points between any different areas or time
periods, but perhaps more so with the shift in technology. More
importantly, in the case of using projectile point diagnostics to
measure population density, the fact is that arrow points are smaller
and more difficult to see 1n survey.
The majority of al I Late
Prehistoric diagnostics are from sites that were either excavated or
intensively surface collected. If one considers only such carefully
documented sites, the apparent population of the Late Prehistoric may
wel I be the greatest of any period.

CHAPTER 45

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN

Richard P. Watson

INTRODUCTION
Ongoing research now indicates that a revised evaluation of many
known sites within the Aqui I la Reservoir is required. The failure of
previous investigations to place the prehistory of the project area
into a larger regional pers?ective has resulted in significant
interpretive
difficulties.
Toward
the
realization
of
this
perspective, a regional research design is proposed here.
The development and use of regional research designs has been
advocated by a number of archeologists (Binford 1964; Brown and
Struever 1973; Gumerman 1973; House and Schiffer 1975;
King 1971;
Lynott 1977) as the most useful, reliable and cost efficient means of
evaluating the significance of archeological resources.
House and
Schiffer (1975) have pointed out that this is only true if the
regional designs are broadly conceived and implemented.
They note
that as of 1975, none of the regional overviews included the
evaluation of general archeological and anthropological questions but
were limited to substantive questions relevant only to specific
geographic and temporal bounds. In response to what they perceived as
a major shortcoming in most regional research designs, they developed
a design organized along the I ines of substantive,
technical,
methodological and theoretical questions that could be addressed
through the investigation of archeological resources in their area of
study, the Cache River Basin of Arkansas.
The regional research design presented here fol lows the lead of
House and Schiffer and has incorporated questions of a technical,
methodological and theoretical nature, as wel I as the more traditional
substantive
questions
that
can be addressed by archeological
investigations in the Central Brazos. The design proposed by House
and Schiffer has been criticized as accepting generalities as primary
data (Brain 1975). The same criticism can probably be aimed at the
design proposed here, because the present state of our knowledge makes
45-1

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
some generalities unavoidable. Specific data have been included 1n
the fol lowing section as a part of a preliminary evaluation of the
proposed design.
Lynott (1977) has proposed a regional research design for al I of
North Central Texas, extending from the Red River on the north to the
Brazos River on the south, and from the eastern edge of the Blackland
Prairie on the east to the western edge of the Osage Prairie on the
west. This area encompasses substantially more territory than is
included in the present study. The design proposed by Lynott for this
area is based on a series of settlement/subsistence models for five
periods:
Paleoindian Stage, Early-Middle Archaic Stage, Archaic
Stage, Early Neo-American Phase and Late Neo-American Phase.
Aside from the terminological inconsistencies in his use of stage
and phase designations to name periods (Lynott 1977:39, 156-157), the
models proposed for each period are exceedingly general.
This
generality arises from two sources;
the first being the lack of
adequate data for the periods in question, and the second relates to
the overal I size of, and variability in, the study area. North
Central Texas, as defined in his study, includes 23,000 square miles al I or parts of 35 counties and five major environmental zones (Lynott
1977:13). The application of any model of human cultural adaptation
to such a large and varied area requires that it be very general. It
is felt that the research design presented here can f i I I some of the
deficiencies of earlier attempts at regional synthesis and, in
conjunction with these attempts, can provide more specific research
proposals and goals.
SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS
Introduction
Substantive questions deal with those issues relevant to the
understanding of the prehistory and archeology of a given area or
region. The fol lowing discussion presents some of the issues of
interest in Central Brazos prehistory. It is organized along temporal
I ines, beginning with issues important to our understanding of the
Paleoindian occupation of the Central Brazos and continuing to the
Late Prehistoric. This discussion is intended to provide specific
questions and issues that can be addressed from a variety of
perspectives in projects of varying sizes.

1) Lynott (1977) has presented a traditional interpretation of
Paleoindian subsistence, describing it as being a big game hunting
adaptation, while Shafer (1977b) has characterized the Paleoindian
adaptation of North Central Texas as a generalized hunting and
gathering pattern. Which of these or alternative models best explains
the evidence of Paleoindian occupation of the Central Brazos?
Lynott,
states that:

1n

his

model

of

Paleoindian

settlement/subsistence,

Human groups operating in the region at the time were smal I
bands of very mobile hunters and gatherers. Population
density was very low.
The bands probably moved through
recognized territories, but these territories represent
areas at least as large as North-central Texas.
The
settlement pattern was similar to the Restricted Wandering
Model, but the amount of restriction to the movement of the
bands
was
limited.
Subsistence was oriented toward
exploitation of big-game animals, collection of edible
plants at certain seasons, and hunting of smaller game when
necessary. Very I ittle subregional variation in the kinds
of adaptive responses is known to have been present in north
central Texas during this stage.
The Paleoindian Stage materials so far recovered from the Central
Brazos area have not been found in direct association with extinct
megafauna of the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene.
Materials
associated with this stage have most often been recovered from surface
collections with poor associations;
excavated examples are rare.
Paleoindian materials have been excavated from the Ballew and Francis
sites (Watt and Agogino 1968), and the Horn Shelters (Watt 1978).
At
Ballew and Francis, the materials were interpreted as redeposited
(Watt and Agogino 1968). The interpretation is not entirely supported
by the reported evidence, however; it is highly unlikely that the
artifactual materials would be deposited under the same conditions as
the fine sediments from which they were recovered, since no other
coarse materials were present in the deposits.
The Horn Shelters
materials have not yet been fully reported. Watt>s report on the
radiocarbon chronology of the Horn Shelters does not mention any
extinct megafauna, with the exception of large testudinate turtle
remains recovered
from
below
the
cultural
materials
(Watt
1978:131-132).

45-3

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
Shafer (1977b) has
interpreted
the
lack
of
megafaunal
associations with Paleoindian materials 1n North Central Texas as
indicating a reliance on a more generalized pattern of hunting and
gathering.
The mere presence of megafaunal remains in archeological
sites does not constitute proof of their exploitation by Paleoindian
populations.
Two sites from outside the North Central Texas area
contain the remains of extinct horse and mastodon (Shiner 1983).
Bison remains are also reported from the Spring Lake Site, but their
species and associations are not given (Shiner 1983).
The available
evidence for the association and use of Pleistocene megafauna by
Paleoindian populations in Central Texas is inconclusive at best.
Lynett's characterization of this stage as having
a
low
population density and being oriented toward the exploitation of big
game animals reflects a traditional view that does not take into
account the absence of associated megafaunal remains. If, as Shafer
(1977b) suggests, this stage was characterized by a more generalized
hunting and gathering adaptation, the seemingly low population density
may in reality only reflect the absence of projectile
points
associated with big game exploitation.
The evidence necessary to
evaluate even such a general discussion as that proposed by Lynott or
Shafer is not yet avai !able from this area.
The question of
Paleoindian subsistence patterns, then, should provide a fruitful
topic for future research.
2) If this stage was in fact characterized by a generalized
hunting and gathering subsistence, is the seemingly low population
density of this area a function of a lack of archeological recognition
of "atypical" Paleoindian sites? If so, what characteristics can be
used to distinguish Paleoindian assemblages from the later Archaic
assemblages?
On the basis of excavations at the Spring Lake Site in San Marcos
and a review of collections from two other sites associated with
spring deposits (one near Fredericksburg in Central Texas, and the
Ballew Site in North Central Texas), Shiner (1983:6) suggests that
perhaps Paleoindian settlement models are too rigid.
He further
suggests that:
It is clear that some of the springs supported continuous or
nearly continuous occupation for several thousand years. It
also appears that the size of each spring governed the
regularity and duration of that occupation. Larger flows
supported early camps including Clovis and
successive
cultural groups (Shiner 1983:6).

45-4

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
Shiner's model of a sedentary or semi-sedentary Paleoindian
population focusing on the exploitation of localized spring resources
might explain the seemingly low population densities of North Central
Texas.
If a sedentary adaptation was adopted during this period, the
relative number of Paleoindian sites would be expected to exhibit
greater variabi I ity, perhaps with assemblages reflecting specialized
resource procurement activities, and less I ikely to contain the
projectile points associated with this period. A multicomponent site
typology reflecting the sedentary base camp and secondary resource
exploitation sites would be expected, using this model.
If we accept this model, several alternative explanations can be
offered concerning the relatively low density of Paleoindian materials
recovered from North Central Texas.
As noted above, a sedentary
adaptation would result in fewer total sites, thereby decreasing the
I ikel ihood of their discovery. Since the sedentary base camps seem to
be associated with springs - a depositional environment, the discovery
of Paleoindian remains from surface evidence is highly uni ikely.
Resource procurement sites associated with a sedentary base camp are
less I ikely to contain a large range of artifacts, particularlyÂ·
diagnostics, making assignment to the correct period especially
difficult.
The suggestion that certain Paleoindian sites were occupied on a
continuous
or nearly continuous basis represents a significant
departure from the generally accepted settlement model, emphasizing
smal I mobile hunting and gathering groups. Shiner's suggestion of a
sedentary or semi-sedentary adaptation to spring sites seems premature
I ight
of
the evidence he presents in its support.
The
in
characterization of the Spring Lake Site " ... as something I ike a base
camp where essentials were brought back to a central location for
processing" is based on the presence of "scrapers, huge amounts of
chipping debris, preforms, and broken bones of many species of
animals ... " (Shiner 1983:3).
There can be I ittle doubt that this site was a significant
resource and was exploited by Paleoindian and Archaic populations.
However, the presence of large quantities of archeological materials
alone
does not constitute sufficient evidence of a continuous
sedentary occupation spanning several thousand years. The majority of
lanceolate points have been recovered from a single stratum, measuring
only 30 to 40 centimeters in thickness, that contained point types
spanning possibly as much as 5000 years. It is easily possible that

and North Central Texas. While it is not necessary to postulate long
term sedentary adaptations associated with springs, they undoubtedly
served as important nodes in the Paleoindian and Archaic settlement
and subsistence systems.
3) Is the wide variety of Paleoindian projectile points found tn
the Central Brazos indicative of wide ranging population movements or
exchange? Does this variety represent functional or merely sty I istic
variation?
The Paleoindian materials so far recovered in the Central Brazos
are highly variable and are typologically related to materials from
widely scattered areas of the Plains and Southwest. Watt and Agogino
(1968) describe no less than six types of projectile points commonly
associated with the Paleoindian from the Ballew Site (Angostura,
Clovis, Hel Is Gap, Meserve, Mi lesand, Plainview) and an additional
five types from the surrounding area (Agate Basin, Midland, Sandia,
Scottsbluff, San Patrice). The Central Brazos shows perhaps as great
a variety of Paleoindian styles as is found anywhere in North America.
In addition to the more widely distributed point types described by
Watt and Agogino (1968), Watt (1978) has defined the Brazos Fishtai I
dart point from specimens recovered from the Horn Shelters in strata
above a stratum containing a Folsom point fragment and below a strata
from which Midland projectile points were recovered. Radiocarbon
evidence places this type at 9500 - 10,000 B.P.
(Watt 1978:129-131,
136) .
The variety of point types in the Central Brazos poses a number
of interesting questions.
Does this variety reflect population
movements or exchange? Do these point types represent functionally
adaptive differences or are they sty I istic differences unrelated to
function? Are the associated I ithic materials local in origin, or are
they exotic materials obtained through exchange or long distance
population movements? Alternatively, some of the Paleoindian point
types recovered from North Central Texas may have been collected and
perhaps reused by Archaic peoples.
Lynott (1977:157) describes the Paleoindian adaptation as having
very I ittle subregional variation within al I of North Central Texas.
Given the paucity of remains attributable to this period in the
Central Brazos and al I of North Central Texas, such a characterization
is probably premature. The environmental variabi I ity in North Central
Texas could support several different adaptations, and did so during
the latter stages of the Prehistoric, which leads one to question the
advisability of assuming a lack of variabi I ity when proposing a
regional research design intended to stimulate research.

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
Archaic Occupation
The Archaic Stage is wel I represented in the Central Brazos;
being the longest period of occupation and is represented by several
different adaptations. Three major substantive issues are presented
and briefly discussed below.
1) As with the Paleoindian Stage, the Early Archaic Substage 1s
poorly represented, but is critical to an understanding of the
trajectory of the early adaptive systems in the Central Brazos.
What
1s the earliest occurrence of the generalized hunting and gathering
Archaic adaptation?
Does the interpretation of the Paleoindian
adaptation as a generalized hunting and gathering system cal I into
question the traditional definition of the Paleoindian and the
subsequent Early Archaic? Is the Paleoindian Stage a useful concept
as more than a chronological unit in the Central Brazos?

The Early Archaic Substage has not been studied 1n the Central
Brazos, although some examples of research on this period are
available from adjacent areas. Weir (1976) has reviewed the Archaic
in the area south of the Central Brazos, which he cal ls Central Texas.
For clarity in the present paper, this area wi I I be referred to as
South Central Texas, although the southern part of the present study
area includes several of the sites discussed by Weir.
In discussing
the San Geronimo phase (Early Archaic) of the South Central Texas
area, Weir describes a diffuse adaptation of a smal I, non-specialized
population operating within a restricted range. In al I I ikel ihood,
the adaptation in the Central Brazos was very similar to that
described for South Central Texas.
In North Central Texas, the Carrol I ton focus (Crook and Harris
1952) of the Trinity Aspect probably represents a transitional
Paleoindian/Archaic assemblage that was characterized by a hunting and
gathering adaptation.
Crook and Harris (1952:30, 33, 38), in their
discussion of the Carrol I ton focus, noted the apparently early
presence
of
this Archaic assemblage, which included Plainview
projectile points, diagnostic of the Paleoindian Stage.
North Central and South Central Texas thus seem to show an early
occurrence
of
a generalized hunting and gathering adap~ation,
reflected in Archaic
assemblages
associated
with
Paleoindian
diagnostics.
Investigators of Early Archaic manifestations in the
Central Brazos would dowel I to evaluate the nature of the adaptation
during this substage for comparison to the earlier Paleoindian Stage
since a crucial question is the nature of the transition from the
Paleoindian to the Archaic. The use of dimensional analysis similar
to that of Cook (1976) is suggested 1n a later section as one
potentiallyÂ· useful means of comparison.
45-7

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
2) Weir (1976) has described significant changes
1n
the
subsistence patterns from the Early to the Late Archaic in South
Central Texas. Present evidence seems to indicate a substantially
different trajectory for the Central Brazos. Did the Middle Archaic
of the Central Brazos represent a refined or intensified bison focus
as a logical extension of that proposed by Weir (1976) in South
Central Texas?
The Middle Archaic Substage of
South
Central
Texas
is
characterized by Weir (1976) as an adaptation to environmental change
toward a less mes1c climate with a concurrent increase 1n oak.
Cultural adaptation during this substage was one of subsistence
specialization centered on the exploitation of acorns and deer.
Weir
postulates an increased population resulting from the increased
efficiency in exploiting the subsistence base. He also suggests that
intergroup
social
interactions increased, possibly through the
mechanism of cooperation, for the exploitation of seasonally avai I able
resources.
Weir (1976:132) describes his Round Rock phase (2250
B.C. - 650 B.C.) as a "time of cultural coalescence." He characterizes
the later part of the Middle Archaic, the San Marcos phase (650 B.C. A.D. 150), as a transitional period during which bison were present
and Plains traits were introduced, possibly as the result of contact
with Plains groups fol lowing the bison southward. He speculates that
there may have been some reduction in the population at this time.
The specialized subsistence adaptation of Weir 1 s South Central
Texas Middle Archaic is not apparent in the Central Brazos area. The
characteristic burned rock middens associated with this substage do
not occur north of the Brazos River. The single exception is the Ham
Creek Site reported by Forrester (1964), which is located west of the
present study area.
The subsistence system of the Middle Archaic
populations of the Central Brazos appears to have had a different
trajectory from that of South Central Texas, as evidenced by the lack
of the burned rock midden features. At present, the evidence seems to
indicate a continuation of the generalized hunting and gathering
tradition of the preceding Paleoindian Stage and Early Archaic
Substage.
As in South Central Texas, there appears to have been an
increase in population, but not as the result of a highly efficient
subsistence pattern such as that proposed by Weir for South Central
Texas. There is a strong need for a complete study of Middle Archaic
assemblages to further characterize the adaptations present during
this substage.

3) Several authors (Prewitt 1981; Skinner 1981; Weir 1976) have
discussed population trends during the Archaic of South Central Texas.
How do these discussions relate to the Archaic of the Central Brazos?
Do the population trends and settlement patterns of the Central Brazos
Late Archaic support Skinner 1 s (1981) Central Based Wandering model?
45-8

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
Does the avai Iable evidence support Skinner's hypothesis that an
increase in the effective moisture served as a prime mover to
population growth during this stage?
Skinner's (1981) reconstruction of Late Archaic populations and
settlement patterns is not accepted by al I researchers. He describes
a settlement system based on the Central Based Wandering System of
(Beardsley et al. 1956).
However, most of his site information is
derived only from surface data. The bimodal distribution of site size
described by Skinner may only reflect multiple occupations; it has
not been properly evaluated by extensive excavations.
The avai Iable
site survey data seems to support Skinner's interpretation of an
intensive occupation of this region during the Late Archaic.
He
explains the increased population as the result of a slight increase
in effective moisture between 1000 8.C. and A.D. 500.
Environmental
evidence cited in support of this hypothesis is not conclusive,
however, and is derived primarily from data outside the Central
Brazos.
There are more Late Archaic sites than Middle Archaic or Late
Prehistoric sites rn the Aqui I la Creek drainage. However, most of
these sites have been evaluated only on the basis of surface remains,
and the value of temporal and functional assignments on the basis of
such evidence is questionable. Lynett's (1977:158-159) discussion of
the Late Archaic in North Central Texas does not shed much light on
such matters.
He indicates only that there was an
increased
population, resulting in a reduction 1n size of indigenous band
territories with a more restricted wandering pattern and a more
intensive exploitation of bottomland resources. Increased regional
diversification becomes apparent at this time, but adaptive response
rs similar throughout the region (Lynott 1977).
The Late Archaic occupations at the Steele and other sites in
Lake Whitney Basin have been interpreted as "Â· .. smal I social groups
consisting of no more than the extended family" (Stephenson 1970:241).
Such
an
interpretation
runs directly counter to the larger,
agglutinated social units described by Skinner (1981).
The subsistence systems of the Late Archaic populations of the
Central Brazos seem to be oriented toward the exploitation of the
bottom lands, as suggested by Lynott (1977). Mussel shel Is are common
in floodplain and lower terrace sites.
Sites on higher ground,
however, do not show the preservation of faunal materials found in the
lower sites.
It is difficult to characterize the function of the
higher sites, and their role in the subsistence pattern is not clear.

45-9

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
The questions raised by this discussion deal with the problems of
settlement, subsistence and social organization of the Late Archaic
Substage, and several alternatives have been offered to explain the
avai I able evidence.
Investigations of the Late Archaic Substage
should seek evidence of climatic changes that may have resulted 1n
significant population shifts or growth in the Central Brazos.
Late Prehistoric Occupation
This stage is probably the best understood of al I
those
represented in the Central Brazos. As a result, substantive questions
concerning this stage are more specific than those concerning the
earlier stages.
The substantive questions relevant to this stage cover a variety
of topics, ranging from the function of specific formal tools to the
nature of the interactions between the Central Brazos area and the
Caddoan region to the east. The diversity of projectile point forms
found in Central Brazos sites suggests that the local populations were
in contact with broad geographic areas. The nature of this contact
cannot yet be defined, but several alternative suggestions wi I I be
offered below.
Three major questions and a variety of anci I lary
questions on very different levels are discussed.
1) Do Cliffton and/or Granbury points represent preforms
they functionally or sty I istical ly distinct types?

or

are

It has been suggested in a previous section that the Cliffton and
Granbury points may represent preforms for Perdiz and Seal lorn points,
respectively. Alternatively, these types may be separate and have
served distinct functions.
The evidence necessary to support these
alternatives is presented and discussed in the section on projectile
points from the Bailey Site (Chapter 26).
2) What was the nature of contact between the Central Brazos
groups and Caddoan groups of East Texas? Is there evidence supporting
a purely trading relationship;
if so, what were the motivating
factors 1n such a relationship?
Are there sub-areas within the
Central Brazos suggestive of al I iances with specific Caddoan groups?
Could the presence of Caddoan outliers account for the materials found
in the Central Brazos? Could the practice of intergroup marriage
between Central Brazos populations and Caddoan groups explain the
Caddoan style materials from this area? Is there evidence to suggest
such a relationship in the Caddoan region?

45-10

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
In addition to the variety of projectile points indigenous to the
Caddoan area, the presence of East Texas ceramic types in the Central
Brazos indicates contact with Caddoan groups.
The ceramic evidence
seems to offer the best opportunity for understanding the nature of
this interaction. The ceramics recovered from sites in the Central
Brazos indicate an extended period of contact with East Texas groups.
Ceramic types associated with the Alto, Sanders, Frankston, and Titus
phases of East Texas have been found in this area (Jelks 1953, 1961,
Watt 1941, 1953, 1956,
1962; Long 1961; Stephenson 1947, 1970;
1965).
Caddoan style ceramics 1n the Central Brazos have usually been
interpreted as trade pieces.
The fol lowing discussion presents
various alternative explanations
and
briefly
discusses
their
implications for research.
A) The Caddoan ceramics 1n the Central Brazos are the
trade.

result

of

While Caddoan style trade pieces are often
described
1n
discussions of the Late Prehistoric archeology of this area, the
problem of the nature of this trade is seldom addressed. The presence
of Central Texas chert in East Texas has been suggested as a possible
motivation for exchange between these two areas (Shafer 1973).
The
chert sources represented are substantially farther south than the
Central Brazos, and it is uni ikely that the material would be
exchanged through such a circuitous route as the Central Brazos. Such
an alternative as the juncture of the southeast-flowing Brazos River
should not be overlooked, and the north-south trending edge of the
Edwards Plateau and Cross Timbers in the Central Brazos may have
provided a natural crossroads, bringing together peoples from widely
scattered parts of Texas and the southern Plains.
The variety of
extra-regional traits and artifacts found 1n the Central Brazos
supports such a conclusion.
If the East Texas style ceramics found in this area are
interpreted to be the result of trade, then several questions should
be asked concerning the nature of the ceramic remains. Sty I istical ly,
pieces from or related to ceramics of the Alto, Sanders, Frankston and
Titus phases have been recovered.
A detailed analysis of design
elements on the Central Brazos materials, for comparison with East
Texas examples, might provide evidence on the possible or1g1n of the
traded pieces. Once the scope of possible sources has been limited, a
more detailed analysis of ceramic characteristics
relating
to
manufacturing technology and raw material sources should be undertaken
to verify the source area.

45-11

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
B) The Caddoan ceramics in the Central Brazos are the result
losses by Caddoan groups temporarily resident in this region.

of

Hunting groups from East Texas are known to have exploited at
least a portion of this area during the Historic Period. Hunting
groups or other resource procurement parties might be responsible for
the Caddoan ceramics of Central Texas. Ceramics carried for use or
exchange by such specialized activity groups may have been broken or
traded and may account for the ceramics recovered in this area. Some
of the vessels are of good qua I ity and are highly decorated and this
would seem to argue against their introduction through such an
informal mechanism as lossÂ· by groups not specifically involved 1n
exchange of some kind.
C) The ceramics 1n the Central Brazos fol low the Caddoan
technological and sty I istic traditions, but are of local manufacture
by: a) ful I time resident Caddoan groups, b) native Central Brazos
groups, or c) Caddoan potters (women) who resided with the Central
Brazos groups.
It has been suggested 1n Chapter 38 that the McDonald Site
ceramics do not correspond wel I with certain aspects of East Texas
ceramics. The primary differences are in the paste characteristics of
color and texture.
The Central Brazos materials are substantially
darker than the reds and browns common to the Caddoan region.
Watt's
(1953) descriptions of ceramics from a variety of sites throughout
this region indicate that these differences are widespread and may
crosscut stylistic and temporal variations.
Paste characteristics can vary for a wide variety of reasons,
including clay sources, firing temperatures, and temper or other
inclusions in the clay body. It is possible that the vessels in the
Central Brazos are trade pieces that do not conform to the typical
East Texas paste characteristics, an alternative that has not yet been
thoroughly investigated.
But, if these characteristics are found to
occur throughout the range of styles and time periods in the Central
Brazos, serious consideration must be given to the possibility of
local manufacture and a resident Caddoan population. The imp I ications
of a ful I time resident Caddoan population in the Central Brazos are
far reaching and cannot be more than briefly summarized here.
If a Caddoan group inhabited the Central Brazos,
several
expectations can be offered as to the nature of the archeological
remains which would occur. Based on both archeological manifestations
1n East Texas and on historical Caddoan occupation in this region,
sites can be expected to be located 1n relation to
adequate
cultivatable soi Is and to consist of a dispersed vi I Iage type
settlement pattern, perhaps associated with a series of smal I hamlets.
45-12

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
The remains from any such site should be essentially Caddoan in
character, but of local Central Brazos materials
chips, I ithics,
etc. Most, if not al 11 of Caddoan material culture should be expected
to occur under these circumstances.
No such sites have been identified in the Central Brazos although
the Chupik Site has been offered as a possibi I ity. Jelks (1962) 1
however, maintains that the ceramics are the only clearly Caddoan
materials from the site. If we accept this interpretation, then it
seems uni ikely that any Caddoan groups maintained a ful I time resident
population in this area.
The wholesale adoption of an alien technology and stylistic
tradition by native Central Brazos groups seems highly uni ikely. The
execution of the ceramics and the lack of any stylistic variation
argue for manufacture by potters trained in, and intimately associated
with, the Caddoan ceramic tradition.
Alternatively, the occurrence of Caddoan ceramics, particularly
those with atypical paste characteristics, might be explained by the
presence of a group of Caddoan potters permanently resident in the
Central Brazos area. Jelks (1962:92) has argued that, at least in the
case of the Chupik Site, the presence of the Alto focus ceramics is
the only characteristic I inking the Central Brazos with the Caddoan
region. The presence of Caddoan potters would not necessarily imply a
Caddoan occupation of the Central Brazos.
In I ight of the very
I imited evidence, it appears that Caddo women, who were potters, were
I iving with the local Central Brazos peoples. Such an explanation
would account for the Caddoan ceramics in the Central Brazos and for
the presence of a foreign sty I istic and technological tradition,
represented by the McDonald Site ceramics. Several explanations can
be offered to explain how Caddo women came to be I iving with
non-Caddoan groups in the Central Brazos, capture and intergroup
marriage being the most obvious. It is proposed here that the later
alternative is the most I ikely explanation.
The possibi I ity of intergroup marriage between the peoples of
East Texas and the Central Brazos receives substantial support from
the work of Troike (1957) 1 who has demonstrated that the kinship
terminologies of the Hasinai Caddo and the Tonkawa were virtually
identical in spite of dissimilar languages, and that the Tonkawa
adopted the Hasinai terminology prior to contact with Europeans. To
quote Jelks' discussion of Troike's research: "This suggests that the
Tonkawa and Hasinai had more than a nodding acquaintanceship in
prehistoric times, a conjecture which is supported by the archeology"
(Jelks 1961:69). The presence of women trained in the Caddoan ceramic
tradition among groups probably ancestral to the historic Tonkawa
(Suhm 1960) also explains the relative lack of other materials and

traits indicative of a Caddoan occupation.

45-13

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN

The or1g1ns of such a system of intergroup marriage may be
related to the initiation of a system of bison hunts by Caddoan
groups. Campbel I (1961) has argued that the bison hunt was probably a
very old cultural feature and may have had wide ranging imp! ications
for cultural change, contact and exchange:
The Plains traits in the western Caddo foci are to some
extent
i I luminated
by
certain
ethnographic
detai Is
concerning the historic Caddo in Texas, particularly the
Hasinai groups, who are I inked with the Allen Focus as wel I
as the preceding Frankston Focus of the Caddoan area.
According to Spanish sources, groups of Hasinai frequently
left their forested area to hunt bison in the grasslands of
central Texas.
One account states that the nearest bison
were more than 40 leagues from Hasinai territory. This, of
course, is after the Hasinai obtained horses from Europeans,
but lengthy bison-hunting trips to the west were probably a
very old cultural feature in the western portion of the
Caddoan area. The records of the De Soto expedition refer
to it.
In this we have a specific local mechanism that
helps to explain movement of cultural traits from the
Caddoan area to central Texas and vice versa. For the most
part these hunting trips must have been made into open areas
or areas occupied by friendly tribes, and possibly there
were sometimes joint bison-hunting expeditions that involved
extended
visits
to friendly vi I I ages in central and
northcentral Texas (Campbell 1961).
It has been argued similarly in a previous section that the
relatively late practice of the winter hunt by displaced Caddoan
groups resident in the Central Brazos during the mid-nineteenth
century suggests a strong cultural tradition with a long history.
Several promising research possibi I ities present themselves if
this hypothesis 1s accepted.
If the sty I istic and technological
investigations described above are able to identify source areas for
those ceramics that are deemed to have been traded, it may be possible
to construct a testable model of reciprocity between two or more
groups as represented by selected sites in the two areas of interest.
Such a model would be greatly faci I itated by the use of ethnographic
and ethnohistorical descriptions of tribal and kinship relationships
such as that presented by Troike (1957). The presentation of such a
model 1s beyond the scope of this report, however, and should be
undertaken with more specific goals and direction than can be provided
here.

45-14

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
Another I ine of research would be an analysis of artifacts with
regard to their function and the presumed sex of the user. If women
were exchanged between these two areas, artifacts associated with
typically female activities such as food preparation, hide working and
weaving are more likely to reflect the cultural traditions of the
female
consanguineal groups.
Female associated artifacts would
therefore include scrapers and informal
cutting
and
scraping
implements, burnishing stones, beamers and other hide working tools
such as needles and awls, and grinding slabs and manos.
Male
associated artifacts would include tools associated pri~ari ly with
hunting activities and stone tool manufacture.
Most formal flaked
stone tools, then, are probably associated with masculine activities.
As a result, in addition to Caddoan cer.amics in the Central Brazos,
other typically East Texas tools or ornaments associated with females
Conversely, female associated artifacts
can be expected to occur.
typical of Central Brazos groups would be expected to occur in Caddoan
sites.
If a system of intergroup marriage existed between Caddoan groups
of East Texas and groups native to the Central Brazos, it is
reasonable to expect that such items such as ceramics and weapons
probably moved between these two areas as wel I. Projectile points
typical of Caddoan groups (Alba) occur in the Central Brazos.
Point
types not typical of the region in which they are found, particularly
if they are made of exotic or non-local materials, should be more
common 1n sites that also contain other evidence of exchange, such as
ceramics.
It is proposed that as the Caddoan groups extended their
activities westward, possibly in search of new or additional resources
such as bison or I ithic sources, a system of mutually advantageous
exchange developed between the Central Brazos populations and certain
Caddoan groups. Therefore, while some of the ceramics found in this
area were probably the result of trade, many, and perhaps most, were
of local manufacture by resident Caddo women I iving with Central
Brazos groups.
That the contact between these groups was not always friendly 1s
suggested by evidence of violent death and hasty interment of 22
individuals excavated by the Central Texas Archeological Society 1n
1936 (Lux 1937;
Meroney 1936; Turner 1937). The only culturally
diagnostic artifacts recovered from these excavations were three
Perdiz arrow points from the body cavity and immediate vicinity of one
individual and a single ear spool, undoubtedly of Caddoan or1g1n.
A
single artifact cannot, of course, be considered conclusive evidence
of the cultural aff i I iation of an entire group.
However, the fact
that ear spools are very rare in this area, but common in the Caddo
region, suggests that at least one individual was from the Caddoan

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
area.
This site may even be interpreted to support the hypothesis of
the capture of women (potters), who then I ived with the Central Brazos
groups.
The distribution of the various Caddoan ceramic styles in the
Central Brazos region may prove to be useful in defining alliances
between these two areas.
Cultural changes and changing resource
requirements through time are also very probably reflected in the
distribution of outside elements in these regions.
3) Why was agriculture not adopted in the Central Brazos area?
The lack of agriculture in this area may be more apparent than
real,
and future research should actively seek such evidence.
Archeological investigations not specifically seeking evidence of
agricultural remains are not likely to find them, given the nature of
preservation in the Central Brazos. However, as has been pointed out
by Boserup (1965), perhaps it is unreasonable to expect that any group
exposed to agriculture would immediately adopt it. In the case of the
Central Brazos, the advantages of agriculture, or more appropriately
horticulture, would probably be far from obvious. The rich material
environment produced by the close juxtaposition of several biotic
provinces would be wel I suited to a hunting and gathering adaptation.
The
soi Is
of
this area are not necessarily wel I suited to
horticultural pursuits. The Indians were never able to cultivate
heavy soi Is;
neither were the Europeans prior to the development of
the steel plow in 1837. It is uni ikely that the heavy clay soi Is
could be cultivated with digging sticks and native hoes. In fact, as
noted in Chapter 38, even the early European settlers in this area
chose the sandy soi Is of the Cross Timbers. The two historic Caddoan
vi I lages whose locations are known in the Central Brazos, the Towash
and Jose Maria vii lages, occur in areas of sandy sediment that seem to
have been
intentionally
selected.
Late
Prehistoric
Caddoan
settlements, if they occur in the Central Brazos, wi I I probably be
located in areas of sandy soi Is conducive to cultivation.
TECHNICAL QUESTIONS
The environments and archeology of the Aqui Ila drainage and the
larger Central Brazos provide an opportunity to develop and evaluate
techniques for the discovery and investigation of sites under varying
conditions.
The technical questions raised in this section relate to
the environments and sites found in this area, but have broader
imp I ications for research in similar regions.
and

1) What techniques are potentially most useful in the location
evaluation of buried unexposed sites in the Aquil la drainage and

the Central Brazos?
45-16

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN

Sites such as the McDonald Site, the McKenzie Site, the Borrowed
Site, the Waco sewage treatment plant site and the Walton Site burials
on the Brazos, indicate that buried sites with good to excel lent
fauna! preservation, intact features, and contextual relationships
occur in this area. Several techniques can be suggested to locate
such sites.
The use of coring equipment, such as a truck mounted
Giddings soi I core, a backpack mechanical earth dri I I with a soi I
sampling bucket or barrel auger, should be effective means of locating
sites buried in the alluvial soi Is of this region. In addition, the
resulting soi I cores would provide a record of the stratigraphic
sequences of the local alluvial
terraces
and,
coupled
with
palynological and phytol ith analysis, could provide a basis for the
detailed reconstruction of climatic and environmental change discussed
in the previous section.
These cores could also be useful for
determining site I imits if used in conjunction with chemical soi I
tests such as phosphate analysis (Eidt 1973; Hassan 1978, 1979, 1981;
Proudfoot 1975; Provan 1975; Schwartz 1967; Woods 1977).
The use of coring or trenching equipment during the initial
surveys of the Aqui I la Lake area would have found both 41Hl104 and
41HI105 (McDonald Site). The location of 41HI104 1n a borrow pit
resulted in the destruction of most of the site. Examination of the
major borrow pits during the last season of excavation and during the
Management Data Survey, showed that several previously unrecorded
sites were partially or totally destroyed by borrow activities.
The use of non-destructive methods would represent a major
advance 1n archeological techniques.
The use of magnetometers has
proven to be a valuable tool in locating buried magnetic anomalies
such as those caused by hearths and architectural remains (Tite 1972).
The uniform sediments of the lower alluvial terraces in the Black land
Prairie would very I ikely be amenable to the use of magnetometer
survey. These surveys, however, require expensive equipment and are
not wel I suited to the investigation of large areas in the time frame
required by most contract investigations. House and Schiffer (1975)
have suggested that acoustic holography and electromagnetic detection
might prove to be valuable aids to site location in floodplains such
as those of Hackberry Creek. The conditions amenable to testing these
and other high technology approaches are found in much of the Central
Brazos area. The uti I ity of such high technology approaches, however,
can only be tested if they can be made cost effective.
2) What techniques can be used or developed to evaluate and
compensate for the effects of various post-depositional impacts,
including cultivation, agricultural terracing, erosion and selective
collection by pothunters? What are the effects of collection bias on

the part of the investigating archeologists?
45-17

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN

The evaluation of these impacts wi I I al low the archeologist to
better understand the significance of the artifact patterns exposed on
the surface. Recent investigations on the effects of agricultural
practices on artifact distributions have pointed to the importance of
soi I characteristics in the displacement of artifactual materials
(Ford and Roi ingson 1972; Medford 1972). The variety of cultivated
soi Is in the Central Brazos area offers an opportunity to further
evaluate these effects and those of varying cultivation practices.
These effects can be developed by the comparison of single
assemblage characteristics between sites having good associations
(McDonald, Kyle, and Bear Creek), to define cultural regularities. If
sufficient regularities exist to support the presence of comparable
activities or dimensions
(Cook
1976),
statistical
regression
techniques would be reasonable predictors of materials not present due
to selective collection or other factors such as preservation and
erosion. Such a study is obviously beyond the scope of this work, but
is suggested as a useful approach.
The value of artifact collections amassed by private collectors
has been amply demonstrated by Luchterhand (1970) and Skinner et al.
(1978) and is suggested as potentially very useful to understanding
the Central Brazos.
The analysis of collections, in an effort to
define collecting habits and impact on site assemblages, has not been
undertaken.
Skinner et al. (1978) noted several sites known only to
a single collector in the Aqui I la Lake area.
These sites offer an
important opportunity to determine the degree to which the collector
effect biases both surface and subsurface site assemblages.
Another approach to the evaluation of certain post-depositional
impacts 1s through the systematic investigation of sites for which
historic impacts can be discovered or reconstructed.
Historic land
use patterns have probably destroyed or faci I itated the destruction of
more sites than al I of the natural processes combined. By evaluating
the disruptive effects of land use patterns in the Central Brazos, a
better understanding of the nature of the archeological evidence can
determined
and interpretations refined.
Recent studies of
be
agricultural impacts (Ford and Rolingson 1972;
Medford 1972) have
generally not dealt with the long term effects of specific practices.
By using the historical data avai Iable from local farmers, these
impacts can be better addressed. Various environmental variables such
as soi Is, soi I moisture,
rainfal I
patterns,
topographic
and
microtopographic features, and freeze-thaw cycles, can be incorporated
and developed into models of disturbance.

45-18

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
In a related vein, I ittle research has been conducted on the
effect of chemical and physical environments on the preservation of
macrofloral, microfloral and fauna! remains. The presence of sites in
the Aqui I la drainage in proximity to each other, yet in highly
different depositional environments, provides an excel lent opportunity
to investigate relevant factors - pH, pedoturbation, and average soi I
moisture, for example.
Such a study would provide much needed
guidance as to what factors, in a given area, wi I I probably be most
useful in determining site data potential and recovery costs.
House and Schiffer (1975:174-175) suggest that the relative size
of an artifact is directly proportional to the I ikel ihood of its being
collected from the surface of a site.
Many of the sites in the
Aqui I la Basin provide excel lent opportunities to evaluate the degree
to which size biases the collection of materials by
artifact
collectors, as wel I as by archeologists. A technique incorporating a
variety of surface collection procedures by both amateurs
and
professionals and comparing them with a recovery technique in which
samples of the upper 2 to 5 centimeters of soi I are completely removed
and screened to recover the artifacts, would provide a data base for
such an evaluation.
A comparison of the resulting two artifact
samples would provide much useful information on the biases introduced
by size effect, and might suggest means by which it can be minimized.
METHODOLOGICAL QUESTIONS
Methodological questions deal with issues most

to

the

1) What types of data collection and analysis of the Central
Brazos materials provide the information necessary to address the
substantive questions discussed above?
Functional classifications have been proposed as one means of
addressing adaptations of prehistoric peoples. The wear analysis on
the modified debitage from the Aqui I la Reservoir is one approach to
such a classification.
As noted by House and Schiffer (1975), such
classifications cannot be strictly artifact-bound.
A more fruitful
approach is an analysis focused on an activity or task (Cook 1976:3-7)
which, when coupled with experimentation, can provide the functional
perspective necessary to answer substantive questions concerning
prehistoric adaptations in the Central Brazos.
Residual organic matter adhering to archeological materials,
particularly I ithics, can provide important insight into the function
of certain tools.
Such residues are present on some materials
excavated from the Aqui I la Lake area. The analysis of artifactual
45-19

REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN
materials has often overlooked the potential for the study of adherent
residues reflective of use (Briuer 1976; Shafer and Holloway 1979).
The microscopic examination of selected artifacts from several sites
in the Aqui I la drainage indicates that such residues are preserved
under less favorable conditions than are generally recognized by
archeologists.
The indiscriminate washing of al I artifacts may have
destroyed the most reliable indicator of use avai Iable to the
archeologist.
The preservation of a variety of fauna I remains (mussel shel 1,
turtle shel I and bone) in the alkaline Tinn clay soi Is of the Aqui I la
area provides an excel lent opportunity for the investigation of
seasonality in the prehistoric occupations of this region. The
analysis of freshwater mussels, which are often preserved in Central
Brazos sites, shows potential for the determination of seasonality.
The common occurrence of deer in the fauna! materials from some areas
of the Central Brazos may provide yet another means of determining the
season of occupation. The analysis of deer tooth growth patterns
shows substantial promise in that direction (Kay 1974:224-227).
Another, as yet unexplored, means of determining seasonality may be
the microscopic examination of turtle shel Is. The incremental growth
of these structures probably reflects environmental variables, much as
the she I I of a mussel does.
2) Can models, based on environmental correlates, be developed to
predict the site information potential of sites prior to their
excavation?
The correlation of various environmental characteristics such as
soi Is, landforms, and distance to water or cultivable land, are al I
important to understanding prehistoric adaptations to the Central
Brazos.
Some of these correlations, moreover, may also offer
additional insight on the information potential of certain sites.
As
research continues, the information content of excavated and tested
sites, i.e., types of features, degree of subsurface disturbance,
preservation of floral and fauna I remains, pollen, phytol iths, etc.,
can be correlated with various environmental characteristics, such as
topographic position, soi ls-pH, shrink-swel I, phosphates, depositional
environment, etc. From this, site information models can be developed
to help 1n determining the research potential of sites in a given
setting. The initial data for such a system is found in the
computerized site files of the Texas Heritage Conservation Plan. The
large scale manipulation of these data is beyond the scope of the
present study, although a preliminary attempt at a simple level is
presented in the fol lowing section. Site information models offer a
useful aid to the resource manager, as wel I as providing an evaluation
of sites relative to the known regional resources.
These models
would, of course, require continuous updating as new information

became available.

House and Schiffer (1975) have suggested that a model of culture
change based on the ecological and evolutionary concept of adaptive
radiation could be applied to the Cache River Basin. Such a model has
substantial appeal for use in the Central Brazos as wel I. Do the
various cultural manifestations present rn this area
represent
gradually changing stylistic boundaries caused by cultural drift
(Binford 1963), or are they the result of more active processes such
as immigration?
The Late Prehistoric Stage of this area offers an
excel lent opportunity to develop and test such a model of culture
change.
The adoption of ceramics, whether by local manufacture or trade,
and of certain arrow point forms, and the apparent rejection of
agriculture are potentially very important in defining the mechanisms
of culture change during the Late Prehistoric of the Central Brazos.
Of particular interest is the practice of horticulture. The available
evidence does not indicate that horticulture was practiced in the
Central Brazos during the Late Prehistoric.
Horticulture
was
certainly known to the Late Prehistoric populations of this area since
they were in contact with farming groups to the East. It could even
be argued that the presence of Caddo women, as suggested above,
brought experienced horticultural ists into the Central Brazos at this
time.
Why, under these circumstances, was horticulture not adopted?
The investigation of this topic could shed I ight on the conditions,
both cultural and environmental, under which the introduction of
agriculture extracts too high a cultural price. If the hypothesized
social relations between Central Brazos groups and Caddoan groups can

processes of selective adoption of cultural traits can be undertaken.
How do these processes compare to those ethnographical ly documented

Schiffer (1975) discusses the general factors relating to the
identification of occupation span in archeological sites. He notes
that the number of smal I sites in the Cache River Basin lends itself
wel I to the investigation of occupation span. Asimilar situation
exists in the Aqui I la drainage, where research has been sufficiently
intense to identify such sites.
The comparisons of the relative proportion of subsistence related
materials to those more concerned with maintenance have been shown by
Yellen (1977) to be directly related to the length of occupation.
House and Schiffer (1975:179) also note that artifacts which are
curated, that is carried from one place to another with the intention
of future use, are most I ikely to occur only on sites with relatively
long occupations. In order to evaluate the Central Brazos sites in
these terms, models describing subsistence, maintenance and curation
activities in terms of their material manifestations
must
be
developed.
The models for the various cultural stages proposed by
Lynott (1977) lack sufficient specificity to be of use in this
endeavor since adaptations are discussed only in the most general
terms. The discussion of the Austin and Toyah foci by Jelks (1962),
on the other hand, provides a more useful starting point for such a
model of the Late Prehistoric.
Jelks' discussion of the material
culture of the Austin and Toyah phases at the Kyle Site provides
sufficient culture and occupation specific data to begin to evaluate
evidence of occupational variation. Given the previous research in
this area and the avai labi I ity of ethnohistoric data on the presumed
historic descendents of the Toyah phase populations, adequate models
could be developed. The application of these models to the analysis
of smal I sites in the Central Brazos provides an opportunity to
further refine our understanding of site formation processes and
assemblage variabi I ity.
3) What are the mechanisms of stylistic change found in the
Central Brazos, and how do they relate to the general study of culture
change?
Difficulties in separating sty I istic variabi I ity from functional
variabi I ity in stone tools comp I icate the study of prehistoric
sty I istic change in the Central Brazos.
By the Late Prehistoric,
ceramics in the Caddoan tradition appear, offering remains more
readily suited to studies of sty I istic change.
If some of these
ceramics are of local manufacture, then the study of sty I istic
variabi I ity is possible, perhaps fol lowing the lead of Deetz (1965).
On the other hand, if these ceramics were introduced only through
exchange, then such a study would not be profitable.

DISCUSSION
The questions posed in this chapter are intended to provide
directions for research in the Central Brazos. This chapter has
deviated from the more traditional approach to a regional research
design in not adopting an overriding theoretical perspective. By so
doing it is felt that the resulting research design is not so
confining as to constrict future research, but is one providing
sufficient detai I to al low the development of meaningful research from
several different theoretical perspectives.
Fol lowing the lead of House and Schiffer (1975), this section has
framed a number of questions in terms of their orientation as either
substantive, technical, methodological or theoretical.
They are
sufficiently comprehensive to be applied to any number of research
perspectives and goals, and wi I I result in a better and more
comprehensible perspective on the prehistory of the Central Brazos.

DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH IN THE CENTRAL BRAZOS

David 0. Brown

RESEARCH DESIGN
The fol lowing section summarizes some of the more important
problems facing archeological research in the Central Brazos region
and suggests a few simple approaches to rectifying these problems.
Like most re~earch designs, it is of necessity incomplete, selecting
certain aspects of prehistory for research at the expense of others.
It is not intended to replace the research designs formulated by
Lynott (1977) and Watson (1982, Chapter 45), but only to supplement
and bui Id upon them from the perspective of ten years of research in
the Aqui I la Lake area.
The fol lowing I ists some of the more obvious research problems
with the local area as wel I as I isting data sources that might be
useful in the solution of larger scale archeological problems.
As
Watson (Chapter 45) has pointed out (after Schiffer and House 1975),
research designs may contain technical, theoretical and methodological
questions as wel I as substantive ones. The view taken here is that
although the primary goal of archeology should be
to
answer
theoretical and processual questions, such answers wi I I not be
possible
without
better
control
of
the
substantive
or
cu Iture-h i stor i ca I issues.
A11 of these specific issues can be
subsumed under a number of general themes, most of which are central
to prehistoric archeological research in any region. These themes are
discussed briefly below, and fol lowing them are a number of regionally
or culturally specific questions that make up the bulk of the research
design.
RESEARCH THEMES
One of the foremost needs of research 1n the Central Brazos
region, as in many others, is the delineation of a sol id chronological
framework. The existing framework, defined in only the broadest terms
46-1

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
and anchored primarily by cross dating to other regions, generally
represents the extension of chronological sequences from other areas
into the C~ntral Brazos region. The notable exception is the locally
defined distinction between the Austin and Toyah phases of the Late
Prehistoric.
What is most urgently needed is a locally defined and
radiometrical ly dated chronological sequence on the order of those
derived for Central Texas by Weir (1976) and Prewitt (1981).
Building this sequence wi I I require excavations at numerous
deeply stratified sites, such as the McDonald Site. Finding such
sites may require adjustments in survey methods and even necessitate
relatively large commitments of time and money to subsurface sampling
aided by machinery. The AquiJ la Lake region is an excel lent example
of an area where such a strategy would have paid enormous dividends.
As it happened, most of the avai I able time and funds had been expended
by the time it was discovered that the floodplain above the dam was
dotted with deep stratified sites essentially destroyed in dam
construction.
Even the McDonald Site, the only deep stratified site
investigated, was not discovered unti I the first season of mitigation
excavations.
Another research possibi I ity in the region 1s the development of
a time-sensitive perspective on shifting cultural boundaries. At
various times, authors have referred cultural traits from the region
to defined cultural assemblages from other regions (see Forrester 1964
for a discussion of the Ham Creek Site and its relationship to the
Trinity, LaHarpe and Central Texas aspects of the Archaic Period). In
the first place, the local characteristics should be collected and
emphasized as a subregional unit or assemblage. Such an exercise
would be an essential part of the development of chronological periods
discussed
above.
Secondly,
the
changing nature of specific
extra-regional influences must be examined on a phase by phase basis.
While shifting boundaries can be
assessed
through
tight
chronological control and the analysis of trait I ists from excavated
sites and local collections, such a perspective may be limited in
actual boundary areas. In such areas, the material culture of local
populations may reflect a melding of traits typically indigenous to
surrounding regions.
More detailed excavations of single component
sites near the supposed frontier are needed to detect the often subtle
evidence of cultural interactions. The study of cultural interactions
can be an important clue to the interpretation of regional social
integration and the development of large scale complex societies.
Once the chrono-spatial parameters of regional culture history
have been established with some degree of certainty, it is possible to
delve more deeply into changing patterns of resource exploitation,
another critical need throughout the Central Brazos River Valley.

46-2

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
Prehistoric subsistence information from isolated sites from the
region
can
be
gathered
and
synthesized
in
its
proper
areal-environmental setting. Questions pertaining to diversification
of exploitation strategies and site specific procurement strategies
can be addressed. Potential populations and resource stresses can be
identified.
A final significant theme of research in the Central Brazos River
Valley is the identification of climatic and environmental changes,
and the determination of the potential relevance of these changes to
area cultures.
Some of the parameters of these changes have been
independently investigated (See Chapter 2). However, their intensity
and duration are currently inadequately documented and difficult to
apply to hypothesized cultural changes.
Briefly summarized, these themes are the development of a precise
chronological
framework, the determination of shifting boundary
patterns, the examination of group
interactions
and
regional
integration,
the
elucidation of changing patterns of resource
exploitation and the understanding of the interrelationship between
changing environment and culture.
Most of the specific research
questions I isted below are extensions of these general themes.
Most
of the issues have been dealt with in one of the preceding summary
chapters and are I isted with I ittle or no comment.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Paleoindian Period
In general, the Paleoindian Period is al I but unknown 1n the
Central
Brazos
region,
despite the documentation of numerous
projectile points in collections and the excavation of several large
sites.
The information currently avai I able to archeologists al lows
I ittle more than the statement that the area was inhabited during this
period.
An enormous amount of data remains to be gathered before
urban growth, agricultural intensification and reservoir construction
destroy what I ittle intact information is left. The discovery and
excavation of stratified Paleoindian sites throughout the region is a
critical necessity.
Given the paucity of such sites , it wi I I
probably be necessary to supplement this research with the examination
of as many private collections as possible.

1.

Most researchers feel that the Late Pleistocene in Texas may
have been slightly more mesic than during most of the
Holocene, with a greater dominance of arboreal plants in some

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
areas.
How did the Late Pleistocene environment of the
Central Brazos differ from its modern counterpart and, in
particular, what big game species would have been avai I able?
Were there I ikely to be significant differences at this time
between big game densities in the Cross Timbers area and the
Blackland Prairie?
2.

Clovis projectile points have been recovered from the Central
Brazos region. Do these specimens represent intrusions into
the region by big game hunting parties or an adaptation to
the resources of the region by local groups?
If the
intrusion hypothesis is demonstrated, was the group fol lowing
south or eastward straying big game, or was the intrusion
oriented to the exploitation of lesser ranked resources
during times of big game scarcity?

3.

Although the archeological remains of the succeeding Folsom
hunters are nowhere particularly common, they are exceedingly
rare in the Central Brazos. Could this represent use of the
area by cultures manufacturing the Folsom point but uti I izing
a different, non-hunting oriented, adaptive strategy?
Or
does it reflect either infrequent use of the area or use by a
different Paleoindian tradition?
If the latter is true,
could this tradition be related to early Paleoindian cultures
using either Dalton or Brazos Fishtai I projectile points?

4.

During the later portion of the Paleoindian Period, the Plano
culture seems to once again unite east and west in a similar
cultural expression. If this is true, was it a mutual
development of both plains and forest cultures or did the
cultural boundary shift much farther to the east during this
time?
Were there regional differences 1n the adaptive
strategies practiced by the various groups who used the
lanceolate points usually grouped together as Plainview? If
so, what adaptive strategies were uti I ized in the Central
Brazos region and how do they relate to neighboring regions
at the same time?
Early Archaic

If possible, the Early Archaic Period of the Central Brazos
region IS even more poor I y known than the Paleoindian. This IS
because the emphasis on Paleoindian research and excavation In
surrounding areas permits the extrapolation of such data into the
Central Brazos region, a I lowing a modicum of cross
referenced
theoretical statements.
The Early Archaic, on the other hand, IS
poorly known outside the Central Brazos 1n many parts of Texas.
A

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
great deal of basic information is necessary to f i I I the enormous
lacunae in our knowledge of this period. As with the Paleoindian data
gathering, the excavation of many stratified sites wi I I be necessary.
The search for good preservation conditions is particularly essential
during this period.
Most of the open sites with good preservation
during the later periods exhibit considerable deterioration
of
materials from the earlier components. Again, collections research
wi I I probably be a foregone necessity.

1.

Part or al I of this period is often correlated with the
Post-Pleistocene thermal optimum period where mesic Late
Pleistocene environments may have desiccated rather rapidly
in places.
To what degree are the cultures of the Early
Archaic a response to this drying trend?
If there is a
response, is it an immediate one or are adaptations to the
changing climate progressive and cumulative throughout the
entire period?

2.

The pro I iferation of projectile point styles during this
period and the great ranges of morphological variation within
types has been noted in the preceding chapter.
Does this
variation reflect cultural or physical entities and, if so,
are they contemporaneous or sequential or both at different
times and places?
How do the ranges of the various groups
over I ie the Central Brazos region?
If these groups were
contemporaneous, to what degree are potential interactions
among them reflected in the material culture?

3.

The changes between the Paleoindian and the Early Archaic are
often related to broadening of the uti I ized resource base at
a time when the resources themselves were in a state of flux
(i.e.,, changing habitats and various species extinctions at
the end of the Pleistocene). What was the subsistence base
of these peoples, how different was it from Paleoindian
groups in the same area, and how much, if any, did it change
throughout the long duration of the Early Archaic Period? Is
there a correlation between such subsistence change and
deteriorating environments?

4.

It is generally accepted that these groups
maintained
elements
of
Paleoindian
culture while initiating the
progressive changes in their material culture that signal led
the adaptation to a new and broader resource base. Can a
theoretical model be constructed that predicts which elements
of culture are held longest or discarded first, and to what
degree is this a function of the changes 1n the resource
base?

46-5

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS

Middle Archaic
The lack of knowledge of the Middle Archaic of the Central Brazos
region is in marked contrast to the enormous amount of archeological
work that has been done in sites of this period in Central Texas.
It
is possible that more Middle Archaic burned rock middens have been
excavated than any other single site type in Central Texas, and,
despite their stratigraphic complexity, a great deal is known about
the Middle Archaic in that region.
In the Central Brazos region,
however, where burned rock middens are al I but absent, and the typical
Middle Archaic artifacts of Central Texas are either very rare,
missing altogether or existing in an extreme variant form, there have
The paucity of identifiable
been almost no local investigations.
Middle
Archaic artifact forms is a serious impediment to the
understanding of the Central Brazos cultures dating to this period.
Perhaps more than any other period, basic stratigraphic excavations
are needed to formalize the regional chronology.

1.

While there is evidence for relatively extensive contact with
Central Texas during the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic
seems to mark a period of some isolation from Central Texas
culture influences.
Is this apparent isolation a physical
reality, reflecting occupation by groups whose ranges show
I ittle overlap, or could it be, as in the case of variant
artifact types, a reflection of artifact assemblages being
modified to match the particular resources or raw materials
avai I able within the region? Does this apparent isolation
continue undiminished throughout the entire period? Where is
the frontier during this period and what do sites along this
boundary look I ike? Are there sites with mixed assemblages
from both regions or separate sites in distinct locales?

2.

It has been stated throughout this report that burned rock
middens are essentially absent north of the Brazos River in
the Central Brazos region.
Is this
absence
a
real
phenomenon, or simply a matter of visibi I ity? What is the
actual distribution of burned rock middens in northeastern
Central Texas, particularly along the margin of that area?
Does their distribution correspond with some particular
resource distribution, or can it be argued that they are
scattered along a purely cultural boundary?

46-6

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
3.

The presence of Carrol lton-1 ike projectile points in the
Aqui I la Lake area along with some, but not al I, of the
reported diagnostics of the Carrol I ton focus, raises some
interesting questions.
Are the Carrol I ton points in this
area contemporaneous with the similar Bulverde type? If they
are, what does this imply in cultural terms:
similar
cultural adaptations, extensive contact, or the same group
attempting to manufacture the same projectile point from
smaller cores of generally poorer grades of chert?
Whatever
the type of boundary to the south, what are the implications
of the apparently wide distribution of the square stemmed
projectile point during this period, and if it represents a
broad diffusion of cultural traits, whence does it originate
and is there a corresponding time lag in such a diffusion?

4.

Weir (1976) has postulated an increased population and a
greater degree of social organization during this period 1n
Central Texas and, at least during the later portion, there
are some potentially rather dramatic developments in social
organization in other parts of the country, such as at
Poverty Point in Louisiana. What is the impact, if any, of
such developments on the cultures of the Central Brazos
region?
Late Archaic

Although one could hardly characterize the Late Archaic of the
Central Brazos as wel I known, it is, after the Late Prehistoric,
perhaps the best known in a general sense. Uni ike the Middle Archaic,
a number of diagnostic artifacts can definitely be I inked to this
period and their distributions traced across the region to some
degree.
In spite of this, or perhaps because of it, the Late Archaic
presents a complex pattern of local developments interspersed with
extra-regional trends from al I directions. The Late Archaic of the
Central Brazos affords the archeologist an excel lent study area for
the investigation of cultural developments related to, but occurring
on the fringe of, the development of more complex societies in the
southeastern United States. Careful consideration of the nuances of
cultural development in the Central Brazos may lead to a better
understanding of how, why and where sedentism does and does not
develop. Before such a study wi I I be possible, however, tighter
chronological and spatial control is needed on the confusing multitude
of Late Archaic diagnostics.

46-7

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
1.

A pro I iferation of projectile points thought to date to this
period has been interpreted here and elsewhere as an increase
in population during this period. Does this increase reflect
increased population over a larger area and correspondingly
greater uti I ization of the Aqui I la Lake area, or does it
indicate larger locally resident populations with smaller
resource procurement areas? Does increased population relate
to a general cumulative trend, indicative of long term
successful procurement strategies, to the local development
of better strategies for the exploitation of the traditional
resource base, or to the actual broadening of the uti I ized
resource base itself?

2.

Along with the apparent increase in the total number of
diagnostic projectile points, there seems to be an expansion
of the number of different types present in the region at
this
time, a trend perhaps not uni ike that witnessed
elsewhere in Central Texas.
Do these types indicate the
development of specialized tool kits by the same people or do
they reflect an increase in the number of distinct groups or
bands using the area at this time? If this is a reflection
of an augmented number of social groups, does it represent a
fragmentation of social groups because the limits of the
abi I ities of the social organization to deal with large
populations had been reached?
Or does it reflect some
breakdown and disintegration of the existing social systems,
due to either population pressures or climatic stress?

3.

During this period there 1s a rather complex mix
of
diagnostic projectile point types that can be linked to
Central and East Texas cultural areas, as wel I as some that
appear to be of local or1g1n. Does this mix represent a
number of brief sequential phases during which the Central
Brazos becomes first part of one, then another, cultural area
or does it represent contemporaneous use by local and
extra-regional groups from several areas? Are group ranges
throughout the area and even across the state so different at
this time that the classic boundaries of the state's culture
areas are no longer a useful concept?
Is increased social
fragmentation
and
perhaps
intergroup
competition for
resources potentially related to the rise of conditions ideal
for the development of complex societies in some parts of the
state?

4.

During the period usually regarded as Late Archaic in Central
Texas and the Central Brazos region, early ceramic cultures
such as Fourche Maline, Tchefuncte and Marksvi I le-Troyvi I le
are 1n ful I swing to the east and northeast. Diagnostic

46-8

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
projectile points suggest that there are at least some
cultural similarities with these areas. What is the extent
of such potential interaction with these developing cultures?
Is there ever an early ceramic period in the Central Brazos
area, or do ceramics arrive first during the early Caddo
Period?
Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric is by far the best known of al I aboriginal
occupation periods.
In fact, the original definition of the two
phases of the Late Prehistoric was made primarily on the basis of
excavations at Kyle Rockshelter and other sites along the Brazos in
this area. Excavations at other Late Prehistoric sites 1n Central
Texas have helped to refine ideas of these two phases, but the
original definition has been found to be substantially correct.
Additionally, a considerable amount of work, albeit done by amateurs
and/or unpublished, has been done at sites that reflected the "third
Late Prehistoric phase" in the area; the Caddoan intrusions. Despite
the enormous potential interest of group interactions during this
period, the relationship among these cultural groups is far from being
wel I understood.

1.

The original definition of the two Late Prehistoric phases
implied that Caddoan ceramics were intrusive. While they may
be intrusive into the artifact assemblages of the typical
Austin and Toyah phase cultures, there is increasing evidence
that the Central Brazos region contains an assemblage within
which the Caddo ceramics are not intrusive.
Does this
assemblage represent a locally resident group, and if so,
what is its relationship to more fully developed Caddo
cultures to the east?
Are there trade networks, kinship
ties, political al I iances or religious affiliations?

2.

The old question of Late Prehistoric cultural succession 1s
perhaps as relevant here, if not more so, as it is anywhere
else in Texas. Was there a gradual transition between the
Late Archaic and Austin phase people, marked primarily by a
single technological introduction, the bow and arrow, or were
there more substantial cultural changes I inked to developing
cultures in surrounding regions? Did the Toyah phase replace
the Austin phase completely and rather suddenly, and, if so,
what kind of interactions can be documented between these two
cultural traditions?
And what is the relationship of these
populations to the Caddo tradition to the east?

46-9

RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
3.

Comparisons based on either number of sites or total number
of projectile points seem to suggest some, albeit difficult
to quantify, decrease in population from the Late Archaic to
the Late Prehistoric.
Is this a real phenomenon or an
artifact of geomorphology, or changing social organization
and settlement patterns?
Is this decrease a continuing
trend, or is it related to one or more brief events of
depopulation
from
either
cultural
or
environmental
influences?

4.

After the Middle Archaic, when the Central Brazos region may
have been a part of a relatively smal I cultural interaction
sphere, and the Late Archaic, when the area may have been
occupied and used by a number of highly fragmented cultural
traditions, the Late Prehistoric is witness once again to
very widespread cultural traditions.
Do these cultures
spring ful I blown into the entire region, or is there a
center of origin and a corresponding time lag in diffusion?
Are these widespread cultures an accident of historical
development, or are there necessary preconditions of social
organization, or environmental abundance or scarcity that
must be met for such an occurrence?

RESEARCH ORIENTATIONS
The foregoing are only a few of an essentially endless set of
potential questions. The few I isted here are thought to be generally
soluble with data avai I able from surviving unexcavated sites in the
region, and in some cases, with the careful analysis of data from
previously excavated sites. For the most part, al I of these questions
wi I I require a synthetic approach, necessitating the analysis of a
number of sites, some within and some exterior to the Central Brazos
region.
The most serious problems facing archeology are not the kind
that can be solved by the excavation of any particular site.
Many of these questions wi I I require a multidimensional approach
to the data avai I able. The excavation of any specific site or sites
may often require the complementary re-analysis of older excavation
collections or the examination of local individual collections. An
important corollary of this is that both archeological contractors and
contracting agencies must recognize the need for such research and
insure its properly funded inclusion in major research projects.
It
must be emphasized that to fully realize the spirit of cultural
resource mitigation excavations, it may be advantageous to eliminate
the consideration of one or two questionable sites 1n favor of the
comparative re-analysis of an older collection.
As an example at

46-10

hand, it probably would have been much more useful to drop excavation
and/or analysis at Aqui I la sites with apparently mixed components,
such as the Bailey Site or 41HI125, in favor of the comparative study
of Late Prehistoric materials from sites outside of the reservoir
area, such as Asa Warner and Chupek, to provide a better regional
cohtext for the analysis of materials from the McDonald Site.
Excavation plans for sites cannot simply be grandiose sondage
programs.
Larger areas must be excavated where possib1e, even at the
expense of greatly reducing the total number of sites that may be
excavated.
Such excavations must be geared to the most minute
horizontal and vertical nuances of cultural variation. Data collected
cannot be I imited to artifacts only. Every attempt should be made to
assess the potential for the preservation of various types of
ecological data before excavation, and adequate samples should be
collected. The analysis of such samples should be firmly fixed in
every excavation budget. In the long run, the collection and analysis
of this subsidiary data may prove to be much more rewarding than
traditional
archeological
analyses.
Recognizing
this,
both
contractors and agencies should be flexible enough to make trade offs
to gather the most cultural information possible. To use another
example from Aqui I la Lake, the analysis of local clays and sherds from
within and without the reservoir area might be of much greater use
than the determination of primary, secondary and tertiary flake types
from mixed sites.
An effective research design requires the prioritization of
sites. Al I sites cannot be excavated, nor can al I endangered sites be
saved. Although the Central Brazos region is not subjected to the
extreme pressures of some of the fossi I fuel mining regions of Texas,
sites are nonetheless being destroyed at a rapid rate. Only a few of
the best can be saved. What is emphasized here is an approach that
max1m1zes potential from a few excel lent sites, while sacrificing
questionable ones.
The uti I ization of a specific project oriented
research design can be useful in determining such priorities, but care
should be taken not to let a rigid research design force the
excavation of questionable sites while wel I preserved sites not
related to the design are al lowed to be destroyed.

Therefore
not al I possible study periods and time frames are
addressed. The area addressed here 1s Hi I I County and bordering
counties.
However, some of the questions could be applied to much
larger regions. The fol lowing is a I ist of the study units, each

The derived hypotheses do not fully exploit the data that might be
expected.
These propositions are testable, but their secondary
function 1s to give a structure and purpose to future data gathering
efforts.

47-1

HISTORIC RESEARCH DESIGN
GENERAL THEORETICAL FOCUS
The basic model for the fol lowing regional research designs 1s
cultural-historical, concentrating on the sequence of what happened to
whom and when. The interpretive model is concerned with cultural
evolution, with energy usage and organization as the chief indicators
of advancement. This theoretical orientation depends to a major
degree on the work of Leslie White (1943) and Richard N. Adams (1975,
1982) .
The White theory of cultural evolution held that the use of
energy, specifically the harnessing of non-human energy, was the best
single index to the levels of civi I ization. Expressed simply, hunter
gatherers used only the energy of the human body, fueled by the stored
solar energy in the plants and animals composing an individual diet.
The initial advance to the agricultural stage is marked by the
intentional storage of food, using chiefly wood heat to transform clay
into pottery, seeds into bread, meat into jerky and the I ike. Also,
bits of land that offer optimal growing conditions are cultivated
through a more intense use of human power. This stage of civi I ization
might be thought of as the hoe cultivation stage.
The next stage
involves the harnessing of animal power to increase the energy input.
This would then advance to plow agriculture. In some special cases,
such as the adaptation of the Great Plains hunters to horses imported
by the Spanish, the increased animal power might be used to enhance
the hunter gatherer I ifeway.
Thus the primary view of the cultural process is one of ever
increasing energy use. The fol lowing hypotheses are not intended to
be based on the use of archeological data alone.
Neither are they
presented as anything more than a beginning. Should they prove to be
fruitful, they wi I I produce more questions and counterarguments than
answers.
HISTORIC INDIANS
Early Contact Period 1500-1700
The historical sources are almost silent on the occupation of the
Upper Brazos region during the early contact period. Indeed, it has
never been firmly established that there was any identifiable cultural
group in this area at that time. Watson noted a stratum of bison bone
and debitage at the McDonald Site (Chapter 38) that lay above the Late
Prehistoric occupation, but this stratum could not be dated.

47-2

HISTORIC RESEARCH DESIGN
The region rs bisected by the I ine which delineates the contact
interface between the Northeastern Caddoan and West Gulf Coast
cultural regions. There is abundant evidence of Historic Indian
occupations in the region after 1700, but these groups are known to
have been living in other areas when first contacted by LaHarpe in
1719.
The major question is whether these Wichita-related groups
moved into unoccupied territory or if they displaced some earlier
occupants.
The Bedai are known to have occupied a vi I lage within two
leagues of the Spanish pueblo, Nuestra Senora Del Pilar de Bucareli
(Sorrow 1972:7) in the 1770s. There may have been a remnant of this
group under Chief "Bead-Eye" (Kirkpatrick 1963) who were I iving with
the Anadarko in Jose Maria>s vi I I age on the Brazos in the nineteenth
century. The Bedai are not identified archeological ly. The site of
Bucarel i is probably in Madison County near where State Highway 21
crosses the Trinity River. This was where it was placed by Bolton
(1915:406).
In the eighteenth century the Bedai were living in
Walker, Madison and Trinity counties on both sides of the Trinity
River.
It was said that they spoke a Caddoan dialect, were
confederates of the Hasinai, and considered themselves the original
occupants of this area (Webb 1952:155). Nevertheless, this occupation
could have been influenced by the influx of the Wichita from the north
1n the first quarter of the eighteenth century.
In summary, the early contact period is very poorly known in the
Upper Brazos region. The historical sources are fairly informative of
the location and composition of native groups after 1700.
Therefore,
although one might expect to find some intrusive European trade goods
to show contact, any archeological site relating to these times would
have to be treated as protohistoric, because of the poverty of the
historic record.
EXPECTED RESOURCE TYPES
1.

The archeological remains of both large base camp vi I !ages
and temporary hunting camps with either European trade goods
or other means of dating the site to this period.

2.

Aboriginal cemeteries dating from this era.

3.

Single ephemeral components of late aboriginal deposits that
overlay prehistoric deposits in sites that were so favorably
located as to be occupied repeatedly over a long period of
time, such as the McDonald S~te.

47-3

HISTORIC RESEARCH DESIGN
DATA GAPS
As outlined above, the historic record contains I ittle about the
composition and location of native groups in this area before 1719.
The Spanish expeditions to east Texas generally confined themselves to
routes along the Camino Real between San Antonio and Nacogdoches.
This route passes wel I to the south of the region considered here. In
addition, there have been relatively few historic Indian sites
identified that can be dated to the early contact period. A number of
sites dating to the late contact period are discussed in the next
section.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Hypothesis lÂ·
The region was thinly settled by
Henrietta focus during the early contact period.

people

of

the

Test Imp I ications:
Perhaps this hypothesis should be negatively
stated; the region was not occupied to any significant degree by
any cultural group between 1500 and 1700.
The Henrietta focus
was I ikely limited to the region of north central Texas along the
Red River. A I imited number of radiocarbon dates suggests that
these Wichita groups were I iving in lexas as early as the
fifteenth century. The finding of at least one site of similar
character in this region would tend to support the hypothesis.
Hypothesis~-

Native peoples of the early contact period tn the
region were decimated by the first onslaught of European diseases
and the survivors fled north to the Red River region.

Test Imp I ications: The finding of cemeteries that show large numbers
of burials within a short time frame datable to the early contact
period would support this hypothesis.
Analysis of skeletal
material which would suggest that a similar disease caused
multiple deaths over a short time would also tend to support the
proposition. Settlement pattern analysis which tended to suggest
larger populations in the Late Prehistoric and a falling or
absent population during the early contact period would also
supply some support but would not be evidence for epidemic
disease as a primary causative factor.
Hypothesis 3. European trade goods were not encountered by the native
peoples of this region unti I the eighteenth century.
Test Imp I ications: The finding of at least one artifact of clearly
European origin in a site that could be firmly dated to the
seventeenth century or earlier would be sufficient to negate this
hypothesis.

47-4

HISTORIC RESEARCH DESIGN
Hypothesis _i. The native peoples of the region first began to use the
horse during the early contact period.
This changed their
economy from settled agriculture with mixed game hunting to one
of duality with a distinct season of horseborn bison hunting.
Test Implications: Apart from the obvious evidence of horse bones
found at sites with other cultural materials dated within the
early contact period, most evidence would be indirect. It would
be more I ikely that bison bones, particularly those that a hunter
on foot might leave at the ki I I site, would appear in the refuse
of large camps. They would also be more frequently found in the
refuse of the larger agricultural vi I I ages as hunters were able
to range further away and bring back quantities of bison meat on
horseback. The evidence would consist of larger amounts of
non-local materials found at each site. Conversely, the finding
of the remains of clearly domestic food plants in temporary
hunting camps together with evidence of brief occupation would
imply the abi I ity of the hunters to carry prov1s1ons away from
the home vi I Iages in greater quantities using horses than they
would be able to carry on their person.
Hypothesis~Â·

The uti I ization of wi Id plant foods 1n
decreased after the introduction of the horse.

Imp I ications:
The evidence here would be based on plant
materials
found in flotation samples taken from temporary
campsites that could be firmly dated to the early contact period,
and contrasting the species with those found in Late Prehistoric
sites of a similar nature in the same region.

Hypothesis 6. The Prehistoric Toyah focus people continued to fol low
their I ifeway wel I into historic times, perhaps as late as 1750,
without significant change.
Test Imp I ications: The Toyah phase in the Central Brazos region 1s
wel I
defined archeological ly.
The characteristic artifacts
include Perdiz arrow point, Friday knife, flake dri I I, Leon Plain
pottery,
and some, perhaps superimposed, Caddoan decorated
pottery. The stone tool assemblage relates to the more southerly
portions of central Texas, while the pottery, some of which may
be locally made, relates to the eastern portions of the state.
The
identification of a distinctly Toyah phase site with
associated European trade goods of the late seventeenth or early
eighteenth century would tend to support this hypothesis. As
stated, the hypothesis would be difficult to refute except with
negative evidence that no such sites were found.

47-5

HISTORIC RESEARCH DESIGN
Late Contact Period 1700-1800
The late contact period is much better recorded 1n historical
documents than the early contact period. The migration of the Wichita
from the area of the Canadian River, where they were visited by
LaHarpe in 1719, to the region around Hi I I County in the middle of the
eighteenth century (Bolton 1915:36) has been documented.
French
traders were reported as doing business with the Tawakoni, Tonkawa and
other groups soon after the founding of New Orleans in 1718.
The
Spanish had a briefly occupied town from 1774 to 1779 on the Trinity
River somewhat south of the region defined here, but they documented
contacts with a number of native peoples who I ived to the north of
them.
A number of Indian groups are known to have retreated before the
advancing frontier and taken up brief residence in Hi I I and the
surrounding counties during the nineteenth century.
Wichita-related
groups are known to have occupied a portion of this region in the
eighteenth century and a number of sites have been identified as
having been associated with these people. The Gas Plant site (41ML1),
just south of the center of Waco on the east bank of the Brazos River,
has been identified as a Waco or Tawakoni vi I I age occupied between
1770 and 1830. The Stone Site, north of Waco on the west bank of the
Brazos, is associated with some Wichita group in the eighteenth
century (Story 1985).
The Vinson Site in Limestone County on
Techuacana Creek is a Wichita vi I I age dating from 1750 to 1825. The
Stansbury Site, now under Lake Whitney in Hi II County, is thought to
have been the eighteenth century Flechado vi I I age occupied by the
Tawakoni (Stevenson 1970:58-111, 277-284).
EXPECTED RESOURCE TYPES
1.

Vi I I ages and smal I hamlets of the Kichai, Tawakoni and
perhaps Tonkawa tribes are to be expected. One Tonkawa
vi I I age visited by de Mezieres has been placed in northwest
Limestone County near the town of Tehuacana (Lorraine 1963).

2.

More ephemeral hunting camps, or shallow components in older,
often-visited campsites.

3.

Cemeteries.

DATA GAPS
Not al I of the vi I lages occupied by native peoples during the
eighteenth century were visited by the Spanish and classified as to

remnant fami I ies from several sources. There has not yet been a set
of characteristics devised to distinguish between various Wichita
groups and the Tonkawa in an archeological context.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Hypothesis_!. The Tawakoni 's migration from the Canadian River area
to central Texas increased their access to French trade goods.
Test Imp I ications: The frequency and variety of European trade goods
in Texas sites should be greater than that found in Canadian
River sites and the frequency should increase over time.
Hypothesis 2. The Kichai migration from the north central region
along the Red River occurred at the same time as the Tawakoni
withdrawal from the Canadian River area.
Test Imp I ications: Both archeological and archival information can
help answer this question and could lead to queries about the
motive for the southward moves.
Was it the attraction of
European trade goods or the pressure exerted by other Plains
tribes?
Hypothesis~Â·

The eighteenth century Tawakoni and Kichai groups had
begun the process of acculturation and do not retain al I of the
characteristics that can be identified in the archeological
material from the Henrietta focus sites or the Canadian River
sites.

Test Imp I ications: The number of confirmed Wichita sites in Texas 1s
actually
rather smal I, indicating that many remain to be
identified in the field. These sites are thought to represent
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
century
habitations
of
the
Wichita-related groups. The test of this hypothesis rests on a
comparison of the material culture in these two foci to establish
the persistence, or the disappearance, of culturally distinctive
traits.
Subsistence habits, established through floral and
faunal materials for example, should be an area for this test.
The nature of the vi I Iage house should also be informative. Did
the Wichita continue to bui Id the same type of conical grass
covered house that Coronado saw in Kansas and LaHarpe saw on the
Canadian, or did they adopt a more portable skin shelter?

47-7

HISTORIC RESEARCH DESIGN
EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT
Introduction
The European settlement of this region did not begin unti I
the nineteenth century.
Hi I I County and those counties that
border it appear to have no significant resources for study unti I
after 1836. The Period One study units as defined in RP3 do not
include areas of any of the subject counties.
After the Texas Revolution, settlement was more rapid
although the region was sti I I largely a frontier at the outbreak
of the Ci vi I War.
This is a period rich in the significant changes 1n energy
usage and organization that formed the modern rural society.
From the theoretical viewpoint of increased energy usage as a
major index to the complexity of social organization, there is at
least one major catalyst of change during this short time frame,
perhaps two.
The coming of the rai I road to the Cross Timbers
region after the Ci vi I War had a major effect on agriculture.
Also significant was the transition away from slave labor to the
mechanized commercial organization of agriculture as a highly
competitive enterprise, using animal and machine produced energy
and reducing the direct human work input. These two developments
are
not separate, but represent two aspects of the same
phenomenon, the industrialization of agriculture.
The Afro-American (Black) portion of the subdivided research
design is focused primarily on the transition from slavery, but
none of these study units can be neatly trimmed off from their
relationships with the others. The dominant group, in terms of
political control, was the Anglo element, but both Blacks and
German immigrants contributed to the cultural development of the
region.
Upper South and Lower South Settlement
The maps which define the Upper South and the Lower South
study units in RP3 (Brown et al. 1982:66, 68) show that the
region is bisected by the boundary between these study units.
Limestone and Navarro counties are included in the Lower South,
while Hi I I, Mclennan, Bosque, Johnson and El I is counties are
shown in the Upper South. This portion of the research design
wi I I address both groups, with an emphasis on the contrasts
between the material culture and settlement patterns of the two
traditions. Settlers wi I I not have adhered to the arbitrary I ine
drawn by cultural geographers, but wi I I have settled the region

47-8

HISTORIC RESEARCH DESIGN
in a mixed manner with perhaps more Upper South peoples in the
northern and western portions and fewer in the southern and
eastern sections. The contrasts between these two would appear
to be the primary broad cultural contrast avai Iable.
The Lower South tradition has seemed to be oriented toward
the growing of cash crops with slave labor, with contrasts
between the planter class and al I others 1n terms of material
culture.
The planter homestead would be expected to contain
large proportions of European chinaware and other prestige goods,
while the slave and even the overseer's quarters would evidence
more modest material possessions. The primary mode of analysis
suggested is that of investigating the means by which the human
energy of slaves was replaced by mechanical devices and animal

successful in keeping the owners of large plantations wealthy?
The primary energy input in this system is solar. The more land
you have the more solar energy you can trap, but other work, such
as plowing, must be performed in order to realize the maximum
gain from that energy input.
Cotton picking is particularly
labor intensive. Without the human labor to pick the cotton and
haul it to the gin, no profit would be realized from a
plantation.
Were other less labor intensive crops adopted for
this reason?
The Upper South immigrants sprang from a background formed
largely in the backwoods of the Carolinas during the eighteenth
century. They were essentially subsistence farmers and their
technology included the stone quern, spinning wheel, horse
collar, four heeled wagon and heavy plow.
The combination of
this
simple tool kit and a tradition of self sufficient
subsistence farming al lowed these people to take possession of
the virgin lands of the frontier, prosper and multiply. Even
when they became wealthy, they seem to have been reluctant to
display their material means to any great degree. Some continued
to I ive modestly in simple dog-trot cabins or one and a half
story frame homes.
One of the questions that arises from this
phenomenon is whether the influence of evangelical frontier
Christianity, which discouraged ostentation, was the primary
influence, or whether the custom had deeper roots in the
resentment of a peasant class for the gentry. Certainly the
prosperous yeoman farmers considered ostentation not only a
waste, but sinful.
These contrasting social attitudes may
contain some keys to the social roots of similar attitudes in our
own society.

DATA GAPS
The data gaps reflect the fact that the more elite and prosperous
were the record keepers and makers. The modest farmer seldom got his
name into the local newspaper or into the deed records of the county
clerk.
In particular, the post-Ci vi I War tenant farmer was sometimes
only found by chance by the census taker. It is almost impossible to
trace a family that leaves a county unless there is some documentary
clue as to where they went. Even then the work and research involved
1n running down several moved fami I ies in as many other counties is

The essential data are:

expended in transporting them from their place of origin to the
site must be considered. Indications of the changing methods of
farming, where machine and animal power was substituted for human
effort, should also be present in the archeological record.
Hypothesis~Â·

Certain elements of the Upper South cultural group,
associated with evangelical church membership, continued to cling
to the older subsistence farming I ifeway wel I into the twentieth
century.

HISTORIC RESEARCH DESIGN

Test

Imp I ications:
The characteristics of settlement and
farm
practice defined by Jordan (1966) form the core of the elements
to be used in testing this hypothesis.
The characteristics
expected are a more conservative use of energy, fewer commercial
artifacts and less reliance on cash crops.
The pre-rai I road settlement pattern was characterized
by a single county seat with large numbers of smal I dispersed
hamlets providing a neighborhood focus for the rural population.
The post-rai I road settlement pattern was characterized by the
growth of highly centralized smal I towns along the rai I right-of
-way.

Hypothesis~Â·

Test Imp I ications: Some of the dispersed hamlets wi I I have been
abandoned and moved to the rai I road, much as the hamlet at
Patten's Mi I I became the rai I road town of Aqui I la. The town of
Peoria, on the other hand, retains not only it's Cumberland
Presbyterian (1853) Church, but is distinctly dispersed.
Other
hamlets, such as Lexington, seem to have disappeared without a
trace. The Hickey Cemetery is the only central place function
that remains of the hamlet where Hi I I County was officially
formed. Oscar Lewis observed that the nineteenth century common
school
districts
often
defined
the natural neighborhood
boundaries that marked these dispersed hamlet centers, and that
the school often provided a central focus for community affairs
(Lewis 1948:42).
The Afro-American Study Unit
This study unit was defined spatially and temporally tn Brown et
al. (1982:69-70).
Temporally it starts in 1803, largely ignoring any
Black influence on the Spanish era.
In 1803, Black slaves were
introduced into Texas by Anglo settlers. The spatial distribution of
this study area encompasses roughly the eastern third of the state as
defined by Brown et al. (1982:70). The Upper Brazos region design
fat Is on the western fringe of that large area. Black settlement had
not advanced very far beyond Hi I I County when the Ci vi I War broke out
and ended slavery. There were, nevertheless, a number of slaves
I iving in the county at the time of emancipation. The 1860 census
shows 120 slave owners in Hi I I County with a total of 650 slaves.
In
1880 the Black population of the county had grown to 2551. It would
be expected that the surrounding counties would exhibit similar
demographic patterns. Thus, the cultural remains relating to slavery
and the Reconstruction period would be present, but rather sparse.

HISTORIC RESEARCH DESIGN
There were very few large slave owners in this region and those
were engaged in a number of diverse operations, not the single crop
cotton economy.
The operations of Col.
James J. Gathings (see
Jackson 1982) in particular, suggest that the Antebellum Black
population in this region may have had a large number of ski I led
artisans who had some influence on the prosperity of the freedman
groups after the war. Black cowboys, implied by the operations of
E.C .. Zol I icoffer who I ived on Ash Creek, would also suggest that the
working ski I Is of the Black family heads in this region might differ
from the smal I farmer/sharecropper norms defined in areas to the east.
EXPECTED RESOURCE TYPES
1.

Smal I plantations, now marked by the ruins of modest homes
that once employed a few slaves. The Anderson Cabin 1s an
example of this sort of plantation.

2.

Larger Antebellum slave-run industries and workshops.
These
are known to cluster around the town of Covington. There may
be other such instances in the region.

3.

Single family sharecropper farmsteads that can be shown to
have been the homes of Black fami I ies during Reconstruction
and later.

4.

Smal 1, almost exclusively Black communities.

5.

Black churches.

6.

Black cemeteries.

7.

The sites of former segregated Black schools.

DATA GAPS
It is often difficult, if not impossible, to make the connection
between the Black population in the 1860 and 1870 census. The records
of the Freedman's Bureau can be of some help as can the WPA slave
narratives, but both are generally poorly indexed for this purpose.
This leaves certain questions about the transition from slave to free
status very difficult to answer. The presumption normally made is
that Blacks were not very mobile after the war and that many continued
to I ive and work within the same general area. Wiener (1978) has
produced data that suggests that the old planter elite may have
continued to survive and dominate both political and economic I ife
after Reconstruction.

SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Hypothesis.!.Â· The variety and ski I I levels of the tasks assigned to
slaves in the frontier areas of Texas was greater than the
traditional field hand/house servant roles common to the great
cotton growing areas.
Test Imp I ications: Short of excavations in Covington or the other
large slave-owning establishments, the best indication of this
variety of ski I Is might be expected in the tools and other
implements not directly connected with farming, that are found in
the vicinity of sites known to have been occupied by Blacks in
the immediate postwar period.
Because tools are carefully
curated items, not subject to random discard, the best chance for
finding such would be in structures that burned. Therefore,
sites that show significant amounts of charcoal should be
considered prime candidates for this type of information.
Hypothesis~Â·

Large plantations offered share-crop contracts to
former slaves on parcels cut from the original holding as an
inducement to continued labor after emancipation.

established from the population schedules. These Black clusters

be related to the remains of structures, a useful comparison of
the material culture, economic success and relative efficiency of
the two races can be established.
A tentative method for
comparing the efficiency, in energy terms, of farms is developed
in Nightengale and Jackson (1983).

Hypothesis~Â·

The folk architecture of Blacks tends to favor the
shotgun house as defined by Vlach (1977) or a variation termed
the double shotgun (Jackson 1982:29, 41).

Test Implications: This hypothesis can be tested with data from
standing structures encountered on survey where the internal
arrangement of rooms and their relative dimensions can be
defined.
The so-cal led double shotgun house often looks, from
the exterior, I ike a common southern pyramidal or bungalow type
house. From the interior it can be established that these houses
consist of two units that do not communicate internally, but
share a common 'front and rear porch. The shotgun house can be
recognized in foundations and other slight archeological remains
if there is an indication that the front and rear entrances were
in the narrow gable ends of the structure. Flagstone walks and

relict 1r1s path borders wi I I sometimes supply such clues. The
establishment of the ethnicity of the bui Ider/owner of such
houses
must fal I back on the county land records, local
informants and the census schedules.
Hypothesis~Â·

Rural hamlets, often kin-based, grew up to become
exclusively Black communities around farms of enterprising Blacks
1n an area where Anglo landowners sold smal I parcels to Black
families.

Test Imp I ications; Kirsten Mui len (1981:82) estimated that as many as
225 exclusively Black communities existed at one time in rural
Texas.
Such communities can be easily recognized if
the
prevailing architecture is distinctively ethnic.
The other
characteristic which seems to set these smal I hamlets apart from
similar settlements bui It by Anglos or Germans is their extremely
compact nature and rather smal I land parcels.
The physical
remains of structures must be supplemented by a detailed land
ownership history to establish the growth pattern, dates and
ethnic
identification
of
landowners.
The
elements
of
self-organization and the survival of distinctive African-derived
house forms are the matters of theoretical interest.
The German-American Study Unit
Uni ike the other study units in this chapter, the German American
study unit is already fully developed in the State Plan (Brown et
al. 1982:96ff). The population distribution map for 1880 (Brown et
al. 1982:110) indicates that there was a German-born minority in each
of the counties in question during the 1880 census.
Because of the
extraordinary stability of the German American fami I ies observed
elsewhere in the state is is expected that these nuclear groups have
very I ikely persisted and expanded.

DATA GAPS
The areas settled by Germans within the defined region are around
Malone in southern Hi I I County, around Womach in Bosque County and
around Tours and Moody in Mclennan County.
Except for a possible
grouping of second generation Wendish settlers mixed with Germans in
western Mclennan and Coryel I counties, the German element is isolated
in an integrated Anglo setting. Where second generation fami I ies are
involved, the 1880 census is the earliest which shows the place of
birth of the father and mother of each person recorded.
SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Hypothesis lÂ· Where significant numbers of German-born settlers were
present there are certain variations to the individual houses of
the folk tradition that can be traced to ethnic difference.
Test Implications: The very distinctive folk architectural types of
houses found in the German Hi I I Country of Gi I lespie County are
not expected. The contrast wi I I be between the adherence of the
rural
Anglos to a few defined house types and the more
imaginative and individualistic German-bui It homes.
Some homes
may exhibit an exterior stair to the loft, or enclosed stair wel I
that opens only onto the front porch.
Hypothesis _g. The ratio of oxen to horses was virtually the same
between the Anglo and the German farmers, but the number of oxen
declined significantly as agricultural machinery was introduced.
Test

Imp I ications:
Many of the farm machines invented 1n the
nineteenth century were specifically designed to be drawn by
horses, not oxen.
Therefore one would expect to find the
relative number of horses to oxen to increase after 1870.
Comparative differences between the German farmers and their
Anglo neighbors in a given area might tend to show which group
adopted the more energy intensive methods first.

Hypothesis~Â·

The wealthy German American farmer tended to display
his means more in the quantity of outbui Idings on his farmstead
than in expansion or elaboration of the residence.

Test Implications: This hypothesis can be tested with survey level
data and some data on th-e relative wealth of area farmers. If
the wealth figures are taken from the U.S.
census then care
should be taken not to count bui Idings that do not appear to be
at least as old as that census data. Because of restrictions on

ARCHEOLOGICAL RESEARCH GOALS: A FINAL SUMMARY

David 0. Brown

The fol lowing chapter discusses some of the data gathered during
the Aqui I la Lake project with respect to the research goals stated in
Chapter 7. As noted in that chapter, the diversity of approaches and
evolving goals of this multiyear archeological project have combined
to make the research design seem less than fully
integrated.
Nonetheless, al I of the original goals have been addressed to some
degree. The summaries below high I ight some of the more important
contributions of the project and provide a final synthesis of research
results. The discussion of these research goals is undertaken here in
the
reverse order they were first presented to emphasize the
importance of the first goals from Chapter 7.

1) TO DEVELOP A PRELIMINARY REGIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN FOR THE
CENTRAL BRAZOS REGION.
This goal was the primary focus of Watson's (1982) dissertation
and the results of his research are presented with some modifications
in Chapter 45. Although his regional research design stands wel I
alone,
a
supplementary
prehistoric
regional research design,
incorporating some of the information from the final season, was
written at the end of the final season. This second design, presented
in Chapter 46, should be taken as simply a different view of some of
the archeological problems faced in the Central Brazos region. It is
intended to be complementary, rather than in opposition to, the
research design by Watson. Also during the final season, a historic
research design, authored by the project historian, Jack Jackson, was
added (Chapter 47).
Although very little substantive historical
archeological research was conducted during the project, it was felt
necessary to at least address this issue in the compilation of a
complete research design.

48-1

FINAL SUMMARY
The development of a regional research design is a primary aid to
the integration of research within a particular area. Like most, the
one presented here is of necessity incomplete, selecting certain
aspects of prehistory for research at the expense of others. It is
not intended to replace the broader research design formulated by
Lynott (1977) for the whole of the North Central Texas area, but
rather to supplement that earlier design by narrowing the areal focus
and building upon it from the perspective of ten years of research in
the Aqui I la Lake area.
The need for, and potential importance of, regional research
designs are widely accepted, but inherent problems in the formulation
of such designs must not be ignored. Watson (Chapter 45) alludes to
some of the potential problems, particularly the necessary balance in
scope as discussed by Lynott (1977).
The problem of a poorly
formulated regional research design is compounded by designs that
might be difficult to operationalize or that might lack relevance to
the problems faced by the general archeological community. A regional
research design, no matter what its intended scope, is only as
effective as its implementation.
And since implementation depends
upon local archeologists, effectiveness is best assured by securing a
broad base of support from the local community when constructing such
a design.
Several considerations are important in the formulation of a
regional
research
design,
not the least of these being the
identification of a specific region. In the first place, the region
should, as in the case of aboriginal Central Texas (see Prewitt 1981),
show some indication of being a culture area rather than
an
arbitrarily, or even naturally, bounded area. The larger the regional
area, and the greater the ecological diversity contained therein, the
more difficult a problem this is. As Watson (Chapter 45) suggests, in
many cases, the larger the area, the more general the research design
wi I I necessarily be.
In some very large areas, only very broad
questions may apply. With smaller areas, specificity becomes more
practical. The problems facing research designs for smaller areas are
primarily the redundancy of questions between areas, and the possible
inabi I ity of any particular area by itself to answer a specific
question.
Obviously, there are few questions specific to the Aqui I la Lake
area which are not common to surrounding areas. For this reason, it
would make I ittle practical sense to write a specific research design
for Aqui I la Lake (at least not after the lake is already impounded).
Yet this brjngs up a very significant point; to what region does the
Aqui I la Lake area belong? Hi I I County has been included as part of
the Central Texas culture area by Prewitt (1981) and as part of the
North Central Texas culture area by Lynott (1977). Both authors and

48-2

FINAL SUMMARY
many others would probably agree that Hi I I County lies within a
transitional zone between Central and North Central (and even East)
Texas. Regional research designs applicable to either of these areas
would be I ikely to contain questions of importance to the Aqui Ila Lake
area, and possibly just as many
that
would
be
irrelevant.
Nonetheless, it should be possible to flag those research questions
within a particular region that apply to a larger or smaller unit.
While the research themes proposed by Brown (Chapter 46) are
primarily related to the specific culture historical problems of the
Central Brazos, Watson's regional research design (Chapter 45) divides
questions among substantive, technical, methodological and theoretical
issues. Jackson's design (Chapter 47), on the other hand, relates
broader regional questions to the smaller Central Brazos area.
Despite differences in orientation, al I three authors seek the
explanation of aspects of culture history and culture process in data
derived from the Central Brazos. The answers to these questions are
of relevance not only to the broader cultural regions of Texas, but
can be adapted to the understanding of general theoretical models of
culture process.
The specific questions addressed in these research designs wi I I
not be repeated here.
They are discussed in detai I by their
respective authors. What wil I be re-emphasized are some of the
management problems facing the area and some of the kinds of data that
are felt to be important in realizing the research questions.
At present in Texas, the most serious threats to archeological
resources are the state's continued rapid population growth and
increasing exploitation of it's widespread fossi I fuel reserves.
In
the Central Brazos, population growth means the continued spread of
urban centers such as Waco and the slow but steady growth of secondary
trade centers such as Hi I lsboro. In addition, continued spread of the
Dal las-Fort Worth metroplex wi I I probably increase the demand for
recreational
faci I ities
along the Brazos River and its maJor
tributaries, bringing new growth to resort communities such as those
at Lake Whitney. The destruction of archeological sites through urban
and suburban sprawl is one of the most frustrating
for
the
archeologist, because only rarely is funding avai Iable for the
examination of sites in such areas.
Recent trends, such as the
Veteran's Administration requ1r1ng archeological survey of large
housing tracts that utilize VA financing, and the increasing trend
toward conscious management of growth in urban areas, may prevent the
loss of some important sites in larger centers, but wi I I probably have
little
effect outside of them.
As in the past, professional
archeologists wi I I have to continue to rely upon, perhaps increasingly
so, their contacts among avocational archeologists to recover some
information from sites in areas unprotected by regulations.
48-3

FINAL SUMMARY
The appropriation of prime agricultural land through urban and
suburban
spread wi I I force the intensification of agricultural
activities 1n rema1n1ng areas and the use of lands previously
considered marginal, particularly in the somewhat sparsely populated
Cross Timbers region. Land clearing and the construction of Soi I
Conservation Service erosion control dams wi I I be potential hazards to
sites. Continued growth wi I I also spawn increased demand for water
and
wastewater
services,
with the associated construction of
reservoirs, water storage faci I ities and pipelines.
In the latter
case, both the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Texas Department
of Water Resources wi I I have
major
responsibi I ities
in
the
identification and management of potentially endangered archeological
sites.
Energy exploration and extraction are not as yet as important 1n
the Central Brazos as they are in other parts of Texas, but some oil
and gas reserves exist throughout the area and lignite exists in the
extreme southeastern portion.
Some dri I I ing was being conducted 1n
the Aquil la Lake project area and in and about Hi I I County prior to
the completion of the dam, and rising oi I prices or depletion of
currently avai I able reserves may open up these fields to ful I scale
exploitation.
Some types of archeological sites are, by their nature, extremely
important.
These include sites with minimal disturbance of spatial
relationships, sites with intact stratigraphic relationships and sites
with wel I preserved fauna I and floral remains. Every effort should be
made to seek out and preserve these sites that have high potential for
the recovery of significant information, whatever their age or
cultural affi I iation. Although these sites might occur anywhere, two
site types wi I I be most important in providing such information.
These are the buried floodplain site, such as the McDonald Site at
Aqui I la Lake, and the rockshelter, such as the Kyle Site at Lake
Whitney. High potential geomorphic locales, floodplains along major
streams and I imestone bluffs, should be surveyed with great care and
sites found there assessed very thoroughly. In addition unusual site
types, such as prehistoric sites with structural remains, or sites
with rare cultural or temporal aff i I iations, wi I I be important sources
of archeological data.
The creation of a research design, however, should al low the
construction of a framework for the analysis of data from less than
perfectly preserved sites. Specific research themes, such as the
occurrence of Granbury and Cliffton versus Seal lorn and Perdiz or the
occurrence of Folsom versus Brazos Fishtai I, or the distribution of
Caddoan ceramic motifs or burned rock middens, can be investigated on
a larger scale even if the individual site is destroyed. The research
themes provided 1n this report can be used to structure both the

48-4

FINAL SUMMARY
collection and analysis of data from al I sites in the region.
Even
data from private artifact collections can and should be integrated
into the research design. The emphasis on the analysis of data from a
broad range of site types should lessen the bias inherent in
investigation of only buried floodplain sites and rockshelters.
The regional research design provided here should be viewed as
only a preliminary model, open to revisions as fits the needs of
archeological problems and the nature of current impacts. A regional
conference or symposium involving both professionals and concerned
avocational archeologists would be an appropriate format for the
rev1s1on of the research design. Even so, no research design is ever
final. Problems change as new data is aquired, as do the interests of
individual researchers as theoretical paradigms evol~e. A prov1s1on
for continual update of the design is a critical necessity.

FROM SURFACE SCATTERS ON DISTURBED AND ERODED SITES.

DATA

RECOVERY

A large percentage of the sites investigated in the Aqui I la Lake
project are in the category of disturbed and eroded sites. Only the
floodplain sites and some of those on alluvial terraces do not fal I
within this group.
Many of the sites included in the I imited
assessment sites section are also disturbed and eroded, but in most
cases the collections were too I imited for an effective evaluation of
methodology. A few words on this group are in order, however, before
proceeding further.
Techniques of investigation used at the I imited assessment sites
were variable, ranging from shovel testing to backhoe trenching. Some
discussion is included on the varying successes of these methods 1n
the concluding portion of that section, but some of these are
reiterated here in the context of methodological examination.
In the first place, methods designed to work effectively on
disturbed and eroded sites may be worse than useless at other sites.
Thus, at sites in the alluvial bottoms, where I ittle or nothing is
exposed on the surface, surface collection may give a very skewed or
negative assessment of a deeply buried site.
By theÂ· same token,
subsurface tests that do not penetrate deeply enough into the cultural
strata to effectively evaluate the site may have the same effect.
Attempts at plowing the surface of 41HI106, for example, a site in a
potential alluvial context, may have biased the evaluation of that
site.
The handful of artifacts recovered in surface collecting the
plow furrows may not reflect the density and distrib~tion of possible
subsurface materials.
Likewise, the relatively shallow shovel tests
at 41HI122 may not have reached the depth where cultural materials
48-5

FINAL SUMMARY
could potentially be buried, particularly since many of the shovel
tests never penetrated beneath spoi I dirt from the excavation of the
trough silo.
Major surface collections were undertaken at two upland sites,
41HI109 and 41HI110, during the 1982 season and at two terrace sites
investigated during the 1980 season, 41HI74/114 and 41HI76.
These
latter two sites were originally intended as a model for maximal data
recovery from surface scatters, as described in the reseach design
chapter.
The sites were gridded into arbitrary 20 by 20 meter units
and a collection circle four meters in diameter was randomly placed
within each square. This type of sampling strategy is referred to by
Haggett (1965) as a stratified, systematic unaligned sample.
At both terrace sites, the total sample from surface collection
was smal I, hindering the interpretation of intrasite differences. At
41HI74/114, 150 specimens of I ithic debris, or 11.4% of the total 1317
specimens from the site, were recovered from 53 collection units. At
41HI76, the sample of 80 specimens of lithic debris from the surface
collection units comprised a slightly larger percentage of the total
588 specimens (13.6%) than at 41HI74/114.
As Watson (Chapter 32)
points out, only 19 of the 58 surface collection units at 41HI76
actually contained I ithic debris.
Two of these units, however,
contained 40% of the total surface I ithic sample, with the remarnrng
17 units containing only an average of 2.8 specimens per unit.
At both sites, therefore, the sample from any single surface
provenience 1s inadequate for intra-unit materials analysis and such
an analysis was not attempted. Instead, Watson combined al I surface
units for comparison to the excavated materials from that site. At
41HI74/114, he concluded that the surface and subsurface materials
supported the hypothesis that both groups were drawn from the same
population, with one exception: larger that expected percentages of
I ipped flakes in the subsurface group.
His suggestion that this
change may have been the result of changing biface technology from the
Archaic to the Late Prehistoric or the diminution of projectile point
size through time is not used to support separate dates for the
surface and subsurface components.
For 41HI76, the results were
almost identical: only the lower frequency of lipped flakes than
expected from the surface was found to be a significant relationship.
Although the comparison of surface to subsurface materials from
the sites did show some interesting patterns, the most potentially
interesting aspect of the data, the intrasite distribution of the
materials, had to be disregarded because of miniscule sample sizes
from the individual collection units.

48-6

FINAL SUMMARY
One solution to the problem would have been the collection of
much larger sampling areas. In any case, the low density of material
present at sites such as 41HI76 could have required collection of the
entire site to achieve statistically val id results. In light of this,
while some researchers (Berry 1962) have shown improved sample results
when using stratified, systematic unaligned sampling methods, others
(Plog 1976) have found that the stratified, systematic unaligned
approach sowed I ittle, if any, significant reduction in standard error
over simple random sampling, while both simple stratified
and
systematic sampling models showed increased efficiency.
In 1982, a different approach to the problem of
surface
collecting eroded and disturbed sites (see Chapter 10) was tried.
This seemingly rather arbitrary approach to surface collection, tested
at 41HI109 and 41HI110, basically involved the identification of site
areas that contained high frequencies of surface materials and the
collection of them in "natural" clusters. The primary assumption
underlying this method was that microareal differences in
the
surf icial distribution and density of artifactual materials were
who I ly a function of differential erosion rather than the residue from
any particular cultural activity or process. Thus, it was not the
collection square that was of primary importance but the sample from
within it, and the first concern was in the recovery of an adequate
sample of surficial material for analysis.
At sites with uniformly distributed I ithic debris, such as a
surface scatter in a plowed field, this method would clearly be
inappropriate. In such a case, adequate surface collection would be
obtained by varying the size of the collection area (prior to the
actual collection) unti I a sufficient quantity of materials could be
recovered.
At the McDonald hi I lside sites, uniform densities and
surf icial regularities were absent. Debitage was present primarily in
channeled eroded areas where its density had I ittle to do with what
might be present in the surrounding subsurface areas.
Samples of generally adequate size for analysis of potential
large scale intrasite patterning were obtained from both of these
sites, although the sample from 41HI110 was the better of the two. In
any case, the collection units were ultimately combined into site
areas (2 for 41HI109, 3 for 41HI110). At 41HI109, perhaps partially
because of the smaller sample size, few differences, none of them
significant, were noted between the north and south areas at the site.
At 41HI110, on the other hand, intra-areal differences in debitage
characteristics and 1n tool types suggested activity differences
between the areas.

48-7

FINAL SUMMARY
In their discussion of the role of surface assemblages 1n
archeological
research,
Lewarch and O'Brien (1981) stress the
importance of understanding the formation processes of
surface
assemblages.
Thus, surface assemblages exposed by some processes are
I ikely to more closely rep I icate subsurface assemblages than exposures
by other processes.
Although hi I Islope erosion, as present at the
hi I I side sites, can be
a
serious
altering
factor,
several
archeological attempts (Rick 1976; Flannery 1976; Synenki 1977) have
been unable to describe and quantify such disturbance.
3) TO EVALUATE SURFICIAL REMAINS FROM DISTURBED AND ERODED
AS INDICATORS OF PREHISTORIC ACTIVITIES.

SITES

As noted in the previous section, four sites, two from the 1980
and two from the 1982 season, yielded sufficiently large samples of
cultural materials for an attempt at analysis of remains from
disturbed and eroded sites. At two of these, 41HI74/114 and 41HI76,
the sample of material was stil I too smal I for a meaningful intrasite
activity area analysis.
At these two sites, the surface collected
debris was compared to materials from subsurface excavations. Results
of this analysis showed that the characteristics of the debitage from
both areas were essentially identical, with the exception that the
surface assemblages had lower than expected percentages of I ipped
flakes.
Watson interpreted this consistent
patterning
as
an
indication that the surface assemblages at both sites might represent
different I ithic technologies, or at least different sizes of tools
produced.
He suggested that this technological difference might be
attributable to the differences between Archaic and Late Prehistoric
occupations.
Unfortunately,
other
than specimens reported by
collectors, no Late Prehistoric diagnostics were indicated at either
site. And, at least at 41HI74/114, the stratigraphic argument is weak
since most of the surface collected materials came from other areas of
the site, rather than where the test pits were located.
Although intrasite patterning was investigated ~t both 41HI109
and 41HI110, only the latter of these two suggested the presence of
meaningful patterning. Analysis of the northern and southern areas of
41HI109 showed no significant differences, although the total sample,
particularly from the southern area, was smal I.
At
41HI110,
differences between the northern, southern and western areas were
thought to reflect activity patterning. It was hypothesized that the
western portion, which I ies on the edge of the Aqui I la Creek
floodplain, was primarily used for final stage I ithic manufacturing
and maintenance activities, while the northern and southern areas,
located farther from the floodplain and on the slopes of the hi I I side,
were uti Ii zed for initial stage reduction activities, or at least, a
more general purpose use.
48-8

FINAL SUMMARY
Test imp I ications were generated and the data examined. Although
the hypothesis was not uniformly supported in al I of the tests, the
weight of the evidence appeared to support it.
Even if this
patterning were definitely supported, its interpretation is somewhat
problematical. Did the separate areas represent single component
occupations
accidentally
separated
out from the multitude of
occupations which must have made up the site, or were these activities
confined to their separate areas over many years of occupations?
Although the fortuitous possibility of the former cannot be ruled
out, the latter suggestion seems more plausible. The western area,
marked by maintenance and final manufacturing activities, I ies on a

northern and southern areas, on the other hand, are less flat, farther
from the floodplain, and farther (at least in vertical distance) from
the smal I tributary drainage. In addition, these areas are closer to
I ithic raw materials occurring on the higher slopes and crest of the
hi I I side.

I ittle help in understanding the overal I cultural chronology of the
region or the placement of a particular site within its regional
context. Since many of the Aqui I la Lake sites are disturbed or
eroded, the development of any kind of functional or chronological
arrangement of sites necessitated the use of such sites.
The data
utilized from most of the sites, however, was from excavation
contexts, which are for the most part no less eroded or disturbed.
Only the four sites discussed in this section and the previous one
have significant surf icial components.
Two of these four sites, 41HI74/114 and 41HI76, are sti I I
represented primarily by materials from excavated contexts. Only
11.4% and 13.6%, respectively, of the total collection was from
surface proveniences.
It is reassuring to know that the analysis of
surface versus subsurface materials showed significant differences on
only one debitage characteristic: I ipping. On the other hand, the
overal I smal I size of either of these collections would have played
havoc with any intersite comparison of tool type frequencies since
relatively rare categories tend to be unevenly represented 1n smal I

samples.

48-9

FINAL SUMMARY

At the two upland sites investigated in 1982, most of the
material was recovered from the surface.
At 41HI109, a large
percentage was surficial, with only 13.7% from excavated contexts.
A
much larger excavated fraction was recovered from 41HI110, where
surface collection units yielded 65.3% of the total sample.
At both
sites, comparison of the surface versus subsurface materials showed
general similarities. The only exception to this is at 41HI110, where
both test pits showed higher percentages of burned flakes than found
on the surface.
Although neither of these two sites can be convincingly limited
to a single time period, they are analyzed with respect to their
overal I artifact assemblage and their functional role within the
sample of excavated sites from the Aqui I la Lake area. This analysis,
in Chapter 42, generally confirms the field hypothesis that these
sites were I ithic production centers, although, somewhat surprisingly,
41HI110 is found to associate more closely with other terrace sites on
some characteristics that with upland sites such as 41HI109. This may
be a function of the inclusion of the western or floodplain portion of
the site, which might be expected to show such similarities. On the
other hand, both 41HI109 and 41HI110 show some remarkable similarities
to the Reps Davis Site located on the modern floodplain adjacent to
Aqui I la Creek.
On the whole, the analysis of surface collected materials from
these disturbed sites shows them to be about as valuable for analysis
as any of the excavated sites that showed signs of being disturbed and
eroded.
Also, they provide a valuable comparison to less disturbed
sites, such as the Reps Davis or McDonald sites.
In fact, when
comparing sites on a microregional scale such as this, the mixed
components from the disturbed sites are no less difficult to deal with
than the combined cultural strata at undisturbed sites.

CONTACT

AND

EXCHANGE

Aboriginal contact and exchange in Texas are not new and untried
theories. During the Historic Period, the inland travels of Cabeza de
Vaca (Krieger 1961) and the incredible overland treks of Juan Sabeata
(Kelley 1955) suggest possible prehistoric para I lels. Evidence from
burial goods at the Al lens Creek Site in Austin County, among others,
suggests the long distance prehistoric transport of various materials
(Hal I 1981).

48-10

FINAL SUMMARY
Cherts, she I Is, ceramics, copper and galena - these may be onl~ a
fraction of what was actually traded.
Many likely trade items foodstuffs, hides, feathers and wooden artifacts
are only very
rarely preserved in sites. Unfortunately, at Aqui I la Lake not even
the traditionally imperishable items reflecting trade were recovered
from any of the sites.
It has been noted that at times during the Prehistoric Period the
Aqui I la Lake area participated in a larger cultural tradition, marked
by artifacts widely spread outside the area. Beginning in the Late
Archaic and continuing through the Late Prehistoric is one such period
of cultural contact, as evidenced by sharing of material culture
traits.
The evidence for some contact is clear.
It is unlikely that
either Gary dart points or Perdiz arrow points evolved independently
at Aqui I la Lake. However, since these items do not clearly reflect
cultural groups, the potential distances of contact or exchange remain
unknown. In some areas, chert sources provide evidence for the
distance
of movement (Reid 1984:202).
At Aqui I la Lake, field
observation of the material suggests the differences between Edwards
chert and Uvalde gravels are blurred since some of the Uvalde chert
may have its origin in the cretaceous deposits to the west.
Some
chert taken directly from the Edwards Formation may be present at some
of the Aqui I la sites, but it is difficult to be sure. If so, it would
probably be avai Iable in the Lake Whitney area, 15 miles away. Peter
(Chapter 31) has noted the presence of chert that appears to be from
Eastland County to the west (Peter, personal communication, 1982), but
the occurrence at Aqui I la is limited. A few projectile points from
the reservoir area are probably exotic, but it is difficult to I ink
them to any known source.
By far, the most important class of artifact documenting contact
with areas outside the Central Brazos region is pottery. While the
precise routes of pottery diffusion in the Central Brazos are sti I I
somewhat
unclear,
dating
to the latter portion of the Late
Prehistoric, a number of sites were found with ceramic vessels whose
design elements show commonalities with the Caddoan culture area. At
the Chupik Site (41ML44), northwest of Waco in Mclennan County, for
example, several ceramic types typical of the Alto focus, including
Pennington Punctated Incised, Dunkin Incised and Weches Fingernai I
Impressed, have been identified (Locke 1975). Locke also notes the
presence of engraved zig zag designs, similar to both ~ Fine
Engraved and Hickory Fine Engraved, at the Chupik Site.
At the Asa Warner Site (41ML46), southeast of Waco and also 1n
Mclennan County, Frank Watt (1956:23-8) identified several pottery
types, some which he states are primarily representative of the

Watt
1953) has described in more detai I the distribution and
diffusion of various types throughout the Brazos Valley. In addition
to these sites, several sites investigated in the Lake Whitney area
yielded ceramics exhibiting Caddoan design elements (Stephenson 1970).
Contrasted to sites such as the Kyle Site (Jelks 1962) where most
of the sherds recovered are from a single vessel, or the McDonald Site
where only a few vessels are present, are sites such as the Asa Warner
Site where the few sherds recovered represent more than a dozen
vessels (Watt 1956 and collections at TARL), and the Chupik Site,

latter site, the density of ceramics seems to suggest a vi I I age site,
or at least something more permanent than a short term hunting camp,
as wel I as more than casual interaction with the ceramic traditions of
East Texas.
Newel I and Krieger (1949:195) have suggested that the Chupik Site
is actually a vi I lage of Alto focus peoples.
Jelks (1962:92),
however, points out that the non-ceramic material culture of the
Chupek Site is more akin to that of the Late Prehistoric of Central
Texas than that of East Texas. The latter is an undeniably val id
point, but must be tempered with the observation that the quality and
distribution of I ithic resources is divergent between the two areas as
are, to some degree, the exploitable resources. One might expect
variations in I ithic technology due to both of these factors, even if
the groups inhabiting the Chupik Site were from East Texas.
The extent of artifactual differences suggest, however, that
different
groups
inhabited the two areas, as opposed to the
possibi I ity that the Chupik Site, and especially the sites with fewer
ceramics, might have been occupied by groups of wandering hunters
moving westward from major East Texas Caddo sites. The exact nature
of the relationship between the two culture areas remains unknown.
Are there I inguistic, political or religious similarities, face to
face contact, or long distance exchange through intermediary groups?
In Chapter 45, Watson suggests three possible explanations for
the presence of Caddoan designs on Brazos River Valley pottery. These
are trade, losses by transient Caddo groups and local manufacture. He
further subdivides the latter alternative, suggesting that these
vessels may have been made locally by either native Central Brazos
groups, resident Caddoan groups or Caddoan women living with native
Central Brazos groups. He discounts the first of these latter three
alternatives, suggesting that "the wholesale adoption of an alien
technology and sty I istic tradition. . . seems uni ikely" (Watson, this
48-12

FINAL SUMMARY
volume, 45-13). In addition , he finds the second uni ikely due to the
apparent absence of typical Caddoan agricultural vi I I ages in the
region. Arguing against both trade (based on differences in color and
paste characteristics) and losses by transient groups (because of the
frequency of decorated wares present), he supports the hypothesis of a
resident group of Caddoan potters among the native Central Texas
peoples, i.e., an exchange of women between the two groups.
While losses by transient groups might explain the single vessel
at the Kyle Site or the two vessels at the McDonald Site, such an
explanation does not seem to hold up wel I at sites like Asa Warner and
Chupik with large quantities of ceramics. Thus, while there seems
every likelihood that Caddoan groups may have visited the region, and
may certainly have lost some vessels there, such visits probably do
not account for every vessel recovered from the area.
Although such potential losses cannot be estimated, some of the
other alternatives may be more plausible. One hypothesis that offers
attractive possibl I ities is the presence of a ful I time resident
group.
Sites such as Chupik and Asa Warner may represent at least
short term attempts to establish Caddoan groups within the region.
Dee Ann Story (personal communication, 1983) has suggested, however,
that such vi I I ages would be atypical without the evidence of a
religious and ceremonial center, which is so much a part of Caddoan
society to the east.
Perhaps the most attractive possibi I ity of al I is the one which
Watson favors, the exchange of women potters. He points to the work
of Troike (1957), who examined the similarities between Tonkawa and
Caddo kin terms in two dissimilar languages and kin systems. This

FINAL SUMMARY
3) NATIVE GROUP LOCAL MANUFACTURE:
Local raw materials,
Caddoan designs and fabric may be imitated, but variations would
be expected and perhaps some innovation. Other aspects of local
technology may remain who I ly unchanged.
4) RESIDENT CADDOAN GROUP MANUFACTURE: Local raw materials,
designs and fabric technology would generally be equivalent to
the East Texas standards. Possibly some other artifactual or
vi I I age spatial similarities to the East Texas Caddo groups.
Non-ceramic technology should closely resemble typical Caddo.
5) CADDOAN WOMEN MANUFACTURE:
As
above,
local
raw
materials, designs and fabric technology generally equivalent to
the East Texas standards. Non-ceramic material culture related
to women's spheres of activity may be altered, while much male
oriented technology might remain the same.
Some I inguistic
change might be expected.
Note that none of these hypotheses are mutua I I y exc I us i ve or
exhaustive.
Trade pieces, for example, may be present in addition to
locally made ceramics. Both resident Caddo and native Central Brazos
groups may be present and making ceramics. Caddoan women may have
been exchanged with native Central Brazos groups without the adoption
of pottery by these groups.
A total of 136 ceramic sherds was recovered from the various
archeological projects at Aqui I la Lake. Most are undecorated or from
the undecorated lower portions of vessels. Al I but nine are from the
McDonald Site (41HI105), where most of the sherds are from two
distinct vessels.
At that site, only five decorated

Decorated types include Canton Incised, Kiam Incised, Maydel le
Incised and Bullard Brushed (see Skinner and Henderson 1972). Several
incised and engraved specimens cannot be typed.
Since none of the
identified types is present as more than a single vessel, it is
difficult to discuss

extra-regional
re1ationships, except in very general terms.
Canton Incised and
perhaps al I the other types appear to occur throughout the Central
Brazos region (Watt 1953).
Canton Incised is regarded as a Sanders focus type commonly found
northeast Texas.
Suhm and Jelks (1962:23) describe its
in
distribution as: From southern Choctaw County, Oklahoma, southward to
the vicinity of Grand Saline on the upper Sabine River in Van Zandt
County, Texas, eastward to Titus County. Trade sherds as far west as
48-14

FINAL SUMMARY
the Dal las area and Lake Whitney on the middle Brazos River. Canton
Incised is also present at other sites in the Central Brazos (Watt
1953) as wel I as at sites in the Richland-Chambers Creek area in
Navarro County (Irvine 1983).
Kiam Incised, described by Suhm and Jelks (1962:89) as occurring
throughout the central part of eastern Texas and sporadically to the
northeast, is not mentioned in other Central Texas references, but is
somewhat difficult to identify since only the neck sherds would have
the requisite combination of horizontal inc1s1on and punctation.
Maydel le Incised, with designs similar to those of Canton Incised but
supposedly occurring much later (Suhm and Jelks 1962:103), occurs
widely throughout northeastern Texas and examples are found westward
into North and Central Texas. Bui lard Brushed is found primarily in
the Neches and Upper Sabine drainages, extending westward into Central
and North Central Texas as a trade ware (Suhm and Jelks 1962:21). Al I
of these descriptions consider the infrequent occurrences of these
types in the Central Texas area as examples of trade.
Some degree of culture contact between the Central Brazos and the
East Texas Caddo culture is evidenced by the presence of Caddo ceramic
designs in the Central Brazos area.
Although these vessels have
generally been accepted as trade items, there is I ittle hard evidence
establishing this fact. Locke's (1975) preliminary X-ray diffraction
study supports such a conclusion, but Di I lehay (1972), in a study of
firing colors and charactersitics, has suggested that the Chupik
ceramics might have been made from Aqui I la Creek clays and Watson
(1982) has suggested that the dark colors of the Aqui I la ceramics are
more suggestive of the Brazos River clays than the generally reddish
East Texas clays.
In his unpublished study, Locke (1975) explored the use of X-ray
diffraction to establish the provenience of sherds from the Chupik
Site. Analyzing a I imited sample of sherd specimens from both the
George C. Davis Site (41CE19) in Cherokee County and the Chupik Site
as wel I as several samples of local clays from the area of the Chupik
Site, Locke suggested that the Chupik sherds were more like those from
the Davis Site than the local clays.
Because of widespread mineralogical similarities among clays and
the
complex
transformation
of most clay minerals at extreme
temperatures (Shepard 1976:19-20), the X-ray diffraction technique is
I imited in the determination of clay source areas.
A chemical
analysis, utilizing techniques such as X-ray fluorescence, atomic
absorption and neutron activation analysis, would be a more suitable
means of establishing provenience.
In her discussion
of
the
distribution of Holly Fine Engraved, Ekland-Olson (1981) suggested the
use of neutron activation analysis to determine the nature of the
48-15

FINAL SUMMARY
diffusion of this type, distinguishing between trade items and locally
manufactured pieces.
The difficulty in any such analysis is the great variabi I ity tn
source clays avai Iable from a given area and the natural variation 1n
trace element composition across a particular clay bed, compounded by
the possibi I ity of alteration through preparations, i.e., mixing clays
or the addition of temper.
In a pre I iminary neutron activiation
analysis of ceramics and clay samples from Sabine Parish, Louisiana,
which included additional X-ray f luoresence studies of local clay
samples, Brown (1981) found variation even among sherds from the same
vessel and relatively low correlations between sherds and source
samples near the site. Although this study delimited some interesting
ceramic groupings, it strongly suggested that an effective study must
include a large sample of both ceramic sherds and source material
samples. Additionally, the chemical analysis of ceramic samples
should be preceded by or conducted 1n conjunction with mineralogical
analyses such as X-ray diffraction or petrographic (thin section)
analysis.
While chemical analyses are often expensive and may require
extensive sample preparation, mineralogical analyses can usually be
accomplished more rapidly with less overal I effort. And, as suggested
above, it is important for mineralogical analyses to precede, if
possible, and be uti Ii zed in the design of chemical analyses.
A
preliminary thin section analysis of sherds from the Aqui I la Lake area
has been conducted in conjunction with this project by
David
G. Robinson of the Texas Archeological Survey. Final results of this
study wi II be presented in a later pub I ication, but the preliminary
results are avai Iable for this report.
The preliminary analysis, which included observation of thin
sections of ceramic sherds under both ordinary and polarizing I ight,
as well as megascopic and binocular microscopic examination, was
designed to detect technological and mineral inclusion similarities
between several widely spaced sites. Although quantification is an
ultimate goal of the study, the data reported here are qualitative,
based on simple inspection of the sherds and the recognition of the
presence, absence or gross differences in certain obvious traits.
Six Aqui Ila Lake sherds were selected from the study, consisting
of three specimens from the McDonald Site, two from 41Hllll and a
single specimen from 41HI154. Another Hi I I County sherd, from the
Hickory Fine Engraved vessel at the Kyle Site, was included in the
present study. Sherds from two major ceramic sites in Mclennan County
to the south of the project area were included: one from the Chupik
Site and another two from the Asa Warner Site.
Comparative samples
from the Caddo country to the east included three specimens from the
48-16

FINAL SUMMARY
George C. Davis Site in Cherokee County, one sherd from 41BW6 in Bowie
County, one sherd from the Crenshaw Mound in Mi Iler County, Arkansas
and two sherds from the Hanna Site in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana.
Farther afield to the west the sample included two sherds from 41CN64
in Coleman County, two sherds from 41CK100 in Coke County and one
sherd each from 41FL11 and 41FL12 in Floyd County. In al I, 23 sherds
were examined in the preliminary phase of the project.
A brief report of the first results of this study was submitted
by Robinson, and the fol lowing section quotes from a part of that
report (Robinson ms.), describing the clusters identified and the
regional affinities between them.
Generally, the Hi I I County Aqui I la Reservoir Project
sherds and al I the comparative sherds belong to the ceramic
family of low-fired earthenwares.
The Hi I I and Mclennan
counties sherds are thick, and copious amounts of deliberate
tempering particles and natural sol id inclusions interrupt
ceramic fabrics broken also by numerous voids and cracks.
Sherd colors and tones bespeak firing atmospheres varying
from slightly oxidizing to reducing, probably due to lack of
firing control.
A. Material/Technical Mode
Clusters
On the material/technical basis of this study, the Hi I I
and Mclennan counties sample seems divisible into four
groupings, or clusters.
The clusters defined below are
described by the modes that distinguish them, or hold them
apart, not simply by al I the material and technical modes
that comprise them.
Cluster 1. Four sherds from 41Hl105, 41HI111, and
41ML46.
They are characterized by sherd tempering and a
porous, striated ceramic facbric.
Cluster 2. Three sherds from 41HI105, 41HI154, and
41ML46.
They are distinguished by hematite and ironstone
particles in fabrics otherwise similar to Cluster 1.
Cluster 3. Two sherds from 41HI1 and 41ML44.
They
have sherd tempering, but also some bone or I imestone
tempering and a denser ceramic fabric interrupted by fewer
and smaller voids.
Cluster 4. One sherd from 41Hllll.
The sherd has
sherd tempering and hematite particles similar to Cluster 2,

but shell fragments distinguish it from that cluster.

B.

Regional Modal

Affinities
Regarding the detection of modal affinities among the
sampled sites and regions, similarities were strongest, as
expected, between the Hi I I County and East Texas Caddo
region.
This basic affinity, founded in sherd tempering,
hematite and ironstone particles, and striated fabric,
extends to the Hanna Site sherds in Louisiana. Affinities
between Hi I I County and the west show in some sherds but
lack the strength of the eastward connection.
Close observation shows that Hi I I and Mclennan county
clusters 1, 2, and 4 display strong simi larities 1 with minor
distinctions as described above.
These clusters, led by
Cluster 2 1 compare closely to Cluster 1 from the George
C. Davis Site. This latter cluster, in turn, manifests
strong similarities to the Hanna Site sherds. The resulting
long east-west affinity is the strongest pattern observed in
the Rrel iminary analysis.
A secondary Caddoan affinity exists between George
C. Davis Cluster 2 and the Crenshaw Mound sherd. This
affinity is based on observed opaque particles included in
the sherd-tempered ceramic fabrics.
Sherd temper also relates Aqui I la Cluster 1 to Aquil la
Cluster 3, but Cluster 3 shows similarities westward to the
Coleman County sherds. Cluster 3 includes a sherd from
41ML44 and a sherd from the Hickory Fine Engraved vessel
unearthed at the Kyle Site, 41Hll.
Similarities with
Coleman County derive from the sharing of smooth texture,
fine voids and I imestone or bone particle modes.

48-18

FINAL SUMMARY
Continuing westward, the Coleman County sherds show
similarities with the Coke County sherds by virtue of smooth
texture, fine voids and I imestone or bone particles.
This
connection, although weaker, extends to the Floyd County
sherds on the basis of bone particles, which here are
probably the deliberate tempering agent of the ceramic.
One sample sherd, the one from Bowie County, belongs to
the
general
East
Texas
ceramic
tradition, but 1s
distinguished by the presence of mica particles.
The mica
inclusion causes the sherd to stand alone in the sample and
leaves it without any specific connections;
the sherd
claims only those broad connections based on its general
East Texas sherd temper and
striated
fabric
modes.
(Robinson ms.).
The clustering of sherds 1n this study does not
provide
conclusive evidence of the locus of manufacture of these specimens but
there are some interesting hints. Any degree of certainty must await
the study of a large sample of source material clays from these areas.
Even then, such a study might remain inconclusive.
Perhaps the most interesting cluster among the specimens is found
in the strong link between Cluster 2 from the Central Brazos area
(with a sherd each from 41HI105, 41HI154 and 41ML46) and the two sherd
cluster from the George C. Davis Site. The technological proximity of
these groups and the similarities between the mineral inclusions do
not offer conclusive proof of trade between the Central Brazos and
East Texas but do add further support to the inconclusive but
suggestive results provided by Locke (1975). It is possible that the
Hi I I County sherds in this cluster were actually manufactured at the
Davis Site and transported westward.
This observation does not offer conclusive proof of East Texas
trade vessels in the Caddo area, but at least some of the Hi I I County
vessels may have been manufactured
from
non-local
materials.
Conversely, the preliminary inspection of the Hi I I County sherds
suggests that some of the vessels may have been manufactured locally
as wel I.
In the present study, the best evidence for a trade vessel
may be represented by a sherd from the Asa Warner Site grouped with
Cluster 2, the cluster most similar to sherds from the Davis Site.
The other specimens 1n this cluster, from apparent hunting and
gathering campsites where few vessels are present, may represent
losses by transient groups.
Whether the groups might be Caddo hunting parties from East Texas
or hunting parties from a large local site, such as the Chupik Site,
carrying vessels traded to them, is sti I I a val id question, however.
48-19

FINAL SUMMARY
As previously mentioned, the Caddoan artifactual influence seems to be
I imited primarily to ceramics. Lithic technology and materials are
apparently of local or1g1n. A re-examination by this author of the
projectile points found in association with Caddoan ceramics at
Central Brazos sites (in collections at TARL) indicates influences in
the style of manufacture, but strong differences as wel I.
For
instance, although a number of Alba-I ike points, as those identified
at the McDonald Site in this repor:r;--are present at these sites, they
are generally divergent from the Alba type of East Texas. Good
examples of east Texas Alba styles are somewhat rare.
On the other
hand, contracting ste'fil""""types such as Perdiz and Perdiz-1 ike points,
comprising only a smal I percentage of the arrow points at sites such
as Davis, are the most common types at Chupik and Asa Warner.
In general, the evidence seems to suggest that the ceramic sites
recorded to date in the Central Brazos Valley are not the result of
either ful I time resident groups of Caddo or transient East Texas
Caddo hunting groups passing through the area.
This leaves the
possibility of trade, which is strongly suggested above, and local
manufacture by native Central Brazos groups, either with or without
the exchange of Caddoan women.
The study by Troike (1957) of the I inguistic similarities between
the Caddo and Tonkawa groups provides some interesting evidence in
support of the exchange of women between the East Texas ceramic
cultures and a potential Central Texas culture.
Because of the
importance of this particular evidence, it wi I I be re-examined in
I ight of the archeological and ethnohistoric data that has surfaced in
the 25 years since his study was completed.
Troike's study demonstrates strong correlations between some of
the morphemes forming kin terms in two languages related distantly, if
at al I. As he (1957:68) points out, a comparison of the general
lexicon
yields only about five percent correspondences whereas
comparison of the kinship terms shows similarities in nearly half of
the terms.
Troike proceeds to demonstrate that the shared morphemes
are derived from the proto-Caddoan and suggests that the similarities
result from acculturation on the part of the Tonkawa. Due to phonetic
alterations of the original Caddo terms, he further suggests that this
acculturation dates to the Prehistoric Period.
The Tonkawa language, collected primarily by Gatschet (1884) from
Fort Griffen, Texas and by Hoijer (1949) from Oklahoma (additional
vocabulary was recorded by Berlandier and Chowel I during the 1820s
Goddard 1979), is better documented than most of the other aboriginal
languages of the Texas area, despite the fact that it is by now
probably extinct. A number of recent studies (Hymes 1967; Haas 1967;
Troike 1967) have attempted to place the Tonkawa within some larger
48-20

FINAL SUMMARY
family but have generally concluded that it has no close genetic
relatives. Caddo, the most divergent language of the Caddoan family
(Lesser and Weltfish 1932), has been collected 1n bits and pieces by a
number of people (see Taylor 1963), but is the least wel I studied 1n
print of al I the maJor languages of the Caddoan family.
As with the state of Tonkawa I inguistic studies, some questions
have yet to be resolved about Tonkawa culture. Sjoberg's (1953)
classic study remains the substantive work on this group, although
some excel lent data has been published more recently by Jones (1969).
Much of the basic ethnographhic data reported in these sources was
collected during the middle and latter part of the nineteenth century,
long after the first contact with the white man and after possibly
radical culture changes (see Sjoberg 1953:300).
One of the more important questions concerning the Tonkawa
centers upon their historic identity.
Sjoberg and others have
accepted the Tonkawa as a composite tribe including a number of
previously
separate smal I groups such as the Mayeye, Yojuane,
Ervipiame, the Tonkawa, and a number of smaller, less wel I known
groups, such as the Emet Cavas, Sana, Toho and Tohaha (Sjoberg
1953:281). Much of the evidence for the relationship of these groups
1s Bolton's (1908) analysis of mission records where the four main
T.N. Campbel l's reanalysis of
the
groups were found together.
evidence suggests that it is not very strong; only one young Tonkawa
girl was actually residing with these other groups (Campbel I, personal
communication, 1982). Evidence for the association of other groups is
primarily negative; they cannot be associated with other known groups
in the area (see Sjoberg 1953:281).
The only hard evidence for I inguistic aff i I iation between any of
these groups is the statement by an old Tonkawa that the Mayeye, who
I ived near the coast, spoke a dialect of Tonkawa (Gatschet 1891:37).
Contrasted to the lack of early evidence of relationships between
these groups, it seems clear that many of them were found in
association during the Historic Period after decimation of their
original populations. Further evidence for historic relationships
between these groups is suggested by several of the Tonkawa "clan"
names that para I lel some of the earlier bands: Meyei, Sanux and Kwesh
for Mayeye, Sana and Cavas (Sjoberg 1953;
Troike 1957). These
historic associations provide nothing but slim circumstantial evidence
for any prehistoric similarities in language and culture. When
studying the culture and language of the nineteenth and twentieth
century Tonkawa, a group certainly much altered from the original
protohistoric Tonkawa proper, numerous doubts can arise about the
reliabi I ity of extending any data backward in time too far.

48-21

FINAL SUMMARY
Further problems have arisen in the attempt to document the
prehistoric homelands of these Tonkawa groups. Popularly, the Tonkawa
are though of as having inhabited the Central Texas area, perhaps
centered around Austin. While most of the references to the Tonkawa
and associated groups do indeed fal I into the Central and South
central Texas area (coincidentally the area settled by the Spaniards
and earliest Texans), the earliest references to two of the main
groups do not.
Thus, 1n 1698, the Ervipiame were at a mission in
northwestern Mexico and, 1n 1719, the Tonkawa, and probably the
Yojuane, were seen along the middle reaches of the Red River (Sjoberg
1953:282). More recent evidence comes from Newcomb and Campbel I
(1982) who suggest that the Tancoa people recorded as being somewhere
in northern Oklahoma during the Date expedition of 1601, might be the
earliest reference to the historic Tonkawa proper.
The ethnohistoric data on the early Tonkawa appear to make
Troike's analysis more complex.
Were the later historic Tonkawa a
composite of bands, with conceivably different cultures and perhaps
even different languages, from as far apart as northeastern Mexico and
northwestern Oklahoma, (around 800 miles)? Even if these groups spoke
similar dialects, the potential for minor regional variations and
locally diffused loan words seems enormous. More importantly, which
group had absorbed certain Caddo kin terms and why did their
terminology take hold?
One I inguistic problem is solved by the re-analysis, however.
Troike, who believed the prehistoric Tonkawa to be located in Central
Texas, is often forced to rely on speculation concerning their
supposed
Caddo
neighbors, the Hasinai, whose dialect and kin
terminology have not been recorded.
Apparently, the closest Caddo
neighbors
of
an
Oklahoma-based
Tonkawa would have been the
Kaddohadacho, whose kin terms Troike does use in his analysis.
Unfortunately, while a Central Texas Tonkawan group might have been
close neighbors to the Hasinai, the northwestern Oklahoma Tonkawa
would have been separated from the southeastern Oklahoma Kaddohadacho
by a number of apparent Wichita groups (Newcomb and Campbel I 1982).
In any case, there is definite evidence for prehistoric Caddo
influence 1n the Central Brazos study area in the distribution of
typical Caddoan sty I istic motifs found on ceramics at such sites as
the Kyle Site, the Chupik Site, the Asa Warner Site, the McDonald Site
and many others.
Watson's
conclusion
that
the
process
of
acculturation by the Tonkawa might have occurred through the exchange
of women is supported by early historic observations that women were
traded widely among the aboriginal peoples of Texas (De Solis 1931).

48-22

FINAL SUMMARY
The exchange of women between the two groups would provide a
means by which the hypothesized acculturation could occur. The
I inguistic similarities in kin terms apparently reflect more than just
lexical
alteration;
they
indicate
basic
changes in social
organization as expressed in kinship. Such changes do not come about
so easily.
Changes in kin reckoning are a reasonable result of the
admission into the society of a number of women whose conceptual
framework of kin relationships is different. One might expect that
the children of such women would be raised with at least a mixed view
of kin relationships, if not a dual terminology.
The diffusion of pottery technology is some evidence for the
exchange of women as a means of acculturation, assuming that women
were potters in prehistoric Caddo society as they were in historic
times. Further confirmation of the hypothesis wi I I probably depend on
linguistic and ethnohistoric sources rather than archeological ones.
One potentially important source is an analysis of shared kin terms.
If the transmission of kin terms is through the Caddo mother, it is
likely that the terms least I ikely to show any alteration are those
that would describe her relatives and those reflecting a male ego.
Correlates should therefore exist primarily among patri I ineal and
generational I ines rather than matri I ineal ones.
This is true of the three stem forms Troike indicates as
identical:
father's sister (â¢haw), chi Id (*han) and cross-cousin
(â¢sak). Another good correspondence is found in the woman's term for
sister.
Relationships between the parental and grandparental terms
are less sure; the terms for mother (Caddo â¢sahs and Tonkawa *Sa?)
are the best pair of correlates, again offering support for the
exchange hypothesis. Troike finds only one correlate among the set of
mother's relatives, the term for mother's brother. It is perhaps
noteworthy that this latter relationship is derived on the basis of
Troike's assumption that the Hasinai Caddo would have been the source
influence (and this only on the basis
of
an
undemonstrated
relationship
between
the
neighboring Yatasi language and the
unrecorded Hasinai). Another correlate between the terms for sister's
chi Id (man speaking) is not particularly strong.
The eight terms which Troike identifies as good correlates and
comparable terms from other Texas Indian Languages are I isted below in
Table 48.1. Obviously, five of the relationships expressed (M, F,
FSs, D, Ss[ws]) support the exchange hypothesis offered above, while
three do not. The three which do not, however, are the least strong
correlates. The least believable is the relationship between the male
terms for sister's children (Tonkawa saxwana and Caddo pa:tsi).
Not
only are these phonologically divergent, but semantically different as
wel I. Saxwana is also an alternate term for mother's brother, while
pa:tsi 1s apparently not, and as such is probably a closer correlate

Along these same I ines, the other Tonkawa term for mother's
brother, ta:?wa?, is not particularly close to the Caddo terms, ibah
and banin. In fact, the *?wa? stem (the *ta: prefix also occurs in
the Tonkawa term for father) is not that different from phonetic
segments contained in other Caddo languages such as the Pawnee
mother>s brother, tiwatsiriks (Rood 1976), or supposedly unrelated
languages such as Coahui ltecan (nakwanax; Ruecking 1955) or Atakapa
Gatschet and Swanton 1932). Here, also, there are semantic
(waxc:
differences as wel I; ta:?wa? is also the Tonkawa woman>s term for
her father's sister's son.
The other term which does not fit the predicted pattern, that for
grandmother, is somewhat unc I ear. The Tonkawa term given is actua I I y
that for mother's mother (father's mother is kasa?), while the Caddoan
stock terms are more general (Caddo and Pawnee terms mean grandmother;
Wichita is for grandparent). As is obvious from Table 48.1, there are
phonological similarities between a number of different languages for
this term, the Tonkawa term being closer to the Wichita that the
Caddo.
In any case, this resemblance 1s not particularly good
evidence for a Caddo-Tonkawa relationship.

48-24

FINAL SUMMARY
Although it seems that the five terms potentially uti Ii zed by
women are the best correlates, it must be pointed out that the
reduction of the I ist stretches an already tenuous hypothesis.
Troike's figure of 53.3% agreement between the two kin system
terminologies is somewhat misleading. This figure is only for the
fifteen kin categories which Caddo and Tonkawa recognize (or are
recorded as recognizing) in common. Both languages contain a number
of unrelated terms for relatives whose overlap in the two different
kin systems is complex.
morphological
Also obvious is the fact that many of the
relationships are pan-Caddoan and may have come originally from any
one of a number of unrecorded Wichita or Caddo dialects.
An
interesting footnote to this is the suggestion by Newcomb and Campbel I
(1982) that the Aguacane (Wichita) subgroup known as the Yuhuanica to
Date in 1601 may have been the Yojuane, later recorded as a Tonkawa
subgroup. One of the first recorded historic appearances of both the
Tonkawa and Yojuane is on the middle reaches of the Red River in 1719
(Sjoberg 1953:282).
Although the I inguistic evidence is certainly suggestive of some
relationship between the aboriginal or early historic Caddo and
Tonkawa, it does not provide a clear picture of the process through
which acculturation took place. The exchange of women, documented for
some groups by ethnohistoric evidence, is not clearly supported by the
I inguistic evidence.
The possibi I ities for further I inguistic study
have not been exhausted, however. Reconstruction of the proto-Caddoan
kin terminology may be useful. A particularly good test would be an
analysis of the existing lexical correlates between Tonkawa and Caddo
to see if the correlate terms suggest any association with women's
activities. A more intensive re-examination of the extant I inguistic
data is suggested.
Even if one granted the I inguistic kin correlates as good
evidence for exchange of women, there sti I I remains the problem of the
actual location of the Tonkawa. If Newcomb and Campbel I (1982) are
correct in their identification of the Tancoa as the people later
known as Tonkawa, then it is difficult to place the Tonkawa 1n the
Central Brazos during the Prehistoric Period. There is no clear early
ethnohistoric evidence for any particular group in this area, but
Campbel I (personal communication, 1984) has suggested the possibility
of looking at the Kanohatino mentioned in Swanton (1942).
In any case, the exchange of women hypothesis is supported by the
ethnohistoric evidence (De Sol is 1931). Preliminary ceramic fabric
analyses suggest that both trade and locally made vessels may have
co-existed in the Central Brazos region. In summing up this section,
it seems more than possible that many or al I of the various options

48-25

FINAL SUMMARY
I isted above may describe the prehistoric situation, but that no
single solution is acceptable by itself. For example, it seems clear
that Caddoan hunting parties from East Texas would have been present,
and some single vessel finds may be derived from the context of their
temporary encampments.
Such encampments do not easily explain the
presence of large sites with numerous vessels or locally made wares.
Trade vessels seem to have been present, either traded in to native
Brazos River or local Caddoan groups.

A ful I sty I istic analysis of the vessels from the Central Brazos
region and a comparison to various Caddo styles is the needed next
step. A cursory examination suggests that there are some local
variations on the typical Caddo motifs, but these are generally
insignificant and probably traceable to individual potter variations.
Thus, it is tentatively hypothesized that the variation is not great
enough to indicate imitation by a local group; the imitation is too
perfect. Also contraindicated by the lack of defined variation is the
existence of a local pottery tradition for any great length of time.
During a few hundred years or more of a local pottery tradition by any
groups, native or Caddoan, some sty! istic evolution would surely have
occurred, as styles drifted farther away from the original.
Such seeming stylistic rigidity leaves two viable possibi I ities
for the manufacture of the locally made wares. Either a Caddoan group
occupied the area for a period of insufficient duration for sty I istic
drift to have occurred, or the continual infusion of Caddo women
potters into native Central Brazos groups I inked the local ceramic
tradition closely to that of the main Caddo area.

TECHNOLOGY

OF

As at many hunter and gatherer archeological sites throughout the
world, I ithics are virtually the only artifactual material preserved.
With the exception of a tiny collection of ceramics from a handful of
sites, and three sites with a sample of faunal materials present, the
sites in the Aqui I la Lake project area are exclusively I ithic sites.
It becomes important then, to undertake the study of both areal and
temporal patterns in the manufacture and utilization of I ithic
artifacts.
The primary concern of such a study should be the elicitation of
particular cultural adaptations represented by the I ithic artifacts
and potential changes in those adaptations.
Local adaptations can
then be placed in a broader regional framework and compared to
neighboring areas. Changing adaptations can be examined in the light
of possible alterations in environmental settings. It is not clear
how good an indicator I ithic technology might be of such phenomena,

48-26

FINAL SUMMARY
but since a reasonable portion of I ithic technology is directly
involved in the procurement and preparation of the subsistence base
(and also indirectly in the manufacture of wood, bone, hide and fiber
subsistence tools), it is not unreasonable to expect the examination
of
I ithic debris to yield valuable information on prehistoric
adaptations.
The most direct avai I able evidence for the understanding of
prehistoric adaptations is the morphology and function of stone tools,
both formal and informal.
Formal tools, particularly projectile
points, have traditionally provided the archeologist with the most
important data for the reconstruction of past lifeways.
Projectile
points, representing relatively large expenditures of energy among
Central Texas hunter
gatherers
(i.e.,
more
energy
expended
individually
1n
their manufacture than 1n informal tools and
occasionally more total energy expended in the
production
of
projectile points than for other, usually less common, finely finished
bifacial tools), have always been of the utmost importance in
understanding areal and temporal variation in cultural patterns. In
recent years, they have come to be important in the study of tool
function as wel I, with the resulting evidence suggesting that many
specimens may have served other purposes besides the tip of a
projectile weapon (Ahler 1971). This has led to some interesting new
speculations on the relationship between morphology and function in
various types (Kelly 1983) and may ultimately yield new data on
prehistoric adaptations.
Projectile point typology has been an important emphasis of this
report for several reasons. In the first place, I ithic debris 1s a
major component of the Aqui I la Lake sites and projectile points have
demonstrated
a proven abi I ity to provide cultural information.
Secondly, projectile points have been emphasized because of the
perceived uniqueness of the assemblage from the project area. A close
examination of the projectile points from the project area shows that
they cannot easily be glossed over as a typical Central or North
Central Texas assemblage. Chapter 44 of this report has emphasized
the apparent changes in projectile point types in the Aqui I la Lake
area from the Paleoindian Period through the Late Prehistoric.
Much
of the discussion in that chapter is based on comparative morphologies
of specimens between the Aqui I la Lake area and Central and North
Central Texas since very few radiocarbon dated projectile points were
recovered from project sites.
Conclusions from Chapter 44 suggest Paleoindian and Early Archaic
components in the Central Brazos that are very similar to those found
widely distributed throughout the central portion of Texas in those
periods.
Subsequently,
in
the Middle Archaic, Central Texas
projectile points become less common than expected, especially the

48-27

FINAL SUMMARY
otherwise ubiquitous Pedernales, and it was concluded that cultural
adaptations within the project area became more isolated from Central
Texas proper and perhaps more closely related to adaptations in the
north and east. During the Late Archaic, an apparent population
increase was coupled with a localized Central Brazos projectile point
style (Godley) and strong influences from the north and east in the
form of contracting stem projectile points such as Gary. Again during
the Late Prehistoric, widespread cultural adaptations are reflected in
similarities in projectile point morphology. Most interesting are the
apparent ties to East Texas in ceramic design motifs during the latter
portion of the Late Prehistoric.
Despite artifact similarities,
I ittle evidence has been recovered that would suggest the permanence
and elaboration of settlements, as in East Texas. Overal I there may
have been little change in either societal complexity or subsistence
technology throughout the Late Prehistoric.
As in other parts of Central Texas, there are minor technological
differences associated with the production of differing Archaic
projectile point styles.
These cannot, however, be convincingly
associated
with
either
evolutionary
changes in manufacturing
technology or particular changes in cultural adaptations. Only one as
yet unproven technological change bears mentioning here. The wide
thinned bases and occasionally slightly thick distal ends of some
Paleoindian and Early Archaic projectile points suggest that they were
made with the proximal end of a flake blank as the distal end of the
projectile.
During the Late Archaic in the Aqui I la Lake area, this
trend was reversed with the arrival of contracting stemmed projectile
points from the north and east, as indicated by cortex and single
facet platforms sti I I remaining on the stems of many specimens.
This
reflects a technological trend that may have come into vogue much
earlier to the north and east. Sti I I unknown is the technological
approach to Middle as wel I as some Early and Late Archaic specimens.
Whether or not they may have been reduced from core bifaces IS not
known at this time.
Because of the paucity of defined formal tool types other than
projectile points associated with particular cultures or periods, and
because of the scarcity of these non-projectile formal tools in the
project area, I ittle can be said of changing technologies in the
manufacture and use of these tools. Only a few specimens fit within
established
formal tool types.
These include possible Archaic
specimens such as Erath bifaces (Story and Shafer 1965), and probable
Late Prehistoric types such as Cleburne, Covington and Friday knives
(Jelks 1962).
Traditionally, much archeological interest has been centered upon
sty I istic and potential functional changes in I ithic artifacts,
especially projectile points and other stone tools.
Unfortunately,
48-28

FINAL SUMMARY
without a sufficient sample of materials, few other aspects of
prehistoric stoneworking are realistically open to the analyst. Smal I
samples of debitage, unless they contain unusual or remarkable pieces
such as bipolar flakes or prismatic blades, can provide only I imited
information on prehistoric cultures.
In most cases, such samples
rarely represent an appreciable sample of a single flintworking
episode and are thus a skewed sample of an idiosyncratic event.
The miniscule I ithic samples from the Archaic levels of the deep
1982 excavation unit in Area B at the McDonald Site are a case in
point. The relatively extensive excavations in the Late Prehistoric
occupation levels yielded an adequate sample from that cultural zone,
but the density of debris and excavated area drops off rapidly below
the Late Prehistoric strata. The lack of an adequate sample size in
the Archaic layers underscores the paucity of single component
archeological materials in the Aqui I la collections. The recovery of
stratigraphical ly isolated cultural materials is critical for a proper
analysis of changes in lithic technology. The McDonald Site, where
sample sizes in the lower strata were generally insufficient for
analysis, was the single case where buried multiple occupation layers
al lowed an attempt at stratigraphic analysis.
In spite of the lack of a wel I defined, appropriate data base,
some attempt has been made to confront problems in changing lithic
technology. This was done not only because the data are even more i I I
suited to other analytical approaches, but because it was felt
important to at least generate some ideas for potential further
testing in the region. Some ideas concerning the I ithic technology of
the region have been touched upon in the larger site excavation
chapters and in the summaries at the end of each major section. A
ful I discussion of the problems involved in the lithic analysis and
some more general overal I conclusions regarding I ithic technology are
contained in Chapter 42.
Lynott and Peter (1977) first proposed changes in the lithic
technology of the Aqui I la Lake area. Skinner et al. (1978), while
alluding to the probabi I ity of changing I ithic technology through
time, concentrated their efforts on understanding I ithic technology as
a potential indicator of varying site function. Four site types were
hypothesized:
base camps, hunting/gathering camps, mussel foraging
stations and quarry/workshop sites.
Each was characterized by a
distinctive set of I ithic technological variables.
Base camps are expected to have a high overal I I ithic density, to
have flake assemblages with a ful I range of dorsal surface cortex
percentages, but with interior flakes most common, and to exhibit high
percentages of debitage relative to specialized function sites. In
addition, multifaceted platforms should predominate, cores should show
48-29

FINAL SUMMARY
greater degrees of reduction (i.e., with core fragments, exhausted
cores and multidimensional specimens most prevalent), and non-local
I ithic materials should be present in larger quantities.
At the hunting/gathering camp, it was expected that I ithic
density should be low, flake assemblages should be dominated by
smal !er interior flakes and that tools rather than debitage would be
emphasized in the assemblage.
Cortex and single facet platforms
should be most common and non-local I ithic materials infrequent.
Mussel foraging stations are hypothesized to have a similar I ithic
technology with low I ithic densities and lower percentages
of
debitage.
Quarry/workshops sites should have high densities of I ithic
debris and high percentages of debitage with evidence of the early
stages of I ithic reduction, as we! I as very low tool to debitage
ratios.
Non-local stone materials should be rare, cortex platforms
should predominate, flakes wi I I be larger and cores and large bi faces
abundant.
In order to evaluate these test expectations, several sites
investigated during the 1975 and 1977 seasons were categorized
according to the quadripartite site function classification scheme and
their environmental and artifact assemblage parameters examined. The
results of these examinations were ambiguous at best;
some of the
expectations
were met while many others were not (Skinner et
al. 1978:95-120).
With respect to the mixed nature of Aqui I la Lake sites, it is not
clear whether or not there is one truly unmixed single component site
preserved within the project area.
Certainly, none of the sites
investigated during the 1975 and 1977 seasons were exemplary in this
respect. The strongest evidence for such a site is at the McKenzie
Site (41HI115) where a single stratum of mussel she! I and a handful of
I ithics suggest a single bri~f occupation. Even here there is some
suggestion that the mussel she! I may have resulted from several
episodes of gathering and processing. Nonetheless, the site is almost
unquestionably a single function site (at least in terms of preserved
material culture). Unfortunately, the total I ithic sample recovered
1s wel I below any standards of statistical uti I ity.
Next to the McKenzie Site, the McDonald Site is the most
prom1s1ng example of a site with separable components, being deeply
buried in alluvial sediments with at least a few stratigraphic markers
present.
Yet, as previously noted, adequate samples of the cultural
remains at this site exist only from the Late Prehistoric occupation
levels,
where
it is difficult to establish any stratigraphic
separation. Samples of lithic debris from the Archaic levels are too

small for any large scale analysis.
48-30

FINAL SUMMARY

Had the sites uti I ized in their analysis been unmixed examples,
it is not clear if the results would have been any more gratifying, at
least with respect to I ithic technology. In their analysis, I ittle
attention is given to potential temporal differences (sites are only
divided into Archaic and Late Prehistoric or Late Archaic/Late
Prehistoric groupings) or resource avai labi I ity. With regard to the
former, there is no clear evidence that I ithic technology did not
change somewhat during the long Archaic Period. In fact, there are
some suggestions that I ithic technology remained relatively constant
throughout the Late Archaic and early Late Prehistoric, changing in
the latter portion of the Late Prehistoric Period.
Resource avai labi I ity is perhaps even more critical.
Al I base

camps are not created equal.
resources may be marked by relativ~ly specialized artifactual remains.
Sites such as the Bailey Site (41HI77), nearest to a potentially large
area of upland Cross Timbers oak forest than other sites, may have
been continuously occupied for some time, while an emphasis on acorn
processing may have yielded a specialized tool kit.
Although no
evidence of a specialized tool kit for acorn processing exists at the
Bailey Site, the large features found there are unique in the
reservoir area and may be the closest local synonym of the burned rock
midden of Central Texas, a site type occasional iy suggested to be
related to the processing of acorns (Prewitt 1974).
Of some importance in determining
the
immediate
overal I
technological attributes of a particular archeological site is the
distance to I ithic source materials. While the distance to source
materials is often considered important in terms of the long distances
required to actually import non-local raw materials, it is viewed here
as a least cost resource: the closer the resource, the greater the
evidence of primary resource collection and initial stage workmanship.
In other words, a site located immediately upon a I ithic resource
should have greater percentages of cores and primary flakes than a
site located at some distance.
Some empirical support for this
hypothesis is presented in Chapter 42.
The lithic model discussed above is static rather than dynamic,
however.
Perhaps the most important diachronic I ithic model proposed
for the Central Brazos is that discussed by Skinner and Gallagher
(1974) from excavations at the Bowling Pin and Indian Springs sites at
Lake Whitney. They attempt to separate debitage characteristics of
Late
prehistoric and Archaic sites on the basis of differing
projectile point production sequences. In their opinion, the debitage

In

If this hypothesis were to be substantiated, we felt
that three statements would have to be verified. First,
interior, and possibly secondary, flakes would constitute a
larger portion of the total debitage in the Archaic Period
than in the Neo-American Period.
Our rationale was that
both biface reduction and core reduction would yield about
the same number of primary flakes if the material size was
held constant;
at the same time because the interior
flakes, and possibly secondary, flakes were being made to
produce arrow points, they would occur more frequently in
Neo-American sites. Our second criterion was that despite
the
occasional
difficulties in distinguishing between
core
remnants
would
roughouts and cores, cores and
constitute a larger portion of the artifact assemblage at
Neo-American sites. Thirdly, bifaces, including roughouts,
blanks, and preforms, would make up a more significant
assemblage at Archaic sites than at Neo-American sites.
(Skinner and Gallagher 1974:77).
Comparing data from the primarily Archaic Indian Springs Site
(x41HI5) and the Late Prehistoric Bowling Pin Site (x41BQ8), the
authors admit partial support for their hypothesis. As predicted, at
the earlier x41HI5, cores only comprise 9.3%, while at x41BQ8 they
account for 25.8% of the total assemblage. Bifaces show the expected
reverse trend, with 25.0% at x41HI5 and 15.3% at x41BQ8. Debitage was
not found to be in accord with the hypothesis, however, since combined
secondary and primary flakes at x41HI5 total led more (90.3%) than at
x41BQ8 (84.2%). They conclude that debitage may not be a sensitive
indicator of technological change (Skinner and Gallagher 1974:80).
The relatively obvious differences between dart and arrow point
manufacture processes suggest intuitive support for such a hypothesis.
There are some problems inherent in such an analysis.
One maJor
difficulty in comparing artifact percentages is site function. While
the authors attempted to correct for this by selecting sites which
were thought to be functionally similar (Skinner and Gallagher
1974:53), the assessment was made on a I imited sample of material.
And despite the seemingly obvious fact that cores should be more
common on Late Prehistoric sites, differences in the immediate
avai labi I ity of I ithic raw materials could easily influence the
totals.
The conclusion that debitage may not be a good indicator of

characteristics such as the number of secondary or interior flakes
48-32

FINAL SUMMARY
might not be particularly sensitive. Despite this, their hypothesis
that primary flakes would remain the same while secondary and interior
flakes would increase 1s a mathematical impossibi I ity when dealing
with percentages.
Alternate hypotheses are avai I able for the explanation
of
debitage patterns.
While Skinner and Gallagher expect more interior
flakes from a technology geared toward flake production, it may be the
opposite:
interior flakes are less common because they are depleted
by use in arrow point production.
This latter hypothesis is in
keeping with the actual trend found at these sites. In fact, the
relatively similar relationships between primary and secondary flakes
at both sites (primary flakes comprise 22.8% of the corticate debitage
at x41BQ8 while they comprise 19.3% at x41HI5) suggest that the lower
percentage of interior flakes at x41BQ8 might be due to depletion. In
other words, when al I other factors are held constant, reduction of
raw materials yields simi Jar ratios of primary, secondary and tertiary
debitage. When one of these three categories is depleted, the ratio
between the remaining two is not altered.
Despite the obvious problems, it is worth at least a brief
comparison of the model to Aqui I la Lake area data. Two sites are an
extremely I imited sample for the verification of any model 1 no matter
how intuitive it might be.
There are problems in effecting the
comparison, however. Few single component sites are avai I able for
comparison at Aqui I la Lake.
And, even worse, there may be some
technological differences between the two areas.
The chapter on
culture history pointed out some of the differences between Lake
Whitney and Aqui I la Lake artifact assemblages. One difference may be
technologically significant:
the increased presence of dart points
manufactured on flakes (i .e. 1 contracting stem varieties such as Gary)
during
the Late Archaic at Aqui I la Lake.
Nonetheless such a
comparison may be instructive.
Two sites, Brazi I and Sul I ivan, are almost exclusively Archaic
and afford an excel lent comparison. The two Late Prehistoric areas at
the McDonald Site also offer good Late Prehistoric comparative
material.
To the latter is added the material from the Reps Davis
Site, which may be primarily Late Prehistoric although this is
unclear, and the two mixed I ithic workshop assemblages from 41HI109
Table
and 41HI110, emphasizing functional over temporal differences.
48.2 shows the differences between these various sites. Note that
artifact percentages do not include flake and chip debitage, which was
not separated at the Bowling Pin and Indian Springs sites.
Examination of the figures from this table shows some support for
the Skinner and Gal Jagher hypothesis in the average figures. Cores
are less frequent on the average at Archaic than at Late Prehistoric

FINAL SUMMARY
Despite the apparent correspondences of the average percentages,
the trend is anything but straightforward in the individual sites.
For example, while cores are noticeably more prominent at x41BQ8 and
41HI58 than at any other sites, cores at both of the Late Prehistoric
components at the McDonald Site are less frequent than at any other
site.
The Archaic component at the McDonald Site has a higher
percentage of cores than the upper levels. The core percentages are
remarkably consistent at three of the four Archaic components, and one
of the mixed I ithic workshop components, hovering at around eight or
nine percent.
Only the Brazi I Site (41HI75) is anomalous in this
respect.
The trend among biface percentages at individual sites is also
unclear.
Bifaces are more common than would be expected at both of
the Late Prehistoric McDonald Site components, while the Brazil Site
has fewer than expected.
Both of these components and the Archaic
component at the same site (which is higher, as expected under the
model) are the highest of al I single components. Note, however, that
both of the mixed component I ithic workshop sites have extremely high
biface percentages, suggesting that site function may be a more
important determinant of biface percentages than age.
The high
percentages of thick and/or unfinished bifaces at these sites have
been noted in previous sections.
The common presence of bi faces in Late Prehistoric sites is wel I
documented both at Aqui I la Lake and in other areas. Friday, Cleburne
and Covington bifaces have been found at the McDonald Site and also at
the Kyle Site - where they were orginal ly defined (see Jelks 1962).
Bifaces are also common in the Late Prehistoric levels at the Bear
Creek Site at Lake Whitney (Lynott 1978:40) where they form 24.4~ of
the stone tool assemblage (including cores and ground stone so as to
be comparable to the figures above). The Archaic levels from the same
site yielded only 17.8% non-projectile point bifaces by comparison.
In general, it appears that neither cores nor bifaces are clear
indicators of the change from bifacial reduction to core-flake
technology as is suggested by Skinner and Gallagher (1974). This may
be because of the continued use of bifaces in the Late Prehistoric and
the previous usage of cores as a source for minimally modified flake
tools.
Table 48.2 i I lustrates the predominance of informal tools in
al I assemblages. If anything, they appear to be more common in the
Archaic, a fact that may offset the increase in core-flake technology
associated with arrow point production. It is suggested here that
site function plays the dominant role in determining biface and core
percentages. If site function could be held constant, technological
change through time might become a measurable factor.

48-35

FINAL SUMMARY
A look at the final criterion of technological change, flake
percentages, is similarly inconclusive. Comparing corticate versus
decorticate flakes (because of differing definitions uti I ized for
primary and secondary flakes; fortunately interior flakes are almost
universally defined as who I ly without cortex) yields figures which
suggest that interior flakes may be slightly less common at Late
Prehistoric sites, perhaps because they are depleted for blank use.
This trend does not hold at the McDonald Site, however, where the
Archaic component in Area B has an identical corticate/decorticate
ratio to the Late Prehistoric component in that same area, while being
only slightly greater than in the Late Prehistoric component in Area
A.
At Bear Creek Shelter (Lynott 1978), the corticate debitage is
only slightly more common in the Late Prehistoric levels, with a
corticate/decorticate ratio of 0.8:1 as compared to a ratio of 0.7:1
1n the Archaic levels.
Although differences 1n the I ithic artifact assemblages are
common at Aqui I la Lake, they vary within certain generally restricted
I imits. Debitage at the major sites, for example, ranges from 90.5%
of the total assemblage at the Reps Davis Site to 97.3% at the Bailey
Site. Bifaces range from approximately equal in number or slightly
less than projectile points (at the Bailey Site) to more than three
times as many (at the Sul I ivan Site and 41HI110).
Cores are a
relatively invariable component. With one exception (Reps Davis with
3.9% cores), they range between 0.2% of the total I ithic assemblage at
the McDonald Site and 1.2% at 41HI110.
The analysis of differences such as these shows very little
evidence of changes through time in I ithic technology. In fact, the
evidence is unclear in the documentation of the known technological
shift from arrow point to dart point manufacture. Subtler changes are
beyond the range of this analysis. Only one temporal change 1n the
Aqui I la Lake artifact assemblage was postulated.
This was the
possible depletion of I ithic resources through
time,
possibly
resulting in the increasing dependence on smaller cobble blanks and
resulting higher corticate/decorticate ratios. Such a change could
however, result from the depletion of decorticate flakes as arrow
point blanks. The possible depletion of terrace gravels is addressed,
albeit inconclusively, in the collection of source materials from
41HI165 and several other locations 1n the area.
In general, the interpretation of changes 1n I ithic assemblage
characteristics relied heavily upon the distance to source materials
in the middle terraces and the higher Uvalde gravels.
With a few
inconsistencies, many of the differences in the assemblages can be
explained as a function of distance to source material, ranging from
adjacent to or congruent with the site to more than a half kilometer
distant. While these distances are within the reach of the briefest
48-36

FINAL SUMMARY
foray from the camp, they are seen as least cost barriers over time.
Although primary reduction occurs at al I sites (as indicated by the
presence of cores and primary flakes) it occurs with greater frequency
at or near the spot where the original cobble
was
secured.
Conversely, final reduction and maintenance activities occur most
commonly at habitation sites.

AQUILLA LAKE AREA.

PROPOSED

FOR

THE

Since Gordon Wi I ley (1953) first
described
the
changing
settlement patterns of the Viru Valley on the north central coast of
Peru, they have become an almost essential step
in
regional
archeological synthesis.
The 1955 Seminars in Archaeolo
synthesis
of community patterning types (Beardsley et al-.-1956
represents one
of
the
early
attempts
to
merge
ethnographic
models with
anthropological evolutionary theory in a series of stages that could
yield test expectations recognizeable in archeological data. The six
basic types of community patterns
presented
range
from
the
unrestricted movements of the Free Wandering community to the complex
state societies of the Supra-Nuclear Integrated community. During the
early Historic Period, Wichita and other agricultural groups moving
into the area, probably fit within the Semi-Permanent Sedentary type
of community, where a community is usually associated with a single
stable vi I I age that moves periodically (Beardsley et al. 1956:140).
Previous archeological research in the project area (Skinner and
Henderson 1972;
Lynott and Peter 1977; Skinner et al. 1978) has
imp I ied that prior to the Historic Period, such semi-permanent
vi I I ages
were uncharacteristic, if not absent, with settlement
patterns fal I ing in the range of the Restricted Wandering and
Central-Based Wandering communities.
The ethnographical ly unknown
(or, at least, rare) Free Wandering community is not considered.
The choice of either of these major settlement types is a matter
of some dispute between the authors of the various Aquil la Lake
reports. The goal of the 1977 season report (Skinner et al. 1978) was
to settle this dispute in a scientific manner by setting up hypotheses

and testing them against data gathered during the testing phase.
hypotheses and some of their test imp I ications relating to I ithic
technology have been discussed briefly in the preceding section of
this
chapter.
The commentary in that section pointed to the
inadequacy of the data and the simplicity of the models, suggesting
that it would be difficult to effectively prove either case.
The most tel I ing commentary on the 1977 research design and its
imp I ications was offered by Gallagher (1978) 1n a peer review of the
1977 report (Skinner et al. 1978). He points out several problems
48-37

FINAL SUMMARY
with the research design, including the assumption of unchanged
adaptations throughout the last 2,500 years of prehistory, the lack of
theoretical
I ink
to
the subsistence core concept of the
a
Central-Based Wandering community as defined
by
Beardsley
et
al. (1956)
and,
ultimately,
the
derivation of a model that
necessitates the recovery of "chronically unavai I able information" for
its verification.
The latter problem has been partially mitigated with
the
discovery of stratifed sites such as the McDonald Site, and sites with
preserved faunal materials, with potential seasonal information, such
as the former site and the McKenzie Site. Clearly, however, the
I imited extent of this sample does not afford a viable test of the
model;
many more stratified and wel I preserved sites are necessary
for any real success. The use of site size and I ithic diversity are
innovative substitutes for the primary subsistence/seasonal data, but
they are insufficient in themselves to provide convincing proof since
several alternate behavioral patterns could have resulted in the same
distribution of remains.
The importance of the assumption of stasis during the last two
and a half mi I lenia of aboriginal occupation is not clear. Certainly,
there were some relatively important technological changes, while
adaptive changes are less easy to ascertain. Shafer (1977a) has
suggested that the technological changes accompanying the transition
from Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric Austin phase did not signify a
major alteration of I ifestyle. Prewitt's (1981:82-3) discussion of
the Austin phase suggests other important changes, however. He notes
slight changes in subsistence exploitation patternsj i.e., increased
importance of hunting, the appearance of cemeteries, the increasing
use of rockshelters as habitation sites and the imp I ied appearance of
conf I ict, as reflected in the notable presence of Seal lorn points with
burials as probable cause of death rather than grave offerings.
In
the transition from the Austin to the Toyah phase, a few archeologists
might argue for substantial adaptive changes. As Prewitt (1981:83-4)
points out, while the Toyah peoples were I ike their predecessors in
many respects, marked changes in subsistence and technology occurred,
in conjunction with a possible broadening of regional convnunication
networks through population movements.
In their definition of the Central-Based Wandering community,
Beardsley et al. (1956:138-140), offerÂ· this community pattern as a
compromise, or an intermediate step, particularly in the case of
incipient agricultural communities, between nomadism and sedentary
I ife.
The dynamics that produce this half wandering and half
sedentary I ifeway include the increasing dependence on one or more of
three semi-stable food sources. In the words of the 1955 seminar,
these food sources are:
48-38

FINAL SUMMARY

.. 1) a storable or preservable wi Id food harvest, such as
acorns or mesquite beans; 2) a locally abundant food, such
as she! If ish; and 3) incipient agriculture producing a
smal I harvest. These have in common the provision of a food
supply that enables the community to remain in one place for
weeks or months. It is probable that except in the case of
a natural resource like fish or shel !fish, which furnishes
an inexhaustible local fresh food supply, this community
pattern depends on one of two kinds of
advance
in
subsistence techniques: domestication of plants or methods
of food preparation... (Beardsley et al. 1956:138).
The incorporation of these three sources into the subsistence system
of the aboriginal inhabitants of Aqui I la Lake is not well documented,
despite the lengthy consideration of subsistence patterns 1n the
catchment analysis.
None of these three key food sources can be completely discounted
ejther in Aqui I la Lake or Central Texas as a whole. As Jelks {1962)
and Prewitt (1981) have pointed out, the presence of corn cobs in the
Toyah phase suggests that these people at least knew of horticulture,
if they did not practice it.
While no evidence exists for the
domestication of plant species in Texas prior to the Late Prehistoric,
the initial period of discovery and experimentation with cultigens may
have lasted many centuries or mi I lenia with almost no physical
evidence, given the rarity of preserved botanical samples from Central
Texas sites.
Certainly the consumption, and perhaps the storage, of
acorns and mesquite beans may have been a common practice in Texas for
many mi I lenia, although to what degree this may have influenced
potential sedentism is beyond speculation. The most uni ikely of the
three, at least in the Aquil la Lake area, is a locally abundant food
source such as fish or she! lfish.
The dimunitive size of both
Hackberry and Aqui I la creeks makes it uni ikely that either would
support a sizeable fish or shel Ifish population. The extreme scarcity
of fish remains at Aqui I la sites, although perhaps partially due to
poor preservation, seems to argue against the role of fish. Data from
the McKenzie Site suggest that even the largest she I I middens yet
observed in the project area would not support a medium size band for
more than a few days.
In a later section of his review, Gallagher (1978) points out
several deficiencies of the evaluation of the Central-Based Wanderer

exaggerated diachronic lumping used in the analysis. It is indeed
difficult to accept the accuracy of a settlement subsistence model
tested with sites that can be dated to no better than the Archaic
Period. Secondly, he point out the eschewal by Skinner et al. (1978)
of the common sense concept that most large sites are simply the
48-39

FINAL SUMMARY
result of multiple reoccupations in favor of the tenuous assumption
that site size is necessarily related to a site's placement in the
synchronic settlement pattern.
In general, the evidence gathered during the final three seasons
of investigations at Aqui I la Lake supports Gallagher's criticisms.
Few sites do not show evidence of mixed multicomponent occupations.
This is particularly true of the larger sites such as the Brazi I and
Sul I ivan sites, which by their size would be considered Central-Based
Wanderer base camps.
Even many of the smaller sites, such as the
Bailey and Pi I grim sites, show evidence of uti I ization during several
different time periods.
Only the McDonald Site contained stratified cultural remains with
preserved fauna I materials that might yield some pre I iminary data
useful in testing the Skinner model. Two other sites, the McKenzie
and Brazi I sites, yielded discrete archeological components. At the
Brazi I Site, the sample of material from the Early Archaic levels is
miniscule and contains no information on subsistence or seasonality.
This component simply serves to emphasize the extensive use of the
site by diverse groups throughout the Archaic Period. The McKenzie
Site, with its mussel shel I midden, provided some
interesting
information on the possible range of group sizes and on the limited
potential for mussels as a stable food source in the Aqui I la Lake
area.
Despite the lack of diagnostics and the difficulties in
precisely dating the site, it would not be surprising to find such a
I imited activity food processing site present in any time period along
Aqui I la or Hackberry creeks, and its presence in no way affirms or
detracts from either the Central-Based or the Restricted Wanderer
model.
The McDonald Site, on the other hand, while providing some
excellent data on subsistence resources and cultural succession, is
only a single I imited site, insufficient by itself to validate or
invalidate the models. Prior to the Late Prehistoric at the McDonald
Site, there seems to be I ittle evidence of campsites reflecting
lengthy occupations, although the ethnoarcheological evidence which
one might expect from a lengthy stay at a hunter and gatherer campsite
is unclear.
Beardsley et al. (1956:139) suggest that Central-Based
Wanderer sites may have thicker midden accumulations than sites of
either
the Restricted Wanderer or the Semi-Permanent Sedentary
community types. The relatively thick accumulations in the Late
Prehistoric cultural layers at the McDonald Site seem to fit this
criteria. It is possible, however, that increased storage technology,
perhaps related to the introduction of ceramics, or knowledge of
horticulture, or even a temporarily abundant local resource such as a
whitetai I deer overpopulation, may have contributed to more permanent
stays at the site.
It 1s perhaps equally I ikely that, due to
48-40

FINAL SUMMARY
increased mobi I ity or increased population density, the site was
occupied more frequently during this period rather than for any longer
a length of time.
An important issue here that has been somewhat overlooked is the
ultimate uti I ity of testing the Seminars~ Archaeology model in this
manner.
Few archeologists would disagree with the ethnographic
reality of the general model proposed by Beardsley and his colleagues
(with the possible exception of the Free Wanderer community).
But
what the Skinner test of this model fai Is to emphasize is that these
community models are ideal types proposed at relatively arbitrary
points along a continuum (in keeping with the evolutionary perspective
of Beardsley et al.). A more proper usage of such a model might be in
a comparative sense; such as an analysis that sought to characterize
the Late Prehistoric as more or less mobile than the Late Archaic,
particularly if linked to a factor identified as the theoretical cause
of such a change. Although perhaps it would be as difficult to prove
as the base camp model.
It is argued here that the emphasis on cultural change and
c6ntinuity, and comparative studies provide more useful archeological
data than studies that seek to classify and pigeonhole.
A classic
example from another realm of archeology is found in projectile point
typology.
Despite the fact that the increasingly more precise
typological identification of projectile points can provide important
data, particularly in the definition of areal and temporal ranges of
prehistoric cultures, it wi I I ultimately be important to recognize the
arbitrariness of many typological categories and look at regional and
temporal variations in technological and sty I istic trends. Clearly,
the goal of the archeologist is not to provide names for various
phenomena, but to understand the dynamics of those phenomena and their
potential causes.
Such an approach is seemingly basic to the
understanding of aboriginal settlement patterns.
7) TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES IN THE AQUILLA LAKE
AREA AND TO EXAMINE, IF POSSIBLE, THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE STRATEGIES
TO THOSE OF SURROUNDING AREAS.
In a previous section, the prehistoric inhabitants of Aqui I la
Lake have been dealt with as participants in the larger cultural
traditions of adjacent broad cultural areas.
While recent evidence
from the !Kung bushmen studies has suggested that some items of
material culture, such as arrow point styles, may correlate with
larger groups than the band (Weissner 1983), there is no suggestion
here or there that any single item or smal I group of items of material
culture wi I I correlate with a particular economic adaptation. It is
thus important to ask, after having addressed the question of larger
48-41

FINAL SUMMARY
cultural traditions, what 1s the evidence for particular adaptive
strategies in the Aqui I la Lake area?
Was there a specialized
adaptation localized along the Aqui I la Creek drainage? Or was there a
broader, less specialized adaptation present throughout the Central
Brazos or even al I of North Central Texas? Or, if such adaptations
cannot be clearly isolated, what are some of the environmental
parameters which might have defined such an adaptation?
Shafer and Bryant (1977) have proposed two adaptive strategies
for the North Fork and Granger reservoirs on the San Gabriel River in
Wi I li~mson County. While Wi I I iamson County and the San Gabriel River
are many miles to the south, they share with Aqui I la Lake and Hi I I
County the role of transitional area between the Edwards Plateau and
the Blackland Prairie.
In other words, both archeological project
areas are located on the extreme eastern edge of the Central Texas
culture area.
The first of these adaptive strategies 1s termed the Prairie
Centered Adaptation.
This model proposes an adaptation centered
around the gallery forests along the major streams of the Black land
Prairie in which prehistoric groups ranged east and west to exploit
the resources of the Post Oak Savannah and the Edwards Plateau.
As
Moore, Shafer and Weed (1978:72-77) point out, the model imp I ies that
none of these zones could support a population throughout the annual
subsistence cycle.
Peter and Hays (1982:19-5) suggest that this
assumption may not be val id, that the resources of the pra1r1e alone
could have supported a group throughout the year.
The second model, considered the least I ikely of the two
alternatives (Moore, Shafer and Weed 1978:75), is termed the Prairie
Ecotone Adaptation. In this model, the Blackland Prairie is seen as
the boundary or ecotone between adaptations centered in the Edwards
Plateau and the Post Oak Savannah. Although they find some evidence
for contact with culture areas to the south and east, on the East
Texas Coastal Plain, as indicated by the occurrence of coastal shel Is
and sandy paste ceramics after 1750 B.P., Peter and Hays (1982:19-8)
suggest that what I ittle is known about specific Post Oak Savannah
adaptations (see Mal louf 1979) does not strongly support this model.
While the different nature of the biotic zones of the Aqui I la
Lake area precludes the exact correspondence of these models, they can
be translated into para I lel forms that may serve to explain locally
viable adaptations. Such a translation generates two basic forms, an
adaptation centered upon the Cross Timbers region, dividing resource
procurement time between the bottomland hardwood forests and the
upland oak savannah areas, and adaptations to the east and west that
jointly exploit the resources of the Cross Timbers area. This latter
model imp I ies that the Cross Timbers might become a zone of contention
48-42

FINAL SUMMARY
between groups, as the Blackland Prairie would in the Granger region
(Peter and Hays 1982:19-4). There is no evidence for such contention
and I ittle suggestion that the avai I able resources of the Cross
Timbers region would have been worth fighting over.
Although Lynott 1 s (1977) characterization of the
Blackland
Prairie
uplands
as
a
"sea of inedible grasses" may be an
overstatement, it seems uni ikely that the resources of the pra1r1e
uplands were sufficient by themselves to support a prehistoric group
of any size throughout its annual cycle. A group determined to remain
within the pra1r1e ecotone would have been tethered to one of the
larger floodpain riparian forests that cross the prairie. Streams of
sufficient size to maintain even a smal I group seem widely spread to
the east of the Aqui I la Lake area.
While the Black land Prairie
adjacent to Aquil la Lake may be somewhat wider than that found in the
Granger Lake area, it seems less I ikely that a true Prairie Centered
Adaptation would be a viable alternative in the Aqui I la region.
On the other hand, a localized adaptation between the Edwards
Plateau and the Post Oak Savannah may have centered upon the Cross
Timbers and the southward flowing Aquil la Creek with its substantial
gallery forest and floodplain. Aside from the presence of the Cross
Timbers biotic zone (which also runs north-south), one of the major
differences between the Granger-North Fork area and the Aqui I la Lake
area is the east to southeasterly flow direction of the major streams
in the former and the southward flow in the latter.
Thus the model replacing the Prairie Centered Adaptation in the
Aqui I la Lake area is one centered upon the Cross Timbers and Aquil la
In the
Creek. Two possible versions of this adaptive model exist.
first, the adaptation is centered upon Aqui I la Creek, ranging westward
to the Brazos River and eastward through the Blackland Prairie to the
Post Oak Savannah region.
This model 1 adapted to a basically
east-west seasonal subsistence territory, is termed the Aqui I la
Centered Model.
A second model proposes that populations ranged the
length of Aqui I la Creek, foraging in the immediately adjacent upland
areas but only rarely venturing to the Brazos or very far east into
the Blackland Prairie area.
It is possible to envision a Prairie Ecotone Adaptation occurring
within the Aqui I la Lake region. Certainly, if the prairie were not
the center of a particular adaptation, it would seem uni ikely that it
were not uti I ized at al I.
The above defined model termed Aqui I la
Centered is in reality a version of this ecotonal model.
Another
possibl ity considered here is the Cross Timbers and Aqui I la Creek as a
cultural ecotone between prehistoric groups adapted to the Brazos
River on the west and to either the Blackland Prairie or Post Oak
Savannah on the east. As already mentioned, a specific Blackland
48-43

FINAL SUMMARY
Prairie adaptation seems uni ikely except along major east-west pra1r1e
tributaries such as Richland-Chambers Creek to the northeast of the
project area.
Additionally, it is unclear whether or not the
resources would have been sufficiently different or plentiful enough
to draw groups from the Post Oak Savannah across the Blackland
Prairie.
Such an argument might be made for the Brazos River adapted
groups.
There is I ittle evidence that any particular resource
avai I able within the Cross Timbers area or the Aqui I la Creek drainage
was plentiful enough or scheduled differently enough to be attractive
to people who I ived in a zone of relatively dense resources.
Skinner
and Henderson (1972) had originally proposed that the prehistoric
inhabitants of Aqui I la Lake were based along the Brazos River,
foraging seasonally into the Aqui I la drainage area. Upon examination
of the data regarding base camps versus seasonal foraging stations,
Lynott and Peter (1977) suggested that the converse could be possible
since the largest sites along Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks were larger
than those closer to the Brazos. In any case, the argument for a
localized Aqui I la Creek or Cross Timbers adaptation was opened.
In the catchment analysis chapter, it was determined that the
avai I able resources of the Aqui I la Lake catchment area could support a
fairly large population. Potential population estimates ranged from
372 upward to 7602 persons. Estimated resource potential of the Cross
Timbers (including 1,640 ha. of bottom land) is 10,438.7 mi I I ion
ki localories, while the Black land Prairie zone (resources tal I ies are
exclusively from bottomland riparian forest) potential is estimated at
only 471.l mi I I ion ki localories. The differences in productivity are
immediately obvious. The 15,200 hectares of Cross Timbers land in the
Aqui I la Lake catchment area have an average production potential of
.69 ki localories per hectare, while the 15,840 hectares of Black land
Prairie are projected to yield only .03 ki localories per hectare.
This yields a 23:1 ratio of production by the Cross Timbers to that of
the Blackland Prairie.
Clearly, the Blackland Prairie 1s less
attractive in terms of overal I resource potential.
Another way of looking at the differences is to examine them in
terms of the adaptation models. The catchment area, with a total area
of 314.16 square kilometers, produces 10,909.8 mi I I ion ki localories
annually.
An equivalent area contained totally within the Cross
Timbers would produce about twice that,
or
21,576.5
mi I I ion
ki localories.
A corresponding area of Black land Prairie would only

population in the pure Blackland Prairie would require a larger
subsistence range. To support a population of the same size as might
be found at carrying capacity level in the Aqui I la Lake catchment area
would require an area 23 times greater, or 7,225.68 square kilometers,
48-44

FINAL SUMMARY
a catchment circle with a radius of 48.0 kilometers.
Such a
calculation is somewhat misleading, however. While the Cross Timbers
resources are spread across the landscape, the Blackland Prairie
resources are confined primarily to riparian forests along stream
drainages.
To produce the same amount of potential annual resources
as the Aqui I la Lake catchment area, stream drainage some 974.1
kilometers 1n length would be needed. This strongly suggests that a
true Prairie centered adaptation, relying totally
on
riparian
resources within the pra1r1e zone is not possible in the Aquil la
Central Brazos area. However, the data analyzed has yet to provide a
clear choice between the two versions of the Aqui I la centered model.
Given the apparent surplus avai I able in the Cross Timbers area,
the potential differential may be of less importance than is apparent.
It seems uni ikely that the population of the catchment area ever
exceeded 1000, much less 7000, at any one time. Even the lower
estimate of 372 persons may be high for a permanent population
confined to this area. The area may have been inhabited by only a few
smal I bands existing at wel I below carrying capacity.
Further
quantitative analysis of food remains from sites in the area wi I I be
necessary to reduce the speculative nature of the population parameter
estimates given here.
The adaptive models discussed here, however val id they may be,
are primarily static models.
Peter and Hays (1982), in their
discussion of the adaptations through time in the North Fork and
Granger Lake areas, suggest that it is unrealistic to expect a single
model to remain val id throughout the entire Prehistoric Period. Given
evidence
for
at
least minor climatic changes throughout the
Prehistoric Period, some changes should be expected. As discussed in
the chapter on the culture history of the Aqui I la Lake area, there is
some evidence for shifting spheres of cultural influence through time.
For the most part, this evidence seems to indicate very early and very
late participation in the broad cultural traditions of Central and
East Texas, with some degree of independence during the Middle and
portions of the Late Archaic.
It may be that home ranges of
prehistoric groups narrowed considerably during these latter periods.
Although no maJor adaptive changes are documented
during
the
Prehistoric Period of Central Texas, such range shifts may indicate
subtle changes in adaptive strategies.
It is al I but impossible for the archeologist to track the
remains of a single band.
As Weissner (1983) has pointed out,
material culture alone may not be sufficient to distinguish between
separate bands.
Only broader adaptations retain any degree of
visibility. Nonetheless, these broader adaptations may give clues to
the maximum I imits of band territories within a region.

48-45

FINAL SUMMARY
Gunn and Prewitt (1984) have discussed the possible changing
patterns of Central Texas cultures in their broad ecotone model. This
model views the Central Texas culture area as having a changing
environment that tends to promote alterations to adaptive strategies.
In their model, the broad ecotone of Central Texas is a climatically
unstable area which, uni ike the narrow ecotone that promotes the
development of complex cultures, tends to inhibit long term cultural
development.
Gunn and Prewitt's model is tied to both the Primary Forest
Efficiency model of Caldwel I (1958) and the Focal-Diffuse adaptive
model of Cleland (1976), as wel I as to the model of tethered nomadism
proposed by Taylor (1964). They propose a series of maximum ranges
for each of the phases of Prewitt's (1981) cultural chronology of
Central
Texas
and the correlation between each of these and
interpreted climatic changes is examined.
Gunn and Prewitt (1984)
describe the climate of the Late Prehistoric as primarily cool and
dry, with a warm, moist spike during the late Austin phase.
The
estimated mean northern hemisphere temperatures are at their coolest
since the Pleistocene during the mid-Toyah phase. Ranges during the
Late Prehistoric are at their maximum to the north, east and south.
The early Late Archaic (San Marcos and early Uvalde phase) is warm and
moist with a cool dry interval peaking at the beginning of the Twin
Sisters phase and becoming hot and dry during the Driftwood phase.
Cultural ranges of the Late Archaic are average during the middle
phases and constricted during the Driftwood and San Marcos phases.
The Middle Archaic begins with a cool dry interval which peaks in the
late Clear Fork, while a major hot and dry interval peaks at the
transition between the Marshal I Ford and Round Rock phases. Ranges of
the later phases are moderate, but the early Clear Fork phase is
constricted.
Climates during the Early Archaic range from warm and
moist to hot and dry, with the warmest average temperature of the
entire Archaic Period fal I ing at the beginning of the Jarrel I phase.
Another warm peak, the tai I end of a long late Pleistocene warming
trend, occurs at the beginning of the Circleville phase. Ranges are
narrowly constricted during the later portion of the Early Archaic,
while the Circlevi I le phase range expands to nearly the extreme width
of the Late Prehistoric.
These Central Texas ranges can be examined from the perspective
of the presence of Central Texas materials in the Aqui I la Lake area.
A scan of Figure 9 in Gunn and Prewitt (1984) suggests the fol lowing
predictions.
Those Central Texas phases least I ikely to be heavily
represented in the Aqui I la area, in the approximate order of distance,
are Oakal la, Jarrel I, San Marcos, Driftwood and Clear Fork. After the
Late Prehistoric phases and the San Geronimo and Circlevi I le phases,
those predicted as most I ikely to be present are Round Rock, Marshal I
Ford and Uvalde.
48-46

FINAL SUMMARY
Examination of the sample of projectile points from the Aqui I la
Lake area shows that there is no evidence of the diagnostic artifacts
of the Oakal la or Clear Fork phases and only minimal evidence of any
from the San Marcos phase. Projectile points I inked to the Driftwood
Round
and Jarrel I phases are present, though not in great numbers.
Rock and Marshal I Ford, and to a lesser degree, Uvalde phase
projectile points seem to be somewhat more prominent, but the overal I
numbers are sti I I smal I. The presence of projectile points from both
the early portion of the Early Archaic (San Geronimo and Circlevi lie)
and the Late Prehistoric (Austin and Toyah) is wel I documented in and
around the project area.
The projectile point sample seems to indicate that, with the
exception of the Late Prehistoric, extension of Central Texas cultures
into the Aqui I la Lake area was at its maximum during hot and dry
intervals, such as the Early Archaic and mid-Middle Archaic. Both
warm moist and cool dry intervals saw the least northward extension
from Central Texas.
It is possible that the resources of the Cross
Timbers may have drawn groups from other areas in hot, dry times when
much of Central Texas may have been relatively unproductive grasslands
away from the major drainages.
It is easy to envision different adaptive strategies emerging
during different climates, strongly I inked to varying population
densities and resource depletion pressures.
During cool or moist
periods, population densities may have been lowered, with less
pressure on the resources from marginal groups. A true Cross Timbers
centered adaptation may have arisen during these periods. It may be
during the cool dry interval of the mid-Late Archaic that the
apparently locally centered Godley projectile point may have first
come into use. During warmer and drier periods, adaptations may have
ranged farther along the peripheral drainages of the Blackland
Prairie, not only to maximize the use of resources in hard times, but
to increase spacing between band territory centers with increased
population density. The resources of the uplands of the Cross Timbers
would be shared, but from home range territories that extended out
across the prairie.
8) TO EVALUATE THE BASIC CULTURAL
PROPOSED FOR THE AQUILLA LAKE AREA.

AND

CHRONOLOGICAL

FRAMEWORK

The science of archeology has grown by leaps and bounds 1n the
last few decades.
The infusion of a new spirit of scientific
discovery from the "new archeology" of the 1960s and the influx of new
blood and growth of the archeological community, due in part to the
rapid growth of contract archeology, have vastly increased the total
amount of archeological data collected, and opened new theoretical

48-47

FINAL SUMMARY
perspectives on typical data as wel I as spurring the attempt to
analyze and collect new and different types of data. The increasing
avai labi I ity of computers and sophisticated analytical techniques from
other scientific disciplines have also aided the growth of the
discipline.
The increasing sophistication of theoretical perspectives and the
emphasis on complex modeling techniques does not, however, spel I the
end of the more traditional types of archeological analysis.
Such
basic analyses are primary data, without which the more sophisticated
analyses are worth I ittle. It is one thing to discuss settlement
patterns or adaptive strategies at Aqui I la Lake, for example, but only
the most naive of analysts would ignore potential temporal changes 1n
those strategies.
Studies of cultural and temporal change remain as important today
as ever, and the vast amounts of data being gathered by contract
programs across the country
have
assisted
in
refining
our
understanding
of
the cultural and temporal parameters of the
Prehistoric Period. In Central Texas, the brief article by Prewitt
(1981), building upon the earlier elaboration proposed by Weir (1976),
is an excel lent attempt to provide a narrowly defined cultural
chronology.
While
the ultimate dependence of the model upon
projectile points as key index markers may draw criticism from some,
the phase descriptions make it clear that Prewitt is primarily
interested in the cultural adaptations during those periods.
The
proposed phases may or may not stand the test of time, but such
carefully defined periods are critical for the understanding of
cultural adaptations that are otherwise I imited to vague generalities
when dealing with broadly defined periods such as Middle or Late
Archaic.
Carefully defined phases may I imit the scope of culture area
analyses, however.
While it is not difficult to discuss the Middle
Archaic of the Aqui I la Lake region in the context of the Central Texas
Middle Archaic, for example, the Middle Archaic phases defined by
Prewitt do not easily extend into the Aqui I la area, as is shown in the
chapter on the culture history of the Aqui I la Lake area. Some
important similarities exist, but the differences appear to be
significant.
Unfortunately,
the paucity of sol idly documented
stratigraphic excavations in the area render the creation of local
phases difficult.
The discussion in the chapter on culture history
was necessarily somewhat tenuous, grounded 1n Prewitt's chronology,
but distinct from it.
The critical importance of setting
up
a
sol id
culture
chronological framework has been emphasized throughout this report.
One of the major deficiencies seen in the previous SMU work in the

48-48

FINAL SUMMARY
Aqui I la Lake area is the failure to achieve this goal. Of course,
this failure does not necessarily stem from the particular research
orientation of the SMU work, but rather the lack of archeological
sites with separable components. SMU was forced to rely wholly upon
comparison
with
other
regions.
This
unfortunate
situation
considerably weakened the strength of the cultural conclusions.
The discovery of stratified components at the McDonald Site was
hardly sufficient to redefine the local cultural chronology. Only a
handful of key index marker projectile points were recovered from the
deep 2 by 2 excavation unit that penetrated the Archaic deposits at
the site. A re-examination of the Aqui I la Lake sites and comparison
of some of the projectile points recovered from surface and mixed
layers at these sites were important, however, in the construction of
some very general ideas about the prehistory of the Aqui I la Lake area.
These ideas were presented in the chapter on Aqui I la Lake culture
history.
The major conclusions of that chapter are very briefly
summarized below with a few additional comments on related issues
touched upon in this final chapter.
PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Three Paleoindian Period sites were noted 1n the Aqui I la Lake
area.
The Sul I ivan Site (41HI117), which yielded a number of
Plainview, Plainview-I ike and other apparent early lanceolate points,
is probably the most important. The private collection from this site
contains a remarkable number of late Paleoindian and Early Archaic
lanceolate points.
Why this site should have been such an important locus for
Paleoindian activities is unclear, but as Shiner (1983) has pointed
out, sites with multiple Paleoindian projectile points are not rare,
and
may
represent
more
permanent
settlements
or
frequent
reoccupations. H.D. Sul I ivan, the previous site owner, noted that
there was an active spring in Aqui I la Creek near the site that only
infrequently dried up, if ever. The presence of a spring appears to
support Shiner's hypothesis concerning the importance of springs to
Paleoindian settlement patterns. On the other hand, the location of
the Sul I ivan Site may be unique in the project area as much by
geomorphic accident as by cultural design, and may simply represent
one of the few such intermediate terraces left undestroyed by f luvial
action.
Other Paleoindian points were found at 41HI167 and 41HI195.
A
reworked Plainview found at the Brazi I Site (41HI75) was thought to be
in an Early Archaic context and not included in the Paleoindian
materials.
The reported fluted projectile point from 41HI195 was
unidentified and uncollected, while the specimen from 41HI167 1s
48-49

FINAL SUMMARY
tentatively identified as a Brazos Fishtai I type (see Watt 1978), a
mid-Paleoindian type possibly related to Dalton, Meserve, San Patrice
and perhaps Rodgers side hollowed points from the southern Plains.
The significance of the recovery of this type in apparent greater
numbers
than
the possibly contemporaneous Folsom suggests the
dominance of woodland adapted cultures in the Central Brazos at this
time. It is suggested here that the Aqui I la Lake area might have been
the locus of a cultural adaptation different than that of the main
Central
Texas
culture
area
to
the south and west 1n the
mid-Paleoindian Period, and only became a sol id part of the Central
Texas culture area during the time of the later Paleoindian lanceolate
projectile point cultures.
EARLY ARCHAIC PERIOD
Seven Early Archaic components were identified at Aqui I la Lake
sites.
During this period, similarities to the Central Texas culture
area are relatively obvious. As pointed out in the previous section,
the hot, dry climate of this period may be partly responsible for the
apparent extended range of the Central Texas cultures. In addition to
the Sul I ivan Site, where Early Archaic diagnostics can be observed in
the collection of the former landowner, the Brazi I Site (41HI75)
contains
an
Early Archaic component that has yielded several
diagnostic specimens. The significance of the Brazi I Site 1s the
apparent stratigraphic separation of Early Archaic materials between
60 and 90 centimeters depth below the surface in Excavation Unit 22.
The soi I 1n this unit suggests that the archeological materials are
buried in a low alluvial terrace, perhaps similar to the formation at
the Sul Ii van Site.
Circlevi I le phase diagnostics have been recovered from 41HI110,
41HI146, 41HI117, and, possibly, 41HI75. One site, the Brazi I Site,
has yielded unquestionable diagnostics from the San Geronimo phase,
and two other sites, the Bailey Site (41HI77) and 41HI169, have
yielded possible specimens. Tentative Jarrel I phase diagnostics have
been recovered from only three sites: 41Hl110, 41HI156 and 41HI195.
No diagnostics of the Oakal la phase have been recovered.
Little can be said of the Early Archaic in the Aqui I la Lake area
except that there are marked similarities to the Central Texas culture
area. Only the presence of the Wei Is type, which occurs infrequently
throughout the eastern portion of Central Texas, suggests influences
beyond the Central Texas region. Certainly, no indigenous adaptation
is obvious in the diagnostic artifacts. Despite the recovery of a
stratified Early Archaic component, I ittle is known of adaptations
during this period in the Aqui I la area, partially because of the
insufficient sampling of this critically important zone, but also
because of the lack of preservation of fauna! remains.
48-50

FINAL SUMMARY
MIDDLE ARCHAIC PERIOD
The Middle Archaic of the Aqui I la Lake area is notable in the
apparent absence of the feature so diagnostic of this time period in
Central Texas proper, the burned rock midden.
Despite this lack,
Central Texas Middle Archaic diagnostics are definitely present, if
not in great quantities. The early portion of the Central Texas
MiddleÂ· Archaic, marked by an apparent cool dry interval, is not
represented in the project area; no diagnostics from the Clear Fork
phase have been recovered.
Because of problems inherent in the
identification of simple straight stemmed projectile points such as
the Bulverde type, it is difficult to be certain how many sites might
be representative of the Marshal I Ford phase. Two, the Aldridge Site
(41HI195) and 41HI128, are relatively certain, while possible examples
are also found at the Bailey Site, 41HI110 and 41HI130. Although the
classlc large bladed Pedernales projectile point of Central Texas is
not present, specimens representing probable variants of this type
have been recovered from 41HI110, 41HI170, the Bailey Site, 41HI174,
41HI177 and the McDonald Site. A single smal I Marshal I point from
41HI163 is the primary evidence for San Marcos phase occupations in
the area, but smal I broad stemmed specimens from the Bailey Site, the
Aldridge Site and 41HI161 may also date to the end of the Middle
Archaic.
The evidence suggests the Middle Archaic in the Aqui I la Lake area
may have been a time of some population expansion, at least into the
locality from other areas.
Weir's (1976) suggestion of increased
population during the Middle Archaic agrees with this. And if the
artifactual materials from surface and upland sites show some increase
in Middle Archaic occupations, evidence from the McDonald Site
suggests that some Middle Archaic components may be deeply buried in
the floodplain and essentially invisible.
It is possible that if
these components were located, the Middle Archaic population of the
lake area would be as large or larger than that of the succeeding Late
Archaic. While the evidence suggests that Central Texas influences
were strong during this period, the first clear signs of influences
from outside the Central Texas culture area are seen in the presence
of Carrol I ton and Dawson projectile points from the north and east
respectively. Only an insignificant part of the total Middle Archaic
sample, they nonetheless foreshadow stronger influences in later
times.
LATE ARCHAIC PERIOD
Skinner et al. (1978) have suggested that the Late Archaic was a
time of population growth in the Aqui I la Lake area, and if the total
number of projectile points collected is any indication,
this
hypothesis may be on the mark. If the majority of contracting stenvned
48-51

FINAL SUMMARY
projectile points were typed as Gary and dated to the Late Archaic
Period, the Late Archaic totals would equal almost al I other periods
combined. The trend toward diminution in projectile point size noted
in Central Texas proper (Johnson, Suhm and Tunnel I 1962) appears to be
noticeable in the smaller projectile points of the Aqui I la Lake Late
Archaic.
Central Texas influences are not strong during this period,
being overshadowed by the influx of contracting stemmed specimens from
the north and east.
Although dated somewhat earlier than Prewitt (1981) indicates, a
Castrovi I le-I ike specimen from the deep Archaic zones at the McDonald
Site may mark influence from the Uvalde phase of Central Texas, as
might also similar specimens from the Aldridge Site. The suceeding
Twin Sisters phase is represented only by a single crude Ensor point
from the Brazi I Site.
The later Driftwood phase, howe~is more
strongly represented, with key index markers found at four sites in
the lake area.
These are McDonald Site, Brazi I Site, Pi I grim Site
(41HI124) and 41HI130.
In addition to the evidence of Central Texas projectile points
and the quantity of contracting stem forms from the lake area, an
indigeneous type seems to be present in the Godley.
First named at
the Kyle Site on Lake Whitney (Jelks 1962), it is a common type on the
east bank of the Brazos River above Waco and may represent a locally
adapted group.
If Gunn and Prewitt (1984) are right in their estimation of the
Central Texas paleocl imates, then the Late Archaic was marked by a
cool dry interval, peaking just after 2000 8.P., and the final brief
hot dry interval of the last three mi I lenia peaking around 1450 B.P.
It was noted that intrusions from Central Texas apparently tended to
occur during hot dry intervals, perhaps in response to the loss of
woodland areas in Central Texas and the attractiveness of the Cross
Timbers with its slightly greater annual precipitation. The cool dry
interval of the Late Archaic may also mark the peak of eastern
influence into the Aqui I la Lake area, although there are strong
eastern influences obvious during the cool dry interval of the Toyah
phase of the Late Prehistoric.
LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Both phases of the Late Prehistoric are wel I represented in the
Aqui I la Lake area.
At least eight sites in the lake area (McDonald
Site, Pi !grim Site, Bai fey Site, Reps Davis Site, Sul I ivan Site,
41HI107, 41HI110 and 41HI157) yielded Seal lorn arrow points diagnostic
of the earlier Austin phase, with apparent significant components
represented only at the Bailey and Pi Igrim sites.
Toyah phase
diagnostic artifacts were recovered from only four sites:
McDonald
48-52

FINAL SUMMARY
Site, Pi Igrim Site, Bailey Site and Aldridge Site. In addition,
ceramics probably dating to this phase were recovered from 41HI109,
41HI111, 41HI134 and 41HI154.
Since excavations at the Kyle Site on Lake Whitney
were
instrumental in the original definition of the Late Prehistoric Austin
and Toyah phases (Jelks 1962), it is no surprise that the Late
Prehistoric materials from Aqui I la Lake are clearly related to typical
materials from the defined phases.
These phases are, of course,
widespread across Central Texas and may represent the greatest
territorial expansion of any material culture expression since the
late Paleoindian or very early Early Archaic (see Gunn and Prewitt
1984). Not al I of the Late Prehistoric materials from Aqui Ila Lake
fit so easily into the phase definitions, however. While there is
strong evidence for a Toyah phase component in Area A of the McDonald
Site, the Late Prehistoric materials from Area B are somewhat
atypical. The main Late Prehistoric zone in this area contains no
good examples of Perdiz or Cliffton projectile points, but rather a
number of miscellaneous stemmed arrow points, some of which are
reminiscent of the Alba type from East Texas.
Comparison of some of the materials excavated from the McDonald
Site with some important Central Brazos Late Prehistoric collections
such as those from the Chupik and Asa Warner sites suggests that the
Late Prehistoric of the Central Brazos may be more complex than the
two widely defined phases. Much or al I of this complexity is related
to possible Caddoan intrusions into the area. It has been suggested
here that Caddoan ceramics in the Central Brazos may come from a
number of sources including trade, hunting group loss and local
manufacture. The timing of these intrusions and the direction from
which they came is sti I I a matter for some analysis. Pottery types
recovered from the Central Brazos suggests several different time
periods and several different loci of origin.
The nature of the Late Prehistoric adaptation in the Central
Brazos 1s not clear. Faunal remains from the McDonald Site indicate
that bison were present in the general area, at least during the Toyah
phase, but it is not clear to what degree they were an important food
resource. Certainly, bison are uni ikely to have been found in any
frequency in the Cross Timbers region. Bison hunters may have camped
along the edges of the Cross Timbers and in the riparian forests of
the tributary drainages of the Black land Prairie to maximize deer ki I I
while searching for bison on the Black land Prairie uplands.
It 1s
unclear whether the presence of ceramics in the Central Brazos area
signified new adaptations or simply new technology within the same
adaptation.
Sites such as the Chupik and Asa Warner sites could have
been smal I semi-permanent vi I lages.

48-53

FINAL SUMMARY
CONCLUSIONS
In retrospect, the Central Texas culture chronological framework
previously uti I ized to describe the prehistory of the Aquil la Lake
area seems inadequate. Although Central Texas influences are present
throughout the prehistoric, they appear to be strong only very early
and very late. Even during the Paleoindian and Late Prehistoric
periods, where similarities with Central Texas are at a maximum, there
are some important eastern influences. During much of the Archaic, on
the other hand, Central Texas influence is minimal. At times, such as
during the Late Archaic, the influences from the north and east are
strong.
The
use
of a North Central or East Texas culture
chronological model in the description of cultures from the Aqui I la
Lake area would be equally problematical, however.
While the Aqui I la Lake area has accepted influences from al I
surrounding regions throughout the prehistoric, it cannot be clearly
identified with any of those regions. Nor is the mixture of cultural
influences constant through time. Elsewhere in the report the concept
of the Aqui I la Lake area as a boundary region between major culture
areas has been introduced.
This concept is emphasized again here.
The recognition of this concept and the awareness of the potential for
interaction of shifting external cultural influences with local
adaptations wi I I aid greatly in future understanding of the prehistory
of this smal I portion of the Central Brazos area.
The goals of the Aqui I la Lake project have been relatively simple
and straightforward.
They have not al I been achieved with equal
success, a notion obvious upon reading this final chapter. While this
is partly due to shifting orientiations ~hroughout the seasons of the
project, it is also due to the choice of the goals themselves.
A
simply stated goal may not be so simple to reach. It is easy, for
example, to discuss culture contact and exchange with other regions,
but when it comes down to hard numbers and figures, archeological data
are rarely sufficient to
provide
the
answer.
Sophisticated
multidisciplinary analyses may be necessary to even intelligently
discuss such a topic.
Yet the sophistication of an analysis 1s hardly a guarantee of
success.
Success
1s not guaranteed 1n archeological studies.
Hypotheses may not be determinable one way or the other.
Real world
analyses cannot so readily be set up as a statistical nul I hypothesis,
where the elimination of one possibi I ity automatically points to the
other. Cultural adaptations offer an infinite number of archeological
possibi I ities.

FINAL SUMMARY
This final report on the archeology of Aquil la Lake is a long and
complex volume authored by a number of people over a several year
period. Several of the authors have never met and certainly no one
person has a clear perspective on the entire project. The report
contains contradictions, some simply due to different points of view
among the authors, and undoubtedly errors, many of which wi I I be
pointed out the day after final pub I ication.
A large number of
speculations and informal hypotheses are presented throughout the
report. Many of these are rather uni ikely, while some are so obvious
that they may be accepted without formal proof. The object of these
speculations, however, is not to pretend an understanding of the
prehistory of the Aqui I la Lake area, but to offer suggestions for
further research in the nearby area.
As noted above, some of the speculations are tenuous and wi I I no
doubt be met with healthy skepticism.
Such dubious speculations
actually have the advantage since sometimes, the more outrageous the
idea, the more energy is expended in trying to prove or disprove it.
It is sincerely hoped that the data contained in this report is of use
to generate new ideas and to add confirmation to older ones that the
authors overlooked. Even more, it is hoped that some of the ideas
contained herein might generate some argument and foster new and
carefully directed research.

APPENDIX I
AQUILLA LAKE MANAGEMENT DATA SURVEY

David 0. Brown

As part of the final season of archeological investigations at
Aqui I la Lake, TAS agreed to revisit al I known sites within the project
boundaries and describe the current condition of each.
New site
forms, including both the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory form
and the Texas Natural Resources Information Service/Texas Historic
Commission computer form, were completed. Sites were to be replotted
on USGS maps and aerial photos, and a permanent magnetic datum marker
placed at each site. A complete description of the scope of work for
this phase of the project is found in Appendix II.
This project, referred to here as the Management Data Survey, was
begun 1n November of 1982 and completed in January of 1983. The
project crew varied between two and four persons during this period.
Field work was supervised by this author. A microfiche record of the
original SMU and 1982 TAS survey forms, as wel I as a computer card
copy of the TNRIS forms, were submitted to the Corps of Engineers in
fulf i I lment of this portion of the contract.
This brief appendix
simply summarizes and comments upon the findings of this project.
In 1972, the SMU archeological survey crew reported a total of
125 archeological sites, al I prehistoric (Skinner and Henderson 1972).
During a subsequent survey project by SMU in 1975, many of these
original sites were relocated and several additional sites recorded
(Lynott and Peter 1977). A few additional new sites were added during
the 1977 and 1978 SMU testing and mitigation projects at Aqui I la Lake
(Skinner et al. 1978, ms.). With the exception of a few previously
known sites, al I of these sites had been assigned only SMU trinomial
numbers. When TAS initiated its work at Aqui I la Lake in 1979,
additional attempts were made to relocate some of the sites and
another handful of sites were assigned TARL numbers (see Watson 1982).
Problems in relocating some of the sites both in 1975 and again
in 1979 suggested the possibi I ity of a final serious concentrated
effort at relocation and the placement of
permanent
markers.

I-1

APPENDIX I
Examination of the project maps revealed several sets, some of which
contained alternate plottings for various sites. In some cases, one
or al I of these plottings did not agree with the description of
location given on one or more of the existing SMU site forms.
In
addition
to
the
numerous
plottings, examination of UTM and
latitude-longitude figures yielded yet another set of locations for
some of the sites. Most of the sites were, of course, described and
plotted accurately, but the percentage of errors was high enough to
justify the additional expense of the Management Data resurvey.
Initial attempts at resolving these multiple locations were
occasionally frustrating, particularly when archeological sites were
found at two or more of the locations described for a single site.
Careful examination of the data, however, showed that the original
survey forms were generally accurate, albeit somewhat sketchy.
In
most cases, the description on the site form in combination with the
site survey form map was sufficient, if the USGS plotting was 1n the
general vicinity.
In a few cases, considerable detective work was
required to even reach the general vicinity. In a very few cases, the
information was simply too sketchy and the site could not be
relocated. Interestingly, in some cases the description and plotting
were unmistakable and yet no cultural material could be found after a
thorough search of the area. Such was the case for at least three
unlocated SMU sites, al I of which were visited several times by
different crews with no luck. Al I three were located on recently
plowed high terrace formations that should have afforded minimum depth
and maximum visibility. A few other sites in similar situations
yielded nothing but a few flakes - enough to indicate the presence of
a site but I ittle else. It has been suggested by Watson (1982) and in
this report that these sites may have been "collected away" by the
original survey crew.
The 1982 survey crew visited just about a hundred sites or
previous site locations during the span of the project. Twenty-eight
sites, including al I of those included in this final excavation
report, had previously been assigned TARL numbers. Despite the fact
that a few of these had been subsequently destroyed by construction,
most were easily relocated and visited by the crew. Seventy-five new
TARL numbers were assigned during the survey project (41HI126 to
41HI199).
While the vast majority of these numbers were assigned to
sites which had previously been located by SMU and were subsequently
visited by the TAS crew, a few new sites were discovered and a few
destroyed and unlocated sites were assigned numbers for reference
purposes.
During the resurvey, six sites were newly recorded. These are in
addition to the two new prehistoric and three historic bridge sites
recorded during the 1980 TAS excavation project.
Most of the SMU
I-2

APPENDIX I
sites were located and re-recorded as single TARL sites. In several
cases, SMU sites that could not be easily separated along the original
I ines were grouped into one TARL site. Such combinations of SMU sites
were effected at least six times during the resurvey.
Another six
previously recorded TARL sites had combined SMU sites into a larger
entity. Table I.1 I ists concordances between SMU and TARL numbers and
documents some of the general statistics given above.
The documentation of these sites has provided an important
base I ine datum for the preparation of this report. The archeological
findings of the survey are not significantly different from that
reported tn the series of SMU pub I ications aimed at interpreting
Aqui I la Lake prehistory. However, a few observations on archeological
techniques of data recording and cultural resource management are in
order here. It should be emphasized that these comments are not
directed at SMU, the Corps of Engineers or at any individual
archeologist.
The problems encountered are simply part of the
learning process for archeologist and cultural resource manager alike
and are documented here in the hopes that it may help someone avoid
similar problems in the future.
Several facts regarding the uti I ity of site forms are now clear.
One is that the site map on the reverse side of a form is critical in
relocation, aided by a wel I written description
of
location.
Secondly, USGS map plottings, and particularly UTM coordinates, should
be viewed with great suspicion when they are not corroborated by the
map and description given on the site form. Another important lesson
was that although a six page site form can be a I ittle tiresome at
times, it's wel I worth it if anybody else ever wants to know anything
about that site. By the same token, a computer type site form where
you check off relevant categories of site description is impossible to
use, unless it is supplemented by a written form.
The Management Data Survey was carried out at a time when dam
construction was nearing completion and afforded the surveyors a
unique view of the realities of construction impacts to sites. One of
the most difficult revelations brought about by dam construction was
the enormous number of buried prehistoric sites destroyed by borrow
activities.
The last several years of the project has demonstrated
that much of the floodplain near the confluence of Aqui I la and
Hackberry creeks was underlain by large sites not visible on the
surface of the floodplain.
The fact that fi I I for earthen dam
construction must generally be taken from areas with deep sediments
such as floodplains provides an immediate conf 1 ict for the cultural
resource manager.
Some such sites could be preserved and others
excavated if it were only possible to find them. It is argued here
that a greater emphasis on analysis of geomorphic potential and actual
subsurface testing is a desperate need.

APPENDIX I
An important aspect of the project has been the chance to take a
second look at the resources after testing and excavation programs had
exposed numerous sites in the reservoir area. Knowing the results of
excavation at a few sites made it considerably easier to judge the
potential archeological value of other sites.
Although it runs
counter to the usual progression of archeological investigations, it
would always be preferable to conduct survey, evaluate sites and make
recommendations after the excavations of a few selected sites. Such a
reverse procedure would be extremely useful when working 1n a
relatively unknown cultural or stratigraphic area.

APPENDIX II
In addition to these sites, the
contractor
wi I I
gather
information to evaluate the complex of sites identified as X41HI78,
81-86 for their el igibi I ity to be nominated as a single complex to the
National Register of Historic Places. If the sites appear eligible, a
Sufficient
nomination form shal I be filled out by the contractor.
information wi I I be gathered to determine the nature of the lithic
processing that took place at these sites. The effort for this site
evaluation and surface collection is estimated at 20 man-days.
Evaluation of another, as yet unnumbered site (identified herein
as "Site A") located in a borrow pit just north of the confluence of
Aqui I la and Hackberry creeks, shal I be conducted by the contractor.
This evaluation shal I determine the size, depth, boundaries and
occupations present and determine the significance for possible
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. Estimated
effort for this evaluation is 10 man-days.
Borrow Area G shal I be intensively surveyed to determine the
existence of any archeological or historical sites. This borrow area
(approximately 1/8 square mi le in area) has been excluded from
previous surveys but is reported to contain Paleoindian material.
Estimated effort is 2 man-days.
The field work is expected to take approximately three (3) months
and the analysis and report writing an additional nine (9) months.
Excavations and surface collections are expected to be conducted with
careful, consistent archeological control and with uniform recording
procedures. Al I activities shal I be conducted in accordance with the
design set forth in the Plan of Action.
Analysis of collected
material should be conducted concurrently with the field work so that
statistical evaluations can be made in the progress of the work. Work
shal I be terminated at a site if an analysis of the data indicates
information recovery has reached a point of diminishing returns,
defined as a point at which new information can be obtained only on
the completion of considerable additional work. It is anticipated
that professional expertise wi I I be employed in conjunction with the
statistical
evaluation
in determining the completeness of the
information.
Al I excavated areas shal I be backfi I led
by
the
contractor.
As part of the investigations in the project area, an analysis
shal I be conducted to determine the potential food value for the
various avai I able plant species. This part of the study (which may
use data now being gathered by the Corps) wi I I be designed to augment
the resource analysis in the 1979 report "Aqui I la Lake Evaluation".
The study shal I be developed into a catchment analysis to help
determine use and seasonality of the various sites.

II-3

APPENDIX II
Consideration should be given by the contractor to the use of
innovative methods and techniques to increase the recovery and
analysis of information from the sites. Difficulties that wi I I need
solution include developing methods for obtaining as many data as
possible from sites that have been def lated and plowed, resulting in
m1x1ng of levels and a blurring of activity areas. The relatively
poor qua I ity of Aqui I la sites must be overcome through efforts to
increase the amount of information recovery. In particular, recently
developed techniques such as thermoluminescence dating, climatic
studies through phytol ith recovery, chemical analyses of soi Is,
detai ~ed I ithic technology studies, trace element
analysis
of
suspected trade items, fauna! analysis to recover age/sex hunting
patterns, and other such methods should be integrated into
a
comprehensive theoretical scheme.
c. Historic archeology. Evaluation wi I I be accomplished by a
historical archeologist on site X41HI173, the three old bridges across
Aqui I la Creek, and also on known farmsteads within the project area to
evaluate their historic potential for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places. A variety of sources, both oral and
archival, wi I I be used to evaluate the importance of the sites. The
results of this investigation wi I I be reported in a section describing
the post-contact history of the region and how the resources within
the project area fit into this history.
3.

Reports.

The contractor wi I I provide reports according to the schedule
given in Section 4.
These reports shal I include a plan of action,
monthly progress reports and a final report.
a. Plan of Action. Two copies of a plan of action specifying
the theory and method to be used in accomplishing the tasks specified
by this scope of work wi I I be submitted by the contractor before
proceeding with the field work. This plan of action shal I be used to
guide the field work after incorporation of any rev1s1ons
or
clarifications requested by the Corps. Detai Is shal I be described on
the procedures by which field work wi I I be conducted to gather and
analyze data applicable to problem specific solutions.
Special
attention shal I be given to difficulties with the data base ar1s1ng
from deflation and plowing and methods whereby these limitations may
be overcome. Attention should be given to the inclusion of previously
gathered data in the final report which should be an integration and
summary of al I work in the Aqui I la area. The plan of action should be
flexible enough to al low the incorporation of additional material if
it becomes avai Iable. The plan of action should also include a
statement concerning how qua I ity control and schedules are to be

maintained and how the diminishing returns analysis will be conducted.
II-4

APPENDIX II

The problems to be considered in the plan of action shal I be
drawn from, but not necessarily I imited to, the fol lowing I ist. If a
problem appears solvable only with extreme expenditures of time and
money, consideration should be given to collecting (but not analyzing)
data pertinent to its future solution. Although this set of problems
is not I ikely to be entirely or even partially solved with the Aqui I la
data, consideration of the potential for gaining relevant information
is essential to the advancement of our understanding of the cultural
resources of Central Texas.
Problems:
1.

To provide information and initial formulations
an understanding of past human experience.

2.

To identify changes 1n settlement pattern, technology, and
resource procurement activities over time, including such topics
as site use, seasonality, location, density, distribution, and
diversity.

3.

To gain better chronological control over the archeological
record, especially in such areas as the use of debitage and tools
other than projectile points to identify cultural periods.
The
identification of I ithic reduction sequences for each period is a
related problem.

4.

To identify and if possible quantify environmental changes
associated with each biotic zone at different periods in the past
and to develop resource density/distribution outlines applicable
to a catchment analysis.

5.

The development and testing of explicit mathematical models for
predictions from resource distributions and diversity of site
location, size, and function as wel I as artifact density and
diversity.

6.

To gain and evaluate data concerning the causes that are
responsible for the failure to adopt agriculture in Central
Texas, especially since agricultural techniques were known from
nearby areas.

7.

To identify trade systems and other ties with the Caddoan area,
the Central Brazos drainage, and possibly with the Edwards
Plateau and other surrounding regions. Acquisition of knowledge
about specific material sources and of trade mechanics is an

integral part of this problem.

of current work shal I be given, including the percent
compl~ted
for each site during both the field work phase and the
artifact analysis. The progress for each section of the report and of
special analyses wi I I also be described.
c. Final Report. One hundred copies of the final report on the
archeological work in the Aqui I la Lake area shal I be submitted to the
Contracting Officer within the schedule detailed in Section 4.
The
report shal I include the method, theory, analysis, and results of the
work accomplished to date in the reservoir area.
The goal of the
excavation and analysis shal I be an integration of the knowledge to
date about the Aqui I la project area and surrounding region, specifying
the
relationships
of
ancient and modern man to the Aquil la

APPENDIX Ill

ANALYSIS OF 1982 MOLLUSCAN FAUNA

Raymond Neck
The terrestrial environment surrounding Aqui I la Lake,
Hi II
County, Texas, is characterized by local variation due to the varied
geological substrates. Blackland Prairie and Eastern Cross Timbers
biotic zones occur along the margins of the lake; a short distance to
the east is the oak-hickory woodland. To the west, the Lampasas Cut
Plains
are a complex mosaic of scrub woodlands and pra1r1es.
Terrestrial gastropods react to the mosaic of substrate and vegetation
such that the environment of a point in time and space can be
reconstructed from an analysis of the molluscan fauna.
The aquatic environment also varies along this geographical
transect,
although changes are more gradual and often subtle.
However, Aqui I la Lake occurs 1n the transition zone between the
Coastal Plain to the east and the more upland piedmont zone to the
west. Freshwater mussels and, to a lesser extent, snai Is also reflect
these
habitat
differences,
al lowing similar opportunities for
environmental reconstruction.
Al I molluscan samples reported herein were received sorted and in
labeled bags.
I wish to thank the anonymous (to me) workers who
performed this arduous task. Al I samples of snai Is were from material
which was retained by 1/4 inch screen. Such methods al low a multitude
of smaller individuals to pass into the backdirt pi le, forever lost to
meaningful interpretation. Absence of these smaller specimens reduces
the diversity of the recovered fauna and precludes detailed analysis
of the habitats present in the surrounding environment. However, some
significant local habitat reconstruction can be accomplished from the
avai Iable samples.

These name changes reflect current thinking by taxonomic workers,

Molluscan she I Is were avai Iable from two
sites:
41HI105
(McDonald Site) and 41HI115 (McKenzie Site). Analysis of these two
sites wi I I be made in sequence.
Fol lowing these two sections, a
summary of the significance of the recovered molluscan samples wi I I be
provided.
41HI105 - MCDONALD SITE
The McDonald Site occurs on modern alluvial deposits of Hackberry
Creek above its confluence with Aqui I la Creek. Molluscan samples from
the site included terrestrial snai Is as wel I as freshwater snai Is and
bivalves from a column of 35 levels which included a major midden
deposit. In addition, freshwater mussels from a single surface
(Surface II) were collected in a grid pattern. Figures III.l and
III.2 i I lustrate the distribution of molluscan remains across this
occupation surface.
Large amounts of snai Is and clam she I I were present in the column
taken from this site (tables III.1 - III.3). Snai Is were recovered
from al I layers; clams were present in al I but the top five levels.
Clam shel Is from the lowest level (35) appear to be water worn,
which indicates deposition of flood debris. Above this level, the
lower levels of this column were vastly dominated by Amblema pl icata
with moderate amounts of Lampsi I is hydiana. Minor amounts of Quadrula
~etrina, Cyrtonaias tampiconensis, Lampsi lis teres, Quadrula ~and
otami lus
purpuratus
were
also
present.
Greater numbers of
individuals and species are present in levels 6 through 14.
Clam
shel I weight peaks in levels 8 to 11, which coincides with a peak in
amount of debitage (David Brown, personal communication). Above this
peak, clam she I I weight declines rapidly.

Snai I shel I weight is generally low in the lower levels, except
for a large total in level 27. Snai I weight also peaks in levels 8 to
12, but snai I shel I occurs in al I of the uppermost levels, in contrast
to the absence of clam she I I at the top of the column.
Analysis of the snai I species present indicates an early (lower
levels) occurrence of exposed or prairie environments (dominance of
Rabdotus mooreanus) with some woodland present (presence of Mesodon
roemeri), possibly marginal to the site.
Upper levels (1 - 11)
indicate a better developed woodland, possibly including trees at the
site itself. Existence of these woodlands is indicated by the present
surface.
Clam species present indicate a moderate size stream with
calcareous waters. Substrate was soft (sand and/or mud) as opposed to
rocky. Water current velocities were sufficient to result 1n rather
clear water.
Several trends in the data indicate the occurrence of only
marginal food supplies (for humans) at this site as wel I as the
possibi I ity of food resource depletion.
Several strikingly small
valves are present in the midden deposit. One Quadrula apiculata is
less than 30 mi I I imeters in length, while one she I I of~ pl icata, at
90 mi I I imeters length, i I lustrated the presence of a few very large
specimens. Either food was scarce or al I she I Is encountered were
retained.

The McKenzie Site is in the cut bank of a gully off the main
branch of Hackberry Creek in the upper part of the western arm of
Aqui I la Lake. The site is buried about 280 centimeters below the
modern surface of an alluvial terrace. Shel Is of freshwater mussels
and terrestrial snai Is comprise most of the culturally modified or
uti I ized material as I ittle I ithic debitage was recovered.
Molluscan material was collected from a trench dug along the side

mooreanus. This species 1s indicative of pra1r1e conditions.
No
suggestion of woodland is given by the snai Is recovered. Numbers of
R. mooreanus are greatest in the upper levels of this trench, at and
above the level of the peak number of clam shel Is.

III-11

APPENDIX III
A very large number of clam shel Is were recovered from the mapped
midden level (Figure III.3 and Table III.6). Of a total of 770 clam
valves, 613 (79.6~) were Amblema pl icata. This species, along with
four
others
(Lampsi I is h diana, Potami lus purpuratus, guadrula
apiculata and Lampsi I is teres form 99.0% of the total number of clam
valves.
Significant rare species were Megalonaias gigantea, which is
usually found in 8 to 15 feet of water, and Anodonta grand is, which is
rarely found 1n archeological sites, at least partly due to fragile
valves.
This area was probably an impacted area in or along the edge of a
prairie with few large snai I species. The clam and snai I fauna are
both of less diversity than samples recovered from the McDonald Site.
Cultural evidence does not indicate whether the clams in this shel I
midden were deposited over a matter of days or years. The paucity of
snai Is
in the midden may indicate that the clam shel Is were
accumulated very rapidly, al lowing for I ittle development of snai I
populations.
DISCUSSION
Both of the above sites contain large clam middens that contain
many (41HI105B) or a few (41HI115) shel Is of Rabdotus mooreanus. Much
debate has centered on the origin of these Rabdotus she I Is in various
archeological sites in Central and South Texas. Possible origins
which have been hypothesized include the fol lowing:
1) Rabdotus
she I Is indicate a food source for Amerindian populations in this
geographical area; 2) Rabdotus populations develop in midden remains
which contain organic and shel I debris; 3) "natural" occurrence of
Rabdotus shel Is due to acts of predators or normal death processes;
and 4) use of shel Is for ornamental or ceremonial purposes. Review of
the I iterature and analysis of several sites by this author has
convinced me that the origin of Rabdotus shel Is in archeological sites
can be due to any of the above processes.
At the two sites examined tn this study, the or1g1n of the
Rabdotus she I Is appears to be due to reproductive populations that
developed in fresh midden material. Clam shel I provides a source of
calcium for the she I I of the snai I while remnant clam meat and other
organic remains provided sustenance for the I iving snai Is.
Selection of method 2 for these two sites is due to a pattern of
peak Rabdotus occurrence at and above levels of peak clam she I I
occurrence. A number of Rabdotus not of adult size but large enough
to be retained by 1/4 inch mesh screen indicate that some immature
Rabdotus were present. Interestingly, those layers that contain the
woodland snai I, Mesodon roemeri, contain very few immature specimens

Only a smal I portion of the clam shel Is showed evidence of
burning.
Undoubtedly, the burned portion was originally larger than
that revealed in these samples.
Burned she I I disintegrates much
faster than non-burned she I I.
An assumption can be made that the
people who left behind this midden debris either ate most of the clams
raw, cooked them without charring the shel I, or cooked them fol lowing
removal of the meat from the shel I. Most of the clams were broken at
the posterior, a characteristic of human opened shel Is. A few large
she I Is showed no evidence of breakage, but unbroken she I Is tended to
be smal I valves.
The recovered freshwater mussel fauna is much more diverse than
the present day fauna (see Ful I ington 1979). Reasons for the paucity
of the modern fauna may be partially due to human impact (increased
sediment load due to farming activities), but change in runoff
patterns due to climatic variations may also be significant. The clam
fauna from these archeological sites indicates a larger amount of
water in Hackberry Creek than existed at the time of impoundment of
Aqui I la Lake. Determination of the relative roles of climatic change
and human impact is not possible at this time.

A REVIEW OF ARCHEOLOGY AT AQUILLA LAKE:
1978-1982 INVESTIGATIONS
by E. Mott Davis
Professor of Anthropology
The University of Texas at Austin

The report is systematic and wel I organized; it is so presented
as to permit researchers to extract information from it as needed. It
has the problem of multiple authorship, making for some difficulties
of continuity.
Mr. Brown has dealt with this difficulty wel I in his
final chapters, in Section VI. As in my earlier review of March 1984,
I sti I I feel that the nature of the contributions of the several
authors needs to be more clearly specified. Where a chapter has more
than one author, the extent and nature of the contributions of each
author should be made exp I icit; and where a chapter has one author
but the editor has made additions or modifications, that should be
made clear in the introductory paragraph.
The clustering of the site reports by site category is a strong
point, as is the inclusion of an Introduction and Summary for each
site section.
Specifics:
The Table of Contents at the beginning of Volume I
for the entire report, not just for Volume I.

Chapter 42, Data Analysis, is an important part of the report. I
find the analysis val id, but improvements could be made in the
presentation. Brown>s demonstration of the effects of the differences
in the SMU and TAS definitions of primary flakes is very wel I taken.
His conclusions are discouraging and it is important that his
recommendations (p. 42-27) be emphasized so that directions for future
work can be seen. (I am not sure where the conclusions to this
chapter begin;
possibly on page 42-25, but perhaps on 42-26 or
42-27.) This points up the need for the chapter to be broken into
sections with headings and (if necessary) sub-headings, and with a
summary at the end of each section saying, in effect, "Here 1s where
we are so far".

IV-1

APPENDIX IV
Chapter 43, the catchment analysis evaluation, is a valuable
contribution, but would be much strengthened by the addition of a
paragraph before the present final paragraph, abstracting what has
been accomplished.
I also note that the final sentence ends the
chapter on a decidely downbeat tone which leads use nowhere;
the
implication (unintentional, I am sure) is that we may as wel I give up.
Chapter 44, Culture History, is fine but
needs
frequent
summar1z1ng statements, especially at the end of each section. They
should say, in effect, "Here, then, is where we are at this point."
Without such statements it is hard to fol low the thread.
Chapter 45, Regional Research Design, is wel I done. Ideally this
should be consolidated with Chapters 46 and 48, but the task would be
enormous and the present arrangement is satisfactory.
Chapter 46, Research Directions, is an extremely thoughtful and
valuable chapter, but I feel that each question should be fol lowed by
about two sentences saying what kinds of evidence, or what kinds of
investigations, are needed to test, explore, or answer the questions.
Such statements would provide the research directions of the title of
the
chapter.
Without
such statements the presentation feels
incomplete. They would show that the questions are testable and thus
scientifically val id.
Chapter 47, Historical Research Design, is excel lent, a model of
its kinds, presenting hypotheses and stating how they may be tested.
We need more statements of this kind in archaeology.
Chapter 48, Research Goals: A Final Summary; a 54-page chapter
can't be cal led a summary! This is a review and discussion. It 1s
appropriate and very wel I done.
But it desperately
needs
a
summarizing statement at the end of each section.
A commendable feature of the Aqui I la project was the resurvey
reported 1n Appendix I, in which an effort was made to locate again
al I the sites recorded during al I the work at Aqui I la, in order to see
what changes might be occurring and to appraise the qua I ity of the
documentation. Brown's observations on the lessons learned from this
work (pp.
3-4 of Appendix I) are extremely valuable and merit more
prominence in the report.
Speaking generally, the Aqui I la Project has produced a large body
of detailed information, and the analyses performed can serve as
models for similar analyses in the future. A previously unknown area
is now covered archeological ly. The data are given in enough detai I
so that they can be uti I ized profitably in subsequent research.
The
integration of the results with existing information has resulted in
IV-2

APPENDIX IV
the refinement of a number of regional research questions, and this
wi I I have a salutary effect on later research in the region. As I see
it, these are the major contributions of the project.
It is disappointing, of course, that the research at Aqui I la has
not
succeeded in fi I ling any important existing data gaps 1n
information, nor has it caused any significant revision of former
views.
It may be asked, then, whether this lack of major results
reflects a dearth of information in the sites investigated, or flaws
in research strategy. It appears to me that the former circumstance
is partly to blame, but that there have been strategic weaknesses as
wel I.
This project has shown that the Aqui I la area does not have may
sites with abundant information on I ifeways, culture history, or
processes of change;
but since a few such sites do exist, it seems
that a greater proportion of the time might have been spent on them.
I feel that more f lexibi I ity should have been written into the Scope
of Work (the first one in Appendix II, in which specific sites and
alternates are spelled out on the basis of the earlier work by SMU) in
order more readily to permit alterations of strategy on the basis of
new information in the sites or new perceptions by the archeologists.
I also concur with Brown's comments to the effect that intensive
testing, and even excavation, early in the survey phase of the Aqui I la
work (before the involvement of the Texas Archeological Survey) could
wel I have resulted in a better job of indicating which sites would be
most productive information.
In addition, the work of Dr.
Patton, the geomorphologist,
reported in Chapter 3, should have been much more closely integrated
with the archeological activities throughout the Aqui I la work, rather
than being a separate unit (Brown acknowledges this on pp. 3-4 of
Appendix I). Interdisciplinary research is not productive if the
disciplines involved are not brought together to answer common
questions. It was not enough to have Patton work out a terrace
sequence, which later enabled Watson to look at site distribution in
terms of the sequence; indeed, in one place Watson poses an important
question about the nature of the formation of the Terrace-1 fi I I,
which could not be answered because the geologist had not been aware
of the need for such an answer when he was part of the project. The
archeologists needed to have Patton in the field periodically during
the excavation phase of the work, as wel I as during the earlier SMU
survey, asking relevant questions about the environment and suggesting
ways to pursue the answers. He should also have been available for
consultation during preparation of the report, so that he might have
collaborated with Brown in the geomorphological aspects of the
chapters introducing the site report sections, especially Chapters 29
and 36 and Watson,s Chapter 41.

IV-3

APPENDIX IV
Summary. This report makes accessible to researchers a great
volume of data on an area hitherto I ittle known archeological ly. The
report would benefit from more headings and summary statements within
chapters to improve the clarity of the discussion. The analyses and
discussions in the final chapters are wel I taken and insightful, and
make the most of a tremendous volume of data gathered under varied
circumstances. The lack of important new information derives in part
from the nature of may of the sites investigated; but a more flexible
research strategy written into the contractual agreements might have
permitted the exploitation of more situations where good information
appears to have been avai Iable. Also, closer integration of geologic
research with the archeological work, beginning with the earliest
phase of survey work by Southern Methodist University and continuing
through the work of the Texas Archeological Survey, might wel I have
resulted in a better allotment of work among sites and the production
of significant additional information.

COMMENTS:
1.

Overall, the report contains useful data and discussions.

2. While variable in presentation, Chapters 4 and 44 through 48 are particularly interesting. Chapters 44, 46, and 48 provide provocative discussions
from a regional perspective.
3. Some chapters, illustrated by Chapter 29, seem poorly organized and do
not flow smoothly. Additional editing would make the report easier to read.
4. Throughout the report, artifact groupings are treated so conservatively
as to be annoyingly indecisive. This reflects a lack of skills in sorting
basic units of archeological study -- the artifacts. Greater confidence in
identification and description will produce more meaningful interpretations
and theoretical discussions.

5. As is illustrated by Chapter 30, Â·the statistical manipulation of the
data is forced. Such use of statistics seems to be inappropriate, particularly on small samples of artifacts.
6. Throughout the report, Skinner (1981) and Weir (1975) are cited for population density estimates; I suggest their interpretations not be used
uncritically.
7. The greatest failing of this report should not be blamed on the principal
author, but upon the original investigators who wasted several seasons of
work on this project. Specifically, the environmental/functional site typology
employed by SMU failed miserably in providing explanations of the cultural
expressions extant at Aquilla Lake. Archeologists cannot agree on artifact
typology, much less an environmental/functional site typology. The investigative emphasis must be directed toward an inventory of the events that
occurred in specific localities first, the:these can be placed into an interpretive framework. Mr. Brown has done an admirable job in trying to "salvage"
the archeology of Aquilla Lake; I do not envy him the difficult situation into
which he was placed.
