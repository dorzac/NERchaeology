MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The City of El Paso began construction of the new Museum of History, the new wing of
the main public library, and a recreational park in down town El Paso in 2004. In 1861,
Simeon Hart, a staunch confederate in El Paso, donated land on which the buildings now
stand, for burial of confederate soldiers killed in battle. Thus, the site first became a
cemetery in 1861 and subsequently remained a United States military cemetery reserve
until 1885. President Glover Cleveland granted the land parcel to the City of El Paso by
proclamation in 1893. Although the project is known as the Cleveland Re-development
Project, it covers both Buckler Square and Cleveland Square in downtown El Paso.

Before construction started in April 2004, the Anthropology Research Center at the
University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) conducted a pre-construction assessment of
potential archeological, historical and cultural resources of the project site. The
assessment entailed monitoring geotechnical borings in 2002, followed by a ground
penetrating radar (GPR) survey (2003-2004) to detect presence of graves and test
excavation of a sample of the anomalous loci (2004). Test excavation yielded a few tiny
bone fragments first thought to be human but on :further analysis found to be
indeterminate. However in January, 2004 a backhoe test trench in one of the anomalous
areas detected by the ground penetrating radar encountered a human radius and
innominate bone. A report on the results of the monitoring of the geotechnical borings
was submitted to the City of El Paso in 2004 (Mbutu and Percell 2004). Also, a report on
the ground penetrating survey and test excavation was submitted to the City in 2004
(Mbutu and Dena 2004).

When heavy machinery began digging, trenching, and moving dirt on the construction
site in April 2004, archeologists began monitoring, in tandem, for any archeological
remains being uncovered. Over the duration of the project, additional seven "sets" of
discrete human skeletal remains were recovered in different locations over most of the
construction site. Five of the eight "sets" contain only one bone element each but each
"set" is discussed separately because it is a discrete find in cemetery context, and most

1

likely represents an individual corpse exhumed. It is conceivable, therefore that the
collection of the human remains represents eight different individuals.

Five of the "sets" were recovered between January and November 2004 and these human
skeletal remains were discussed in a preliminary report submitted to the city of El Paso
(Mbutu and Perez 2004) in December 2004. Three additional "sets" of human skeletons
remains were collected between 2005 and May 2006. A report specifically on the human
skeletal remains was submitted to the City and to the Texas Historical Commission in
2007 (Mbutu, Perez, and Alvarez 2007). The human remains have been transferred to the
City of El Paso and are stored at the This El Paso Museum of Archaeology awaiting to be
properly buried at Concordia Cemetery. This is the final comprehensive report updating
the earlier four interim reports.

The report included historic artifacts collected from the construction site. Over 4,500
artifacts were collected. The majority is glass bottle fragments and Euro- American
ceramics. Metal artifacts are less common. The artifacts have been delivered to the City
of El Paso. They will eventually be housed in the new El Paso Museum of History
coincidentally built on the grounds from which the artifacts were recovered.

This research was funded by the City through ENCON International, Inc. The
investigations were conducted under the authority of Texas Antiquities Committee
number permit #2837 and according to standards of the Council of Texas Archeologists.
This report satisfies the provisions of the National Historic Preservations Act of 1966, as
amended through 1992 and the Texas Antiquities Code for Phase I archeological and
historical resources investigations.

l.O INTRODUCTION

The City of El Paso plans to re-develop Cleveland Square downtown. Although the
general term of reference for the project is Cleveland Square, the project covers both
Carnegie Square (also shown on some historical maps as Buckler or Buckley Square) on
the 100 block and Cleveland Square on the 200block of west Franklin, respectively.

Both Carnegie Square and Cleveland Square comprised a United States military cemetery
from 1861 to ca. 1885 when the cemetery was abandoned and bodies moved to other
cemeteries in the country (Figure 1.1). Planned projects include construction of a History
Museum, expansion of the main Public Library at 501 North Oregon Street, and
establishment of a recreational park. The construction and landscaping will entail the
demolition of the Golden Age Center, relocation of the historic Mandy, the mule replica
and carriage, relocation of the Heroes Monument, a Civil War commemoration stone
marker, and permanent closure of El Paso Street from Franklin to Missouri. Also, of
concern will be a Geodetic stone monument (BM 3755) standing north of the Golden Age
Center in Cleveland Square.

The goal of Phase 1 of the research was to assess the archeological, historical and cultural
resource potential likely to be impacted adversely by this project; and to make
recommendations on treatment of the resources. This phase involved archival research
on the history of Cleveland Square, a ground penetrating radar survey of the project area,
and test excavation of a sample of the anomalous areas.

The ground penetrating radar survey was conducted by graduate students from the UTEP
Geology Department. Personnel from the Anthropology Research Center at the
University of Texas at El Paso conducted assessment for potential archeological,
historical and cultural resources of the project site. Dr. Stephen Mbutu directed the

research project.

The final archeological monitoring phase lasted from April 2004 until May 2006. Human
remains, artifacts and animal bones were encountered in most of the construction site.
This is the final report of the archeological assessment and monitoring at the Cleveland
Square Re-development site.
The rest of this report contains nine parts and nine appendices. A brief history of
Cleveland Square is presented in Part 2. In Part 3, we present an illustrated report of the
ground penetrating radar survey findings. The test excavation results are discussed in
Part 4. In Part 5 we report on other historical and cultural properties documented on the
Cleveland project site. Conclusions and recommendations based on the testing phase are
summarized in Part 6 of the report. Archeological features and artifacts encountered
during the monitoring phase are discussed in Part 7. Human remains are the subject of
Part 8. Discussion and conclusions are presented in Part 9. Finally, summary and
recommendations are made in Part 10. A list of references cited completes the research
report. The nine appendices contain supplemental information, photographs of artifacts,
and copies of original archival documents, that bolster our understanding of the historic
context of the project area

, 2.0 A BRIEF HISTORY OF CLEVELAND SQUARE
The Carnegie Square and Cleveland Square occupy blocks 100 and 200 of West/Franklin Avenue, respectively. Franklin Avenue was created in 1859 when Anson Mills did the
plat of the town of El Paso. It was named for Benjamin Franklin Coons, a :freighter and
developer, who arrived here at "The Pass" in June 1849. Franklin Coons was the second
owner of the small hamlet that would later become Franklin Town and eventually grow to
be El Paso City.

By 1859, Simeon Hart owned 320 acres of land in the old Northwest section of

downtown El Paso. The property boundaries were the river to the West, Oregon street to
the East and bounded on the south by Main street and on the North by Wyoming street.
Before Hart's death in 1874, he donated present day Cleveland Square and Carnegie
Square to the army for a burial ground, since the property was considered of such small
value at the time. In 1861 the government established a cemetery and it was here that
soldiers of early days were buried with military honors, although no effort was made to
transform the spot into anything but a desert waste. Some military remains, consisting of
Union soldiers only, were transferred to Fort Snelling, Minnesota in 1883. The
remaining bodies at this site were later moved to Concordia Cemetery in El Paso.
In 1894, President Glover Cleveland turned over both plots to the City of El Paso by a

presidential proclamation. In 1885 the Rio Grande river flooded Chihuahuita and some
refugees temporarily settled here. As late as 1891, the army placed a guard on this block
to hold it against other claimants. It is unclear under what circumstances Judge Julius
Buckler became associated with the 100 block which was at one point was called Buckler
Square before it became Carnegie Square around 1904.
By 1906 the block was ready for a park and was named after U.S. President Grover

Cleveland. On May 1, 1908, a commodious band shell (Figure 2.1) was built and in 1909
this was a parade stop for the Taft-Diaz meeting in El Paso (Figure 2.2).

By 1910 several massive open air meetings were held here for religious and political
services. Also many popular municipal concerts were given along with public oratory. In
1914 a large angry crowd gathered here to denounce the murder of William S. Benton, a
British rancher, who was killed in Juarez by Rodolfo Fierro, Pancho Villa's most loyal
executioner.

In May of 1936, the city of El Paso built a recreational center chiefly for adults and

named it the Hugo Meyer Recreation Center at Cleveland Square. On clear days an
estimated 200 El Pasoans were at the park daily playing chess, checkers, horse shoes,
badminton, roque, croquet, ring tennis and other similar games. By 1950 it was known as
the Cleveland Square Center and 100 to 125 persons would fill the game room daily
where Mrs. Marie Michael was the supervisor in charge. On June 19, 1958, a newer
recreation center for elderly citizens was completed. In 1969 the 2,100-pound replica of
Mandy the Mule was moved from San Jacinto Plaza to Cleveland Square. In 1972 the
Golden Age Center opened here and it is thought to be the first senior citizen center in
Texas going back to 1936.
The north side of the 100 block on West Franklin was also owned by Simeon Hart in
1859 and by 1861 it was also part of the government military cemetery. In 1900 it was
called Buckler Square and had a bandstand in the middle of the block. By 1904 the
property was part of the Carnegie Library and later it was called the "Free Public
Library." Today, the North side of the 100 block ofW. Franklin is still a part of the El
Paso Public Library.

3.0 GROUND PENETRATING RADAR SURVEY
By
By Oscar Dena and Enrique Casana

Introduction
According to historical records, there existed in El Paso a military cemetery located in
what is now an area comprising two blocks in downtown El Paso. These two blocks are
now occupied by a branch of the El Paso public library and by Cleveland Square. Bodies
from this cemetery were removed and transported to a different location before
construction of the existing facilities was begun. However, there exists the possibility that
some of the bodies were left behind in the area. In order to determine if in fact bodies still
remain, a geophysical study based on electromagnetic non-inductive wave propagation
was conducted. This technique is more commonly referred to as Ground Penetrating
Radar (GPR), and it has the advantage ofbeing non-invasive and non-destructive.

Methodology

Ground Penetrating Radar is a high resolution technique to image shallow soil and
underground structures using electromagnetic waves in the range of 10 to 1000 MHz.
These waves are sensitive to dielectric properties of the rocks. In this study a 225 and 450
MHz antennas were used in order to find disturbances in the soil at a depth range between

1and3 meters (1 foot and 3 inches to 9feet and 9 inches). Essentially, the goal was to
fmd breaks in the sedimentary pattern that could be correlated to graves.

Velocity Determination

While using GPR, it is of vital importance to determine the velocity model for the
medium of propagation. To achieve this, soil samples were collected from the area, and
analyzed for their properties. According to this mode~ the most suitable velocity for this
study is 15 run/sec which corresponds to dry sandy conditions.

Survey Setup

The area was divided into two main areas, Lot A and Lot B (see figure 1). Taking into
consideration the general width of coffins and the Christian tradition of burial (bodies
aligned East-West); a sensitivity grid was designed aligning most of the lines
perpendicular to burial conditions and with a spacing of three meters between survey

lines.
Tedmical Details

The GPR signal shot interval along the lines was never greater than 0.25 meters to insure
an optimum spatial resolution and a good depth of penetration within the area. Signal
strength was preserved by using a 16 stack coverage.

For processing purposes, an exponential gain filter was applied to all acquired line data
with the intent of preserving the layering in the shallow part of the GPR record and
enhancing late arrivals. In some cases, a deconvolution filter was also applied to
eliminate some of the ringing in the incoming signal traces.

fustmment Response

To check the real response of the instrumentation to soil disturbances caused by graves,
the GPR unit was field tested at Concordia Cemetery. The result of this test showed that
the unit is indeed able to identify said anomalies (see figure 3.3). This test helped
constrain our velocity model and proved our shot interval to be appropriate.

10

Results
LOT A (Buckler Square I Carnegie Square)

A total often survey lines were laid in this lot. Lines marked lA to 6A are all trending
roughly in a SE-NW direction. They are located on the western boundary of the lot,
running parallel to El Paso Street (see Fig. 3.2). The remaining four survey lines, l_pr_A
to 4_pr_A, were laid on the northwest comer of the property. They all trend roughly in a
SW-NE direction, parallel to Missouri Street and perpendicular to the six north trending
survey lines.
Data for lines 1_pr_A to 4_pr_A yielded a systematic set of shallow anomalies (approx. I
m.) running perpendicular to the lines (figures 3.4 to 3.7). These anomalies (marked by
purple circles) are identifiable and seem to be consistent from line to line. These
anomalies are believed to be caused by utility lines running across the property.
Anomalies associated with soil disturbances, were also identified (yellow circles). These
anomalies might be due to soil movements related to graves in the area, however a
careful inspection of the area showed that anomaly A is better correlated to the presence
of a concrete corridor that creates waveform changes due to variation in the speed of
propagation. Anomaly B, on the other hand, is interpreted as soil disturbances associated
to roots, which are clearly identified in lines 3_pr_A and 4_pr_A (figures 3.6 and 3.7)
correlated with the presence of trees visible in figure 3.2.
On the other hand, data from survey lines IA to 6A yielded anomalies in lines IA
(anomalies C and D yellow squares in figure 3.8), 2A (anomalies E and Fin figure 3.9)
and 6A (anomaly G, figure 3.13). In line IA, anomalies C and D appear to correspond to
soil disturbances. However C is found near the concrete corridor found in the vicinity,
which is believed to be the cause of the anomalies, ruling out any other source for said
anomaly. Anomaly D is proposed as a digging target. Hyperbolic shaped anomalies were
identified within survey line 2A (figure 3.9). These anomalies were labeled E and F, and
are related to roots of the two trees over which data were collected. The data for lines 3A

11

to 5Ayielded no other significant anomalies (figures 3.10 to 3.12). Finally, a soil
disturbance is identified in line 6A as anomaly H (figure 3.13); this rupture in the strata
layering is proposed as a digging target.
LOTB.

Data collected from lot ··B"· is the most extensive. The grid was designed in the same way
as in Lot .A.., meaning that the main trending is roughly due north. However, a set of
lines trending NW, was also laid out. No significant anomalies were found within the
lines lain across the parking lot area (figure 3 .14) and none of the lines trending SW-NE
and parallel to the parking lot ones yielded significant targets. However in lines roughly
trending in S-N direction and labeled 1B-8B, several anomalies are identified. The spatial
distribution of anomalies in this area is as follows:
Line lB: No anomalies are identified
Line 2B: Several anomalies are identified along this line; however most of them are

related to cultural noise (electrical utilities) and roots rather than to grave related patterns.
Nevertheless, a significant hyperbola shape struci.ure (anomaly H) appears to the southern
section of this line. This anomaly is possibly related to graves in the area and is proposed
as a digging target, thus is flagged as shown in figure 3 .15.
Line 3B: Two grave related anomalies are proposed as targets along this line (labels I and
J, figure 3.16) because of the soil disruption pattern. The other hyperbolic shaped

anomalies along this profile are interpreted as pipes and thus disregarded.
Line 4B: A significant anomaly proposed as a digging target is identified in this profile.
The rest of anomalies are mainly associated to cultural noise (Figure 3.17)
Line 5B: No anomalies are identified except those related to cultural noise.

12

Line 6B: No anomalies are identified except those related to cultural noise.
Line 7B: A soil disturbance topped by a somehow hyperbolic shaped structure is
proposed as a digging target (anomaly Lin figure 3 .18). A deconvolution filter was
applied to this line to suppress ringing and enhance the image.
Line 8B: A soil disturbance is located due north at the end of this profile, the anomaly
could be caused by the vicinity of a concrete hallway and is labeled as anomaly "M".
However, we recommend monitoring the area during excavations.

'to TEST EXCAVATIONS
The ground penetrating radar survey detected several anomalies throughout the project
site (Figure 4. I). Five out of the seven anomalies ranked as strong were subjected to
subsurface testing. A lxl meter unit was excavated by hand over each anomaly (Total=

5 units) to depths ranging from 1.5 to 2.0< meters.

Test Unnnt 1 (Anomaly I)
A 1-meter square test unit was excavated at the location of anomaly (I) to a depth of 180
cm below surface. The excavation progressed at 20 cm increments. At the top of the soil
strata was modem fill (Table 4.2; Figure 4.2). Underlying the modem fill was a silty
loam mixed with gravels and pebbles. A calcareous clay lens was encountered at the base
of the test unit.

Artifacts recovered from Test Unit 1 included bottle grass, ceramic sewer pipe fragments
and wire nail (Figure 4.3). Five bone pieces and one tooth were recovered from this unit.
The tooth and three bone :fragments belong to animal species but the remaining two bones
are indeterminate. No artifacts were recovered below I 00 cm below surface.

Test Excavation Uimit 2 (Anomaly H}
A one meter square unit was excavated at the location of anomaly (H). The top most
layer consisted of modem fill and grassroots overlying a very dark grayish brown sandy
loam. The second stratum was characterized by a very gravelly brownish yellow sand on
the east wall. A light yellowish brown fine sandy silt loam was encountered along the
south wall where it overlies a yellowish brown clay lens with gypsum inclusions. The
third stratum along the eastern wall consists of a very pale brown sand. The layer is
truncated by a shaft (Figure 4.4; Figure 4.5) that may once have contained a coffin. The
shaft extends into the bottom layer of the test unit. The bottom stratum consisted of very
pale brown laminated sands with mineral deposits.
Two conjoinable human rib bone fragments were recovered from this test unit at 20~40
cm below surface (Figure 4.6). Each fragment has an average thickness of 7 mm.Artifacts
from Test Unit 2 include a gaming glass marble, bottle glass fragments, two shell buttons,
and rusted metal pieces (Figure 4.6).

Test Excavation Unit 3 (Anomaly K)

Test Unit 3 was excavated to test anomaly (K). The one meter square unit was excavated
to a maximum of 160 cm below surface. The unit consisted of mostly historical fill and
no discernible natural strata. The top 30 cm of the fill was dominated by a dark grayish
brown clay loam. The remainder of the fill was characterized by a pale brown mixture of
sandy loam, moderate gravels, pebbles, and a few cobbles (Figure 4.7).
Artifact assemblage from this test unit includes white earthenware fragments, a gaming

glass marble, a copper short gun shell, bottle grass :fragments, two pennies, and a brick
fragment (Figure 4.8). Artifacts were encountered intermittently throughout the
stratigraphic levels (Table 4.4).

Test Excavatlion Unit 6 (Allllomaly G)
Test Unit 6 is a one square excavation placed over anomaly (G). Excavation was
terminated at 200 cm below surface. The top layer consisted of extremely compacted
modern fill consisting of sandy clay loam mixed with gravel (Figure 4.9). Gravel density
increased in the second layer. The third layer consisted of pale brown sand with no
evidence of lamination. It lay on top of a pinkish gray caliche lens. The caliche lens
overlaid a layer oflaminated sand. This layer is bioturbated by roots and burrowing
animals; most likely rodents. A clay loam layer with caliche inclusions was encountered
at the bottom of the excavation unit. The only artifact recovered from this unit was a
window grass fragment :from the top 20 centimeters of the excavation (Table 4.5).

Test Excavation Unit 7 (Anomaly D)
A one meter square unit was place over anomaly (D). The top layer was extensively
disturbed by previous landscaping activities. Below the disturbed layer was a modem fill

consisting of yellowish brown sandy loam (Figure 4.10). It overlaid an extremely
gravely pebble laden sandy sediments. The remainder of the unit was dominated by a
thick layer of light to very pale brown sandy loam with gravel inclusions. The bottom
layer consisted of extremely gravelly sandy loam. Excavation was terminated at 160 cm
below surface.

A vertically planted wooden post made of milled wood was uncovered from 40-84 cm
below surface (Figure 4.11; Figure 4.12). A :fragment of a human flat bone was
recovered from between 120-140 cm below surface. The wooden post most likely is the
remnant of a cross that once marked a grave. A bone fragment recovered from 20~40 cm
below surface remains indeterminate.

5.0 HISTORICAL Al\1D CULTUR.AL PROPERTIES ON THE
PROJECT SITE
Historical and cultural properties that exist on Cleveland Square and Carnegie Square
today include a Civil War memorial monument, a replica of Mandy the mule and her
passenger coach, a concrete geodetic bench marker monument, the El Paso Public
Library, and the Golden Age Center.

The monument stands behind the Public Library (Figure 5.1). A plaque on it reads: "To
the Memory of Nine Primitive El Paso's Patriotic Heroes; Emmett Mills (19), Freeman
Thomas, M. Champion, Joe Poacher, John Pontel, John Wilson ... who in 1861 were loyal
citizens ofEl Paso, Texas and loyal employees of the Butterfield Overland Mail
Co. These union men fleeing to California by stage were ambushed by Indians led by
Mangus Colorado in New Mexico. All were slain." In 1920, Anson Mills erected the
stone monument in their memory. An historical account of the Mimbres massacre, as it
has oome to be known, is presented in Appendix E.

Mandy the Mule Replica and Historic Coaclhl

A replica of Mandy the mule and the tram coach she pulled are housed in a shed on

Cleveland Square (Figure 5.2). It was moved here from San Jacinto in 1969. A panel on
the side of the coach reads "El Paso's original traction company was formed by two
pioneer El Pasoans in 1882. They were Joseph Magoffin and Zack T. White. This car
was their first piece of equipment. It ran between El Paso and Juarez, Mexico" (Figure
5.3). The second panel reads "This mule car, the first transportation between El Paso and
Juarez, was presented to the historical society September 15, 1955 by Jesse B. Binkley,
it's conductor in 1901, to be placed in San Jacinto Plaza for permanent care."

A US Coast and Geodetic Survey Triangulation Marker was elected on Cleveland Square
in 1932 (Figure 5.4). Inscription on the a panel on the monument shows the elevation of

Cleveland Square to be 3, 754.573 ft above the mean sea level.

El Paso Public Library

The history of the El Paso Public Library goes back to 1894 when Mary Stanton founded
it. It is on record as being the first public library in the State of Texas. Stanton made

available her personal collection of over one thousand volumes to a room in the Sheldon
Block. In 1899 the library moved into Sheldon Hotel. Around 1900, Mayor Joseph

Magoffin set aside one room in the new City Hall on Kansas and San Antonio for the
4,000 volume library.

The Carnegie Library was opened on April 25, 1904 on Buckler Square (see Figure 2.1).
It was made possible by a $37,500 donation from Andrew Carnegie. El Paso's new city

charter set aside no less than 0. 003 7% of the assessed value of all city property for the
support of the public library. In 1951 El Paso citizens voted a bond issue of$975,000 to

build a new library building (Figure 5.6). The new library at 501 North Oregon Street
was dedicated on September 12, 1954. The library will be substantially expanded during
the current Cleveland Redevelopment Project.

Tllne Gcldeim Age Center

Built in 1972, the Golden Age Center building (Figure 5.5) was vacated recently. It is
now slated for demolition to pave the way for the construction of the History Museum

and a public park.

6.0 POST-TESTING PHASE RECOMMENDATIONS
Hmnan Remmiims
Three tiny fragments of possible human bones, two from Test Unit 2 and one from Test
Unit 7, respectively, were recovered during the test excavation. Additional two bone
fragments from Test Unit land Test Unit 7 were indeterminate. The recovery of possible
human bones in subsurface context suggests human remains may still be encountered
during construction in this old United States military cemetery. We recommend that
construction activities be monitored by a professional archeologist. In the event of
inadvertent discovery of such remains, all work should cease in the vicinity of the
discovery until consultation can be arranged with the Texas Historical Commission. If
the discovery consists of human remains, then the El Paso County Medical Examiner as

wen as the Texas Historical Com.~ission should be contacted in order to ascertain
whether the human remains are of historical or forensic nature; or if they are American
Indian remains. If the latter is determined, then provisions of the Native American Grave
and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) should be applied to the protection and treatment of the
remains.

It is perhaps too early to speculate, before actual discovery of a skeleton, if the

Department of the Army would be have any interest in human remains from this old
military (Union and Confederate) cemetery but it is not oui:side the realm of probability.

Otllller Historic Re~ources
In addition to conducting the GPR survey and subsurface testing, various historical
properties were documented on Cleveland Square and Carnegie Square in the project
area. The properties include a monument depicting a Civil War Era massacre, known
locally as "Heroes Monument", a replica of Mandy, the mule and her mule cart, and a
Geodetic Survey stone marker (BM 3755).

60

The Heroes Monument

The miniature obelisk stands behind the library. It is dedicated "To the Memory of Nine
Primitive El Paso's Patriotic Heroes who in 1861 were loyal citizens of El Paso, Texas
and loyal employees of Butterfield Overland Ivfail Co. These union men fleeing to
California by stage were ambushed by Indians led by Mangas Colorados in New
Mexico." All were slain. In 1920 Anson Mills, whose 19 year old brother was among the
dead, erected a stone monument in their memory. The city will have to make the decision
to preserve the monument in its current location by avoidance or to move it to another
location. One of the most frequently suggested destination is the Old City Hall/Aztec
Calendar Park on San Antonio Street, where it would complement the theme of other
monuments that have been accumulating at the location (Gary Williams, personal
communication; E-mail in Appendix F).

Mandy "The Mule" Replica And Her Historic Street Car

Mandy the mule and the tram coach she pulled are currently housed in a shed on
Cleveland Square. "The El Paso traction company was formed by two pioneer El Pasoans
in 1882. They were JosephMagoffrn and Zack T. White. This car was their first piece of
equipment. It ran between El Paso and Juarez. This mule cart was presented to the El
Paso Historical Society on September 15, 1955 by Jesse B. Binkley, its conductor in
1901, to be placed in San Jacinto Plaza for permanent care." Opinions expressed to me,
by interested members of the public, suggest that the Union Plaza Transportation
!\.fuseum would be a suitable home for Mandy. The El Paso County Historicai Society
should be consulted before any action is taken.

Geodetic Marker (BM 3755)

A US Coast and Geodetic Survey Triangulation Marker was elected on Cleveland Square
in 1932. It displays elevation data of the location. The marker should be preserved on
location. Hopefully, the monument can be preserved in its location by avoidance.

61

A clay potsherd was recovered from 2.2 meters (7 feet) below surface behind the main
library, during geotechnical testing by Licon Engineering Company in 2002 (Appendix
A). Presence of the potsherd in subsurface context is indicative of potential presence of
prehistoric or early historic period site or artifacts. This area should be monitored by a
professional archeologist when construction commences. Incidental discovery of similar
artifacts by construction crews should be reported to the archeological monitor without
delay.

62

7.0 ARCHJEOLOGICAL MONITORING RESULTS: FEATURES
AND ARTIFACTS
This section of the report covers archeological monitoring conducted at Cleveland Square
and Buckler Square in downtown El Paso from April 2004 to May 2006. Over 4,500
artifacts were recovered from the project area during archeological monitoring. The
artifacts have been delivered to the City of El Paso and will eventually be housed in the
El Paso Museum of History coincidentally built on the grounds where the artifacts were
recovered.

7.1 CLEVELAND SQUARE (Westerllll Lot)

Historically, the name Cleveland Square has been used to refer to the city block bounded
by Missouri, Santa Fe, Franklin and El Paso streets. The city block was a Civil War era
cemetery from 1861 to the early 1890s. The Square was named in honor of President
Glover Cleveland who granted the property to the City of El Paso by proclamation in
1894. In 1909, President Tuft, accompanied by President Porfirio Diaz ofl\.1exico,
conducted a public rally at the site. It constitutes the western half of the site under
construction. This city block is the new site of the El Paso Museum of History that was
just completed.

Prior to beginning construction, there were two structures and a USGS geodetic stone
marker on this lot. One of the structures was the El Paso Golden Age Center built in
1972. The other structure was the shed housing the historic Mandy the Mule statue
(M.butu et al. 2004). The geodetic marker and the structures were torn down when
construction began on the site in April, 2004. The plaque of the geodic marker was given
to the city for safekeeping. The statue of Mandy was given to the City for restoration
work and eventual display at the Sun Metro Transportation Museum in Union Plaza.

63

Construction related-excavation on this lot reached over two meters below ground
surface. A pet (dog) burial was uncovered in this lot. No other archeological features
were encountered on Cleveland Square.

Artifacts

With the exception of the dog burial described above, no features such as trash pits were
found on Cleveland Square. Pockets of natural gravel were found on the northern half of
the lot. Subsurface deposits have not been subjected to great disturbance because the site
has been mostly a park for most of the twentieth century. However, no prehistoric
artifacts, sites or features were found. A total of 298 historic age artifacts were recovered
from this lot during construction activities. The range of artifacts included, gamming
marble balls associated with the Golden Age Center, glass bottles and :fragments, building
material debris, and Euro-American ceramics (Table 7. I).

Cerami.cs
A total of 107 Euro-American ironstone ware fragments were collected from Cleveland
Square (western lot). There is a marked paucity of porcelain throughout the collection.

Metal fragments

Metal artifacts were encountered in Cleveland Square. The more common artifacts in this
category include corroded fragments of metal pipes and cans; and construction related
objects such as nails. Rarer objects include iron spikes and bullet cartilages. A sample of
four artifacts was kept in the collection.

Hundreds of bricks from two generations of buildings associated with the El Paso Golden
Age Center since 1936 were encountered on the site. No brick artifacts were collected.
Gamming glass marbles

Three gaming marble balls were collected from Cleveland Square. These artifacts were
associated with the Golden Age Center and Cleveland Park recreation activities.
Annmal Bones

A total of324 animal bones and bone fragments were encountered in this lot during
archeological monitoring. They include bones of cattle, pig, goat or sheep, and fowl.
The majority of the disarticulated bones manifested butcher marks. Bones occurred as

65

isolated finds throughout the Cleveland Square construction site. No features such as
trash pits were encountered in this lot.
A pet grave of a relatively large dog was encountered in the central area of Cleveland
Square. The dog was well preserved. It had been purposely buried, most likely illegally,
in the park. Patina on the bones indicated the pet had been buried decades ago.
7.2. BUCKLER SQUARE (Eastern Lot)

The 1902 Sanborn Fire insurance map of City of El Paso identifies the block bounded by
Franklin, El Paso, Missouri and Oregon streets as Buckler (or Buckley) Square. The city
block was part of a Civil War era military cemetery. For reasons not quite clear, the
block was briefly named after Judge Julius Buckler of El Paso in the late 1890s (Sanborn
Map). After the construction of the Carnegie Library on this block in 1904, the block
was referred to as Carnegie Square. This block constitutes the eastern lot of the current
construction project. It is the site of the west wing extension to the main Public Library
501 North Oregon Street.
Prior Existing Stiruncture al!Ild Monunment
The Public Library

The 1904 Carnegie library building was razed in 1954 and replaced with the current
public library building on 501 North Oregon.

Heroes Monument

The Heroes monument, elected in 1920 by Anson Mills was situated on the northeast
quadrant of Buckler Square. Prior to beginning construction-related excavation on the lot,
the monument was relocated to further downtown El Paso at Stanton and San Antonio in
the general vicinity as the Aztec Calendar Park.

Artifacts
A total of 4289 late nineteenth century artifacts were collected from Buckler Square
during archeological monitoring (Table 7.2). The bulk of the artifacts came from the
domestic trash pit described above. The artifact assemblage is dominated by bottle glass
fragments, and fragments of European ceramic objects. Less abundant in the assemblage
are whole glass bottles, window glass fragments and, corroded metal objects and
fragments.

Glass Bottle Artifacts

Twelve whole glass bottles and 2837 fragments were recovered from Buckler Square.
Bottles were classified into six categories based on use.

Glass Bottle Type Categories
1) Alcoholic Beverage Bottles (liquor and beer)

Four whole bottles and several hundred bottle glass fragment were classified as beer or
liquor bottles. A mold line is visible in one complete bottle. The bottles have cork
finishes and range in color from green, amber to light blue (Lockhart and Olszewisk
1993). In El Paso, Bottles in this category date ca. 1880-1910. The use of crown cap
bottles in El Paso began no later than 1900.

2) Soda Bottles

The crown cap replaced all other finishes between 1895-1900. One bottle was embossed
with "JACKSON'S NAP A SODA SPRINGS with NATURAL MINERAL WATER".

3) Pharmaceutical Bottle

69

One whole pharmaceutical bottle and neck fragments were recovered from the trash pit in
Buckler Square.

4) Culinary Containers

Fragments of wide mouth glass jars for storing food are included in the assemblage.

5) Toiletry Bottles

One whole bottle, 6 cm in height, recovered from the trash pit could have contained
perfilme.

6) Ink Bottle

One whole ink bottle and fragments were collected. The type of ink bottles in this
assemblage were manufactured by the Sanford Company.

A minimum of fifteen (n=l5) manufacturer trade marks were found on whole bottles and
several glass fragments recovered from Buckler Square.

L :MILW: (C.V.C N2): Manufactured by Chase Valley Glass Co. of Milwauke,
Wisconsin. Bottles bearing similar trade mark were found in trash pit containing
primarily beer bottles in San Elizario dated between 1881 and 1894 (Lockhart and
Olsewski 1995).
2. CMLW: Chase Valley Company in Milwauke, Wisconsin ca. 18880-1907.
3. C&C or CCo: Cunningham & Co.,Pittsburgh, PA ca.1880-1907.
4. DSGCo: De Steiger Glass Co. La Salle JL. Ca. 1883-1937.

5. CV No 1: Milwauke, WI ca. 1880-1881.

70

6. C&Co or CCCo: Carl Conrad & Co. of St. Louis. This logo was used on beer
bottles between 1876 and 1883.

7. LGC: Lindell Glass Company of St. Louis Missouri. Beer bottles embossed with
this logo were manufactured in St. Louis, Missouri from 1876 to 1883. ca. 18751888.
8. DHC: D H Chambers of Pittsburg, Pennsyvania. Similar bottles were found in
trash pit containing primarily beer bottles in San Elizario dated between 1881 and
1894 (Lockhart and Olszewski 1995). The factory closed in 1886.
9. One bottle marked "DHC 3 TH 1875" was recovered from the trash pit in Buckler
Square.

10. 57 MGC 1: This manufacturer mark may represent either Modes Glass Company
of Indiana (ca. 1895-1904) or Missouri Glass Company (ca 1900).
11. A bottle embossed with "WOODLAWN BOTTLING EL PASO, TEX CO." was
recovered. The light green Crown cap finish soda bottle was manufactured
between 1909-1914.
12. Another bottle embossed with "JACKSON'S NAPA SODA SPRINGS with
NATURAL MINERAL WATER'' was recovered. The green cork stop finish
bottle originated :from the site of natural springs in Napa Valley California. The
springs were originally owned by John Henry Woods. Colonel John P. Jackson
took ownersbip in 1872. The bottle is made from clear glass with a sloping-collar
finish.
13. The bottle fragment marked "HUNYADI JANOS SAXLEHNER" was
manufactured by Andreas Saxlehner in Buda-Pesht, Austria ca. 1863-1900. It was
used for storing bitterquelle.
14. Other bottle types represented in the assemblage were manufactured by J & DS
John Duncan and Sons ofNew York, NY ca. 1880-1900.
15. A bottle fragment embossed with "SIEGERT & HIJOS" was recovered from
Buckler Square. Siegert & Hijos Company was founded in 1830 in Venezuela by
Dr. J. G.B. Siegert, a German doctor and ally of Simon Boliva. Dr. Siegert created
a herbal concoction to cure a range of maladies and marketed his product under
the trade mark Angostra Aromatic Bitters. The company plant was later relocated
to Trinidad. By the turn of the twentieth century clients of Angostura Aromatic
Bitters included the King of Prussia, King Alfonso XVID of Spain, and King
George V of England. It is curious to know who here in El Paso was in the league
of these European royalties. The company started direct market campaign in the
United States in 1876. Angostura Aromatic Bitters came in olive green bottles.

71

Ceramics

No prehistoric or any other indigenous pottery was found during the monitoring phase of
the project A total of 1418 fragments

ofEuro~American

potshards were recovered from

Buckler Square (Table 7.2). They include a type described as ironstone ware. There is
marked absence of porcelain or any other Chinese imports in the collection. Several
pieces have trademarks or potter's marks showing where the items were manufactured.
The majority of the ironstone items was imported from Scotland and England with a few
items from Germany. The glass bottle collection has great similarities to that described by
Lockhart from Texas and Oregon (Lockhart, Personal Communication). It, however,
manifests great contrast to one described by Sick from the Kohlberg parking lot and that
described by Staski from the Hotel Cortez Extension in downtown El Paso (Staski 1984).
The latter two collections were dominated by Chinese ceramics.
Over 50 ceramic fragments of the European pottery had manufacturer's or potter's trade
marks. At least eleven different manufacturer trade marks are represented in the ceramic
collection from Buckler Square including the following.

l. J & G Ivfeakin Hanley England

2. Port Dundas Company in Glasgow, Scotland
3. Thomas Furnival and Sons, England
4. Alfred Meakin Tunstall, England

6. Campbellfield Pottery
7. Ersbro, Germany
8. Gurro

9. .. .. well and Bishop

10. Lkinson, England
11. Ck and Co, England

72

The ceramic fragments represent a variety of containers including bottles, plates, saucers,
cups, milk jars and other tableware.

The single most common ceramic container in the collection of Euro-American ceramics
is an ironstone bottle. At least 216 fragments were recovered from the largest of the trash
pits on Buckler Square. The manufacturer trade mark indicates they were made by Port
Dundas Company of Glasgow in Scotland. Today the company commoniy manufactures
ironstone bottles for storing whiskey among other beverages. This collection is indicative
of a very affluent family that created this trash pit.
Indigenous Pottery

One clay potshered was found during geotechnical drilling phase (Appendix A). No other
indigenous artifacts were encountered throughout the duration of the project.
Metal

Metal artifacts were encountered in Buckler Square. Metallic artifacts, including
fragments of metal pipes, wire, bottle caps, bolts, nails, and machinery were found in
corroded condition. The exceptions were two horse iron shoes recovered from Buckler
Square. Square nails, metallic button, and a suspender buckle were recovered in a human
burial area. Sixteen metal artifacts were retained in the sample collected (see Table 7.2).
Bricks

Thousands of brick fragments were observed. They were associated with the Carnegie
Library. The building was elected in 1904 and demolished in 1954. The foundation walls
and basement floor tiles were still intact when site excavation began in 2004.

73

Window Glass

A very thick (2 cm) variety of greenish window glass fragments from the Carnegie
Library building was encountered on Buckler Square. Samples of this type of glass are in

the collection from Buckler Square.

Gamming glass marbles

Five gaming glass marbles were recovered from the Buckler Square. The area behind the
library has been a public park since 1954.

Animal Bones

A total of 980 animal bones were encountered in Buckler Square. Animal bones were
recovered in low densities from all over the site and in greater densities in the trash pit.
Over 46% (n=436) of the bones from Buckler Square were found from the trash pits. The
rest came from the general site area. The bulk of the bones showed butcher marks. The
bones belonged to domestic species including cattle, pigs, goat or sheep as well as fowl.

74

8.0 ARCHEOLOGICAL MOI\1ITORING RESULTS: HUMAN
SKELETON

This section of the report covers human skeletal remains recovered during archeological
testing and monitoring conducted at Cleveland Square and Buckler Square in downtown
El Paso between 2004 and 2006. Although the city's general term of reference for the
project is "Re-development of Cleveland Square", the project covers both Buckler Square

(also historically known as Carnegie Square and Cleveland Square ) comprising the 100

and 200 city blocks of West Franklin Street, respectively.
llum1uu1 Skeletal Remains

A total of seven sets human adults and one toddler were recovered from the entire
construction site. All the human bones recovered from the project were transferred to the
City of El Paso and are currently stored at the El Paso Museum of Archaeology waiting
to be properly reburied (Appendix F).
Because both Buckler Square and Cleveland Square contained a military cemetery from

the Civil War era to 1883, it was conceivable when re-development was being planned
that the probability of encountering human remains during the current redevelopment
project was high. Ground penetrating radar before bulldozing commenced had indicated
potential for human burials. Between August and November 2004, construction workers
unearthed four isolated "sets'' of human skeletal remains in Buckler Square. In this
report, a "set" is defined as containing from one to numerous identifiable human organbone elements encountered in a discrete location on the construction site. Collections, in
"sets", of the skeletal remains from Buckler Square were numbered (#1-4) to facilitate a
systematic inventory and less confusing reporting.

General condition: In August 2004, a human adult skeleton was recovered from over
one meter below ground surface on the northwest quadrant of Buckler Square (see Figure
4.1 - Lot A). The skull was never found (Figure 8.1), notwithstanding great monitoring
effort up till the end of the monitoring project in May 2006. Quantitative and qualitative
analyses of the skeleton were conducted at the Anthropology Research Center in UTEP
and later at the Maxwell Osteology Laboratory at the University of New Mexico in
Albuquerque (Appendix H).
The skeleton, mostly the torso and limbs, was found in an extremely fractured condition
(Figure 8.1). The lower portion of the body was better preserved whereas the ribs were
completely fractured. Furthermore, the skeleton manifested evidence of severe
pathology, especially in the lower limbs (Appendix H). Bone pathology will be discussed
below.
Osteofogical Mea§uremeimts: Even though in general the remains were in very poor
conditions, some complete bones were available for measurement. Below are the
measurements obtained (Table 8.1-8.4). It must, however, be emphasized that because of
the pathologies, some of the measurements, especially those measuring bone width, were
affected.

Sex determination: Based on size, length and, robusticity of the bones, the individual

was most likely a male. Bass (1995) provided a range of measurements for an adult femur
which are helpful in determining the sex of an individual. The measurements are

provided in Table 8.5.

Compared to the ranges provided by Bass (Table 8.5), ail of the measurements of the
femur of the Buckler Square adult skeleton fall within the male range. Although the
bones of the pelvis are fragmentary, some non-metric traits were available for analysis.
The sciatic notch, for example, is relatively narrow, which is usually a human male
characteristic. There is no preauricular sulcus visible. The presence of preauricular sulcus
is generally a human female trait.
Age estimation: Since the cranium was not available for analysis, other osteological

traits were used. The medial ends of ribs are generally used to estimate the age of an
individual. Initially, only one complete medial end of a rib was found for analysis. It
exhibited a deep 'V' shape on its sternal end characteristic of individuals from midthirtieth to mid-fifties (Burns 1998). Burns suggests that at this age in males "The

78

superior and inferior edges have grown to the length of the centers. The V has expanded
into a cup-shaped center (Bums 1998:57)." This trait corresponds to an adult stage 5 (33~
42 years) as determined by Iscan et al. (1985). Further analysis by Dr. Heather Edger of
the Maxwell Osteology Laboratory, University of New Mexico in Albuquerque,
identified more ribs useful in determining the age of the skeleton (Appendix H).

JiJ®nne Patlln\ORil > gy: There is evidence of a severe inflammation in the proximal ends of the
tibiae as well as in the entire surface of both femora. This kind of inflammation was
likely caused by an infection. The infection caused the bone to become heavy and much
more solid than a healthy bone. The surface of the affected bone is very porous with an
unusual formation, as opposed to the smooth surface of a healthy human bone (Figure
8.2). Dr. Edger diagnosed this condition as sclerosing osteomyeletis (Appendix H).

Assoc8a~ed

Artifacts: Bits of wood and square nails from the coffin were recovered from

the fill shrouding the skeletal remains. A cloth covered button was found still resting on
the anterior part of the right pelvic bone. A suspenders buckle was found attached to a
piece of wood from the coffin. Two metal buttons were also found in association with
this skeleton.

79

.Partial skeleton of~ chiild: Disarticulated bones of a human child were collected by the
construction crew from Buckler Square. There is very little contextual information on the
juvenile skeletal parts to provide a sense of when it was buried at Buckler Square. The
bones included a fragment of the mandible exhibiting deciduous dentition (Appendix H).
On first impression it appeared that the first molar was about to erupt, vvhich would

generally indicate an age of approximately five to six years (Bass 1985). Also, it was
evident that the epiphyses had not fused even in the bones where the process sets in early
in child skeletal development. For example, the three bones of the pelvis had not fused.
Further and more invasive analysis by Veronica Alvarez and Dr. Heather Edger revised
interpretation of the age of the child to between two and three years, making it a toddler
(Appendix H).

AdluP.t hllllm<eirfills: An adult humerus was found eroding from disturbed fill on the
northwest quadrant of Buckler Square. This specimen is 31.5 cm in length. Green
coloration on the distal end implies burial in a coffin where the bone came into contact
with material containing copper.

Aduh ullllna: An ulna from an adult was recovered from the northwest quadrant of

Buckler Square near the El Paso and Missouri street intersection. The specimen is 25 cm
in length. The specimen is discolored and light probably due to prolonged exposure.

Although all the elements of human skeletons, described. above, were recovered from the
same general vicinity on the northwest quadrant of Buckler Square it can not be assumed
they are related. Discrete provenience for each "set" of bones implies individual corpses

80

because they were found meters ap<lrt in a cemetery context. Hence they are considered
individuals throughout this report.

Human skeletal remains from Cleveland Square (see Figure 4.1 - Lot B) were numbered
"sets" #5-8 (a continuation from Buckler Square) to make inventory of collections from
the entire project less confusing.

Ad!«if.li iradil!lls and illTlllllOmiiiillmte: In Jammrf 2004, during the testing phase, two skeletal
parts, a complete human adult radius and a fragment of a pelvic bone, of an adult human
were found together in a previously identified ground penetrating radar anomaly (Mbutu
and Dena 2004). The bones were recovered from three feet (one meter) below ground
surface. The well preserved radius is 25 cm in length. Patina on the radius indicates it has
been buried for a considerable amount of time and may go back to the Civil War era. The
innominate bone is a weathered iliac fragment. Between 2005 and 2006, more human
bones were found on Cleveland Square. They are described below.

A«lluilt femur fragmermt: This specimen was encountered in a trench on the north side of
the new El Paso Museum of History near the comer of Santa Fe and Missouri streets. It is
broken on the distal and proximal ends. The remainder of the bone shaft measures 35.6
centimeters.

A<h.dt nmnomnnrnte ffrragmel!llt: A fragment of an adult human innominate was recovered
from a trench in the southeast quadrant of Cleveland Square. The side of the hip bone is
indeterminate. How long the bone had been buried in the ground can not be specified.

81

AdluU

imnomiim~te f ir~ngment

This fragment of adult human innominate was also found

in the southeast quadrant of Cleveland Square but in a separate provenience from "set"
#7. As is the case with the other "sets" of human skeletal remains, this specimen likely
belongs to an individual now buried at either Fort Snelling, Minnesota or Concordia
Cemetery in El Paso.

82

9Jll DJISCUSSION AND CONCJLUSJIONS
As data from the pre-construction archeological assessment of the Cleveland Square Redevelopment Project area predicted (Mbutu and Dena 2004), human skeletal remains
were encountered during the construction phase of the project between January 2004 and

May 2006. The skeletal remains have been the subject of this report.
Notwithstanding the thoroughness of exhuming bodies buried in this cemetery back in
1883, some skeletal materials "fell through the cracks". Bodies of identifiable union
soldiers were taken to Fort Snelling, Minnesota. The remainder of the bodies were
interred in Concordia Cemetery in El Paso. All the human skeletal material recovered
during the current project belong to adults with the exception of one child. Specific
identities of individuals whose skeletal remains were recovered during the current project
were not determined. Adult skeletal remains may be military or civilian. Some of the
remains could well belong to Confederate soldiers because the time of burial, for any of
the remains, was any time between 1861and1883.

Previous construction projects on Buckler Square, including construction of the Carnegie
Library in 1904, and subsequently, the El Paso Public Library in 1954, likely encountered
human skeletal remains. The cranium missing from the skeleton found in Buckler Square
during the current project was likely removed during these previous construction projects.
Similarly, on Cleveland Square, construction for an adult recreation center was first
unde1taken in 1936, then in 1958, and the last one was in 1972 when the El Paso Golden
Age Center was built. These projects may also have encountered buried human bones.

It is possible to determine in general terms, by studying the history of cut or square nails,
when the body of the nearly complete male human skeleton ("Set" #1) was interred in

Budder Square. Square nails from the coffin indicate the burial took place in the 19th
century. Regarding the age of square nails, John VI. Poilock et al. (1997) wrote:
Machine cut nails are perhaps best identified by presence of two parallel and two
converging shank surfaces, ending in a stab point. The firsi machine for cutting

83

nails from iron strips was patented by J. Pierson of New York in 1794. However,
the heads of nails continued to be hand-wrought until 1807, when Jesse Reed of
Boston received a patent for a nail cutting machine. The heads of earlier machine
cut nails therefore resemble those of wrought nails, while later examples have the
characteristic flat head. Cut nails remained the dominant form until they were
surpassed in production by wire nails in the late nineteenth century. Beyond this
time, they were produced in very limited quantities.
Written records indicate the Cemetery was in use between 1861 and 1883. After that date
the City of El Paso decided to move the cemetery from downtown to Concordia for
sanitary reasons.

Clothing items found in association with the nearly complete adult skeleton ("Set" #1)
from Buckler Square, including a fabric covered button and a suspenders wire buckle
imply the owner may have been socially relatively well off and not a pauper. He,
however, had been infected 'vith a very debilitating bone disease at the prime of his life.

It is still inconclusive if this individual was a soldier or a civilian. There were metal
buttons found in association ·with the burial. Military uniforms of that period had metal
buttons. Military status of the rest of the adult skeletal remains unknown.

Presence of child skeletal remains in Buckler Square indicates the cemetery may not have
been exclusively military burial ground or that family members of soldiers were also
buried there. Buckler Square borders the old civilian cemetery on the east side of Oregon
Street across from Buckler Square. The boundary between the two cemeteries probably
became blurred as time went by.

84

10.0 SUMMARY AND R1EC01\!ll\4ENDATIONS
The most complete skeleton is probably of non military affiliation. There is very little
contextual information on the juvenile skeletal parts to provide a sense of when it was
buried at Buckler Square. Military status of the remaining six :individuals, can not be
ruled out without further research. Generally, the El Paso County Medical Examiner
(Coroner) has jurisdiction over dead human bodies whose cause of death is unknown in
the city and county. Whenever there is discovery of a dead body in the city, the County
Medical Ex..aminer is notified. He or she determines if the human remains are forensic or
historical. If they are historical, archeologisls are allowed to study them. This protocol
was followed during this project. Dr. Juan Contin, representing Dr. Corinne Stem, El
Paso County Chief Medical Examiner, certified the nearly complete adult skeleton as
historical and not forensic. At the conclusion of the study, the human skeletal collection
is turned over to the county medical examiner for intemwnt. This, for example, was the
protocol followed regarding the human skeleton unearthed on I\.1.issouri Street in 1998
during «CBD Il Street Rehabilitation Project".

This time, however, City of El Paso made the decision to store the human remains in the
El Paso Ivfoseum of Archaeology until they can be buried properly at Concordia
Cemetery (Appendix F).

ARCHEOJLOGKCAJL MONITORING OF GEOTECH BORINGS
By
SitepHnellll Mlb>ut~u amid Ken] Puirc!!::Rll

On April 15, 16 and 17 of 2002, we monitored the geotechnical coring tests conducted

by Licon Engineering as part of the work planned under the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) archeological permit #2837. Licon Engineering
augured six cores from Buckley Square behind the Main Public Library and six soil
cores from Cleveland Square (Figure 1). Each bore hole was 8 inches in diameter
and ranged in depth from 35 to 60 feet below ground surface (Table A.l-A.12).

Archeological monitoring was conducted in tandem with the auguring activity.
The area around each coring station, was inspected for surface artifacts. The
monitor w..ade a systematic visual inspection of the soil from each sampling bore
hole for any indication of cultural artifacts or significant organic matter in the soil.
Soil color (based on the Munsell Soil Color Charts) for every 5-feet incremental

stratum was recorded.

Resnlllts

Occasional modern glass artifacts were observed on the surface in the area of Buckley

Square behind the present EI Paso Public Library. In sampling Bore Hole #4 (Figure
A.1; Table A4), one indigenous brownware potsherd was recovered from 2.2 meters (7
feet) below the ground surface in undisturbed sandy day soil stratum. The artifact was
collected. No other soil sampling bore holes yielded artifacts or other archeological
deposits.

The presence of a potsherd, from pottery by indigenous people, in undisturbed sub
surface context in Buckley Square has significant implications. The fact that the
artifact was recovered from an 8 inch diameter random soil core at 2.2 meters (7
feet) below surface raises the probability of potentially intact Native American
cultural material remains at this locale. It is critical that archoological monitoring
be conducted in tandem with any earth moving construction activity in the area.

Both Cleveland Square and Buddey Square were sites of a military cemetery
(seeFigurel.1) during the latter part of the 19th century. In the 1880s, bodies from the
site were re-interred at Fort Snelling in Minnesota and at the Concordia cemetery in El
Paso. Published reports show that during the fast 20 years, street reconstruction
activities have exposed human burials along Missouri Street, particularly between
Oregon and I\!fesa streets. These were remains of individuals that were inadvertently
missed during relocation to Concordia Cemetery. One such burial was exposed during
CBD II Street Rehabilitation Project in 1998.

This draft report comprises a very small part of the scope of work necessary to
adequately assess the potential impact on cultural resources, by the proposed
Cleveland Square Development Project. Further pre~construction research, involving use
of ground penetrating radar and archival documentation should be conducted to ensure

compliance with historic preservation laws.

A .BRIEF HISTORY OF F()RT BLISS

APPENFJIX JR
A BRIEF HISTORY OF FORT IlLl!SS

Following the Texas-Revolution of 1835-1836, the Republic of Texas laid claim to land as
far as the Rio Grande but Mexico disputed the claim. Furthermore, the Texas War of
independence, the invasion of New Mexico in 1841, and the annexation of Texas increased
tensions between Mexico and the United States. Soon, President Polk's expansionist policies
culminated in a declaration of war against Mexico in May of 1846. On December 25, 1846,
Colonel Doniphan and his ivfissouri Mounted Volunteers defeated the Mexicans at the Battle of
.Brazitos, 28 miles upstream from El Paso. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hildago was signed on 26
Feb 1848. The US took control of the northern banks of the Rio Grande. In what was to become El
Paso, Franklin Coons, a local postmaster and property owner leased part of his land to the U.S.
government for a military post (Sandstrom 1962).

As US military activity in the area increased, a military freight road opened between San
Antonio and El Paso. In 1849 Army officers and 43 enlisted men moved in to the presidio of
San Elizario. On 14 September 1849 under General Order No. 58, iviajor Jefferson Van

Home established a military post on the US side of the border on land (6 acres) rented from
Benjamin F. Coons, near where Mills Building stands today in dovmtown El Paso, and tlms Fort
Bliss was born. Initially, the army rented buildings from Franklin Coons who established more
buildings around the settlement for his trading and mercantile enterprise. The area began to talce
appearance of a small adobe village called Franklin.

Around this time, six companies of the 3rd Infantry arrived at Coon's Ranch and made
quarters in adobe buildings. The companies' main duty was to protect travelers on the road
bet\veen the Pecos River and El Paso (l\ietz 1988). The name of this installation vvas the "the
----..Post Opposite El Paso' (Timmons 1990). Soldiers protected local ranchers as well as

l

travelers on the stretch of road bei1r1een the Pecos River and El Paso. The Army abandoned
both the presidio and the post in 1851.

In 1854, Congress authorized funding to reestablish a rnilitary post in El Paso. The new post
was established at Magoffinsville. Over the next seven years, the garrison included the l st
Dragoons and a regiment of mounted rifles, as well as the gth Infantry. Troops from the post
fought against the Apaches in the Gila Basin and Dog Canyon, New Mexico (M:etz 1988 ;
Sandstrom 1962), among other places.

In July 1861, a Confederate force from Texas marched up the Rio Grande and occupied Fort
Bliss, which the Union Army had abandoned a short time earlier. However, Union troops
defeated the Confederates as they moved across northern New I\.iexico in the spring of 1862
(Timmons 1990). The Confederates marched down the river to El Paso and burnt down Fort
Bliss in August of 1862. It was not until after the Civil Vvar, October 1865, that United
States troops reoccupied Fort Bliss. The post then became part of the Department of
Missouri. Companies G and H of the 25th Infantry relieved the 5th Infantry at the post during
the following year (Metz 1988).

A flood destroyed much ofMagoffinsvHle and Fo1t Bliss in iVfay 1867. Troops moved to a
- - tent camp on higher ground. The 25th Infantry was transferred to Santa Fe t\vo months later:
Companies A and K of the 35thinfantry replaced this unit (Metz 1988).

The army moved to higher ground at Concordia Rane~ a mile north of the Rio Grande
(Sandstrom 1962). Buildings for what was called Camp Concordia were completed in 1868.
This new post became a supply base for the 9th and lOtJ:i Cavalries (the Buffalo Soldiers) that

2

were pursuing Apaches in the region. On March 11, 1869 the Army named the post Fort
Bliss in commemoration of Captain and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel William W.S. Bliss. The
24th Infantry arrived during this year. Units off the 25th Infantry and 9th Cavalry were at the

post from 1870 to early 1877, when the Ai-my abandoned it (Christian 1977; Metz 1988). In
January 1878, Congress authorized re-establishment of Fort Bliss at the Concordia site.
Conditions at the post were unsatisfactory, however, so troops moved to rented buildings in
downtown El Paso.

Fort Bliss at Hart's Mill (1880-1893)

A parcel of 135 acres was chosen for a fort at Hart's Mill on the Rio Grande, just above the
town (Sandstrom 1962). This fort was primarily a way station for soldiers assigned to the
campaigns against the Apaches in southwestern Mew Mexico, southeastern Arizona and
northeastern Sonora, Mexico. Adverse conditions-flooding, mosquitoes, contaminated water,
railroad encroachment, and air pollution from a nearby smelter-caused another search for a
site in the late 1880s. Fire destroyed portions of the post in May 1887, and only 17 soldiers
were on active duty there a year later (Metz 1988).

Fort Bliss At La Noria Mesa (1893-Presellllt)

By 1890, after an extensive search involving El Paso citizens and organizations, the War
Department chose a parcel of 1,266 acres ofland on the southern edge of La Noria Mesa, 10
miles northeast of the center of El Paso (Sandstrom 1962). Close to the city, this site had
adequate water, good soil, forage, access to railroads, and a strategic location. The
government solicited and awarded construction contracts in 1892 (Metz 1988).

OTHER HISTORICAL CEMETERIES IN EL JP'ASO

APPENDIX D
OTHER HISTORICAL CEMETERIES IN EL PASO
The following is a newspaper article in the El Paso Herald of November 11, 1911 by

Nom1an Walker titled "The Old Cemeteries of EI Paso; Burying Grounds 'Neath City
Streets: Where the Business of the City Is Now Daily Transacted, Were Graves of Many
Old Timers."
El Paso the new, is literary builded (sic) on the ashes of the old El Paso, the adobe town
of the days before the going of the gun man. Draw a rectangle to include the present
business district of El Paso and the northwest and southwest corners of the figure will
include abandoned cemeteries of the old town. Cleveland and Carnegie Squares were at
one time a sand strewn cemetery, where the departed of old Fort Bliss in the "Pass" were
buried.

The block where the Masonic temple now stands was a private burying ground before it
was deeded to the Masons by a loyal lodge man of the chatter biue lodge. Just east of the
military cemetery, now· the twin public squares, was the public burying ground
"graveyard" in the parlance of the Old El Paso, where the tovvn fathers were interred
under what is now Missouri Street, the YMCA block and the first Christian Church Site.

The military cemetery had none of the scenic equipment of the country churchyard which
Gray immortalized in the "Elegy". Instead of weeping willows, evergreen and ground

ivy, there was nothing but a sand waste with a few crosses and a cluster of picket fences
surrounding the graves of the officers who commanded at old Fort Bliss in the antebellum days.

A rock wall surrounded the burying place according to one of the early inhabitants, while
another believes that it was but a sand waste that extended from Oregon Street back to the
sand hills of the west.

l

No one of the pioneers can remember any of the officers or men of the United States
army who were buried in the government cemetery in the center of the present City, and
the greater number of the bodies were aftervvards removed to Concordia cemetery in East
El Paso.

The military burying ground was afterward deeded to the City by the government for use
as a park. It was called Buckler Square, then Cleveland Square and when the Carnegie
library was built on the eastern po1tion of the old cemetery, the block was called Carnegie
square in honor of the donor of the public library.

The public cemetery adjoined the military cemetery on the east forming an "L" with the
government cemetery. This cemetery extended. from Franklin street to Wyoming street or
beyond, according to the pioueers, and was used until Concordia was laid out in East. El
Paso. There were many more graves in this than in the government cemetery across the
road, now Oregon street, and an effort was made to keep the burying ground in repair,
although there was no grass or trees planted in there. This cemetery was afterward
abandoned, and, like the government one, was vacated when the bodies were removed to
the new one in East El Paso.

The 1859 plat map of El Paso by Anson Mills shows a Campo Santo at the top of
McGinty hill, on west Franklin which today is the south east portion of City Han Parking
Lot. An article in the El Paso Herald from around 1900 reported that skeletons were
encountered during railroad construction. The skeletons were identified as American
males and a female. "The teeth in two of the skulls showed evidence of modern dentistry,
they having been filled with gold and amalgum." The health officer ordered them reburied in the vicinity of their original burial spots.

According to the newspaper article, people were buried at the cam po santa for the first
time in 1851. During the interview, with the writer of the article, Judge J. F. Crosby

2

remembered names of some of the people buried there. One of them was William T.
Smith, affectionately called "Uncle Bill". "Vvilliam T. Smith (was) the first American
who ever owned iand here and the man who first owned the land that El Paso stands on
was buried there. He was kilted by a stage running over him near San Elizario."

"\.l\Tilliam Caldwell and a man named Conldin were also prominent men in their time and
were buried on the hill. They died at each other's hands and were buried at the same
time. Conklin was the manager of Smith's Ranch and Caldwell was a gambler, who was
knovvn all along the trail from St. Louis to San Francisco. They had a row and the next
morning met in a little adobe saloon that stood where the first National Bank now stands
and fought it out. They used pistols and both men were killed on the spot. We buried
them in that hill and a I suppose most of the Old Timers have long forgotten about them.
Some ofConk:lin's distant relatives still live in El Paso. I think in all there were about a
dozen men buried there and most of them were killed in fights or accidents. El Campo
Santo was abandoned as a burying ground in 1862.

US MnllRtary Cemetery

The military cemetery on Cleveland Square was established in 1861 on land donated by
Simeon Hart, a staunch Confederate supporter (possibly to meet demand from Civil Vvar
casualties). Colonel David Twig surrendered to Confederate soldiers in 1861. By
Christmas, El Paso had become part of the Confederacy. By Christmas 1862, the
California Column arrives. Fort Bliss surrenders and El Paso is back in the Union.

At the end of the Civil war, Fort Bliss was established at Magoffinville, the present-day
comer of Magoffin and Willows. By Christmas 1880, Fort Bliss moved to Hart's Mill,
the present day Hacienda Cafe.

Around the turn of the century, during the constrnction of the site for the YMCA human
bones were unearthed at the corner of Missouri and Oregon. In 1980 more human bones
were recovered from the same area next to Continental National Bank. UIBP
Anthropologists, Tom O'Laughlin and Rex Gerald ,~stimated burial date in the 1850s was
{">,,;!. ',~ ~~

I

:·'~

probably too early. Leon Metz is quoted tol'\that one of the people buried in the area was
Bill Johnson Leon (El Paso Times of October 5, 1980). "Bill Johnson, an early town
drunk, gunning for Marshall Dallas Stoudenmire, miscalculated his shot and was killed

by the marshal at the comer of El Paso and San Antonio streets in 1881." (El Paso Times)
Before the town boomed from railroads in the 1880s, small cemeteries were scattered
throughout downtown. The main public cemetery was located in the two blocks bounded
in the west by Oregon, in the north by Wyoming, in the east by Mesa, and in the south by
Franklin. "Around 1886, when new buildings began creeping up :from the river toward
this little cemetery, it was decided to remove as many of the interred as possible and

carry them off to Concordia .... [The] Trouble was, no one kept records on burial
locations. It was a hit and miss proposition to locate many of the graves, which hadn't
been well marked in the first place. Compounding the problem, the town drunks were

put in charge of relocating. Quite a few bones remained silently in the dark hiding places
and, to this day, come to light occasionally during street repairs''(Lopez 2000).

The Masonic temple was one of the first formal cemeteries in downtown El Paso. It was
located at the comer of Mesa and San Antonio streets in the 1860s. The city's oldest
Masonic temple was built in the 1860s where the Popular Department Store now stands.

It is uncertain where the second cemetery was located although some newspaper articles
suggest it was at the same general location as the public cemetery at Missouri and Mesa.
A 1916 plat map shows the Masonic temple on the block north of Cleveland Square
across l\tlissouri Street, the present site of the El Paso International Hotel. At the old

4

cemetery the Masonic buried their members on the temple compound. By the tum of the
20fu century city ordinance required burial at Concordia Cemetery.

OddfeHows Cemeteny

An 1894 nev1spaper article makes reference to the Oddfellows reparing their cemetery
but this may be referring to the section of International Order of Odd fellows at
Concordia. There is no known Oddfellows cemetery in downtown El Paso.

MASSACRE AT MIMBRES SPRINGS

MASSACRE AT MIMBRES SPRINGS
By

Barbara Dent
'"This is How They Tell IC
It is hard to visualize Mimbres Springs or Cooke's Springs, as it is sometimes

called, as the lush watering hoie and rest-stop for Indians, traders, and the Overland Mail
Stage. Today the Spring is covered by an old unused wooden building, built years ago by
the Southern Pacific Railroad. It is lying in the midst of the deserted adobe ruins of Old
Fort Cummings and the rock fence of the Overland Stage Coach "Ranch." Mimbres

Springs is near Cooke's Canyon, six miles northwest on the road to Cooke's Peak, and 16
miles northeast of present-day Deming, New Mexico. This is the place where seven men
were killed in a battle with Apache Indians, in the early days of the civil War.
"The Mesilla Valley of the Rio Grande, which formed the eastern extreme of that
part of Southern New Mexico called Arizona ... contained two-thirds of the population of
Arizona. It was isolated from the upper country of the New Mexico proper by a stretch of
desert called the Jomada del Muerto." This is the country in which seven men traveled on
the journey to death.
In 1860, the town of Mesilla, New Mexico, boasted a population of2,500 and in
1858 the Overland Mail began its route through this thriving community and it is here

that our story takes place along with Ft. Fillmore and Ft. Webster. Ft. Fillmore, located
six miles south of Mesilla, was in the middle of a hotbed of Confederate sympathy. When
the Civil Viar borke out, the citizens ofMesiHa voted in 1861 to become part of the
Confederate State of Arizona. Colonel John R Baylor's Texans caused the Union
sympathizers much unhappiness. Ft. Mc Lane, sometimes called Ft. Webster, was
established in 1860 and was abandoned in July of 1861, when its troops marched to Ft.
Fillmore. They were among those 800 troops from Ft. Fillmore who surrendered to Col
Baylor, CSA by Maj. Isaac Lynde, USA.

l

The U.S. Government was pulling back their troops on the southwestern frontier
for assignment in the eastern campaign of the Civil War, thus leaving the southwestern
settiements unprotected from Apache raids. The Indians took advantage of the "Yellow
Legs" absence and all tribes went on the war path.
The Mesilla Times published a notice on July 27, 1861, stating that Freeman
Thomas, Joseph Roecher, Emmit Mills, John Wilson, John Portell, Robert Aveline, and
M. Champion were found dead; killed by Indians at Mimbres Springs. This news was
brought into M:esilla by the mail rider form Pinos Altos.
W.Vif. Mills, brother of Emmit Mills, a prisoner charged with espionage against
the CSA, was at Ft. Bliss at the time and a copy of this newspaper was thrown to him
through the window of his cell. Later in life, he recalls the story in his book "Forty Years
at El Paso" which was written in 1901; he relies a lot on memory and on George Frazer's
account, written by 0. W. Williams, published in the Southwestern Sentinel, Silver City,
New Mexico, January 31, 1885, and reprinted in the El Paso times January 2q, 1887. In
his book, Mr. :Mills relates that he and his brothers were union sympathizers. While he
was a prisoner, hew-rote his brother Emmit, who was employed by the Overland Stage
Line on their ranch, Tres Hermanos, jus west of Mesina, and said that there would be
fighting between the Texans and the Union troops and he suggested that Emmit repo1t to
the commanding officer at Gt. Fillmore. This Emmit did, but he received no
encouragement and learning of his brother's arrest and being in danger himself from the
rebels in Mesilla, he attempted to make his way toward California with a party of six
other men in the mail coach.
"At Cooke's Canyon, about one hundred miles west of Mesilla, they were

attacked by a large body of Apache Indians under Mangus Colorado, 'bloody Sleeves',
and one of the most desperate frontier fights on record ensued. It appears that our friends
had time to gain the top of a little hill and build a stone breast-work about two feet high,
enclosing a space about 12 feet square ... Under a stone, on the top of the wall, Mr.
Denguere, a freighter, who found and buried the bodies, found a pencil note dated July
23rd, I 861 stating that they had been fighting two days and had killed many Indians, that

all were now killed or wounded except for two, that they were out of water and would try
to escape that night ... They were Emmit Mills, Freeman Thomas, Joe Roacher, M.

2

Champion, John Pmtel, Bob Avelin, and John VVilson. All were killed. The Indians who
sold their arms and watches in Mexico, said that they lost forty warriors in the fight."
Anson Mills, another brother, also wrote a book and published it hlmselfin 1921.

In his book he reflects on the pas, stating that on the eve of the Civil War, he left his two
brothers in the West and traveled to 'Vashington, D.C., to obtain his commission in the
U.S. Army. He learned ofW.\V.'s arrest and Emmitt's death from a New Orleans
newspaper.

In 1962 Rex W. Strickland edited W.Vv. Nillls's book for reprint and pieced
information together concerning the "death at Cooke's Springs." In this article, Dr.
Strickland states that on Saturday July 20, 1861, an Overland mail Co. coach, a «celerity
wagon" or ambulance coach, left Mesilla ·with seven heavily armed men aboard destined
for California and the protection of Federal troops. "One mile beyond Cooke's Springs
the occupants deserted the coach and took to higher ground." Here they fashioned a crude
rock enclosure on top of a peak On Sunday morning they were attacked by a combined
force of Apaches headed by Cochise and Mangus Colorado. The battle lasted for three
days, 1\1angus Colorado left after the second day, leaving Cochise to finish the job.
The bodies of all seven men were discovered on July 27th by the mail rider.
Probably this news prompted Col. Baylor to send George Frazer and 15 men to bury them
where they lay. There is some disagreement as to who buried them. Alejandro Doguenne,
leading a freight wagon train, is said to have found the bodies and buried them. Quite
likely Charles Brown and James Tevis were with the wagon train, for they claim to have
buried the "seven" also.
"Over the fortified spot was a cover of cedar boughs, perhaps to shield the
wounded from the July sun. Mills, Roescher, Portell, and Aveline were found in the
enclosure. Thomas and Champion were found 60 yards away and Wilson was found 150
yards outside with a trail of blood covering the path he had crawled before he died. Only
two of the bodies were scalped, but all were stripped."
There was no writing found; this is a veiy important point since W.W. Mills
speaks of a note left behind. Residents of Janos, Mexico, reported that both Mangus
Colorado and Cochise had taken part in the battle and had lost over 40 men. VtTatches and

3

other properties of these seven men were discovered in Janos, where the victors had come
to sell their spoils and to tell their tale.
Brian Garfield used this tale for the basis of his story, "Seven Brave Men." The
setting is Mesilla, New Mexico on the eve of the Civil War. The Apaches are on the warpath and the U.S. Army commissions the Overland Stage Co. to carry 50 new Spencer
repeater rifles with 5,000 rounds of ammunition through "the land that God forgot" to Ft.
Yuma. The story involves the preparation for the trip and the seven different types of men
going on the journey, all with their different reasons. Romance enters the scene in the
girls they leave behind. As the journey progresses, they are attacked by Indians and are
forced to "'fort up" above Mimbres Springs, where they put up a good fight, but they are
all killed.
Will Henry also utilizes this tale in his story of"The Seven Men at Nfimbres
Springs." Under the theme of intrigue and espionage, adventure and romance arrives in

El Paso in the opening days of the Civil War, in the form of a female Union spy. She is
attempting to get the loyal employees and the records of the Overland Stage Company
out of reach of the Confederates. Their plans for escape and their actual trip lead them to
Mimbres Springs, where they are all killed at the hands of Mangus Colorado, except for
the heroine. She walks away from the bloody scene and her past, her future unknown.
In different ways both Garfield and Henry make good use of the known facts and

myths about the massacre and invent the remainder of their stories in more or less
plausible fashion. The kernel fact and the only account contemporary with the event is
the article on the massacre in the Mesilla Times, July 27, 1861. The rest of the tale seems
to be taken from W.W. Mills, however, neither author gives him credit.
The author's preface in Mr. Garfield's book gives a good historical description of
the area and times, and gives the credit for the tale, as his source, to Mr. William S. Oury.
"On July 27, 1879, Omy published an article in the (Tucson) Arizona Star in which he
described the Cooke's Canyon Massacre. He had got the story direct from the lips of
Cochise, Chief of the powerful Chiricahua Apaches ... That is the story told here. It is the
true story of seven deadly men with a mission-seven men of whom Cochise himself
said, 'Give me twenty-five men like these and I vviH whip the United States Army."'

4

I found myself very comfortable with Mr. Garfield's story. The descriptions and
the language of the characters seemed appropriate, but the language of the author in the
preface surprised me with his untutored style and use of earthy grammar. He uses a
technique of generalizing on the time of events, giving an exact date only once, thus
protecting himself from criticism. In his story, Ft. Fillmore was still functioning as a U.S.
Post and the Silver City garrison (Ft. Webster) was soon to be "pulled out." This is in
keeping with the correct time scheme.
An Abbot and Downing mud-wagon mail coach was used and it was found empty

and below the massacre scene. The characters forted up on a rocky hilltop and made a
lean-to, to shade the wounded. Mangus Colorado and Cochise, with their combined
forces of warriors, participated. Water, or rather the lack of water, played an important
role in the story. The bodies of Thomas, Champion and Wilson were outside of the
enclosure. The only unbelievable part of the story was the exaggerated number of Indians
who were killed.
Mr. Henry seems to be a more polished writer, but quite careless about details in

his story. He goes far-out of the realm of reality and the mode of the time to relate his
tale. I found myself disbelieving in the plot and not participating in the action. His
characters invite no empathy. Mr. Henry's book begins with a prologue telling a tale
itself: of the death of an old "green-eyed" squaw named "Apache Annie." "Among her
effects, an age-yellowed diary, written in English, with a hand lettered map, and certain
other interesting objects." The attending physician is given permission to read the diary at
the time, while the son watches. When the doctor finished reading the faded book, it was
put into the "widciup fire." "It belongs to another time," said the son.
The setting of this scene is an "Indian Reservation outside a bustling atomic age
town in New Mexico." This leaves the reader with many choices, as many as there are
Indian Reservations in New Mexico.
Mr. Henry employs a heroine to tie his story with the prologue, but the reader

does not realize this until the very last page of the book. Then it is all explained in the
Epilogue. It seems to me, that the author apologizes for the story and puts the blame of
telling it on the doctor, who is no longer "the attending physician," but a discredited
alcoholic with a reputation for telling tales. "The reservation doctor, from whose memory

5

of that diary this account has been prepared, was definitely given to a rigorous regimen of
sour mash Kentucky Bond taken internally for pain as self directed. He was as well,
addicted to the manufacture and distribution of towering narratives when under the
influence of his favorite prescription, a fact admittedly not in the best interest of
authenticity."
The author then states that the doctor produced the "other effects" of"Apache
Anne." This contradicts Indian tradition of burning all of the possessions of the dead.
Why would the son only burn the diary and the wickiup in the ritual?
Another flaw in this story-telling manner is his treatment of the time element He
sets the ex.act time of the action as beginning April 11, 1861. This is too early for the
troops at Ft. Vvebster did no abandon the post until July, 1861; nor did Ft Filmore
surrender until July.
'¥hile on the journey, two of the characters relate the history of the area and
Apaches by means of the flash-back. Two wagons were used for this trip. The first one is
a "celerity wagon" and the second is a "springbed wagon." The characters must hide on
two occasions, only on the first "hide-out" does the lack of water become important. On
this occasion, the characters hide all day. Mr. Henry explains this with much detail, then
they build a fire to cook the evening meal. This defeats the purpose of hiding, in my
opinion. Only the Mimbres Apaches take part in the battle , but Mangus Colorado brings
his whole tribe for the show. This author has the bodies nicely together in the old stage
corral. There are building in this enclosure and they have 'Water store. A note is found
under a rock telling of their situation and the participants, leaving out the names of the
ex-slave, the heroine, and Culross, the Southerner.
The names and known facts of the seven men according to Rex Strickland are:
1. Freemen Thomas - Age 29 - Stage Co. conductor, and a grocer.
2. Joseph Roescher - Age 26 - Stage Co. driver and a native of
Germany.
3. Emmit Mills - Age 19 - Stage Co. clerk at his ranch, the Tres
Hermanos Station.
4. John Wilson- a sportsman who had killed Cochise's Mexican slave,
Jose, at Apache Pass a year before.

6

5. john Portell- a man who had shot and killed Virgil Mastin, a
secessionist, in Mesilla, May 17, 1861.
6. Robert Aveline- nothing is knmvn about him.
7. M. Champion - nothing is known about him.

Mr. Garfield gives the characters of his book their correct names, but he gives
them different occupations.
1. Fred Thomas - Overland stageline driver.
2. Joea Roacher - frontier trader.

3. Emmit Mills - exdragoon.
4. John Wilson-young adventurer.
5. Jack Protell-Age 60, wilderness scout.
6. Robert Aveline - desperado, who is credited with killing the man in
Mesilla.
7. Nat Champion - Overland Co. shotgun guard and scout.

There are a very few other characters, foils, added for conversation and
romance. Minor situations present themselves, but all things are focused on the
planned trip.

Mr. Henry, on the other hand, has many, many characters-too many! He
has to invent ways and situations of eliminating them. Then the attempts to use
this process to his advantage by ending up with the number-seven-at the massacre
scene. The explanation and introduction of his characters is confusing and they
are difficult to identify. The author kills the unimportant characters early in the
book and they are not mentioned in this paper. The remaining characters all seem
to belong to minority groups:
1.

Lucille Louise Henderson, age 19, alias Nancy Sue Benedict, who is a
professional Union Spy, posing as a Confederate secret agent The author,
too, becomes confused and in the second chapter of the book his spy
heroine has dropped her alias and is found arm-in-arm with "Madam
Lucy" on the way to becoming the best of :friends. "The American girl was

7

calling her new landlady 'Luz,' the latter was calling her new friend
'Lucy' and they were happily bound for the back garden irrigation
reservoir to talce a cooling sunset swim" in the nude. Not only is the
heroine in enemy territory, using the V<-lfong name, but she is already
completely out of character. The "young pretty, plainly frightened lone
woman" of page five is embatrassed at the sight of the Mexican
youngsters swimming with their parent in the river, innocent and naked,
now she is floating around with the Madam of "the best known and
highest class house of ill repute, west of the Pecos River." The author
attaches a completely feminine dependent personality to the character and
then gives her an assignment to get those operational records out of El
Paso and out of Texas, and to get out with them, if possible, the seven
faithful employees who guarded them." A ridiculous situation is presented
here. What could a Northern girl, not too bright and unfamiliar with the
area, do that seven strong mature men could not?
2.

Linn Sparhawk, clerk and stock tender for the American Mail Co., is the
leading male character. He is a young, smart, frail man dying from T.B.
He is a southerner, but a devout unionist who keeps with him his negro
freed slave, Simon Peter.

3.

Simon Peter plays a secondary character and at the end of the story the
Indians return the body of the "negro giant to put him to rest with the six
other brave Waterfield men ... after an unknown time ... a white party
venture here to find her seven wonderful men, they would not know which
had been Simon Peter, the freed slave."

4.

Jake Bergerman, age 60, company clerk. He is a native German Jew and
he po1trays a very weak simple foil.

5.

Ceferino Sanchez, age 16, is the brother of the Mexican Madam and wants
to become a United States citizen.

6.

Doc Hornaday, age 73, is the Stage Company driver. He is a veteran of the
Texas Revolution and the Ivfexican War, a drunk and a "teller oftaU
tales."

8

7.

Price Culross is a young good-looking southerner in charge of a
Confederate force often men, The Texas F...angers. He is taken prisoner

and is taken along on the journey.
8.

Today, standing alone in Carnegie Square in El Paso, is a monument, the
only visible memorial to "Emmit Mills and the six other brave men." This
monument bearing the story of"Mimbres Spring" was presented to the

city by General A Mills on September 20, 1920 in a "simple but solemn
ceremony." The story of these seven men and how they fought and died
has been told for over a century and has become a :frontier mythos,
folklore from the southwest.

Heroes Monument

Dear Stephen:
Please accept this correspondence as confirmation that I serve as the Vice Chairman of the
El Paso County Historical Commission. On several occasions, including our February 9, 2004
meeting, the Historical Commission has discussed the planned expansion of the El Paso
Public Library at Cleveland Square relative to its impact on the Heroes Monument.
It is our position that if it is determined that the Monument needs to be moved, then one
potential downtown location would be at Old City Hall/Aztec Calender Park. This triangular
shaped pocket park, (former site of City Hall from 1899-1960) serves as the main location
for a variety of war memorials.
The addition of the Heroes Monument would appear to be in keeping with the theme of this
park. However, I also do not believe there would be any opposition to it remaining at
Cleveland Square although it appears that a more suitable location would need to be found.
Finally, the Commission is prepared to place an historical marker next to the Heroes
Monument that would serve to better tell the story of the Monument and the heroes it
serves to recognize.
Should you require any additional information please do not hesitate to contact me.
Thank you and Best regards,

Re: Cleveland Square Project - El Paso, Texas

Hello Mark,
Bernie Sargent asked me to get in touch with you regarding re-burial of human remains
from the Cleveland Square project site in downtown El Paso. I thought if you had a
chance to look at the report it would make matters clearer when we talk about it (I'm
sending the report by overnight mail). This is an interim report I gave to the City of El
Paso to facilitate reburial of the human remains because we had completed studying this
aspect of the project and I wanted the remains reburied without delay. I'm still writing
sections on the artifacts and will produce a comprehensive report soon.

I will call you on Thursday morning, May 24, at lO·OO to discuss this project.
Thank you.
Regards

BACI(GROUND HISTORY OF PROJECT AREA

APPENDIXG
BACI(GROUND IDSTORY OF PROJECT AREA
The overall cultural region of the southern New Mexico, Trans-Pecos in west Texas, and
the northern Mexico state of Chihuahua was originally defined by Lehmer (1948) in his

study of the Jornada Branch of the Mogollon. The broad arid valleys and mountain
ranges of the Chlhuahuan Desert were home to native peoples for at least 10,000, and
perhaps as long as 30,000 years, before the first Spanish explorers visited in the 16th
century. The following is an overview of that history.

PREHISTORIC PERIOD

Lithic assemblages found in the Jornada Mogollon Cu1ture Area suggest that early
occupations in the El Paso area date to the late Pleistocene/early Holocene between
approximately 10,000 and 6,000 B.C. MacNeish's (1991) work at Pendejo Cave on the
Otero Mesa north of El Paso indicates that there may be considerably earlier occupation
of the region, but this body of data has not been completely analyzed and is still very
controversial. Projectile point types found in the El Paso area, such as Clovis, Folsom,
Scottsbluff, and Plainview, all firmly dated from the other regional contexts, provide a
strong support for the late Pleistocene occupations. Based on comparative archeological
evidence from sites of the same age in other areas, the general social and economic
organization of the late Pleistocene population appears to be characterized by small,
mobile bands subsisting predominantly on large game supplemented with the utilization
of wild plant resources (Cordell 1984).

MacNeish (1989a, 1989b, 1991) and MacNeish and Beckett (1987) proposed that the
Archaic period should be subdivided into four separate phases. The Gardner Springs
phase (ca. 6000±500 to 4300±300 B.C.) is characterized as a 0 simple scheduled seasonalround settlement pattern organized around a few very small groups. These Archaic
people were foragers engaged in hunting, and plant
collecting. People lived in small ephemeral camps on the desert floor around the playas,
with a few

living in mountain shelters such as Fresno shelter.
The Keystone phase (ca. 4300±300 to 2500±200 B.C.) was proposed as an outgrowth of
the Gardner Springs phase, with a continuation of small, microband camps and task force
sites, but with the notable addition of large pithouse sites such as the Keystone Dam Site
(O'Laughlin 1980) along the Rio Grande.

The Fresno phase (ca. 2500±200 to 900±150 B.C.) was coeval with the introduction of
early maize domesticates into the Southwest, and was subsequently accompanied by
some fundamental changes in lifeways. A substantial increase in numbers of sites
includes significantly more and larger sites in the Rio Grande and desert floor/playa areas
and the phase is characterized by MacNeish (1991 :691) as possibly year-round
occupations where the sites served as base camps for a radial rather than calendar-round
system.

During the Hueco phase (ca. 900±150 B.C. to AD. 200±100) people lived in seasonal
microband or task-force occupations, but with larger and probably more numerous
pithouse sites. The ephemeral sites include new site types such as rock-roasting sites
which indicated harvest and preparation of dese1t succulents (O'Laughlin 1987;
O'Laughli11 et al. 1988). MacNeish (1991:695, 697) characterizes this phase as a trend

toward larger and more numerous base camps occurring in a broader area.

4

Mesnlllla .Phase

The introduction of ceramic production around the first century AD. denotes the
beginning of the Mesilla phase, first defined by Lehmer (1948). Characteristics of the
Mesilla phase include the production of El Paso Brownware, a plain earthenware ceramic
type.

This development is accompanied by more pithouse architecture and the

beginnings of clustered settlements (MacNeish 1989a, 1989b; O'Laughlin 1980; Whalen

1977). The presence of pottery types from the Mimbres Valley of Southwestern New
Iviexico in the El Paso area indicates that long-distance material and information
exchanges were occurring between the prehistoric inhabitants of these two regions by
approximately AD. 750 to 950. Intrusive, non-local sheH supplements the evidence for

external influences. The proliferation of trade and shifts in settlement patterns may
indicate increasingly sedentary populations with a growing dependence on horticulture
(Cordell 1984).

Lehmer (1948) proposed a transitional phase to describe the period of adjustment from
pithouse to pueblo settlement in the Jornada Mogollon region. The Dona Ana phase is
generally dated between .A.D 1100 and AD 1200. It is characterized by an increase in
ceramic types from outside the culture area (Appendix A). There is dearly a growth in
population and of settlement systems in the El Paso area from the end of the Mesilla
phase through the El Paso phase which appear to have corresponding developments in the
Mimbres and the Casas Grandes regions.

5

ER Paso Phase

The elaboration of ceramic technology, as indicated by the introduction of new, locally
produced ceramic types such as El Paso Bichrome and El Paso Polychrome (Hill l 990a,
l 990b), as well as the appearance of new architectural forms marks the beginning of the
El Paso Phase, dating approximately AD. 1050 to 1375 (Lehmer 1948).

By AD 1375, the populations of the Hueco Bolson and El Paso area exhibited an abmpt

shift in socioeconomic strategies, with a dispersed, hunting and gathering lifestyle
replacing the previous agriculturally oriented aggregate village. Vvhatever the cause of
the subsistence shift, a relatively dispersed hunting and gathering lifestyle prevailed in
the desert region of far west Texas until the historic times, although some pueblos were
present in the Rio Grande Valley.

Spanish excursion into the region began during the first half of the 16th century. In 1536,
Cabeza de Vaca and his pan'y likely passed through the general area. On reaching
Mexico, he told tales of the Golden Cities of Cibola located along the Rio Grande. The
news inspired several expeditions. The first was led by Fray Marcos de Niza, and guided
by the Moorish slave Esteban, in 1539. In 1540, the Coronado Entrada became the first
formal European expedition to the Spanish Kingdom of Nuevo Mexico. In 1581 the
Chamuscado-Rodriguez expedition passed through El Paso. The Antonio de Espejo
expedition followed in 1582. On April 20, 1598 Don Juan Ofiate camped on the banks of
the Rio Bravo near Socorro and on April 30 he claimed all the land around for the
Spanish crown. In the El Paso area Oiiate met the Ivlamws who the Spanish called the
Mansos or the peaceful ones (Hendricks 1992).

Spanish travelers described the valley as a place with good land, climate, and resources,
including game, forests and mines (Peterson and Brown 1994). Spanish chronicles
indicate the Suma occupied the area southeast of El Paso, including the area that is
modem day Juarez and Esperanza, to Jurmano territory in La Junta as late as 1795. The

Manso occupied the Rio Grande valley north of El Paso to Hatch, New Mexico. Both
groups lived a nomadic life typified by small dispersed settlements with temporary
structures and transient camps. They subsisted on fishing, hunting, gathering and small
scale farming. The Spanish eventually incorporated the groups into missions and made

efforts to christianize them.

The Spanish also came into contact with the Apache. The Athapaskan speaking peoples
(Apache and Navajo) from the plains and the Northwest Great Basin area entered the
Southwest between AD 1300 and AD 1400. Thereafter, Apache roamed freely in west
Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Chihuahua, Mexico until early 18th century when
encroaching Comanches and Spanish began to compete for territory.

The Apache

subsisted on hunting and gathering supplemented by small agricultural plots and raids on
pueblos and Spanish settlements. (Peterson and Brown 1994).
Of all the native peoples in the region before the Spanish, the Apache were most
tenacious in maintaining their Hfeways at the fringe of Spanish settlement. The Apache
considerably forestalled pueblo, Spanish, Mexican, and Euro-American encroachment.
They raided and fought a guerilla campaign, but they too were eventually forced from the
desert landscapes of the region. They would remain unsuppressed until 1886 when
Geronimo, the last free Apache leader surrendered to the US anny. He was taken to Fort
Sill, Oklahoma where he later died.

During the l im. and 18th centuries, the Spanish imperial policy in northern New Spain
was to move indigenous people to centralized estancias, ranchos, haciendas, and pueblos
and to christianize them. The Francisicans set up missions to convert the Apache, Manso,
Suma, Pinos, and Tanos. With mission life came the encomieda or economic taxation
system bmtaUy enforced on indigenous people by both the state a..nd church. These

7

conditions led to the Pueblo revolt of 1680 by the pueblo Indians of northern New
Mexico led by Pope from the Taos Pueblo. The aftermath of the revolt led to the
establishment of Ysleta de la Sur for the Tigua and Socorro de lar Sur for the Piro
Indians, respectively, who accompanied the Spanish into the El Paso area during the
retreat. Some Piros and Mansos were settled in Senecu (Hendricks 1992).

The Spanish families settled on mission farms scattered from El Paso to Casas Grande.
The Spanish and the newcomer Pueblo Indians fuced Apache raids and mutinies by the
Suma and Manso protesting loss of land to the refugees and their Spanish protectors. The
Spaniards responded by establishing presidios and forcing indigenous people to settle
within 5 miles of the fortifications. To feed the aggregated population within missions
and haciendas a network of acequias and dams were established in the Lower Rio Grande

valley to support crops.

The 18th century saw lit.tle population growth in the El Paso Lower Valley. In 1692, Spain
had re-colonized New Mexico and some of the Pueblo Indians who had taken refuge in
the El Paso area had moved back to their original homes in New Mexico. Nonetheless,
Paso Del Norte remained an important stop on the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro half
way between Mexico and remote Spanish outpost of Santa Fe. The Camino Real
reinforced economic and social ties of northern territories with I\iexico. During the

Spanish colonial period intermarriage between the Spanish and the indigenous
populations in the Paso Del Norte resulted in the evolution of the mestizo community in
the area. Local villages, Y sleta, Socorro, and San Elizario, prospered. San Elizario
presidio 1vas established in 1789 to protect travelers on the Camino Real (Hendricks
1992).

fu 1751, in furtherance of interest to maintain peaceful allies, the Spanish crown

bestowed a land grant to the Tigua of Y sleta del Sur Pueblo. The Pueblo received one

8

league [(approximately 3 miles (5 km)] ofland to each cardinal direction of the church.
In 1791 the Spanish crovm issued laws assuring water to all pueblo grantso

The history of irrigation in the El Paso Lower Valley spans several centuries. No
evidence of prehistoric irrigation in the area has been discovered. Irrigation structures
were documented in 1659. In 1573, King Philip II issued ordinance on how to use water
in the new villages of the Spanish empire. It is conceivable that the Spanish attempted to
control water soon after their arrival in the late 1500s. Irrigation structures were probably
maintained by Pueblo Indians for mission development.

They were typically small scale earth structures serving individual communities
consisting of linear dendritic layouts with a main canal and laterals leading to field

feeders (Brown et al. 2002). Local officials called mayordoms (ditch mayors) were
elected annually to allocate water and work schedules to maintain ditches. In 1660, a mud
dam was built in El Paso del Norte. By the late 1600s the region had been transformed
into a prospering Spanish colony with irrigated fields of wheat and barley as well as the
native com. Grapes for wine, along with fiuit from Europe like quinces and apples,
joined the native plants that were still gathered by some native peoples like the Apache.
In 1754 farmers were taxed per grape vine to support a community dam. By 1760, half

the water from seasonal flow was used in irrigation.. In 1802 approximately 40,000 acres

(16,1888 ha) were under irrigation crops, maize, beans, squash, melons, sweet potatoes,
chlle, onions, sugar cane, apples, pears, and peaches in addition to staples of wheat for
flour and grapes. The region was famous for mission grapes. The population was about
8,000 all south of the river.

After Mexican independence from Spain in 1821, Y sleta, Socorro and San Elizario were
joined to form the district of Paso del Norte. The Mexican government, however,
recognized existing land grants. At the time of Mexican independence, the villages of
Y sleta, Socorro, &i.'1d San Elizario were situated on the south bank of the Rio Grande. In

9

1831 or 1832 the Rio Grande shifted its channel. The shift left Ysleta, SocoITo, and San
Elizario on the north bank in their present location (Peterson and Brown 1994).

On the north b~mk in what is today EI Paso County, except for EI Paso city, all other major towns

in the county including Y sleta, Soccoro and, San Elizalio were colonized by land grants in
the 17th century. By the beginning of the eighteenth century, the city of Paso del Norte,
Chihuahua, had a population of 10,000. In 1827 the state government of the State of
Chilmalma granted Don Juan Maria Pounce de Leon, a citizen of Paso del Norte land tract 011 the
north bank of the river. The Pounce de Leon settlement marked the beginning of the community

that would grow up to be EI Paso.

In 1836, naturalized Americans in Mexican Texas declared Texas an independent

Republic but recognized all Spanish Crown land grants. The Mexican American war
began in 1845 and ended with the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. By 1852 all
territories north of the Rio Grande; California, New Mexico, and Texas became part of

the United States.

Ame1ricalill Period (1848 - PreseliJlt)

Within a half century after the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, the last of the
Apache and southern Plains tribes were confined to reservations and the land was
effectively open for settlement by Euroamericans. In 1854 Fort Bliss was established in
what is today's downtown EI Paso near present day Mills Building. When the Civil War

sta11ed, the El Paso Euroamerican community, with the exception of the Mills brothers,
joined the Confederate cause. After the War more Euroamericans arrived in El Paso to
take advantage of lands confiscated from the confederates.

In 1873, El Paso was incorporated as a City and following the transcontinental railroads

in 1881 it became a major hub for east-west transit commerce in the U.S. Major

10

manufacturing industries included copper and iron smelters in historic Smeltertown. An

influx of European Americans into El Paso followed.

EARLYIDSTORYOFEJLFASOCITY

The history of EI Paso County is essentially the history of the Rio Grande Valley.
Although the county history is long and rich, the history of the city of EI Pa.so is
relatively young. Prior to the arrival of the railroad, the El Paso settlement was no more than an
adobe hamlet, surrounded by irrigated farms, vineyards, and orchards. The settlement began in
1827. On 25 September 1827, Agapito Alvo, the Alcalde of Paso del Norte, granted Juan Maria
Ponce de Leon a 400-acre tract of vacant land on the north bank of the Rio Grande. Ponce de
Leon kept cattle and horses in the area formerly known as the place of goats (Flynn 1997).

After Texas won her independence from Mexico in 1836, Ponce de Leon sold his ranch to

Beja.min Franklin Coons for $18,000. EI Paso was little affected by the Texas War of
independence in 1836 but the Mexican-American war from 1846-1848 changed lives here

for ever. Colonel Doniphan and his Missouri Mounted Volunteers defeated the Mexicans
at the Battle ofBrazitos. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hildago was signed on 26 Feb 1848. The
US took control of the northern b::i.nks of the Rio Grande. In what was to become El Paso,
Franklin Coons, a local postmaster and property owner leased part of his land to the U.S.
government for a military post.
On 14 September 1849 under General Order No. 58, Major Jefferson Van Home
established a military post on the US side of the border on land (6 acres) rented from
Benjamin F. Coons, near where Mills Building stands today in downtown El Paso, and thus Fort
Biiss was born. The army also rented buildings from Franklin Coons who es'"iablished more
buildings around the settlement for his trading and mercantile enterprise. The area began to take
appearance of a small adobe village called Franklin.

11

Ponce de Leon regained his ranch from Franklin Coons but died soon briefly before dying
on 1 July 1852. After Leon's, death his heirs sold the ranch to William T. Smith, John.
Herny§. Gilllet, Josiah Crosby, Vincent St. Vrain., William Morton, and Anthony Rohman in
1853. This self styled syndicate joined together in a business venture called the El Paso

Company. One of the first things they did was to hire General Anson Mills, pioneer builder, to
survey and layout a city on their property. Mills published his map of the city in 1859. The grid
and block system, and many of the streets existing today have not changed significantly since
Mills designed them. The young city retained the name Frank-Jin until 1873 when the town was
chartered (incorporated) and its name changed to El Paso. The 1859 A_nson Iv.fills map shows land
use to include three branches of the El Paso acequia and the Fort Bliss and MagoffinviUe Spille
accquia. Other landowners in the Project area include NW Pierpont, NE Hornick, Dowell and

Mills. Magonffinville bordered the project area to the south. The area north of San Antonio, and
west of Durango was unplated when the map was first published. Later they were added as
Blocks 152, 160, 161, 169, and 170.

El Paso's largely Mexican population had little interest in the American Civil 'Var. In 1861,

however, El Paso leaders voted 871 to 2 for secession from the Union. The Mills brothers were
the only ones who voted to remain in the Union. Fort Bliss, located at Magoffinville at the time,

became a Confederate Outpost and a depot for supplying troops fighting the Union army in New
Mexico and Arizona. The union army considered Fort Bliss as key to controlling New Mexico
and Arizona. In 1862 after suffering defeat in New Mexico the Confederates burned down fort
Bliss and retreated to San Antonio. The Union army reoccupied the fort. In 1867, however, Fort
Bliss was destroyed by floods and in 1869 a new post was constructed at Concordia on property
owned by Hugh Stephenson. The fort at Concordia was closed in January 1877 for lack of
activity and when the Salt War broke in 1887 buffalo soldiers were to be brought from out of
town to restore peace. In 1880, a new military post ·was built on a 135 acre plot at Harts mill

where the La Hacienda restaurant now stands.
Although Mexicans, the vast majority of the population, were not directly affected by the Civil
War, the war brought a period of depression, as in all other parts of the south. By 1875, EI Paso
was still a small economically depressed village and did not recover until 1876 when expectation

12

of a transcontinental railroad and associated coro..mercial prospect, attracted. investors to EI Paso.
Prior to the railroad era, EI Paso functioned as a half way house on the continent for the stage

coach. EI Paso, appropriately called "The Pass" because of its strategic geographicai location,
is accessible from a series of natural passes in the several chains or group of mountains which
circumscribe tl1e city (CD 1886-88:21). Owing to this veritable gateway to Mexico, EI Paso
became a convergence point for great trade routes including the Nor'd1-South Ca1nino Real
connecting Mexico and Santa Fe, the east-west San Antonio to San Diego stage trail (the Jack
.Ass Trail) and later the Butterfield Trail. Mules and oxen stage coach trails passed through EL

Paso. It is this same strategic location that .attracted the military into the area. EI Paso's hig..h.
desert climate typified by 20-100° F tempe:ratl!re, 12-18 inches of rainfall per annum is "so

healthy and pleasant that there is not a day in the whole year in which man or beast cannot
work out of doors witI10ut fear of danger or discomfort" (CD 1886-88). "It provides fine scenery,
salubrious air and health and life-giving atmosphere and climate"(CD 1886-88). Some of the
residents of the city were military retirees who had previously served in the area and liked the

clim..at:e.
By 1878 there were 23 A..mericans in EI Paso city, and about 150 Mexicans. A small garrison of
soldiers was quartered in the town consisting of a number of adobe houses of the pure Mexican
type. "So nondescript, unique, and picturesque were these structures to the unaccustomed eye,
that any effort to describe them would, we fear, fuil to convey a correct impression." The
metropolis of the county was then at Y sleta, thirteen miles below EI Paso, on the river, where the
District Court was held and county business was transacte~ and where there was a Mexican
._._ population of about 2,000 (CD 1886-1887:17),,,

During the years 1879 and 1880, the great railroads approaching here -Atchison, Topeka & Santa
Fe from the north, Southern Pacific from the west, the Texas and Pacific and the Galveston,
Harrisburg & San Antonio from the east - pushed their work of constrnction so vigorously, that
increased attention was directed to this place; and before the end of the year in 1880 though the
railroads were still more than 100 miles distant, the fust sound and wave of the coming "boom"
had struck EI Paso, and aroused the sleepy old adobe town from its fifty years of lethargy

(CD1886-88:18).

13

The first Southern Pacific train rolled into town amidst great excitement on May 13,
1881, inaugurating a coast to co:ist winter locomotive route. It was foHowed by Texas Pacific on
J<muaryl, 1882, Texarkana, DaHas, Fmt Worth, the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio on
January 2, 1883, Houston and New Orleans. Three weeks later, the Atchinson, Topeka & Santa

Fe connecting El Paso to Kansas City arrived. Finally, in 1884, the 1250 mile Mexican Central
Line connecting El Paso with Mexico Cit-y was completed; tlms increasing severalfold El Paso's
potential as an entreport or gateway to commerce ofIVfoxico.

Like the mule and oxen stage coach train trails before them, railroads and telegraph followed the

same lines of communications governed by natural laws of trade. The railroads transformed
El Paso from a half way stage stop between the east and west coast to a transportation hub of
intercontinental railroads with tremendous potential for commerce. El Paso (The Pass) became a
great regional and commercial center. Equidistant from Mexico city, San Fansisco, St. Louis,
New Orleans, Kansas City, and Galveston - about 1100 miles from each of these cities (1986-

1887 CD; 7); enterport for commerce of Chihuahua, Durango, Zacateca and other landlocked
Mexican States. El Paso residents were ecstatic about the prospects from railroad

envisioned their city becoming a Southwestern magnet for trade

commerce and

(1886~87

El Paso City

Directory).

Railroad related business had great impact on the growth and character of Downtown El Paso.

Downtown El Paso became an explosive growth hub and a variety of business ventures
sprang up immediately. In a short period of time, businesses in this area were transfonned from

extractive (Farming and mining) to secondary (construction and manufacturing), and tertiary
(transportation, communication and utility) enterprises. Dovmtown El Paso became a major
transfer point east west and north south.

By 1882 El Pa.-;o had Lights and gas and :m opera house opened in the ci!y in 1883. In 1886,
compilers of the City Directory summarized contemporary economic and population growth in El
Paso thusly: 11 A little more than four years ago there were less than 200 persons here, all told no
railroads, no modem improvements, nothing but a few old ooobe structures; and the tmw was
almost unworthy the name. Today 1.:ve have five railroads - the prospect just spoken of the

14

completion of others - and we have a population of 5,500 as wide awake and intelligent people as

can anywhere be found" (City Directory 1886-1888:9). By 1886, El Paso's phenomenal

gro"Wth surpassed Ysleta, San Elizario, and Socooro.
Economic boom in the city was further boosted by availability of raw material from El

Paso County and smTounding counties in Texas and New Mexico as weli as the state of
Chihuahua, Ivfexico. EL Paso county encompasses an area of 7,000 square miles (4,480,000
acres). It is approximately the size of Connecticut, twice the size of Delaware, and six times the
size of Rhode Island. EI Paso County population of 12,000 people was distributed as follows; EI
Paso, the County seat (5,500), Ysleta (2,000), Socorro (l,200) (San Elizario (2,000), Fort Bliss
(300), Concordia (300), Camp Rice (200), and the remainder of the county (500).

Its location on the fertile Rio Grand alluvial flood plain provided great opportunity for
agribusiness. EI Paso County had no less than 1,000,000 acres of alluvial valley. The potential
appeared so great, EI Paso leaders dubbed it the "Nile Valley of the Southwest". It had potential
for flour, hay, grain, pork, lard, butter, fruits, and vegetables.

The Maaufacturing industry thrived on Cheap coal in abundance in the Vvhite Oak coal field land

in New Mexico to create manufacturing industries such as reduction works, glass works,
~

Smelting and reduction works, Soap and candle factory, foundry and machine shop~

Light industries for processing food foodstuffs included dairy plants, ·wine distillery and brewery,
fruit canning factories, beef-canning plants, factories processing poultry and apiary funn

products, and a cracker factory. A Lumber industry was supported by timber from the great
~. . .,. White Oak mountains district ,

Reduction Works Industries and Mining Business flourished in El Paso. They took advantage of
tin from the Franidins, coal from White Oaks, New Mexico, high grade ore from Carrizal in Old
Mexjco, copper from Potrillos, Texas, copper from Carizall, Silver from Sierra Blanca and
CarizaU, Lead from Sierra Blanca, and bituminous coal from Fort Quitman,

Population grovvth increased demand for public local transportation. Inter-urban. Street car ran
the entire length of San Antonio to bring suburban commuters to downtown. An international

15

street railway ran dmv11 Santa Fe and Stanton streets in El Paso and Juarez Avenue in Juarez. El

Paso and Paso del Norte International Street Railroad; chartered 1882; in operation 1883. It
became the first international street car anywhere. It operated nine coaches over 3 miles of
road, inclusive of side tracks. The first coach is on display on Cleveland Square.

GroVi.1:h in population :further created demand for public schools and churches. One of the earliest

schools in the city, the First Ward School, later Franklin, vvas started in 1891 al 215 Leon street
at the request of wealthy parents in the area. Children from wealthy Juarez families
attended the school as well. The first kindergarten in Texas was at Franklin School. In
1886 EI Paso could be found church buildings owned by Episcopal, Methodist, Baptist,
Presbyterian, and Catholic organizations.

From the time the railroad arrived in the city to World War Il, Downtown El Paso enjoyed a
vibrant economy teeming with restaurants, hotels, and retail operations connected intricately to
the railroad. Five railroads, converged in El Paso in a period of less than four years between 1881
and 1884. The El Paso Union Passenger Depot constm.cted in 1906 became El Paso's "Grand
Central Station". Business related to the railroad industry flourished in the Dov.rntown EI Paso.

Hotels, saloons, rooming houses, warehouses, and retail stores opened to meet the
increased demand from passengers and railroad employees. SiTeet cars became a feature of
transportation v.iithin the city. Before long, street car service area expanded to include the city of
Juarez, Mexico. By the tum of the century El Paso was at a peak of economic boom.

fo the 1930s, however, downtown El Paso did not escape the problems of the Great Depression.
Some fumilies from Chihuahuita and Durangito migrated back to Mexico. Post depression years
continued to see heavy train traffic through El Paso in support of World Vvar Il effort. Businesses
survived. With the end of World Vvar Il, railroad traffic dwindled dramatically due to stiff
competition from the trucking industry thriving on an interstate highway network infrastructure.

The decision in 1969 by the City of EI Paso to locate the Civic Center in the Downtown El Paso
was aimed at kicking off a revitalization of the once prosperous Union Depot neighborhood. As
part of the plan, the city of EI Paso purchased Union Depot :in 1978. Today the Depot receives
AMTRAK passengers three times a week and serves as a. depot for Sun Metro City bus system.

Redevelopment of Cleveland Square is pmt of the revitalization plan.

In the 1890s, Buclder square housed a military cemetery from the Civil War era.
Sometime later, the remains in the cemetery were moved to a new location, so that the
square could be used for development. In 1904, the Carnegie Library was built on the
square. In 1954, the Carnegie Library was razed and replaced with the current public
library. In 2004, remodeling and expansion began on the public library. Between the
months of August and November in 2004, construction crews working on the expansion
of the El Paso Downtown Public library found human remains. It has been speculated
that the remains found were left by the initial move of the Civil War cemetery (Mbutu,
2004).

l

Human remains #1 were "recovered from over one meter below ground surface
on the northwest quadrant of Buckler Square" (Mbutu, 2004). The initial analysis
revealed that the skeleton was found in an extremely fractured conditio11. The
lower portion of the body was better preserved whereas the ribs were completely
fractured. The skeleton was severely damaged by pathology, which was most
prevalent in the lower portion of the body. The whereabouts of the skeleton's
cranium is still unknown.

foiitiai Analysns

Oriana Perez conducted the initial analysis under the supervision of Dr. Stephen K.
Mbutu and Dr. Catherine Willermet, at the University of Texas at El Paso, during the fall
of2004. The skeleton showed a large amount of pathology, which was best reflected by
the measurements taken by Ms. Perez. Specifically the measurements of the left femur,
the tibiae, and the right fibiula were reflective of damage done by sclerosing

osteomyelitis. The pathology will be discussed in a later section. A closer analysis of
these bones was done by Dr. Heather Edgar, and will also be discussed in a later section.
Ms. Perez took the following measurements during the initial analysis (See Tables 8.1 -

8.4).

Sex Estimatfom:

Present

Sex Estimation
In April of2005 Dr. Heather Edgar from the University of New Mexico's Maxwell
Osteology Lab in Albuquerque and Veronica Alvarez from the University of Texas at El
Paso examined the skeleton. It was determined that the sex of the skeleton is male. The
following indicators were used to make that assertion:
•

The shape of the greater sciatic notch is narrow

•

The sacrum is narrow

•

The femoral head measures 49mm

•

There is a lack of preauricular sulcus

* The skeleton is robust
This conclusion was in keeping with the earlier findings of Ms. Perez. Comparing the
measurements taken by Ms. Perez to ranges from Bass (1995), the skeleton was
confirmed male.

Age Estimation
Aging the skeleton proved to be more difficult. Due to the large amount of pathology

found on the bones, an estimated age range of 27-40 was given with the possibility of a
higher age range of 50-59. The earlier estimate of age given by Ms. Perez was based on
the analysis of one complete medial end of a rib,
"which exhibited a deep V shape on its stem.al end characteristic of individuals
from mid-thirtieth to mid fifties (Burns, 1998). Burns suggests that at this age in
males 'the superior and inferior edges have gro"\\'ll to the length of the centers.
The V has expanded in a cup-shaped center (Bums, 1998:57).' This trait
corresponds to an adult stage 5 (33-42 years) as determined by Iscan et al. (1985)
(Mbutu, 2004)."

In the examination by Dr. Edgar, 4 ribs with sternal ends wern apparent, but the ribs most
used in aging are ribs 4 and 5, which did not appear to be present. The ideal candidate rib
chosen most clearly matches to adult stage 4. The range of ages for this stage is 26-32
years of age. Dr. Edgar also confirmed Ms. Perez's findings that stage 5 was also a
possibility. However, the auricular surfaces showed evidence of an age range between

50-59 (Adult Phase 7), but this could be due to the large amount of pathology. The lack
of arthritic changes in the skeleton indicates a young male, especially at the promontory
of sacral vertebra.

Pathology
The pathology examination was centered on the bones that showed the severest
inflammation. This inflammation was likely caused by sclerosing osteomyeletis.
"Osteomyelitis is the result of introduction of pyogenic bacteria into bone" (Ortner,
1981). During sclerosis, there is a hardening of the bone (Steele, 1988). However, the
original infection was not apparent nor was the source of that infection. There was no
involucrum, sequestum or cloacae indicating bone death or pus exiting the bone. It was
unclear at the time of analysis whether the source of infection was not preserved or
whether the bone containing the source was not present. The infection seems to have
spread hemotogenously. There is evidence in the ribs that the pathology spread to that
area, as well. The following bones are those that reflect the greatest damage done by the
sclerosing osteomyelitis.

Left Humerus

The proximal end of the left humerus has been mildly affected by the infection; however,
the distal end shows severe infection. The deltoid tuberosity is greatly enlarged in the
distal half of diaphysis posterior to the medial epicondular ridge. This is also an area of
extreme irregularity with active periosteal lesions. It is extremely porous and irregular.
The region measures 57mm long superior to inferior and 17mm wide anterior to
posterior. The entire distal 2/5 of the humerus, excluding articular surfaces, is greatly
thickened and irregular. A break in the humerus shows that the medullar cavity is full
and the original cortex is no longer discernable. The new bone is dense, woven, and
mostly well healed.

Left Ulna

The left ulna shows minimal change, but some extra porosity to the neck of the bone

Femora

The femoral shafts are greatly thickened and irregular. They appear to contain mixed

areas of healed and active lesions. The joint surfaces seem unaffected.
Right Femur

Looking at a cross section, the original bo ders of cortex and periosteaJ bone are visible
only on the interior surface. The bone is heavy overall, and there are several areas of
healed and active lesions. The interior is mostly healed. The base of femoral neck has
active areas. Posterior surface areas for the glutteal muscle attachments (linea aspera)
have active lesions.

In a cross section, the original cortex is much less easily discemable. The left femur is
more vascularized than the right. The two femora have same characteristics but in

l

different proportions.

Tibiae
The two tibiae are less affected than femora or humems. The tibiae show little change
due to pathology. The right tibia, especially along the lateral aspect medial aspect is
bulged, but well healed. The lateral aspect is highly irregular.

Fibulae

In the fibula, both distal shaft superior to distal articulations shows periosteal change.
The left fibula has some similar changes just inferior to the superior articulation.

Metatarsals
The first metatarsal on the left is the only place with articular changes. There is possible
joint destruction where there could have been a pus exit hole and the source of infection.
There is an erosive lesion in this area. There is no new bone growth and the edges of the
bone are sharp and irregular.

Associated Artifacts

In the original finding of the skeleton, pieces of wood and square nails were recovered.

"Square nails indicate a late l 9 h century burial. A cloth button was also found on the
anterior of the right pelvic bone. Cloth covered buttons could not have been part of a
military uniform, because military uniforms of the era had metal buttons" (Mbutu, 2004).
During later inspection by Dr. Edgar, a suspender buckle and button was found attached
to a piece of wood. Several more coffin nails were also found in the debris. The skeleton
shows several areas of copper staining. Staining appears on the exterior greater sciatic
notch, specifically on the right os coxae inominate. There is also copper staining on
interior lumbar vertebra body, on the right 1st metacarpal, and on the external end of a rib.
A complete inventory of the skeleton remains can be found in Appendix A.

Human Remains Set #2 (Toddler)

Human remains Set #2 was found in the same general vicinity but meters away of human
remains Set #1; "The disarticulated bones of a human child were collected by the
construction crew from Buckler Square. The bones included a fragment of the mandible
exhibiting deciduous dentition" (Mbutu and Perez 2004). The original analysis of the
bones ages the child to be between five and six years of age. In a later, more invasive
analysis of the mandible the child was aged between 2 and 3 years. The sex of the child
is not discernable from the bones collected. Several pieces of the pelvis have also bt>,en
collected, showing that the epiphyses has not been fused. However, age and sex are not
conclusive from the pelvis pieces gathered due to the lack of a diagnostic bone.

Conclusion

In the initial report given by Dr. Mbutu, he concludes that "although all the elements of

human skeletons, described above, were recovered separately from the same general
vicinity on the northeast quadrant it is unclear whether or not they are related to each
other'' (Mbutu and Perez 2004). Human remains Set #1 was an interesting specimen to

11

analyze, because the pathology was so great that the bones, mentioned above, were
greatly enlarged. The enlarged bones were clues that movement during the last years of
this person's life was difficult. The remains will be returned to the City of El Paso's
Medical Examiner's office for reburial.
