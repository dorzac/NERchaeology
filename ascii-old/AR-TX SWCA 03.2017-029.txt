Intensive Cultural Resources Survey
of the Proposed Cottonmouth Creek Wastewater Interceptor Phases A and B

ABSTRACT
At the request of Brookfield Residential, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey for the proposed Cottonmouth Creek Wastewater Interceptor Phases A
and B in the City of Austin, southeastern Travis County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area is located on
lands that ultimately will be owned by a Municipal Utility District (MUD), a political subdivision of the
State of Texas. As such, the proposed undertaking is subject to review under the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). Archaeological field investigations required a Texas Antiquities Permit (TAP) be issued by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and SWCA conducted investigations under TAP No. 7856
issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
The proposed interceptor line is expected to disturb a 5,376.06-foot-long by 50-foot-wide area roughly
oriented north to south that encompasses approximately 7.04 acres north and south of Colton Bluff
Springs Road approximately 0.5 mile east of McKinney Falls Parkway, with an additional 0.7 acre pump
station pad at the north end of the alignment for a total project area encompassing 7.74 acres. The depth
of impacts is anticipated to extend up to 10 feet below ground surface. This represents the direct area of
potential effects (APE) for this project.
Investigations included a background literature review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel
testing of the project area. The background review revealed that five cultural resources surveys have been
conducted near the proposed project area; those various investigations as well as others resulted in the
recording of 11 archaeological sites north and south of Colton Bluff Springs Road within a 1-mile radius
of the APE. Additionally, a review of the Texas Department of Transportation Historic Overlay maps
revealed 36 possible historic-age structures within 0.5 mile of the current project area (Foster et al. 2006).
Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed primarily agricultural lands with broad pastures on the
gently sloping floodplain and rolling gravelly ridges of Cottonmouth Creek within the upland Blackland
Prairie environment. Previous impacts to the project area include erosion, vegetation clearing and grading,
agricultural and residential activity, livestock activity, two-track roads, fence lines, push piles, utility
installations (overhead and subsurface), residential construction, and impervious cover, such as asphalt
and paved areas. During the intensive survey investigations, which comprised visual inspection and the
excavation of 21 shovel tests along the alignment and four shovel tests within the perimeter of the
proposed pump station pad, SWCA identified no surface or subsurface cultural materials, except for
newly recorded site 41TV2529. The historic early- to mid-twentieth-century farmstead consists of three
historic standing structures: a well, a cistern, and approximately three additional small sheds situated
immediately east of the APE, with an associated historic artifact scatter along push piles within the APE.
In accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith
effort to identify cultural resources properties within the APE. SWCA identified only one cultural
resource site (newly recorded site 41TV2529), which is both within and outside the APE. The historic
artifact scatter portion of the site within the APE lies within a disturbed context and lacks integrity. As
such, SWCA recommends this portion of the site is not eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) or for designation as State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) and no further work is warranted.
The portion of the site containing the structures and features is outside of the APE and has not been fully
evaluated, since it is beyond the current project limits. Therefore, SWCA recommends this portion of the
site outside of the APE has an undetermined eligibility for the NRHP or for designation as an SAL and
warrants avoidance. No additional cultural resources investigations should be warranted within the
remainder of the project area, with the exception of the approximately 1,213-foot section not currently
surveyed due to lack of access.

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey
of the Proposed Cottonmouth Creek Wastewater Interceptor Phases A and B

INTRODUCTION
At the request of Brookfield Residential, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey for the proposed Cottonmouth Creek Wastewater Interceptor Phases A
and B in the City of Austin, Travis County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed interceptor line is
approximately 5,376.06 feet (1.02 miles) long; this alignment and a proposed pump station pad represent
the area of potential effects (APE) for this project. The APE is on lands currently owned by Brookfield
Residential and private owners that will ultimately be owned by a Municipal Utility District (MUD), a
political subdivision of the State of Texas. As such, the proposed undertaking is subject to review under
the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Archaeological field investigations therefore required a Texas
Antiquities Permit (TAP) issued by the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The purpose of this investigation was to identify and assess any cultural resources, such as historic and
prehistoric archaeological sites and historic buildings, structures, objects, and sites (such as cemeteries)
that might be located within the boundaries of the proposed undertaking, and evaluate the significance
and eligibility of these cultural resources for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for
designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). Investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian
survey with shovel testing of the proposed project area. All investigations were conducted in accordance
with the ACT and standards and guidelines established by the THC and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA), as well as the guidelines provided in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(National Park Service 2000).

PROJECT PERSONNEL
Brandon Young, M.A., RPA, served as Principal Investigator and Project Manager for the duration of the
project, overseeing overall logistics and organization, managing reporting, and agency consultation. The
survey was completed by archaeologists Mercedes C. Cody, Christopher Shelton, and Ashley Eyeington
on December 15, 2016 and February 27, 2017 under TAP No. 7856. Mercedes C. Cody and Christopher
Shelton prepared the report of investigations, while Carole Carpenter expertly produced all field and
report maps for the project. Lauri Logan provided technical editing and document preparation.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
The APE is in southeastern Travis County in a semi-rural setting surrounded by rolling, open pastures and
scattered and expanding residential housing. The wastewater interceptor alignment appears on portions of
the Montopolis, Texas (3097-213) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle
map (see Figure 1). Overall, the planned project area would impact a 5,376.06-foot-long by 50-foot-wide
linear area roughly oriented north to south that encompasses approximately 7.04 acres north and south of
Colton Bluff Springs Road, approximately 0.5 mile east of McKinney Falls Parkway. Included within the
APE is a 0.7 acre proposed pump station pad north of the William Cannon Rd expansion The depth of
impacts is anticipated to extend up to 10 feet below ground surface. The APE is bisected by Cottonmouth
Creek, a northward-flowing drainage that empties into Onion Creek roughly 3.0 miles downstream from
the APE. The APE consists primarily of open pasture characterized by tall grass and short scrub with
scattered oaks and various hardwoods particularly along the riparian corridor of Cottonmouth Creek.
Previous disturbances within the APE include erosion, vegetation clearing, agricultural and residential
activities, livestock activity, and the construction and maintenance of numerous two-track roadways and
fence lines. Other significant disturbances that are evident along the margins of the APE consist of
clearing and grading activities, utility installations (overhead and subsurface), impervious cover such as
asphalt and paved areas, and residential construction.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The underlying geology throughout the project area primarily consists of the Late Cretaceous Ozan
Formation, although a segment of the wastewater interceptor alignment also crosses Late Cretaceous
igneous rocks (Barnes 1974). The Ozan Formation (also referred to as âlower Taylor marlâ) is marly clay
approximately 600 feet thick. Late Cretaceous igneous rocks are pyroclastics often intruded with basalt
(Barnes 1974).
Four soil units are mapped within the APE that, in order of prevalence, includes Behring clay, Houston
black clay, Heiden gravelly clay, and Tinn clay (Natural Resources Conservation Service [NRCS] 2016)
(Figure 2). Behring clay (1 to 5 and 3 to 5 percent slopes) are mapped in the open pasture areas east and
west of Cottonmouth Creek along the northern half of the project area and are characterized as deep
permeable soils derived from shale, and situated on nearly level to sloping erosional uplands (NRCS
2016). Houston black clay (1 to 3 percent slopes) is located along the southern half of the APE and is
described as very deep, permeable soil derived from Cretaceous-aged calcareous clays and marls that
occupies nearly level to sloping uplands (NRCS 2016). As these soils developed in place, they have little
to no potential to contain intact buried cultural deposits.
The middle portion of the APE is mapped as Heiden and Tinn clays. Heiden clay (1 to 3 percent slopes)
and Heiden gravelly clay (8 to 20 percent slopes, moderately eroded) are described as slowly permeable,
well-drained, and deep soils derived from weathered shale and situated on moderately steep uplands
(NRCS 2016). The frequently flooded Tinn clay (0 to 1 percent slopes) soils correspond with
Cottonmouth Creek and are characterized as very deep, well-drained, permeable soils formed in
calcareous clayey alluvium. They are situated on floodplains of streams and drainages of the Blackland
Prairie (NRCS 2016). As the Tinn soil developed from alluvial deposits, it has a potential to contain
buried intact cultural deposits.
VEGETATION
The APE is situated along the margin of the Edwards Plateau and the Blackland Prairie regions (Everitt et
al. 2002; Kutac and Caran 1994). The Edwards Plateau forms a sharp boundary in floral distribution
between the thin-soiled limestone uplands and the wide coastal plains. Upland areas are dominated by a
mixed live oak (Quercus virginiana) and Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) woodland interspersed with
occasional grassy openings. Other tree species present in low densities throughout these areas include
cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia) and Texas oak (Quercus fusiformis). Shrub density varies between low to
dense in upland areas. Species occurring in low densities include Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana),
agarita (Berberis trifoliolata), and prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) with thick, mixed grasses in areas (Van
Auken 1988). Originally, the uplands of the Edwards Plateau sustained short grasses and the alluvial
valleys had deciduous forests (Black 1989:12). The lower elevation areas along the riparian zone often
include a dense understory of acacia (Acacia spp.), prickly pear, and other brushy species (Petrides 1988;
Simpson 1988).

FAUNA
Two biotic provinces divide Travis County (Blair 1950). The western portions of Travis County lie within
the Balconian biotic province that comprises the Edwards Plateau region (Blair 1950). The eastern
portions of the county are within the Texan biotic province, which extends from central Texas to eastcentral Oklahoma (Blair 1950). The APE is situated within the eastern half of Travis County at the
western edge of the Texan biotic province.
The Balconian and Texan biotic provinces are transitional zones from the mesic forests of eastern North
America to the xeric grasslands of the central United States. These provinces have a high faunal diversity.
Blair (1950) identified at least 49 species of mammals, 57 species of reptiles, and 23 species of
amphibians native to the Texan biotic province. The Balconian contains 57 species of mammal, over 42
species of reptile, and 15 species of amphibians (Blair 1950). None of the fauna for the Balconian is
restricted solely to this province (Blair 1950).
Some native mammals common to the Texan biotic province include: opossum (Didelphis virginiana),
eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), eastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), pocket gopher (Geomys
breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus
leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), swamp
rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus) (Burt and Grossenheider 1976).
Mammals common to both of these provinces include coyote (Canis latrans), gray fox (Urocyon
cinereoargenteus), mink (Mustela vison), muskrat (Ondatra zibethica), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped
skunk (Mephitis mephitis), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Historically, red wolf, bison
and black bear ranged into or near these regions (Burt and Grossenheider 1976; Davis and Schmidly
1994; Schmidly 1983).
The general reptilian assemblage for both provinces include the Great Plains rat snake (Elaphe guttata
emoryi), eastern yellowbelly racer (Coluber constrictor flaviventris), yellow mud turtle (Kinosternon
flavescens flavescens), bullfrog (Rana catesbiana), southern leopard frog (Rana utricularia), and the Gulf
Coast toad (Bufo valliceps) (Blair 1950; Conant and Collins 1998; Kutac and Caran 1994; Werler and
Dixon 2004).

CULTURAL SETTING
Situated in southern Travis County, the APE lies within the Central Texas archaeological region, as
defined by Collins (1995) and Prewitt (1981). This area is noted by its distinctive environmental
conditions, as it is located at the boundary of the moist, humid forests to the east and drier, savannah-like
grasslands to the west that greatly influenced cultural development. The following cultural-historic
outline is based on the regional chronologies proposed by Collins (1995) and Johnson and Goode (1994),
which build upon the seminal efforts of Suhm (1960) and Prewitt (1981, 1985). Using standard
terminology, the cultural sequence is divided into four periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric,
and Historic. The Archaic period is subdivided into four subperiods: Early, Middle, Late, and
Transitional.
PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Paleoindian artifacts and sites date from about 11,500 to 8800 years before present (B.P.) and are not
uncommon in Central Texas (Collins 1995, 2004), but are fairly rare in the APE (Bever and Meltzer
2007). The period begins at the close of the Pleistocene with the earliest evidence of humans in the
Central Texas region. Diagnostic artifacts of the period include lanceolate-shaped, fluted projectile points

such as Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview types. These projectile points were hafted onto wooden spears,
launched from atlatls (spear throwers), and used to hunt a variety of game, including mammoth,
mastodons, bison, camel, and horse (Black 1989). During the Paleoindian period, the prominent
interpretation suggests a hunter-gatherer adaptation strategy with increased harvesting of flora and small
game as the big game died off and the climate warmed following the end of the Pleistocene ice age.
Representative Central Texas Paleoindian sites include Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, Gault, and
St. Maryâs Hall (Collins 1995).
ARCHAIC PERIOD
As the Paleoindian period came to an end, humans began to harvest more intensively local floral and
faunal resources (Collins 1995, 2004). Material culture became more diverse and the use of burned rock
middens and ovens became widespread. This period is known as the Archaic period and dates from
approximately 8800 to 1200 B.P. in Central Texas (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994). While
Collins (1995) and Johnson and Goode (1994) subdivide the Archaic into Early, Middle, and Late
subperiods, we have added the Transitional subperiod after the Late Archaic for reasons discussed below.
EARLY ARCHAIC
Early Archaic artifacts and sites date from about 8800 to 6000 B.P. (Collins 1995). Once thought to be
Paleoindian in age, some unstemmed point types, such as Angostura, have recently been recognized as the
first Early Archaic diagnostic styles (Collins 1995). By about 8000 B.P., these points were replaced by
stemmed varieties such as Early Split Stem, Martindale, and Uvalde (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Most
sites were open campsites although cave sites have been found (Collins 1995). Current site distribution
data suggest that Early Archaic peoples were concentrated along the eastern and southern margins of the
Edwards Plateau in areas with more stable water sources (Collins 1995; McKinney 1981). Specialized
tools, perhaps used in woodworking, known as Guadalupe and Nueces bifaces, were prevalent in this
period (Collins 1995). While subsistence data are sparse, it appears that people hunted deer and other
small animals, fished, and cooked bulbs in earth ovens (Collins 1995). This strategy evolved, in part, due
to the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene (McKinney 1981).
MIDDLE ARCHAIC
Middle Archaic artifacts and sites date from about 6000 to 4000 B.P. with multi-use bifacial knives
becoming more common. Characteristic Middle Archaic projectile points include Bell, Andice, Taylor,
Nolan, and Travis, several of which are deeply notched (Black 1989). These artifacts could have served as
knives and projectile points. Bison were hunted intensively at the start of the Middle Archaic but, as the
climate became drier, a reliance on dry climate plants such as sotol probably became common. The end of
the Middle Archaic may have been the most xeric conditions ever in Central Texas (Collins 1995). The
climatic change was accompanied by a technological shift as Nolan and Travis points, which are thick
and have narrow blades, first appeared in the archaeological record (Collins 1995). Burned rock middens
and earth ovens first appeared ca. 5000 B.P. and became increasingly common, although their exact
functions may have varied based on the culture and environment (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Representative sites of the Texas Middle Archaic include the Landslide, Wounded Eye, Gibson, and
Panther Springs (Collins 1995).
LATE ARCHAIC
Late Archaic artifacts and sites date from about 4000 to 2250 B.P. The period began with very xeric
conditions but gradually became more mesic (Collins 1995). Characteristic dart point types include
Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, and Marcos (Collins 1995). Increasingly complex and sedentary cultural

manifestations first appeared in the Late Archaic. Sites of the Late Archaic are very common and include
burned rock middens, open campsites, and lithic procurement sites. Population increases are evidenced by
large cemeteries and grave goods. Also, trade and exchange networks between cultures appear to have
increased in complexity as evidenced by exotic goods in sites and cemeteries (Black 1989). Bement
(1991) interprets the evidence for group investment in territory due to evidence in the Thunder Valley
sinkhole cemetery, dated to 2900 B.P. based on stratigraphy, to indicate that groups were declaring control
over a particular territorial range during the Late Archaic. Representative sites of the Central Texas Late
Archaic include the Anthon and Loeve Fox sites (Collins 1995).
TRANSITIONAL ARCHAIC
As Collins (1995:384â385) notes, diverse and comparatively complex archaeological manifestations
toward the end of the Late Archaic attest to the emergence of kinds of human conduct without precedent
in the area. This period (2250â1250 B.P.), referred to as the Transitional Archaic (Turner and Hester
1999) or Terminal Archaic (Black 1989), is not recognized by all researchers. Other chronologies extend
the Late Archaic to 1200â1250 B.P. (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994) to encompass this later
subperiod. Johnson et al. (1962) originally designated the Transitional Archaic as a subperiod of the
Archaic because of the similarities between the latest dart point types and the earliest arrow point types.
Since then, however, the designation has failed to be universally accepted by researchers. In two
chronologies for Central Texas, Collins (1995) does not include the Transitional as a subperiod of the
Archaic, and Johnson and Goode (1994) separate the Late Archaic into two subperiods designated Late
Archaic I and Late Archaic II. The Transitional Archaic, as it is used here, closely corresponds to Johnson
and Goodeâs (1994) Late Archaic II, but begins after the appearance of the Marcos point typeânot with
it. In this scheme, the Transitional Archaic coincides with the last two style intervals recognized by
Collins (1995:Table 2) for the Late Archaic subperiod.
During the Transitional Archaic, smaller dart point forms such as Darl, Ensor, Fairland, and Frio were
developed (Turner and Hester 1999). These points were probably ancestral to the first Late Prehistoric
arrow point types and may have overlapped temporally with them (Hester 1995; Houk and Lohse 1993).
Several researchers believe that the increased interaction between groups at the end of the Late Archaic
was an important catalyst for cultural change (Collins 1995; Johnson and Goode 1994). This change may
have included increased regional stress and conflict between groups as interaction became more frequent
(Houk et al. 1997). In Bexar County, for instance, researchers noted a distinct shift in settlement patterns
during this period (Houk et al. 1997). Groups apparently used hilltops as camps rather than just lithic
procurement locations. These elevated locations would have provided points from which to observe game
and other groups of humans as they moved through the surrounding creek valleys and upland prairies
(Houk et al. 1997).
LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
By the end of the Transitional Archaic, the bow and arrow was introduced, as indicated by the
increasingly smaller size of projectile points. The Late Prehistoric period dates from 1250 to 260 B.P.
(Collins 1995). Characteristic artifacts include small arrow points such as Perdiz and Scallorn, as well as a
variety of specific-use tools. The Austin and Toyah intervals of the Late Prehistoric, originally recognized
by Suhm (1960) and Jelks (1962) remain accepted divisions for the period. These style intervals may
represent distinct cultural entities (Johnson 1994), although others challenge this view (Black and Creel
1997).
During the earlier Austin interval, use of burned rock middens may have reached its maximum, based on
conclusions by Black and Creel (1997). Characteristic arrow points of the Austin interval include Scallorn

and Edwards (Collins 1995; Turner and Hester 1999). By the Toyah interval, plain-ware ceramics
appeared, indicating possible influence in the Central Texas region from ceramic-producing cultures to
the east and north (Perttula et al. 1995). Contrary to bog pollen data (Collins et al. 1993), data from Hallâs
Cave in Kerr County indicate that the climate of Central Texas began to dry around 1000 B.P. (Toomey et
al. 1993). This drying trend may have resulted in a change in vegetation that made Central and South
Texas more conducive to bison migration into the area. Bison remains in archaeological sites in the region
became common after 750 B.P. (Dillehay 1974; Huebner 1991).
Most Toyah sites have the distinctive Perdiz arrow point type, and some sites also have bison processing
tool kits. This technological change has been interpreted by Johnson (1994) as a spread of an ethnic group
and by Ricklis (1992) as the spread of technological ideas in response to opportunities provided by
increased bison populations in the Late Prehistoric. It is thought that during the Late Prehistoric period,
subsistence strategies became increasing complex and that human populations were very high (Black
1989; Collins 1995). Representative sites of the Central Texas Late Prehistoric include the Kyle, Smith,
and Currie Sites (Collins 1995).

SPANISH COLONIAL/MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE PERIOD (1630â1820S)
In the early Historic period (A.D. 1630 to present), the period of European contact and settlement in
Texas, the general Austin area was inhabited by several aboriginal groups including the Jumano,
Tonkawa, Lipan Apache and Comanche (Newcomb 2002). The first Europeans into the area were
probably Spanish missionaries who established three missions at nearby Barton Springs in 1730 (Webb
1952). The Spanish mission period in this area was of short duration and failed to colonize or even tame
the area south of the Colorado River and north of Onion Creek. An aboriginal presence thus continued in
the Austin area into the 1860s.
After Mexico gained independence from Spain, the newly formed country used a policy of land grants to
attract Anglos from the United States to help inhabit the sparsely populated northern regions of Mexico.
During the 1820s, Stephen F. Austin obtained grants from the Mexican government to settle hundreds of
families along the lower Brazos and Colorado Rivers (Webb 1952). This colony, known as the âOld
Three Hundred Colony,â was successful in pushing the European settlement frontier further west into the
Central Texas region. Prior to the Texas Revolution, most of the âOld Three Hundred Colonyâ settlement
was focused south of Bastrop and the old La Bahia Road (Webb 1952).

REPUBLIC OF TEXAS/PRE-CIVIL WAR (1836â1860)
During the Texas Revolution with Mexico, the area continued to be inhabited only by aboriginal Native
Americans. After the war, a growing Texan population led many settlers to move northwards in search of
open, profitable land to plant crops and raise cattle. This wave of migration spurned new conflicts with
the native groups living in the area, cumulating in the Battle of Brushy Creek, near what is today the town
of Taylor, in February of 1839. This battle, between the Comanche and the Texas Raiders, resulted in
numerous deaths and eventually resulted in the removal of the Native American presence in the area.

THE POSTâCIVIL WAR TO TWENTIETH CENTURY (1865â1950)
Subsequent to the Civil War, Texas entered the Reconstruction period. To begin reconstruction federal
troops, in part, had to spread the word of the Emancipation Proclamation (Campbell 2003:268). In
Galveston on June 19, 1865, General Gordon Granger and the Union army spread the word of the slavesâ
emancipation (Campbell 2003:268). Thus, this day became known as âJuneteenthâ and has been
celebrated by Texas African Americans ever since (Campbell 2003:268).

Recovery during this period was gradual, but was assisted by a diverse agricultural economy particularly
cattle. In the 1870s, several major cattle trails heading to markets passed through Central Texas. One
invention that had an effect on Texas and its economy during this time was barbed wire. Barbed wire, first
demonstrated in 1871, enabled ranchers to alter land and control cattle in a less-intrusive, more profitable
manner, and brought additional commerce and trade to central and South Texas (NRHP 1976). Though
barbed wire was one of the largest influences on Texas in general, the most influential âinventionâ on the
region was the railroad. The railroads effectively served as a means of transportation and, to varying
degrees, generally bolstered growth in the economies of the region.
Lawlessness became a problem during the 1880s, and Travis and Central Texas counties experienced a
period of âmob rule.â Citizens formed an anti-mob organization, but competing groups conducted
essentially open warfare. After several people were killed, the Texas Rangers were dispatched to the area
and order was eventually restored (Murphy 2007).
Throughout the early twentieth century, trade, transportation, and tourism continued to bring economic
prosperity to the region. The establishment of military facilities and the activity surrounding World War I
and World War II kept the railway system active and commercial activity in the east prospered. Through
the remainder of the twentieth century, population in Central Texas increased largely due to expansion
and commercial opportunities in urban and rural areas. The construction of public highways and
automobiles facilitated the commuting of Central Texas citizens to urban employment.

BACKGROUND REVIEW AND HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
SWCA conducted a thorough background literature review of the project area. An SWCA archaeologist
reviewed the Montopolis, Texas (3097-213) USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map on the THC
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (THC 2016) database, including searching for pertinent records
pertaining to the project area. These sources provided information on the nature and location of
previously conducted cultural resources surveys, previously recorded historic and/or prehistoric
archaeological sites, NRHP districts and properties, SALs, Official Texas Historical Markers, Registered
Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys within or near the project area.
Additionally, SWCA examined the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Texas Historic Overlay
Maps, a mapping/geographic information system (GIS) database with historic maps and resource
information covering most portions of the state (Foster et al. 2006).
The background literature review determined that five cultural resources surveys are known to have been
conducted near the proposed project area; those various investigations as well as others resulted in the
recording of 11 archaeological sites north and south of Colton Bluff Springs Road within a 1-mile radius
of the APE (Table 1). Additionally, a review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay maps revealed 36 possible
historic-age structures within a 0.5-mile radius of the current project area (Foster et al. 2006). The
background review noted no cemeteries within or adjacent to the project area.
In March 2003, SWCA conducted a cultural resources survey on behalf of U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development just south of Colton Bluff Springs Road in Travis County, Texas (Houk et al.
2003). Investigators identified a historic farmstead (41TV2033) with historic features (e.g., residence
structure and well) and scattered artifacts (Houk et al. 2003). The historic farmstead (41TV2033) is
interpreted as dating from the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries and was recommended as not
eligible for the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. No further investigations were recommended (Houk
et al. 2003).

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey
of the Proposed Cottonmouth Creek Wastewater Interceptor Phases A and B

In 2006 and 2007, a cultural resources survey was performed by Halff Associates for the McKinney Falls
Parkway Expansion Project between East William Cannon Drive and Thaxton Road in Travis County,
Texas (Leezer 2007). Two archaeological sites (41TV2196 and 41TV2197) were identified during the
survey, both represented by dispersed prehistoric lithic scatters primarily consisting of tested cobbles,
cores, and primary stage debitage (Leezer 2007). Based on the natural and artificial impacts to the sites, as
well as the lack of diagnostic artifacts, both sites were recommended as not eligible for the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL, and no further work was recommended (Leezer 2007).
In March 2009, EComm conducted an archaeological survey on behalf of Travis County Transportation
and Natural Resources for the extension of Slaughter Lane west of Thaxton Road (Butler and Feit 2009).
The project recorded two historic sites (41TV2333 and 41TV2334), both historic farmsteads with artifact
scatters dating from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. Both sites were recommended as not
eligible for the NRHP or for designation as an SAL with no further work or research warranted (Butler
and Feit 2009).
In January 2010, EComm conducted an archaeological survey on behalf of the City of Austin for the
expansion of water lines for the South IH-35 Water/Wastewater Program Project (Butler and Feit 2010).
The survey resulted in the discovery of one archaeological site (41TV2366), an early-twentieth-century
historic farmstead recommended not eligible for the NRHP or for designation as an SAL within the
project area (Butler and Feit 2010). Additionally, another previously recorded cultural resource site
(41TV1096) was revisited and the investigations determined the entire site had been destroyed (Butler
and Feit 2010).
In March 2014, SWCA conducted a survey on behalf of Travis County for the Easton Park Development
east of McKinney Falls Parkway (Stotts et al. 2014). This survey resulted in the discovery of two
archaeological sites (41TV2458 and 41TV2459), characterized as an early- to late-twentieth-century
historic farmstead and a late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century historic farmstead. Both were
recommended as not eligible for the NRHP or for designation as an SAL and no further work was
warranted (Stotts et al. 2014). In addition, previously recorded site (41TV2366) initially identified by
EComm in 2009 was revisited, tested further, and recommended as not eligible for the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL with no further work or research warranted within the Easton Park project area
(Stotts et al. 2014).
The review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay maps revealed 36 possible historic-age structures adjacent to
the project area (Foster et al. 2006). The 36 structures are depicted adjacent to the existing Colton Bluff
Springs Road and McKinney Falls Parkway on maps dating to 1896 and 1955. No earlier maps were
available; therefore, the dates of construction are unknown. SWCA also conducted a review of historic
maps from HistoricAerials.com (2017) to determine if any historic-age built resources were located
within the project area and to develop an idea of land development over time. SWCA reviewed aerial
maps dated to 1964, 1965, 1966, 1973, 1985, 1986, 1995, 2004, 2008, 2010, and 2012. Of the 36
structures depicted, three possible historic-age structures are shown to be adjacent to the currently
proposed project area. On the 1964, 1985, 1995, and 2004 maps, the project area appears to have been
used for a mixture of ranching and agricultural activities with minor disturbances from land clearing and
the construction of the existing Colton Bluff Springs Road. By 2015, the large Easton Park Housing
Development and associated roads northwest of the project area had been constructed.

FIELD METHODS
SWCAâs investigations consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations within
the direct APE. Archaeologists examined the ground surface and extensive exposures for cultural
resources. Subsurface investigations consisted of systematic shovel test excavations. For a linear corridor
survey, THC survey standards minimally require that for every 100 feet of survey corridor width, 16
shovel tests need to be excavated every mile. For a project of this size (i.e., 5,376.06 feet), the shovel test
investigations would require between 16 and 17 shovel tests. THC survey standards for an areal survey
consists of 3 shovel tests per acre when the project area is less than 2 acres. The proposed pump station
pad (0.7 acres) would require 3 shovel tests.
SWCA archaeologists employ both metric (centimeters and meters) and English units of measurement
(inches and feet) when conducting investigations within a project area. In compliance with archaeological
standard practices, investigations such as shovel tests, auger probes, and backhoe trenches are recorded
using metric units. Prehistoric archaeological resources, such as campsites, features, and artifacts, are also
recorded using metric units, whereas historic resources, such as farmsteads and associated historic
features, are recorded using English units; no conversions for these measurements are provided.
Shovel testing was primarily utilized systematically throughout the entire project area. The amount of
shovel tests decreased depending on the level of previous disturbances and the nature of the soils. Shovel
testing was not conducted in areas where impervious substrates (i.e., asphalt, concrete, compact gravel,
and/or caliche) were present and where evidence of extensive ground surface disturbance was observed,
within 5 m of any identified/marked buried utility markers, or within 5 m of any paved/graveled road
edges. Shovel tests were excavated in approximately 20-centimeter (cm) arbitrary levels to culturally
sterile deposits or compact soils, whichever came first.
Archaeologists screened the matrix through Â¼-inch mesh. The location of each shovel test was plotted
using a hand-held sub-meter accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver and was recorded on
appropriate project forms in SWCAâs field tablets. SWCA conducted a non-collection survey; artifacts,
had any been encountered, would have been tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the field, but not
collected. Following the review and acceptance of the final cultural resources report, all records and
photographs will be curated with the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas
at Austin, per requirements of the ACT in accordance with the CTA guidelines.

FIELD SURVEY RESULTS
On December 15, 2016 and February 27, 2017, SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian
survey with shovel testing of the proposed approximately 5,376.06-foot-long (1.02-mile) by 50-foot wide
alignment (7.04 acres) for the Cottonmouth Creek Wastewater Interceptor Phases A and B. Additionally,
the APE includes a 0.7 acre proposed pump station pad. Investigations included surface and subsurface
investigations as necessary, based on field conditions (Figure 3).
Visual examination of the project area revealed primarily agricultural lands with broad pastures on the
gently sloping floodplain and rolling gravelly ridges along Cottonmouth Creek within the upland
Blackland Prairie environment (Figure 4). Cottonmouth Creek exhibits one main channel roughly 1 foot
deep with rounded banks and several shallower channels winding through the floodplain, suggestive of a
braided channel network (Knighton 1998). These channels merge as water flows downstream to create a
single channel that is roughly 3 feet deep and 8 feet wide (Figure 5). This fluvial arrangement is typically
associated with frequent lateral accretion and erosion (Knighton 1998). Accordingly, the lateral
movement of the drainage may affect the integrity of any cultural deposits (if present) that may be buried.

Vegetation throughout the project area consists of tall grasses and short scrub with scattered oaks and
various hardwoods, particularly along the riparian corridor of Cottonmouth Creek. Ground surface
visibility ranged from 10 to 100 percent, with clays and moderate to dense surface cobbles and gravels at
ground surface. Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed that the proposed project area has been
previously impacted by erosion, vegetation clearing and grading, agricultural and residential activity,
livestock activity, two-track roads, fence lines, push piles, utility installations (overhead and subsurface),
residential construction, and impervious cover, such as asphalt and paved areas (Figures 6 and 7).
Archaeologists also observed recent modern debris within some portions of the project area.
Investigations consisted on a visual surface inspection of the wastewater interceptor alignment and pump
station augmented with the excavation of 25 shovel tests (AE01âAE13, CS01â04, and MCC01â08)
(Table 2). Inspection of the proposed pump station pad revealed a great deal of ground disturbance
present (Figure 8). A large subsurface sewer line and a subsurface gas line were marked as running
through the proposed pad boundaries. Further, above ground and subsurface electric utilities, as well as,
what appeared to be a sewage pump station are within the proposed boundaries. The ground surface of the
proposed pad is highly disturbed as well, with recent heavy equipment tracks throughout and active
construction present to the north and to the east. An intensive surface inspection of the area was
conducted augmented by the excavation of four shovel tests (AE10-AE12 and CS01) (see Table 2), with
care taken to avoid buried utilities and obvious surface disturbances. Due to very compact soils, shovel
testing within the areal survey extended to a maximum of 35 cm below the surface (cmbs) and discovered
no subsurface cultural material.
Surface examination of the alignment discovered no prehistoric or historic cultural materials, with the
exception of newly recorded site 41TV2529, an historical artifact scatter within the APE and associated
above-ground built resources (i.e., buildings, standing structures, and/or objects) greater than 45 years in
age immediately east of the APE. Subsurface examination involved the systematic excavation of 21
shovel tests (AE01âAE09 and AE13, CS02-CS04, and MCC01âMCC08) throughout the project area,
with additional efforts focused at site 41TV2529. These excavations exceed the THCâs standards for
shovel testing for projects of this size (see Figure 3; see Table 2). Due to very compact soils consisting of
very dark gray to black blocky clays containing 5 to >20 percent cobbles and gravels, shovel testing only
extended to a maximum of approximately 40 to 50 cmbs and discovered no subsurface cultural materials
(see Table 2). Site 41TV2529 is discussed further below.

SITE 41TV2529
Newly recorded site 41TV2529 is a historic early- to mid-twentieth-century farmstead and associated
artifact scatter identified roughly midway along the project corridor. The site is situated along an upland
ridge sloping down toward the floodplain overlooking Cottonmouth Creek, approximately 50 m due west
along the southwestern terminus of a two-track road oriented roughly northeast to southwest from Colton
Bluff Springs Road (Figure 9). The area mainly consists of undeveloped agricultural land and broad
pastures with tall grasses and short scrub. At the time of the investigations, ground surface visibility
ranged from 30 to 50 percent. Disturbances to the area include erosion, vegetation clearing and grading,
agricultural and residential activity, livestock activity, two-track roads, fence lines, and push piles.
Site 41TV2529 consists of an associated surficial artifact scatter in and around push piles within the APE,
as well as three historic standing structures (HSSs), a well, a cistern, approximately three additional small
sheds, and an associated surface scatter of artifacts surrounding the structures and features outside of the

APE, but in close proximity to the proposed wastewater alignment. One building is depicted on the 1955
Montopolis USGS 7.5-minute topographic map, and the same building (as well as an outbuilding) is on
the 1966 Montopolis USGS 7.5-minute topographic map examined during the historic map review. All of
the structures are oriented northwest to southeast. The structures are in poor condition and significantly
deteriorated with missing portions and walls, as best assessed from the current APE.
HSS 1 is the northernmost structure and consists of a roughly 20- by 20-foot wood frame barn/shed with a
corrugated metal gable and lean-to roof and walls with two large open entries along the southeast
elevation (Figure 10). HSS 2 and HSS 3 are situated side by side in the southern half of the site. HSS 2 is
a roughly 40- by 30-foot wood-frame house/barn with a corrugated metal gable and lean-to roof and walls
constructed of wooden planks with attached corrugated metal patches. There appears to be living quarters
with stairs leading up to a loft in the northwestern front half of the structure and a livestock pen area in
the southeastern back half of the structure (Figures 11 and 12). HSS 3 is the southernmost structure and
consists of a roughly 20- by 30-foot wood frame barn/shed with a corrugated metal roof and northwestern
and southwestern walls constructed of wood planks and corrugated metal (Figure 13). There also appears
to be three additional small sheds further east behind HSS 2. In addition to these structures, there are two
features situated just north of HSS 2 (Figure 14). Feature 1 consists of a circular brick-line well
approximately 3.3 feet in diameter, while Feature 2 consists of a rectangular cistern measuring
approximately 6.5 by 3.5 feet.
SWCA excavated a total of five (5) shovel tests (AE03âAE05 and MCC02âMCC03) at 25-m intervals
within the APE parallel to the HSSs and features outside the APE, all of which were negative for cultural
materials. Shovel tests consistently exhibited compact very dark gray to black blocky clay with gravels
and cobbles (see Table 2).
All observed artifacts were identified along the ground surface within two push piles along the project
corridor, as well as some materials surrounding the structures and features. Observed historic artifacts
within the APE included five to ten amethyst, aqua, and colorless bottle glass fragments; four whiteware
fragments; one blue decorated ceramic fragment; one metal hinge; a few wire cut nails; miscellaneous
metal; three to five light yellowish brown bricks; one grayish brown brick; wood planks; and concrete
fragments in both push piles (Figure 15). Modern debris is strewn throughout the site. The extent of
cultural materials measures approximately 380 feet north to south by 250 feet east to west, with the
boundaries determined by historic-age structures, features, and artifact distribution, although the portion
outside the APE was estimated due to its location beyond project constraints.
Site 41TV2529 is an early- to mid-twentieth-century historic-age farmstead and low-density artifact
scatter situated along an upland ridge overlooking the nearby Cottonmouth Creek. The surficial historic
artifact scatter within the APE lies within a disturbed context due to mechanical clearing and lacks
integrity. Given these conditions, as well as a lack of a subsurface component, SWCA recommends this
portion of the site is not eligible for the NRHP or for designation as an SAL and no further work is
warranted.
The portion of site 41TV2529 containing the structures and features is outside of the APE and has not
been fully evaluated, because it is beyond the current project limits. Therefore, SWCA recommends that
the portion of the site outside of the APE has an undetermined eligibility for the NRHP or for designation
as an SAL and warrants future avoidance. During construction, no vehicles or construction equipment and
materials should be parked or staged outside the proposed wastewater interceptor alignment near the
standing structures to avoid unintentional impacts and encroachment.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
At the request of Brookfield Residential, SWCA performed an intensive cultural resources survey for the
5,376.06-foot-long by 50-foot-wide proposed Cottonmouth Creek Wastewater Interceptor Phases A and
B, as well as 0.7 acre proposed pump station pad in southeastern Travis County, Texas. The project area
is located on lands that will ultimately be owned by a MUD, a political subdivision of the State of Texas.
Investigations were conducted as part of the sponsorâs compliance with the ACT under TAP No. 7856.
Investigations included a background literature review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel
testing of the project area. The background review revealed that five cultural resources surveys have been
conducted near the proposed project area; those various investigations as well as others resulted in the
recording of 11 archaeological sites north and south of Colton Bluff Springs Road within a 1-mile radius
of the APE. Additionally, a review of the TxDOT Historic Overlay maps revealed 36 possible historicage structures within 0.5 mile of the current project area.
Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed primarily agricultural lands with broad pastures on the
gently sloping floodplain and rolling gravelly ridges of Cottonmouth Creek within the upland Blackland
Prairie environment. Previous impacts to the project area include erosion, vegetation clearing and grading,
agricultural and residential activity, livestock activity, two-track roads, fence lines, push piles, utility
installations (overhead and subsurface), residential construction, and impervious cover, such as asphalt
and paved areas. SWCA met the THCâs subsurface testing requirements through an extensive visual
inspection for cultural materials and the excavation of 25 shovel tests throughout the direct APE. Shovel
testing revealed very compact soils consisting of very dark gray to black blocky clays containing 5 to >20
percent cobbles and gravels. Cottonmouth Creek is associated with frequent lateral accretion and erosion
and this, coupled with previous disturbances within the APE, diminished the potential to identify intact
archaeological deposits. During survey investigations, SWCA identified site 41TV2529. The historic
early- to mid-twentieth-century farmstead consists of three historic standing structures, a well, a cistern,
and approximately three additional small sheds situated immediately east of the APE, with an associated
historic artifact scatter along push piles within the APE, as well as some materials surrounding the
structures and features. The buildings appear to be in poor structural condition and significantly
deteriorated, and the surficial artifact scatter is in a disturbed context lacking integrity, due to mechanical
clearing.
In accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith
effort to identify cultural resources properties within the direct APE. Only one newly recorded cultural
resource site (41TV2529) was identified within and immediately adjacent to the APE. The historic artifact
scatter portion of the site within the APE lies within a disturbed context and lacks integrity due to
mechanical clearing. As such, SWCA recommends this portion of the site is not eligible for the NRHP or
for designation as an SAL and no further work is warranted. The portion of the site containing the
structures and features is immediately outside of the APE and has not been fully evaluated, because it is
beyond the current project limits. Therefore, SWCA recommends this portion of the site outside of the
APE has an undetermined eligibility for the NRHP or for designation as an SAL and warrants avoidance.
During construction, no vehicles or construction equipment and materials should be parked or staged
outside the proposed wastewater interceptor alignment near the standing structures to avoid unintentional
impacts and encroachment.
