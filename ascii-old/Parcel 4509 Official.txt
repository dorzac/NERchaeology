Abstract
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) conducted an intensive pedestrian
survey of approximately 0.35 hectare (0.88 acre) of private property known as Parcel 4509 in
Chambers County, Texas. The owner of this property has requested FEMA assistance with
private property debris removal (PPDR).
The Lead Federal Agency for the project is FEMA. The goals of the cultural resources
survey were to determine if the debris removal activities would affect any previously identified
historic properties located on this parcel as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800).
There is a single previously recorded archaeological site located on Parcel 4509. Site
41CH323 was originally identified as a shell midden that contained lithic and ceramic artifacts.
As PPDR is proposed to take place in the immediate vicinity of this site, the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) requested FEMA to conduct limited shovel testing and walkover survey at
this location.
As a result of the investigation, a total of four shovel tests were excavated within the
parcel. While there was evidence of Rangia cuneata shells on the surface, there was no evidence
of cultural material. Based on the lack of diagnostic cultural material present within the site area
and a consistently disturbed and mottled soil profile, FEMA has determined that this site lacks
integrity. Therefore, the proposed PPDR activities on this parcel will not adversely affect this
archaeological site. Work should proceed as planned.

Introduction
On March 17, 2009, FEMA Historic Preservation Specialists performed an intensive
pedestrian survey of a privately owned parcel, Parcel 4509, in Anahuac, Chambers County,
Texas. The landowner has requested FEMA assistance to fund the removal of debris from this
privately owned parcel. The Lead Federal Agency for the project is FEMA. As the survey was
conducted entirely on privately owned property, a Texas Antiquities Permit was not required.
The archaeological Area of Potential Effect (APE) was defined as all 0.36 hectares (0.88 acres)
of property associated with the parcel.
The goal of the cultural resources survey was to determine if activities required to
complete the debris removal would affect previously identified historic properties as defined by
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR
800).

Project Area
Parcel 4509 is located on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Anahuac 7.5Â­
minute topographic quadrangle in Chambers County, Texas. The parcel is located at the end of
Simon Road. It is bounded on the west by Lake Anahuac, and on the south, east, and north by
private residential parcels (Figures 1 and 2). The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for this
undertaking will be the entirety of Parcel 4509, which consists of 0.36 hectares (0.88 acres) of
land.

Natural Setting
Geology and Physiography
Chambers County lies within the Beaumont Formation. The Beaumont Formation
consists of sedimentary beds deposited in the Quaternary Period; these beds are less than two
million years old (Texas Bureau of Economic Geology 1992). The Beaumont Formation itself is
thought to be only 30,000 to 37,000 years old (Aronow 1971). The project parcel is contained
with the coastal prairie physiographic region. The Coastal Prairies are composed of nearly level
strata with a maximum elevation of 300 meters (984.2 feet) (Ibid. 1996). This area is essentially
a massive deltaic plain affected by sea level fall and rise, as well as modern river drainages and
deltas (Aten 1983; 17).

Soils
There are three different soil classifications within the project area. The flood plain of
Lake Anahuac is characterized as Harris Clay (USDA 2006). Harris Clay is a very poorly
drained, very slowly permeable soil found in Gulf Coast marsh and tidal flats. A surface layer of
very dark clay is typically underlain with a subsoil of the same texture mottled with brown clay.
The subsoil is light gray clay with gray and brown mottles. Finally, the substratum is light gray
clay.
The remaining to soil types are Vamont Clays. The sloped banks rising up from Turtle
Bayou are categorized as Vamont Clay (VaB) with 0-5% slopes. This levels off to Vamont Clay
(VaA) with 0-1% slopes. This soil is a somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soil. It
commonly underlies Pine Flatwoods or mixed oak and piney woods. The surface of this soil
type is normally brown clay with red mottles. It is followed by a subsoil of yellowish brown and
light gray clay with red mottles, becoming gray and yellowish brown clay. Lower subsoil layers
are gray clay with red and brown mottles followed by grayish brown, brown, yellowish brown,
and red clay. The USDA soil survey indicates that Vamont soil is prone to rutting and
compaction when the soil is wet, and the high water table inhibits root growth and trees can be
uprooted easily in this soil (USDA 2006).

Hydrology
The project parcel is located within the Lower Trinity River watershed. Specifically, it
lies on the eastern edge of Lake Anahuac, southeast of the mouth of Turtle Bayou. In the 1930s
damming upriver caused the level of Lake Anahuac to rise, submerging large portions of the
original bank line. The western portions of the parcel are located within the floodplain of Lake
Anahuac.

Culture History
The Trinity River Delta is located within the Upper Texas Coast. While some work has
been done within the region (Aten 1983, Ambler 1970, 1973, Shafer 1966), the resulting ceramic
assemblage has not been adequately defined with the context of surrounding cultural regions
such as the Lower Mississippi Valley and Eastern Woodland traditions. Some (Story 1990) see
the assemblage as distinct, while others see influence and dissemination of style from the
surrounding regions (Aten 1983, Shafer 1977).
There has not been a large collection of data from the Archaic Period in southeast Texas.
Several shell midden sites have been identified within the region (Patterson 1980), but have been
difficult to verify and evaluate (Aten 1983; 49). Much of the Archaic Period coastline is
believed to be underwater, preventing archaeologists from examining sites of this period (Aten
1983; 124).
The Ceramic Period began around A.D. 100, but was delayed inland by several centuries
as the technology slowly diffused from coastal areas (Patterson 1995, Aten 1983). Most of the
ceramics of this period were either untempered or grog tempered. Approximately 700 A.D,
further advances in technology can be observed. Sandy paste ceramics and the use of the bow
marked this transition (Ricklis 2004; Strong 1990). In the Galveston Bay area it also
corresponds with the appearance of Baytown Plain ceramics (Aten 1983; 299). Aten created a
chronology of ceramics for this period, consisting of the Clear Lake (A.D. 100-425), Mayes
Island (A.D. 425-650), Turtle Bay (A.D. 650-1000), Round Lake (A.D. 1000-1350), and Old
River (A.D. 1350-1700).
Alternatively, the Mossy Grove Tradition (100-1700 A.D.) was defined as a regional
variation that encompasses the area between the Brazos and the Neches or Sabine Rivers (Story
1990). Cultural material associated with Mossy Grove sites includes Goose Creek Plain
ceramics and limited lithic types.
The French explorers were the first to make contact with local Native Americans in the
Galveston Bay area. In 1721, De Bellisle described encountering a band of about 200 Native
Americans living on the bay. De Bellisleâs counterpart, Du Pratz, described them as Attakapa
(Folmer 1940), but it is generally believed these were in fact Akokisa (Bolton 1913, Morfi 1932,
Aten 1983). The Akokisa were variously described as fishing, gathering eggs, and going inland
to prairies to hunt bison and fight enemies (Folmer 1940). Contact with the Europeans brought
sickness and war and decreased the Akokisa population greatly. While Akokisa were reported to
be living on the mouth of the Trinity River as late as 1830, they are generally believed to have
ceased to exist as a separate group around that time (Padilla 1919). It is believed the remaining
Akokisa were absorbed into the Bidai located to the north of their territories (Dyer 1916,
Berlandier 1905).

Historically, the Town of Anahuac was originally called Perryâs Point, after Henry Perry.
He was a leader of the Gutierrez-Magee expedition in 1815. Perry led a group of 300 soldiers
out of New Orleans with the intention of attacking the Spanish in the Bolivar Peninsula to the
South. He used Anahuac as a winter camp in 1816 and thus the name was established.
Established in 1824, Anahuac became part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas (Rowe 1908:
270). Shortly thereafter in 1825 the Wallis brothers arrived and established Wallisville
northwest of the project parcel. In 1827, John Taylor White arrived at Turtle Bayou and
established one of the first cattle ranches in Texas, where his âwagons bogged down in the rich,
black earthâ (Harry 1939). These families were among the steady influx of Anglos into the
region during the 1820s.
In 1830, the Mexican government under General Manuel de Mier y Teran established a
fort at Anahuac, and began to levy taxes. This move was unpopular with the Anglo settlers, and
Chambers County became the scene of the Anahuac Disturbances of 1832. This began when the
Mexican commander of Fort Anahuac, Lieutenant Colonel Juan Davis Bradburn, arrested
William Travis and Patrick Jack, sent to Anahuac to recover slaves escaped from Louisiana now
in the employment of Bradburn. This act was the tipping point of anger for the local citizenry
against the Centrist Bradburn (Haley 2006). When the Anglo citizenry attempted to retrieve
Travis and Jack from the hands of Bradburn at Anahuac, they were involved in skirmishes with
the Mexican troops and manage to capture Bradburnâs cavalry force on the way there. After
coming to an agreement of exchange of prisoners, they retreated to the crossing of Turtle Bayou
and the farm of John Taylor White. When Bradburn refused to release his prisoners, the Turtle
Bayou Resolutions were drafted at this location. This incident led to the removal of the fort
commander Bradford and the Mexican troops there. This incident is widely considered to be one
of the first acts of the Texas Revolution (Baker 1880).
After Texas independence was established, Anahuac became the focus of another dispute;
this time involving General Thomas Jefferson Chambers and Charles Wilcox. Both claimed
ownership of the town; which Chambers intended to call Chambersea. This was unpopular and
Chambers was assassinated by an unknown assailant in 1865 (Webb and Branda 1952).
Chambers County, named after the recently slain general, was established in 1868 from Liberty
and Jefferson counties.
Oil was discovered regionally in 1935, resulting in a small boom in the local economy.
However, the population of Chambers County has never been high. It has continued to grow
steadily, and currently Anahuac has a recorded population of 2,210 in 2000, while the total for
Chambers County is 28,771.

Previous Investigations
Site file research indicates that there are ten previously recorded archaeological sites
located within 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) of the proposed PPDR location. These sites are listed

Site 41CH323 is located within the boundaries of Parcel 4509. This site was discovered
by C. R. Ebersole and Sheldon Kindall in 1990. It consists of a Rangia cuneata shell (95%) and
Crassostrea virginica shell (5%) midden at the base of the levee ridge along Lake Anahuac.
This site extends beyond the boundary of Parcel 4509 along the flood plain, but it was noted as
being mostly submerged by Ebersole. Ebersole estimated that only 30% of the site remains
intact, and the visible shell on the surface washed in from underwater sections of the site.
A total of two recorded formal surveys have been conducted within 0.8 kilometers (0.5
miles) of the proposed PPDR location. These surveys include a 1976 linear survey conducted by
the EPA-TWDR and a 2008 area survey conducted by GTI Environmental, Inc. Neither of these
surveys documented any new resources (Figure 3).

Research Design and Methodology
Site file research was conducted by consulting on-line research archives maintained by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Research was conducted within a 0.8 kilometer (0.5
mile) study radius of the project parcel to identify all previously recorded archaeological sites,
historical markers and historic structures eligible for National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) listing.
PPDR is proposed to take place on the project parcel. As PPDR activities require the use
of heavy equipment, it is likely that the ground will be disturbed as a result of the debris removal
process. There is a known archaeological site, 41CH323, located on this parcel. The goal of this
survey effort is to determine if the deposits associated with the site retain their integrity, to
determine if culturally diagnostic material is present in subsurface deposits, and to delineate the
site boundaries. The entire project parcel was subjected to intensive pedestrian cultural resources
survey. Archaeological investigations included a combination of surface (pedestrian survey) and
subsurface (shovel testing) testing methods.
The project parcel was surveyed along a series of transects spaced 30 meters (98.4 feet)
apart. Transects in the survey area were surveyed from east to west. Texas minimum survey
standards call for three shovels tests per 0.4 hectares (one acre) in projects less than 0.8 hectares
(two acres) in size. For this survey, a total of six shovel tests were planned for excavation. A 30Â­
meter (98.4-foot) interval was used between each shovel test.
Excavated shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (19.7 inches) in diameter and were
typically excavated into the underlying substratum, or until culturally sterile subsoil was
encountered. Removed soils were screened through 0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth.
Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology and soil color charts.
Additional information concerning soils encountered was recorded on standardized shovel test
forms for each excavation.
Any cultural material recovered during the survey was documented in the field and was
not collected. No cultural material was identified during the course of the current survey effort.

Results of Field Investigations
Parcel 4509 is a heavily eroded and developed parcel. The parcel can be divided into a
lower, floodplain portion and a higher, levee ridge portion. Vegetation on the lower portion of
the parcel consists of cypress trees and moderate understory. This area is subject to flooding and
hydric soils are present within this area. On the levee ridge portion of Parcel 4509, there is a 9.7
by 13.4 meter (32 by 44 foot) wood framed house with attached car port, a driveway, and some
areas of manicured lawn. The driveway is crushed rock and shell, and continues down the
natural slope towards the edge of Lake Anahuac. Large portions of the natural levee ridge have
suffered from slumping and further erosion due to flooding and tree falls. There is a one very
9

large tree that fell and exposed a large root ball located on the levee slope between the house and
the lake. The disturbances associated with the structure and driveway on this parcel leave little
undisturbed, natural ground.
Parcel 4509 showed evidence of large Rangia cuneata shell deposits on the floodplain
portion of the parcel. The shells in these deposits retain much color and vary greatly in size. No
evidence of highly organic midden soil was visible on the surface.
A total of four shovel tests were excavated within the 0.36 hectare (0.88 acre) parcel
(Figure 4). None of these shovel tests were positive for cultural material. Two were located on
the slope rising above the floodplain, and two were located on the top of the slope among the
structures there. Large portions of the parcel were disturbed by structures and associated road,
path, and planters. A large tree was located behind the home on the property. This tree was
felled and exposed a large rootball. This rootball was examined for any evidence of cultural
material; none was encountered. A summary of all shovel test data is presented in Table 2.

Summary and Recommendations
The Rangia cuneata shell observed during pedestrian survey and within the shovel tests
appeared to be natural deposition. The shell showed no signs of age such as loss of color due to
prolonged sun exposure or powdery texture, lacked density in deposition, and appeared to be of
variable age (juvenile and adult specimens). Additionally, no cultural material was encountered
on the surface, in the rootball, or within any of the excavated shovel tests. The soil profile in
each of the shovel tests varied greatly, indicating that the soils in this area have been
substantially disturbed. It is likely that the construction of the house, grading of the
road/driveway, natural erosion processes, and seasonal inundation have resulted in a complete
lack of integrity of this site area.
As no cultural material was encountered and there is no depositional integrity associated
with the 41CH323 site area, FEMA feels that no further investigation is necessary and work
should proceed as planned.

Discussion of Site:
Parcel 4509 is a heavily eroded and developed parcel. The parcel can be divided into a lower, floodplain portion and a
higher, levee ridge portion. Vegetation on the lower portion of the parcel consists of cypress trees and moderate
understory. This area is subject to flooding and hydric soils are present within this area. On the levee ridge portion of
Parcel 4509, there is a 9.7 by 13.4 meter (32 by 44 foot) wood framed house with attached car port, a driveway, and
some areas of manicured lawn. The driveway is crushed rock and shell, and continues down the natural slope
towards the edge of Lake Anahuac. Large portions of the natural levee ridge have suffered from slumping and further
erosion due to flooding and tree falls. There is a one very large tree that fell and exposed a large root ball located on
the levee slope between the house and the lake. The disturbances associated with the structure and driveway on this
parcel leave little undisturbed, natural ground. Parcel 4509 showed evidence of large Rangia cuneata shell deposits
on the floodplain portion of the parcel. The shells in these deposits retain much color and vary greatly in size. No

evidence of highly organic midden soil was visible on the surface. A total of four shovel tests were excavated within the
0.36 hectare (0.88 acre) parcel. None of these shovel tests were positive for cultural material. Two were located on
the slope rising above the floodplain, and two were located on the top of the slope among the structures there. Large
portions of the parcel were disturbed by structures and associated road, path, and planters. A large tree was located
behind the home on the property. This tree was felled and exposed a large rootball. This rootball was examined for
any evidence of cultural material; none was encountered.
