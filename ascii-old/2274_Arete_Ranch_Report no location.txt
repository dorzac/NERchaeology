Lone Mountain principal investigator and field supervisor Douglas Boggess and archaeological technician and GIS specialist Teresa Cordua conducted the fieldwork on March 8, 2017.
The project area is found on the Moser Ranch, TX 1966 7.5' USGS Quadrangle and comprises 71.56 ac (28.96 ha) of private lands in Oldham County, Texas, including Wyndham
Ranch Road and Interstate 40 rights-of-way. The surveyed corridor was 120 ft wide (36.6 m)
and a total of 25,977.6 ft (7,917.9 m) long. The corridor width includes a 20 ft right-of-way
(ROW) with 50-ft cultural buffer on the each side. The work performed within this corridor
consisted of pedestrian survey.

one Mountain Archaeological Services, Inc. conducted an intensive cultural
resource survey of 4.92 miles of proposed overhead power lines. The area of
potential effect of the proposed power lines follows existing county and ranch
roads on private lands belonging to the Arete Ranch in Oldham County Texas. Lone Mountain performed this work at the request of Farmers' Electric Cooperative, with the United
States Department of Agriculture Rural Utilities Service serving as lead agency. This survey
was conducted according to guidelines established in Archaeological Survey Standards for
Texas, published by the Texas Historical Commission.

Lone Mountain performed a files search of the THC Archaeological Site Atlas and the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) to identify all previously recorded sites and surveys within 1 mile of the survey corridor. No previous sites are known within the search
radius. The Site Atlas identifies an archaeological survey of the intersection of Interstate 40
and Wyndham Ranch Road as having taken place under the sponsorship of TXDOT, but provides no other information (Atlas no. 8500009253).
One isolated occurrence was the only cultural resource encountered during this survey, and
has been completely recorded; no further work is deemed necessary. This project will therefore have no effect on any cultural resources.

Farmers' Electric Cooperative proposes to construct overhead power lines in several segments, totaling a
length of 25,977.6 ft on the Arete Ranch. For ease of description, Lone Mountain has numbered these segments 1 through 5 (Figure A.1). All segments have a 20-ft wide right-of-way, and the area of potential effect
for the proposed undertaking is therefore 11.93 ac (4.83 ha).

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area is found on the Moser Ranch, TX 1966 7.5' USGS Quadrangle and comprises 71.56 ac (28.96
ha) of private lands in Oldham County, Texas, including Wyndham Ranch Road (Segment 1) and Interstate 40
rights-of-way (Segments 3 and 4). The surveyed corridor was 120 ft wide (36.6 m) and a total of 25,977.6 ft
(7917.9 m) long. The corridor width includes a 20-ft right-of-way (ROW) with 50-ft cultural buffer on the each
side. The work performed within this corridor consisted of pedestrian survey.

E N V I R O N M E N TA L S E T T I N G
The proposed power line crosses a series of nearly level alluvial fans that drain into Trujillo Creek. Slope varies
in its direction and degree, but overall, the surveyed areas slope gradually to the north or west. Surface visibility varied between 60 percent and 100 percent with vegetation consisting of cholla, yucca, mesquite, prickly
pear, and various forbs and grasses. Elevations range from 3,845 ft to 3,900 ft amsl.

one Mountain Archaeologists Douglas Boggess and Teresa Cordua performed this survey on March 8, 2017.

The project area appears to have been heavily grazed over time, with some wind and water erosion apparent.
All segments surveyed follow existing roads and/or fencelines. The right-of-way of Interstate 40 examined
during the survey of Segments 3 and 4 appears to have been substantially mechanically reworked, with modern roadside refuse drifting onto Arete Ranch lands along the fence. Segment 1 follows Wyndham Ranch
Road, a frequently maintained bladed road that has vestiges of paving in places, while Segments 2 and 5 follow bladed ranch roads. Markers suggest that a pipeline and a buried telephone line are present in Segment 2.
Some roadside refuse of uncertain age is present along Segment 2. An artifact that was clearly more than 50
years old was recorded as an isolated occurrence/occurrence (see below).
Oldham County has a dry steppe climate. The average daily maximum temperature is 89 degrees Fahrenheit
and the average daily minimum temperature is 22 degrees Fahrenheit. The average annual precipitation is
17.75 inches, with most precipitation occurring in the summer (Pringle 1980). Brown (1994) characterizes vegetation in the area as Plains Grassland, consisting of various cacti, mesquite, and dropseed grasses.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
On February 8, 2017, Lone Mountain conducted an online files search of the THC Archaeological Site Atlas to
identify all previously recorded sites and surveys within 1 mile of the surveyed corridors. The only two previously recorded sites listed on the Moser Ranch USGS quadrangle, 41OL320 and 41OL321, are located more
than 1.5 miles to the east-northeast from the closest portion of the surveyed corridors.
The Site Atlas identifies an archaeological survey of the intersection of Interstate 40 and Wyndham Ranch
Road as having taken place under the sponsorship of TXDOT, but provides no other information (Atlas no.
8500009253).

Soils are Quay silty clay loam, 0 to 5 percent slopes; Montoya clay; and Quay-Glenrio-Burson association.
These are found on alluvial fans and slopes, and, in the case of Montoya clay, alluvial flats as well. All three
soils are calcareous loamy alluvium derived from Triassic and Permian age sandstone, siltstone, or shale (https:/

Given the exposed stratigraphy in roadcuts within the survey corridor and high surface visibility, there was no
need for shovel tests during this survey.
ISOLATE DEFINITION
Isolated occurrences are cultural remains that do not qualify as sites. They generally consist of single artifacts or
artifact scatters that are of extremely low density and widely dispersed, and are indicative of a single or unintentional activity. Isolated occurrences are often found in redeposited context and cannot be related to other
nearby sites or isolated occurrences. In addition, isolated occurrences are generally 50 years old or older,
although Lone Mountain may record more recent materials as isolates if there is a sound reason for documenting their presence. Isolated occurrences were recorded in the field on the Lone Mountain isolated occurrence
form, a GPS reading was taken, and their locations were plotted on the USGS quadrangle.
SITE DEFINITION
Sites are defined as any physical location of past human activities or events. Cultural resource sites are
extremely variable in size, and range from a cluster of several objects or materials to structures with associated
objects and features. A site may consist of secondarily deposited cultural resource remains. Features such as
hearths, cairns, rock alignments, masonry concentrations, burned adobe, fire-cracked rock concentrations,
cists, corrals, and rock art are generally recorded as sites. Sites also include definite locations of traditional cultural or religious importance to specified social or cultural groups. Furthermore, sites are at least 50 years old,
unless it can be demonstrated that a property has achieved exceptional importance within the past 50 years
(Criterion Consideration G).

Shovel tests were to be excavated in settings that have potential for buried cultural materials and in places that
have a low surface visibility due to excessive vegetation. According to the survey standards, shovel tests were
to be at least 30 cm in diameter or on a side and excavated to the bottom of Holocene deposits, if possible.
They were to be excavated in levels no thicker than 20 cm, with sediments screened through ¼-inch mesh.

M E T H O D S

This survey was conducted according to guidelines established in Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas,
published by the Texas Historical Commission. Data for this project was gathered employing traditional pedestrian survey methodology. One hundred-percent survey coverage was accomplished by the archaeologists
walking 15-m interval transects. All artifacts identified by the archaeologists were recorded. A photo log was
maintained.

SITE RECORDING
If sites were encountered, boundaries were to be defined according to Texas guidelines. Artifacts and features
were marked and site boundaries were determined by the distribution of these marked cultural materials. Sites
were recorded using a Lone Mountain Site Record form. A sketch map was drawn of each site, and site locations were plotted on the appropriate USGS quadrangle. GPS readings were taken to verify the accuracy of the
field plot and were taken from a datum located on each sketch map. Photographs were taken showing the
setting of each site and any unique or representative features. A representative sample of artifacts from each
site was recorded using Lone Mountain artifact analysis forms. Drawings of diagnostic or representative formal
tools were made. Examinations of rodent burrows, road cuts, drainages, and other disturbed locations were
employed to determine if subsurface cultural deposits were present. Buried charcoal, ash, artifacts, burned
rock, or buried cultural strata constitute subsurface cultural materials.

EVALUATION AND ELIGIBILITY
If encountered, sites were to be further evaluated as to their NRHP eligibility status. The key criterion for most
prehistoric sites is the potential of the site to contain additional data relevant to future research (i.e., NRHP Criterion D). The potential for important additional data is often dependent on the presence or absence of buried
cultural deposits. On each site, the possibility of buried cultural deposits was assessed by a variety of means as
noted above. Observations were noted regarding the likelihood of buried cultural deposits based on several
characteristics. For example, indications of potential site depth include stratigraphic soil profiles exposed along
road cuts and arroyos or cultural materials in the back-dirt piles of rodent burrows.
Partially buried late historic and recent materials observed throughout the project area indicate that eolian processes operate at a rapid pace. In many environments, when the phrase “buried cultural material” is used, the
term “intact” is usually implied. However, in an active dunal environment where burial, deflation, and reburial
of cultural strata may take place over the matter of just a few years, evidence for buried cultural material is not
necessarily evidence for intact buried cultural material. This adds another layer of difficulty to the evaluation of
sites. However, even a deflated site may be considered eligible for nomination to the NRHP, especially if more
than 100 artifacts are present. In the case of historic sites, NRHP Criteria A, B, and C are more likely to be relevant. The relationship between the resources within the project area and the historical context of the project
area were taken into account when evaluating these sites.

L O C AT E D R E S O U R C E S
ISOLATED OCCURRENCE
One isolated occurrence was found in the project area. The locations of the isolated occurrences were
recorded using a Garmin Oregon 650t global positioning system and plotted and listed in Appendix A.
The single isolate is the partially crushed upper end of a steel high-profile cone-top beer can. This type of can
dates between 1937 and the "mid 1950s" (Maxwell 1993:96).

SUMMARY OF CULTURAL RESOURCES AND
MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
The single isolated occurrence encountered during this survey has been completely recorded in a manner consistent with current standards and does not require any additional work.
Clearance for the undertaking is recommended as no cultural resources will be affected. If buried cultural
deposits or other unexpected discoveries are encountered during the project, work should cease immediately,
and the Texas State Historic Office should be notified.
