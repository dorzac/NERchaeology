Archeological Survey

Prime Products Facility Schulenburg

Abstract
The City of Schulenburg (City) will be provided Texas Capital Fund-Revolving Loan Funds
administered by the Texas Department of Agriculture (TDag). The funds will be used to purchase
30 acres for purposes of economic development. Prime Products, a private company, purposes to
purchase the 30-acre tract to construct a new manufacturing and warehouse facility. At the
request of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), the City contracted with Antiquities Planning
and Consulting (APC), Kyle, Texas, to perform a cultural resources survey and to produce a
technical report in conformance with Texas Antiquities Code regulations and Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act.
A records search was performed before the survey and was negative no known or significant
cultural resources are present in or adjacent to the tract. A pedestrian survey was conducted to
inspect the tract. The purpose of the survey was to contribute new knowledge about area cultural
history and to identify any cultural resources present in the 30-acre tract. Systematic pedestrian
survey was used to collect data for analysis and interpretation. The results of the survey were
negative, no new, an/or significant cultural resources were found in the tract
Based on the survey results, it is concluded that no sites eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL) will be affected
by the proposed activity. Therefore, construction should proceed without any additional work.
Lastly, if during construction, archeological deposits are uncovered, work should stop. The THC,
Division of Archeology should be notified by telephone at (512) 463-65090.

PRIME PRODUCTS FACILITY SURVEY
1.0 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC) performed an intensive pedestrian survey of 30 acres
for the City of Schulenburg (City), at the request of the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The
tract will be bought by the City for economic development purposes. The 30-acre tract is situated
in the northeast part of the city near the intersection of US Highway 77 and Interstate Highway
10, where light industrial expansion is underway in a predominantly agricultural area.
Schulenburg is a railroad town that was established in 1873 (Ordintz 2006). It was formed from
established communities, including Lyons begun in 1842 and the High Hill communities of Blum
Hill, Wursten, and Oldenburg, created in 1858 (Chamber of Commerce 2007). The Schulenburg
area is known for its historic German-Czeck painted churches and is on the Texas Pioneer Trail.
The survey results were negative. No cultural resources were found in the tract. Based on
negative results, APC concludes that no cultural resources will be impacted that are eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). APC recommends that construction of
the Prime Product Facility proceed with no additional cultural resources work. However, if any
unexpected archeological deposits are uncovered during construction, work should stop and the
THC, Archeology Division, should be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. Any new finds
should be evaluated by professional archeologists, in consultation with the THC, before
construction activity resumes. A short report of negative findings follows.

2.0 PRIME PRODUCTS FACILITY LOCALE
Schulenburg is located in South Central Texas between San Antonio and Houston (Figure 1). It is
situated in the moderate to humid cultural and ecological zone of the lower Colorado River
valley. The terrain is made up of hilly uplands, and the setting is commercial and light industrial.
The southern boundary of the tract is an oak-lined intermittent stream, while the northern
boundary is near a natural gas line easement.
The parcel is open and undeveloped and bisected east-to-west and north–to-south by intermittent
streams (Figure 2). The tract consists of upland stream terraces bissected by intermittent
drainages that form the headwaters of Black Bayou. Large oaks, elms, and hackberry trees line
the drainages. Sparse grasses, wild flowers, and weeds cover the surface. Man-made channels
have been cut into the south side to improve drainage. The tract has been cleared, leveled, and
artificially terraced, and was formerly plowed (Figure 3).
Soils are mapped by Russell and Brown (1982). Halletsville Fine Sandy Loam lines Black Bayou.
Upland soils include Freisburg Clays 1-3 and 3-5 percent slopes. Dubina Loamy Fine Sand, 2-5
percent slope, is present in the northwest part of the parcel. Halletsville and Freisburg soils were
formed from Tertiary-aged Fleming and Oakville Sandstone Formations, while Late Holocene to
modern–aged alluvium line the banks of the streams.
Prime Products, Inc., plans to construct a new warehouse and manufacturing facility inside the
tract. No construction plans for the facility were available at the time the survey was performed.
The size of the facility is not known. Access and utility easements will be from the south, where
East Avenue will be extended to the north into the parcel. It is presumed that the utilities will
follow the road and will be buried to depths of 3-4 feet deep. The terraced locale is relatively
level, so little cut and fill is anticipated.

3.0 METHODS
The proposed development is located in a region that was settled during Republic of Texas times
and is known to contain historical and archeological sites. The objective of the survey was to
determine if any cultural resources were present inside the proposed development locale that
might be affected by new construction. The goal of the survey was to collected new data that
contributes to the knowledge of locale and regional cultural history. The proposed development is
located on city-owned land. To meet the survey objectives, goals, and THC requirements, APC
performed an intensive pedestrian survey in accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code under
permit number 4565.
Background research was conducted before the survey and included the review of pertinent site
records, maps, indices, and documents from the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State Library (TSL), and APC. The
survey was performed in accordance with Minimum Texas Archeological Survey Standards. The
pedestrian survey consisted of a visual inspection of ca. 30 acres. It was performed by two
technicians on June 11, 2007. Two sets of transects, 30 meters apart, were walked, up and back
down the length of the development area, on both sides of the creeks. Zig-zag and random
transects were walked along the creek banks. Surface visibility ranged form 40 percent to 50
percent. Shovel testing was not implemented because of the high visibility and because the study
area had been subjected to artificial terracing and plowing.
4.0 RESULTS
The results of the survey were negative. No cultural resources were found inside the proposed
development area. Due to the absence of cultural resources, it is judged that the locale is a Low
Probability Area (LPA) for the present of cultural resources. The findings contributed limited new
data about the distribution of cultural resources in the Black Bayou drainage. The lack of cultural
resources correlates to the lack of reliable water sources on upland stream terraces at the
headwaters of drainages.
5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Despite the historic nature of the City of Schulenburg and surrounds, no cultural resources were
found in the 30-acre. The upland tract is a former plowed field located away from reliable sources
of water. Soils in the uplands were formed on Pre-Holocene landforms. All soils in the tract have
been disturbed by leveling, terracing plowing, and channelization. The potential for intact and/or
buried deposits is very low. The tract is, therefore, a Low Probability Area (LPA) for the
presence of cultural resources. APC, based on negative findings, concludes that no cultural
resources eligible for listing in the NRHP and/or as SALs will be affected by the proposed
project. APC, therefore, recommends that construction of the Prime Products Facility in
Schulenburg proceed with no additional work. Lastly, if archeological deposits are exposed
during construction, the THC, Archeology Division, should be notified by telephone at (512) 4636096. The discovery must be evaluated by archeologists in consultation with the THC.
