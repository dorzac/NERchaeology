ABSTRACT
An archaeological evaluation of a proposed 53 mile (96.4 acres) water line in
southeast Wood County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) in February 2003 under Texas Antiquities Permit 3068. This project was
reviewed by the Texas Historical Commission (THC), Archeology Division. Federal
involvement is through the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural
Development. Although the records check at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin revealed several archaeological
sites had been recorded in the vicinity of the project area, no sites were found in the
path of the water line. The vast majority of the water line follows disturbed road rightsof-way. Other reasons for a lack of sites are the presence of clay at or near the surface
along much of the construction corridor. A significant portion of the project area is in
low areas and along the slopes of hills greater than 20 percent. It is recommended that
the Fouke Water Supply Corporation be allowed to proceed with construction with no
further archaeological investigations. Copies of this report are on file at TARL; THC;
Fouke Water Supply Corporation in Mineola, Texas; and BVRA.

INTRODUCTION
BVRA was retained by Fouke Water Supply Corporation (WSC) through NRS
Consulting Engineers of Longview, Texas to conduct a Phase I cultural resources
survey of a proposed water line that will service the residents of rural Wood County
(Figure 1). The majority of the line will be installed along state and county roads; a
small segment will be just across the fence line on private property. The length of the
water line is approximately 53 miles (96.4 acres) and is divided into four categories:
63,786 feet on county or state rights-of-way; 72,036 feet on county or state rights-ofway (replacing existing line); 64,410 feet of new easement on private property; and
51,218 feet of disturbed easement (replacing existing line on private property). The
project area is depicted on six USGS 7.5' topographic maps: Cartwright (1960;
photoinspected 1976), Crow (1960; photorevised 1981), Hainesville (1960; photorevised
1981), Mineola (1960; photorevised 1981), Quitman (1960; photorevised 1980), and
Shady Grove (1960; photorevised 1981). The project area map was taken from a Wood
County Highway Map prepared by the Texas Department of Transportation (Figure 2).
The proposed water line will involve two sizes of pipe: 8" and 12" in diameter.
The 8" line will be placed in a 12" wide trench, and the 12" trench will be placed in a 24"
wide trench. The trenches will be covered with three feet of earth. The permanent
easement will be 15 feet wide with no temporary construction easement.
Overall, Wood County is located in Northeast Texas in the Eastern Planning
Region, an area known to contain significant archaeological sites. Because of this
archaeological potential, a cultural resource study by professional archaeologists was
warranted according to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The
Federal agency involved in this project is the United States Department of Agriculture,
Rural Development office. Since a portion of the project area is within rights-of-way
owned by the State of Texas, an antiquities permit was required, and permit 3068 was
issued to BVRA by the THC. The project number assigned by BVRA is 03-05. The field
survey was conducted on February 26-28, 2003 with William E. Moore assuming the
duties and responsibilities of Principal Investigator.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Wood County is located in Northeast Texas within the Eastern Planning Region
as defined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993). The following comments are taken from
their comprehensive document for this area, and the interested reader is referred to this
volume for more detailed information. As of 1993, Wood County had less than .029
recorded sites per kilometer, ranking it second in the area. The county is described as
rural with 0.15 - 0.29 people per square kilometer and a population growth of less than
5%. Environmentally, it is situated within the Piney Woods, Mixed Pine-Hardwood
Forest area of East Texas. Artificial disturbance in the county consists mainly of lignite
mines from the Deep Basin Wilcox formation and reservoirs such as Lake Fork
Reservoir. In 1991, the county had a total of 184 recorded archaeological sites, of
which 20 were regarded as significant. At the time of this survey, 635 sites were known
to exist in the county (TARL site files). Four sites were listed in the National Register of
Historic Places. The archaeological chronology for the area includes sites dating from
Paleoindian times (9500 B.C. - 7000 B.C.) through the Historic Caddo period that lasted
from A.D. 1680 to A.D. 1860.
One of the major problems regarding our understanding of the archaeology of
Northeast Texas lies in the lack of data for sites with isolable Paleoindian or Archaic
components. "Despite the existence of a potentially rich data base, the body of useful
information on these time periods is small" (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:70). The
authors credit this to the fact that most early materials have been found mixed with later
components. When found, they are difficult to interpret because of limited absolute
dating; poorly defined artifact chronologies; limited preservation of economic data such
as faunal and botanical remains, and the typically low density nature of the cultural
remains. No sites with isolable Paleoindian or Archaic components have been reported
for Wood County as recently as 1993. Sites attributed to the Hunter-Gatherer period
prior to sedentism have been identified in Wood County at 41WD40, 41WD74,
41WD114, and 41WD185). One of the problems with these early sites is that they
usually contain only lithic artifacts; rarely, some sites have yielded hardwood nutshells
and burned rock concentrations. "The scarcity of remains other than lithic artifacts is
due mostly to the relatively great age of these deposits and the poor preservation of
organic remains and nondurable features" (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:75). The
minimum criterion for significance of these sites is the presence of non-artifactual data
such as cultural features and faunal and botanical remains and diagnostic projectile
points that allow confident chronological assessments. Following the hunter gatherer
period (circa 500 B.C.), the emergence of sedentism arrived in Northeast Texas and
lasted until A.D. 1000. Sedentism is defined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993:97) as
"cultural systems where all or part of the population resides at the same location for all
or most of the year." Until recently, very little research had been directed toward the
emergence of sedentism in Northeast Texas. Factors that are believed to have been
causal in terms of this change include population growth, territorial constriction,
environmental change, technological innovation, modifications in social organization,
and/or changes in subsistence strategies (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:97).

4

During this time a major technological innovation, the emergence of pottery and
the bow and arrow, appeared. Sites dating to this period are often referred to as Early
Ceramic. Early Ceramic period components in the Sabine River basin include sites
41WD73 and 41WD495.
The next period is referred to as the development of agriculture in Northeast
Texas before A.D. 1600. Study questions for this period should focus on the processes
that influenced the development of agriculture in Northeast Texas among prehistoric
Caddoan populations with agriculture defined here as a maize-based economy as
described in Fritz (1990). Major sites of this period include Caddoan archaeological
sites, particularly habitation locales with associated burials and burial furniture (usually
pottery). More than 4700 prehistoric archaeological sites have been recorded in both
the Northeast Texas region and adjoining counties where associations exist with the
Caddoan archaeological tradition (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:124).
Approximately 80% of the significant sites in this region are prehistoric Caddoan
sites that were occupied sometime between A.D. 800 and A.D. 1600. These sites
include multiple and single mound centers; cemeteries; habitation sites such as villages,
hamlets, and farmsteads; and possible extractive/processing locations. Most of these
sites, unfortunately, are on private land and are not protected from vandalism. Between
5 and 9 important Formative-Middle Caddoan sites were known to exist in Wood County
as of 1993 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.1). The number of important Late
Caddoan Period sites as of 1993 for Wood County is, however, greater at 11 (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.2). In 1993, 39 Caddoan Period archaeological sites with
excellent faunal and floral preservation were known to exist. Only three are in Wood
County (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.3).
Cemeteries and burial mounds are common throughout Northeast Texas, and
these archeological phenomena are viewed as extremely significant research data sets
because of the bioarchaeological, cultural, and sociopolitical information relevant to the
development of agriculture encoded in the mortuary practices, associated grave goods,
and pathologies/infections preserved in the skeletal remains (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:127). In 1993, 22 archaeological sites in Wood County had produced human
remains (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.5); five single mound sites and one
multiple mound site are recorded in the county (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure
2.5.6).
Fifty-three Critical Resource Zones have been defined in the Northeast Texas
region for sites that are relevant to the research on the development of agriculture prior
to A.D. 1600. Four of these zones are in Wood County (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:Figure 2.5.7). One of these zones is in the north-central portion of the county not
far from the current project area.

The final archaeological period is that of European contact with native Indian
groups, especially the historic Caddo (circa A.D. 1685 - A.D. 1859). The infusion of
material goods and cultural traits brought to the area by the Europeans changed forever
the lifeways of the native Caddoan peoples. At least 89-90 Caddoan sites of this period
are known in Northeast Texas. In Wood County, five sites have produced historic
materials in association with native Indian artifacts (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:154).
These include a European gunflint (41WD74), glass beads and gun parts (41WD217),
glass beads and gun parts (41WD328), glass beads and gun parts (41WD331), and
glass beads, gun parts, kettle fragments, and clasp knives (41WD333). No Critical
Resource Zones have been identified for Historic Contact Period sites in Wood County.
The major historic Indian groups in Wood County in the early 18th Century were
probably the Hasinai and Kadohadacho (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.6.6).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Numerous large-scale reservoir surveys have been conducted in Northeast
Texas. Our knowledge of the prehistory of this area is based largely on the results of
these surveys and subsequent testing and excavation of sites found within their
boundaries. Reservoir studies that involve portions of Wood County Lake Fork
Reservoir to the northwest of the project area and Lake Bob Sandlin to the northeast.
Only a small portion of the latter is in Wood County. Two other reservoir projects were
planned, but the reservoirs were never constructed. These are Big Sandy Lake to the
east of the project area and Mineola Reservoir (Carl Estes Lake) to the west of the
project area. The nearest large-scale project to the current project area was a 1500
acre survey along Mill Race Creek. This drainage is crossed by the construction
corridor associated with this project. The following is a summary of these studies.
In 1971, an archaeological survey of the proposed Mineola Reservoir was
conducted by the Texas Historical Survey Committee and Texas Water Development
Board (Malone 1972). The project area is situated in the upper Sabine River Basin in
the vicinity of the juncture of Rains, Van Zandt, and Wood counties. Only a small
portion of the proposed reservoir area is in Wood County. In all, 91 sites were found
during this project; however, the report does not state how many are in Wood County.
Of particular importance is the settlement pattern data collected during this study. In the
reservoir area, the most obvious and influential factor determining site location is that of
drainages. The researchers at this project found that most sites are situated on
terraces near the edges of the various branches of the Sabine River. The vast majority
of terrace sites were found to be only a few meters from the water source. At the same
time, sites are situated on a landform sufficiently elevated to avoid frequent flooding. In
areas where soils are heavily eroded sites are rare. Some sites lie within the flood plain
proper of the Sabine River being situated on natural levees formed by successive
flooding episodes of the river. Sites in the uplands away from the river are much less
common, especially on hills containing poor soils such as hematite and sand-cemented
uplands. Fifty-five of the 91 sites found had Caddoan occupations, and three also had
earthen mounds.
In 1974, archaeologists from Southern Methodist University surveyed the site of
the proposed Lake Bob Sandlin in Camp, Franklin, Titus, and Wood counties (Sullivan
n.d.). The majority of the project area is in Titus County, and only a small portion is in
the northeastern part of Wood County. In all, 106 sites were found during this project
and range in age from the Archaic to Historic periods. No sites were found in Wood
County. Using information from Lake Monticello and Lake Bob Sandlin excavations, a
settlement model was proposed for the late prehistoric period Caddoan manifestation
known as the Titus Focus. It was proposed that Caddoan hamlets were located along
minor tributaries and that occupation of sites adjacent to Big Cypress Creek was of a
more limited nature.

Lake Fork Reservoir is located in Hopkins, Rains, and Wood counties, with the
majority of the area being in Wood County. Work at this reservoir site began in 1975
with an intensive survey conducted by Southern Methodist University (Bruseth 1975;
Skinner 1975; Bruseth et al. 1977). In all, 130 prehistoric and historic sites were
recorded during the survey, and preliminary testing was conducted at half of the sites.
Based on this work, a mitigation plan was prepared for the prehistoric archaeological
resources of the reservoir and presented to the Sabine River Authority. Sites were
selected for investigation for two reasons. Subsistence settlement models presented in
the survey report were to be tested by work at the sites, and data representative of
presently observable site variability were to be obtained for future researchers (Bruseth
et al. 1977:1). The depth of sites in this area range between 60 and 80 cm through
sandy soil before encountering Pleistocene clay.
In 1976, the mitigation plan was partially implemented when site X41WD19 was
excavated, and sites X41WD16*, X41WD50, X41WD99, and X41WD100 were tested
(Bruseth et al. 1980). The mitigation program was completed in the Reservoir during
the spring of 1978 with work continuing at sites X41WD39, X41WD64/X41WD69,
X41WD83, X41WD87, and X41WD95. In 1979, two additional sites (X41WD108 and
X41WD109) were tested.
Sites tested during the various Lake Fork projects were found to be located on
sandy rises and slopes, terraces projecting into the Lake Fork Creek flood plain, upland
projections into the Burke Creek flood plain, on a terrace surrounded by uplands and a
flood plain, on a large knoll in the Caney Creek flood plain, on a terrace that projects
into the Caney Creek flood plain, on a combined upland remnant, and an alluvial terrace
which projects into the Lake Fork Creek flood plain.
In 1979, Bob D. Skiles, avocational archaeologist, investigated sites along Mill
Race Creek during an archaeological survey of Wood County. The only record of this
project at TARL is a single page site form that includes four sites designated by field
numbers HV 2-5. Later, TARL numbers were matched to the field numbers, and site
numbers 41WD328 - 41WD331 now appear on this site form that has not been updated.
Not one of these sites is in the project area right-of-way.
In 1980, the Sandy Creek basin, in preparation for the Texas Big Sandy Project,
was surveyed by Archaeology, Inc. of Layfaette, Louisiana for the United States Army
Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (Gibson 1982). Thirteen sites were identified
during this study. In 1985, archaeologists from Prewitt and Associates, Inc. conducted
archaeological, geological, and historical investigations at the Texas Big Sandy Project
in Wood and Upshur counties (Perttula et al. 1986). This project was funded by the
Bureau of Reclamation, Southwest Region and cosponsored by the Sabine River
Authority and the Texas Water Development Board. When completed, the reservoir
would flood about 4800 acres on Big Sandy Creek. The archaeological survey involved
2379 acres, and 12 sites were tested by backhoe trench excavations. These sites were
selected because deep, culture-bearing sediments were present. Within the project
area, 63 prehistoric, 12 prehistoric/historic, and 56 historic sites were recorded.

8

The closest major investigation to the current project area was conducted in
1987-1988 when archaeologists from the University of North Texas (Perttula and
Gilmore 1988) examined 1500 acres along Mill Race Creek and some of its tributaries.
The major focus of this study was to evaluate the location of proto-historic and early
historic sites relating to a possible French trading post called Le Dout and the Woldert
site (41WD333) where large numbers of French guns and glass beads have been found
since the 1870s. Although no specific archaeological sites were found in the project
area that appear to be French trading posts, a number of 18th century localities were
recorded and collections studied. Other sources for information concerning this site
include Woldert (1952), (Moody 1969), and newspaper articles in the Wood County
Democrat (August 6, 1908) and the Mineola Monitor (1946). In all, 39 sites and 32
localities were found during the week-long survey. Twenty-one sites in the project area
are considered by the researchers to be potentially eligible to the National Register of
Historic Places or as State Archeological Landmarks. Not one of these sites is in the
project area right-of-way.
The interested reader is referred to the reports mentioned above, especially the
Texas Big Sandy Project by Gibson (1982). This document presents a very thorough
discussion of earlier work in Wood County and Northeast Texas.

University.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field a records check for previously recorded sites in or near
the project area was conducted by Allegra Azulay at TARL, in Austin, Texas, the state
repository for site records. Archaeological sites found to be within or near the
construction corridor were plotted on project maps for use in the field. These sites
appear on the topographic maps as Appendix I to this report. In addition, relevant
reports were checked in order to become familiar with the kinds of sites found in the
area.
Prior to conducting subsurface testing, the Project Archaeologist drove the entire
line with the water supply corporation Manager who pointed out where the line would be
installed as well as any known disturbances along the way. This was necessary since
the new right-of-way was not staked. Access to private property was arranged by the
water supply corporation who had obtained permission from the various landowners
prior to the beginning of this survey. During the survey, the field crew took
measurements on private property to make sure no subsurface excavation was
conducted outside the project area right-of-way. In addition, a "dig test" (a term used by
utility companies to refer to the location of buried utility lines) was requested by Fouke
WSC so the field crew would be able to dig safely and avoid encountering buried
utilities. A check of the topographic maps indicated that no dedicated historic
cemeteries would be affected by the planned water line. The project area, as depicted
on the six topographic maps, appears in this report as Appendix II.
The field crew drove the entire water line. All high probability areas were
surveyed on foot and evaluated for the presence of significant archaeological sites. In
addition, road cutbanks were examined for cultural materials. In many cases, the profile
of the landform revealing the sandy soil above the red clay was clearly visible.
Much of the construction corridor is situated in low areas containing standing
water or on steep slopes greater than 20 percent. Shovel testing was not considered
necessary in these areas. In other areas, the water line will be placed in existing borrow
ditches that have been disturbed to the point that the topsoil has been removed. The
numerous high hills adjacent to creek crossings were often cut away to make room for
the road, as much as 30 feet in some instances. In these cases, it was not uncommon
for the construction corridor to be within the subsoil. The field survey crew identified 23
areas where soil was present. These areas were shovel tested. These areas, indicated
by the approximate location of the 73 shovel tests are depicted on the project area
maps (Appendix II).
In a linear project such as this one, previously recorded sites are sometimes
located within the right-of-way or in close proximity. Although some archaeological sites
are on landforms crossed by the proposed construction corridor, not one of these sites
is actually within the right-of-way according to map plottings at TARL. Shovel tests or
probes were excavated at every location in the vicinity of a previously recorded site.

10

The survey standards published by the THC, recommend that 16 shovel tests per
mile in undisturbed areas with soil development be excavated. After eliminating
disturbed areas, areas with standing water, and slopes greater than twenty percent, 23
areas were determined suitable for subsurface investigation. In all, 73 shovel tests
were dug in these areas (Appendix II). When possible, these tests were terminated
when Pleistocene clay was encountered. All earth excavated through shovel testing
was screened using 1/4" hardware cloth, and a shovel test log (Appendix III) was kept.
It should be noted that, in addition to shovel tests, probes were dug with a shovel to
identify shallow soils in some areas. In some areas clay was found to be as shallow as
10 cm. These probes were not screened, numbered, or depicted on the field maps.
Floodplain areas were shovel tested in order to ascertain if backhoe trenching
would be necessary. Most of the flood plains contain Pleistocene clay at or near the
surface. Three flood plain or overflow areas were tested with a backhoe. The trenches
were four meters in length, 1 meter in width, and dug to Pleistocene clay. The backhoe
trenches are depicted on the topographic maps (Appendix II), and the profiles are
illustrated in Appendix IV.
As part of the field notebook, sketch maps depicting shovel test locations were
drawn. Profiles of all shovel tests were drawn in the field; and these profiles illustrate
the varying depths of soil throughout the project area.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Records Check
A check of site records at TARL revealed six individual archaeological sites on
landforms crossed by the construction corridor or in close proximity to the project area.
These are 41WD30, 41WD80, 41WD241, 41WD338, 41WD410, and 41WD561. Not
one of these sites, however, is actually within the project area right-of-way. Also, there
is a cluster of at least 10 sites along Mill Race Creek, a major stream in the project area.
The site numbers on the TARL maps are difficult to read; however, it is clear that site
41WD333, located in the flood plain, is the closest site to the construction corridor.
According to Timothy K. Perttula (personal communication to William E. Moore, April 7,
2003), this potentially significant site (see Previous Investigations above) is clearly
outside the right-of-way; therefore, no detailed discussion of this site in this section is
warranted. All of the sites near the project area are depicted on the topographic maps
in Appendix I. Although these sites will not be affected by the proposed construction,
brief summaries are presented below.
Site 41WD30 is a prehistoric site recorded by Timothy K. Perttula based on
plottings by Bob Skiles. It is approximately 800 meters southwest of Lake Lydia on F.M.
778. Although it is on the same landform that is crossed by the construction corridor, it
is plotted on the topographic map as approximately 100 meters from the road. If plotted
correctly, this site is outside the project area, and no evidence of this site was found
during shovel testing. No site form is on file at TARL. This site is depicted on the
Quitman quadrangle.
Site 41WD80 is a historic farmhouse located on State Highway 14 recorded by
Jon Gibson in 1980 during a survey by Archaeology, Inc. and determined not to be
significant. This site on the opposite side of the road from the construction corridor. It is
depicted on the Shady Grove quadrangle.
Site 41WD241 is a prehistoric site recorded by Timothy K. Perttula based on
plottings by Bob Skiles. It is approximately 750 meters southwest of Lake Lydia on
Farm-to-Market Road 778, and it is on the same landform that is crossed by the
construction corridor. No site form is on file at TARL. This site is depicted on the
Quitman quadrangle.
Site 41WD338 is an archaeological site recorded by Timothy K. Perttula on the
same landform that is crossed by the construction corridor but on the opposite side of
the road. It is southeast of Mill Race Creek on a hill overlooking a tributary of Jones
Branch. This site is depicted on the Hainesville quadrangle. This site was recorded
during the Big Sandy Lake project in the 1980s. There is no site form, and it is not
known if this is a prehistoric or historic site.

12

Site 41WD410 is a prehistoric site recorded by Timothy K. Perttula based on
plottings by Bob Skiles. It is approximately 850 meters southwest of Lake Lydia on
Farm-to-Market Road 778, and it is on the same landform that is crossed by the
construction corridor and the same side of the road. No site form is on file at TARL.
This site is depicted on the Quitman quadrangle.
Site 41WD561 is a prehistoric site recorded Timothy K. Perttula in 1987 during a
survey by North Texas State University. It is just south of the community of Hainesville
on Farm-to-Market Road 778, and it is on a landform overlooking Patton Creek to the
southeast and on the opposite side of the road as the construction corridor. The TARL
plotting puts this site on the opposite side of the road from the planned water line.
According to the site card on file at TARL, this site is located in the front yard of the
David T. Lindley residence. Perttula states that the site was not thoroughly tested
because of the condition of the yard and gardens. Therefore, he concludes that parts of
the site remain undisturbed between the road, garden and house. The depth of cultural
deposits are about 20 cm. This site is depicted on the Hainesville quadrangle.
The largest cluster of sites (n=10) is along Mill Race Creek where it crosses
Farm-to-Market Road. These sites are 41WD327, 41WD328, 41WD329, 41WD333,
41WD562, 41WD565, 41WD567, 41WD568, 41WD569, and 41WD570. Unfortunately,
there is no site form for the potentially significant site 41WD333 and no current forms for
some of the other sites on file at TARL. Although the presence of this cluster of sites
suggests this stream was a preferred area for prehistoric sites, not one of the sites is
within the construction corridor. The closest boundary of the nearest site (41WD333) is
depicted on the topographic quadrangle as at least 50 meters distant. These sites are
depicted on the Hainesville quadrangle.
Field Survey
As stated above, shovel tests and or probes were excavated on all landforms
containing nearby previously recorded sites. These tests confirmed the TARL map
plottings that all of these sites are outside the project area, sometimes as much as 200
meters distant. No previously unrecorded archaeological sites were found to exist
within the construction corridor as currently planned. Several historic sites were
observed, but they were outside the project area as well. Although it is known that
Wood County contains numerous significant prehistoric sites, the construction corridor
either passed through low probability areas or was disturbed to the point that any intact
archaeological sites would not be present today. As mentioned above, many of the high
hills had been cut away to allow for a more desirable road grade (Figure 3). This
practice removed all of the topsoil over much of the project area with the road (and
construction corridor) now within the subsoil.

Figure 3. Typical Profile of Road Cut
Previously Recorded Sites:
Site 41WD30 at 200 meters from the construction corridor was determined to be
too far from the project area. In this area the water line will be installed in a disturbed
borrow ditch.
Site 41WD80 is located in an area that has been cut away for road construction.
The current road is located within the subsoil, all of the topsoil having been removed
during road construction.
Site 41WD241 is across the highway from the construction corridor. At this
location the construction corridor will be installed in a disturbed borrow ditch.
Site 41WD338 is depicted on the topographic quadrangle as across the highway
from the construction corridor. Three shovel tests were dug on this landform, and no
evidence of a prehistoric site was found. The tests were dug through tan sand until red
clay was reached at 40 cm.
Site 41WD410 is depicted on the topographic quadrangle as within the
construction corridor. Five shovel tests were excavated in the construction corridor, and
no evidence of a prehistoric site was found. The tests were dug through tan clayey
sand until clay was encountered between 50 and 60 cm.
Site 41WD561 is depicted on the topographic quadrangle as across the highway
from the construction corridor. Two shovel tests were dug on this landform, and no
evidence of a prehistoric site was found. The tests were dug through tan fine sandy
loam to 80 and 90 cm.

The large cluster of sites along Mill Race Creek where it crosses Farm-to-Market
Road 778 are outside of the project area corridor and are located on both sides of the
highway. The closest site in this cluster to the proposed right-of-way is 41WD333. This
site is depicted on the topographic map as being located in the flood plain of Mill Race
Creek on the south side. Three shovel tests were dug in the flood plain within the
highway right-of-way. The site is located several hundred meters to the west on private
property. Therefore, it is not affected by utilities or proposed construction. No evidence
of a prehistoric site was found in the shovel tests. The tests were dug through red clay
to 10 cm.
The two closest sites to the project area are 41WD338 and 41WD410. As stated
above these sites are well outside the proposed right-of-way. Shovel testing on these
landforms did not encounter any evidence of these sites. Shovel tests were excavated
in the highway right-of-way between the road and the fence line delineating private
property. No utilities were in the path of the proposed right-of-way.
It is evident from the literature search that numerous potentially significant sites
are present in Wood County. Unfortunately, many of the sites in the vicinity of the
project area lack site forms at TARL making analysis of them in this report impossible.
The majority of the project area is located in an upland setting where significant
prehistoric sites are less likely to occur. Since most of the proposed water line right-ofway will be in a disturbed borrow ditch, there were few areas worthy of shovel testing.
State Highway 14, for example, covers about 10 miles between Pine Mills and the
termination of the proposed water line just above the community of Hawkins. This 10
mile segment follows an upland ridge with only one area suitable for shovel testing.
Most of the hills in this area were cut away in order to create a less steep road grade.
Figure 3 was drawn along this highway. Because researchers did not venture from the
"Area of Potential Effect," there was little opportunity for finding intact archaeological
sites.
It should be stated here that there is a number of archaeological sites in Wood
County plotted on topographic maps at TARL with no additional information. Some of
these sites were recorded by an avocational archaeologist who did not complete
individual site forms or write a report. Other sites simply lack site forms. When the
topographic maps are reviewed as part of the records search prior to the field survey, a
completely different picture of the probability for archaeological sites within the project
area is presented. Numerous locations within the proposed water line right-of-way
appear to be very high probability areas for significant sites. This is based on the
landforms as depicted on the maps and the apparent high density of recorded sites in
similar settings. However, the field survey revealed a much different picture. Many of
the promising landforms have been cut away for road construction leaving relatively few
areas suitable for shovel testing and/or backhoe trenching. While this area of Wood
County is believed to be a good area for archaeological sites, the route of the water line
as currently planned does not pass through any sites.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found within the construction corridor as currently
planned. It is, therefore, recommended that Fouke WSC be allowed to proceed with
construction with no additional archaeological investigations. It is always possible that
areas containing cultural resources are missed during any archaeological survey.
Should any evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during construction of
the proposed water line, work in that area should be halted until the situation can be
evaluated by the THC in consultation with BVRA and Fouke WSC.
