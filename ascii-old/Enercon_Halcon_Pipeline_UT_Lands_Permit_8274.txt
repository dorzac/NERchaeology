ABSTRACT

Enercon Services, Inc. (ENERCON), in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey for the proposed Halcon Pipeline. The proposed pipeline is approximately 43.3
miles (69.7 km) in length and located near Pecos, Texas in Ward and Reeves counties. This report
encompasses only the portion of the proposed Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas lands in Ward
County, Texas. The University of Texas is a political subdivision of the State of Texas. The portion of the
Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas lands is approximately 7.35 miles (11.83 km) in length and is
depicted on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Pyote West, Tex. (1969, Photorevised 1981), 7.5
Minute Quadrangle. The construction corridor consists of a 50 feet (15 m) wide permanent pipeline rightof-way (ROW) and a 50 feet (15 m) wide temporary workspace corridor. An additional temporary
workspace which measures 200 by 200 feet (61 by 61 m) wide occurs at a bore location on the north side
of the Interstate Highway 20 crossing. The cultural resources survey area of potential effect (APE) consists
of the 7.35 miles (11.83 km) long by 100 foot (30 m) wide survey corridor and the additional workspace
block area north of Interstate Highway 20, totaling 90.01 acres (36.43 hectares).
The cultural resources investigation is intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 Antiquities Code of Texas
and the cultural resources survey on University of Texas lands was completed under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 8274. All aspects of the project were supervised by Michael M. Margolis, an ENERCON
archeologist who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for
archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61.
Prior to the survey, a search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas) was conducted by Michael
M. Margolis to locate previously recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) properties, and State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Based on the Atlas, two
archeological sites, 41WD11 and 41WD12, have been recorded within 1-mile of the APE. Neither site is
located closer than 1,300 feet (400 m) from the APE and neither site will be impacted by construction of
the proposed Halcon Pipeline. Based on the Atlas, two archeological surveys or studies are mapped within
1-mile of the APE on University of Texas lands.
The cultural resources survey of the Halcon Pipeline APE on University of Texas lands was conducted
December 5-7, 2017 by Julie Wasinger and Gary D. Edington, ENERCON archeologists who meet the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61.
Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) Archeological
Survey Standards for Texas.
The cultural resources survey of the proposed Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas lands resulted in the
observation of one isolated find (IF). IF#1 consists of a non-diagnostic projectile point/knife (PPK)
fragment observed on the surface 34 feet northwest of the centerline in the margin of an existing pipeline
ROW. Ground surface visibility at the location of IF#1 was over 80 percent. A pedestrian survey grid at 35 meter intervals was conducted at the location of IF#1 and two shovel tests excavated in the vicinity failed
to identify any additional cultural materials. IF#1 lacks additional information potential and is therefore not
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or SAL listings, and no further work is recommended at the location of
IF#1.
The cultural resources survey of the Halcon Pipeline APE did not result in finding any additional historic
or prehistoric artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or sites and no artifacts were collected on University of
Texas lands. Therefore, it is recommended that construction of the proposed Halcon Pipeline on University
of Texas lands will have no effect on any historic property that may qualify for inclusion on the NRHP or
SAL listings. No further cultural resources investigations are recommended prior to construction of the

features, or artifacts that are 50 years old or older are encountered within the APE during construction of
the Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas lands, work in the area must cease and the regional THC
Archeologist must be notified immediately.

INTRODUCTION

Enercon Services, Inc. (ENERCON), in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey for the proposed Halcon Pipeline. The proposed pipeline is approximately 43.3
miles (69.7 km) in length and located near Pecos, Texas in Ward and Reeves counties (Figure 1). This
report encompasses only the portion of the proposed Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas lands in Ward
County, Texas. The University of Texas is a political subdivision of the State of Texas. The portion of the
Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas lands is approximately 7.35 miles (11.83 km) in length and is
depicted on the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Pyote West, Tex. (1969, Photorevised 1981), 7.5
Minute Quadrangle (Figures 2.1-2.3). The construction corridor consists of a 50 feet (15 m) wide permanent
pipeline right-of-way (ROW) and a 50 feet (15 m) wide temporary workspace corridor. An additional
temporary workspace which measures 200 by 200 feet (61 by 61 m) wide occurs at a bore location on the
north side of the Interstate Highway 20 crossing. The cultural resources survey area of potential effect
(APE) consists of the 7.35 miles (11.83 km) long by 100 foot (30 m) wide survey corridor and the additional
workspace block area north of Interstate Highway 20, totaling 90.01 acres (36.43 hectares).
Construction of the Halcon Pipeline will involve the mechanized clearing of vegetation within the APE and
open-cut trenching where the pipeline will be buried. Clearing of vegetation is typically done with
bulldozers. The trenches are typically four to six feet (1.2 to 1.8 m) deep and three to four feet (0.9 to 1.2
m) wide and dug by excavators. Interstate, State, County, and private roads, including lease roads, are
typically bored by horizonal directional drilling (HDD). Additional impacts within the APE include foot
traffic and general vehicle traffic ranging from light-duty pickup trucks to heavy mechanized equipment.
Interstate Highway 20 will be bored by HDD with an expanded drill entry pad measuring 200 by 200 feet
(61 by 61 m). Once construction is complete and the pipeline is operational, all trenches and pits will be
backfilled, and all construction equipment will be removed.
The cultural resources investigation is intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 Antiquities Code of Texas
and the cultural resources survey on University of Texas lands was completed under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 8274. All aspects of the project were supervised by Michael M. Margolis, an ENERCON
archeologist who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for
archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61. No artifacts were collected during the survey. Pursuant to 13 TAC
26.17, notes, records, photographs, and photograph logs generated during the survey have been prepared
for permanent curation at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.
Prior to the survey, a search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (the Atlas) was conducted by Michael
M. Margolis to locate previously recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) properties, and State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Based on the Atlas, two
archeological sites, 41WD11 and 41WD12, have been recorded within 1-mile of the APE. Neither site is
located closer than 1,300 feet (400 m) from the APE and neither site will be impacted by construction of
the proposed Halcon Pipeline. Based on the Atlas, two archeological surveys or studies are mapped within
1-mile of the APE on University of Texas lands.
The cultural resources survey of the Halcon Pipeline APE on University of Texas lands was conducted
December 5-7, 2017 by Julie Wasinger and Gary D. Edington, ENERCON archeologists who meet the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61.
Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) Archeological
Survey Standards for Texas.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

The APE on University of Texas lands is situated within the Chihuahuan Basin and Playas biotic province
of the Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007). The Chihuahuan Basins and Playas are part of
the larger Chihuahuan Deserts which extend from the Madrean Archipelago of Arizona in the west to the
Edwards Plateau of central Texas. The boundaries of this area are defined by an arid climate with some of
the lowest precipitation rates in Texas, which support desert shrub vegetation dominated by creosote bush
and honey mesquite on the alkaline or gypsiferous soils (Griffith et al. 2007). The elevation of the
Chihuahuan Basins and Playas range from 1,200 to 4,500 feet above mean sea level (amsl) with local relief
varying from 25 to 500 feet (Griffith et al. 2007:10). The major drainages of the approximately 12,625
square mile ecoregion are the Pecos River which carries runoff from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in
northern New Mexico and the Rio Grande which carries runoff from the San Juan Mountains in southern
Colorado (Griffith et al. 2007:8-9). Otherwise, the ecoregion is primarily internally drained, resulting in
alkaline soils, but an efficient recharge rate of local aquifers.
The presence of the quality groundwater did not go unnoticed by settlers and early 20th century inhabitants
who made use of the abundant ground water with irrigation well with flow rates between several hundred
to 2000 gallons per minute (Griffith et al. 2007:9). Prehistoric and protohistoric populations also made use
of irrigation in the region (Long 2010, Dethloff and Nall 2010). The ranching and irrigation based
agricultural practices developed from the late 19th to 20th century in the region have altered the native
environment. The primary crops on these irrigated agricultural fields have included cotton, pecans, alfalfa,
tomatoes, onions, chili peppers, and the famous melons, particularly cantaloupe from Reeves County
(Griffith el al. 2007; Geiser 2010). The ranching and irrigation based agricultural practices developed from
the late 19th to 20th century in the region have altered the native environment. In the El Paso area and to the
west, aquifer drawdown has led to over a 100 foot decline in ground water levels from those recorded at
the turn of the 20th century and salt build up in soils has led to the abandonment of many Pecos River Valley
agricultural fields which were previously productive farmlands in the 1900s (Griffith et al. 2007:9). Early
settlers and observers described the river as generally 4 to 15 feet deep and up to 100 feet wide with a fast
current and fordable in only a few places (Griffith et al. 2007:9; Hayter 2010). The agricultural and
industrial uses of the Pecos River in New Mexico and Texas have drastically reduced water levels,

transforming the Pecos into a gentle, slow river with a shallow, narrow channel. As an example, the early
history of settlement in the region of modern Pecos, Texas was related to the encampments of cowboys in
the region due to the safe ford for cattle across the mighty Pecos River to the east of the modern town site
(Hayter 2010). The historic to modern grazing practices have also altered the environment in the region.
The former grasslands which supported cattle have been reduced by overgrazing to dessert shrub lands
mostly suitable for only sheep and goats (Griffith et al. 2007:8).
The arid climate of the APE results in relatively sparse vegetation and excellent GSV. The dominant
creosote bush is an example of the resilient regional flora which can tolerate the diurnal temperature range,
low moisture conditions, and high evapotranspiration rates of the region. Additional ecotones include the
high saline environments of the playas where saltbush and alkali sacaton may be found along the margins
of these dry saltpans and playas (Griffith et al. 2007:8). Honey mesquite, yucca, and mixed grasses are
found intermittently in the region.
The elevation of the APE on University of Texas lands ranges from approximately 2,674 to 2,612 feet (815
to 796 m) amsl. The highest point within the APE on University of Texas lands is at the northern edge of
the University of Texas property (Figure 2.1). The lowest point within the APE on University of Texas
lands is at the southern edge of the University of Texas property, adjacent to Interstate Highway 20 (Figure
2.3). All of the 7.35 miles (11.83 km) long APE on University of Texas lands drains internally into a basin
south of Interstate Highway 20. The APE on University of Texas lands is underlain by Holocene sand sheet
deposits composed of large areas of windblown sand dunes (Barnes et al. 1992). A short, approximately
2,865 foot (873 m) portion of the APE on University of Texas lands south of Farm Road 2355 is underlain
by exposed Pleistocene and Holocene caliche deposits (Barnes et al. 1992).
According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), the APE on University of Texas lands
crosses six mapped soil units which presented alphabetically in Table 1. The Sharvana soils are farmland
of statewide importance. However, the remaining five soils are not considered prime farmland primarily
due to salinity, gravel content, and/or depth to bedrock (USDA 2017). The majority of soils consist of
gravelly loam derived from decomposed limestone. Multiple soils also contain significant amounts of
calcium carbonate (caliche). The gravelly, rich in caliche, and/or shallow soil units are unlikely to contain
buried cultural deposits.

Ward County has a subtropical-semi desert climate with relatively short mild winters and long hot summers.
January is the coldest month with daytime highs near 61° Fahrenheit (°F) and lows at or below 32°F two
out of three nights in January. July is the hottest month, with daytime highs near 97°F and nighttime lows
near 70°F. High temperatures above 100°F are common. Annual rainfall averages 12 inches (30 cm), with
approximately 75% of rainfall occurring from May through October, in brief heavy thunderstorms. The
remaining 25% of rainfall occurs from November through April. Annual snowfall greater than one inch
(three cm) is rare and snow rarely remains on the ground more than a few hours. Dust storms are common
in late winter and early spring. The growing season averages 223 days, and the average date of the last
freeze is April 1 and the average date of the first freeze is November 10. Average annual relative daily
humidity reaches a high of 65 percent at 6am, drops throughout the day and reaches a low of 35 percent by
6pm (Orton 1975).

ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

Based on the archeological record, people have inhabited the region for the last 12,000 years. The
archeological chronology has commonly been broken into five temporal periods. The dates assigned to
those periods differ between authors but generally include the Paleoindian Period (ca. 10,000 to 6,000 B.C.),
Archaic Period (ca. 6,000 B.C. to A.D. 500), Late Prehistoric Period (ca. A.D. 500 to 1500), Protohistoric
Period (ca. A.D. 1500 to 1700), and Historic Period (ca. A.D. 1700 to 1950) (adapted from Boyd 2004,
Perttula 2004, and Raily 2016:54). A summary of the culture history of the region is presented below. For
additional information on the cultural history of the region and a more detailed review, the reader is directed
to the works by Perttula (2004), Railey (2013, 2016), and Turner, Hester, and McReynolds (2011).
Paleoindian Period
Evidence for prehistoric occupation of the area is relatively scarce in the Paleoindian Period (ca. 10,000 to
6,000 B.C.). It is probable that earlier sites have been lost to erosion due to the geological context of the
area (Boyd 1997:7). Paleoindian sites are more common and more reliably dated on the eastern Edwards
Plateau and southern High Plains, although sites and isolated artifacts have been recorded. Although there
is growing evidence for an earlier human presence in the Americas, Clovis is the first well-defined cultural
horizon in the region. The remains of large herbivores are found in association with Clovis artifacts but
there is more recent research supporting the procurement of smaller animals and plants during this time.
The Clovis projectile points are lanceolate in shape and have fluted bases. Subsequent Paleoindian projectile
points include Folsom and Plainview (Turner, Hester, and McReynolds 2011:45). These projectile points
were typically hafted to spears, which were often thrown with the aid of atlatls.
Archaic Period
With the extinction of megafauna, the Archaic Period (ca. 6,000 B.C. to A.D. 500) is generally defined by
broader subsistence practices and an increase in intensity of resource exploitation. The climate transitioned
from the dryer Altithermal in the Early Archaic through the Late Holocene Wet Period to the relatively dry
Late Archaic Medieval Period (Railey 2016:59-83). Additionally, temperatures appear to have increased
which resulted in changes to the biotic community and the subsequent subsistence strategies of the Archaic
Period populations of the region. Fire cracked rock and oxidized rock is relatively common during this
period and likely results from hearths and ovens. Although resource exploitation is inferred to be more
intense, subsistence appears to be focused on seasonal mobility tied in part to bison hunting (Boyd 1997).
Campsites and rock shelters have been identified from this period, mostly from the Late Archaic. Projectile
points are normally barbed spear or dart points, and plant-processing tools increase through time (Johnson
and Holliday 2004). There is an increase in the number of recorded sites in the region attributed to the Late

Cultural Resources Report: Proposed Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas Lands

Page 8

Archaic in terms of both diagnostic points and radiocarbon dates (Railey 2016:75, 86). The overall inference
is an increase in the population of the region during the Late Archaic (Railey 2016:75).
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric or Ceramic Period (ca. A.D. 500 to 1500) is marked by the presence of ceramics and
smaller projectile points indicating the switch from atlatl and spear to the bow and arrow (Johnson and
Holliday 2004). This period is also known as the Formative Period in the nearby western Trans-Pecos
because of the region’s inclusion within the Jornada Mogollon cultural area of the greater Southwest
archeological region (Railey 2016: 9). Due to further drying of the climate, a reduction of bison numbers is
hypothesized for the region. Trading is inferred to have occurred with Southwestern groups including the
Jornada Mogollon (Boyd 1997). Brownware pottery was imported from the Puebloans and habitation
structures from this period include pit houses. Campsites were still likely used during parts of the year and
would be representative of seasonal mobility. Subsistence practices in the Southern High Plains of the Texas
Panhandle to the northeast included the introduction of maize by A.D. 1000 (Drass 2008), and maize has
been found in caves to the west in the Guadalupe Mountains, and to the south on the Marfa Plain (Railey
2016:99-101, 132). However, the region continued to be dominated by mobile hunter-gatherers (Railey
2016:132), and regional subsistence in Ward County does not include evidence of cultivated resources
(Railey 2016: 99-101, 132). In the latter part of the period, prestige goods like Olivella shell beads,
turquoise, non-local pottery, and obsidian become more common.
Protohistoric Period
The Protohistoric Period (ca. A.D. 1500 to 1700) begins with direct and indirect European influences in the
region. This period is also known as the Post-Formative or Post-Pueblo Period in the nearby western TransPecos and New Mexico (Railey 2016:134-140). European settlement did not begin to seriously disrupt
aboriginal habitation until after A.D. 1700. European diseases, probably introduced by explorers and early
traders, did have impacts as early as A.D. 1528. At least 30 epidemics were recorded among Texas tribes
between A.D. 1528 and 1890 (Ewers 1974). Further to the west in the project region Railey defines this era
as the Post-Formative Native Americans (After A.D. 1450). There is widespread abandonment of the
villages and associated lifestyle on the southern High Plains, the Jornada Mogollon and even the Casa
Grandes Region (Railey 2016:134). There is limited evidence of sites dating to the Post Formative Period
in the study region and in Southeast New Mexico (Railey 2016:137). With the abandonment of the village
lifeway, the nomadic bison hunters either did not leave a record that is temporally recognizable via
radiocarbon dating, or material culture that can only be attributed to this era. Railey refers to this as a ‘low
archaeological visibility” problem for sites from the Post-Formative Period (2016:140). Whether
populations totally abandoned the region remains unclear.
Historic Period (A.D. 1700 to 1950)
Spanish explorers began expeditions in the Gulf of Mexico beginning in the early 1500s followed by
Catholic missionaries accompanied by Spanish soldiers. The Spanish, while teaching locals Christianity
and farming, attempted to make loyal Spanish citizens. The first missions were established in Mexico, but
were later built in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas (Campbell 2003:36-38). The French,
partially to stem the advance of the Spanish, wanted to increase their fur trading territory and gain control
of the Mississippi River valley. By 1682, LaSalle, a Frenchman, launched an expedition down the
Mississippi River that claimed all of the lands drained by the river for France followed by a colonization
effort to settle the mouth of the Mississippi River. Subsequent to the French incursion into the region, the
Spanish increased the rate of establishing settlements in Texas (Campbell 2003:41-45, 48).

The Spanish mission system did not expand during the 18th century. Native American attacks and a lack of
colonists contributed to the decline of Spanish settlement in Texas. In 1762, the Spanish acquired Louisiana
from the French, which slowed the need to settle east Texas. In 1800, Spain ceded Louisiana back to France,
who then sold it to the United States. From 1800 to the 1820s, the population of Texas decreased as a result
of the effects of the Mexican Revolution. In 1821, Mexico finally gained its independence from Spain. This
newly independent country encouraged Anglo-American settlement within Texas; this effort was led by
Stephen F. Austin. Austin came to an agreement with the Mexican government in which he would bring
settlers to Texas and, in return, he would be rewarded with land and money. By 1830, ten thousand AngloAmericans, mostly from the southeast United States, had settled in Texas (Campbell 2003:105-110).
Texas operated as an independent nation for 10 years (1836 to 1846) and during this time, the Mexican
government never truly recognized its independence. In 1846, Texas was annexed by the United States and
it was now up to the United States government to settle the border dispute with Mexico. The Mexicans
claimed the Nueces River as the international border, while the United States claimed the Rio Grande as
the demarcation line. After two years of skirmishes and an attack on Mexico City, the United States
succeeded in its efforts; with the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Mexico recognized the Rio Grande as the
border and ceded the entire southwest to the Pacific Ocean to the United States (McComb 1989:57).
At the time of annexation by the United States, west Texas was relatively unexplored territory, home to
various Native American groups. Settlers began slowly pushing into this territory in the mid-19th century.
In 1848, the United States Army stationed troops in west Texas and created travel routes through this new
territory, which would become corridors for pioneers traveling to California. These included the Chihuahua
Trail, which led from Mexico to Indianola, Texas, and Horsehead Crossing and Castle Gap in Crane County,
all of which were utilized as trade networks during the prehistoric period as well as forming part of a historic
transportation corridor linking Mexico, the United States and Canada. Castle Gap functioned as a primary
route for the United States Cavalry, California Forty-niners, cattle drives, stage coaches, and wagon trains.
During the Civil War, Texas was a large contributor to the Confederacy, but differed significantly from
other southern states. Texas was a frontier state, with a diversified population of Mexicans, AngloAmericans, and Native Americans. The state also had a large European immigrant population, many of
whom were small farmers. Two-thirds of the farmers in the state were non-slave holding, which meant that
the agricultural economy was maintained following the Civil War. In addition, cattle ranches were a large
industry, resulting in economic diversity. Thus, Texas was not as negatively impacted economically as other
southern states during post-Civil War Reconstruction (Campbell 2003:209, 213).
The Native Americans in Texas saw the defeated Confederacy and the weakened Texas as a chance to
regain lands they had lost. After the Civil War, the Comanche and Apache occupied the areas of west Texas.
In response to the increase in Native American attacks, the United States sent troops to reoccupy several
forts. By 1874, a major campaign was initiated that took away Native Americans’ horses, destroyed their
villages, and forced them to return to their reservations. The consolidation of Native Americans on
reservations allowed Anglo-Americans to settle permanently in west Texas (Campbell 2003:291, 295).
Following these campaigns, the military sent troops to conduct detailed expeditions of the former Native
American lands. By 1876, several of the counties northeast of the APE were surveyed by parties from Fort
Concho. Ranchers moved into these areas and began raising large herds of cattle, as the demand for beef
had risen after the Civil War. New cattle trails developed throughout west Texas, where large herds were
driven hundreds of miles north to the mid-western railroad routes. In 1881, the Texas and Pacific Railway
extended their rail lines through west Texas; up to this point, rail transportation was only available in east
Texas. Between the 1870s and 1890s, 8,000 miles of railway track were laid, connecting the entire state.
The new railroads significantly reduced the time and distance it took the cattle industry to transport their
herds to market (Campbell 2003:297, 306).

The expansion of the railroad connected the rural communities of west Texas with the booming cities to
the east. Towards the end of the 19th century, cattle ranchers began to fence off their herds and create small
communities on the frontier. In 1895, a law was passed that broke up these larger ranches, allowing farmers
to purchase smaller tracts of land. This led to the end of open-range ranching and attracted additional
settlers. West Texas communities generally grew slowly due to poor soil conditions and the difficulty of
accessing water. People began to farm corn and cotton on the newly settled land, but ranching was still the
dominant economic activity of west Texas at the end of the 19th century.
Ward County covers 836 square miles of primarily flat lands in west Texas at the southern margin of the
High Plains and the eastern margin of the Chihuahuan Deserts. Ward County is bordered to the north by
Loving, Winkler, and Ector counties, to the east by Crane County, and across the Pecos River to the south
and west by Pecos and Reeves counties. The county was formally designated by the Texas Legislature in
1887 and named in honor of prominent Texas statesman Thomas William Ward. By 1890, the county had
a population of only 75 residents (Justice and Leffler 2010). The previous year, in 1889, the Texas
Legislature passed an act to encourage irrigation and development in West Texas which drew the interest
of the Rhode Island capitalist George E. Barstow, who, along with other developers promoted a town site
in western Ward County on the Texas and Pacific Railway in 1891 (Hazelwood 2010). Ward County was
then formally organized with the town of Barstow named the county seat, in 1892, and by 1893, a red
sandstone County Courthouse had been constructed at Barstow. Irrigation based agriculture was successful
during the first decade and by 1904 the area was noted for crops of melons, grapes, peaches and pears. By
1900, Barstow had a population of 1,103, and Ward County had a population of 1,451 (Hazelwood 2010;
Justice and Leffler 2010). The dam constructed on the Pecos River near Barstow collapsed in 1904 and the
resulting flood ruined the fields with salt laden water. The subsequent droughts in the region in 1907 and
1911 also took their toll on the local orchard and vineyard economy and by 1911 the fruit industry was in
decline, and by 1918, the short-lived fruit industry in Ward County had ceased (Hazelwood 2010; Justice
and Leffler 2010). Agriculture did continue, as cotton production increased from 3,000 acres reported in
1910 to 10,000 acres reported in 1920 (Justice and Leffler 2010). In 1926, random drilling resulted in the
discovery of the Hendrick Oilfield in central Winkler County, immediately north of Ward County (Smith
2010a, 2010b). The rapid development of the of the Hendrick Oilfield brought growth to eastern and central
Ward County (Smith 2010a). The shifting of county economic activity in the region from irrigation based
agriculture, to oil and gas development resulted in a population and economic shift from the west to the
eastern portion of the county. In 1924, Barstow had declined in population from 1,103 in 1910, to an
estimated 490 in 1924 and 468 in 1930 (Hazelwood 2010). While in the east, the community of Monahans
had an estimated 89 residents in 1905, a population of 378 in 1910 and 816 residents in 1930 (Justice and
Leffler 2010). Monahans incorporated in 1928 and replaced Barstow as the County Seat ten years later in
1938. The community grew quickly, and by 1940 the population of Monahans was 3,944 (Justice and
Leffler 2010). The population of Ward County was 9,575 in 1940, and increased to 13,346 in 1950, and
subsequently 14,917 in 1960, before declining to 13,019 in 1970, then reporting 13,976 in 1980 (Justice
and Leffler 2010). The current July 2016 population estimate for Ward County is 11,610 (United States
Census Bureau [USCB] 2017).
Pyote, Texas, located approximately 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southeast of the Halcon Pipeline APE, experienced
similar economic development in the late 1920s due to the Hendrick Oilfield. The population of Pyote in
1925 was a reported 100, which swelled by 1928 to 3,500, as the community was the shipping and
distribution hub for the regions oil activity (Smith 2010a). The local boom in Pyote was relatively short due
to the completion of a Texas-New Mexico Railway spur from Monahans to Kermit in 1929, with a three
mile branch to Wink (Smith 2010a; Justice and Leffler 2010; Cravens 2010). By 1930, the Texas New
Mexico Railway connected to Lovington, New Mexico (Cravens 2010), and this eastern Ward County
railway connection effectively ended the oil-shipping boom in Pyote (Smith 2010a, Justice and Leffler
2010). By 1931, the population of Pyote had decreased to 1,097. Pyote was not incorporated until 1933, but
by 1941, only 201 residents were still living in the recently incorporated limits of the town (Smith 2010a).

The lands to the west and south of Pyote are primarily relatively flat University of Texas lands. The
topography, uninhabited lands status and climate were suitable for the rapid development of the of the Pyote
Army Airfield, which would be renamed the Pyote Air Force Station, just two miles (3.2 km) east of the
Halcon Pipeline. Construction of the base on 2,745 acres of University of Texas lands one mile southwest
of Pyote began on September 5, 1942 (Colwell 2010). The base came to be known as the “Rattlesnake
Bomber Base” by the servicemen stationed there due to its remote location, topography and the lack other
dominant fauna of the region. Servicemen began moving into the uncompleted base within one month of
the initiation of construction and by October of 1944, the base was home to over 6,500 residents (Colwell
2010). In fact, the base had grown to become the largest bomber-training base in the United States within
four months of its opening, as the home of the 19th Bombardment Group, on January 5, 1942 (Colwell
2010). The triangular arrangement of two 8,400-foot runways, aprons, and some ancillary taxiways can still
be seen on aerials. During World War II, the based trained crews for the B-17 Flying Fortress, and then
beginning in the summer of 1944, the B-29 Superfortress. In November 1945, control of the base changed
from the Second Air Force to the San Antonio Air Technical Service Command when it became an aircraft
storage depot (Colwell 2010). By the end of the Korean War in 1953, most of the planes in storage at Pyote
had been moved or scrapped, including the “Enola Gay” B-29 Superfortress, which had carried nuclear
bomb to Hiroshima, which was moved to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum on December
2, 1953 (Colwell 2010; Smith 2010b). During the later 1950s, into the mid 1960’s, the 607th Aircraft Control
and Warning Squadron of the Air Defense command continued to operate a radar facility at Pyote until the
facility was closed in 1965. Other than, a few other features, the “Rattlesnake Bomber Base Museum” and
a portion of the barracks which became the West Texas Children’s Home in 1966, and later the West Texas
State School in 1990 (Smith 2010c), not much of the base is present since its deactivation in the mid-1960s.
From the 1941 population of 201, the immediate area of Ward County, and Pyote, grew to support a base
with a population over 6,500 in 1945, only to decline to less than 200 people during the 1970s. In 2000, the
population of Pyote was 131 people in 2000 (Smith 2010b).

METHODOLOGY
The cultural resources survey followed the THC’s Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. The APE
was surveyed by using parallel pedestrian transects spaced no more than 50 feet (15 m) apart. The entire
100 foot (30 m) wide APE within the proposed Halcon Pipeline APE on University of Texas lands was
subjected to pedestrian survey for cultural resources.
Shovel testing density within the survey corridor followed minimum standards outlined by the THC’s and
the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) practices and procedures, which call for 16 shovel tests per
mile is settings which have the potential for buried deposits. Shovel testing is not required in areas with
slopes greater than 20 percent or which do not exhibit potential for buried deposits. Shovel test pits are also
not excavated in areas with standing water or in areas in which underground utilities are present.
Shovel tests generally measure 30 cm in diameter and are excavated by digging to bedrock, a stratigraphic
deposit (e.g. subsoil) that is determined to be below Holocene aged deposits, or to 80-100 cm (dependent
on soil matrix consistency and hardness). All shovel test pit fill is passed through ¼ inch mesh screen or
gone through by hand if the soil will not pass through the screen. Shovel test pits are excavated in arbitrary
10 cm levels unless stratigraphic changes are observed. The cultural resources survey of the 100 foot (30
m) wide APE met the minimum standards outlined by the THC’s and the CTA’s practices and procedures
(13 TAC 26.5 and 26.20).

BACKGROUND RESEARCH

Pre-field background research was conducted to determine if any cultural resources have been previously
recorded within the proposed Halcon Pipeline APE or within 1-mile of the APE. This research assists in
determining the types of resources in the area and the probability of encountering those resources during
fieldwork Prior to the survey, a search of the Atlas was conducted by Michael M. Margolis to locate
previously recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, NHRP properties, and SALs. Four
archeological sites, 41WR11, 41WR12, 41RV6, and 41RV60 have been previously recorded within 1-mile
of the APE. Only two of the four archeological sites, 41WR11 and 41WR12, have been previously recorded
within 1-mile APE on University of Texas lands.
Site 41WR11 is a large multi-component prehistoric site recorded by Durral M. Shirey in December 1990.
A large quantity of Paleoindian Period projectile points, Archaic Period projectile points, burins, scrapers,
manos, metates, and burned rock hearths were recorded in 1990, but collections from the site are noted as
far back as the mid-1960s. The site was determined eligible for listing on the NRHP by the SHPO on June
8, 2004. Site 41WR11 is over 1,300 feet (396 m) from the APE and will not be impacted by construction
of the Halcon Pipeline.
No information other than the location of site 41WR12 is included within the Atlas. Site 41WR12 is mapped
over 3,400 feet (1,036 m) from the APE and will not be impacted by construction of the Halcon Pipeline.
Site 41RV6 is a Late Prehistoric lithic scatter recorded by Donny L. Hamilton in May 1979. Materials
recorded at the site include dart points, Toyah and Scallorn arrow points, and stone beads. The site has not
been assessed for NRHP eligibility. Site 41RV6 is located over 2,700 feet (823 m) from the APE and will
not be impacted by construction of the Halcon Pipeline.
Site 41RV60 is an Early Archaic lithic scatter recorded by URS Corporation in March 2014. Materials
recorded at the site include an Andice-like dart point fragment, two core fragments, seven flakes, and a
possible ground stone fragment. The site was determined eligible for listing on the NRHP by the SHPO on
April 8, 2014. Site 41RV60 is located over 4,500 feet (1,372 m) from the APE and will not be impacted by
construction of the Halcon Pipeline.
Based on the Atlas, 12 archeological surveys or studies are mapped within 1-mile of the APE. Only five of
the 12 surveys or studies are mapped within 1-mile of the APE on University of Texas lands: Atlas Numbers
8400004682, 8400004691, 8500060944, 8500080410, and 8500080816. No information is provided on
Atlas Numbers 8400004682 and 8400004691, other than that they were surveys conducted in July 1995
and June 1995, respectively, for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) projects. Atlas Number
8500060944 is a reconnaissance level survey conducted by TAS, Inc. in May 2014 in advance of a Dawson
Geophysical seismic project. Atlas Number 8500080410 is a survey conducted by URS Corporation in May
2017 in advance of the ONCOR Permian Basin to Culberson 138kV Transmission Line. Atlas Number
8500080816 is a survey conducted by SWCA Environmental Consultants in November 2017 in advance of
the Audubon Engineering Company’s Oryx Pipeline.
Overall background research of the region suggests that the APE is located within a larger area where
climatic conditions, burrowing rodents, and the effects of ranching and oil and gas exploration have each
impacted the cultural landscape leading to two types of general settings. Wind erosion and extensive
bioturbation from rodent burrowing, and sheep and cattle grazing have exposed the upper surface of the
landscape within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas. With the exception of a few geomorphological
locations, archeological sites of all ages may be located on the exposed ground surface and/or were never
buried (Hall 2006:2-7). The majority of archeological sites are located on eroded surfaces and therefore

Page 13

lack vertical integrity and stratigraphy (Hall 2006:2-15). While intact archeological deposits may be
encountered where depositional processes, such as (a) colluvial; (b) eolian sand deposits associated with
the playa margins; (c) upland playa and lake fill deposits; and (d) within and adjacent to extant and/or
extinct draws and/or drainages of Late-Pleistocene to early Holocene age (Hall 2006:2-7, 2-11; Johnson
and Holliday 2004:285, 290, 294). The APE on University of Texas lands is located within the areas of
eroded and exposed surfaces, and sites would be expected to be resting on the surface, or ephemerally
exposed by shifting sand dunes.

RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the Halcon Pipeline APE on University of Texas lands was conducted
December 5-7, 2017 by Julie Wasinger and Gary D. Edington, ENERCON archeologists who meet the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61.
All aspects of the project were supervised by Michael M. Margolis, an ENERCON archeologist who meets
the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36
CFR 61. Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the THC Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
The cultural resources survey APE on University of Texas lands consists of the approximately 7.35 miles
(11.83 km) by 100 feet (30 m) survey corridor, and the additional 200 by 200 foot (61 by 61 m) workspace
block area north of Interstate Highway 20, totaling approximately 90.01 acres (36.43 hectares).
During the fieldwork, the weather was seasonal, with temperatures as low as 30°F in the morning and
afternoon highs ranging from 40-60°F with partly cloudy skies and relatively low winds. Early morning
snow flurries on December 7 rapidly melted due to ground temperatures. Vegetation within the APE was
typical desert scrub-shrub with creosote bush, mesquite, intermittent thin mixed grasses, and occasional
narrow leaf yucca. From the north end of the APE on University of Texas lands until approximately County
Road 2355, the terrain was flat to gently sloped with some rolling active sand dunes and vegetation was
generally thin mesquite trees, creosote bush, and thin mixed grasses, with an average GSV greater than 60
percent (Figures 3 and 4). The proposed Halcon Pipeline ROW parallels existing pipeline ROWs along this
segment (Figures 2.1 and 2.2). From County Road 2355 to Interstate Highway 20, the terrain was generally
flat with minor areas of sand dunes and the vegetation was dominated by creosote bush with thin grasses
and occasional mesquite trees, with an average GSV greater than 80 percent (Figures 5 and 6).
The cultural resources survey of the proposed Halcon Pipeline Project on University Lands resulted in the
observation of one isolated find (IF). IF#1 consists of a non-diagnostic distal tip of a projectile point/knife
(PPK) observed on the surface 34 feet (10 m) northwest of the centerline in the margin of an existing
pipeline ROW (Figures 7-11). IF#1 is made of a white quartzite and measures 28 by 20 mm, and exhibited
a hinge impact fracture on the proximal end (Figures 7-8). There are no diagnostic indicators on the tool,
such as parallel flake scars or typological characteristics which would allow for any temporal, functional,
or cultural affiliation inferences of the tool, thus it was categorized as a PPK. GSV at the location of IF#1
was over 80 percent (Figures 9 and 10). A pedestrian grid was surveyed at 3-5 m intervals at the location
of IF#1 and two shovel tests excavated to 80 cm failed to identify any additional cultural materials (Figure
11).
The cultural resources survey of the Halcon Pipeline APE on University of Texas lands did not result in
finding any additional historic or prehistoric artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or sites and no artifacts were
collected.

RECOMMENDATIONS

ENERCON, in support of Salt Creek Midstream, LLC, conducted an intensive cultural resources survey
for the proposed Halcon Pipeline. The proposed pipeline is approximately 43.3 miles (69.7 km) in length
and located near Pecos, Texas in Ward and Reeves counties. This report encompasses only the portion of
the proposed Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas lands in Ward County, Texas. The University of Texas
is a political subdivision of the State of Texas. The portion of the Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas
lands is approximately 7.35 miles (11.83 km) in length and is depicted on the USGS Pyote West, Tex.
(1969, Photorevised 1981), 7.5 Minute Quadrangle. The construction corridor consists of a 50 feet (15 m)
wide permanent pipeline ROW and a 50 feet (15 m) wide temporary workspace corridor. An additional
temporary workspace which measures 200 by 200 feet (61 by 61 m) wide occurs at a bore location on the
north side of the Interstate Highway 20 crossing. The cultural resources survey APE consists of the 7.35
miles (11.83 km) long by 100 foot (30 m) wide survey corridor and the additional 200 by 200 foot (61 by
61 m) workspace block area north of Interstate Highway 20, totaling 90.01 acres (36.43 hectares).
The cultural resources investigation is intended to assist in adhering to the 1969 Antiquities Code of Texas
and the cultural resources survey on University of Texas lands was completed under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 8274. All aspects of the project were supervised by Michael M. Margolis, an ENERCON
archeologist who meets the U.S. Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for
archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61.
Prior to the survey, a search of the Atlas was conducted by Michael M. Margolis to locate previously
recorded archeological sites, archeological surveys, NRHP properties, and SALs. Based on the Atlas, two
archeological sites, 41WD11 and 41WD12, have been recorded within 1-mile of the APE on University of
Texas land. Neither site is located closer than 1,300 feet (400 m) from the APE and neither site will be
impacted by construction of the proposed Halcon Pipeline. Based on the Atlas, two archeological surveys
or studies are mapped within 1-mile of the APE on University of Texas lands.
The cultural resources survey of the Halcon Pipeline APE on University of Texas lands was conducted
December 5-7, 2017 by Julie Wasinger and Gary D. Edington, ENERCON archeologists who meet the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for archeology as set forth in 36 CFR 61.
Fieldwork was conducted in accordance with the THC Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
The cultural resources survey of the proposed Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas lands resulted in the
observation of IF#1, a non-diagnostic PPK fragment observed on the surface 34 feet northwest of the
centerline in the margin of an existing pipeline ROW. Ground surface visibility at the location of IF#1 was
over 80 percent. A pedestrian survey grid at 3-5 meter intervals was traversed at the location of IF#1 and
two shovel tests excavated in the vicinity failed to identify any additional cultural materials. IF#1 lacks
additional information potential and is therefore not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or SAL listings,
and no further work is recommended at the location of IF#1.
The cultural resources survey of the Halcon Pipeline APE did not result in finding any additional historic
or prehistoric artifacts, features, cultural lenses, or archaeological sites and no artifacts were collected on
University of Texas lands. Therefore, it is recommended that construction of the proposed Halcon Pipeline
on University of Texas lands will have no effect on any historic property that may qualify for inclusion on
the NRHP or SAL listings. No further cultural resources investigations are recommended prior to
construction of the proposed Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas lands. If cultural material, including
sites, features, or artifacts that are 50 years old or older are encountered within the APE during construction
of the Halcon Pipeline on University of Texas lands, work in the area must cease and the regional THC
Archeologist must be notified immediately.
