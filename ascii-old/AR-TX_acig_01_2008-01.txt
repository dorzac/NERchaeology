MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Between Oct. 29-30, 2007 and on Feb. 6, 2008 archeologists from aci Consulting (aci), of Austin, Texas
conducted an archeological survey in (and adjacent to) San Gabriel Park in advance of the proposed
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) College Street Bridge replacement in Georgetown,
Williamson County, Texas. The project was completed for Turner, Collie, & Braden, Inc. under contract
(#14-448P5008). This investigation was conducted as an identification level survey in accordance with
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act as amended (36 CFR 800) and the Texas
Antiquities Code. The non-collection survey utilized methods that conformed to revised Texas Historical
Commission (THC) survey standards.
The purpose of the investigation was to determine if archeological deposits exist in good context within
the Area of Potential Effects (APE) for the proposed College Street Bridge replacement. Identified
resources were evaluated for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs). In total, the investigation consisted of a site files search, preparation
of an inventory research design, consultation with TXDOT, pedestrian survey of the entire APE,
systematic excavation of shovel testing in undeveloped areas, systematic auger testing north of the San
Gabriel River, and in-field analysis of prehistoric artifacts.
The proposed College Street Bridge replacement project consists of approximately 2,496.45-ft (760.92-m)
of bridge replacement, road repaving, cul-de-sac, and other improvements within and adjacent to the San
Gabriel River Park. The specific area of the aci survey contained this physical APE plus an additional
1115.2-ft (340-m) long and approximately 196.85-ft (60-m) wide corridor north of College Street,
between the proposed bridge, the western terminus of Walden Drive, and the San Gabriel River. In total,
the survey area included approximately 7.50 acres of modified parkland.
In order to investigate the area for archeological resources, pedestrian transects were initially walked at a
maximum of 15-m (49.21-ft) intervals along all proposed improvements north and south of the San
Gabriel River. Following this, seventy-nine (79) shovel tests (ST) were excavated to an average depth of
30-40 centimeters (cm) below surface (cmbs) in the undeveloped portions. A total of 12 STs towards the
western edge of the survey area were positive for prehistoric resources and modern trash; however, the
resources were identified in disturbed contexts immediately over bedrock. Modern trash was also found
in direct association with many of these artifacts. The prehistoric resources are associated with
41WM432, a previously recorded prehistoric site consisting of lithic artifacts, burned rock, and snail
shells located in the vicinity of the proposed project south of the San Gabriel River. The actual size of
41WM432 was not clearly defined by previous surveys (see Bradle 2002).
No other resources were noted in the remainder of the surveyed areas; conditions also suggested extensive
modern modifications (including landscaping, leveling, road and parking lot construction, City of
Georgetown related office and infrastructure construction, and other improvements). This has resulted in
considerable impacts throughout the survey area. As a result, soils were consistently disturbed and/or
truncated.
Since the recovered materials lack integrity, it is recommended that they are not eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP or as a SAL. However, because 41WM432 was originally plotted by Bradle (2002) as
extending over a larger area, and aciâs survey was limited to the survey area associated with the proposed
bridge replacement and improvements, an eligibility recommendation cannot be made for the site as a
whole. It is, therefore, recommended that the portion of 41WM432 where the disturbed materials were
noted should represent a non-contributing element to the eligibility of the site. Based on the results of the

i

current survey, no further investigations are recommended for the proposed College Street Bridge project,
provided any future construction activities do not leave the defined limits of the survey and APE. If
confined to the proposed survey area, it is recommended the proposed undertaking will have no effect on
any known archeological resources or NRHP or SAL eligible archeological historic properties.

INTRODUCTION
TxDOT has proposed replacing the College Street Bridge across the San Gabriel River, in San Gabriel
Park, Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed undertaking would replace an
existing bridge and its approaches with a new bridge located 68.58-m (225-ft) downstream from the
current structure. Overall, this would involve approximately 2,496.45-ft (760.92-m) of bridge
replacement, road repavement, and other improvements within the San Gabriel Park. The specific area of
the aci survey consisted of this physical Area of Potential of Effect (APE) and additional 1115.2-ft (340m) long and approximately 186.85-ft (60-m) wide corridor north of College Street, between College
Street and the San Gabriel River. In total, the survey area included approximately 7.5 acres of modified
parkland.
In compliance with 36 CFR 800 and the Texas Antiquities Code, an archeological survey was conducted
in the APE corridor north and south of the San Gabriel River by aci under TAC Permit # 4421. This noncollection survey utilized methods that conformed to revised Texas Historical Commission (THC) survey
standards. All work was conducted under contract to Turner, Collie, & Braden, Inc. (Contract #14448P5008). The results of this survey will be subject to review by TxDOT and THC.
The survey by aci was conducted on October 29-30, 2007. A revisit was then conducted on Feb. 6, 2008
after it was determined that a small portion of the APE (north of the river) had been excluded from
survey. Fieldwork was completed by project archeologist Jim Gillentine and field technicians Theresa
Miller and Matt Taylor, under the general direction of Stephen W. Yost, R.P.A. (Principal Investigator).
This effort included a site file review, consultation with City of Georgetown and TXDoT personnel, a
pedestrian survey of the entire APE, auger testing north of the San Gabriel River in the San Gabriel Park,
and shovel testing south of the river in areas requiring such testing as per current Texas Historical
Commission guidelines. The initial report was prepared between December 1 and December 15, 2007 and
revised in March 2008 to include the results of the February 6 field investigations.
A shallowly buried deposit of prehistoric artifacts (mixed with modern trash) was identified in a disturbed
context immediately over bedrock. Bedrock was also exposed at the modern ground surface in numerous
areas within the survey area and extensive areas of modern disturbance were also noted. The identified
resources are associated with a prehistoric site of undetermined NRHP/SAL eligibility (41WM432).
Since the resources within the survey area lack integrity, no additional work is recommended in
association with the proposed undertaking. However, because the survey was strictly limited to the
defined survey area, and the previously plotted extent of 41WM432 covers a larger area, the overall
eligibility of the site cannot be fully addressed at this time. Based on the available data, it is
recommended the portion of 41WM432 within the current survey area and APE be considered a noncontributing element to the NRHP/SAL eligibility of the site.

AREA OF POTENTIAL EFFECTS/DEFINITION OF SURVEY AREA
The undertaking would replace an existing low-water crossing and approaches between North College
Street and Riverhaven Drive within the San Gabriel River Park (Figure 2 and 3). The proposed location
of the new bridge is approximately 225-ft (68.58-m) downstream (east) of the existing structure (Figures
2 and 3). The new structure would have an overall width of approximately 60 ft and would connect with
Riverhaven Drive to the north, and North College Street to the south. Associated improvements are
identified in Appendix A and include:
â¢ 302-ft (92.05-m) of new road construction to connect North College Street and the new bridge
(south of the river)
â¢ 646.29-ft (196.99-m) of new road construction to connect the Riverhaven Drive to the new bridge
(north of the river)
â¢ repaving of 858.92-ft (261.80-m) of North College Street south of the river between the western
terminus of Walden Drive and the proposed new bridge location approximately 250-ft (76.2-m) to
the east.
â¢ 505.64-ft (154.12-m) of repaving of an eastern loop of Walden Drive from North College Street
to City of Georgetown facilities (south of the river)
â¢ One approximately 91.80-ft (27.98) diameter cul-de-sac west of the new bridge location as a
terminus to Morrow Road (north of the river)
â¢ One approximately 91.80-ft (27.98-m) diameter cul-de-sac south of the river, just west of the
existing low water crossing
As per the draft Categorical Exclusion document, a new right of way (ROW) will need to be acquired for
the new bridge location, connecting roads, and cul-de-sacs, as described above. Based on the available
information, all other work will be confined to the existing ROWs of the current road alignments..
It should be noted that according to schematic plans the repaving of Walden Drive to the city facilities is
actually off the current alignment of the road (in a bulldozed and landscaped area immediately to the
west) (Appendix A). As a precaution, the plotted location and the current path of Walden Drive were both
examined by aci personnel. Both are in a heavily modified, landscaped, and bulldozed area.
Construction methods are expected to include surface repaving, curb and gutter replacement, new road
construction, and new bridge construction. Detailed methods are not available for most proposed
improvements. However, existing information in the draft Categorical Exclusion document indicates that
the new bridge would span the river, utilizing eight 75-ft bridge spans and seven sets of 3-ft wide
columns. The vertical alignment would also be raised 25-ft.
For the purposes of the current archeological survey, the survey area was defined as the physical APE was
described, plus an additional buffer along North College Street (between the new bridge location and the
western terminus of Walden Drive). This buffer extended from College Street to the San Gabriel River
(to the north). Along proposed areas of repaving, road improvements, and/or new road construction, a 30m (98.42-ft) wide survey corridor centered on either the existing centerline of the current road or
proposed centerline of the new road was established. The cul-de-sac location north of the river which
mostly overlaps Morrow Road was individually surveyed since this falls outside of these 30-m (98.42-ft)
corridors; the cul-de-sac south of the river falls within the survey block north of College Street. The
wider survey area, south of the river, was established to accommodate investigations in the vicinity of
where the project overlaps the previously plotted location of 41WM432 (see Senn 2007). Overall, this
portion was 340-m (1115.5-ft) long and approximately 60-m (196.85-ft) wide. The combined survey area
therefore includes a combined APE and additional survey block acreage of approximately 7.50-acres.

The surveyed lands are within San Gabriel Park in the City of Georgetown and are owned by the city. The
cost to replace the College Street Bridge would be approximately $4.5 million and would use a
combination of federal and state funds. The funding for this project would be provided by the Structures
Replacement and Rehabilitation Program and the City of Georgetown.

ORGANIZATION
This report was prepared in accordance with current Council of Texas Archeologists Guidelines and the
Secretary of the Interiorâs Standards for Archeological Documentation. All aci supervisory staff
employed on this project meets the professional standards established by the Texas Antiquities Code
(Chapter 26.17) and the Secretary of the Interior Standards and Guidelines for Archeology and Historic
Preservation. The report covers all aspects of fieldwork and analysis. It includes a management summary,
introduction, descriptions of regional environmental and archeological contexts, a description of
methodology, and the results of the investigation. Recommendations regarding the NRHP/SAL eligibility
of archeological resources and any need for additional work conclude the body of the report. The survey
and recommendations are subject to review by TxDOT and THC.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
The current survey area consists of the project APE north and south of the San Gabriel River within and
adjacent to San Gabriel Park. The location is on the Georgetown 7.5 Minute Quadrangle (Figure 3).

GEOLOGY
The survey area is located within San Gabriel Park, in Williamson County, Texas. This is situated within
Central Texas on the Balcones Escarpment west of the Blackland Prairie region (Handbook of Texas
Online, 2006). In particular, the specific survey area is confined to the banks of the San Gabriel River,
which ââ¦flows from Burnet County eastward through Williamson County to its confluence with the
Little River in Milam County.â (Leatherwood, 2002). This location includes areas of deflated soils and
exposed bedrock (see Plates 1 and 2).

CLIMATE
Williamson County occurs within a temperate, humid subtropical region. Average annual temperature is
69Âº F; average maximum high is 97Âº F occurring in July; average maximum low is 35Âº F occurring in
January. Winters tend to be mild. Summer temperatures can be extreme with numerous consecutive days
over 100Âº F. Average annual rainfall for the county is 34.2-in with local areas receiving more or less.
Thunderstorms occur an average of 40 days per year, primarily in the spring. A record rainfall event of
36.4 inches in an 18-hour period occurred at Thrall, September 1, 1921. The region receives
approximately 300 days of sunshine per year and prevailing winds are from the south-southwest. Major
weather threats include extended dry periods, flash flooding, and tornadoes. The weather at the time of
field work was clear and sunny (Werchan and Coker, 1983: 2).

SOILS
The dominant soils for the area are characterized by ââ¦very shallow to moderately deep, calcareous and
noncalcareous, stony, cobbly, and loamy soils formed in indurated fractured limestone; on uplandsâ
(Werchan and Coker, 1983:7). There are four soil types in the vicinity of the survey area (Table 1).
Although the soils along the San Gabriel River are generally deep calcareous, loamy soils formed in
alluvium, those specifically within the survey area proved to be shallow with areas of exposed bedrock as
the result of modern mechanical activity and erosion.

FLORA AND FAUNA
Following the break of the Balcones Escarpment, eastern portions of Williamson County fall within the
Texan biotic province and western portions fall within the Balconian province (Blair 1950). Along the
same break, the county is also divided into the Blackland Prairie Natural Region in the east, and the
Edwards Plateau Natural Region in the west (TPWD 2001). The project and survey are located primarily
in the Edwards Plateau Natural Region.
Within the Balcones Fault Zone and extending in a north-south band through the central portions of the
county, the vegetative zone is primarily Silver Blugrass-Texas Wintergrass Grassland. Common species
found within this zone include little bluestem, sideoats grama, Texas grama, three-awn, hairy grama, tall
dropseed, buffalograss, windmillgrass, hairy tridens, tumblegrass, western ragweed, broom snakeweed,
Texas bluebonnet, live oak, post oak, and mesquite. Vegetation within the southeastern extent of the
county is classified as post oak woodlands and grassland mosaic. Common species found within this
vegetative zone include blackjack oak, eastern redcedar, mesquite, black hickory, live oak, sandjack oak,
cedar elm, hackberry, yaupon, poinson oak, American beautyberry, hawthorn, supplejack, trumpet
creeper, dewberry, coral-berry, little bluestem, silver bluestem, sand lovegrass, beaked panicum, threeawn, sprangle-grass, tickclover. Vegetation within the western portions of the county are primarily
composed of live oak/mesquite/Ashe juniper woodlands and parklands. Common species found within
these vegetative zones include post oak, Ashe juniper, shin oak, Texas oak, blackjack oak, live oak, cedar
elm, agarita, soapberry, sumac, hackberry, Texas pricklypear, Mexican persimmon, purple three-awn,
hairy grama, Texas grama, sideoats grama, curly mesquite, Texas wintergrass. Most of the county east of
the Balcones Escarpment has largely been converted to croplands and agricultural uses and is no longer
characteristic of native vegetative regions (TPWD 1984).

BUILT ENVIRONMENT
The survey area is currently used as a municipal park, the San Gabriel Park. A review of TARL records
dating back to the late 1970âs suggests that prior to clearing the vegetation around this portion of the San
Gabriel River was a mixture of hardwoods and vines with some pecan, mesquite, and Ashe juniper (Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas, 2007). Currently, it has been severely impacted by recent modifications,
including blading in some areas, addition of fill and retaining walls, construction of roads, parking lots
and sports facilities, and modern landscaping (Plates 3 - 10).

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND ARCHEOLOGICAL CONTEXT
CONTEXT
The APE falls within the Central Texas archeological region (Collins 1995). Prehistoric archeological
sites in Central Texas represent continuous human occupation starting around 11,500 years ago.
Throughout its occupation, hunting and gathering is believed to be the exclusive resource procurement
strategy of prehistoric Central Texans. Sites have been interpreted to represent relatively short-term
occupations. Deeper sites with large amounts of cultural materials are thought to be camps that were
returned to throughout the years, possibly on a regular basis.
Michael B. Collins (1995) authored a synthesis of Central Texas archeology. The prehistoric background
will be based in large part on his synthesis. Collins divides the prehistory of Central Texas into three
periods: (1) the Paleo-Indian, (2) the Archaic, and (3) the Late Prehistoric. Each of these is further divided
into subperiods, such as early and late. Smaller units of time referred to as âstyle intervalsâ are used to
coincide with the interval of use for a particular point style or group of point styles. These style intervals
can overlap or extend over more than one subperiod. However, most can be used to subdivide the
subperiods.
PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND
The Paleo-Indian period dates between approximately 12,000-8000 BP and is one of the least understood
periods in Texas prehistory. The earliest Native Americans known to inhabit Williamson County were
mobile foragers and hunters within the last centuries of the Early Archaic period (8,000-6,000 years ago).
Inhabitants of this region during that time are not as well documented as the Middle Archaic period
(6,000-3,500 years ago), in which central Texas saw a marked population increase and establishment of
trade networks. Diagnostic artifacts such as the Pedernales point and burned rock middens characterize
archeological sites from this particular time period on the eastern Edwards Plateau (Turner and Hester,
1999:57). There continues to be debate whether or not a population boom of the Middle Archaic
continued, fluctuated, or declined during the Late Archaic phase (3,500-1,200 years ago), but there is
evidence of prehistoric peoples shifting subsistence strategies to incorporate more hunting and trapping of
smaller game, as well as increased reliance on processed succulents in the central Texas region
(Mahoney, et. Al, 2003:22-23).
PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD
The Paleo-Indian period dates from approximately 12,000-8000BP. It is one of the least understood
periods in Texas prehistory due to the small number of sites that have been excavated in the area (Skinner
1981). A large amount of the evidence for this period comes from surface collected materials found
throughout the region. At Fort Hood, numerous distinctive projectile points associated with this period
have been found in multi-component surface sites and as surface isolates. These include Clovis, Folsom,
Angostura, Golondrina, and Plainview (Turner and Hester 1985).
These sites tend to be located along terraces above major drainages (Bryan 1931). Some of the previously
recorded rock shelters such as the Levi site, indicated intensive use despite their location, a considerable
distance from a major river (Bradle 2002). The Horn shelter (41BQ46) is the only rock shelter recorded in
central Texas which is immediately adjacent to a major river (Redder 1985).

18

ARCHAIC PERIOD
The Archaic period is a broad stretch of time in Texas prehistory from 8000BP-750AD. âThe Archaic
Stage dominates all other remains in central Texasâ (Prewitt 1981). Prewitt divided the Archaic into 11
phases, but Carlson et al (1986) has grouped them into Early, Middle, Late, and Terminal. Archaic sites
count for a majority of the sites in Williamson County, which supports Collins statement that the Archaic
accounts for 2/3 of central Texas prehistory.
According to Prewitt, the Early Archaic saw a shift in subsistence away from hunting to gathering. The
Middle Archaic saw an increase in specialization in subsistence gathering. This is emphasized by a sharp
increase in burned rock middens and mounds during this phase. The Late Archaic shows a decrease in the
number of burned rock middens and mounds. Large game, such as bison, is still an important food staple,
but no longer dominates subsistence activities. The Terminal Archaic sites show that there is again
increased importance placed gathering in the overall subsistence structure. It is during this phase that
archeology sites peak in density in the area as well (Prewitt 1981).
LATE PREHISTORIC
The Late Prehistoric is divided into two phases: the Austin Phase from 1250-650BP and the Toyah Phase
from 650-200BP. The main characteristic of the phase of prehistory in the region of Central Texas is the
change in technology. Several new technologies appear in the region during this phase in the
archeological record.
The most important feature of the Late Prehistoric is the appearance of arrow points in sites from this
time. These begin to appear during the Austin Phase and replace the use of dart/spear points and the atlatl.
The other technology changes are the introduction of ceramics at a later date and finally
agriculture/horticulture towards the end of the Prehistoric period. The introduction of agriculture seems to
have been of minimal importance as subsistence patterns changed little. A chronological model by
Dillehay (1974) shows bison were absent on the southern plains during the Austin phase, but present
during the later Toyah phase.
HISTORIC BACKGROUND
Bradle (2002:8-14) contained an excellent summary of the historic period of Williamson County and
Georgetown. An abbreviated version of this discussion is presented below. The reader is referred to
Bradle 2002 for additional details on the historic period.
Collins (1995:386) divides the historic period of Central Texas into three sub- periods: early, middle, and
late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and European peoples and cultures were present.
However, in the third the indigenous peoples had virtually disappeared. The early historic sub-period in
Central Texas began in the late 17th century with the first documented arrival of Europeans.
Aboriginal Occupation
Williamson County is situated within the historic range of the Tonkawa Indians who inhabited the area in
the 16th Century (Newcomb 1986). By the 19th Century, they had broken ties with the Comanche and
Wichita and were associated with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32). They have been described as typical
southern Plains Indians who were hunters and gathers and who lived along the streams and rivers of
Central Texas. Remains of this group have not been found in a historic context in Williamson County.
During this period, numerous aboriginal groups including the Caddo, Jumano, Tonkawa, Comanche, and
Lipan Apache (Newcomb 1986) occupied Texas. Trade is known to have existed between the Jumanos
and the Caddos. The Lipan Apaches and subsequently the Comanches entered the region from the Plains

19

while following key animal resources as they migrated into Texas. Contact period occupations are often
identified by the occurrence of glass beads, gun parts, gunflints, metal projectile points, and European
manufactured ceramics. The archival search did not locate any Historic Indian sites in Williamson
County. In nearby Coryell County, a blue glass bead was found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group
burial along the Leon River (Jackson 1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an isolated find
on Horse Creek in the extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell 1952).
European Colonization
The earliest European expedition likely to have visited present-day Williamson County was led by
Spaniard Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca. This expedition passed through Texas from 1527 to 1535. Some
workers believe that the eight months spent among the Avavares Indians relates to Tonkawas of the
Williamson area (Scarbrough 1973:52). The next recorded European visitation was led by the French
governor of Texas, Robert Cavalier Sieur de la Salle. In 1686 and 1687, La Salle met Indians and
described landmarks that, according to some scholars, were in Williamson County (Hackett 1931:519520).
In response to French activity in Texas, Captain Alonso de Leon followed Spanish government orders by
building El Camino Real (The King's Highway) in 1688. This road would be used to establish missions
being planned for east Texas. It was soon discovered that this roadway, skirting just to the east of present
Williamson County, became impassable when heavy rains overflowed streams. In such wet times, De
Leon designated a route to the west and north as the Camino de Arriba (the Upper Route). This road
crossed Brushy Creek, the San Gabriel River, and the Brazos River just north of its confluence with the
Little River. Passing through the heart of Williamson County, De Leon's trail-blazing effort represents the
first unequivocal Spanish exploration of the area immediately surrounding the project area.
In 1691, Spanish governor of Texas Domingo Teran de los Rios brought herds of cattle to missions
established the year before. This expedition consisted of 50 soldiers and 13 churchmen and passed
through southeastern Williamson County (Casteneda 1936 1:362; Bancroft 1884 XV:391; and Gard
1954:5). The next expedition occurred under the leadership of Spanish Captain Domingo Ramon and the
French trader, Juchereau de Saint Denis. The Ramon-St. Denis entourage, consisting of 75 men, 64 oxen,
490 horses and mules, and more than a thousand sheep and goats, spent several weeks in present-day
Williamson and adjoining Milam Counties. They met and traded with several thousand Native Americans
of various tribes. One of its clergy, Fray Espinosa, named several of the streams (Casteneda 1936 II:42,
and 51).
The Aguayo expedition was the largest Spanish exploration effort to cross present day Williamson
County. After traveling nearly a thousand miles, the huge delegation reached the Colorado River. From
there, it proceeded northeastward, crossing Chandler Branch and the South and North branches of the San
Gabriel River in central Williamson County (Castaneda 1936 111:131, 137). After traveling across the
Lampasas, Salado, San Andres (now called the Little), and Brazos Rivers to the north of the County, the
entourage turned eastward near present-day Waco to reestablish the inactive Spanish missions founded in
1691. In successfully re-planting permanent presence in Texas, this last of the major expeditions had kept
the French from capturing Texas (Bolton 1962:144; Bolton 1939:17-18; and Morfi 1935 1:221-223).
In general, the expedition followed present-day Interstate 35 through Williamson County (Hackett
1931:474). Following the advice of a Tonkawan chief El Cuilon (also called Juan Rodriguez), Aguayo
had followed the El Camino de Arriba through Williamson County, rather than the more heavily traveled
El Camino Real which the chief had deemed to be impassable for this huge expedition because of
marshes and thick woods {Hackett 1931:474).

Nineteenth Century Settlement
As early as the early 1820s, a few pioneers of Austin's Colony drifted beyond its boundaries to settle in
the valleys of Brushy Creek and San Gabriel River. The main body of Williamson County was part of the
Robertson Colony. Most of Williamson County's earliest residents came from Bastrop and the Webber's
Prairie area to the south and the Brazos River to the east (Scarbrough 1973:64-70).
Within the State of Coahuila and in Texas, the earliest regional governing precursor to Williamson
County was the Municipality of District of Viesca. This district lay northwest of the Camino Real,
extending to the east beyond the Brazos Valley. Along the Brazos, Tenoxtitlan, a Mexican military post
abandoned in 1832, became a large trading post; the closest one to the settlements of Williamson County.
The seats of government also were located on the West Bank of the Brazos, first in Sarahville de Viesca,
five miles north of Marlin, Falls County, and then Nashville, between present-day Gause and Hearne
(Scarbrough 1973:71-77).
Far removed from official security, these remote settlers suffered frequent Indian attacks. These attacks
stimulated the organization of one of the three original Texas Ranger companies in 1835. They built a
cedar facility near present Leander called the Tumlinson Block House (Barker 1925:329-330, 361,
Smithwick 1900:213, Yoakum 1856 11265- 267, Webb 1952 II:690, Brown 1896:85, De Shields
1912:90-93, Wilbarger 1889:190192). During 1835, the District was renamed the Municipality of Milam.
After the Mexican Army invaded Texas to put down the Revolution, Turnlinson's Block House Fort was
burned by Indians (Makemson 1904). Most of this company of Rangers had departed to assist General
Sam Houston at San Jacinto. The command of this company was placed under Major Robert M.
Williamson (Bolton 1962:141). With General Houston's victory at San Jacinto, the Republic of Texas
began to govern the vast territory. Milam was made a county, one of 23 original counties in the Republic.
In 1837, the United States suffered a devastating crop failure and depression. At this time, many new
immigrants settled in Milam County. The first organized settlement in Williamson County was Kenney's
Fort, located just east of present-day Round Rock. Dr. Thomas Kenney built a house and fort on the south
bank of Brushy Creek, just west of where Dyer Branch flows northward into the creek. However, Indian
raids continued to plague the settlers. In 1839, a particularly bloody conflict, the Battle of Brushy,
resulted in the death of several colonists and 20 to 30 Native Americans. Williamson County territory was
the setting for several other skirmishes occurred with Indians (Scarbrough 1973:80-97).
The 1840s witnessed steady growth of the area. New communities arose around mills, churches, and
general stores. Makemson (1904) identifies the location of these settlements: "At the time the county was
organized, with few exceptions, the settlements were confined to Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel
River. Comparatively few settlements were made far out in the prairies until the era of barbed wire and
the advent of railroads: (Makemson 1904). The first general mercantile store in the county was opened by
Nelson Morey in 1848 just south of present Hutto. That same year, R. H. Taliaferro organized Missionary
Baptist Church, the area's first Protestant church (Scarbrough 1973:108-115). Also in 1848, the county's
first school was built at Moss's Spring, just west of present Round Rock (Makemson 1904).
Led by San Jacinto hero Washington Anderson, a campaign was launched in 1848 to create a new county
in the area north of Travis County. The Legislature agreed, naming the area after longtime Judge Robert
McAlpin Williamson on March 13th, 1848. In May 1848, a tract of land lying between the North and
South San Gabriel Rivers, just south of their confluence, was donated by George Washington Glasscock
for the count seat. In his honor, it was named "Georgetown" (Scarbrough 1973:113-127).

21

By 1850, the population of Williamson County had grown to 1,568, and reached 3,779 by 1858
(Scarbrough 1973:141). In the 1860 Census, the County's population was 4,529, which rose slightly
during the tumultuous Civil War and Reconstruction years to 6,368 by 1870. During Post-Bellum
industrialization and tenant farm transition, population exploded to 15,155 in 1880, the highest rate of
increase over a 10-year period in the County's history. By 1870, Indian violence against settlers halted,
encouraging much greater settlement. Population continued to increase, but at a slightly lower rate,
totaling 25,909 in 1890, 38,072 in 1900, and 42,228 in 1910. From 1920 to 1970, population levels
actually declined, but they exploded in the past 25 years as Williamson County became part of the Austin
Metropolitan Area (Texas Almanac 1993: 335, citing United States Census data).
The City of Georgetown follows a similar pattern of population increase. From 1850 to 1870, it
experienced the modest growth from 200 to 320. From 1870 to 1880, phenomenal growth yielded 1,354,
and almost doubled to 2,447 in 1890. Increases were slight through 1960, except for 1920 when
populations slightly declined (United States Census).
The frontier moved westward, leaving in its wake a growing population and farming area in western
central Texas. The earliest farms grew commodities necessary for sustaining life for the pioneer settlers.
Of the 249,528 acres of land comprising the County in 1858, only 22,618 acres were in cultivation. These
consisted of 11,100 acres planted in corn, 9,350 in wheat, and 1,378 in cotton. As property of citizens,
4,000 horses and 25,000 cattle were listed (Williamson County tax rolls of 1858). Peaches and hogs were
also listed as agricultural commodities. In the 1850 U. S. Census, three-fourths of the men were listed as
"farmers," and most of the others' occupations were listed jointly with "farmer" (United States Census,
1850).
John S. Knight planted some of the first massive amounts of cotton in the county in 1870. Many acres of
eastern Williamson County became planted in Cotton during the 1870's and '80's. Gins and mills
involving the spin-off cottonseed industry flourished in Circleville, Granger, Taylor, and Georgetown. In
1899-1900, Williamson County led the state in number of bales of cotton produced. The County's first
gristmill was built by Wash Anderson on the north bank of Brushy creek in 1843, at present Round Rock.
After its destruction by flooding in 1845, others were maintained in the area throughout the 19th century.
Other antebellum mills were: Gann's Mill on Berry's Creek, from 1846 to 1916, Gooch's mills from 1849
onward, Mather's mill from 1852, Ira Chalk's mill in 1855, and Knight's Springs mills of Benjamin Gooch
and John W. Owens, between 1852 and 1855 (Scarbrough 1973:161-162). Throughout the postbellum
period to the end of the 19th century, numerous mills flourished throughout the County processing corn,
syrup, and other products. Carried out mostly in the western portions of the County, the cattle industry
reached its zenith from 1875 to 1900 (Scarbrough 1973:233-235).

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Prior to any fieldwork, a request was made to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the
University of Texas at Austin, the state repository for recorded sites information, to determine if any
known sites were located in the project corridor or within a one-mile radius of the project area. Nine sites
have been recorded within a 1-mi radius of the proposed project area (Table 2). There are eight prehistoric
sites, no historic or multi-component sites, and one site with no available information (41WM808). One
known site does overlap the project area (41WM432) (Figure 4). At least three previous surveys have also
been conducted in the immediate area. Whitsett and Fox conducted a survey for the city of Georgetown in
1979 for the cityâs waste water facility, Foster, Taylor and Glander conducted a survey in the area in 1994
for improvements to San Gabriel Park, and Bradle, Bernhardt, and Belew conducted a survey in 2002
again for improvements to San Gabriel Park.

Site 41WM432 was originally recorded as a prehistoric site containing lithic artifacts, burned rock, and
snail shells (Whitsett and Fox 1979). These resources were noted in gray-tan silty clay on gravel located
on a terrace adjacent the river (Whitsett and Fox 1979). A buried burned rock midden exhibiting charcoal
stained soil and containing lithic artifacts was recorded in the western portion of the site. It was noted by
Whitsett and Fox (1979) that the âeastern area of the site had been bladed to gravels and therefore
seriously disturbed.â Lithic debitage, an early unidentified barbedâ tool form, and burned rock were noted
as present, but it was also stated that the remaining soils were less than 20-cm (7.87-in) in depth. The
2002 AAG survey covered the project area north of the San Gabriel River in San Gabriel Park. The AAG
survey also reviewed a small section south of the river for an irrigation pipeline. Bradle reviewed
41WM432 during the survey and also concluded that only the western portion of the site had any
potential for intact deposits. The AAG survey recorded less than 20-cm (7.87-in) of soils present in the
central and eastern portions of 41WM432 that are within the current survey area.
No SAL or NRHP properties are recorded in the immediate vicinity of the project area, but a single
NRHP property lies approximately 1.60-km to the southwest: Casey House at 705 East 3rd St. There are
also two cemeteries just outside a 1-km radius of the proposed project area. The Georgetown Cemetery is
an active cemetery, approximately 2253.1-m (1.4-mi) south of the project area in the 600 block of Smith
Creek Road. It contains approximately 1,000 burials. The Guadalupe cemetery (aka âOld City Cemeteryâ
and âGeorgetown Catholic Cemeteryâ) is a predominately Hispanic cemetery containing about 200
burials and dating from the turn of the 20th century to the present. It is located off FM 971 north of the
San Gabriel River and is well outside the defined survey area.

RESEARCH DESIGN
An intensive archeological survey was proposed within the footprint of the bridge replacement and
associated improvements north and south of the San Gabriel River. This survey was designed to locate
any previously recorded or unrecorded sites and to assess the potential for adverse effects. Based on the
known presence of prehistoric site 41WM432 in the immediate vicinity, there was considered to be a
moderate to high probability for prehistoric resources within the survey area. The potential for historic
period sites was considered to be relatively low. This effort included a site file review, initial
reconnaissance, 100% pedestrian survey, and intensive shovel testing as discussed in the initial aci
Consulting scope of work (Senn 2007). Although backhoe trenching was also proposed, it was decided
that trenching was not merited after shovel testing indicated shallow, disturbed soils within the survey
area. In addition to the current survey, Bradle (2002) also recorded less than 20-cm (7.87-in) of soils in
the central and eastern portions of 41WM432 which overlap the current survey area. Methodologies are
described below.

SITE FILE REVIEW
An initial review of archeological site files was conducted in April 2007. The results were briefly
discussed in the previous section of this report. In addition, aci Consulting archeologists also reviewed
available historic maps of the vicinity. Finally, Bradleâs (2002) report was utilized to inform personnel of
potential resources associated with 41WM432.

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
Survey methods were designed to comply with THC/Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA) survey
standards. A pedestrian survey of the footprint was initially conducted to locate any surface indications of
archeological resources within the survey area. To achieve this, the footprint was walked in 15-m (49.21ft) transects. The pedestrian survey results were then utilized to determine the appropriate locations for
shovel test transects. If surface sites were encountered, a random sample of artifacts would have been
field-identified to quantify the density of the scatter and the types of artifacts present; no surface sites
were noted.

SUBSURFACE EXAMINATION
It was originally proposed that subsurface investigations would include both shovel testing and backhoe
trenching. Shovel tests were excavated in settings that had potential for buried cultural horizons. They
were excavated 30-cm (11.81-in) in diameter to the bottom of Holocene deposits. These tests were dug in
levels no thicker than 20-cm (7.87-in), and the excavated sediments were screened through Â¼-inch
hardware cloth.
The original research design proposed that only three back hoe trenches would be required to meet THC
requirements. However, since the location is within the boundaries of a known prehistoric site
(41WM432), and soils were both shallow and disturbed, backhoe trenching was not justified. Instead, the
effort was shifted to intensive shovel testing and judgmental auger testing (Figure 5). This comprised a
total of 79 shovel tests in eight transects, plus nine auger tests. Auger tests were all located north of the
river along the proposed road alignment connecting the proposed new bridge to Riverhaven Drive, and an
adjacent pre-existing park road (Morrow Road). Auger testing was chosen in this location since there
appeared to be very little potential for intact soils (this portion of the park has been previously leveled and
otherwise modified.

PHOTOGRAPHY
Extensive digital images were taken during the course of the survey. Overview photos were recorded for
the entire survey area and of each specific transect. Photos were also taken of all areas of disturbance
and/or other modern modification (including construction, landscaping, paving, and miscellaneous park
improvements). Positive shovel tests were photographed as well. Finally, since the survey was a noncollection effort, artifacts identified from shovel tests were recorded before reburial.

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
If potentially intact historic period archeological resources were identified, General Land Office Plat
maps and other historic maps were to be used in conjunction with USGS maps to determine property
boundaries and probable associations. Additional archival research would also have been conducted to
determine the nature and chronology of the occupation. The data collected from the sites was then to be
integrated into the present understanding of local and regional history. No historic artifacts were
identified during the survey, so intensive archival research was not necessary. Nevertheless, as part of a
basic sensitivity evaluation, historic map data including the 1928 USGS Georgetown Quadrangle and the
1894 â 1940 Georgetown Sanborn maps were consulted to ensure no resources were missed. No such
resources were noted in the vicinity.

SITE RECORDATION
Any newly discovered sites were to be investigated and recorded using TexSite Archaeological Data
Collection Software for submittal to TARL. As per THC standards, if surface visibility was less than 30
percent at these sites, a minimum of six shovel tests would be excavated to delimit site boundaries. Based
on the results of the shovel tests and surface inspection, newly recorded sites would then be evaluated for
NRHP/SAL eligibility. No new sites were identified; however, a portion of 41WM432 was encountered.
Nine shovel tests were excavated as part of efforts to delineate resources.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS AND CURATION
Artifact analysis during the project focused on in-field analysis and recordation. If any diagnostic
artifacts were collected from a site or subsurface context during the intensive survey, they would have
been temporarily housed at aciâs offices, in Austin, Texas. Such artifacts would then have been analyzed
and prepared for curation. However, no such artifacts were identified during the survey. Prehistoric
artifacts included only 53 items from disturbed contexts (typically associated with recent 20th century
trash). Non-diagnostic artifacts were not collected during any part of the survey.
Although no artifacts were collected, digital images will be curated at TARL after acceptance of the final
report. These will be curated along with all other project generated paperwork.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
SITE FILES SEARCH
A site file review was conducted in April 2007. This was supplemented by an additional review of TARL
files and historic maps immediately prior to fieldwork in October 2007. These reviews identified nine
archaeological sites within a 1-mi radius. No historic sites or likely resources were noted in the immediate
vicinity. Of the previously recorded sites, 41WM432 overlaps the current survey area. This site does not
have a previous NRHP/SAL eligibility recommendation or determination.

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY AND SHOVEL TESTING
The survey area was divided into four separate locales: an East Area (east of College Street and the
existing bridge), a West Area (west of the existing bridge between the river and North College Street), a
South Area (comprised of all areas south of College St within the surveyed APE), and a North area (north
of the San Gabriel River) (Figure 5). Field methods consisted of walking the entire APE in 15-m (49.21ft) pedestrian transects and then placing shovel tests along those transects south of the river in areas
meriting shovel testing as per THC survey standards. Shovel tests were placed 10-m (32.81-ft) apart in
order to ensure intensive coverage. Positive shovel tests were then bracketed at 5-m (16.4-ft) intervals in
each of the cardinal directions until two negatives (or the project boundary) were reached.
The portion of the survey north of the San Gabriel River was subjected to intensive pedestrian survey and
then auger testing to identify soil depth and integrity in the park area. The pedestrian survey identified
extensive modifications within the park, including road and parking lot construction, leveling, and
landscaping; some push piles were also noted (see Plates 8-10). Modern trash was also present along the
survey area. The east side of Morrow Road immediately north of the river is also currently utilized as a
gravel parking area.
The level of disturbance was then confirmed by auger testing. In total, nine auger tests were excavated
along the proposed road improvements adjacent to Morrow Road (Figure 5). The nine auger tests were
excavated and all were terminated at an average depth of 30 to 40-cm (11.81 to 15.75-in) due to dense
gravels. The results demonstrate that the soils in this portion of the survey area are extremely compacted
with high gravel content (10% or more). Gravels included both disturbed road gravels and degrading
bedrock gravels as well. Both confirm the truncated and disturbed nature of the soils along the proposed
survey areas. All auger tests were also negative; no artifacts were noted and only modern trash was
present in the vicinity.
Based on the results of the aci survey, there is little to no integrity, and only minimal soil development, in
the East, West, and South survey areas. Each of these areas will be discussed in greater detail in the
41WM432 site description that follows, since the previously plotted location of the site overlaps most of
the APE south of the river. Although a disturbed portion of 41WM432 was noted in the Wast Area
(between College Street and the San Gabriel River), almost the entire area appears to be truncated and/or
highly eroded. Shovel tests were typically terminated at bedrock at 20 to 50-cmbs (7.87 to 19.68-in).
The East Area appears to be the least impacted by modern construction and public activity. However,
extensive disturbance was still evident. It is located immediately east of the existing low water bridge
(Figure 5). The vicinity was overgrown with vegetation, cottonwood, greenbrier, poison ivy, and native
vines and grasses associated with rivers, creeks, and wetlands. It has been cleared and leveled, and the
location serves as a picnic and smoking area for the city offices to the south. Residual soils were typically
less than 20-cm (7.87-in) deep.

28

Finally, the South Area (along College Street) has been impacted by road and parking lot construction
(see Figure 5). Shovel testing suggests the road construction itself has created as much as 2 to 3-ft (0.61
to 0.91-m)of disturbed roadbed. Conditions along the route to the city facilities to the southeast of
College Street were even more severely impacted by modern development. These impacts include a fuel
depot with buried tanks and a large area which is currently being cleared and leveled by heavy machinery.
There are also numerous other impacts in the vicinity from construction and public use associated with
parking and city government facilities to the south and east.
Backhoe trenching was not conducted due to the highly disturbed and truncated nature of the soils
encountered within the survey area. The majority of the shovel tests were less than 50-cm (19.68-in) in
depth (typically 30-cm (11.81-in) or less). Those shovel tests which were positive for cultural material
also demonstrated no vertical temporal integrity, with modern and prehistoric artifacts often noted in a
common (mixed) context. The overall lack of soil depth and the compromised integrity indicated by
shovel testing suggested no real potential that backhoe trenches would yield any further information.
Instead, it was decided that a denser layout of shovel tests had a better potential to both delineate any
disturbed resources and note any possible pockets of deeper soils (possibly requiring a backhoe). Only
the materials described in the site description below were identified, and no soils with depths meriting
backhoe work were encountered.

According to TARL site forms, 41WM432 is a prehistoric site of undetermined age, measuring
approximately 200 by 90-m (295.27-ft). No diagnostic artifacts have been recovered from 41WM432 by
this or any previous surveys. The site sits on a low terrace of gray-tan silty loam over gravels and
bedrock. The eastern and central portions have been bladed to the gravels and less than 20-cm (7.87-in)
of soils remains. The portion of the site present within the current survey area is primarily between North
College Street and the San Gabriel River. Resources were only encountered near the west end of the area
(Figure 5). All identified resources were in severely eroded, truncated, and/or disturbed contexts.

Previous Investigations
The site was originally recorded in 1979 by Fox and Whitsett and was revisited and updated in 2002 by
AAG. At the time of the previous visits, it was described as a prehistoric site containing lithic artifacts,
burned rock, and snail shells (Whitsett and Fox 1979). These resources were noted in gray-tan silty clay
on gravel, located on a terrace adjacent the river (Whitsett and Fox 1979). A buried burned rock midden
exhibiting charcoal stained soil and containing lithic artifacts was also noted in a western portion of the
site (presumably further outside of the current survey area). It was also noted by Whitsett and Fox (1979)
that the âeastern area of the site had been bladed to gravels and therefore seriously disturbed.â An AAG
(Bradle 2002) survey also reviewed a small section south of the river for an irrigation pipeline. Bradle
reviewed 41WM432 during the survey and also concluded that only the western portion of the site had
any potential for intact deposits. The AAG survey recorded less than 20-cm (7.87-in) of soils present in
the central and eastern portions of 41WM432; these are the areas in closest proximity to the current
survey area. Based on the available data, no clear NRHP/SAL eligibility recommendations were made
during the past recordation.

Survey Results
A pedestrian survey with associated shovel tests was undertaken along three areas around the existing
College Street Bridge. A complete record of STs is included in Appendix B. All three areas are located
within the approximate site boundaries of 41WM432 as plotted by Bradle (2002).
South Area
The south area was (3 to 5-ft) 0.91 to 1.52-m higher than the area north of College Street. Portions of this
area have been elevated with fill, but it has overall been heavily impacted by the construction of City of
Georgetown offices and facilities. Those areas that have likely been raised by fill are outside the aci
survey area (to the south). A single transect was placed along the south side of North College Street to
investigate this area. This was located 10-m (32.8-ft) south of College Street (Figures 5).
STs contained uniform, compact, very dark brown silty sand designated as 10YR3/2 to 4/2. The tests
averaged 60 to70-cm (23.62 to 27.56-in) deep and were terminated after encountering sterile, compacted
sub-soils (Figure 6). All investigations in this area were negative. Although the area further to the south
(along the gated drive to the city facilities and land fill) was also part of the overall APE, it was not shovel
tested due to the presence of a city refueling depot and buried fuel lines and tanks. Pedestrian survey in
the location identified no indications of surface artifacts or features.
East Area
The east area is located immediately east of the existing low water bridge (Figure 5). STs revealed
uniform, dark grayish-brown sandy soils designated as 10YR4/2 on the Munsell color chart. Past clearing
and blading has resulted in shallow soils and exposed bedrock in places. Typically, STs suggested that
soils are less than 20-cm (7.87-in) deep. The location currently serves as a picnic and smoking area for
the city offices to the south. There is also a gravel road just inside the southern boundary of the APE in
this area. No cultural materials were noted in any of the STs excavated within this area.
West Area
The west survey area was located between College Street and the San Gabriel River, from existing bridge
to the western terminus of Walden Street (Figure 5). This area was severely impacted by disturbances
associated with park and road construction.
This portion of the survey was divided into four transects and STs were placed approximately 20-m
(65.62-ft) apart along the transects. The soils in this area were sandy clay loam, dark brown to dark
grayish-brown in color (designated as 10 YR 2/2 or 4/2 on the Munsell soil color chart) with heavy
limestone gravels. The soils appeared to be unconsolidated in nature. In some locations, it was mostly
comprised of modern fill on an eroded/bedrock surface. STs averaged 10 to 30-cm (3.94 to 11.81-in) in
depth; these were then terminated at dense (bedrock derived) gravels or bedrock (Figure 6).
Twelve STs in this area contained prehistoric cultural material (nine of these were delineations off three
original, positive transect tests). The specific prehistoric artifacts were recovered at the extreme western
end of transects 1, 2, and 3. They consisted primarily of tertiary and thinning flakes, all of local chert,
and appear to represent the deflated eastern edge of 41WM432. The tests also often demonstrated direct
association with modern trash. The trash was noted in association with the prehistoric resources in STs 7,
8, 11a, 11b, and 11c of Transect 1; STs 1, 2, 3, 4, 7e, 12, and 13 of Transect 2; and STs 3 of Transect 3
(see Appendix B). Artifacts identified were confined to the upper 10 to 20-cm (3.94 to 7.87-in) of the
shovel tests. The combination of both modern trash and prehistoric artifacts within the same elevations of
excavated STs demonstrates a lack of contextual integrity for the artifacts.

Material Culture
Artifacts identified from 41WM432 included prehistoric materials in association with a mix of modern
trash. Prehistoric artifacts included non-diagnostic lithics (Table 3; Plates 11, 12, and 13). As noted
previously, these materials were mixed in shallow and disturbed soils. Recent materials were primarily
modern container glass, most likely for beer and soda.

NRHP Evaluation
Although limited prehistoric materials were identified near the western edge of the aci survey area, these
were encountered in a deflated context where cultural materials were mixed with modern trash
immediately over bedrock. All artifacts also represented functionally and temporally non-diagnostic
lithic materials that add minimal information to our knowledge of the prehistoric occupation of the region
(beyond simply establishing that a prehistoric occupation was present). As such, it is recommended that
the portion of the site investigated also retains only minimal information potential; therefore, it is
recommended the portion of 41WM432 within the survey area is not NRHP or SAL eligible. However, it
must be further stressed that additional resources were plotted by Bradle (2002) further to the west and
south in areas that were excluded from aciâs survey (outside the current APE). Since the overall site
could not be assessed, it is further recommended that the resources identified by aci specifically be
considered a non-contributing element to the overall eligibility of 41WM432. Lacking information on the
remainder of the site, an eligibility recommendation for the site as a whole cannot be made at this time.

Treatment Recommendations
Based on the available data, aci recommends the portion of 41WM432 within the survey area lacks
integrity and substantial information potential. These remains would not be considered NRHP or SAL
eligible (if these remains comprised the entire site). Since the entire site was not investigated, it is
recommended the portion surveyed represents a non-contributing element to any eligibility that the larger
site might possess. As the identified resources within the survey area lack integrity, it is recommended
the proposed undertaking will have no effect on known NRHP or SAL eligible archeological historic
properties. Provided the undertaking does not go outside the boundaries of the area surveyed, no further
work is recommended. However, if impacts were to extend outside of this location to the west, additional
investigations would be merited to further clarify the extents and NRHP/SAL eligibility of 41WM432.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Between October 29, and October 30, 2007, with a revisit on Feb. 6, 2008, archeologists from aci
conducted intensive survey of the proposed College Street Bridge Replacement Project within San
Gabriel Park in Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas. Overall, the results of the aci survey identified
extensive soil truncation and/or disturbance throughout the survey area on both sides of the San Gabriel
River. Shovel testing and auger testing encountered bedrock and/or gravels at shallow depths; road
gravels were noted in some of the residual soils as well. Intensive pedestrian survey, prior to shovel and
auger testing, also identified extensive areas of mechanical modification and landscaping that have
leveled and truncated soils in the overall survey area. Although limited prehistoric artifacts mixed with
modern trash (41WM432) were noted near the western edge of the survey area (south of the San Gabriel
River), these resources were identified in disturbed contexts that lack integrity; they are also located
immediately over shallow bedrock.
Based on the available data, aci recommends the portion of 41WM432 within the current survey area
south of the San Gabriel River lacks the integrity and information potential necessary for NRHP or SAL
eligibility. These portions of 41WM432 are in an area that has been severely affected by erosion and
modern development. The soils are extremely truncated and indicate a high degree of disturbance. The
presence of modern debris, including glass fragments located in the same context as the few prehistoric
artifacts also suggest a complete lack of vertical integrity. Therefore, aci recommends that portion of the
site within the current survey area be considered a non-contributing element to the eligibility of the
remaining portion of 41WM432. Since the portion of 41WM432 located further to the south and west is
on lands not accessible for the current survey, the potential for resources in that location cannot be
assessed; however, an overall eligibility recommendation for the site cannot be made at this time. The
above recommendation applies only to the portion of 41WM432 within the current survey area.
Survey results in the reminder of the survey area north and south of the San Gabriel River, as noted
above, also documented extensive modern modifications, plus truncated and deflated soils. This again
suggests no potential for intact resources. As such, no further work is recommended for the remainder of
the survey area (outside 41WM432) as well.
In summary, the results of the present survey demonstrate the proposed bridge replacement and
improvements are located on an eroded and modified landscape that has been further impacted by modern
development on both the north and south sides of the San Gabriel River. Based on the results of the
survey, no further archeological investigations are recommended for the proposed College Street Bridge
project, provided future construction activities do not deviate from the defined limits of the APE and
associated survey area. If confined to this area, it is recommended the proposed undertaking will have no
effect on any known NRHP or SAL eligible archeological historic properties. However, in the event
subsurface archeological deposits are encountered during construction, work in the immediate area should
cease immediately. TxDOT archeological staff should then be contacted in order to initiate accidental
discovery procedures under the provisions of the Programmatic Agreement (PA) between TxDOT, the
Texas Historical Commission (THC), The City of Georgetown, and the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation and the Memorandum of Understanding between TxDOT and THC.
