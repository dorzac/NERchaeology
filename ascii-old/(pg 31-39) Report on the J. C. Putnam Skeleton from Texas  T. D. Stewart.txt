Report on J. C. Putnam Skeleton From Texas

REPORT ON J. C. PUTNAM SKELETON
FROM TEXAS
BY T. D. STEWART
This skeleton was found upon receipt to consist of an incomplete
skull, all of the long bones more or less complete, such bones as
the innominates, scapulae and vertebrae in fragments, and many of
the smaller bones in good condition.

Some repairs had already

been made and all the parts had been treated with a hardening solution.

The bones are dark brown in color, but become a light brown

when brushed with acetone.

The weight of the individual bones is

about average, thus suggesting freedom from mineralization.
characters clearly indicate a male.

Sex

Age changes, especially in the

pubic symphysis, are comparable with an age of about 40 years.
Since the skull is most useful in establishing relationships, an
effort was made to reassemble the parts.

This necessitated cer-

tain assumptions, chiefly because all connection between the upper alveolus and the base of the skull proper, except through
the mandible, had been lost.

These assumptions include the length

of the nose (53 ram.) and face (76 ram.) and the distance between
the alveolar point and basion (102 ram). The figures used for this
purpose approximate the averages for male Texas crania given by
Hrdlicka.~ The two views shown in figure 1 indicate the reasonablehess of the reconstruction arrived at in this manner.
The reconstructed skull was next oriented in the Frankfort position on the Schwartz stereograph and a drawing made of the norma
verticalis (fig. 2). Assuming this skull to have been symmetrical,
the missing left side was restored in the drawing by mirroring the
right side. This procedure was aided by the fact that three landmarks in the median plane are preserved; namely, nasion, bregma,
and basion. The missing occiput was next drawn in freehand to
represent extreme but reasonable dolichocrany. According to this
reconstructed norma verticalis, the maximum length did not likely
exceed 185 mm and the maximum breadth 135 ram. The cranial

index thus would be about 73, with the error being probably on
the side of dolichocrany.
The following measurements obtained on this skull are regarded
as accurate:
Basion-bregma height ........................................ 142 mm
Biporionic vertical height ................................ 118 mm
Basion-nasion

.................................................... 102 mm

Diameter frontal minimum .............................. 97 mm
Nasal width ........................................................ 27 mm
Bigonial diameter .............................................. 1.13 mm
The only significant index derived from these measurements is the
Mean Height Index.

This is figured on the basis of the reconstruc-

tion to be 88.8, which indicates a relatively high head.

It should be mentioned that the teeth of this skull are extremely
worn, so that there was some difficulty in securing a good articulation between the jaws.
only two lower incisors.

An interesting anomaly is the presence of
Presumably the lateral incisors are the

missing ones. There is also a small ear exostosis in the one auditory
meatus present.
Unfortunately, the skulls collected earlier by Dr. Cyrus N. Ray
in this same r~gion and deposited in the National Museum (Hrdlicka,
1938) are not at present available for visual comparison. Because
of the earlier danger of air raids, these valuable specimens were
evacuated from Washington and have not yet been hrought back.

Evidently, however, the J. C. Putnam skull is not so long-headed,.
although equally high-headed.
The long bones sufficiently well preserved for study yield the following measurements:

Stature is estimated at 166 era, or about 5â 5".

The humeri do not have septa! apertures; the right femur has a
medium sized third trochanter (left?). In view of Hrdlickaâs earlier

38

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

observations2 that other tibia from this region are almost invariably
quadrilateral in cross ~ction at the middle, it is of interest to point
out that the pre~nt specimens likewise show this feature (Plate 8).
Hrdlicka had made an extensive study of this subject and there is
every reason to believe that he was correct in pointing out the unusual frequency of quadrilateral tibia in the skeletons from this
region. He explained this finding on the basis of a peculiar function
and fell back upon the Lamarckian viewpoint that the results of this
function had become hereditary. Any such explanation must be
regarded as speculative at the present time. It seems more important
to note that Hrdlickaâs unpublished data show the quadrilateral
l.ibia to be the most common type among all American Indians.
It would appear from these observations that the J. C. Putnam
skeleton presents no unusual features setting it apart from other
remains of known American Indians from this region. Being relatively long-headed and high-headed, the skull could have belonged,
so far as our present knowledge goes, to an early type of Indian.
However, it is impossible to establish the antiquity of this individual
on the basis of the bones alone.
