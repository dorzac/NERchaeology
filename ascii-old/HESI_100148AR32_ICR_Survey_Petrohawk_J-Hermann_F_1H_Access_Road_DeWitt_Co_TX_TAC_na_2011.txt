ABSTRACT

On 7 September 2011, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of Petrohawk Energy Corporation’s (PEC) proposed JHermann F 1H access road right-of-way (ROW) in northern DeWitt County, Texas. The
proposed access road ROW measures 0.9 miles (1.4 kilometers [km]) in length and 50.0 feet
(15.2 meters [m]) wide, with an overall area of 5.3 acres. Although the proposed access road
ROW will be located entirely on private property and will be constructed with private funds, its
construction will require coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA). As a result, the undertaking falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Horizon conducted the cultural
resources survey of the proposed access road ROW on behalf of PEC in compliance with
Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if the construction of the
proposed access road had the potential to have an adverse impact on any significant cultural
resources considered to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP).
The cultural resources survey resulted in the reassessment of portions of 2 previously
recorded prehistoric archeological sites (41DW87 and 41DW88) that are traversed by the
proposed access road ROW. Recorded in the early 1970s, site 41DW87 was documented as a
prehistoric open campsite with an undetermined NRHP eligibility status, and site 41DW88 was
documented as a prehistoric quarry recommended as ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
Horizon’s investigations found the cultural deposits of both sites within the limits of the currently
proposed access road ROW to be both shallow and ephemeral. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the portions of sites 41DW87 and 41DW88 within the proposed access road ROW are
noncontributing elements to the overall NRHP eligibility status of each site and that no additional
investigations are warranted within the proposed access road ROW.
Based on the assessment that the portions of sites 41DW87 and 41DW88 within the
proposed access road ROW are considered to be noncontributing elements to the overall NRHP
eligibility status of each site, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of PEC’s proposed JHermann F 1H access road will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources.
Horizon therefore recommends that PEC be allowed to proceed with the construction of the
proposed access road, relative to the jurisdiction of FEMA and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial

features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the proposed access road, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
and FEMA should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of Petrohawk
Energy Corporation’s (PEC) proposed J-Hermann F 1H access road right-of-way (ROW) in
northern DeWitt County, Texas (Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The proposed access road ROW
measures 0.9 miles (1.4 kilometers [km]) in length and 50.0 feet (15.2 meters [m]) wide, with an
overall area of 5.3 acres. Although the proposed access road ROW will be located entirely on
private property and will be constructed with private funds, its construction will require
coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). As a result, the
undertaking falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the
proposed access road ROW on behalf of PEC in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if the construction of the proposed access road had
the potential to have an adverse impact on any significant cultural resources considered to be
eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the proposed access road ROW, and the production of a report
suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the
Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27,
and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s
Principal Investigator, while Michael Mudd and Jared Wiersema (Horizon staff archeologists)
conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the proposed access road ROW on 7 September 2011.
This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts within the
boundaries of the proposed access road ROW. The Texas State Minimum Archeological
Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects
measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the proposed access road ROW measures 0.9 miles
(1.4 km) in length and only 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide, a total of 7 shovel tests were necessary
along the proposed access road ROW in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded
the TSMASS by excavating a total of 25 shovel tests along the proposed access road ROW.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

PEC’s proposed J-Hermann F 1H access road ROW is located in northern DeWitt
County, Texas (see Figures 1-1 and 1-2). It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS)
7.5-minute Hochheim, Texas, topographic quadrangle map (see Figure 1-1). The total area of
potential effect (APE) for the project consists of an access road ROW measuring 4610.0 feet
(1405.1 m) in length and 50.0 feet (15.2 m) in width, with an overall area of 5.3 acres. The
construction of the proposed access road will serve to provide access to the existing J-Hermann
F 1H well pad from Country Road (CR) 237, approximately 3.0 miles (4.8 km) southwest of
Hochheim, Texas. The western end of the proposed access road ROW initiates on a small
ridgeline just above the floodplain of the Guadalupe River. From there, it winds to the east
along the route of an existing 2-track road that extends upward in elevation into an area of
dissected ridgelines east of the Guadalupe River. Its eastern extent terminates within an area
of several mapped gravel pits (see Figure 1-1). Representative images of the proposed access
road ROW at the time of the cultural resource survey are presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-4.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed access road ROW is located in northern DeWitt County in South Texas.
This vast majority of the proposed ROW extends along an existing 2-track road that winds
through rangeland and chaparral typical of South Texas. Elevations along the length of the
proposed ROW range between approximately 220.0 feet (67.1 m) and 320.0 feet (97.5 m)
above mean sea level. Hydrologically, the proposed ROW is situated within the Guadalupe
River basin. The proposed ROW drains to the west via overland sheet flow directly into the
Guadalupe River, which is located approximately 1,400.0 feet (426.7 m) west of the western
end of the proposed ROW.

2.3

CLIMATE

The climate in DeWitt County is humid subtropical with a considerable range of annual
temperature extremes. Winters are generally mild with temperatures falling below 32.0 degrees
only 25 days a year on average. The summer months are commonly hot and humid with
average daily temperatures around 95.0 degrees. The average annual total precipitation is
about 33.2 inches (NRCS 2011a).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The proposed ROW is located in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province (WWF 2005) and the
South Texas Plains vegetational region (Gould 1975). The upland areas support a rich tapestry
of south Texas chaparral. The vegetation of the undeveloped and uncleared areas can be
characterized as brush country, with variably dense scrub ranging in height from 4.0 to 10.0
feet. Mesquite and associated thorny shrubs, such as catclaw acacia, huisache, blackbrush,
granjeno, whitebrush, prickly pear, and Spanish dagger are common locally. Understory
vegetation is characteristically sparse. Along major drainages, live oak, Texas sugarberry,
cedar elm, and retama occur. Little bluestem, bristlegrass, paspalums, windmill grass, and
buffelgrass are dominant grasses.
The Tamaulipan/Mezquital ecoregion of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico has
unique plant and animal communities containing tree- and brush-covered dunes, wind tidal flats,
and dense native brushland (WWF 2005). Although there are large acreages of cultivated land
on the South Texas Plains, most of the area is still rangeland. Land holdings predominantly are
large cattle ranches. Deer and other wildlife species are common. This area originally
supported a grassland or savannah type climax vegetation. Long continued grazing and other
factors have altered the plant communities to such a degree that ranchmen of the region now
face a severe brush problem (Gould 1975).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The prehistory of South Texas can essentially be divided into 3 major periods: (1)
Paleoindian (9200–6000 BC); (2) Archaic, which has been subdivided into the Early Archaic (ca.
6000–2500 BC), Middle Archaic (ca. 2500–400 BC), and Late Archaic (ca. 400 BC–AD 800);
and (3) Late Prehistoric (AD 800–1600). These prehistoric periods are principally defined by the
presence of particular diagnostic projectile points, but they are intended to designate general
cultural patterns based on ecology, technology, and subsistence strategies (Black 1989:48-57;
Suhm et al. 1954).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 9200–6000 BC)

Evidence of Paleoindian occupations in South Texas (9200–6000 BC) usually consists
of surface finds found most frequently in the Nueces-Guadalupe and Rio Grande plains. Only 2
stratified Paleoindian sites have been excavated in the region: Buckner Ranch (Sellards 1940)
and Berger Bluff (Brown 1987). Both sites were deeply buried in alluvial terraces. Diagnostic
projectile point styles of the Paleoindian period include Clovis (Meltzer 1986), Folsom (Largent
et al. 1991), Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura (Black 1989:48-49). Finely flaked end
scrapers fashioned on blades and bifacially worked Clear Fork tools are also diagnostic of the
Paleoindian period. Paleoindian peoples have traditionally been characterized as terminal
Pleistocene big-game hunters, but these highly mobile hunter-gatherers probably exploited a
rich diversity of wild plant and animal foods. Investigations at Baker Cave, for instance, indicate
that a diverse array of fish, snakes, and rodents was exploited by the Paleoindian occupants
(Hester 1983). Paleoindian populations were probably organized into small groups that ranged
over great distances across periglacial plains and marginally forested areas to acquire different
food sources throughout the year (Black 1989:48).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 6000 BC–AD 800)

The major distinction of the Early Archaic period (6000–2500 BC) is the replacement of
earlier lanceolate-shaped projectile points by stemmed and corner-notched types. These styles
include Bell, Andice, Early Triangular, and Early Expanding Stemmed points such as Bandy,
Martindale, Uvalde, and related forms (Turner and Hester 1999). Other diagnostic artifacts
include Clear Fork tools and large, thin, triangular bifaces with concave bases. The beginning of
the Early Archaic period marks the onset of the modern Holocene era, during which the

HJN 100148 AR 32

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

periglacial climate of the late Pleistocene began to grow warmer. Available evidence from the
Gulf Coastal Plain suggests that population densities remained low through the beginning of the
Archaic period in South Texas, reflecting a continuation of the highly mobile adaptations of the
Paleoindian period.
The Middle Archaic period (2500–400 BC) in South Texas is defined by the presence of
Pedernales, Langtry, Kinney, Bulverde, and Tortugas projectile point styles (Bell 1958; Turner
and Hester 1999). Distally beveled tools are also common during this period, and ground stone
tools, such as tubular grinding stones and manos, appear for the first time (Black 1989:49). Site
densities in South Texas increase markedly during the Middle Archaic, possibly reflecting a
decrease in group mobility and/or an increase in territoriality among groups (Black 1989:51). A
heavier reliance on vegetal foods may be indicated by the introduction of ground stone
technology and the appearance of large burned rock middens throughout Central Texas.
Late Archaic (400 BC–AD 800) occupations in South Texas are defined by small cornerand side­notched dart points, including Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Fairland, and Ellis types (Bell 1958,
1960; Turner and Hester 1999). Site densities continue to increase throughout the Late Archaic
period, possibly indicating that population densities continued to rise. Cultural deposits on Late
Archaic sites also tend to be deeper than during preceding periods, suggesting that occupations
were either more extended in duration or that reoccupation of the same locations was more
frequent (Black 1989:51). Cemeteries appear during this period, possibly indicating higher levels
of social organization and increasing territoriality (Black 1989:51). During the Late Archaic, the
exploitation of different ecological niches continued to intensify, becoming increasingly oriented
toward the exploitation of seasonal food sources. This kind of adaptation is best illustrated by
the frequent occurrence of shell middens along the coast and burned rock middens farther
inland. Data collected from inland sites indicate that the economy was based primarily on
vegetal resources supplemented with the hunting of small game such as rodents and rabbits
(Black 1989:51).

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 800–1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period is defined by the appearance of pottery and the
bow and arrow. The small dart points of the Late Archaic period were largely replaced by arrow
points (Black 1989:52). The Late Prehistoric period in South Texas has been divided into 2
distinct time horizons, the Austin (AD 800–1350) and Toyah (AD 1350–1600) phases (Black
1986). The Austin phase is characterized by the presence of Scallorn arrow points, while the
Toyah phase is defined by the presence of Perdiz arrow points. Faunal resources became
increasingly important during this period, especially large mammals such as bison and deer.
Lithic tool kits seem to have been manufactured for the processing of large mammals (Black
1989:51-57). Late Prehistoric sites are relatively common throughout South Texas, which might
be interpreted as the result of population increases. The movement of bison from Central to
South Texas may coincide with a movement of peoples and/or technology from both the Austin
and Toyah phases of Central Texas (Black 1989:51-57).

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. AD 1520 TO PRESENT)

The historic era of South Texas began with the arrival of Europeans in the region and
can be subsumed within the overall history of Texas. In South Texas, the historic era has been
divided into 3 time periods: (1) Spanish Exploration and Colonial (ca. AD 1520–1821); (2)
Mexican (1821-1836); and (3) Texas-American (ca. 1836 to present). The Protohistoric era in
this region can generally be incorporated within the early part of the Spanish Exploration and
Colonial period.
Protohistoric
Records from the initial Spanish expeditions provide the earliest ethnohistoric accounts
of the Coahuiltecan-affiliated groups indigenous to the Rio Grande Plain (Hester 1989a:1-4;
1989b:77-82). Based on fragmentary ethnohistorical records, it appears that these people—part
of an extinct cultural group that occupied lands stretching from South Texas deep into Mexico—
were highly nomadic hunter­gatherers who moved in a seasonal pattern within distinctive
territories (Hester 1989a). Available evidence suggests that Coahuiltecans living in the Rio
Grande Plain (as well as in other parts of South Texas and northern Mexico) subsisted on a
number of seasonal food sources, ranging from prickly pear in the fall to bison or deer in the late
fall or winter, as well as small mammals and roots during off­seasons or in times of hardship
(Hester 1989b:77-81).
Two causes can be cited for the early destruction of the Coahuiltecan groups on the Rio
Grande plain. The primary reason stems from the great period of unrest among Native
American groups generated by the introduction of the horse by the Spanish. Groups who
adopted the horse (especially the Apache and the Comanche) eagerly took to raiding
neighboring groups. Nomadic peoples such as the Coahuiltecans were especially vulnerable to
such pressure, as they could neither consolidate for protection nor occupy defensible positions
without risking starvation. Therefore, finally, the Coahuiltecans asked for missions to be
established in their territories in order to protect them from the Apache and Comanche raiders.
After the establishment of the Spanish missions in South Texas during the first half of the 18th
century, the remnants of the indigenous Native American groups were rapidly integrated into the
mission system or were subjected to outright extinction by depredation or disease (John
1975:171-174).
Spanish Colonial
The first European incursion into Texas was by Alvarez de Pineda in 1513 during the
course of a Spanish mapping expedition. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after
being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay (Folan et al. 1989:85). Between
1688 and 1717, Spanish explorers such as Mazanet and Espinosa passed through the Rio
Grande Plain from Mexico on their way to the Caddoan settlements in northeast Texas (Hester
1989b:80-81). These early Spanish explorers recorded observations about the aboriginal
groups in the region, but they were primarily engaged in consolidating territory for the Spanish
Crown.

Following the founding of San Antonio in 1718, the town of Laredo was established
along the Rio Grande in 1755 when rancher Tomas Sanchez de la Berrera y Gallardo was
granted permission by the great Spanish colonizer, Jose de Escandon, to form a new
settlement. Located in the province of Nuevo Santander, which included most of northeastern
Mexico and parts of present-day Texas, Laredo was one of a series of settlements that
Escandon established or authorized as part of Spain’s effort to colonize the area south of the
Nueces River (Clark and Juarez 1986:85; Folan et aI. 1986:6).
Mexican and Texas-American
Prior to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, a Spanish garrison was established in Laredo
to minimize the effects of depredations by Lipan Apache and Comanche raiders. In 1790, a
daring attack on the city overran the garrison and exploded the powder magazine, deepening
fears “that the Comanches’ efforts to sweep through south Texas were succeeding” (Briggs
1982:7). Once the Texas-Mexico border was established along the Rio Grande in 1848, the role
of protection in the Laredo area passed to the United States. In 1849, a company of mounted
infantry under 2nd Lieutenant E.L. Viele arrived to establish an army post on “some high flats
west of the city, opposite a ford and just north of a bend in the Rio Grande” (Briggs 1982:7) on
the Texas side of the river about 3/4ths of a mile west of the old Spanish town of Laredo.
Originally named Camp Crawford (or Camp Laredo), the name of the post was changed in 1850
to Fort McIntosh in honor of Lieutenant Colonel James S. McIntosh, who died in September
1847 from wounds received at the Battle of Molino del Rey during the Mexican-American War
(Frazer 1972). When construction began in 1850, the general military objective of the Fort was
to provide “escort service to caravans of travelers and [to reduce] Indian depredations and
general outlawry” (Briggs 1982:8).

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of 13 previously recorded archeological site and 1
NRHP district within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the proposed access road ROW, while a
review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer also indicated the
presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (THC 2011;
NPS 2011). These cultural resources and their distances from the proposed ROW are
summarized in Table 4-1, while their locations relative to the proposed ROW are presented in

General location
of proposed
ROW

Figure 4-1. Location of documented cultural resources within 1.0 miles of proposed ROW
Although not mapped on the Atlas maps, the majority of the previously recorded
archeological sites within the review radius were recorded in the early 1970s during what
appears to have been an extensive cultural resources survey undertaken in anticipation of the
construction of the Cuero Reservoir, a project that has yet to come to fruition.
The entire length of the proposed access road ROW is located within the Cuero I
Archeological District, an extensive area that is listed on the NRHP. Based on the Atlas maps,
this area covers approximately 350.0 square miles and extends 45.0 miles (72.4 km) along the
Guadalupe River. This extensive district encompasses hundreds of archeological sites ranging
in age from PaleoIndian up through historic Anglo American settlement and is not reflective of
the actual limits of specific archeological sites.
Of the 13 previously recorded archeological sites within the review perimeter, 2 are
traversed by the proposed ROW (see Figure 4-1). Site 41DW87 was documented as a large
prehistoric campsite situated along the top of a heavily eroded sandy clay terrace overlooking
the Guadalupe River. While the site recorders indicated that this site is heavily disturbed, they
went on to recommend it for additional testing investigations. As such, its NRHP eligibility

16

Access Road in DeWitt County, Texas

status is considered to be undetermined. Site 41DW88 was documented as a prehistoric quarry
located on the slope of a gravel terrace overlooking the Guadalupe River. Due to the
sparseness of lithic materials and the shallow, rocky nature of the site, the recorders
recommended no additional investigations on this site. As such, it is considered to be ineligible
for inclusion on the NRHP.
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the proposed
access road ROW on elevated landforms above the Guadalupe River, coupled within the
presence of numerous previously recorded prehistoric sites within the review perimeter (2 of
which are located within the limits of the proposed ROW), it was Horizon’s original opinion that
there existed a high potential for additional undocumented prehistoric cultural resources at
select locations along the proposed ROW.
In regard to historic-era resources, no structures are visible in proximity to the proposed
ROW on the relevant topographic quadrangle map. This suggested a decreased potential for
undocumented historic-era standing structures within the proposed ROW.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the proposed access road ROW on 7 September 2011. This entailed intensive surface
inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts along the proposed ROW. The TSMASS
require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on linear projects measuring 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
in width. As the proposed access road ROW measures 0.9 miles (1.4 km) in length and 50.0
feet (15.2 m), a total of 7 shovel tests were necessary to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon
exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating a total of 25 shovel tests along the
proposed ROW. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.0-millimeter [mm])
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. If any new archeological sites were recorded, standard site forms were to
be completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for permanent
housing. Similarly, if any previously recorded archeological sites were assessed, updated site
forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility or
for return to the appropriate landowner. Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and
assessed in the field and placed back where they were found. Digital photographs with a photo
log were completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via
handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum. Shovel
test locations are presented in Figure 5-1. Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the proposed access road ROW resulted in the
reassessment of 2 previously recorded prehistoric archeological sites (41DW87 and 41DW88;
Figure 6-1). These sites are described separately below.

6.1

SITE 41DW87

General Description
Site 41DW87 is a large prehistoric campsite that was originally recorded by Daniel Fox
in 1973 during the survey for the then-proposed Cuero Reservoir (see Figure 6-1). The site is
described as being situated along the top of a heavily eroded sandy clay terrace, measuring
200.0 m (656.2 feet) north-south by 50.0 m (164.0 feet) east-west, that was once a plowed field
and probably bulldozed. Cultural materials observed at the time of the site’s original recording
included chert flakes/chips and 1 thin biface. Although Fox noted that the site is very badly
disturbed, he did recommend additional testing investigations on it. As such, its NRHP eligibility
status was considered to be undetermined for the current survey efforts.
The currently proposed access road extends from the northwest to the southeast across
the central portion of site 41DW87 (Figure 6-2; see also Figure 6-1). Horizon’s investigations
found the site to be similar to the original documentation, consisting of a grass, huisache, and
mesquite covered terrace approximately 300.0 m (984.3 feet) east of the Guadalupe River
(Figure 6-3). The dense vegetation across the site provided minimal surface exposure (10%),
and as a result, no surface cultural materials were observed. However, the field crew did
identify several visible “push piles” on the site, confirming Fox’s original assessment that the site
has been bulldozed at some point in the past. The owner of the property met shortly with the
field crew and indicated that the site has been “picked over” for generations.
As dense vegetation obscured the site’s surface, the field crew excavated a total of 6
shovel tests along the length of the proposed access road across the site to assess the site’s
subsurface deposits. Of the 6 excavated tests, 5 consisted of typical shovel tests measuring
30.1 x 30.1 centimeters (cm) (1.0 x 1.0 foot), while 1 of the tests was excavated as a 50.0 x 50.0
cm (1.6 x 1.6 feet) unit to more thoroughly assess the site’s subsurface deposits (Figure 6-4).
Only 2 of the excavated shovel tests produced any evidence of shallow, subsurface cultural
material. As these tests were only excavated within the limits of the proposed access road
ROW, the previously recorded portions of the site to the north and south were not assessed.

Access Road in DeWitt County, Texas

Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41DW87 consist solely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. These include 5 pieces of lithic debitage recovered from 2 of the 6 shovel tests
excavated along the proposed access road ROW across the site. One tertiary flake and 1
secondary flake were recovered from the upper 10.0 cm (3.9 inches) of the 50.0 x 50.0 cm (1.6
x 1.6 feet) test unit (DW87-1), while 1 burned chert flake was recovered between 0 and 10.0 cm
(0 and 3.9 inches) in shovel test DW87-3, and 2 burned chert flakes were recovered between
10.0 and 20.0 cm (3.9 and 7.9 inches) in the same test. Aside from these 5 lithic specimens, no
other cultural materials were recovered from the other shovel tests on the site or observed on
the site’s surface.
Cultural Features
No evidence of cultural features was observed on the surface of the site or within any of
the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site. However, the recovery of the burned chert flakes from
shovel test DW87-2 does suggest the presence of fire on the site at some point during its
history. It remains undetermined whether the flakes were burned during the prehistoric
occupation of the site or at a later time.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
As the current investigations assessed only the portion of site 41DW87 within the limits
of the proposed access road ROW, the full horizontal extent of the site was not assessed.
However, the site was originally recorded over the extent of an elongated terrace measuring
approximately 200.0 m (656.2 feet) north-south by 50.0 m (164.0 feet) east-west.
The vertical extent of the site within the proposed access road ROW extends between
0.0 and 20.0 cm below surface (0.0 and 7.9 inches). This assessment is based on the recovery
of the 5 pieces of lithic debitage in 2 of the 6 excavated shovel tests. The upper 20.0 cm (7.9
inches) of soil on the site within the proposed ROW where the cultural materials were recovered
consisted of sandy loam underlain by sterile clay, coinciding with the description of Crockett
soils, 2 to 5% slopes, eroded (CsC2) that are mapped across the site (see Figure 2-5 and Table
2-1). Overall, the site’s cultural deposits within the proposed access road ROW are generally
shallow and are found only within the sandy loam mantle that extends across the site.
Summary
Site 41DW87 is a prehistoric campsite that was originally recorded in 1973. While the
original recorder of the site indicated that the site had been plowed and bulldozed, the site was
recommended for additional testing investigations to formally determine its NRHP eligibility
status. Horizon’s current investigations along the proposed access road ROW that extend
across the site found evidence of bulldozing that corroborated the assessment of the original
recorder. Horizon’s investigations also only found evidence of extremely sparse and shallow
cultural deposits, consisting of only 5 lithic specimens, within the limits of the proposed access
road ROW. As the site’s boundaries extend to the north and south well beyond the assessed
limits of the proposed access road ROW, the overall NRHP eligibility status for site 41DW87 is

HJN 100148 AR 32

25

Chapter 6.0: Results

still considered to be undetermined. However, based on the presence of only sparse and
shallow subsurface cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the portion of this site within the
proposed access road ROW is considered to be a noncontributing element to the overall NRHP
eligibility of the site and that no additional investigations are warranted within the proposed
ROW across this site.

6.2

SITE 41DW88

General Description
Site 41DW88 is a prehistoric quarry site that was originally recorded by Daniel Fox in
1973 during the survey for the then-proposed Cuero Reservoir (see Figure 6-1). The site is
described as being located on the slope of a gravel terrace overlooking the Guadalupe River to
the west. It is recorded as measuring 50.0 x 100.0 m (164.0 x 328.1 feet) with little vegetation
across the rocky slope. Observed cultural materials included chert core and flakes, and Fox
noted on the site form that “there is not a whole lot of flaking debris as compared to other
‘quarry’ sites.” Because of this, no additional investigations were recommended for this site
when it was originally recorded. As such, this was considered to be ineligible for inclusion on
the NRHP for the current survey efforts.
The currently proposed access road extends from the southwest to the northeast across
the northern extent of site 41DW88 and follows the route of an existing dirt road that traverses
the site (Figure 6-5; see also Figure 6-1). Horizon’s investigations found this dirt road to have
been extensively bulldozed in the past, with its sides lined by berms of the graded soil. While
the majority of the site is covered by dense grasses and stands of mesquite and huisache, the
dirt roadbed allowed for excellent surface visibility along the proposed access road ROW
through the site (Figure 6-6). This roadbed also revealed that the upland soils across the site
consist of shallow, gravelly clay with little potential to contain buried cultural deposits. As with
site 41DW87, the owner of the property informed the field crew that the surface of this site has
been “picked over” for generations.
Although the dirt road followed by the proposed access road ROW provided excellent
surface visibility across the site, the field crew excavated a total of 5 shovel tests along the
length of the proposed access road across the site to confirm the lack of potential for buried
cultural deposits. All 5 of the excavated tests produced negative results and revealed only
dense rocky clays across the site. As these tests were only excavated within the limits of the
proposed access road ROW, the previously recorded portions of the site to the north and south
were not assessed.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41DW88 consist solely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. These include 1 small bifacial chert core and 2 chert flakes recovered from the
surface of the proposed access road ROW across the site (Figure 6-7). Aside from these 3
lithic specimens, no other cultural materials were recovered from the shovel tests on the site or
observed on the site’s surface, suggesting an ephemeral utilization of the site.

Cultural Features
No evidence of cultural features was observed on the surface of the site or within any of
the 5 shovel tests excavated on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
As the current investigations assessed only the portion of site 41DW88 within the limits
of the proposed access road ROW, the full horizontal extent of the site was not assessed.
However, the site was originally recorded along a rocky slope measuring approximately 50.0 x
100.0 m (164.0 x 328.1 feet).
The site is situated within an upland erosional setting that lacks the potential for deeply
buried cultural deposits. As a result, the vertical extent of the site within the proposed access
road ROW appears to be confined strictly to surface contexts by the rocky, upland clay soils on
the site.
Summary
Site 41DW88 is a prehistoric quarry that was originally recorded in 1973. The original
recorder of the site indicated that the observed cultural materials were generally sparse as
compared to other quarry sites in the area, and, as such, recommended no additional
investigations on the site. Horizon’s current investigations along the proposed access road
ROW that extends across the site also found the cultural materials to be extremely sparse with
only 3 lithic specimens observed on the site’s surface and no evidence of subsurface deposits.
As the site’s boundaries extend to the north and south beyond the assessed limits of the
proposed access road ROW, the overall NRHP eligibility status for the site was not assessed,
even though it was originally documented as being ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
However, the surficial nature of the site’s cultural deposits, coupled with the observed grading of
the roadbed followed by the proposed access road ROW, clearly indicates that the portion of
site 41DW88 within the proposed access road ROW is a noncontributing element to the overall
NRHP eligibility of the site and that no additional investigations are warranted within the
proposed ROW across the site.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

On 7 September 2011, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of
PEC’s proposed J-Hermann F 1H access road ROW in northern DeWitt County, Texas. The
proposed access road ROW measures 0.9 miles (1.4 km) in length and 50.0 feet (15.2 m) wide,
with an overall area of 5.3 acres. Although the proposed access road ROW will be located
entirely on private property and will be constructed with private funds, its construction will
require coordination with FEMA. As a result, the undertaking falls under the regulations of
Section 106 of the NHPA. Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the proposed
access road ROW on behalf of PEC in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose
of the survey was to determine if the construction of the proposed access road had the potential
to have an adverse impact on any significant cultural resources considered to be eligible for
inclusion on the NRHP.
The cultural resources survey resulted in the reassessment of portions of 2 previously
recorded prehistoric archeological sites (41DW87 and 41DW88) that are traversed by the
proposed access road ROW. Recorded in the early 1970s, site 41DW87 was documented as a
prehistoric open campsite with an undetermined NRHP eligibility status, and site 41DW88 was
documented as a prehistoric quarry recommended as ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP.
Horizon’s investigations found the deposits of both sites within the limits of the currently
proposed access road ROW to be both shallow and ephemeral. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the portions of sites 41DW87 and 41DW88 within the proposed access road ROW are
noncontributing elements to the overall NRHP eligibility status of each site and that no additional
investigations are warranted within the proposed access road ROW.

7.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the assessment that the portions of sites 41DW87 and 41DW88 within the
proposed access road ROW are considered to be noncontributing elements to the overall NRHP
eligibility status of each site, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of PEC’s proposed JHermann F 1H access road will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources.
Horizon therefore recommends that PEC be allowed to proceed with the construction of the
proposed access road, relative to the jurisdiction of FEMA and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the proposed access road, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately and the THC and FEMA should be notified
of the discovery.
