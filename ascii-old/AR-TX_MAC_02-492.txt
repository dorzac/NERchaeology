ABSTRACT
On October 24, 27-28, and November 7-8, 2006, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.,
conducted a cultural resource survey investigation of a portion of the existing Peckinpaugh
Preserve and Greenbelt trail, in south Montgomery County, Texas. The objectives of the
investigation were to locate and identify cultural materials, sites, or historic properties within the
proposed impact area, and to prepare management recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations were conducted for the Montgomery County Parks Department,
under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4282.
An intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was conducted, and included both surface
and subsurface (shovel test) examination. A total of 34 shovel tests were excavated. Shovel tests
along the proposed trail route recovered an isolated find and identified and delineated a new site,
41MQ211. The single flake fragment identified as the isolated find was reburied near its point of
recovery after shovel testing was completed. The cultural materials recovered from site
41MQ211 were restricted to a small area, and consisted of chert flakes and flake fragments. The
artifacts’ wide vertical distribution (10-70 cmbs) suggests they are not associated with an intact or
stable remnant living surface. The limited number and types of recovered artifacts suggest the
encountered deposits represent either a small and ephemeral, short-term occupation site, or the
tests were located on the extreme edge of a larger occupation area.
The portion of the site included within the current trail APE appears to represent ephemeral, lowdensity cultural deposits that would offer little potential for yielding new information.
Consequently, no further work is recommended within the current APE. However, should any
impacts be planned for outside the current APE, additional archeological investigations will be
required to more accurately determine the boundaries and nature of the prehistoric site. Once the
current report is finalized, the recovered artifacts will be curated at TARL
The THC review of the survey findings determined that the project could proceed as planned, and
noted that the “site is buried between levels two and seven (20-70 cm bs) and should be preserved
and protected until it can be fully assessed for significance” (THC letter, dated February 20,
2007). The review also stipulated that the “county must periodically monitor this site location for
erosion and/or disturbances,” and stated that “if artifacts are exposed at any time, this short trail
segment should be closed to the public and additional investigations will be warranted.”
In the event that archeological deposits or features should be encountered in other areas during
construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission contacted for further consultation

INTRODUCTION
(the old Riley Fuzzel Road). This area
formed the approach to the Riley Fuzzel
Road bridge (which was removed when the
new Riley Fuzzel Road was built 400 ft
downstream), and appears to have been
artificially raised with up to a meter of fill.
The Greenbelt-related improvements include
an approximately 6400 ft (ca. 2 km) long
circuitous trail segment extending southeast
along the northern bank of Spring Creek.
The proposed trails follow extant informal
trails (created by ATVs or 4-wheelers) and
the planned construction impacts to these
areas will be superficial in nature.

On October 24, 27-28, and
November 7-8, 2006, Moore Archeological
Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural
resource survey investigation of a portion of
the existing Peckinpaugh Preserve and
Greenbelt trail, in south Montgomery
County, Texas.
The objectives of the
investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 0634) were conducted for the Montgomery
County Parks Department, under Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 4282.

Intensive pedestrian field surveys of
the project areas were conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (Figure 2; see
Appendix 1 for details). A total of 34 shovel
tests were excavated.
The field
investigations were conducted by project
archeologist Randy Ferguson and field
technician Kelly Schexnayder.
Roger
Moore served as the project’s principal
investigator.

The project area is depicted on the
Spring, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The proposed
improvements to Peckinpaugh Preserve
consist of a primitive park pavilion
(approximately 20 x 24 ft) and parking area
(approximately 100 x 150 ft), trail head,
canoe launch area, bicycle rack, and
interpretive signage. The majority of this
area is the location of an extant road surface

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Soils and Geology
Montgomery County is located
within the West Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic province (Hunt 1974). In the
Texas region, the surface topography of the
plain is characterized by relatively flat
topography that dips slightly towards the
Gulf of Mexico. Geologically, the project
area lies atop the Beaumont Formation, a
surface outcrop that extends from just east
of the Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

Climate
The modern climate of the
Montgomery County study area is
dominated by the Gulf of Mexico, resulting
in mild winters and hot and humid summers
(McClintock et al. 1972:67).
Summer
temperatures average 94°F (34°C), while
winter temperatures average 63°F (17°C).
Annual precipitation averages 47 inches
(119 cm).
Hydrology
The project areas are located along
the north side of Spring Creek, which forms
the boundary between Harris and
Montgomery Counties, and which is a major
tributary of the San Jacinto River.
Flora and Fauna
Montgomery County lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. The county is
situated within the pine-oak subdivision of
the Austroriparian province (Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the dominant floral species
of the pine-oak forest subdivision as loblolly
pine (Pinus taeda), yellow pine (Pinus
echinata), red oak (Quercus rubra), post oak
(Quercus stellata), and blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica). Hardwood forests
are found on lowlands within the
Austroriparian and are characterized by such
trees
as
sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia
grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), water
oak (Quercus nigra), and other species of
oaks, elms, and ashes, as well as the highly
diagnostic Spanish moss (Tillandisia
usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal glabra).

The project areas are depicted on
sheet 81 of the Soil Survey of Montgomery
County, Texas (McClintock et al. 1972).
The soil types identified in the project area
include Bruno loamy fine sand (Br)
immediately adjacent to the stream, and
Tuscumbia clay (Tu) and Albany fine sand
(Ab) in the upland areas. Bruno loamy fine
sand is described as excessively drained
(McClintock et al. 1972:10). Tuscumbia
clay is described as poorly drained soils that
form on stream floodplains (McClintock et
al. 1972:30). Albany fine sand is described
as somewhat poorly drained (McClintock et
al. 1972:7). Based on the PALM predictive
model developed by Abbott (2001), Bruno
soils are floodplain sandy recent alluvium,
while Tuscumbia soils are floodplain clayey
recent alluvium.
Both soil types are
considered to represent areas of high
potential for containing deeply buried
prehistoric sites. In contrast, Albany soils
are considered loamy ancient (preHolocene) alluvium, and are considered to
have a low potential for containing deeply
buried prehistoric sites.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),

Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant
subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a

1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated Narváez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Of the 12 sites (all prehistoric) identified in
this survey, five were located along Panther
Branch (41MQ70-41MQ74). The closest of
these is 41MQ74, which lies 0.65 km north
of the current project area.
This site
consisted of seven flakes and was described
as highly eroded.
While it was not
recommended for further work, two of the
Panther Branch sites (41MQ70, 41MQ73) to
its north were tested (Greiner Engineering
Sciences, Inc. 1981). One of the sites,
41MQ73, was determined to be considered
eligible for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places (Greiner
Engineering Sciences, Inc. 1981:17).

Prior
to
beginning
field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search
determined that no previously recorded
archeological sites are located within the
project area.
The closest previously
recorded site, 41MQ197, is located
approximately 300 m upstream from the
current project area, and just outside the
western boundary of the park. The site
represents a prehistoric occupation on a low
terrace along the creek’s northern bank
(TARL records). The site was recorded in
2002, and the observed artifacts included
chert debitage and ceramic sherds.
Although the deposits had been disturbed by
both natural erosion as well as human
impacts (horse and foot traffic, ATV trails)
shovel testing suggested site integrity
remained, and the site was recommended for
further testing.

In 1980, an initial survey of the
Jesse H. Jones Park tract along Spring Creek
was conducted (Heartfield, Price, and
Greene, Inc. 1980). Later, personnel from
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.
conducted additional survey for the Jesse H.
Jones Park expansion. Ten new sites were
recorded, eight prehistoric and two historic.
Only three of the prehistoric sites yielded
culturally diagnostic materials (Moore 1988;
Moore 1990). In additon, personnel from
Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc.
conducted a survey of the 334 acre
Burroughs Park Tract for Harris County,
Precinct #4. The project area was bordered
by Spring Creek and was subjected to
intensive shovel testing as well as historic
land-use and geomorphological studies.
Three prehistoric and one historic site were
identified during the course of survey
(Moore 1990).
One site, 41HR625,
produced a large number of artifacts. It was
considered
as
eligible
for
State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) status. The
other two prehistoric sites produced
evidence of more ephemeral occupations,
however they were also considered as
eligible for SAL status due to their excellent
state of preservation (Moore 1990).

A number of archeological surveys
have been conducted within the Spring
Creek
drainage.
An
avocational
archeologist, William McClure, recorded
sites 41MQ44 and 441MQ48 on Neidigk
Lake along Spring Creek. The sites were
revisited by personnel from the Texas
Archeological Survey in 1986 (Moore
1990). In 1979 a survey of the 23,000 acre
Woodlands residential development area
was conducted, and which appears to have
included the current project property
(Greiner Engineering Sciences, Inc. 1980).

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
ATV trails provided moderate to high levels
of ground surface visibility during the
survey.

The fieldwork was conducted on
October 24, 27-28, and November 7-8,
2006, and consisted of a 100% pedestrian
survey that included systematic shovel
testing and visual examination for surface
exposure of cultural materials.

A total of 34 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through ¼” mesh (Figure 2;
Appendix 1). Each of the project’s shovel
tests were recorded and plotted on the
project map. The general survey tests along
most of the proposed trail system were
placed at approximately 50 m intervals,
while tests used for site delineation were
spaced at 1-3 m intervals. On two long
sections of trail directly adjacent to the
current stream, much of the proposed route
consisted of areas containing clearly recent
deep sand flood deposits (Figure 5). In
these areas, surface exposures and nearby
visible cutbanks were visually examined, but
no shovel tests were excavated.

The project area is depicted on the
Spring, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figures 1, 2).
The
proposed improvements to Peckinpaugh
Preserve consist of a primitive park pavilion
(approximately 20 x 24 ft) and parking area
(approximately 100 x 150 ft), trail head,
canoe launch area, bicycle rack, and
interpretive signage. The majority of this
area is the location of an extant road surface
(the old Riley Fuzzel Road). This area
formed the approach to the Riley Fuzzel
Road bridge (which was removed when the
new Riley Fuzzel Road was built 400 ft
downstream), and appears to have been
artificially raised with up to a meter of fill.
Impacts in both areas will be shallow, and
limited to some grading and the application
of a layer of milled asphalt surfacing. The
Greenbelt-related improvements include an
approximately 6400 ft (ca. 2 km) long
circuitous trail segment contained within a
corridor extending 900 m southeast along
the northern bank of Spring Creek. The
proposed trails follow extant informal trails
(created by ATVs or 4-wheelers) and the
planned construction impacts to these areas
will be superficial. The designs for the
proposed trails emphasize their natural
integration into the preserve. Consequently,
trail construction will consist of limited
leveling and filling, and no hard walking
surfaces (e.g., asphalt or cinders) will be
applied.

For survey purposes, the trail system
was divided into three sections: western,
central, and eastern. The initial nine shovel
tests (STs 1-9) were conducted on the
western third of the proposed trail (Figure
6). After cultural materials were recovered
from ST 9, seven additional tests (STs 1016) were excavated in an attempt to
delineate the new site, which was later
designated 41MQ211 (see below).
STs 17 and 18 were placed in the
area planned to be the parking lot/pavilion
area (Figures 2, 7). This area borders the
old Fuzzel Road location of the proposed
pavilion and like that area, is partially
covered by road construction fills. Other
disturbances in this area include its apparent
use as an equipment staging area for an
adjacent sand quarrying pit, and then later,
its use as a trailer home residence. The two
shovel tests recovered large amounts of
modern debris, including glass shards,
concrete and asphalt chunks, road gravels,
wire nails, and crushed shell.

The majority of the project property
consisted of naturally wooded areas, with
heavy undergrowth that provided less than
10 percent ground surface visibility (Figure
4). However, significant portions of the
planned Greenbelt routes will follow heavily
worn and incised ATV/4-wheeler trails. The

8

An additional 10 shovel tests (STs
19-28) were located along the planned trail
route in the easternmost trail section. A
single flake was recovered from ST 22. An
additional six tests (STs 29-34) were then
excavated in an attempt to located additional
cultural materials in this area. No additional
materials were recovered, and the flake was
designated as an “isolated find” (see below).

Site 41MQ211
This newly recorded site was
initially identified by two chert flakes
recovered from ST 9 (Figures 3, 6; Table 2).
Eventually, a total of eight shovel tests (STs
9-16) were excavated in the area in an
attempt to delineate the site. Of these, three
tests produced a total of six prehistoric
artifacts (Table 2). These included one
secondary chert flake, two tertiary chert
flakes, and three chert flake fragments. The
positive shovel tests were concentrated in a
small (< 10 m) area along the south side of
the trail, and appears to be centered on a
narrow, low north-south ridge.
These
factors suggest the site extends beyond the
current project’s APE to the south and
possibly to the north as well. In terms of
their vertical distribution, the artifacts were
recovered from 10-70 cm below ground
surface.

Isolated Find
A single chert flaked fragment was
recovered from ST 22. An additional six
shovel tests (STs 29-34) were then placed
around the initial test, but all were negative
for cultural materials. The artifact was
recovered in the uppermost 10 cm of the
shovel test, and due to the degree of
previous disturbance along this portion of
the trail, is most likely not in primary
context. This portion of the trail is located
approximately 30 m east of a small hill.
This low rise has a large flat area that
overlooks the creek and would appear to be
a high probability area for containing a
prehistoric site, and if so, may be the
original source of the flake. If future
impacts are planned for this upland area, it is
recommended that the hill be inspected for
cultural materials. Due to the lack of
additional materials along the trail, the flake
was designated as an isolated find and was
replaced near its point of recovery after
shovel testing had been completed.

In summary, 41MQ211 represents a
small prehistoric site located along the
upland edge of Spring Creek. The site’s
east-west dimensions appear to be less than
10 m in width. The north and south end of
the site could not be identified because it
extended outside the narrow APE of the
proposed trail. Based on the shovel testing,
artifacts are distributed from 10-70 cmbs.
Recovered cultural materials suggest the
small site contains an extremely light
density of artifacts, and a limited range of
artifact diversity.

findings determined that the project could
proceed as planned, and noted that the “site
is buried between levels two and seven (2070 cm bs) and should be preserved and
protected until it can be fully assessed for
significance” (THC letter, dated February
20, 2007). The review also stipulated that
the “county must periodically monitor this
site
location
for
erosion
and/or
disturbances,” and stated that “if artifacts are
exposed at any time, this short trail segment
should be closed to the public and additional
investigations will be warranted.”

The portion of the site included
within the current trail APE appears to
represent ephemeral, low-density cultural
deposits that would offer little potential for
yielding new information. Consequently, no
further work is recommended within the
current APE. However, should any impacts
be planned for outside the current APE,
additional archeological investigations will
be required to more accurately determine the
boundaries and nature of the prehistoric site.
Once the current report is finalized, the
recovered artifacts will be curated at TARL.

Shovel tests along the proposed trail
route recovered an isolated find and
identified and delineated a new site,
41MQ211. The single flake fragment
identified as the isolated find was reburied
near its point of recovery after shovel testing
was completed.
The cultural materials
recovered from site 41MQ211 were
restricted to a small area, and consisted of
chert flakes and flake fragments. The
artifacts’ wide vertical distribution (10-70
cmbs) suggests they are not associated with
an intact or stable remnant living surface.
The limited number and types of recovered
artifacts suggest the encountered deposits
represent either a small and ephemeral,
short-term occupation site, or the tests were

In the event that archeological
deposits or features should be encountered
in other areas during construction, work
should cease in the immediate vicinity and
the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.
