ABSTRACT
MarkWest Energy West Texas Gas Company, L.L.C. (MarkWest) is proposing to construct the WXP
Interconnect Pipeline Project (Project), an approximate 7.63-mile- (mi-) (12.23- kilometer- [km-]),
intrastate natural gas pipeline, in Reeves County, Texas (Project). Ground disturbing activities associated
with Project include clearing of existing vegetation, grading, and excavation within a defined construction
right-of-way (ROW).
The majority of the Project will traverse private property and is not subject to state or federal regulatory
triggers. However, two discontinuous segments totaling 2.52 mi (4.07 km) cross property owned by the
Texas General Land Office (GLO), a political subdivision of the State of Texas. As such, the portion of
the Project that traverses the GLO property falls under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas
(Code). Cultural resources investigations across this portion of the Project, designated herein as the Permit
Area, were conducted in order to satisfy the requirements of the Code. The purpose of the survey was to
identify any prehistoric and historic-age archeological sites located within the Area of Potential Effect
(APE) specific to the Permit Area, and evaluate their significance and eligibility for designation as a State
Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 8794. The remaining portions of this pipeline traverse private property. As such,
only the portions of pipeline corridor that crosses state lands will be discussed herein.
To provide flexibility to MarkWest during workspace design, Perennial Environmental Services, LLC
(Perennial) conducted survey efforts within a broader environmental survey area (ESA) that totaled
approximately 61.68 acres. Actual Project impacts will be restricted to a smaller workspace, the limits of
which will be determined following engineering analysis. Depths of impact associated with the actual APE
are anticipated to range from 3.0 to 6.0 feet (ft) (0.9 to 1.8 meters [m]). Subsequent to the submittal of the
Project scope of work and permit application but prior to survey efforts, MarkWest revised the pipeline
route significantly reducing the overall length of the proposed Project. As such, the APE across public
lands was reduced and recalculated from the originally provided scope of work. A Phase I survey was
conducted across the portions of public lands only within the revised footprint. All of the original Project
records associated with the Permit Area (Permit #8794) as well as a copy of this Phase I report will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). Jennifer Cochran served as the Principal
Investigator (PI) for the Project and Sarah Boudreaux and Clay Taylor assisted with the field efforts on
February 25 to 27, 2019.
The survey investigations included the excavation of a total of 70 shovel tests, and resulted in the
documentation of two archaeological sites (41RV170 and 41RV171) and one isolated find (IF-1). Based
upon the solitary nature of IF-1, this artifact was not formally recorded as an archeological site and does
not require further assessment. Sites 41RV170 and 41RV171 consist of prehistoric lithic scatters entirely
confined to the modern ground surface. Artifacts were observed in low quantities across the surface of each
site. No temporally diagnostic stone tools, cultural features, or intact cultural deposits were observed on
either site. Based on the lack of significant, intact cultural deposits, it is Perennialâs opinion that sites
41RV170 and 41RV171 be considered as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as a SAL.
No further work is being recommended for sites 41RV107 and 41RV171, or the remainder of the Permit
Area in conjunction the Project

Artifacts observed the two newly discovered sites and one isolated find were not collected. Instead, they
were photographed and documented in situ. Following the guidelines set forth by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), outlined in the Texas Administrative Code Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26, Subchapter C,
Rule Â§26.16, and in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA), all documentation
pertaining to the Project and newly recorded sites will be submitted and housed at Texas Archaeological
Research Laboratory, an accredited archaeological repository.
Based on the results of the survey effort, no intact, significant cultural resources will be affected by any
construction activities within the Permit Area. In accordance with the Code, Perennial recommends no
further cultural resources investigations within the 61.68-acre Permit Area.
Should historic properties and/or human remains be encountered during construction, work in the
immediate area will cease and a qualified archaeologist will be called to evaluate the finding(s) and provide
recommendations for how to manage the resource under the State Historic Preservation Plan. All findings
will be reported to, and activities coordinated with the appropriate interested parties. In the event that
human remains are encountered, all activity that might disturb the remains shall cease, and may not resume
until authorized by appropriate law enforcement, and/or the Texas Historical Commission (THC).

INTRODUCTION
MarkWest Energy West Texas Gas Company, L.L.C. (MarkWest) is proposing to construct the
WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project (Project), an approximate 7.63-mile- (mi-) (12.23- kilometer[km-]), intrastate natural gas pipeline, in Reeves County, Texas (Project) (Figure 1). Ground
disturbing activities associated with Project include clearing of existing vegetation, grading, and
excavation within a defined construction right-of-way (ROW).
The majority of the Project will traverse private property and is not subject any state or federal
regulatory triggers. However, two discontinuous segments totaling 2.52 mi (4.07 km) will cross
property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO), a political subdivision of the State of
Texas. As such, the portion of the Project that traverses the GLO property falls under the
jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Code). Cultural resources investigations across this
portion of the Project, designated herein as the Permit Area, were conducted in order to satisfy the
requirements of the Code. The purpose of the survey was to identify any prehistoric and historicage archeological sites located within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) specific to the Permit
Area, and evaluate their significance and eligibility for designation as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL). The cultural resources investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 8794. The remaining portions of this pipeline traverse private property. As such, only
the portions of pipeline corridor that crosses state lands will be discussed herein.
To provide flexibility to MarkWest during workspace design, Perennial Environmental Services,
LLC (Perennial) conducted survey efforts within a broader environmental survey area (ESA) that
totaled approximately 61.68 acres. Actual Project impacts will be restricted to a smaller
workspace, the limits of which will be determined following engineering analysis. Depths of
impact associated with the actual APE are anticipated to range from 3.0 to 6.0 feet (ft) (0.9 to 1.8
meters [m]). Jennifer Cochran served as the Principal Investigator (PI) for the Project and Sarah
Boudreaux and Clay Taylor assisted with the field efforts on February 25 to 27, 2019. Subsequent
to the submittal of the Project scope of work and permit application but prior to survey efforts,
MarkWest revised the pipeline route significantly reducing the overall length of the proposed
Project from 15.5 mi (24.9 km) to 7.63 mi (12.23 km). The over length of the proposed Project
across land managed by the GLO was also reduced from 5.6 mi (9.0 km) to 2.52 mi (4.07 km). As
such, the APE across public lands was reduced and recalculated from the originally provided scope
of work. A Phase I survey was conducted across the portions of public lands only within the
revised footprint. All of the original Project records associated with the Permit (Permit #8794) as
well as a copy of this Phase I report will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL).
The survey investigations included the excavation of a total of 70 shovel tests, and resulted in the
documentation of two archaeological sites (41RV170 and 41RV171) and one isolated find (IF-1).
Based upon the solitary nature of IF-1, this artifact was not formally recorded as an archeological
site and does not require further assessment.

PERMIT AREA DESCRIPTION
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The Permit Area is located approximately 16.6 mi (26.7 km) northwest of Pecos, Texas.
According to aerial imagery and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps, the state lands
are situated within an erosional setting with disturbances present along the Permit Area from a past
oil and gas activities. Topography across the Permit Area consists of rolling uplands with
vegetation typical of the Trans-Pecos ecoregion (TPWD 2019; Griffith 2004). Much of the
landscape is dominated by desert grassland, but many of the native grasses have been replaced by
scrub vegetation as a result of overgrazing. Based upon recent aerial imagery, surface ground
visibility appears good to excellent. Landscape alterations caused by prolific oil and gas
development are prevalent across much of this region.
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
Geologically, the Permit Area is underlain by Older Alluvial Deposits (Qao) (USGS 2019). Older
Alluvial Deposits consist of alluvium, colluvium, and caliche with pebbles, cobbles, large
boulders, and sand present within these deposits. Typically, these deposits date to the Pleistocene
age.
Three soil types are mapped within the Permit Area, including Delnorte-Chilicotol association,
rolling (12), Hoban-Reeves-Holloman association, nearly level (17), and Reakor association,
nearly level (32). The Delnorte series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to petrocalcic.
These soils are formed in calcareous loamy materials containing igneous gravel on nearly level
hilly uplands, fan piedmonts, and fan remnants on slopes ranging from 0 to 30 percent. The
Chilicotal series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in
loamy gravelly piedmont sediments from igneous mountains. These soils are on gently undulating
to strongly rolling fan remnants and alluvial fans on slopes ranging from 1 to 50 percent. The
Reakor series are very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium derived from mixed
sources. Reakor soils are on broad plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent. The
Hoban series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous
loamy or clayey alluvium. These soils are on broad, nearly level to very gently sloping valleys,
alluvial outwash plains or broad basins on slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent. The Reeves series
consists of very deep soils that are moderately deep to gypsum material. These soils are well
drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous and gypsiferous fine textured
alluvium derived from gypsum beds on hillslopes, plateaus, and basin floors on slopes ranging
from 0 to 9 percent. The Holloman series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained,
moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous, and gypsiferous sediments.
Holloman soils are located on basins, valley floors or adjacent terraces and have slopes that range
from 0 to 50 percent (NRCS 2019).

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
Prior to initiating fieldwork, Perennial conducted a records and literature review of the Texas
Historical Commission (THC)âs Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database and the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) database to identify previously recorded cultural
resource sites, historic structures, properties listed on the NRHP, designated historic districts, or
designation as SALs which could potentially be affected by the proposed Project. Any previously
recorded cultural resource site forms, reports of archaeological investigations, general historical
documents, and secondary sources concerning the background of the area were reviewed. The
records search included a review of all previously recorded site forms and surveys on file within a
1.6-km (1.0-mi) review radius of the ESA.
In addition to a records and literature search, archeologists gathered information from secondary
sources concerning the prehistoric and historic background of the area. Documents associated
with the history of the area were used to model prehistoric and historic settlement patterns in
relation to the landscape and terrain characteristics as well as cultural patterns and regional trends.
NRCS soil data, the USGS Pecos, Texas 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle, aerial photographs,
and contemporary geologic and physiographic features were also examined.
FIELD METHODS
The cultural resources survey was performed by a team of two archaeologists. The field crew
surveyed the entire 2.52-mi (4.07-km) segment within the Permit Area. In areas with ground
surface visibility less than 30 percent, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards
(TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.0 mi (1.6 km) for linear survey corridors
measuring up to 100.0 ft. (30.5 m) in width. However, the ground surface visibility across all
surveyed portions of the ESA was excellent ranging from 65 to 100 percent visibility. As such, no
minimum shovel tests were required across the ESA. In accordance with the approved scope of
work (Appendix A), Perennial implemented a pedestrian survey and intermittent shovel testing
program. Specifically, two transects of shovel tests spaced approximately 328.0 to 492.0 ft (100.0
to 150.0 m) apart in length were excavated within the ESA in order to assess the area for buried
cultural deposits. Each shovel test transect was spaced approximately 98.4 ft (30.0 m) apart along
the width of the ESA.
Per the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)/THC survey standards, shovel tests were excavated
to a depth consistent with the Project impacts or to the base of Holocene deposits likely to contain
cultural resources unless dense clays or impenetrable soils prevent the continuation of excavations.
Shovel tests measured approximately 11.8 inches (in) (30 centimeters [cm]) in diameter and were
excavated to a depth of 3.3 ft (1.0 m). In many cases, shovel tests were terminated at shallower
depths due to the presence of compact sand with high concentrations of caliche or leached soils.

All soil matrices were screened through 6.3-millimeter (Â¼-inch) mesh hardware cloth unless
dominated by clay. Clayey matrix was trowel-sorted and visually inspected. The matrix from
each shovel test was screened through 0.25-in (6.0-millimeter [mm]) mesh. For each shovel test,
Perennial recorded the following information on standardized shovel test forms: location,
maximum depth, and the number of soil strata. For each soil stratum, thickness, texture, color,
and the presence or absence and nature of cultural materials were recorded. During field survey,
the archaeologist was equipped with a handheld sub-meter GeoXT Trimble GPS device,
topographic maps and aerial photographs of the ESA, a digital camera, as well as shovel test and
photographic logs, and daily journal forms.
When an archaeological site was identified, the appropriate delineation techniques were
systematically applied to identify the horizontal and vertical limits of each siteâs boundary. Site
boundaries were determined based on both surface artifact density and the presence or lack of
subsurface components. For subsurface sites, a series of shovel tests would have been excavated
radiating in the four cardinal directions or, if more appropriate, along perceived major and minor
topographic and site axes. In practice, shovel tests within potential sites were placed along
transects at 33.0-foot (10.0-meter) intervals to determine the depth and potential integrity of
cultural deposits, and to carefully examine for the presence of intact archaeological features and/or
discrete episodes of occupation. However, no subsurface sites were encountered. In the absence
of subsurface deposits, controlled pedestrian surface inspections were conducted and site
boundaries defined based on a marked reduction in surface artifact density. For all sites, a
minimum of six shovel tests were excavated across each site (more for larger sites) regardless of
surface visibility unless bedrock is clearly present across the entirely of the site. Shovel testing or
pedestrian surveys were not conducted beyond the Project ESA to ensure no trespassing onto
private property occurs.
In addition to shovel testing, additional work in the form of backhoe trenching would have been
utilized to adequately areas with the potential to contain alluvial/colluvial deposits. However,
based upon a review of the geology, topography, soils, and extended distances from any major
waterways, the potential for any portion of the Permit Area to contain deeply buried cultural
deposits remains low. As such, additional investigation in the form of mechanical trenching is not
recommended for any portion of the Permit Area.
Perennial maintained a non-collection policy whereby all diagnostic artifacts were photodocumented, and representative samples of non-diagnostic materials were photographed by artifact
class for each site. Field data was collected on the spatial distribution of artifacts, artifact
concentrations, and densities of surface assemblages across all of the sites. Diagnostic artifacts
such as projectile points would have been typed in the field to the best extent possible based on
defining characteristics, design, and a comparative analysis of comparable assemblages in the
region.

CULTURAL SETTING
The cultural history of West Texas spans more than 12,000 years, from the earliest documented
human occupation in North America through the present. An examination of the material culture
and human experience over this time reveals patterns of cultural development, specialization, and
exchange with neighboring regions and communities. The following overview of western Texas
cultural history draws heavily from Miller and Kenmotsu (2004), Turpin (2004), and chronologies
that have largely been presented elsewhere. Both the prehistoric and historic cultural history of
western Texas is discussed here in order to fully contextualize the setting and findings of the Phase
I cultural resources survey of the Project.
The area of Texas focused upon in the following overview includes the Trans-Pecos region located
north of the Rio Grande River from El Paso to the confluence of the Pecos River (Pertulla 2004;
Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). This region includes El Paso, Hudspeth, Culberson, Brewster,
Presidio, Jeff Davis, Terrell, Pecos, and Reeves counties, and is an important geographic and
cultural transition point between northern Chihuahua, the American Southwest, and Central Texas
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). In addition, the following discussion will include the Lower Pecos
region located in Val Verde County at the confluence of the Pecos River and the Rio Grande. This
region represents a narrow elliptical shaped area which extends for roughly 95.0 mi (150.0 km) on
either side of the Rio Grande River (Turpin 2004). As needed, the discussion will reference the
greater Texas area as well as outside regions including the complex societies of the American
Southwest, northern Chihuahua, and the Southern High Plains region, which extends from
northwestern Texas through Oklahoma and the Central Plains (Drass 1998).
PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8,000 B.P.)
The Paleoindian period represents the first documented human occupation in North America.
Chronologically, this period extends from the Late Pleistocene into the Early Holocene (Bousman
et al. 2004). The paleoenvironment of this time corresponds to the Late Wisconsin interglacial
period of the last Ice Age, during which time glacial retreat resulted in a mild climate in western
Texas that was cooler and wetter than today (Kay 1998). Large savannas and densely forested
areas supported large herds of now-extinct Late Pleistocene megafauna such as mammoths
(Mammuthus sp.), bison (Bison antiquus), horses (Equus sp.), and camels (Camelops sp.)
(Bousman et al. 2004). Paleoindian peoples were generally organized into highly mobile bands of
hunter-gatherers with subsistence economies dependent upon the exploitation of large game
animals (Bousman et al 2004; Hofman and Graham 1998). Population density during the Late
Pleistocene was low with notable archaeological sites such as Blackwater Locality No. 1, Folsom
in eastern New Mexico, and the Wilson-Leonard (41WM235) site in Central Texas indicating
general trends in subsistence and material specialization over a large geographic area (Bousman
et al 2004; Hofman and Graham 1998).
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 6

Paleoindian chronology is highly dependent upon the classification of expertly crafted lanceolate
projectile points. Based upon changes in projectile point morphology and increased specialization
over time, the Paleoindian period is generally divided into three traditions: the Clovis complex and
Folsom complex in the early Paleoindian period, and the Plano/Cody complex in the Late
Paleoindian period (Pertulla 2004; Bousman et al. 2004).
In addition to the Paleoindian chronology outlined in the following overview, there is an emerging
consensus that humans were likely present in North and South America prior to the documented
appearance of Paleoindian peoples. Evidence for this older-than-Clovis or pre-Clovis horizon (ca
35,000-12,000 B.P.) comes largely from scarce lithic assemblages separated by a wide geographic
area (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:211; Waters et al. 2011). In southern Chile, the site of Monte
Verde has a pre-Clovis horizon dating to at least 14,600 B.P. (Dillehey 1997). In North America,
the site of Cactus Hill in Virginia may date as early as 20,000 to 18,000 B.P. (McAvoy and
McAvoy 1997). In central Texas, pre-Clovis horizons have been proposed in Area 12 and 15 of
the prominent Clovis period Gault Site (41BL323) and nearby at the Friedkin site (41BL1239) in
the Buttermilk Creek (Gandy 2013; Waters et al. 2011). The extensive assemblage from the
Friedkin site consists of over 15,500 lithic artifacts comprising a varied toolkit with some overlap
at the site in the activities and tool forms between the pre-Clovis and Clovis complex (Waters et
al. 2011). In the Trans-Pecos region, the proposed pre-Clovis horizon at the site of Pendejo Cave
remains largely contested prior to the death of prominent American archaeologist Scotty
MacNeish. From research at Pendejo Cave located on Fort Bliss, MacNeish and Libby (2003)
propose an older-than-Clovis occupation between ca. 55,000 and 12,000 B.P. which includes
imported stone, skin impressions, and a varied lithic assemblage with affiliated hearth features.
MacNeish documented a significant Paleoindian and Archaic component at the site as well,
compiling 75 radiometric dates that range between ca. 55,000 and 350 B.P. (MacNeish and Libby
2003). Although some portions of the pre-Clovis component at Pendejo Cave are more credible
than others, the site remains largely disputed. The nature of life during the pre-Clovis horizon is
subject to significant ongoing discussion. Generally, the rare occurrences of pre-Clovis material
are thought to represent human activities in North and South America prior to the appearance of
peoples that were already familiar with the landscape during the Paleoindian period (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004). The artifact assemblages from this period that have been recorded vary greatly
by site and do not provide generalized insights into subsistence or settlement patterns. As a result,
the classification of pre-Clovis chronology and implications for human migration remain highly
contested, and the relationship between pre-Clovis and Paleoindian period peoples is poorly
understood.
CLOVIS COMPLEX (CA. 12,000 TO 11,000 B.P.)
The most recognizable innovation of the Clovis complex consists of the deeply fluted lanceolate
projectile points that were first produced in the region during this time. This lithic technology was
initially recognized within the Clovis site at Blackwater Draw in eastern New Mexico, after which
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 7

a chronological sequence was established for the rest of North America (Bousman et al 2004;
Hofman and Graham 1998). In western Texas, there are few if any highly stratified Clovis sites,
and the majority of recovered materials consist of rare and isolated surficial occurrences of the
distinctive fluted projectile points that have been cross-referenced with other more well-defined
localities outside the region (Bousman et al. 2004; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). In the Trans-Pecos
region, few notable exceptions to this pattern include the Mockingbird Gap site and the Rhodes
Canyon site, both located in the Tularosa Basin of southeastern New Mexico (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004). Both sites contain stratified archaeological deposits that sequence Clovis tools with later
Paleoindian materials. In the Lower Pecos region, butchered faunal remains at the site of Cueve
Quebrada (41VV162A) likely overlap with the earliest boundary of this period but lack any
diagnostic lithic materials which may be affiliated with the Clovis complex (Bousman et al. 2004;
Turpin 2004). As a result of this narrow view an understanding of Paleoindian life in this period
is limited in western Texas and is highly dependent upon chronologies established outside the
region.
FOLSOM COMPLEX (CA. 11,000 TO 10,500 B.P.)
Following the Clovis complex, lithic materials in western Texas became increasingly specialized
over time. The Folsom complex, first identified in eastern New Mexico, was the next prominent
innovation in lithic technologies during the Paleoindian period. Like the Clovis complex, the
Folsom complex is distinguished by its lanceolate projectile points, which possess longer flutes,
finer flaking, and thinner cross sections than their Clovis complex predecessors (Bousman et al.
2004). In western Texas, the Folsom complex is more prominent than the preceding Clovis
material, with sites such as Bonfire Shelter (41VV218) and Midland (41MD1) contributing to
Folsom chronologies for the greater region (Hofman and Graham 1998). At the Midland site,
located on the margins of western Texas in the Southern Plains region, the classification of thinly
flaked unfluted lanceolate projectile points has led to the identification of a distinct Midland
complex or subgroup within the Folsom complex (Bousman et al. 2004; Hofman and Graham
1998).
In the Trans-Pecos region, Folsom material has been identified in both isolated surficial contexts
and more stratified archaeological deposits such as the Fillmore Pass site (FB1613) located on Fort
Bliss, the Boles Well site located in the Tularosa Basin, and Padre Canyon sites 41HZ504 and
41HZ505 located in the Hueco Bolson south of El Paso (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The most
extensive Folsom occupation in the Trans-Pecos may be seen at the Chispa Creek site, located
south of Van Horn, Texas in Culbertson County. The Chispa Creek site represents an intensive
long-term Folsom occupation with intact archaeological deposits containing nearly 100 Folsom
points, 500 lithic scrapers, and large quantities of lithic manufacturing debris and other stone tools
(Riddell 1969).

The Folsom complex in the Lower Pecos region is most prominent at the site of Bonfire Shelter
located on a tributary of the Rio Grande River approximately 15.0 mi (25.0 km) upstream from its
confluence with the Pecos River (Hofman and Graham 1998; Turpin 2004). The large rock shelter
was the scene of the earliest recorded bison jump in North America (ca. 10,000 B.P.), in which
herds of Late Pleistocene megafauna were driven off the cliff above and were butchered and
processed by Paleoindian peoples below (Bousman et al 2004; Turpin 2004). At the locality, a
Folsom point was recovered from over a living surface with other unfluted lanceolate projectile
points in one of the three bone bed deposits (Turpin 2004:269). As the Late Wisconsin interglacial
period came to an end in the Late Pleistocene, a period of gradual warming took place that
continued through the Early Holocene (Kay 1998). Many of the distinctive Late Pleistocene
megafaunal mammals became extinct and it is thought that Folsom peoples began subsisting upon
now-extinct bison (Bison antiquus or Bison occidentalis) (Bousman et al. 2004:81). This transition
in Paleoindian subsistence from the soon-to-be extinct megafauna to Early Holocene bison is
poorly understood and uniquely represented in the Lower Pecos region. The Bonfire Shelter
subperiod (ca. 10,700-9,800 B.P.) incorporates the Lower Pecos region with the greater Folsom
complex chronology, providing insight into Paleoindian life during a period of climatic and
environmental change (Bousman et al. 2004; Turpin 2004).
PLANO/CODY COMPLEX (CA. 10,500 TO 8,000 B.P.)
In the late Paleoindian period, numerous lithic technology adaptations were adopted, and projectile
point morphologies became increasingly complex. The variety of tool traditions present during
this period are collectively referred to as the Plano/Cody complexes (Hofman and Graham 1998;
Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Projectile points present during the Late Paleoindian period reflect
trends that continued into the Archaic period, including the lateral thinning of points, increasing
basal indention and constriction, and the first appearance of basal stems (Bousman et al. 2004;
Hofman and Graham 1998). These adaptations generally reflect a reduction in projectile point size
and the initial transition from lanceolate to stemmed forms. The paleoenvironment of this time
marks the Early Holocene period and the end of an era of Late Pleistocene megafauna (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:218). The Early Holocene follows the Late Wisconsin interglacial period and is
characterized by climatic diversity and abrupt temperature fluctuations (Kay 1998). Gradually
over this time western Texas experienced warmer and more arid conditions as the environment
transitioned to one closer to that of the present.
Plano/Cody complex materials recovered from western Texas reveal patterns of Late Paleoindian
adaptation with sites increasingly constricted to perennial water sources and evidence of diverse
subsistence strategies including the increased exploitation of plant life in those settings (Bousman
et al. 2004:75; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:218). In the Trans-Pecos region, prominent Plano/Cody
occupations have been observed at sites 41HZ347 and LA63880. Site 41HZ347, located east of
the Hueco Mountains in Hudspeth County may indicate increased settlement along drainages and
intermittent streams of the Diablo Plateau (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). As one of the largest
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 9

Paleoindian sites in the Trans-Pecos region, site LA63880 contributes to the understanding of
settlement patterns and mobility during the late Paleoindian period. The site, which covers an area
of approximately 19.2 ac (7.7 ha), is situated 1.25 mi (2.0 km) from a major playa and indicates
bison processing and extraction activities at multiple locales (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
The Plano/Cody complex materials recovered from the Lower Pecos region contribute to a pattern
of adaptation by late Paleoindian peoples including the broad exploitation of flora and fauna at the
Baker Cave (41VV213) site and the increased specialization of lithic technologies at the site of
Devilâs Mouth (41VV188) (Bousman et al. 2004; Hofman and Graham 1998; Turpin 2004). The
Baker Cave site in northern Val Verde County, Texas indicates the continued settlement within
rock shelters of the Lower Pecos regions during this time (Turpin 2004). At the site, which
overhangs a tributary of the Devils River, evidence of a diverse late Paleoindian subsistence
strategy has been observed in the remains of 17 reptile species, 11 mammal species, six fish
species, eight species of wooded plants, and 16 species of seeds and fruit, all recovered from a
repeatedly used hearth feature with late Paleoindian lithic materials (Bousman et al. 2004:83). The
assemblage, which dates to approximately 9,000 B.P., provides unique insight into late Paleoindian
subsistence strategies and dispels the persistent narrative of Paleoindian peoples as communal big
game hunters (Bousman et al. 2004:60). At Devilâs Mouth, located west of Del Rio at the
confluence of the Devils River and the Rio Grande, deeply stratified alluvial deposits preserve the
earliest appearance of the stemmed projectile point form in western Texas during the late
Paleoindian period (Bousman et al. 2004, Turpin 2004). Late Paleoindian technologies, including
perishables (basketry, cordage, and knotted rope), became increasingly specialized over time and
contributed to the formation of more complex economies in the Archaic period (Andrews and
Adovasio 1980, Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8,000 TO 1,750 B.P.)
The Archaic period represents the longest period of human occupation in western Texas, spanning
over 6,000 years from the Middle Holocene into the second half of the Late Holocene (Pertulla
2004). Prominent adaptations during this period include the first appearance of cultigens (e.g.,
corn and beans), the appearance of structural habitations, and the use of rock or caliche in thermal
features (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Many late Paleoindian period trends continued into the
Archaic period including an overall decrease in mobility and the continued diversification of
subsistence strategies. Life during this period is generally characterized by semi-sedentary bands
of hunter-gatherers exploiting seasonal vegetation in addition to large and small game. The
paleoenvironment of this period reflects continued warming trends and increasing aridity
throughout the region (Kay 1998b). The smaller morphologically distinct American Bison (Bison
bison) evolved during this time, replacing the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene species (Bison
antiquus, Bison occidentalis) (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:208). By the end of the Middle
Holocene, it is expected that the present climate had been established throughout western Texas
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:208). The Archaic period population was higher in western Texas
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 10

than during the preceding Paleoindian period (Kay 1998b; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:210).
Prominent sites in the region include the Fresnal Shelter, located 100 mi (160 km) north of El Paso
in the Sacremento Mountains, with its extensive occupational period of over 4,500 years, and the
Pecos River sites with their diagnostic rock art, mortuary customs, and settlement patterns (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004).
Conventionally, the Archaic period in western Texas is divided into the Early, Middle, and Late
subperiods based upon broad technological innovations (Pertulla 2004). Local chronologies have
also been established for the Trans-Pecos and Lower Pecos regions based upon trends in
subsistence and settlement patterns as well as resource specialization. For this reason, the
following discussion will outline separate chronologies when relevant that are based upon regional
adaptations and trends that may not conform completely to the broader Archaic period timeline.
In the Trans-Pecos region, MacNeish and Beckett classified the Archaic period into the Gardner
Phase and Keystone Phase in the Early and Middle Archaic period, and the Fresnal Phase and
Hueco Phase of the Late Archaic period (cited in Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). In the Lower Pecos
region, the Archaic period is generally divided among the Viejo subperiod in the Early Archaic;
the Eagle Nest and San Felipe subperiods in the Middle Archaic; and the Cibola, Flanders, and
Blue Hills subperiods in the Late Archaic (Turpin 2004). Although regional outlines established
in the Trans-Pecos and Lower Pecos represent important adaptations unique to their areas,
chronologies are largely consistent with the Archaic period timeline.
EARLY ARCHAIC (CA. 8,000 TO 6,000/5,000 B.P.)
The most prominent innovation of this period consists of the characteristic stemmed projectile
point forms, including the Jay, Bajada, and Uvalde types (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:220; Turpin
2004:270). By the Early Archaic, projectile points transitioned from the gradual constriction of
lanceolate point bases which was first observed in the late Paleoindian period to the production of
strong stemmed and split stemmed types (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:232). In addition, a shift
from fine grained lithic materials to lower-quality coarser materials has been observed during this
period from the fine-grained chert, chalcedony, and obsidian in the Paleoindian period to coarser
materials such as limestone, basalt, and other igneous and metamorphic rocks in the Early Archaic
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:221-223). This resource shift is consistent with a decreased mobility
pattern as Early Archaic peoples exploited smaller territories more intensively, providing less
opportunities to access remote high-quality lithic sources. The appearance of thermally treated
rock features is also an important innovation during this period (Kay 1998b; Miller and Kenmotsu
2004). Thermal features, such as hearths containing fire-cracked-rock or burnt caliche, and
affiliated ground-stone artifacts all indicate greater plant-processing activities and the broadening
of Early Archaic subsistence strategies (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:221). Although the appearance
of thermally treated rock features is an important innovation during the Early Archaic, few intact
radiometric dates have been recovered and Early Archaic chronology is still highly dependent
upon projectile point classification.
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 11

In the Trans-Pecos region, intact Early Archaic occupations have been prominently observed
within the Gardner Spring Arroyo located in the Jornada del Muerto Basin of southeast New
Mexico, where Beckett (1973) recovered an intact metate from a hearth feature with a radiometric
date of 7,570 to 7,020 B.P (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:220). At the Phantom Spring site (41JD63)
north of Fort Davis, an Uvalde projectile point was recovered from an affiliated hearth feature
containing a radiometric date of 6,150 to 5,950 B.P, representing one of the few examples of
diagnostic lithic material recovered intact with an affiliated radiometric date (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:221). These represent rare examples of quantifiably dated material in the Trans-Pecos. Early
Archaic occupations in the region most frequently represent small hearth features with sparse
scatters and isolated occurrences of Early Archaic projectile points.
In contrast, the Lower Pecos region contains numerous stratified sites which more clearly
demonstrate Early Archaic adaptations to the increasingly arid environment. Rock shelters such
as Baker Cave (41VV213) and Hinds Cave (41VV456) demonstrate broad plant processing and
procurement including the increasing exploitation of succulents such as sotol (Dasylirion wheeleri)
and agave (Agave lechuguilla) in Early Archaic deposits (Turpin 2004:269-270). At this time
succulents are also procured for an established fiber industry which has been prominently observed
at Hinds Cave site (Andrews and Adovasio 1980). Although the production of perishable baskets,
netting, cordage, and knotted rope were first observed at Hinds Cave site in the Late Paleoindian
period, by the Early Archaic the fiber industry was fully established in the Lower Pecos region
with more durable items such as sandals potentially demonstrating affiliation with the
contemporary sites in Coahuila, Mexico (Andrews and Adovasio 1980; Turpin 2004:270). The
Early Archaic contains the earliest recorded appearance of an extensive mortuary site in Western
Texas, within the site of Seminole Sink (41VV620) where twenty-one individuals were recovered
from a vertical cave shaft (Turpin 2004:270). Earlier human remains from the Paleoindian period
represent isolated occurrences of a single individual, however individuals recovered from the
Seminole Sink site represent all ages of both sexes. Treatment of the remains is uniform at
Seminole Sink and does not suggest any social stratification in the population, indicating a largely
egalitarian society in the Early Archaic period.
MIDDLE ARCHAIC (CA. 6,000/5,000 TO 3,200 B.P.)
The Middle Archaic period saw changes in settlement patterns and group mobility throughout
western Texas. During this period perennial water sources were increasingly constricted as drying
trends continued throughout the Middle Holocene (Kay 1998a). Flooding events at Arenosa
Shelter (41VV99) in the Lower Pecos between 4,500 and 3,200 BP are consistent with increased
seasonality and climatic variability (Patton 1977; Kay 1998a:28). During this time seasonal landuse patterns developed in which Middle Archaic peoples exploited upland areas more intensively,
relying upon task-oriented collecting rather than yearlong foraging (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Generally, there is evidence of population growth during the Middle Archaic as artifact
assemblages become more substantial, and sites increasingly contain two or more hearths, in
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 12

addition to larger field-size burned rock middens (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:223). By the end of
the Middle Holocene (ca. 4,000 B.P.) it is expected that the present environmental conditions had
been established throughout the Chihuahua desert and Lower Pecos regions (Van Devender et al.
1987).
In the Trans-Pecos region, the Keystone Dam sites 41EP492 and 41EP493, and Vista del Sol
(41EP2970) reflect an increased settlement along the Rio Grande Valley, northwest of El Paso.
Within the exposed interior, sites are increasingly concentrated along drainages and perennial
water sources as Middle Archaic communities adapted to environmental niches of the arid
environment (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Some of the earliest structures in the greater region
have been prominently recorded by OâLaughlin (1980), at the Keystone Dam site 33, located along
the lowermost terrace of the Rio Grande Valley. As many as 23 pit-house structures have been
recorded dating between 4,500 and 3,800 B.P. (OâLaughlin 1980). These earliest structures
consisted of shallow depressions approximately 6.5 ft (2.0 m) in diameter with post-holes
indicative of a perishable fiber superstructures. The exteriors were likely plastered with mud daub
and the structures may have had minimal interior features such as a hearth. Similar contemporary
structures recorded at other sites along the Rio Grande Valley as well as within the Hueco Bolson
south of El Paso indicate a significant adaptation throughout the Trans-Pecos region during the
Middle Archaic (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:224).
During the Middle Archaic in the Lower Pecos, utilization of rock shelters increased, which has
been interpreted as the successful adaptation to an arid environment (Turpin 2004). By 5,000 B.P.
the exploitation of succulents by the Baker Cave community had become highly specialized with
a significant amount of energy invested in the labor-intensive procurement and processing of the
resource (Turpin 2004:270). In the Lower Pecos, the latter half of the Middle Archaic is locally
classified within the San Felipe subperiod (ca. 4,100 to 3,200 B.P.), and is characterized by the
earliest highly complex pictographic tradition within North America known as the Pecos River
style (Turpin 2004). These monumental rock art forms contain polychromatic illustrations of
animals and anthropomorphic figures in hunting and ceremonial settings. The size, complexity,
and accessibility of these monuments indicate that they were intended for communal consumption
(Turpin 2004:271). The content of the monuments and the repetition of stylized forms indicates
abstract symbolism and a socially complex belief system within the Middle Archaic communities
of the Lower Pecos. One prominent figure has widely been interpreted as portraying a shaman, a
ubiquitous religious figure present within many hunter-and-gathering traditions.
This
identification of a central figure is significant in reflecting early social stratification within a
potentially ranked society during the Middle Archaic (Turpin 2004).
LATE ARCHAIC (CA. 3,200 TO 1,750/1,550 B.P.)
The Late Archaic in western Texas represents a significant departure from previous Early and
Middle Archaic trends in settlement and subsistence. The paleoenvironment of this period
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 13

coincides with relatively arid conditions throughout the Late Holocene, containing a brief interval
of cooling which resulted in more temperate and wetter conditions approximately 2,500 B.P.
(Bryant and Holloway 1985, 63). This episode of cooling resulted in extensive grasslands
throughout the Trans-Pecos interior and Lower Pecos that would have allowed herds of migratory
grazing animals to enter the region. In the Trans Pecos region there is a significant resettling of the
interior basins, with unprecedented population growth observed throughout western Texas (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004). In the Lower-Pecos region, the Late Holocene cooling interval coincides
with the mass bison deposition at the site of Bonfire Shelter (41VV218) where approximately 800
individual bison remains are accompanied by characteristic Late Archaic dart points and
processing tools (ca. 2,600 B.P.) (Turpin 2004:274). An increased affiliation with the greater
region has also been observed during the Late Archaic including northern Mexico and the
American Southwest. In the Trans-Pecos region, obsidian sourced from the Rio Grande Valley has
been identified at several Late Archaic sites approximately 60.0 mi (100.0 km) south of the Hueco
and Mesilla Bolsons, in Chihuahua, Mexico (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). In the Lower Pecos, the
Shumla dart point, characteristic of the Flanders subperiod (ca. 2300 B.P.) has origins in Nuevo
LeÃ³n and Coahuila, Mexico as early as 3,100 B.P. (Turpin 2004).
Among the most significant adaptations during the Late Archaic includes the initial appearance of
cultigens and the introduction of horticulture as a subsistence strategy along the Rio Grande
Valley. Evidence for corn (Zea mays) and later beans (Phaseolus sp.) has been recovered from
several sites in the western Trans-Pecos including the Keystone Dam sites, Fresnal Shelter, and
Tornillo Shelter as early as 3,415 to 2,935 B.P. (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:226-278). The
introduction of horticulture in the Trans-Pecos coincides with an increased procurement of plants
overall, as well as the exploitation of large and small game within a broad subsistence base.
FORMATIVE PERIOD/LATE PREHISTORIC (CA. 1,750/1,550 TO 500 B.P.)
The Formative/Late Prehistoric period represents the apex of population growth and technological
innovation in western Texas. Significant changes in subsistence and settlement patterns are
encompassed by this period which parallel developments throughout the greater region including
the American Southwest and northern Mexico (Pertulla 2004; Kanter 2004; Drass 1998). In
western Texas, the Formative/Late Prehistoric period is characterized by the adoption of both
ceramics and the bow-and-arrow (Pertulla 2004:8). Complex rock art styles have been observed
in the Lower Pecos region and the Big Bend area of the Trans-Pecos region during this time (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004; Turpin 2004). The adaptations of this period culminated in western TransPecos region with the establishment of agriculturally dependent sedentary communities of the
Jornada Mogollon with their Pueblo architecture, polychrome ceramics, and extended trade
networks (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Kanter 1998).
Regional chronologies during the Formative/Late Prehistoric period are highly specialized
classifying the unique innovations and adaptations which occurred throughout western Texas. In
the Trans-Pecos region, the Formative/Late Prehistoric period began approximately 1,750 to 1,550
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 14

B.P. (Pertulla 2004). Following the Late Archaic, the chronologies of western Texas become
increasingly asymmetrical with the Late Prehistoric period not occurring in the Lower Pecos region
for another 400 years, circa 1,320 B.P. (Pertulla 2004). The Formative/Late Prehistoric period in
the Trans-Pecos region is usually divided between the Jornada Mogollon region of the western
Trans-Pecos and the La Junta region of the eastern Trans-Pecos. Conventionally, the Jornada
Mogollon region is classified between three phases of innovation and adaptation consisting of the
Mesilla phase, the Dona Ana phase, and the El Paso phase (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). In the La
Junta region the Formative/Late Prehistoric period began later than in the western Trans-Pecos (ca.
1,050/950 B.P.) and is classified within the poorly defined Chisos phase, the Livermore phase, and
the La Junta phase (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The chronology of the Lower Pecos region is
classified within the Late Prehistoric period consisting of the Flecha and Infierno phases (Turpin
2004).
In the Trans-Pecos region, adaptations that are characteristic of the Formative/Late Prehistoric
period first occurred in the western Trans-Pecos region and were later adopted in other areas of
western Texas (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Throughout the early Formative/Late Prehistoric
period, life outside of the western Trans-Pecos was largely continuous with the Late Archaic
consisting of seasonally mobile hunter-gathering groups with a broad subsistence base (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004). In the western Trans-Pecos, early El Paso brownware ceramics as well as nonlocal ceramics initially appeared prior to any significant changes in subsistence and settlement
patterns (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:242-243). Structural forms gradually evolved in complexity
during this period from the generic circular pithouses first used in the Archaic period to larger
orthogonal pithouses which contained increasingly formal features such as prepared ground
surfaces, hearths, altars, and storage or burial pits (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:239). Overtime
structures became increasingly robust utilizing caliche plaster or adobe. By the latter half of the
Formative/Late Prehistoric period (ca. 700 B.P.) individual surface structures had been combined
into elaborate contiguous room blocks or pueblos (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:238). At Hot Well
Pueblo (41EP15) located in the Hueco Bolson over 100 rooms have been identified in contiguous
room blocks containing as many as twelve rooms (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:242-243). By this
period, life in the western Trans-Pecos was largely characterized by agricultural communities
living in sedentary villages. Sites such as Hot Well Pueblo, Embree Pueblo and the Sabina
Mountain sites contain abundant evidence for cultigens such as corn (Zea mays), beans (Phaseolus
vulgaris, Phaseolus acutifolius, Phaseolus lunatus), and squash (Cucurbita sp.), that are common
throughout the greater region (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:248; Kanter 2004). Ceramic
technologies during this period became increasingly diversified with El Paso bichromatic and
polychromatic types (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:252). In the eastern Trans-Pecos this period
corresponds to the Late Prehistoric La Junta phase, which includes the adoption of many western
Formative adaptations including ceramics, the use of the bow-and-arrow and the construction of
individual circular pithouses (Pertulla 2004:8; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). There is additional
evidence for agricultural activity within the La Junta region however communities in the eastern
Trans-Pecos largely continued a broad subsistence base, employing agriculture less intensively
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 15

than in the Jornada Mogollon (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). During the Formative/Late Prehistoric
period there is evidence for increased cultural affiliation with the American Southwest and greater
region in the Trans-Pecos region. The pattern of population growth and decline during the
Formative/Late Prehistoric period largely conforms to regional centers such as Casas Grandes
(Paquime) located in northern Chihuahua, approximately 130.0 mi (210.0 km) southwest of El
Paso, with its multi-story apartments and ceremonial ball court (Kanter 2004:182-184). Intrusive
ceramic types such as the Chihuahua polychromes and Playas Red ceramics from the Casas
Grandes tradition, as well as Chupadero black-on-white ceramics from eastern New Mexico have
been recovered from sites such as the Wind Canyon (41HZ119) southwest of Van Horn, and at the
Polvo site (41PS21) in the eastern Trans-Pecos (Kanter 2004:194; Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:256).
In the Lower Pecos region, adaptations characteristic of the Formative/Late Prehistoric period in
the Trans-Pecos region were not fully adopted and technological innovations, such as ceramics
and the bow-and-arrow, serve to supplement a broad subsistence base (Pertulla 2004; Turpin
2004). Settlement patterns are largely continuous with the Late Archaic reflecting the importance
of natural rock shelters within the canyon landscape. The introduction of discrete rock art styles
and changes in mortuary customs at this time indicates the introduction of peoples from northern
Mexico to the Lower Pecos region (Turpin 2004:275). The Red Monochrome style characterized
by its frontal poses and static images has been frequently observed throughout the Lower Pecos at
sites such as Painted Shelter (41VV78), located near Cornstock, Texas in a small side canyon of
the Rio Grande (Turpin 2004:275). The Bold Line Geometric style, characterized by its crosshatching and geometric shapes, has been observed at sites such as 41VV138 and 41VV187 near
the mouth of the Pecos River and is clearly affiliated with Desert Abstract styles of northern
Mexico (Turpin 2004:276). Changes in mortuary customs characteristic of the Late Prehistoric
period include flexed textile wrapped bundle burials, common throughout the greater American
Southwest, and the use of cairn burials characterized by oblong rock covered interments (Turpin
2004:275). The end of the Late Prehistoric period in the Lower Pecos region corresponds to the
Infierno phase and is characterized by its diagnostic tool kit composed of triangular stemmed arrow
points, end-scrapers, beveled knives, and bone or caliche tempered plain ceramics (Turpin
2004:276-277). This period is also characterized by the appearance of stone circles in the Lower
Pecos upland interior which likely supported perishable covers or tipis. At the Infierno Camp
(41VV446), more than 100 stone rings have been identified likely representing the seasonal
exploitation of plants and game in the upland interior by Infierno peoples (Turpin 2004).
PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 500 TO 350 B.P.)
The Protohistoric period as discussed here follows the decline of the agricultural communities of
the Jornada Mogollon and encompasses the largely undefined period between initial European
contact in western Texas and the establishment of historic communities. Between A.D. 1450 and
1500 pueblo settlements across the Trans-Pecos were largely abandoned reflecting the
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 16

depopulation of major centers such as Casas Grandes in the greater American Southwest (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004; Kanter 2004). In the agriculturally dependent sedentary communities of the
Trans-Pecos region a shift in subsistence and settlement patterns likely occurred to the less
intensive hunter-and-gathering strategies recorded by early Spanish explorers (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004). In the Lower Pecos region the aforementioned Infierno phase overlaps with this
period, where Late Prehistoric peoples maintained relatively low density settlement patterns and a
broad subsistence base. Numerous pressures may have contributed to the rapid decrease in
population density observed during this period. An extended period of drought beginning in the
late fourteenth-century in New Mexico coupled with rapid population growth and agricultural
overconsumption may have resulted in subsistence failure for the agriculturally dependent
societies of the Trans-Pecos and greater American Southwest (Kanter 2004:201-202; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004). During this period there is evidence of significant conflict and warfare at Casas
Grandes through the construction of defensive structures as well as the remains of 127 individuals
who went unburied in excavated portions of the community (Kanter 2004:251-253). In the TransPecos region there is evidence of burning at Hot Well Pueblo and Escondida Pueblo, and potential
evidence of large-scale burning at Embree Pueblo (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:258). As declining
environmental conditions and decreasing settlement patterns occurred earlier in the northern
portion of the American Southwest there were additional pressures upon the Trans-Pecos and
Lower Pecos regions from migrant communities originating from outside the region. During this
period Athabaskan speaking groups such as the Apache and Navajo entered the American
Southwest from the north with the Apache principally settling throughout western Texas in large
numbers (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Turpin 2004).
Beginning in A.D. 1535 European contact with western Texas first occurred when Cabeza de Vaca
and survivors of the NarvÃ¡ez expedition crossed the Rio Grande at La Junta de las Rios in the
eastern Trans-Pecos (Thoms 2007; Whelan and Dial 2005). European influence in the region
undoubtedly predates this moment as populations to the south were displaced by the preceding
conquest of Mexico and the Spanish colonization of Central America. In the late sixteenth-century
numerous Spanish entradas passed through western Texas, including the Chamuscado and
Rodriguez Expedition in A.D. 1581 and the Antonio de Espejo expedition in 1583 (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:259; Whelan and Dial 2005). In A.D. 1590 Gaspar CastaÃ±o de Sosa, then
lieutenant governor of Nuevo Leon led 160 to 170 soldiers across the Rio Grande near Del Rio in
the Lower Pecos while en route to Pecos Pueblo in central New Mexico (Turpin 2004). Europeans
of this period documented descendants of the Jornada Mogollon such as the Manso and Suma
peoples near El Paso as well as latter migrants such as the Apache in the Lower Pecos region
(Kenmotsu 2005). Generally, late sixteenth-century incursions into the region focused upon the
remaining pueblo communities such as the Pecos and Acoma pueblos in central New Mexico
(Kanter 2004, Kenmotsu 2005). In A.D. 1598 Juan de OÃ±ate led an expeditionary force along the
Rio Grande passing through the El Paso Valley en route to New Mexico (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004, Whelan and Dial 2005). Before continuing into the Central Plains, OÃ±ate claimed all lands
drained by the Rio Grande founding the province of Santa Fe de Nuevo MÃ©xico (modern New
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Mexico) which largely encompassed the territory of western Texas (Whelan and Dial 2005;
Chipman 2005:56).
HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)
SPANISH COLONIAL PERIOD AND PUEBLO REVOLT
The Spanish presence in western Texas expanded during the seventeenth-century following the
founding of Nuevo Mexico. By A.D. 1610 the town of Santa Fe de San Francisco de AsÃ­s (modern
Santa Fe) was designated the provincial capital and Spanish settlers began entering the region
(Whelan and Dial 2005; Chipman 1992:57). Due to its location along the Rio Grande, caravans
regularly passed through the El Paso Valley encountering indigenous populations (Manso, Suma,
Apache) of western Texas (Whelan and Dial 2005; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:259). In A.D. 1659
the Spanish founded the first mission in western Texas, Nuestra SeÃ±orade Guadalupe de los
Mansos in the lower Rio Grande Valley of present downtown Ciudad JuÃ¡rez (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:261). As with other provinces, the establishment of missions, presidios, and pueblos
(settlements) was an effective strategy for the colonialization of western Texas and the assimilation
of indigenous peoples. However, it was not until the 1680s that western Texas would experience
a significant colonial occupation. By A.D. 1680 the spread of disease, the displacement of
indigenous communities, and the numerous examples of Spanish atrocities had culminated in the
widespread uprising of the Pueblo Revolt in which Puebloan communities throughout the region
succeeded in evicting approximately 2,000 Spanish settlers from New Mexico (Whelan and Dial
2005; Chipman 1992). The revolt was led by a Tewa leader named PopÃ© and was largely organized
at the present day Taos Pueblo (Chipman 1992:60). Following the uprising, the Spanish secured
their occupation of western Texas establishing settlements throughout the region. Spanish
colonists, as well as indigenous groups including the Tiwa (Tigua), Piro, and Tompiro that had
supported the Spanish or had not participated in the revolt, were resettled in the Rio Grande Valley
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The Spanish shifted their provincial capital from Santa Fe to El Paso
(modern Ciudad Juarez) and began constructing settlements throughout the area (Whelan and Dial
2005; Chipman 1992). The restored mission San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur in present El Paso
was founded at this time during the resettlement of the Tiwa (Whelan and Dial 2005). Rex Gerald
(1990) is believed to have located the Piro settlement of the Old Socorro Mission, south of El Paso
while investigating site 41EP1532 (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:261). In the eastern Trans-Pecos,
the mission of San Antonio de Los Puliques was established in A.D. 1683 at the Late Prehistoric
period Polvo site (41PS21) along with the settlement of Tapacolmes (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:257-261).
Life during the Spanish Colonial period and post-Pueblo Revolt period is largely characterized by
an increasing European presence. The establishment of Spanish settlements throughout western
Texas and the greater region was largely a successful strategy in the assimilation of indigenous
peoples. Even after the reconquest of New Mexico and the redesignation of Santa Fe as the
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 18

provincial capital in A.D. 1692, El Paso remained an important social and economic center in
western Texas (Chipman.1992:81; Whelan and Dial 2005) In the Rio Grande Valley, villages were
largely concentrated around the established Spanish missions and presidios (Whelan and Dial
2005, Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Burials excavated at the Socorro Mission indicate that the
majority of the individuals came from the local indigenous community (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:262). During this period, prominent sites such as the Ysleta WIS Clinic (41EP2840)
increasingly represent European domesticates including cows, sheep, goat, pigs, and chickens, as
well as wheat grains, alongside traditional subsistence sources (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:262264). In the Trans-Pecos region, the Valle Bajo ceramics prominently represented during this
period reflects the influence of Spanish colonial brownware within indigenous ceramic traditions
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:264).
In the Lower Pecos region colonial settlements were largely unsuccessful. In A.D. 1737 and 1773
attempts were made to establish the Agua Verde presidio along the San Diego River, south of Del
Rio (Turpin 2004:276-277). Both attempts were short lived and the area was largely ignored until
the mid-nineteenth-century when the community of Ciudad AcuÃ±a was founded south of Del Rio
(Turpin 2004). During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Lower Pecos region continued
to be occupied by semi-nomadic hunter-and-gathering groups maintaining a broad subsistence
base (Kenmotsu 2005; Turpin 2004). By the mid-1700âs the Apache were the most prominent
group in the region conducting historic raids against Spanish communities in Coahuila and
Chihuahua as well as the Rio Grande Valley in the Trans-Pecos (Turpin 2004:278; Kenmotsu
2005).
MEXICO AND EARLY STATEHOOD
In A.D. 1821 Mexico gained independence from Spain bringing western Texas under the rule of
the Mexican government, until Texas independence and the Mexican-American war (Whelan and
Dial 2005; Chipman 2005). Neither Mexican independence nor the Texas Revolution in 1836 were
especially apparent in western Texas as the region remained largely self-governed (Rooster
1990:22; Whelan and Dial 2005). The Treaties of Velasco signed at the end of the Texas
Revolution provided a Texan claim for El Paso and territories of western Texas north of the Rio
Grande River. However, the treaties were not completely ratified and the region remained largely
contested until the annexation of Texas by the Unites States in 1845 and the Mexican-American
War (Rooster 1990:26; Whelan and Dial 2005). Conflict between the United States and Mexico
was preceded by a decade of increased American settlement within western Texas. As control of
the Rio Grande River valley was an impetus for the Mexican-American War many of the battles
and skirmishes occurred within the region. With the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, El Paso
and the territory of western Texas north of the Rio Grande officially joined the United States
(Rooster 1990:25-26). Following the war, the United States government established numerous
military outposts to secure the region (Rooster 2003). In the Trans-Pecos region several companies
of the Third US Infantry Battalion established a post in El Paso beginning in 1849 (Rooster
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 19

1990:40). The infantry battalion also occupied the mid-eighteenth-century Presidio de San Elizario
located along the Rio Grande Valley south of El Paso. Both military posts were short lived and in
1851 the soldiers were relocated to Fort Fillmore outside of present-day Las Cruces (Rooster
1990:32; Thomlinson 1945:5-6). In 1854 a subsequent post was established in El Paso which
would become known as Fort Bliss (Thomlinson 1946:7).
THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR
In February of 1861 Texans voted to succeed from the United States, joining the Confederacy in
March (Rooster 1990:146). Western Texas by this time had numerous United States military
outposts including Fort Bliss and Fort Davis both established in the Trans-Pecos in 1854, Fort
Lancaster founded in the Rio Grande Valley in 1855, and Fort Clark founded near Del Rio in 1852
(Rooster 2003). David E. Twiggs, Commander of the United States Army Department of Texas,
ordered all military posts in Texas to surrender to the Confederacy before joining himself
(Thomlinson 1945:13; Rooster 1990:146-147). In July 1861 Confederate forces seized Fort Bliss
securing a significant military post in the region (Thomlinson 1945:13; Rooster 1990:154).
Between 1861 and 1862 Confederate forces based out of Fort Bliss carried out attacks against
Union garrisons in the territories of New Mexico and Arizona (Rooster 1990:154-164).
Confederate attacks out of Fort Bliss were initially successful. In August of 1861, following the
Confederate victory at the First Battle of Mesilla, approximately 35.0 mi (55.0 km) northwest of
El Paso, the Confederate Territory of Arizona was declared, encompassing present day states of
New Mexico and Arizona (Rooster 1990:154). By April of 1862 Confederate forces had retreated
from New Mexico, returning to El Paso (Rooster 1990:163-164). A few months later, the
Confederacy abandoned western Texas altogether, prior to the arrival of the California Column of
the United States Army (Rooster 1990:164; Tomlinson 1945:15). The Union occupied the garrison
at Fort Bliss and maintained control over El Paso and western Texas throughout the remainder of
the Civil War (Thomlinson 1945:15-16).
RANCHING AND INDUSTRIAL ERA
From the end of the Civil War through the early twentieth-century, life in western Texas was
characterized by increasing settlement and mobility in the region. During the second half of the
war, the California Column had occupied the garrison at Fort Bliss. However, many of the frontier
posts remained abandoned. Beginning in 1866 the United States military reoccupied many of these
frontier garrisons, significantly bolstering its presence in the region. In 1866, the historic AfricanAmerican regiments of the Buffalo Soldiers relieved the garrison at Fort Bliss and continued
operating in the region (Thomlinson 1945:17; Rooster 1990:179-185). In 1867 the Ninth Cavalry
of the Buffalo Soldiers began establishing posts in the western Texas interior, rebuilding Fort
Davis, Fort Stockton and Fort Lancaster in the Trans-Pecos region (Rooster 2003). The following
year Buffalo Soldiers relieved the garrison at Fort Clark in the Lower Pecos. This period largely
corresponds to the end of the so-called Texas-Indian Wars and the establishment of early towns.
MarkWest â WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 20

The 1862 Homestead Act made land available throughout western Texas for the burgeoning
ranching industry. Many of the early communities formed in the vicinity of these frontier garrisons
including Saint Gaul (present Fort Stockton) in 1868, as well as Pecos, and Del Rio 1883. The
arrival of the Texas & Pacific and Southern Pacific railroads by 1882 significantly impacted
settlement in the area (Whelan and Dial 2005; Rooster 1990:374)). Over the next decade the
population of El Paso would expand from several hundred to over 10,000 people in 1890 (Whelan
and Dial 2005). Ranching remained the prominent industry through the end of the nineteenthcentury (Cashion 2003). Initially the cattle industry consisted of open-range grazing and the
herding of cattle over long distances to urban centers. The widespread production of barbed wire
after 1873 made the enclosure of large areas of land possible, resulting in the demise of the open
range and the establishment of permanent ranching communities throughout western Texas
(Cashion 2003). The introduction of the railroads in the 1880s made the transportation of cattle to
market more routine and the cattle industry became very profitable. Early rail communities such
as Pecos celebrate rodeos from this period, beginning as early as 1883. In the early twentiethcentury western Texas experienced an additional period of growth following the discovery of oil
in the Permian Basin. In 1927 oil was discovered at the Yates Oil Field near the town of Iraan in
the eastern Trans-Pecos. Between 1925 and 1929 the city of Odessa grew from 750 people to over
5,000. As oil fields across the Permian Basin were developed, the petroleum industry in western
Texas experienced a period of growth that continues into the present.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
Perennial archaeologists conducted a thorough background and archival desktop analysis of the
Permit Area prior to field inventory surveys. The background review determined that there are no
previously recorded sites mapped within, or directly adjacent to the Permit areaTwo previously
recorded sites are mapped within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Permit Area. These sites consist
of a prehistoric lithic scatter (41RV116) and a prehistoric open campsite (41RV107). Site
41RV107 is considered to have an undetermined NRHP eligibility status, while the site 41RV116
was recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL. Neither
of these sites are located within, or directly adjacent to the Permit Area (Atlas 2019). The
background review also determined that no significant portions of the Permit Area overlap with
areas that have been previously surveyed for cultural resources (Appendix B). The single
archaeological investigation that intersects the Permit Area consists of a Phase I survey for a linear
energy infrastructure project. The survey was conducted by Horizon Environmental Services, in
2017 under jurisdiction of the Code (Permit #7648). Site 41RV107, located with the 1.0 -mi (1.6km) review radius, was recorded during this field survey.
FIELD SURVEY
On February 25-27, 2019, two archaeologists carried out an intensive surface and subsurface
cultural resources investigations across the Permit Area (Figure 4). Vegetation across the Permit
Area consisted of typical West Texas scrub vegetation including creosote, sotol, species of cacti
and native grasses. Overall, ground surface visibility was excellent, ranging from 65 to 100
percent. The landscape across the Permit Area consisted of open range typical of upland areas
across West Texas (Figure 2 to Figure 4). Evidence of overland erosion and some disturbances
from existing oil and gas infrastructure was noted across the Permit Area.
Pedestrian survey efforts were initiated within the westernmost GLO tract of the Permit Area. The
field crew traversed the ESA from west to east along evenly spaced transects placed approximately
49.2 ft (15.0 m) apart along the width the ESA. The modern ground survey was carefully examined
for any signs of cultural materials or features present within the ESA. Dense gravels were present
along the ground surface for most of this westernmost tract. The easternmost portion of the Permit
Area contain less gravels present at the surface and the ground visibility was lower than the western
properties, though still approximately 60-75 percent visibility. In addition to a thorough pedestrian
survey in this area, shovel tests were excavated along two transects in this location (Appendix C)
spaced approximately 328.0 to 492.0 ft (100.0 to 150.0 m) apart along the length of each transect
in order to examine the soil profile in this area (Figure 5).

The survey investigations included the excavation of a total of 70 shovel tests, and resulted in the
documentation of two archaeological sites (41RV170 and 41RV171) one isolated find (IF-1). The
two newly recorded sites and IF-1 are discussed separately below (Figure 6).
SITE 41RV170
Setting
Site 41RV70 consists of a prehistoric artifact scatter located approximately 11.0 mi (17.7 km)
southwest of the intersection of US Highway 285 and TX-302 near Mentone, Texas. The cultural
materials scattered across the surface of the site were recorded in a very low density. At the time
of the survey, ground surface visibility was excellent ranging from 80 to 100 percent with dense
gravels at the surface and areas of heavy erosion (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Site 41RV170 was fully
delineated with the boundaries of the ESA (Figure 9).
The soil series mapped within site 41RV170 consist of Delnorte-Chilicotal association, soils,
rolling (NRCS 2019). The Delnorte series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to
petrocalcic. These soils are formed in calcareous loamy materials containing igneous gravel on
nearly level hilly uplands, fan piedmonts, and fan remnants on slopes ranging from 0 to 30
percent. The Chilicotal series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that
formed in loamy gravelly piedmont sediments from igneous mountains. These soils are on gently
undulating to strongly rolling fan remnants and alluvial fans on slopes ranging from 1 to 50 percent
(NRCS 2019). The site is located along a relatively flat upland, at an elevation of 3125.0 ft (952.7
m) above mean sea level (AMSL).
Work Completed
Site 41RV170 was recorded on February 26, 2019. Based upon the excellent ground surface
visibility, the boundaries of site 41RV170 were recorded using pedestrian survey techniques. The
ground surface in the vicinity of the site was traversed in 16.4-ft (5.0-m) interval transects. The
site surface was inspected for the presence of cultural materials, and the site boundary was
determined by the presence of two consecutive negative transects. Additionally, 14 shovel tests
were excavated on the site to look for the presence of buried cultural materials or buried Ahorizons. None of the excavated shovel tests produced evidence of subsurface cultural deposits.
Additionally, cultural materials dispersed along the surface of site 41RV170 appear to be displaced
by surface erosion. Based on the distribution of the materials along the modern ground surface,
site 41RV170 measures approximately 164.0 ft (50.0 m) north to south by 65.6 ft (20.0 m) east to
west. Overall, site 41RV170 covers an area approximately 0.01 ac (0.02 ha).

A typical shovel test soil profile from site 41RV170 is characterized by brown (7.5YR 5/4) very
gravelly loam (0-5 cm below surface) underlain by a very dense brown (7.5YR 5/4) gravelly loam
(5+ below surface). Shovel tests were terminated in this sterile gravelly clay loam, which was
interpreted as the B horizon. This soil profile matches the Delnorte-Chilicotal association very
gravelly clay loam soil unit which underlies the site (NRCS 2019). According to the NRCS Web
Soil Survey (2019), the B-horizon for this soil unit is encountered at approximately five
centimeters below surface. These observations coupled with good surface visibility and a lack of
positive shovel tests (n=14) indicates that the potential for deeply buried cultural deposits at site
41RV170 is low. Appendix C provides the soils profiles for the shovel test excavated at the site.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials recovered from site 41RV170 consist of non-diagnostic lithic debris.
Approximately six prehistoric lithic artifacts were observed along the modern ground surface of
the site. These include two secondary and four tertiary flakes. Representative photographs are
presented in Figure 10 and Figure 11. These materials were manufactured from medium-grained
tan chert. No temporally diagnostic tools fragments were observed on site 41RV170.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed along the modern ground surface or within any of the 14 shovel
tests excavated across the site. Additionally, no evidence of any thermally altered stone specimens,
surface staining, or charcoal flecks were in the vicinity of the lithic specimens to suggest the
presence of a possible hearth location.
Recommendations
Site 41RV170 is a low-density scatter of prehistoric lithic artifacts of unknown cultural affiliation.
The site is limited to a surficial context with shovel tests at the site revealing highly deflated soils
that are lacking of any soil stratification which may indicate buried archaeological deposits or
cultural horizons. Although the artifact assemblage observed at 41RV170 likely represents the
remains of a temporary activity area associated with the upland plain setting, lithic artifacts present
over the modern ground surface are entirely non-diagnostic and have been displaced by prolonged
exposure and erosion. As such no cultural affiliation or period of production can be determined
beyond a broadly prehistoric period.
Due to the low-density of artifacts present across the site and the absence of diagnostic cultural
materials or intact features, the artifact assemblage observed at site 41RV170 provides little to no
insight into the function or occupational history of the site. The limited prehistoric data present
does not possess significant research potential and is unlikely to enhance an understanding of the
regionâs prehistory. In the absence of diagnostic cultural material and intact features or
archaeological deposits, it is Perennialâs opinion that 41RV170 does not meet the criteria for
inclusion within the NRHP or formal designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended on
site 41RV170 in conjunction with the current Project.

SITE 41RV171
Setting
Site 41RV71 consists of a prehistoric artifact scatter located approximately 11.0 mi (17.7 km)
southwest of the intersection of US Highway 285 and TX-302 near Mentone, Texas. The cultural
materials scattered across the surface of the site were recorded in a very low density. At the time
of the survey, ground surface visibility was excellent ranging from 80 to 100 percent with dense
gravels at the surface and areas of heavy erosion (Figure 12). Site 41RV171 was fully delineated
with the boundaries of the proposed ESA (Figure 13).
The soil series mapped within site 41RV171 consist of Delnorte-Chilicotal association, soils,
rolling (NRCS 2016). The Delnorte series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to
petrocalcic. These soils are formed in calcareous loamy materials containing igneous gravel on
nearly level hilly uplands, fan piedmonts, and fan remnants on slopes ranging from 0 to 30
percent. The Chilicotal series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that
formed in loamy gravelly piedmont sediments from igneous mountains. These soils are on gently
undulating to strongly rolling fan remnants and alluvial fans on slopes ranging from 1 to 50 percent
(NRCS 2019). The site is located along a relatively flat upland, at an elevation of 3125.0 ft (952.7
m) AMSL.
Work Completed
Site 41RV171 was recorded on February 26, 2019. Based upon the excellent ground surface
visibility, the boundaries of site 41RV171 were recorded using pedestrian survey techniques. The
ground surface in the vicinity of the site was traversed in 16.4-ft (5.0-m) interval transects. The
site surface was inspected for the presence of cultural materials. The site boundary was determined
by the presence of two consecutive negative transects. Additionally, 16 shovel tests were excavated
on the site to look for the presence of buried cultural materials or buried A-horizons. None of the
excavated shovel tests produced evidence of subsurface cultural deposits. Additionally, cultural
materials are dispersed along the surface of site 41RV171 appear to be displaced by surface
erosion. Based on the distribution of the materials along the modern ground surface, site 41RV171
measures approximately 131.2 ft (40 m) north to south by 262.4 ft (80 m) east to west. Overall,
site 41RV171 covers an area approximately 0.04 ac (0.02 ha).
Like site 41RV170, a typical shovel test soil profile from site 41RV171 is characterized by brown
(7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly loam (0-5 cm below surface) underlain by a very dense brown (7.5YR
5/4) gravelly loam (5+ below surface). Shovel tests were terminated in this sterile clay loam,
which was interpreted as the B horizon. This soil profile matches the Delnorte-Chilicotal
association very gravelly clay loam soil unit which underlies the site (NRCS 2019).

Figure 12. General view of site 41RV171, facing west.

According to the NRCS Web Soil Survey (2019), the B-horizon for this soil unit is encountered at
approximately five centimeters below surface. These observations coupled with good surface
visibility and a lack of positive shovel tests (n=16) indicates that the potential for deeply buried
cultural deposits at site 41RV171 is low. Appendix C provides the soils profiles for the shovel tests
excavated at the site.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials recovered from site 41RV171 consist entirely of lithic materials.
Approximately six prehistoric lithic artifacts were observed along the modern ground surface of
site 41RV171. These include two primary flakes, three secondary, and one biface fragment (Figure
14 to Figure 16). One trowel test was conducted near the biface fragment, however no evidence
of any intact assemblage was observed (Figure 17). Additionally, no temporally diagnostic tools
fragments were observed on site 41RV171.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed along the modern ground surface or within any of the 16 shovel
tests excavated across the site. Additionally, no evidence of any thermally altered stone specimens,
surface staining, or charcoal flecks were in the vicinity of the lithic specimens to suggest the
presence of a possible hearth location.

Site 41RV171 is a low-density scatter of prehistoric lithic artifacts of unknown cultural affiliation.
The site is limited to a surficial context with shovel tests at the site revealing highly deflated soils

inclusion within the NRHP or formal designation as a SAL. No further work is recommended on
site 41RV171in conjunction with the current Project.
IF-1
The investigations resulted in the documentation of a single isolated find along the eastern portion
of the Permit Area (Appendix C; see Figure 6). IF-1 consisted of a prehistoric metate fragment
observed on the modern ground surface. The areas surrounding IF-1 has excellent ground visibility
(Figure 18). Five shovel tests and one trowel test were excavated in the vicinity of IF-1, all of
which were negative for any cultural resources. One shovel test and one trowel test (Figure 19)
were excavated at the center point of the find, and four additional tests were excavated (one in
each cardinal direction) at 32.8-ft (10.0-m) intervals surrounding the find. The IF identified during
the survey efforts consist of a singular surficial artifact in an isolated context. Shovel testing and
pedestrian surveys in the immediate vicinity of this did not document any additional artifacts or
features; and as such, the find was not recorded as an archaeological site and no further work is
warranted. IF-1 was not collected, but rather photographed and left in place. A photograph of the
IF can be found in Figure 20.

RECOMMENDATIONS
MarkWest is proposing to construct the WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project (Project), in Reeves
County, Texas. Ground disturbing activities associated with Project include clearing of existing
vegetation, grading, and excavation within a defined construction ROW.
To provide flexibility to MarkWest during workspace design, Perennial conducted survey efforts
within a broader ESA that totaled approximately 61.68 acres. Actual Project impacts will be
restricted to a smaller workspace, the limits of which will be determined following engineering
analysis. Depths of impact associated with the actual APE are anticipated to range from 3.0 to 6.0
ft (0.9 to 1.8 m). Jennifer Cochran served as the Principal Investigator (PI) for the Project and
Sarah Boudreaux and Clay Taylor assisted with the field efforts on February 25 to 27, 2019.
The survey investigations included the excavation of a total of 70 shovel tests, and resulted in the
documentation of two archaeological sites (41RV170 and 41RV171) one isolated find (IF-1).
Based upon the solitary nature of IF-1, this artifact was not formally recorded as an archeological
site and does not require further assessment. Sites 41RV170 and 41RV171 consist of prehistoric
lithic scatters entirely confined to the modern ground surface. Artifacts were observed in low
quantities across the surface of each site. No temporally diagnostic stone tools, cultural features,
or intact cultural deposits were observed on either site. Based on the lack of significant, intact

cultural deposits, it is Perennialâs opinion that sites 41RV170 and 41RV171 be considered ad not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or designation as a SAL. No further work is being
recommended for sites 41RV107 and 41RV171 in conjunction the Project
Based on the results of the survey effort, no intact, significant cultural resources will be affected
by any construction activities within the Permit Area. In accordance with the Code, Perennial
recommends no further cultural resources investigations within the 61.68-acre ESA.
Should historic properties and/or human remains be encountered during construction, work in the
immediate area will cease and a qualified archaeologist will be called to evaluate the finding(s)
and provide recommendations for how to manage the resource under the State Historic
Preservation Plan. All findings will be reported to, and activities coordinated with the appropriate
interested parties. In the event that human remains are encountered, all activity that might disturb
the remains shall cease, and may not resume until authorized by appropriate law enforcement,
and/or the THC.

Introduction
MarkWest Energy West Texas Gas Company, L.L.C. (MarkWest) is proposing to construct the
WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project (Project), an approximate 15.5-mile- (mi-) (24.9- kilometer[km-]), intrastate natural gas pipeline, in Reeves County, Texas (Project) (Attachment 1). Ground
disturbing activities associated with Project include clearing of existing vegetation, grading, and
excavation within a defined construction right-of-way (ROW).
While the majority of the Project will traverse private property, three discontinuous segments
totaling 5.6 mi (9.01 km) will cross state-owned property (see Attachment 1). The area of potential
effect (APE) associated with the Project across these properties measure approximately 68 acres
with depths of impact ranging from 4.0 to 6.0 feet (ft) (1.2 to 1.8 meters [m]) below ground surface.
As these properties, designated herein as the Permit Area, are owned by the Texas General Land
Office (GLO), cultural resources investigations will be conducted to satisfy the requirements of
the Antiquities Code of Texas (Code). The following scope of work outlines the proposed Phase
I survey plan for the portion of the Project that traverses this Permit Area.
Environmental Setting
The Permit Area is located approximately 16.6 mi (26.7 km) northwest of Pecos, Texas.
According to aerial imagery and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps, the state lands
appear to be situated within an erosional setting with disturbances present along the Permit Area
from a past oil and gas activities. Topography across the Permit Area consists of rolling uplands
with vegetation typical of the Trans-Pecos ecoregion (TPWD 2019). Much of the landscape is
dominated by desert grassland, but many of the native grasses have been replaced by scrub
vegetation as a result of overgrazing. Based upon recent aerial imagery, surface ground visibility
appears good to excellent. Landscape alterations caused by prolific oil and gas development are
prevalent across much of this region.
Geologically, the Permit Area is underlain by Alluvium Deposits (Qal) and Older Alluvial
Deposits (Qao) (USGS 2019). Older Terrace Deposits consist of alluvium, colluvium, and caliche
with pebbles, cobbles, large boulders, and sand present within these deposits. Typically, these
deposits date to the Pleistocene age. Alluvium deposits consist of sand, silt, clay, and gravels with
calcium carbonate (caliche) deposits in terraces along streams. These deposits typically date to
the Holocene age.
Three soil types are mapped within the Permit Area, including Delnorte-Chilicotol association,
rolling (12), Hoban-Reeves-Holloman association, nearly level (17), and Reakor association,
nearly level (32). The Delnorte series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to petrocalcic.
These soils are formed in calcareous loamy materials containing igneous gravel on nearly level
hilly uplands, fan piedmonts, and fan remnants on slopes ranging from 0 to 30 percent. The
WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 1

Chilicotal series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in
loamy gravelly piedmont sediments from igneous mountains. These soils are on gently undulating
to strongly rolling fan remnants and alluvial fans on slopes ranging from 1 to 50 percent. The
Reakor series are very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium derived from mixed
sources. Reakor soils are on broad plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent. The
Hoban series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous
loamy or clayey alluvium. These soils are on broad, nearly level to very gently sloping valleys,
alluvial outwash plains or broad basins on slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent. The Reeves series
consists of very deep soils that are moderately deep to gypsum material. These soils are well
drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous and gypsiferous fine textured
alluvium derived from gypsum beds on hillslopes, plateaus, and basin floors on slopes ranging
from 0 to 9 percent. The Holloman series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained,
moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous, and gypsiferous sediments.
Holloman soils are located on basins, valley floors or adjacent terraces and have slopes that range
from 0 to 50 percent. (NRCS 2019).
Cultural Resources Background Review Results
Perennial conducted a thorough cultural resources and environmental literature search of the
Permit Area. A Perennial archaeologist reviewed the Pecos, Texas USGS 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle map and searched the Texas Historical Commissionâs (THC) Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) online database and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) database to
identify previously recorded cultural resource sites, historic structures, properties listed in the
NRHP, designated historic districts and State Antiquities Landmark (SAL)s which could
potentially be affected by the proposed undertaking. Any previously recorded cultural resource
site forms, reports of archaeological investigations, general historical documents, and secondary
sources concerning the background of the area were also reviewed. The records search included
a review of all previously recorded site forms, cemetery data, and surveys on file within a 1.0-mi
(1.6-km) review radius of the Permit Area.
Based upon the archival review, no previously recorded archeological sites or cemeteries are
mapped within 1.0-mi (1.6-km) of the Permit Area (Atlas 2019). Six sites were recorded with 1.0mile (1.6-km) of the Project. Three of these sites consist of prehistoric lithic procurement sites
(41RV112, 41RV113, and 41RV114), one site consists of a prehistoric lithic scatter (41RV116),
one site consists of a prehistoric open campsite (41RV107), and the remaining site consists of a
historic-age artifact scatter (41RV96). Site 41RV107 is considered to have an undetermined
NRHP eligibility status, while the remaining five sites were recommended as not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as a SAL.
Previously Conducted Surveys
The background review also determined that no significant portions of the proposed corridor
overlap with areas that have been previously surveyed for cultural resources (see Attachment 1).
The single archaeological investigation that intersects the Permit Area consists of a Phase I survey

for a linear energy infrastructure project. The survey was conducted by SWCA in 2017 under
jurisdiction of the Code. Sites 41RV112, 41RV113, and 41RV114, located with the 1.0 -mi (1.6km) review radius, were recorded during this field survey.

Field Methods
The cultural resources survey will be performed by a team of two archaeologists. The field crew
will survey the entire 5.6-mi (9.01-km) segment of the Project length located within the Permit
Area. In general, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require
that a minimum of 16 shovel tests be excavated per 1.0 mi (1.6 km) for ROWs measuring up to
100.0 ft (30.0 m) in width (1 survey transect). The proposed survey corridor for the Permit Area
within the Project will measure approximately 200.0 ft (61.0 m) in width and will require two
evenly spaced survey transects in order to conform to TSMASS. Overall, the survey will cover
100 percent of the Project length for areas located across the Permit Area. An intensive pedestrian
survey will be conducted at survey intervals no greater than 91.5 ft (30.0 m) apart along the width
of the Permit Area. In areas where the ground visibility is less than 50 percent, shovel tests will
be excavated at 164.0 to 328.0-ft (50.0 to 100.0-m) intervals apart along the length of the Permit
Area. In areas where the surface visibility exceeds 50 percent, shovel testing will be conducted
intermittently along areas with increased probability to contain buried cultural deposits, such as
areas adjacent to drainages or within sand dunes. Additional shovel tests may be excavated in
portions of the Permit Area with distinct landforms. In areas where landforms exhibit moderateto-extensive disturbances from natural or human-induced processes such as shallow surface
plowing, land clearing, and minor channelization, shovel tests may be excavated on a discretionary
basis. Any deviations from TSMASS will be thoroughly documented, and disturbances will be
photographed.
In general, shovel tests will measure approximately 12.0 in (30.0 cm) in diameter and will be
excavated by natural strata. Per the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)/THC survey standards,
WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 3

shovel tests will be excavated to a depth consistent with the Project impacts or to the base of
Holocene deposits likely to contain cultural resources unless dense, impenetrable clay soils or
inundation prevent the continuation of excavations. All soil matrices will be screened through 6.3millimeter (Â¼-inch) mesh hardware cloth unless dominated by clay. Clayey matrix will be trowelsorted and visually inspected.
For each of the shovel tests, the following information will be recorded on shovel test logs:
location, maximum depth, and the number of soil strata. For each soil stratum, thickness, texture,
color, and the presence or absence and nature of cultural materials will be recorded. Perennial will
maintain a non-collection policy whereby all diagnostic artifacts will be photo-documented, while
only representative samples of non-diagnostic materials will be photographed by artifact class for
each site. Field data will be collected on the spatial distribution of artifacts, artifact concentrations,
and densities of surface assemblages across all of the sites. Diagnostic artifacts such as projectile
points will be typed in the field to the best extent possible based on defining characteristics, design,
and a comparative analysis of comparable assemblages in the region.
The field crew will record all shovel test locations, isolated finds, archaeological sites and
associated features using a handheld GPS device. Also, each archaeologist will be equipped with
a compass, shovel test and photographic logs, daily journal forms, and appropriate THC site forms.
The crew will be equipped with topographic maps and aerial photographs of the survey corridor,
a digital camera, and a cellular telephone to maintain contact with the home office (terrain
permitting).
If necessary, in addition to shovel testing, a hand-operated auger will be utilized in select locales
with deep alluvium or colluvium or known archaeological site deposits to probe for deeply buried
cultural materials below shovel testing capabilities (i.e, 3.3 ft [1.0 m]). If the auger probes reveal
that buried horizons or evidence of cultural materials are present at depths below shovel testing
capabilities, then additional work in the form of backhoe trenching would be utilized to adequately
assess these deposits. In practice, survey crews will flag any areas where deep alluvial or colluvial
sediments exists deeper than depths capable of being excavated with shovel testing efforts.
Mechanical trenching of cultural resources sites or survey areas with deep deposits present is not
currently proposed for this phase of the project. No areas of substantial alluvial deposits with the
potential to contain buried cultural deposits are anticipated with the Permit Area. However, if
deep, alluvial or colluvial settings are identified during survey efforts, an additional mobilization
to the Permit Area will be necessary to evaluate these areas for the potential of deeply buried
cultural deposits.
If an archaeological site is identified, the appropriate delineation techniques will be systematically
applied to identify the horizontal and vertical limits of each siteâs boundary. Site boundaries may
be determined based on both surface artifact density and the presence or lack of subsurface
components. For subsurface sites, a series of shovel tests will be excavated radiating in the four
cardinal directions or, if more appropriate, along perceived major and minor topographic and site
WXP Interconnect Pipeline Project

Page 4

axes. In practice, shovel tests within potential sites will be placed along transects at 33.0-foot
(10.0-meter) intervals to determine the depth and potential integrity of cultural deposits, and to
carefully examine for the presence of intact archaeological features and/or discrete episodes of
occupation. In the absence of subsurface deposits, controlled pedestrian surface inspections will
be conducted and site boundaries defined based on a marked reduction in surface artifact density.
For all sites, a minimum of six shovel tests will be excavated across each site (more for larger
sites) regardless of surface visibility unless bedrock is clearly present across the entirely of the site.
Shovel testing or pedestrian surveys will not be conducted beyond the Project boundary to ensure
no trespassing onto private property occurs.
Historic Structure Documentation
All historic-age structures (i.e., older than 50 years) located within the Permit Area will be
thoroughly documented during the survey efforts. Historic Standing Structure forms will be
completed for each resource. The historic structures will be adequately photo-documented, sketch
maps will be drawn, and each resource will be plotted with a GPS device. Shovel tests may be
excavated in the vicinity of the structures to determine if an associated subsurface archaeological
component is present. All data will be reviewed by a qualified architectural historian to determine
construction date, style, integrity, and overall significance and SAL designation.
Reporting
Following the completion of the field surveys, Perennial will prepare a draft report of the
investigations. Data on any newly recorded sites will be submitted to the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in order to receive trinomial data for reporting. The format of the
report will adhere to review guidelines suitable to the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)
in accordance with the THCâs Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the
CTA Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. The report will document previous
investigations in the area, background cultural setting, the methodology used during the
investigations, the general nature and extent of cultural resources encountered during the cultural
resource survey, and management recommendations for any documented cultural resources per all
applicable state and federal laws. A complete draft report will be submitted to MarkWest for
comments and review. Once the client approves the report, the draft report will be submitted to
the THC for review. Following the agency review period, any appropriate edits or comments will
be incorporated, and a final draft will be produced and distributed appropriately.
Laboratory Methods
Perennial will maintain a non-collection policy whereby all diagnostic artifacts will be photodocumented, while only representative samples of non-diagnostic materials will be photographed
by artifact class for each site. Field data will be collected on the spatial distribution of artifacts,
artifact concentrations, and densities of surface assemblages across all of the sites. Diagnostic
artifacts such as projectile points will be typed in the field to the best extent possible based on
defining characteristics, design, and a comparative analysis of comparable assemblages in the
region.

Perennial will prepare all materials recovered during the study and arrange for the transfer of
recovered materials and records to a suitable curatorial facility pursuant to the standards and
guidelines set forth by the THC/CTA. An additional ten copies will be distributed to various
designated repositories across the state in accordance with the TAC permit obligations.
Human Remains
In the event that human remains are encountered during any part of the Phase I survey effort, work
will stop immediately and the appropriate local law enforcement personnel and medical
examinerâs office will be notified of the discovery. Should the medical examiner determine that
the human remains are older than 50 years, then the State Archeologist will claim jurisdiction of
the discovery and will commence consultation with any concerned parties including landowners,
appropriate Tribes, and living descendants to ensure compliance with existing state laws. No
remains will be removed from the site until jurisdiction has been established and the appropriate
permits have been obtained. All activities will adhere to the Texas Health and Safety Code (8
THSC Â§ 711.010) and the Texas Antiquities Code (13 TAC Â§Â§ 22.1-22.6). If the human remains
are determined to be Native American, they will be handled in accordance with the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA).
