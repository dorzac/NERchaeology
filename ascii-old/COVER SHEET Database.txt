Cell: A6
Comment: B1:
Stature estimate based on complete tibia and segemnts of femur equals a range of 5'5" to 5'7" for this individual. Sex assessed based on long bone metrics and talus and calcaneus
regression equations. Age based on pubic symphysis morphology, general arthritic changes, and bone quality. The pubic symphysis is the site of a bone cyst that may have caused
changes indicating an age greater than that attained by the individual. Therefore, I have left the age in the indeterminate adult category.
Cell: A7
Comment: B002:
No bone recovered.
Cell: A8
Comment: B3:
Only the legs and feet were preserved in this individual with the exception of a humerus fragment. Metric analysis suggests that the individual was a female. Age assessment was based on
fused epiphyses of the long bone. Stature appears to have been between 5'2" and 5'5".
Cell: A11
Comment: B6:
No zones - "highly disturbed area" marked on each bag.
Cell: A13
Comment: B8:
Photo the focal pressure necrosis on the right and left femoral heads. Probable Treponematosis- bone coloration and fragmentation prevents photographic documentation. Probable cause
of death= gunshot wound to the chest.
Cell: A16
Comment: B011:
No bone recovered.
Cell: A17
Comment: B012:
No bone recovered.
Cell: A20
Comment: B15:
Assessed as possible AA due to dental crenulations.
Cell: A22
Comment: B17:
This material had no zone and was apparently highly disturbed (marked "disturbed burial" on bag).
Cell: A24
Comment: B19:
Dental development is 1 year +/- 4 months.

Femur circumference indicates male, but just barely. Subjectively, the femurs look fairly gracile for this pop., so it may be female. This burial has a unique pattern of periostitis on the

Not enough of this person is present to determine sex. The femoral shaft circumf. Suggests female, but only barely. The chin is weakly developed but the alveolus is highly resorbed, which

Age judgement based on edentulism, OA in vertebral joints, and suture closure. Overall robustness of bones (eg. Femur circumference) was used for sex estimation. Teeth were covered in

These highly fragmented remains probably represent a young female. Age assessment based on dentition. Only slight to moderate wear on the teeth. Third molars erupted but barely in

the femur. An earring was found near the head. Crenulations on the molars are suggestive of African American ancestry.

The amount of wear on the teeth suggest that this individual was young. Yet, all visible epiphyses are fused, indicating that the individual was at least in the very late teen years. Sex
assessment based on dental metrics, long bone metrics and general muscle robusticity. The dental hypoplasias are indicative of at least two developmental growth arrests. Left upper
second molar has a distal wear facet - indicates an occluded third molar. The lower right second molar has crenulated cusps - possible African American.

Comment: B73:
The epiphyses that are present in these remains are fused, indicating that the individual was (at the youngest) in the late teen age bracket. The teeth show very little wear, especially the first
molar and the mandibular P-4s which are almost pristine and may have seen little use. The baso-occipital is youthful looking and was probably not fused to the sphenoid. This individual
was very sick, having experienced developmental difficulties as a child as evidenced by hypoplastic lines on the teeth, anemia resulting in cribra orbitalia, and widespread systemic infection
(probable treponematosis) resulting in periostitis and osteomyelitis of all long bones. Sex is based on tooth measurement and may not be reliable because so few teeth are present. Long
bones are gracile but that could be a function of age or chronic illness. The molar has a "mulberry look." Assessed as possible AA due to dental crenulations.

Although few postcranial remains were present, the dentition was relatively complete. The tooth size as well as tooth size relationships based on the dental equations indicate that the

of robust musculature. The "old subadult" classification is based on degree of suture closure (estimated from fragments), dental wear of a single tooth, and arthritic development. Also see
field form for in situ non-metric sex assessment.

This woman's cranial sutures, mandible, and osteoporotic bone texture suggest that she is rather old, however, her teeth (except mandibular left M2) show almost no wear. This makes me
wonder if maybe she was an invalid for much of her life (e.g. eating soft foods). The number of caries she has may support this idea. Also, while the legs appear to have been osteoporotic
(possibly wasted?), the arms appear gracile but normal. Ulna and fadius have fairly pronounced interosseous crests.

No metric or non-metric sex assessment was possible for this person due to fragmentary nature of the remains. From a cultural standpoint, the amount of gold bridgework and fillings

Sex for this individual is based on long bone measurements, shape of the mandible, and general robusticity. Age estimation is based on osteoarthritic degeneration, tooth wear, and general
bone quality, as well as cranial suture closure. This individual had increased muscle development in the palms and fingers of both hands - possibly on indication of repeated use in some
form of labor. the dentition is quite decayed with multiple gross caries present. He may have been about 5'3", although this is an estimation and may be underestimating his full height.

This individual exhibited very light wear on the dentition but the third molar on the right side was in occlusion with subtle wear facets present. Age assessment was based on tooth eruption

metrics. Femoral circumference is in the male range. Sciatic notch was wide but damaged. Since the individual was found with a male cuffhoder, a sex assessment of male was made.
there is no evidence of trauma. The left femur was thickened endosteally and tere was slight periosteal deposition on the lateral and medial surfaces.

Comment: B328:
Assessed as possible AA due to dental crenulations. This burial is problematic in that it was highly disturbed and much of the skeletal material was found on the surface. There are some
faunal elements mixed in but they are highly fragmented. The dental age of the individual appears to fall into the 6-8 year range but an upper lateral deciduous incisor may have been
retained. However, there are humeral and femoral fragments that appear too small to belong to a child from that age category. Threre fore, I am suggesting that this could also be a
commingled burial with elements from two young individuals.

Comment: B329:
An upper denture plate is present with this individual. The dentures are vulcanized rubber with what appears to be plastic pink gum inserts in which the teeth were set. The teeth are
probably porcelain material, very small, and are not anatomically correct for upper teeth. Very little other material is present. The fragment of the sciatic notch is not diagnostic but appears
wide. The dentures are quite small. Although dentures from the time period tended to be small, these procelain teeth appear quite delicate. The femur circumference is at an estimated
midshaft and may not accurately reflect femoral size. muscle attachment areas are not particularly strong on the arm elements. No evidence of arthritic changes were present. Bone texture
is suggestive of an older individual.
