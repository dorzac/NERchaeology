Abstract
The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) proposes to construct a new transmission line the will run
for approximately 38 miles through western Tom Green and northern Schleicher counties, Texas. It will
start at the existing Twin Buttes substation, located just northwest of San Angelo, and run generally south,
primarily through ranchland, and across some agricultural areas until it enters the new Big Hill
Substation, located in northern Schleicher County. No urban zones are affected.
The results of an intensive cultural resources report are reported upon. A total of 52.35 miles was
ultimately assessed, due to approximately 14 miles of rerouted line portions proposed during project
development. Final design changes moved some portions of the line away from areas considered to have
a high probability for containing cultural resources. Of the 52.35 assessed miles, 15.50 miles, or 29.6
percent, were physically surveyed as high probability area. Although not quantified, a much higher
percentage of the project also received windshield survey, mostly while traveling between or to high
probability areas. The final alignment is approximately 37.79 miles in length.
Thirty-five previously unrecorded archaeological sites were documented. One previously recorded
archaeological site was re-assessed, and one previously recorded archaeological site was revisited, but not
re-assessed. Of the total 37 archaeological sites, there are four historic components, two of which are
single component historical sites. There are 35 prehistoric components.
The historic components date as early as the 1890s and as late as the 1940s or 1950s, and consist of three
house sites and a portion of an irrigation system. Prehistoric sites consist of open camp sites, lithic
scatters, and lithic procurement sites. There are three burned rock midden sites, one of which also
contains bedrock mortar holes and petroglyphs. Time-diagnostic artifacts are primarily Late Archaic in
age, although Late Prehistoric, Middle Archaic, and Early Archaic time periods are also represented.
Five sites with prehistoric components are considered to be either eligible or potentially eligible for
formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks or nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places. Site 41TG630 is an open camp with buried cultural material and organic preservation. Site
41TG640 contains a burned rock midden, bedrock mortar holes and petroglyphs. Site 41TG642 is a large
burned rock midden that although has surficial disturbance may have intact subsurface deposits. Site
41TG648 is a buried burned rock feature that appears to be intact. Site 41TG660 is a discrete hearth or
oven complex that creates an incipient burned rock midden. The locations of all these sites have been
accounted for in transmission line design, construction, and future maintenance needs. Impacts that could
potentially affect the research or interpretive potential of these five sites have been minimized or avoided.
The remaining 32 archaeological sites are considered fully recorded and to be not eligible for formal State
Archeological Landmarks status or nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. It is
recommended that the project be allowed to proceed in all areas, allowing for the restrictions described
below.

Introduction and Management Summary
The Lower Colorado River Authority’s Transmission Services Corporation (LCRA TSC) has proposed to
build a new transmission line to meet an order of the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (PUCT) to
work within one of the five mandated Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (CREZ) designed to
transmit wind-generated power from collection areas in west, west-central and the Panhandle portions of
Texas to metropolitan need centers located in more easterly areas of the state. The CREZ projects,
combined, are expected to increase the wind-production capacity of Texas by 18, 456 megawatts (MW)
(PUCT 2010a). As much as 2,300 miles of new 345 kilovolt (kV) may be built to accommodate the
increased load (Daniel et. al 2010).
Within the West Texas CREZ Region, the PUCT ordered that a new transmission line be built between
the existing Twin Buttes substation, located just northwest of San Angelo in Tom Green County, to a
soon-to-be-built substation located approximately 2.7 miles south of the Tom Green County line in
northern Schleicher County. This substation was originally called McCamey D, but will be permanently
named the Big Hill Substation. The final alignment is a modification of one of eight routes that were
combined by numerous segments (PBS&J 2010) and is now known as Route TM9 (Figure 1, Figures 211).
Route TM9 is approximately 38 miles in length. It runs south from the Twin Buttes substation, crossing
Hwy 853 and then Hwy 67 before paralleling Hwy 2335 and then turning slightly eastward towards Hwy
277. The Big Hill Substation is located off of CR 431 very near its intersection with Hwy 277. The
transmission line will cross the Middle Concho River, Spring Creek, Dove Creek, Burks Creek and Bois
d’Arc Draw as well as other smaller drainages. It passes through the named community of Tankersley
and very near the community of Knickerbocker. The vast majority of the line is through open ranchland,
with some smaller areas that are under cultivation, mostly in the Knickerbocker area.
The right-of-way (ROW) will be 140 feet wide, except for a 1,200 ft-long section near Dove Creek, which
will be 200 ft wide. Structures will be between 120 and 180 ft tall, except for the above-mentioned 200
ft. wide ROW, where structures will be 100 ft tall in order to accommodate a nearby private airstrip.
Most structures will be metal lattice towers, which require four foundation footings approximately 2 ft in
diameter excavated to depths of 10 to 20 ft below the ground surface. An as-yet undetermined number of
structures will be single poles, either metal or concrete, which may be as large as 10 ft in diameter and
will be placed in holes or upon prepared foundations excavated to depths of up to 25 ft. The placement of
structures has not been determined as of the date of this report, but they are typically placed between 800
and 1,600 feet apart.
Because the PUCT (2010b) has ordered that if “LCRA TSC or its contractors encounter any artifacts or
other cultural resources during project construction, work shall cease immediately in the vicinity of the
resource and the discovery shall be reported to the Texas Historical Commission (THC),” and because
LCRA is a political subdivision of the State of Texas and therefore required by the Antiquities Code of
Texas to conduct a cultural resources assessment of ground-disturbing activities on lands owned or
controlled by the entity, and because it has been determined that the project should be considered a
federal undertaking due to the issuance of a Section 10(a)(1)(b) endangered species incidental take permit
from the U. S. Department of Fish and Wildlife, a cultural resources assessment consisting of a field
survey of high probability areas was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resources staff under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) Permit No. 5727, issued by the Texas Historical Commission on August
18, 2010. The survey was conducted to identify and evaluate archaeological resources that might be
eligible for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) or placement on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

The cultural resources survey was designed to conform to minimum survey standards as developed by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and adopted by the THC (2010a). The reporting conforms to
CTA guidelines (THC 2010b). The bulk of field investigations took place in August and September,
2010, with additional visits in October of 2010 and February and May of 2011. LCRA Staff
Archaeologist Andrew F. Malof served as Principal Investigator and Project Archaeologist. The field
crew consisted variously of LCRA Program Manager Daniel J. Prikryl and contracted archaeologists
Charles Hixson, Patrick Hatten, Cody Kiker, George Thomas, Christine Gauger and LCRA equipment
operators Ed Castro and William Bergquist. Approximately 1,350 person-hours were spent during
fieldwork. State of Texas site forms were completed by Malof and Hixson. Andrew Malof drafted the
figures and authored the report.

In anticipation of federal level Section 106 review a visual impacts study was commissioned and
conducted by staff from PBS&J. This assessment was conducted for a distance of one-half mile from the
centerline of the proposed transmission line and from various centerline adjustments as proposed. PBS&J
used recent and historical maps and aerials as well as on-the-ground survey to determine if any standing
structures or potential historic landscapes would be impacted by the transmission line construction. The
visual impact study will be included as an appendix to the final version of this report.
Approximately 13.25 miles of the 38 total miles (37 percent) were identified as having a high probability
for containing cultural resources potentially eligible for state of federal designations, based on review of
topographic, historic, geologic and soils maps and literature. After approximately 17 miles of route
adjustments were considered, the high probability area total was 16.3 miles. A total of 294 shovel or
auger tests (subsurface tests) and 13 backhoe trenches were excavated during the project. Many of the
high probability areas identified in the lab were found in the field to not require subsurface testing due to
exposures, levels of disturbance, lack of soil, and other factors. Other areas were tested more extensively
due to lack of visibility and/or depth of soils. Some subsurface testing occurred where potential reroutes
required timely assessment, but either the proposed reroute or the original route will not actually be
impacted following final design. The overall rate of testing for the areas surveyed is approximately 18
tests per linear mile, exceeding minimum survey standards, and the level of testing is considered adequate
for this project.
As a result of the archaeological survey, 35 previously undocumented sites (41TG626-41TG658,
41TG660, 41SL30) were recorded, and two previously recorded sites (41TG278, 41TG577) was revisited.
The vast majority of sites were prehistoric in age, and most of those are described as lithic scatters, often
reflecting the acquisition of chert from resource locations for the production of stone tools. Notable
prehistoric sites included open camp 41TG630, located on the north bank of Spring Creek, burned rock
midden site 41TG642 and buried burned rock feature 41TG648, both located on the east bank of Dove
Creek, petroglyph/mortar hole/burned rock midden site 41TG640 and the nearby burned rock midden
41TG660. Only four historic components were recorded: 41TG635, a multicomponent home site
associated with the Tankersley Ranch; 41TG631, a 1950s-era house located on the large Bryant Ranch;
41TG634, a turn-of-the-century homesite located on what is now the Cauble Ranch; and a cement feature
related to farm irrigation at 41TG647, also on the Cauble property.
Of the 36 recorded archaeological sites, five (41TG630, 41TG640, 41TG642, 41TG648 and 41TG660)
are considered to require avoidance by construction and future maintenance impacts. Sites 41TG630,
41TG642, 41TG648 and 41TG660 are felt to be inadequately investigated at the survey level such that
their eligibility for formal listing as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) or nomination to the national
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) status is unknown. If construction or other future regulatory-eligible
impacts to these sites become unavoidable, then additional testing and/or mitigation should be considered.
Site 41TG640 is considered to be eligible for formal listing as an SAL and for nomination to the NRHP.
Ground disturbing activities, when conducted under state or federal purview will require complete
avoidance of eligible portions of this site. If avoidance becomes impossible, than mitigation measures
should be coordinated with the appropriate agency.
The remaining sites, 41TG577, 41TG626-41TG629, 41TG631-41TG639, 41TG641-41TG647, 41TG64941TG656, and 41SL30, are considered to be fully investigated within and near the transmission line
corridor, and are not felt to be eligible for SAL or NRHP status. It is recommended that no construction
or future avoidance is necessary for these sites.
This report and any relevant records will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) or other accredited curation facility. No artifacts were collected during this project, so there will
be no need for artifact curation.

Environmental Background
The project area is located in western Tom Green County, not far from Irion County, and in the extreme
northern portion of Schleicher County. Tom Green County is considered to be representative of the
natural environment for the project area, so it is used as the primary source for the following discussion.
Physiography
Tom Green County is often described as being within west-central Texas, a loosely defined area that
typically includes the extreme southern portion of the Great Plains Province (Fenneman 1931) that
consists of the Edwards Plateau, the southern edge of which separates the Great Plains from the Coastal
Plains. To the west lies the Basin and Range Province and to the northeast the Central Lowland Province
(Leighty 2001). The Edwards Plateau is an uplifted region of Cretaceous-aged limestone and shale that is
relatively level to the west but deeply dissected to the east (TPWD 2010a). The northern portion of Tom
Green County lies within the Rolling Plains Ecological Region, described as a gently rolling landform
composed of soils that range from fine sands to clays (TPWD 2010b), and is also referred to as the Osage
Plains (Henderson 2010).
Geology
Permian through Quaternary-aged geologic formations are found within Tom Green County (Weidenfeld
and Flores 1976). The central-eastern portion of the county is dominated by Pleistocene and more recent
caliche and gravel deposits, while the more western portion of the county, that includes the project area,
consists largely of alternating bands of Segovia and Fort Terrett formations of the Edwards Group
(Barnes 1974). These are described as cherty limestone and dolomite over limestone, marl and shale.
Field observations confirm that the Segovia formation is responsible for extremely dense deposits of high
quality nodular and tabular chert. Elsewhere there are relatively small areas of Antlers Sand and Seymour
Formation limestone and chert pebbles, cobbles and boulders. Quaternary gravel deposits and recent
alluvium are found along some of the larger stream channels.
Hydrography
The Concho River is formed by the joining of the North, Middle and South Concho Rivers in the vicinity
of San Angelo, and is the primary drainage system for the region (Henderson 2010). The Concho River
joins the Colorado River a few miles to the east. The North Concho River is the principal water source
for Lake O. C. Fisher, while the Middle and South Concho, along with major creeks Spring and Dove,
feed Twin Buttes Reservoir. Burks Creek and Bois d’Arc Draw are two additional drainages crossed by
the transmission line route. Many other mapped drainages were found to often be very minor, consisting
of no more than low swales across the landscape, although a few were well entrenched into limestone
substrate.
Climate
Tom Green County is within the Edwards Plateau Division of the Interior Climatic Region (Carr 1969).
As such it has characteristics - rainfall, temperature means – similar to counties surrounding it. Through
1960 the mean annual temperature was 66 degrees Fahrenheit, and the mean annual precipitation was 20
inches (Orton 1969). There is an average growing season of 232 days (Wiedenfeld and Flores 1976) and
snowfall is common, although it rarely lingers. There is an average wind speed of 11 miles an hour which
helps offset relatively high humidity in what might otherwise be considered a semiarid climate.
Soils
Soils in Tom Green County are primarily mollisols, along with occasional alfisols, inceptisols, vertisols
and entisols (Weidenfeld and Flores 1976). The presence of mollisols is suggestive of the widespread
grassland savanna first seen by European settlers in the 1800s (TPWD 2010a). All five of the major soil
associations documented in Tom Green County are found within the project area. These are: Tarrant15

Ector association, “very shallow to shallow, undulating to hilly, calcareous soils on limestone hills;”
Kimbrough-Mereta-Angelo association, “Very shallow, shallow, and deep, nearly level to sloping and
undulating, calcareous soils on outwash plains;” Angelo association, “Deep, nearly level, calcareous soils
on outwash plains;” Rioconcho-Spur association, “Deep, nearly level calcareous soils on flood plains;”
and Olton-Cobb-Cosh association, “deep to shallow, nearly level to sloping, noncalcareous soils on
outwash plains or over sandstones” (Weidenfeld and Flores 1976:3).
Specific soils that overlap late Holocene alluvial terraces (Qal formation) are Angelo, Cho, Dev and
Rioconcho, Ector, Kavett, Mereta, Rioconcho and Spur, Tarrant, Tobosa and Tulia soils. These are all
mollisols except for Tulia loam, an alfisol, and Tobosa clay, a vertisol. Soils that are described as having
deep A and/or B horizons along alluvial terraces are Dev and Rioconcho, the Rioconcho and Spur, and
the Tobosa soils. The Dev, Rioconcho and Spur soils are within the Bottomland range type, and Tobosa
clay is in the Heavy Clay range type (Weidenfeld and Flores 1976:59). Approximately 2.8 miles of the
proposed transmission line corridor crosses these last three soils. Rioconcho and Spur soils account for
about 1.4 miles, primarily in broad valleys in the northern half of the project area, the Dev and Rioconcho
soils about 0.6 miles in narrow valleys in the southern half, interspersed with about 0.8 miles Tobosa
clays that tend to be more spread out.
Vegetation
Tom Green (and most of Schleicher) County is dominated by some combination of Mesquite and Juniper
Shrub and Brush with some Live Oak Brush in areas (McMahan et. al 1984), a distribution common for
the western Edwards Plateau. Shrub is described as scattered woody plants while brush is indicative of
denser groupings. Typical height is less than 9 feet. Corresponding with the geologic deposits east of
San Angelo mapped as Pleistocene caliche and gravel there is widespread agriculture. Within the project
area commonly associated plants include lotebush, shin oak, sumac, prickly pear, tassajillo, kidneywood,
agarito, yucca, Lindheimer silktassel, sotol, catclaw, Mexican persimmon, sideoats grama, three-awn,
Texas grama, hairy grama, curly mesquite, buffalograss and hairy tridens. The vegetation regime has
been substantially altered over the past 150 years through fire suppression allowing once dominant
grasslands (USACE 2005) to be replaced by brush (TPWD 2010a).
A common condition seen along much of the transmission line corridor was extensive clearing of brush,
resulting in moderate to extreme disturbance as evidenced by brush piles and upturned bedrock,
especially in shallow soils, and soil berms in deeper soils (Figure 12, Figure 13). Views from higher
vistas suggest that many 10s, if not 100s of
thousands of acres have been recently
cleared, probably mostly by trackhoes and
less so by bulldozers. One landowner
indicated that much of this clearing had
taken place in the early 2000s as part of a
government cost sharing program. The
emphasis was on removing cedar and
mesquite. This particular rancher indicated
that the program seemed to have been
successful in raising groundwater levels. It
was also clear that some landowners had
been more careful in their methods than
others, as seen by the level of ground
disturbance. The net result was an increase

combined with a substantial decrease in the
integrity of cultural remains.
16

Although some programs were administered
through the Natural Resources Conservation
Services (NRCS) department of the US
Department of Agriculture, administration of
the program was on a case by case basis (Ron
Crumley, NRCS, personal communication,
January 2011). Programming through the
Texas Soil and Water Conservation Board
identified the Twin Buttes watershed as one of
three large areas needing brush control
(UCRA 2000) and which encompasses the
entirety of the present study area.
The UCRA study noted that the present
“brush infestation” became established during
Figure 13. Typical fenceline clearing in Edwards Group

between the 1920s and 1960 showed a
dramatic change from grassland prairie to
brushland (UCRA 2000:7). Additionally, up to 25 percent of once-perennial streams had quit flowing
during the drought of the 1950s, and were unable to become reestablished due to water-sucking mesquite,
juniper and salt cedar, and that unless immediate brush control was undertaken that still-flowing streams
Dove Creek, Spring Creek, and the South Concho River might cease, threatening water supplies for the
entire San Angelo region (UCRA 2000:9). Proposed clearing methods included chemical treatment,
bulldozing, root plowing, and two-way chaining. (UCRA 2000:98). Given the observed brush clearing
visible from the project area, the program was quite successful.
Fauna
Referencing the oft-cited Blair (1950), the project area falls within the Balconian province, one of seven
described for the state. The Balconian province’s boundaries generally overlap those of the Edwards
Plateau, largely following the edge of the Balcones escarpment and encompassing as well the Lower
Pecos, Llano Uplift and Lampasas Cut Plains regions. Blair states that this is a large faunal ectotone
where there is “…an intermixture of faunal elements characteristic of other, major, provinces” resulting in
an “…aggregate fauna…quite unlike that of any other area…” (Blair 1950:112). There are (were) 57
known mammal species, 16 of lizards, 36 of snakes, 15 of amphibians (toads and frogs), and seven of
salamanders. There are also numerous bird species, including both residential and migratory species
(USACE 2005).
Geoarchaeology
Recent work by the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) has produced a useful geomorphic and
geoarcheological summary of the Twin Buttes Reservoir area (Nordt and Bousman 2001) which includes,
by extension, aspects of the project area. Using various profiles from the Middle and South Concho
Rivers, Spring Creek, and an unnamed tributary, as well as data from Blum and Valastro (1992) they
demonstrated as many as three episodes of alluvial deposition and terrace construction that could be
recognized during the Middle, Late, and Latest Pleistocene at elevations of 18-22 meters, 12-14 meters,
and 8-9 meters, respectively, above modern stream channels, with a widespread downcutting episode near
the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary. Early Holocene deposition began around 8000-7000 B.P and ending
about 3500 B.P. (Nordt and Bousman 2001:51). Late Holocene development started shortly thereafter
and continued to as recently as 1000-900 B.P. which forms the modern flood terrace. The modern
terraces were formed beginning about 900 to 800 years ago and often form an A soil horizon resting
directly on a C horizon. Streams appeared to have become increasingly well-established during the
17

passage from the early to Late Holocene periods. These and other findings produced a model suggesting
sites of all ages may be found both on surfaces that correspond with or predate occupations, or found
buried in depositional settings postdating occupations (Nordt and Bousman 2001:52).
Paleoenvironment
Nickels and Mauldin, (2001) succinctly summarize regional paleonvionmental studies to date, and apply
them to their (and therefore the present) study area, with the caveat that none of the referenced sources
apply directly to west central Texas. In very brief summary, (see Nickels and Mauldin 2001 for direct
references),the data indicate that between 17,000 and 15,500 BP a cool, dry grassland was present that
was gradually replaced by a cool, moist woodland environment. During the Early Holocene beginning
10,000 years ago, there was a gradual warming and drying trend, although the presence of tall grasses and
other woody plants suggest a climate that is still relatively moist. Beginning about 8,000 years ago there
was a decline in woody species with a trend towards increasing aridity seen in an expansion of grasslands,
with a period of perhaps extreme dryness occurring, dependent upon the data set, in some increments
between 7,500 and 2,500 years ago. Fluctuations in climate are present throughout, and the Late
Holocene period, beginning about 4000 BP is no exception. Once again, there are alternating periods of
warm and cool, wet and dry periods, with a notable presence of short grasses present around1000 BP,
coincident with bison presence at some archaeological sites. In short, however, the end of the Pleistocene
saw a general end towards warmer and drier conditions with some disagreement in the data as to when
specific fluctuations occurred. In many respects, it is the result of these fluctuations on the human
resource base, in particular the relative presence of absence of bison, that is most relevant. Nickels and
Mauldin (2001:37) conclude that, at least the in few past thousands of years, there has been little in the
way of dramatic change in climate, and therefore, one would assume, in the active resource base.
Somewhat ironically, but not unexpectedly, it is only with the past 150 years or so that the west central
Texas biotic regime has seen any difference in structure. Prehistorically, Nickels and Mauldin suggest the
period between 6,000 and 8,000 years ago would be expected as having the least intensive amount of
settlement, due to a fairly well identified period of aridity (Nickels and Mauldin 20001:38).

Cultural Background
Prehistoric
The project area falls squarely within the Central Texas archaeological region as defined by Prewitt
(1981) and criticized by others (e.g. Ellis et. al 1995). Some (e.g., Creel 1977, 1978, Boyd, 1995) choose
to view west-central Texas as a distinctive archaeological zone or subregion. As such, it has many
cultural characteristics in common with a regional or even extra-regional perspective, while others aspects
may be more localized or even unique.
Archaeologists and cultural historians have been dividing and redividing, and at times recombining, the
12,000 to 18,000 year period of time that is generally recognized as that during which humans were
present on the Texas, (and North American) landscape. At present, probably the most widely-used
chronology for central Texas stems from Collins (1995), augmented and slightly revised in 2004 (Collins
2004) (Table 1).
This chronology consists of Paleoindian (which includes “pre-Clovis”), Early Middle and Late Archaic
(and sometimes Transitional Archaic), Late Prehistoric I and II, and Historic, or post-contact periods.
Each of these time periods have characteristics that enable some aspect of the human condition to
illustrate changes from periods before or after. These are often based on a technological and/or social
response to the changing natural environment and the pressure placed upon it by its human inhabitants.
Detailed descriptions of these periods are easily available to any interested reader, so the basic
characteristics of each, as commonly described, are only briefly summarized in this report.

The Paleoindian period is typically considered a time of big game hunters (e.g. Clovis) who pursued nowextinct forms of prey widely across the North American continent during the end of the last ice age. More
recent research indicates these people had a much more diverse subsistence base than previously thought,
were probably more settled, and had the social and mental complexity necessary to construct and maintain
abstract representative systems. These people had also perfected the art of stone tool production, creating
implements that were never again matched in North America with the same level of required
manufacturing skill.
At the end of the Ice Age, about 10,000 years ago, a warming climate forced a change in adaptive
strategies as the megafauna of the Pleistocene disappeared and people were forced to rely on smallersized prey. This long-lived Archaic period (ca. 10,000 to 1,200 years ago) is divided into three
subperiods (Early, Middle, Late) that are recognized by distinctive tool types (typically projectile points)
that indicate technological change and perhaps social identity. There are other technological adaptations
such as the level of food processing, typically seen through the creative use of heated rocks and levels of
and types of gathered - as opposed to hunted - resources. Fluctuations in interpersonal violence are
suggestive of a varying resource structure and the human demands placed upon it.
The Late Prehistoric Period begins about 1,000 years ago with the introduction of the bow and arrow, a
more efficient weapon delivery system than the larger shaft-mounted spearheads (darts) used previously.
Increased hunting efficiency led generally to larger populations, continuing the cycle of resource stress. It
has been argued (see Collins 1995) that an Archaic lifeway (generalized hunting and gathering) persisted
through the first half of this Late Prehistoric period, until about 700 years ago, when bison, which had
been present intermittently, reappeared, and with them a renewed emphasis on nomadic hunting of big
game, and perhaps the arrival of a new set of people (Toyah) on the Texas landscape. Most researchers,
however, continue to signify the beginning of the Late Prehistoric Period with the introduction of the bow
and arrow. About 700 years ago, ceramics were also introduced; another technological advance that
allowed the more efficient and thorough processing of foodstuffs, especially grains and seeds. This was
especially important for the youngest components of the human population, and certainly encouraged
reproductive success.
The Historic, or contact period, also sometimes referred to as “protohistoric,” begins with the early
Spanish entradas, followed by the missions and accompanying presidios. The effort to Christianize the
native populations, coupled with sweeping diseases, quickly resulted in the extirpation of indigenous
groups, with those voids filled by newcomers from the Plains who had expertly adopted a highly mobile,

19

horse-based raiding style. These are the Apache and Comanche, among others, which fill the normative,
idealized view of the American Indian.
As mentioned above, there are aspects of this general chronology that are common across the broader
region. Some components of the descriptions may be more regionally specific. For example, an
alternative to the Toyah horizon may be a Toyah homeland located generally in the project area (Arnn
2007). Arnn convincingly argues that the traditional view of a Toyah incursion is not supported when
looking at the entirety of a “true” Toyah assemblage, which appears to have its origins squarely within
center of the Edwards Plateau, and much as with Clovis, has produced evidence that Toyah people were
as opportunistic and broad spectrum-based as their predecessors, especially in regards to the consumption
of deer, small game and freshwater mussels. Arnn also notes that the Concho River region has been
identified by some as the homeland of the Jumano people (e.g. Hickerson 1994).
Another cultural construct that has been placed in Tom Green and surrounding counties is the Blow Out
Mountain Phase during the first part of the Late Prehistoric period, corresponding generally with what is
referred to as the Austin Phase in other portions of Central Texas. First described by Creel (1990), the
phase is described as the latter part of the earlier-defined Brazos Culture (see previous investigations
section) described by E. B. Sayles. The Blow Out Mountain Phase is defined by arrowpoints similar to
Bonham or Alba styles and an arrowpoint that has the morphology of a Darl point but is smaller overall.
Creel also places points similar to Cliffton within this phase, as well as side-notched points similar to
Washita. The most definitive aspect of the phase is an apparent standardized mortuary custom where
remains are placed on relatively high overlooks, often in a pit that was sometimes lined with slabs, then
covered with a rock cairn. Burials were typically flexed and laid sideways, and ritualistic comingling of
different individuals was not uncommon. Secondary bundle burials and cremations also occurred. The
Blow Out Mountain Phase clearly needs more definition before it can be widely accepted as a valid
construct (Quigg and Peck 1995:15).
Finally, it is worth noting that published reports consistently note a preponderance of point styles
consistent with those commonly recognized for central Texas, with a secondary frequency of points from
the Lower Pecos area, and a lesser amount from the upper Texas plains or Panhandle region. This
suggests a general technological and perhaps cultural affinity dominated by central Texas but influenced
to varying degrees by groups to the southwest and the north. A “null hypothesis” is that the area in
question is typical of the central Texas cultural spectrum.
European Settlement
The area including Tom Green and northern Schleicher counties was perhaps first visited by the Spanish
in 1629 and in 1632 when Father Juan de Salas began working with the Jumano Indians along the Concho
River (Henderson 2010). Other Spanish excursions occurred in 1650, 1654, and 1684, and the region
became known for an abundance of pecans, pearl-bearing mussels (hence “Concho”) and numerous bison,
as well as the fairly friendly nature of the inhabitants. Within one hundred years, however, the Apache
arrived, followed by the Comanche in the early 1800s. The Comanche remained in firm control of the
region until the latter part of the nineteenth century.
It was not until 1852 that forts were constructed in the general area, and these were abandoned with the
outbreak of the Civil War. As the war drew to a close there was an increase in settlement, with Ben
Ficklin opening a stage station that became known as the town of Benficklin (Green 2010), and was the
original county seat until a flood destroyed the town in 1882 (Troesser 2010). R. F. Tankersley settled in
1864, and for a while there was a thriving community including a school at what is now the intersection
of Hwys 2335 and 67. All that remains now is the original Tankersley Ranch headquarters (Joe Collins,
personal communication 2010).

20

Between the continued hunting of bison by local settlers and an ill-advised attack on peaceful Kickapoo
Indians at Dove Creek in 1865, relations between the settlers and Natives quickly disintegrated. What
became Fort Concho, now in the city of San Angelo, was established in 1867. In 1868 the land that
would hold San Angelo (but was originally called Over the River and then Santa Angela) became settled
with a saloon and gambling houses. By 1870, three were about 1,000 people living in the region, almost
all at Fort Concho. It was not until the 1880s that the Tom Green County region (named for Confederate
General Thomas Green) began to see traditional settlement in the form of post offices, schools, churches
and stores, and a courthouse in 1884. In addition to post offices at Benficklin, Fort Concho and San
Angelo, there was one at Knickerbocker, which is located a few short miles south of Tankersley.
Knickerbocker, which still has a post office located in the old school building, was named for the
fictitious narrator of a Washington Irving satire because of his relationship to two early settlers (Troesser
2010).
The Goodnight-Loving Trail passed through Fort Concho and the cattle industry became an economic
mainstay, with sheep following close behind. The open range did not start to become fully fenced until
1885, and in 1886 the largest cattle round up in West Texas history occurred near Knickerbocker. The
arrival of the railroad to San Angelo in 1888 made it a center for shipment of cattle and wool. In 1890 the
local population was about 5,000 persons, increasing to almost 7,000 by 1900. By the 1920s San Angelo
was the largest primary wool market in the United States. Oil was discovered in 1940, the same time that
what is now Goodfellow Field Air Force base opened. Irrigation allowed farming to take place as well,
with a major increase in farms occurring between 1900 and 1910. Cotton became and remains a major
economic pursuit.
In summary, historic settlement of the region was not widespread until after the 1880s, and not common
until the turn of the century. Most historic resources, especially in rural areas, would be farm or
ranchsteads or activity areas dating to that period or later.
Previous Archaeological Investigations
Early work the San Angelo area was conducted by E. B Sayles who recorded a number of sites in nearby
Irion County, as well as, at minimum, two sites in Tom Green County (41TG233 and 41TG234). This
work, conducted in the early 1930s, was probably included in Sayles’ 1935 publication An
Archaeological Survey of Texas. Sayles attempted, without much in the way of chronological control, to
define culture areas across Texas, and placed the present project area within the “Early Food-Gathering”
Brazos River group and the later Food-Gathering and Early Agricultural Edwards Plateau/Brazos
group(s). Diagnostic artifacts included Darl, Frio, Ensor and Fairland points, along with a large arrow
point resembling a Bonham or Alba, these last presumably found in the more eastern portions of the
Brazos River culture area. Sayles also recognized the common occurrence of burned rock middens and
circular mortar holes, along with the presence of burials both in mounds (burned rock middens) and
shelters.
Robert Stephenson, while not referencing specific work in the study area, undoubtedly pulled on
investigations by J. Charles Kelley and the River Basins Surveys in the San Angelo area when developing
his short culture chronology for Texas (Stephenson 1950). The present project area falls within a very
large Central Texas Region that included all of the Edwards Plateau, the Lampasas Cut Plains, the Rio
Grande and Coastal Plains and a good portion of the southern Great Plains. Stephenson emphasized the
Balcones Phase, or “early food gathering horizon” for this area, which was represented by the Edwards
Plateau Aspect subdivided into the Clear Fork, Round Rock and Uvalde foci, all of which had large open
camps, burned rock middens, and rock shelters with nomadic gathering supplemented by hunting and
fishing. Periods equivalent to the Late Prehistoric period recognized the use of the bow and arrow as well
21

as ceramics and minimal agriculture for the more settled Nueces, Austin and Toyah foci. Although taken
to task by Alex Krieger (Kelley 1951), Stephenson’s work was a useful addition to the then very poorly
known prehistory of Texas (Kelley 1951:139).
Surveys preceding development of local reservoirs produced the recording of small numbers of sites (see
Mauldin and Nickels 2001:62, Jones et. al 2007:9), resulting ultimately in perhaps the earliest site
excavation in the area at 41TG109 (Green 1959). The site, a burned rock midden/campsite, was located
on Spring Creek about 5 miles downstream (east) from the project area. The testing project consisted of
hand excavating a trench across the midden to determine if there was evidence of stratigraphic zones.
The midden was thin and had mixed deposits and produced Uvalde, Bulverde, Pedernales and Langtry
points, among others. Uvalde points were at that time undated (or poorly dated [Suhm and Jelks
1962:255]), and Green suggested, probably correctly, that the site dated to the later part of the Archaic
stage (Uvalde Focus of the Edwards Plateau Aspect of the Balcones Phase, if following Stephenson).
Green noted that Langtry points linked the site to the Lower Pecos area, that mussel shell was common
while animal bone was not, and also remarked on the almost complete absence of ground stone, either
manos or metates.
Darrell Creel, in the late 1970s, completed the first regional synthesis of the Concho Valley, using a data
set of 49 sites within an area of 20 square kilometers (Creel 1977, 1978). He divided his study area into
three microenvironmental zones; hills (uplands), flats, and riparian areas, and compared site types and
frequencies across all settings, while taking into account the ecological history of the region. The riparian
zone was, of course, along stream channels; the flats were associated with Angelo series soils on “nearly
level outwash plains” (Creel 1978:259); and the uplands were described as rolling hills with very rocky
surfaces, notable for what Creel described as a continuous outcropping of chert that appears in both ledge
(tabular) and nodular forms, often present as eroded deposits. Large camps were found in the riparian
zones, and included burned rock middens. The flats had only four of the 49 sites, leading Creel to suggest
that human activity was limited in this environment as well. Uplands contained the expected lithic
procurement sites, but also held burned rock middens and mortar holes when in close proximity to water
resources. Observed projectile points were mostly those found commonly in central Texas but also
included Washita arrow points and Conejo and Val Verde dart points, indicating contact of some sort with
the Panhandle/Plains and the Lower Pecos regions. One Plainview point and one Angostura point were
observed: the remainder was all Late Archaic or Late Prehistoric in age, with Perdiz predominant in the
identifiable arrow point class. Only one site contained observed ceramics, and only two manos were
observed. Mortar hole sites were encountered as single features and in groups of up to six, but were not
seen frequently. Other than debitage, unifaces were the most common artifact class in all sites in all
settings. While mussel shell was noted at some sites, it does not appear to have been present in
remarkable quantities. At 41TG40, analyzed faunal remains were primarily of rabbit and prairie dog
among other small to medium-bodied mammals and limited numbers of larger mammals.
Shortly after Creel’s work Richard Hurt conducted as similar study in the area (Hurt 1980). Hurt
recorded 48 archaeological sites and used comparative data to postulate occupational frequency through
time and in different settings. (Hurt’s sites are not available on the Archeological Sites Atlas, but his
thesis is available through the Texas Tech online library.) He divided his study area into the lower prairie
(essentially the alluvial terrace of the Middle Concho River), the upper prairie (between the alluvial
terraces and the uplands), and butte (upland) settings, with further subdivisions in each. All sites were
considered camps, including lithic procurement sites, some of which had burned rock. No burned rock
middens were recorded. Of the 48 sites the majority were lithic scatters with burned rock (n=22). Few
sites were recorded in the upper prairie, and butte settings were dominated by lithic procurement sites.
Hurt identified slab-lined fire pits, hearths, burned rock scatters, one site with three mortars in sandstone,
one petroglyph on a boulder and one faded pictograph in a small rockshelter. Frio points were the most
common projectile point seen. Early points included Plainview, Uvalde, and Nolan. The rest were
22

dominated by Late Archaic types, mostly representative of typical Central Texas styles, but also including
Almagre, Langtry, Shumla and Pandale. Only one was mano was reported.
The results of a survey of the Twin Buttes Reservoir was published by the Center for Archaeological
Research (CAR) in 20001 (Mauldin and Nickels 2001), and includes site clusters 3 and 4, described
below in this report. The purpose of the survey was to provide management guidance to the Bureau of
Reclamation as they undertook a dam repair project requiring the use of borrow areas within federal
lands. CAR broadly classified site types as campsites, lithic scatters (which included procurement zones)
and lithic scatters with burned rock. Only one burned rock midden was reported, and a shell midden was
also present. Hearths were numerous, and a total of 68 mortar holes were recorded at eight different sites.
Projectile point styles were predominated by Late Archaic types, although there was a relatively strong
presence of Early Archaic styles compared with Creel’s study area to the south. Ground stone, once
again, is uncommon. Additionally, one site had sixteen ceramic sherds consistent with description for
Leon Plain pottery. Historic sites within the project area dated as early as 1880 (one to 1870) but were
predominated by sites dating to the 1920s and later. Farmsteads were the most common site type, but
farming and ranching operations, irrigation features, and a gravel quarry as well as a schoolhouse, isolated
structures, a dugout and trash dumps were also present.
A survey of O.C. Fisher Lake was published in 2007 (Jones et. al 2007), and includes sites described in
clusters 6 and 7 (below) in this report. Of the total 29 archaeological sites recorded, apparently none had
diagnostic prehistoric artifacts. Site types were not defined or tabulated, but campsites, quarries and lithic
scatters were all represented. Of the 23 prehistoric sites recorded seven were felt to have undetermined
research potential requiring avoidance or further testing. The six historic period sites dated no earlier than
1890. Only one was considered to National Register potential, a dugout dated to 1890.
A number of other relatively small-scale survey projects have been undertaken in the area, and can be
interpreted by way of the site cluster discussion elsewhere in this report. There are three survey projects,
however, that intersect the project area that will be briefly discussed. In 2003 PBS&J surveyed what is
now the existing Twin Buttes substation and access road along with 9 miles of transmission line (Nash
and Henley 2003). Approximately 7 miles of this line, known as T-429, runs parallel with the newly
proposed line, with ROW edges meeting on the east edge of the new line’s easement. One site, 41TG577
was recorded as a thin lithic scatter requiring no further work. Because this site had not been digitized on
the Sites Atlas it was revisited and given a field designation of TB005. There was no change in
recommendations.
In 2002 a 150-acre tract of land was proposed for substation along with a short (ca. 2 mile) transmission
line that would have tied into another transmission line to the east (none were ever constructed). The
linear portion of this project crossed the presently proposed ROW about 1.6 miles north of Hwy 853.
This is at or near the location of site 41TG577, mentioned above, and also corresponds nearly with the
mapped location of 41TG573, recorded in 2002 (West 2002). Site 41TG574 was also recorded a short
distance east of the present project area. Both these sites were described as small surface lithic scatter
consistent with early stage chert reduction, and neither site was recommended for further work or
avoidance.
Further south, the All American Pipeline project, a massive survey undertaking, recorded site 41TG278 a
bit south of newly recorded site 41TG640. It was described as a lithic procurement area that was “located
on a hill, through a valley and up a hill to another valley.” The present project crosses the western portion
of this site, where a light scatter of lithic material was observed. Given the nature of the site and its
deposits, it was not formally reinvestigated.

23

There are a number of sites that have been excavated in the area. Site 41TG91 was excavated by TxDOT
in 1978 (Creel 1990). The site was notable for an apparent bison kill, substantial freshwater mussel
exploitation, and a large ceramic assemblage. Some human remains, including cranial fragments, were
also recovered. Creel focused on the later, more fully examined Blow Out Mountain and Toyah phase
zones, the latter of which had the most amount of material.
Site 41TG307 and 41TG309 were excavated in 1993 in response to a sewer pipeline project (Quigg et. al
1996). The excavations at both sites focused on Early Archaic occupations where freshwater mussel
procurement was an important activity, although other foraging activities were inferred from stone tool
analyses.
Site 41TG346, the Rush Site, contained the remains of over 50 bison associated with at least three distinct
arrowpoint types (Quigg and Peck 1995). It was suggested that this locale served as a communal
gathering spot for various cultural groups during seasonal (fall) abundance of bison during Toyah times.
At 41TG352, a non-point source pollution abatement project resulted in the discovery of a deeply buried
multi-period site dating to the past 2,000 years (McCulloch et. al 2000). Thirty-three features, consisting
primarily of burned rock and mussel shell, were identified within 15 separate occupation zones at depths
exceeding 2 meters. As with other sites in the area, mussel shell exploitation appeared to be a primary
economic pursuit.
Deserving separate mention is site 41IR94, the location of the Battle of Dove Creek Battle, also known as
the Dove Creek Massacre, which occurred on Dove Creek about 4 miles west of the project area. This
controversial event was a poorly executed attack by overeager Confederate and State Militia against thenpeaceful Kickapoo Indians who were moving towards Mexico during January of 1865 (Kelton 2010).
Although final casualty counts are unclear, it is apparent that the Anglo forces were overwhelmingly
defeated, and were therefore the “massacred,” rather than the Kickapoo.
Site Clusters
Using data from the digital Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas database from the Texas Historical
Commission, 18 distinct clusters of archaeological sites, ranging in numbers from around a dozen to close
to 200, were reviewed at a high level in order to more fully define the archaeological record of the region.
These clusters are shown in Figure 14 and discussed in this section.
Cluster 1 consists of 52 sites, almost all of which were recorded by Darrell Creel and reported upon in his
Master’s Thesis and a subsequent article in the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society (Creel 1977,
1978). Creel recorded camp sites, burned rock middens, mortar hole sites, a shelter with pictographs,
lithic scatters and lithic procurement sites within a 20 square km (5,000 acre) area which included the
South Concho River valley and nearby uplands. The study area was centered about 5 miles east of the
proposed transmission line. Creel identified three microenvironmental zones within his study area:
riparian, flatlands, and uplands. Riparian zones, not surprisingly, had the greatest array and diversity of
archaeological sites. The flatlands were largely devoid of prehistoric cultural material, typically limited
to small rises where remnant chert deposits resulted in ephemeral lithic or procurement scatters. Upland
settings likewise were more limited in types and numbers of sites, although chert occurs in bands in these
settings. When an upland setting was in close proximity (overlooking) a water source, campsites with
burned rock middens and upland mortar holes were possible. Included in this set of sites is 41TG214,
recorded in 1924, probably by E. B. Sayles, as an apparent cairn burial with grinding slabs. It was located
on the edge of a high hill overlooking the South Concho River.

24

Cluster 2 consists of 16 sites centered about 3 miles north of Cluster 1. These are all located in the
vicinity of Christoval along the South Concho River and in the uplands to the east. The majority of these
were recorded by the Concho Valley Archeological Society (CVAS). Sites included several with burned
rock middens, including midden complexes and upland middens located near small drainages. At least
one midden site contained Perdiz arrowpoints. A mortar hole site was present on the South Concho
River, and a rock cairn, possibly a burial, was perched on the southwest-facing edge of a high hill
overlooking the river. Additionally, three campsites recorded by TxDOT, 41TG114-116 that were
recommended for testing, were subsequently found to lack integrity of deposits necessary for National
Register eligibility (Young 1980).
Clusters 3 and 4 consist of over 200 sites, most of which are captured in the Twin Buttes Reservoir survey
(Mauldin and Nickels 2001), and range in distance from 1 to 8 miles east of the project area. The Twin
Buttes study consisted of survey of high probability areas of over 10,000 acres within the reservoir
floodplain, which includes the combined Dove and Spring creek drainages, the Middle Concho River, and
other smaller drainage systems. A total of 199 archaeological sites were recorded, 178 of which were
new. Prehistoric sites ranged in age from Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric. There were 19 historic
components, mostly associated with farming and ranching activities. The earliest was a dugout dated to
1860, and the earliest permanent dwelling dated to 1870, with most sites dating to the 1900s. It was
surmised that before 1900 there was only one family living in the study area, although a school was
present by around 1900 (Mauldin and Nickels 2001:203). Thirteen of 19 historic components were felt to
have moderate to high research potential, and 81 prehistoric components were felt to have moderate to
high research potential. About 30 of these sites, recorded by Darrell Creel, are located southwest of the
Twin Buttes study area on the South Concho River and included numerous camps but also a high number
of lithic quarries. Site 41TG124 was notable for buried deposits with apparent bison bone included in the
matrix.
Cluster 5 is a line of sites along the Concho River within and east of San Angelo. This includes Fort
Concho (41TG57) which is a National Register property, district, and State Archeological Landmark.
Also present are SAL site 41TG307 and 41TG309, both of which had deeply buried and relatively
discrete Early Archaic occupation zones. These sites were partially mitigated in 1993, and portions of
each remain undisturbed within San Angelo (Quigg et. al 1996). There are numerous other campsites
present, at least one with mortar holes, and a number of which are at least potentially eligible for SAL
status, based on descriptions in the site forms. An example is 41TG352, a deeply buried campsite with
Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric occupations containing multiple features in as much as 3 meters of
deposits in Rioconcho series soils, as described on the site form. Later work here consisted of emergency
testing and excavation along with trench monitoring in response to a public works project (McCulloch et.
al 2000). Other sites include relatively recent limekiln and trash deposits associated with Fort Concho.
Clusters 6 and 7 consist of 54 sites in the Lake O. C. Fisher area. These sites are on the North Concho
River, Pot Creek, Red Arroyo and various unnamed tributaries and nearby settings. They were recorded
by CVAS members, Darrel Creel, and as a result of compliance projects. The most recent work was
conducted in the 2,455-acre lake basin as part of a vegetation restoration project on the USACE property
(Jones et. al 2007). Prehistoric sites included site 41TG12, recorded during the river basin surveys by E.
B. Sayles. Minimal information indicates a human burial as well as several hearths. A mammoth tooth
was noted in the river channel at the site. There were several campsites with features buried to depths of
50, 60 and 100 cm. Included in this set was 41TG346, the Rush Site, which had almost 2 meters of
deposits representing five distinct Toyah occupations, including a bison processing event dating to 375
B.P. (Quigg and Peck 1995). There were at least two petroglyphs sites recorded (41TG54 and 41TG201)
and at least one burned rock midden. Historic sites included a late nineteenth century farmstead, a series
of stone walls thought to be range rider shelters, and what was reported to be early headquarters of the
local Pulliam Ranch.

26

Clusters 8 and 10 consist of 16 sites in Irion County and 15 sites in Tom Green County that were recorded
as part of a master’s thesis project (Hurt 1980). The Irion County sites were along Dry Creek, a tributary
of the Middle Concho and dissected uplands to the north, and are centered some 15 miles west of the
project area. The Tom Green County sites are only about 3 miles west of the project area, and are along
the Middle Concho, in what Hurt referred to as the Lower Prairie, probably similar to Creel’s (1978)
Flatlands, and upland/buttes settings to the south. Sixty percent of the Tom Green County sites had “fire
hearths,” while only 43 percent of Irion County sites did. No burned rock middens were recorded, nor
were any burial sites. Three of the four Lower Prairie sites were lithic scatters without burned rock and
the fourth was a lithic quarry. Upland and butte sites were designated as lithic scatters and lithic quarries,
several with burned rock, some including fire hearths. There was one rock shelter and two rock art sites,
one a petroglyph on a boulder and the other a faded red monochrome pictograph in a rock shelter. There
were not great numbers of mortars seen. It is worth noting that Hurt did not define camps as a separate
site type – all his sites were considered short term encampments. Projectile points recorded by Hurt were
primarily Late Archaic in age, ranging from Pedernales through Darl. One Plainview was found at
41TG151, as was a Williams point. There were six Nolan points recovered at 41IR25, perhaps the only
site without a clear Late Archaic association. No arrow points are reported. Point styles reflected a mix
of typical central Texas and Lower Pecos types.
Cluster 9 is a loose association of 12 sites located about nine miles west o f the project area on Dry Rocky
Creek, West Rocky Creek, and along the Middle Concho River. Sites 41IR5-IR10 were included in
Hurt’s study (referenced above) and included lithic scatters with burned rock, some with hearths. Other
sites were recorded by CVAS and consisted of a series of open camps, one (41TG123) with a shell
midden, along with an apparent stop for the Butterfield Stage known as Johnson’s Stage that was also a
military outpost.
Cluster 11consists of seven sites along and near Spring Creek, about three miles west of the project area.
Sites 41IR54-411IR58 were recorded by E. B. Sayles in the early 1930s, and very little information is
available for them. Site 41IR55 and 41IR56 were on a pair of buttes south of the creek, although the
forms give little hint as to what types of sites they are, and actually suggest they may be either misplotted
or misidentified. Burials and/or ceramics may have been present at some, but the single page site forms
are not necessarily clear. Also included in the Sayles group is 41TG233, revisited by CVAS, and
described as an open camp with bedrock mortars, both within Spring Creek and in adjacent uplands. Site
41IR116 is an open camp that was tested and possibly further excavated by CVAS and reportedly has
Early, Middle and Late Archaic components.
Custer 12 is six sites along and near the South Concho River near Hwy 277, less than two miles south of
the southern portion of the project area. These were recorded as part of an Air Force related radar
installation. Site 41SL10, 18 and 19 were on a high ridge overlooking the river. Two of these were
possible campsites and one was a lithic scatter. The recorders felt they may actually all tie together but
access issues prevented them from demonstrating this. Site 41SL12, in addition to being a (largely
destroyed) burned rock midden site, was also the probable location of an old school house.
Cluster 13 consists of six sites that are a relatively impressive array of campsites, some with burned rock
middens (at 41SL28 up to 1.5 m thick) and a hilltop cairn thought to perhaps hold a burial. These sites
are along a set of minor drainages of the South Concho River about four miles south of Cluster 12. These
sites were all recorded recently by members of CVAS.
Cluster 14 is immediately west of the project area on either side of the Middle Concho River. Recorded
by John Hurt (see Clusters 8 and 10, above), it consists of sites 41TG150-154. These sites were
categorized as lithic scatters with burned rock, except for 41TG154, described as a very small rockshelter
with a faded red pictograph. This site was driven past during the present survey, (but not revisited) and
27

was seen to occupy a curious limestone outcrop between the edge of a plowed field and open pasture,
similar in some respects to the formation along Dove Creek containing 41TG646 (this report).
Cluster 15 is about one mile east of the project area along moderate-sized streams feeding O. C. Fisher
Lake. There are seven sites that are primarily lithic scatters, although one contains a burned rock midden
or possibly a hearth (41TG544) and two have disarticulated hearths. Only 41TG544 was recommended
for testing or avoidance although a later resist revised that assessment and indicated the site had little
additional research value.
Cluster 16 is located very near the transmission line project area on either side of, but primarily east of
Dove Creek. The sites include the original location of Knickerbocker and a nearby house site dating to
the late 1800s. Recorded primarily by CVAS, other notable sites included 41TG569, a Late Prehistoric
sites with beads, ceramics and various tools, 41TG570, a buried camp with nearby mortars, and 41TG177,
which had numerous hearths. Site 41TG623 was the most recently recorded site, possibly in anticipation
of the present project. It had numerous surface hearths within a large field and possible buried
components. The present project comes within 250 meters of the mapped boundary of this site. Sites
41TG632, 41TG633, 41TG642 (a large burned rock midden), 41TG645, 41TG646, 41TG647 and
41TG648 were all recorded along the nearby portion of the presently routed transmission line (this
report).
Cluster 17 is a 20-site sample of a 14 mile-long section of the All American Pipeline project survey. The
easternmost portion of this sample is about 6.5 miles west of the present project area. A number of lithic
scatters and lithic procurement sites were documented, as well as camps and a burned rock midden. Site
41IR87 was a deflated burned rock midden. Site 41IR70 was an upland camp that had suffered typical
deflation. Site 41IR66, located on the slopes and top of Monument Hill, was a camp with shelters, a
cairn, and pictographs. Comments were made regarding the high quality nature of the chert available at
the procurement sites, and that the quarry sites often had evidence of camping activities.
Cluster 18 is within a widespread zone east of the project area that was surveyed by Darrel Creel in the
late 1970s. The 11 sites here were lithic procurement and lithic scatter sites, a camp site and four burned
rock middens. One of the lithic procurement sites (41TG179) had a 6 m diameter boulder ring with a
depression in the center. Burned rock midden site 41TG134 contained slab-lined pits, a cairn (possibly
recent) and a mortar hole. Both 41TG132 and 41TG172 were upland burned rock middens. Site
41TG127 was a rich terrace site with organic material and a burned rock midden on a ridge above a
spring. These sites bring to mind aspects of the Blow Out Mountain Phase sites described later by Creel
(1990) and others (e.g. Boyd 1995, 2004).
Summary – Site Clusters
Examining these clusters of sites provides a set of expectations for the present project. Lithic
procurement and lithic scatters are common. Camp sites are found not only along stream channels, as
expected, but also in more upland settings, as, potentially, are burned rock middens and mortar hole sites.
Rockshelters are present but not especially common. Pictographs and petroglyphs have been recorded,
but apparently on a fairly small scale. Hilltop cairns are present in the area, and may represent prehistoric
burials. Rural historic sites, whether simple trash scatters or occupation sites, are rare.

Research Design and Methods
The archaeological survey and subsequent analysis and reporting followed procedures and standards set
forth by the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), and the
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). The goals of the survey were to:
28

Indentify all cultural resource sites that are potentially eligible for formal listing as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and/or are potentially eligible for the National Register
of
Historic Places (NRHP) and that may be impacted by construction and/or future maintenance of
the transmission line;
Evaluate such sites as to their potential eligibility for formal listing as SALs and/or
nomination as National Register (NR) sites;
Provide supporting information to the THC that will allow it to comment on LCRA’s
findings;
Develop avoidance measures that allow LCRA TSC to minimize impacts to potential SAL and
NRHP-eligible archaeological sites;
If avoidance is impossible, draft potential testing and/or mitigation measures to be covered under
a separate Antiquities Permit.

The cultural resources survey focused on high probability areas (HPAs) as identified by a review of
topographic, geologic, and historic maps along with soils and other pertinent data. Factors used to define
HPAs included distance from permanent or intermittent waters sources, types of soils and their potentials
for containing buried cultural materials, locations and types of previously recorded sites within the
broader physiographic and cultural region, and locations of structures depicted on modern and
georeferenced historical maps. HPAs were adjusted in the field to account for consistent negative
findings or, potentially, when potential SAL or NRHP-eligible sites are found in unexpected settings (the
latter did not occur).
Approximately 13.25 miles (225 acres) of this line were originally identified as having a high to moderate
probability of containing SAL-eligible archaeological sites. Additionally, seven potential historic
structures were identified on available maps (1891, 1924 and 1957) within 500 feet of the proposed
centerline. The modern topographic maps shows 10 structures within 500 feet of the centerline, but some
of these are probably coincident with those shown on earlier maps. The line will run about 3/4 of a mile
west of the community of Knickerbocker, which was settled around 1875, and essentially through the
community of Tankersley, which did not have a post office until 1910, according to the Handbook of
Texas Online. The line runs past the Midway Cemetery about 5.5 miles south of the Twin Buttes
substation. This cemetery has graves dating to 1909 and was designated a Historic Texas Cemetery in
December of 2009. The battle of Dove Creek took place about 6 miles southwest of the where the line
crosses Dove Creek. At no point is the line
closer than 4 miles to the battlefield site. Fort
Concho was in the southern section of San
Angelo, well to the east of the project area.
High probability areas and cultural resource
sites were assessed by teams of archaeologists
following minimum survey standards. Survey
transects were at 30 m intervals at most (Figure
15). Shovel tests were planned to conform to
minimum standards of 16 tests per mile of high
probability area.
Where shallow, nonaggrading soils, sparse vegetation, exposed
bedrock and a high degree of erosion or other
disturbances were observed, it was determined
that a lesser number was sufficient.
Conversely, at Dove Creek, where the line
crosses substantial Holocene-aged alluvial

deposits, and following a field assessment,
machine-dug trenches were excavated. Shovel
tests were excavated 30-50 cm on a side and in
20 cm increments, with all matrix passed
through 1/4 inch mesh or hand sorted when
screening was impossible. They were excavated
to a depth of 80-100 cm or to bedrock or its
equivalent in settings where there was potential
for deeply buried cultural deposits. Soils within
the project area were often extremely dense and
dry. As a result they were usually excavated by
rotating crew members using a broad-headed
spade, a sharpshooter, and a rock bar, with the
rock bar often being the only method of
penetrating the soil (Figure 16). Backhoe

meters. Profiles were drawn of representative
soils.
trenches. In some cases, where there were broad
expanses of dense, deep soils, a machine-mounted auger was used in lieu of hand operated shovels
(particularly, Dove and Spring creeks) (Figure 17).
Cultural resource sites were shovel tested according to the amount of visibility, depth of soils, and size of
site. Sites were mostly restricted to recording within the established ROW, although in some cases a
wider area of potential effect was obviously required, and in other cases travelling to the site clearly
expanded its boundaries. Shovel tests, features and site centroids were recorded by a handheld GPS,
which typically has a 2-3 meter error range. Sketch maps were drawn in the field to aid with quality
control. Sites and representative survey areas were photo-documented. All sites were recorded on the
TexSite database and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for assignment
of permanent trinomials. Because the ROW will be within easements on privately owned land, a no
collection policy was established and maintained. Project notes, records, photographs and other data may
be curated if deemed useful and appropriate.
Historic sites were researched at a level
commensurate with their research potential.
Twentieth century trash scatters not associated
with house locations or other use areas were
planned to be documented (there were none),
but not necessarily assigned trinomials. Isolated
nineteenth century trash scatters were to be
recorded as archaeological sites, but not
necessarily researched further (there were none).
Artifact scatters associated with structural
remains or mapped historic structures were
researched further, first through discussion with
present landowners or others who may be aware
of past residents and use, and secondly through
courthouse and deed record searches.

Results of Investigations
A total of 36 archaeological sites were recorded during this project. These are located both along the
originally proposed route, the final route, and in one case, a proposed route adjustment that was later
eliminated from consideration. The sites are each described below, with recommendations for potential
or actual eligibility for State Archeological Landmark or National Register of Historic Places status
included, referenced as eligibility for “state or federal listings.” If necessary, recommendations for
avoidance and/or future work are also included.
41TG577
Site 41TG577 (Figure 2, Figure
18) is a 300m-long lithic
scatter/lithic procurement site
located adjacent to existing
transmission line T-429, about 2.2
mi north of Hwy 853. It is on a
low interfluvial lobe within Cho
association
soils
supporting
scattered juniper and mesquite
over grasses in Antlers Sand and
undivided Quaternary formations.
Portions of the site have been
heavily impacted by past brush
clearing activities. The artifacts
consisted of perhaps 1,000 flakes
of all classes, along with
bidirectional and multidirectional
cores, and several blades or bladelike flakes present. These were
within fair to good quality tabular
chert eroding from limestone
bedrock (indicating, perhaps, a
different geologic formation than
what is shown on BEG maps).
The artifacts were seen over
entirety of the lobe with no visible
patterning
and
no
major
concentrations. The site had the
appearance of having been used
extensively, but not intensively.
Figure 18. Site 41TG577.
No shovel tests were attempted in
this site due to the obviously
shallow soils pocketed in exposed bedrock, and because it was obvious that any subsurface materials
would be a reflection of what was exposed on the surface.
Site 41TG577 is considered fully investigated within and immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW,
and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal listings. No further work or avoidance measures are
considered necessary.

41TG626
Site 41TG626 (Figure 2,Figure
19) is a 345 m-long lithic scatter
with burned rock located just
south of the Twin Buttes
substation and 4.7 mi north of FM
853, adjacent to the existing T429 transmission line. The site is
near the base of a prominent hill
that rises 150 ft above the
transmission line corridor and
overlooks an intermittent stream
250 m to the west. Soils are Tulia
loams supporting young mesquite,
juniper and grasses over Antlers
Sand and undivided Quaternary
deposits.
Observed material
consisted of a number of flakes
within the northern portion of the
site, while across a small drainage
was a diffuse scatter of burned
rock and a relatively dense lithic
scatter which was located on a
low ridge. The chipped stone
assemblage included material
from high quality cobbles and
from a more coarse-grained
source.
About 30 flakes or
fragments were observed across
the site, along with a flake tool
and at least two bidirectional

cores.
The burned rock was
concentrated on the low ridge, and appears to be a disrupted hearth consisting of about 60 rocks of
various sizes. It covered an area of approximately 7 by 13 m, and was oriented downslope (Figure 20). A
total of eight shovel tests (T-001-T-008) were
excavated within and near the site. Only one
was positive for cultural material. Test T-006
was placed just north of the burned rock
concentration and recovered one tertiary chip
from the upper 20 cm. The tests revealed soils
that varied from reddish-brown to grayishbrown loam over silts, clays or gravels, and all
were terminated at depths of 40-50 cm in clays,
dense carbonates, or gravel. Because there is a
PI (point of intersection) structure located just
north of the site, the pulling arc was also
investigated. Based on the lack of subsurface
recovery within the site, this area received
surface-level investigations only. There was
no evidence of the site extending into this area.

32

Site 41TG626 appears to represent a short-term campsite. While it may be an outlier of more substantial
remains, most likely nearer the stream, within the ROW the cultural material is surficial only, and lacks
horizontal integrity, severely limiting any research potential. The site is considered fully investigated
within and immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW, and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal
listings. No further work or avoidance measures are considered necessary.
41TG627
Site 41TG627 (Figure 2, Figure
21) is a 425 m-long lithic
scatter/lithic procurement area/
lithic workshop that is located
about 1,000 m southwest of

stream is located about 250 m to
the west.
Vegetation was
primarily mesquite and juniper
scattered over grasses. Evidence
of extensive past clearing was
obvious. The soils were shallow
and pocketed within exposed
limestone bedrock, and therefore
no shovel tests were excavated
within the site.
Observed
materials consisted of many
hundreds of flakes of all classes,
several cores, perhaps 20 thick
(early stage) bifaces, and apparent
edge-modified flakes, as well as
scattered burned rock. Some of
the edge modified flakes were
probably the result of machine
damage, but some were clearly

rock exhibited no patterning
within the site and may have been from previous land clearing activities.
Site 41TG627 is a lithic procurement site where secondary reduction and possibly other, embedded
procurement or processing took place. The site is within shallow soils and has been severely impacted by
past clearing. The site type holds little interpretative value beyond that already captured by its recording.
The site is considered fully investigated within and immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW, and is
not felt to be eligible for state or federal listings. No further work or avoidance measures are considered
necessary.
41TG628
Site 41TG628 (Figure 3, Figure 22) is a 530 m-long open campsite and lithic scatter located on the north
bank of the Middle Concho River just west of where it enters the Twin Buttes Reservoir flood pool. The
33

site is located primarily on a high
bluff at a juncture of the river and
a meandering, rocky, intermittent
tributary stream. Soils are Cho
association and Rioconcho/Spur
association, observed here as silty
loams over undivided Quaternary
deposits. Vegetation consists of
sparse grasses and spiny shrubs
under scattered mesquite and
juniper. Observed rock outcrops
were gravel conglomerates, and a
large conglomerate overhang was
seen in the bed of the tributary
stream on the west edge of the
ROW; however, it had been
thoroughly scoured and there was
no evidence of cultural use. The
lower, narrow river terrace
contained deep loamy soils where
a shovel test (T-017) placed in that
location, excavated to 95 cm,
found a poorly developed soil to
70 cm where pebbles became
common.
Three small bones
recovered from the upper 20 cm
were probably of recent, natural
origin.
The majority of camping debris
was located on the conglomerate
bench. An apparent burned rock
feature was present near subsurface test T-011. It may have been a large hearth or small oven/burned
rock midden, about 2 m in diameter, but was severely deflated and lacked depth and integrity. Other
observed artifacts included numerous flakes
of all classes, unifaces, a few bifaces, both
thick and thin, two sandstone metate
fragments (among the very few groundstone
artifacts encountered during the entire
project), other scattered burned limestone, a
small amount of mussel shell, and a cluster of
five heavily weathered and battered projectile
points, which all had characteristics of Late
Archaic styles (Figure 23). The clustering of
these points suggested relatively recent
collecting activities, rather than any type of
use area.
Moving upstream along the
drainage there was a continuation of lithic
debitage and occasional tools decreasing in

within the main portion of the site. Test T-011 contained moderate amounts of debitage and burned rock,
excavated through 25 cm of brownish silty loam with decayed limestone over limestone bedrock. T-012
recovered one tertiary flake from 10 cm of soil over bedrock. The remaining three tests (T-013, T-014, T016) encountered 8-10 cm of soil over limestone bedrock.
Site 41TG628, despite being an established open camp, is severely deflated, has been impacted by past
ranching activities, lacks depth and is of questionable horizontal integrity. The site is considered fully
investigated within and immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW, and is not felt to be eligible for state
or federal listings. No further work or avoidance measures are considered necessary.
41TG629
Site 41TG629 (Figure 4, Figure
24) is a minor, 150 m-long lithic
scatter located along the toe and
slopes of a north-facing ridge
overlooking the Middle Concho
River about 400 m to the north. It
is within shallow Tulia loam soils
supporting mesquite and shrubs
and low grasses over undivided
Quaternary deposits. A recently
plowed field planted with native
grasses is included in the
southern-most portion of the site.
The majority of visible artifacts
were seen in conjunction with a
low, small rock outcrop, and
consisted of a few dozen flakes
and widely scattered probable
burned limestone. Three onsite
shovel tests (T-021-T-023) had
minimal recovery (a single
possible secondary flake in T-023)
in shallow (20-50 cm) soils.
Site 41TG629 is considered fully
investigated
within
and
immediately adjacent to the
proposed ROW, and is not felt to
be eligible for state or federal
listings.
No further work or
avoidance
measures
are
considered necessary.

41TG630
Site 41TG630 (Figure 5, Figure 25) is an open terrace campsite located on the north bank of Spring
Creek. It is 100 m long within the ROW and 210 m in width along the stream bank. It is within Tulia
loam and Rioconcho Spur association soils supporting dense prickly pear and tassajillo, young mesquite
and juniper, grasses and scattered oak trees. Larger pecan trees are present nearer the stream. It is
mapped as being within Holocene alluvium. A large gully, about 15 m wide and 2 to 3 m deep, which
may be of recent origin, crosses the site diagonally. The majority of the observed cultural material was
35

along a low ridge or levee between
the creek and the gully. Observed
cultural
materials
included
numerous flakes, cores, early to
mid-stage bifaces, scattered and
semi-concentrated burned limestone, a possible metate fragment,
some mussel shell, a Frio-like
point (Figure 26), and a small
amount of calcined bone from one
shovel test.
Due to the nature of this site it
received reconnaissance investtigation outside of the proposed
ROW in anticipation of possible
route adjustments to avoid the site.
At the southern edge of the site,
about 80 m from the centerline,
was a possible small burned rock
midden within a motte of oak
trees.
Four shovel tests (T-026-T-029)
were excavated within the site,
with two additional tests, T-030
and T-031 confirming the edge of
the site to the north. Shovel test
recovery was light, with only one,
T-028 having reasonable recovery
at depths to 1 m. The remaining
Figure 25. Site 41TG630.
three onsite shovel tests were all
excavated to depths of 1 m through fine silty brown loams. Soil profile changes were minimal. To the
north the soils quickly became a heavy dark clay loam, within and across a low swale that separated the
site from the slopes to the uplands.
Site 41TG630 is not considered to be investigated fully. There is the potential
for buried deposits, including preserved organic remains, and is therefore
considered to be potentially eligible for formal state and/or national listings.
The site, however, will be spanned by the transmission line, and any necessary
clearing will done using minimally invasive methods. If, however, site
avoidance becomes impossible, then additional investigations, coordinated
through the appropriate agencies, should be considered.
41TG631
Site 41TG631(Figure 5, Figure 27, Historic Resource 14A in Appendix 3)) is a
small, historic-aged residential frame structure (Figure 28) located within the

point from 41TG630.
Creek. It is part of a larger residential/farming cluster of structures included in
the visual impacts study (see Appendix, Resource number 14A). The structure is within Tobosa series
soils in open grassland or pasture over Fluviatile terrace deposits. The house is small, about 18 ft on a
36

side, with a narrow kitchen space
to the west (about 18 x 8 ft) and
an
informally
divided
living/sleeping area in the
reminder of the east side. There
are no windows on the west
(kitchen) side. Doors are located
on the southeast corner and the
south center. It is clad in asbestos
siding and has an asphalt roof. It
has 2.5 inch tongue-in-groove
flooring, 2x8 rafters and floor
joists, 2x6 roof joists, knob-andtube wiring, gypsum wallboard,
and a "Servel" gas-powered
refrigerator, which Googled to
production between 1933 and
1957. The house rests on both
cinder block and wood piers.
Two shovel tests (T-040, T-041)
were excavated in the vicinity of
the structure, both of which were
negative for cultural material.
Associated artifacts were limited
to a couple of bricks, some
window glass, and a couple of
glass jars. About 170 m to the
north, within a wooded slope, is a
pile of cement rubble, noted here

ranch (Bryant) said that Mexican laborers once stayed there, as well as in metal grain silos located near
the road.
Site 41TG631 is considered fully investigated
(archaeologically) within and immediately
adjacent to the proposed ROW, and is not felt
to be eligible for state or federal listings. No
further work or avoidance measures are
considered necessary.
Additionally, the
structure itself is considered to not be
architecturally or otherwise significant in
regards to federal-level criteria. Unless the
structure is moved by landowners it will be
dismantled as part of the transmission line
construction process.

41TG632
Site 41TG632 (Figure 6, Figure 29) is a 180 m-long lithic scatter located upon a high terrace within
Quaternary alluvium near the west bank of Dove Creek. It is within an active horse pasture containing
sparse, short grass in Rioconcho Spur soils. Observed material consisted of about a dozen flakes, two
nice unifaces, the medial section of a thin biface, and perhaps 15 fire-fractured limestone rocks. The
landowner had also collected from the site, and displayed about 10 flakes, a couple of cores and some
chert chunks. Four shovel testes, (T-042-044, T47) were excavated within the site. Only one, T-043, was
positive for cultural material, and this was limited to two chert chips in the upper 20 cm. The shovel test
profiles generally consisted of brownish, dense silty loams to depths of 80 cm. Carbonates tended to
increase with depth, and in some cases pebbles were encountered. This site may have been a short term
encampment, but this cannot be demonstrated.
Site 41TG632 is considered fully investigated within and immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW,
and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal listings. No further work or avoidance measures are
considered necessary.
41TG633
Site 41TG633 (Figure 6, Figure
29) is a 50 m-long lithic scatter,
located immediately east of
41TG632, and is upon the first
stable terrace of Dove Creek in
mapped Quaternary alluvium with
eroded and depleted RioconchoSpur soils barely supporting
scattered grass, prickly pear and
mesquite. A minor tributary to
Dove Creek clearly separates this
site from 41TG632. Observed
artifacts consisted of about a
dozen flakes, one nice uniface,
and perhaps 15 scattered firefractured limestone rocks. Two
shovel tests (T-045 and T-046)
were excavated within the site.
Test T-045 contained a total of 5
flakes, 8 chips and 1 chunk within
40 cm of gray silty loam that
terminated in dense gravels. The
second test encountered dense
gravels at a depth of 20 cm. This
site, like 41TG632, may have
been a short term camp, although
this cannot be demonstrated in
either case.
Site 41TG633 is considered fully

41TG634
Site 41TG634 (Figure 6, Figure
30) is primarily a historic-aged
house site within an extremely
minor lithic scatter. It is located
about 0.50 mi south of Dove
Creek and just north of Guinn
Road. It is within shallow Cho
soils with mesquite, juniper,
prickly pear and agarita over
undivided Quaternary deposits.
An existing north/south trending
ranch road bisects the site. There
are two primary sets of artifacts,
one that dates to the turn-of-the(twentieth) century and the other
that dates to the mid twentieth
century. Mostly on the surface
and to the east of the road are
several cut nails, stove fragments,
whiteware, purple (solarized)
glass, as well as amber, clear and
brown glass and whiteware
sherds. West of the road a shovel
test encountered what appeared to
be a dump or burn pile of
materials that included sheet
metal, wire nails, clear glass, a .22
cal shell, a rivet and a suspender
buckle. On the western edge of
the site were three large limestone
Figure 30. Site 41TG634.
rocks that were thought to
possibly represent foundation stones. Four shovel tests (T-053-T-056) within the site had variable
recovery with soils not exceeding 30 cm in depth over limestone. Although this site clearly appears to be
the location of a domestic structure, there is absolutely no evidence of it other than the artifact scatter, as
the large limestone rocks are inconclusive. Additionally, Mr. Darren Fowler, the working tenant of the
property, had no knowledge of a structure ever having been at that location (Darren Fowler, personal
communication 2011). The evidence suggests a late nineteenth century residence and a later addition or
perhaps outbuilding. At some point any structures were apparently removed from the property, rather
than burned or allowed to decay in place.
According to title and courthouse records obtained by LCRA real estate staff, and the further research by
the author, the property upon which historic site 41TG634 is located can be traced back to the Jacob
Gebhardt (aka Gebhard) Survey, which was patented to his heirs in 1859. A structure is mapped on the
georeferenced 1893 Sherwood map very near the site location, however other aspects of the map, such as
the location of Knickerbocker, Dove Creek, and the road system align poorly, casting doubt on the house
alignment. If, however, the structure location is accurate, then the ranch road now on private property
was once the main road south and west out of Knickerbocker. By 1893, John R. Box was operating the
Box Irrigated Farm and had water rights on the property along with 1,929 shares of stock in the San Jose
Irrigation and Power Company, established by Joseph Tweedy (Waring 2011) in 1885 (Tweedy 2011). In
39

1890 the San Jose Irrigation and Power Company served some 1,500 acres (Tweedy 1890 [2010]). These
water rights transferred to C. R. Jameson, and then to M. A. Bletsch in 1928, the same year Bletsch sold
the property and water rights to L. W. Walker. By 1957 the land was owned by a W. B. Abbot and his
wife Ladelle Abbot, who sold to three Cauble siblings in that year. The land has remained with the
Caubles since. The period of potential significance for the historic component is clearly associated with
the Box Irrigated farm (see discussion of 41TG647). The homesite, however, by itself does little increase
knowledge of the farm or early irrigation in Tom Green County.
The prehistoric component of this site consists of a very few pieces of apparent lithic debitage that were
observed while recording the historic component. There was no evidence of increasing materials either
north or south of the site within the ROW.
Site 41TG634 is considered fully investigated within and immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW,
and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal listings. No further work or avoidance measures are
considered necessary.
41TG635
Site 41TG635 (Figure 4, Figure 31) is a historic home location associated with the Tankersley Ranch,
according to Mr. Joe Collins,
present landowner and Tankersley
family member (Joe Collins,
personal communication, August
2010), . The site is located in
heavily disturbed open pasture just
north of the intersection of Hwys
2235 and 67. A plowed field is
immediately south, across a
barbed wire fence.
Soils are
mapped as Angelo clay loams
within the undivided Quaternary
formation. The nearest substantial
water source is Spring Creek,
located about 1.5 mi to the south.
The site consists primarily of a
cement slab, oriented northeast/southwest, about 10 x 20 ft in size
(Figure 32). An old driveway is
still visible from a gate on Hwy
67. About 60 ft to the west of the
slab are two side-by-side pits,
which although once may have
been root cellars, are at present the
remains of a simple septic or
wastewater treatment system. One
pit was fed by 4 inch PVC from
the slab area and was connected to
the second by another 4 inch
overflow pipe. The pits were
crudely covered by wooden
Figure 31. Site 41TG635
beams, old galvanized fencing,
corrugated metal, and soil.
40

Mr. Joe Collins remembered that this site originally
held a pier and beam house with wrap-around porch
and was a portion of the ranch complex that is located a
short distance (1,000 ft) to the southwest. By the 1950s
it had been replaced by a small house on the slab that
tied into a trailer house on the west side. At one time it
probably held Mexican laborers. Mr. Collins also said
that for a period of time in the 1950s an artist from
Arizona, Dusty Waller, lived there. A short Google
search found no information on Waller.
More
information on the Tankersley Ranch complex is in
Appendix 3 (Resources 06A-H).

Figure 32. Cement slab at 41TG635, looking
north.

Four shovel tests, T-061-T-064 were excavated around the
slab and at an artifact scatter located about 100 ft north of
the slab. These tests encountered shallow silty loams over
gravels. All tests had artifacts within the upper 20 cm or so,
and included both early (cut nails, solarized glass, buttons)
and late (wire nails, a sheetrock toggle bolt, finishing nails)
artifacts (Figure 33). Three pennies were found on the
surface, and dated to 1943, 1978, and 1980.

further work or avoidance measures are considered necessary.
41TG636
Site 41TG636 (Figure 9, Figure 34) is a 130 m-diameter lithic scatter located at the base of a ridge and
along a small tributary to Bois D’Arc Draw. It is within Angelo silty clay and overlaps Tarrant soils in
Caliche and Gravel deposits interfingered with Segovia formation limestone. Vegetation consists of an
open, savanna-like setting with grasses, juniper, mesquite and brush growing primarily along the stream
channel. Recent clearing was evident by way of brush piles. Visibility was good to excellent along the
creek and within erosional features. Observed artifacts consisted of a few dozen flakes, three unifaces, a
thick biface, and two unidirectional cores. These materials were primarily south of the creek. An arrow
point preform was found near a push pile just north of the creek. Because the site was located at a PI
location, the pulling easements were also investigated outside the standard right-of-way. A total of six
shovel tests (T-077-T-082) was excavated to determine the site boundaries. Soils were typically about 20
cm of brown loam over gravelly loam terminating over gravels and bedrock at 50 cm or less. Only test T081 was positive for possible cultural material, with one chert chunk and one piece of chert shatter in the
upper 20 cm.
Site 41TG636 is a diffuse lithic scatter with a few tools that is almost entirely surficial in nature. It is
located between two lithic procurement sites (41TG651 and 41TG637) and represents a pattern of minor
camps and lithic scatters - possibly short term workshops - seen at elevations below major lithic sources.
Site 41TG636 is considered fully investigated within and immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW,

41

and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal listings. No further work or avoidance measures are
considered necessary.
41TG637
Site 41TG637 (Figure 9, Figure
34) is a lithic procurement site
located along the slopes of a ridge
system overlooking the Bois
D’Arc Draw drainage to the north.
Soils are mapped as Tarrant series,
and were observed as shallow to
nonexistent
over
Segovia
formation limestone. Vegetation
was mostly open with prickly pear
and brush with small juniper and
larger oaks near the base of the
slope. Observed artifacts consisted
of flakes, at least 100 cores,
several unifaces, several thick
bifaces and one thin biface. The
raw material is a nodular, highquality brown chert eroding from
the surrounding limestone. The
majority of this is visible about
midslope on the hillside. Due to
excellent visibility and the
obviously shallow soils pocketed
in exposed limestone bedrock, no
shovel tests were attempted.
Site 41TG637 is one of several

procurement sites encountered

limestone, especially in the
southern portion of the project area. Some of these
sites appeared to have reached exhaustion, i.e., there
was little easily obtainable raw material that had not
already been reduced. This site was about midway in
that continuum, with raw chert nodules still readily
available.
Site 41TG637 is considered fully
investigated within and immediately adjacent to the
proposed ROW, and is not felt to be eligible for state
or federal listings. No further work or avoidance
measures are considered necessary.

Observed
artifacts consisted of several
dozens of flakes and widely
scattered burned limestone. A few
flake tools and unifaces were
observed, along with a “chopper”
core, two thick bifaces, perhaps
four thin bifaces, and two
fragmentary projectile points,
which were probably Late Archaic
in age (Figure 38). Only one core
was seen. Across the dissected
stream channel was a north bank
terrace, which at first was thought
to be a continuation of the site,
based on very sparse surficial
artifacts.

disproved that (T-223-T-226).

first and a chert flake and chunk in the second,

brown clay loam over dense brown clay or caliche
at depths of 40 to 50 cm. Machine augered tests
encountered pale brown to pinkish silts to depths
of 140 cm, although usually caliche and gravels
were at around 100 cm.
When first encountered, 41TG638 appeared to
hold promise for containing buried cultural
material. Subsurface testing, however, confirmed
that the site is surficial in nature. Furthermore,

41TG639
Site 41TG639 (Figure 9, see Figure 36) is a 100 m-diameter
lithic scatter located on a high bluff immediately north of,
and across the drainage from, 41TG639. It is within shallow
Tarrant and Dev and Rioconcho soils over Segovia formation
limestone. Vegetation consists of tassajillo, prickly pear,
yucca, juniper and oaks, with the trees nearer the bluff edge.
Observed artifacts consisted of no more than a dozen flakes,
two flake tools (unifacial), a core, and an unidentifiable dart
point stem. This last had edge grinding and may have been
Early Archaic in age. Due to the obviously shallow soils
pocketed within limestone bedrock and otherwise excellent
visibility, no shovel tests were attempted.

Figure 38. Bifaces from 41TG638.

Site 41TG639 is a minor lithic scatter, probably located to take advantage of a terrain feature offering
excellent visibility across the drainage system to the south (see Figure 36). It is considered fully
investigated within and immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW, and is not felt to be eligible for state
or federal listings. No further work or avoidance measures are considered necessary.
41TG640
Site 41TG640 (Figure 8, Figure
39, Figure 40) is a complex
prehistoric site, about 200 m in
diameter, consisting of a small,
crescent-shaped
burden
rock
midden, two sets of mortar holes
with cupules and associated
petroglyphs
engraved
into
limestone bedrock, surrounding by
a light scatter of camping debris.
It is along and within Burks Creek,
primarily the south side. The main
portion of the site is in Dev and
Rioconcho soils, corresponding
with a Holocene alluvial terrace,
but Angelo silty clay and Tarrant
soils are also present around the
periphery, especially to the south,
where the Segovia limestone
formation is present. It is in
relatively
undisturbed
open
pasture, used primarily for goats,
with scattered brush and other low
vegetation and established oak
trees along the drainage. Eight
shovel tests (T-085, T-086, T-090T-095) placed within the ROW,
were excavated to depths up to 60
cm.

encountered a dense burned rock lens in the upper 20 cm, which is either an outlier of the burned rock
midden (most probably) or a separate feature. There was no suggestion of buried components elsewhere,
and the tests were terminated in extremely dense silty clays. Observations along the stream bank, a small
side drainage, and erosional features supported this conclusion. Otherwise, surficial artifacts were fairly
sparse, consisting of fairly numerous flakes, a few cores, a uniface, and a Scallorn-esque arrowpoint
fragment, found near the burned rock midden. Due to the nature of the site and obvious concerns for the
area of potential effect, especially regarding crossing the stream, the site was defined to its maximum
extent on either side of the ROW. Feature recording was accomplished through photography, sketches,
and GPS shots.
The burned rock midden is located at the junction of a small north-trending drainage and Burks Creek
(Figure 41). It is 8 m in diameter, with the crescent opening away from the creek, to the southeast. No
testing was attempted within this feature, although the stream-side profile indicates it is up to 1 m in
thickness. Seventy-five m to the southwest is mortar hole Cluster 1. It consists of 10 mortar holes that
range from 8 to 18 cm in diameter and are as shallow as 1.5 cm and as deep as 19 cm, although most are
less than 10 cm in depth. These are all in a large piece of limestone bedrock within the creek bed, and
cover an area about 7 m in diameter.
About 6 m south of Cluster 1, very near the southern edge of the same limestone slab, was Cluster 1b. It
consisted of 5 mortar holes, each 9 to 12 cm in diameter and 3 to 4 cm deep (Mortar Group 2). A number
of small cupules were interspersed with these mortars. These are all in an area about 4 m in diameter.
Primarily to the northwest was a set of pecked petroglyphs. There were two sets of two concentric circles
and other vague linear and geometric patterns, as well as possible deer hooves. In some cases intentional
pecking was difficult to separate from natural erosion, and a revisit during early morning hours reinforced
the shallow nature of the glyphs, as they were much more visible with a low sun angle (Figure 42, Figure
43, Figure 44, Figure 45, and see Figure 96).
About 90 m north of Cluster 1 was Cluster 2, which consisted of eight deep mortars, either round or oval
(Mortar Group 3). No petroglyphs were present at this location. These were on a large, flat boulder,
about 15 m in diameter, also within the creek bed. They ranged from 8 to 18 cm in diameter and were
between 25 and 31 cm deep (Figure 46, Figure 47).
About 75 m northeast was the final Cluster 3. This was the only cluster within the ROW as defined at the
time of survey. It consisted of four cupules and four assumed atlatl symbols. These atlatl symbols are
comprised of a pecked, open circle about 20 cm in diameter bisected by a short, straight line, in some
cases widening on one end. These symbols were aligned north and northeast. Also in this cluster was
what was referred to in the field as the “NZ” petroglyph. It may represent two elongated atlatl symbols
joined at the butt ends (Figure 48, Figure 49).
Further to the southeast, within shallow Tarrant soils overlying the Segovia formation were seen three
clusters of burned rock, apparently representing disrupted hearths. These were surficial in nature, and
limited testing as well as surface observation revealed minimal numbers of nearby artifacts. These
features offer very little in the way of research potential.
The burned rock midden, mortar hole and petroglyph features comprising 41TG640 are all considered
eligible for formal listing as a State Archeological Landmark and potentially eligible for nomination to
the National Register of Historic Places. It is recommended that no construction impacts be allowed to
impact these features. The site deposits, however, are surficial and lack horizontal integrity, so limited,
controlled vehicular movement through the site is feasible, although not desirable.

Following the recording of 41TG640, the transmission line was shifted slightly northward, primarily to
avoid crossing a water well located to the southeast, and secondarily to avoid crossing the site. Site
41TG640 is permanently noted on project plans as a “sensitive environmental area” and LCRA Cultural
resources staff will coordinate with other project personnel to ensure continued avoidance.
41TG641
Site 41TG641 (Figure 7, Figure 50) is a 90 m-long lithic scatter located along the head of a small drainage
that eventually joins Dove Creek about 3.5 km to the north. It is located within Tarrant association soils
over Fort Terrett formation limestone supporting open grassland with scattered prickly pear, tassajillo and
small mesquite trees. Numerous uprooted juniper stumps are present in this area. Observed artifacts
consisted of three multidirectional cores, about six flakes and one edge-modified flake. Due to the
obvious shallow soils pocketed in exposed bedrock, as well as examination of erosional features, no
shovel tests were attempted at this location.

47

Site 41TG641 is a very minor
lithic scatter. Although it appears
to not be the result of
redeposition,
it
has
been
impacted by past clearing and
ranching activities, and also has
insufficient data potential to
warrant any further investigations. It is considered fully
investigated within and immediately adjacent to the proposed
ROW, and is not felt to be
eligible for state or federal
listings. No further work or
avoidance
measures
are
considered necessary.
41TG642
Site 41TG642 (Figure 6, Figure
51) is one of a cluster of sites on
either side of Dove Creek. This
site is a large (40 x 120 m)
burned rock midden within a
larger 90 x 190 m site area on the
edge of the main right bank
stream terrace. Soils are mapped
as Rioconcho and Spur series
over
Holocene
alluvium.
Vegetation is relatively dense
brush, juniper and mesquite with
prickly pear and tassajillo across

the midden surface (Figure 52).
The midden fronts a pecan bottom on the lower Dove Creek terrace to the west and a plowed agricultural
field to the east.
Across the surface, chert artifacts were common, but not dense, and consisted primarily of chert debitage.
A Nolan point stem and two Bulverde points were seen on or near the midden, as well as three or four
thin bifaces probably representing broken projectile points. Notably absent was ground stone. Thirteen
shovel tests (T-108-111, T-114, T-132-T-135, T-148-T-151) were excavated within the midden or around
its periphery. Additionally, two backhoe trenches were excavated, one (BHT 3) outside the midden on
the lower, pecan bottom terrace, and the other (BHT 1) at the PI structure location within the plowed field
east of the midden.
Subsurface tests T-108-T-110 were placed within the main portion of the midden. Burned rock recovery
was greatest between 20 and 60 cm below ground surface, and dropped off dramatically below that. The
soil was not particularly dense with organic material, and was either a brown silty loam or grayish brown
clay or silt loam. Lithic debitage was frequent and included core reduction flakes and biface thinning
flakes. Test T-150 was notable for a burned rock lens at 23-43 cm bgs. Other than a couple of bones,
faunal material was limited to a few fragments of mussel shell. Outside the identified boundaries of the
midden, (T-133-T135, T-148, T-149, T-151) there was minimal to moderate recovery. Soils ranged from
gray brown silt and clay loams to very dense clay loams or clay.
48

Backhoe trench 1 was placed at
the angle structure to be located
in the plowed field just east of the
midden feature. Its profile was
recorded in T-114, a shovel test
placed off the edge of the trench.
From 0-38 cm was gray brown
silty clay loam. From 38-68 cm
was a transition to silty clay and
to a final excavated depth of 128
cm was dense brown clay. No
artifacts were recovered in either
the trench or the wall test.
Backhoe trench 3 was placed in
the pecan bottom on the terrace
immediately below the midden
feature. It had a thick (60 cm)
zone of dark grayish brown clay
loam over about 25 cm of gray
clay loam with dense carbonate
staining. Below this, gray silty
clay transitioned to yellowish
brown silt loam with abundant
limestone pebbles/detritus that
appeared to be water deposited.
These pebbles increased in size
with depth (Figure 53).
The burned rock midden portion
of the site appeared to be
relatively undisturbed, although
Figure 51. Site 41TG642.
there were some areas where
recent brush burning had occurred, and some
minor animal burrowing. The original site
form for the site recommended complete
avoidance by equipment during construction
or later maintenance activities.
A conversation with the present land manager
resulted in learning that the entire midden had
been “pushed” for brush within the past 15-20
years
(Darren
Fowler,
personal
communication, February9, 2011). This fact
explains the young mesquite across the site,
as well as the scattered burned rock seen
across the surface. However, the subsurface
portions of the site almost certainly maintain
some integrity.
Site 41TG642 is split from (rather than
lumped with) sites 41TG645, 41TG646,

environment. Looking east, plowed field is behind trees.

41TG647 and 41TG648 for data management purposes. These
sites all represent repetitive and probably continuous use of
Dove Creek over prehistoric time. Site 41TG642 is considered
to be potentially eligible for formal listing as a State
Archeological Landmark and/or inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places. No transmission structures will be
placed within this site. It is recommended that heavy equipment
be restricted from traveling across the midden portion of this site
during construction activities. Subsurface tests T-148-T-151
were placed north of the transmission line corridor in
anticipation of a pulling easement being required in that
direction. However, construction personnel have determined
that all pulling activities can be accomplished within the open,
plowed field, thereby avoiding midden deposits. Given that the
midden has been previously disturbed by brush clearing, it is
recommended that any necessary clearing across the midden
surface be accomplished by a Seppie or similar equipment that
does not involve removing brush and trees by the roots

(grubbing, bulldozing, chaining). Otherwise, if the site requires
subsurface impacts as a result of the transmission line project then limited subsurface testing should be
considered.
41TG643
Site 41TG643 (Figure 6, Figure 54)
is a 60 m-long lithic scatter located
on the west side of Dove Creek
adjacent to a subdivision road. It is
on one of a series of small lobes
overlooking the creek, which is
about 350 m to the east. It is within
undulating Kimbrough association
soils supporting grasses and various
small shrubs over the Antlers Sand
formation. At present it is a recently
cleared field with bulldozed brush
piles common. Gravel fill has been
imported and thinly covers some
portions of the site.
Four subsurface tests (T-127, T129-131) were placed within the
site. These tests were excavated
through 20-60 cm of brown silty
loam to caliche, very dense silt, or
gravels. Recovery was limited to a
single chert chunk in one, two chips
in another and two fragments of
clear glass in a third.
Site 41TG643 is a very minor lithic
scatter. It has been impacted by past

clearing and ranching activities, and lacks data potential to warrant any further investigations. It is
considered fully investigated within and immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW, and is not felt to be
eligible for state or federal listings. No further work or avoidance measures are considered necessary.
41TG644
Site 41TG644 (Figure 9, Figure 55, Figure 37) is a 415 m-long (within the ROW) lithic procurement site
located across a relatively restricted upland lobe that overlooks Bois D’Arc Draw, located about 500 m to
the northeast. It is within Segovia formation limestone and primarily shallow Tarrant series soils with
thin grass and occasional oak trees. The entire lobe has been cleared of brush and is heavily impacted
with upturned limestone bedrock common. No shovel tests were excavated. Observed materials consist
of numerous flakes and cores, several early and mid-stage bifaces, and a few unifaces. These have been
fashioned from a high quality brown to grayish brown nodular chert that is eroding from the parent
limestone, and in many cases visible as large inclusions within it. These artifacts are most common
across the top of the ridge, but continue downslope and northward into the cleared pasture below. No
time diagnostic artifacts were seen.
Although 41TG644 is considered
a relatively major procurement
site, one that has not been
exhausted, it has been severely
disturbed by past clearing
activities, is typical of numerous
such sites in the area, and has
limited research potential. It is
considered fully investigated
within and immediately adjacent
to the proposed ROW, and is not
felt to be eligible for state or
federal listings. No further work
or avoidance measures are
considered necessary.
41TG645
Site 41TG645 (Figure 6, Figure
56) is a lithic scatter with diffuse
burned rock and occasional
mussel shell located upon and
around a low gravel knoll within
plowed field immediately east of
burned rock midden site 41TG642
on the right bank of Dove Creek
just west of Knickerbocker. The
area is mapped as alluvial
floodplain deposits (Qal) with
Rioconcho and Spur series soils.
The knoll consists of a remnant
outcrop of limestone and other

gravels over caliche, and is
surrounded entirely by the plowed field (Figure 57). A small gravel borrow pit has been excavated on the
knoll, which has scattered grass, mesquite, tassajillo and prickly pear.

51

This site was recorded due to an
anticipated pulling easement that
will be required at the angle
structure located within the plowed
field between this site and the
burned rock midden.
Four
subsurface tests (T-146, T-147, T152, T-153) were excavated within
the site’s boundaries. Test T-153
was placed on the edge of the knoll
and encountered large limestone
cobbles at about 30 cm. Tests
within the field recovered small to
moderate amounts of lithic
debitage, burned limestone and
mussel shell at depths of up to 60
cm. Soils consisted of 30-40 cm of
brown silty loams over carbonaterich gravelly loam. Other observed
artifacts consisted of chert
debitage, a few informal tools,
scattered burned limestone and
mussel shell.
Site 41TG645 appears to represent
an open camp, possibly taking
advantage of the slightly higher
elevation of the knoll, as well as
the raw limestone available there.
The site within the field has been
impacted by decades of plowing,
Figure 56. Site 41TG645.
while the knoll top is shallow,
deflated, and impacted by borrowing
activities and the storing of farm equipment.
There is little research potential beyond that
already gathered from the survey-level
recording, and the site within and near the
pulling easement is considered fully
investigated within and immediately
adjacent to the proposed ROW, and is not
felt to be eligible for state or federal listings.
No further work or avoidance measures are
considered necessary.
41TG646
Site 41TG646 (Figure 6, Figure 58) is a 280
m-long open campsite located within the
large agricultural field on the right bank of
Dove Creek just west of Knickerbocker, as
well as within a mesquite brush patch
adjacent to a pasture road. It is within

mapped Holocene terrace deposits
(Qal formation) covered by
Rioconcho and Spur soils. West
of the plowed field the mesquite
patch is relatively dense with
young mesquite, tassajillo, prickly
pear and other shrubs (Figure 59).
The site has an indefinite
boundary to the south, where there
is a dip in the topography
accompanied by a decrease in
surface artifacts before a gradual,
stony rise prior to 41TG647. The
site consists of surficial chert
artifacts,
primarily
debitage,
scattered burned limestone, and
occasional mussel shell.
Two
limestone metate fragments were
seen as well, among the very few
pieces of ground stone seen during
this project.
This site is within a portion of the
line that will require a 200 ft-wide
ROW with multiple structures (up
to three) across the ROW width,
due to a lower profile necessitated
by a nearby airstrip. For that
reason the site was extensively
tested in order to determine if
buried features (see 41TG648)
Figure 58. Sites 41TG646 (center), 41TG647 (south) and 41TG448.
were present.
Twenty-one
subsurface tests (T-115, T-140-142, T-154162, T-267, T-269-274, T-280) and one
backhoe trench (BHT2) were excavated within
or very near the site’s boundaries. Use of a
machine-mounted auger allowed consistent
testing of the very dense silty clay soils to
depths of 100-140 cm. Twelve of the tests
were positive for cultural material, which
consisted of small to moderate amounts of
lithic debitage, burned limestone, and mussel
shell, almost entirely within the upper 40 cm
of soil. Subsurface test T-141 recovered a
well-made thin biface from within the upper
20 cm. There was little to no horizon
development, with soils consisting of brown or

presumed illuviation of clay particles.
53

Backhoe Trench 2, recorded as the profile for T-115, had 42 cm of grayish brown clay loam, then brown
silty pebbly clay loam to 74 cm, then brown clay loam with increasing carbonates to a depth of 134 cm,
followed by a powdery grayish brown silty loam to a final depth of 146 cm. No artifacts were
encountered within the backhoe trench.
Site 41TG646 appears to represent generalized camping activities which are probably present along much
of Dove Creek. There is no evidence of identifiable buried cultural zones within the site’s boundaries,
and it has been previously disturbed by clearing and plowing. The research potential is considered low
for this site, and it is considered fully investigated within and immediately adjacent to the proposed
ROW, and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal listings. No further work or avoidance measures
are considered necessary.
41TG647
Site 41TG647 (Figure 6, see Figure 58) is a
multicomponent 40 m-long prehistoric lithic
scatter with tools and scattered burned
limestone, as well as a concrete covered tanklike feature that was subsequently determined
to be part of an irrigation system that was in
use through the 1970s, but was established as
early as 1893. The site is on the right bank of
Dove Creek within mapped Holocene alluvial
deposits (Qal formation) with Rioconcho/Spur
series and Angelo clay loam soils. It is upon a
low gravel ridge comprised mostly of
limestone visible within the plowed field.
Hackberry and mesquite trees grow along a
fence that borders the northern edge of the site
(Figure 60).

Figure 60. Site 41TG647, looking south, cement feature is
behind truck.

The prehistoric component consists of numerous flakes, scattered burned limestone, occasional mussel
shell fragments, and a few stone tools. An Early Archaic Wells-like point was found on the surface near
the cement feature, and a Marshall-like point was seen outside the ROW to the west. Six subsurface tests
(T-143, T-163-164, T-275, T-279, T-280) were placed within or very near the site. Only two (T-162, T164) were positive for cultural material which consisted of minimal amounts of debitage, burned rock and
mussel shell. One aqua glass fragment was also recovered. Soils were silt loams that encountered pale
brown silt with carbonates at depths below about 50 cm, or dense limestone cobbles when nearer the
cobble outcrop.
The historic component consists of a cement trough-like feature that measures about 20 feet in length, is 5
feet wide, and about 2 feet tall (Figure 61). It is covered by a poured-in-place cement top. All pours are
about 4 inches wide. The feature is open on both ends, is partially buttressed on the north side, where
there is a partial opening about 4 x 6 feet in size. Metal plates further compartmentalize the very northern
portion of the feature. (See also Appendix C, Resources 27A, 27B.)
Conversations with the current farmer (Darren Fowler) leasing the land indicated that this is part of an
irrigation system that was in operation until about 1980, when his grandfather entered in to a lease
agreement with the present owners (Caubles). The land has been dry-farmed since. This feature is
interpreted as a distribution hub for water that was pumped from nearby Dove Creek. The metal sheets
were most likely gates that allowed water to flow in various directions, as needed.
54

Deed research conducted by the author, and a
contracted real estate professional, primarily
for nearby historic homestead site 41TG634,
provided additional information on the
property and its irrigation history. According
to an affidavit witnessed June 29, 1914, one
John R. Box, apparently in response to
recently enacted legislation, probably
connected with withdrawal of water form
reservoirs, testified that he owned the land
known at that time as the Box Irrigated Farm
(Tom Green County Deed Records, Vol. 75
p. 72). Box stated that he had operated the
irrigation system continuously for over 20
years, utilizing a small dam and two pumps
Figure 61. Cement irrigation feature at 41TG647. Looking
with 10-inch suction pipes and about 20 feet
north.
of head.
His was a “priority [water]
right…of the oldest on the creek…also covered by the San Jose Irrigation and Power Company” of which
he was one of the largest stakeholders. The dam was described as brush and rock and about 4 feet in
height. (Careful examination of the modern USGS quad maps for this portion of Dove Creek suggests
numerous small impoundments.) Box not only irrigated some 500 acres of land, he also tied in, with at
least two lateral lines, to the San Jose Irrigation and Power Company ditch system, which began at the
San Jose Irrigation Dam in Irion County and ran for approximately 6.5 miles, paralleling the south side of
Dove Creek, before rejoining the creek about 1.5 miles north of Knickerbocker. Along the way it
apparently irrigated at least two other farms.
It is unknown what the size of the main ditch was, but the lateral lines were five feet wide, about 2.5 feet
deep and dropped 0.30 feet for every 100 feet of run. The capacity was stated to be 2500 gallons per
minute (gpm). The pumps were each capable of providing up to 2000 gpm. Box used both the pumped
water and gravity flow from the San Jose system for irrigation purposes. The primary ditch as well as the
lateral lines were not seen within the transmission line corridor, although a very large ditch, about 20 feet
wide and 10 feet deep was crossed outside the ROW, as was a much smaller one somewhat to the north.
These may represent the primary and lateral lines.
Box’s Pump No. 1 is located about 200 m (0.1 mi) west of the centerline of the transmission line. It was
noted while driving to the high probability survey areas (Figure 62). It consists of a propane powered
pump mounted on a cement slab, with iron piping extending to the creek below. Discontinuous
galvanized piping runs westward towards the plowed field (Figure 63). The propane tank has a date of
manufacture of 1973. The irrigation piping does not appear to be very old, but some of the iron gate
valves are of indeterminate age. The cement slab that houses the propane tank and creek side piping and
pump is of very similar workmanship to the feature at 41TG647. A set of initials, RER and JCE, are
engraved within the slab by the creek. These initials have not been associated with any persons. Well
outside the ROW is a stack of lightweight irrigation piping. Mr. Fowler suggests that the system could be
reestablished, if anyone so chose.
Water rights and stock in the San Jose Irrigation company continued to transfer with the property until at
least 1928, when C. R. Jameson sold to M. A. and Ollie Bletsch (Tom Green County Deed Records Vol.
14 p. 255). By 1957, when W. B. Abbot and wife Ladelle sell to the Cauble family, riparian rights are
transferred, but there is no mention of irrigation systems (Tom Green County Deed Records, Vol. 389 p.
273).

Looking west.

At 41TG647, a lithic scatter with burned rock
and mussel shell continues a pattern of
surficial, scattered camping debris seen along
this portion of Dove Creek. This prehistoric
component lack integrity and has very limited
research potential, and is therefore considered
fully investigated within and immediately
adjacent to the proposed ROW, and is not felt
to be eligible for state or federal listings. No
further work or avoidance measures are
considered necessary.
The historic component at 41TG647, which
consists of a standing cement box associated
with irrigated farming, is a component of a

operation. Conceptually, the entire system
might be considered to be locally or extralocally significant. The individual components, however, are either missing (an obvious ditch system),
have been taken out of commission (the pump and box), or placed into indefinite storage (the irrigation
piping). Additionally, there have modifications to the system, and it is highly unlikely that any remnants
remain in unaltered form. For these reasons, the feature at 41TG647 is considered to be fully investigated
and lacks the integrity necessary for consideration as a listed state of federal resource. However, the
cement feature has been identified to project engineers. It is located on the extreme edge of the ROW,
and no transmission line structures are planned for that area. Therefore, there will be no direct impacts to
the feature, and no further work or avoidance measures are considered necessary.
41TG648
Site 41TG648 (Figure 6, Figure 58) is a discrete, buried burned rock feature located below the plowed
field surface on the right bank of Dove Creek within the complex of largely surficial sites in that area. It
is within mapped Holocene alluvium (Qal formation) with Rioconcho and Spur series soils. It is 50 m
north of 41TG64 and about 150 m south of site 41TG642 and 41TG645.
56

The site was discovered as a burned rock lens in
subsurface test T-137, where about 2,000 gm of
burned rock and three chert chips were recovered
from a depth of 50-75 cm. Test T-139, located 10 m
south of the feature, had very minimal recovery, as
did test T-138, located 30 m to the north. Soils were
brownish silt or clay loams with increasing clay
content to depth of 100 cm.
Two backhoe trenches (BHTs 4 and 5) were placed
10 m south of the feature and at the feature location,
respectively. BHT 4 was excavated to a depth of 150
cm. Soils encountered were gray clay loams to
depths of about 70 cm, with calcium carbonate
nodules seen between about 50 and 70 cm. Below
that was brownish clay and then silt loam to the final
depth. Backhoe trench 5 was placed 2.5 m north of
T-137. It was carefully excavated to a final depth of
75 cm, where it was halted and the bottom of the
trench troweled. The profile was 65 cm of brown
clay loam over 10 cm of slightly darker clay loam.
Troweling the bottom of the trench revealed nine
burned rocks. No other artifacts were noted.

Figure 64. Backhoe trench 5 at 41TG648. Note
soil profile and burned rock on trench bottom.

Site 41TG648 is a buried burned rock feature, either
a large hearth or small oven, which is less than 10 m in diameter. The site has not been fully investigated,
and its research potential remains unknown. Out of 56 subsurface tests placed within the surrounding
landform, this was the only such feature located. It is therefore considered an anomaly, most likely due to
unique site formation processes at that specific location. The location of 41TG648 is no longer crossed
by the proposed transmission line. Therefore, although the site is potentially eligible for formal state or
federal listing, it will not be impacted by the present project, and no additional investigations are
considered necessary at this time.
41TG649
Site 41TG649 (Figure 7, Figure 65, Figure 66) is a very large lithic procurement/lithic quarry site located
across the top of a high ridge system that overlooks the Dove Creek floodplain located about 3 miles to
the northwest. It was recorded along two fencelines running at right angles to each other, and is about
600 m long on an east/west axis and 700 m long on a north/south axis. In all likelihood the site can be
connected between the west and south ends, although final alignment to the east and north did not extend
the site in those directions. Based on observation during the survey the site most likely covers at least 65
acres, but probably targets a seam of chert that is present near the top of the slope (about 2300 amsl). The
site is within the Segovia, and to a lesser extent, Fort Terrett limestone formations. The shallow soils are
mapped as Tarrant association which support sparse grass and relatively dense juniper where land
clearing has not taken place. Minor drainages originate along the ridgeline and feed an unnamed tributary
to Dove Creek.

57

Observed artifacts consisted of
many thousands of large flakes
and tested pieces of mostly
tabular chert that was gray to
brown in color.
In areas
downslope, to the south and west,
flakes were smaller and thinner
than in the main outcrop.
Especially to the south, some
smaller, relatively discrete scatters
had the appearance of minor
workshops. A fragmentary dart
point, most likely a Darl, was seen
on the hill crest. The entire site
within the ROW had been heavily
impacted by past clearing
activities.
Upturned limestone
blocks were common, and the soil
was obviously quite shallow. For
this reason no subsurface tests
were attempted.
This site
compares favorably with other
lithic procurement sites recorded
on the south end of the project
area.
The Segovia formation
produces both nodular and tabular
chert, and it is typically of high
quality. At 41TG649, there was
still viable raw material available
for primary reduction.
Figure 65. Site 41TG649.

Site 41TG649 is a very large,
intensively used lithic procurement site.
Within the ROW it has been heavily disturbed
by past clearing.
Although it provides
locational information useful for settlement
patterning and landscape analyses, the site
itself has little additional research value and it
is considered fully investigated within and
immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW,
and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal
listings.

measures are considered necessary.

41TG650
Site 41TG650 (Figure 9, Figure
67) is a 900 m-long open
camp/lithic scatter located across
the Bois D’Arc Draw drainage
very near the southern edge of
Tom Green County. It is within
Holocene
alluvium
(Qal
formation) holding several soils,
including Dev and Rio Concho,
Tarrant association, Angelo silty
clay and Cho association. Where
the vegetation has not been
cleared it consists of juniper and
mesquite woods with prickly pear
and tassajillo (Figure 68). The
western portion of the site is a
sandy and rocky bench or ledge
above the floodplain.
The
vegetation here is much denser,
but is mostly juniper and
mesquite. Visibility was generally excellent, although soil
depth varied considerably.
Observed artifacts consisted of
numerous flakes, several tools,
including a spoke shave, unifaces,
a Bulverde/Bell/Andice stem
(Figure 69), and scattered burned
limestone. On the western, higher

portion of the site, there were a
greater number of tools as well, with more
cores present, as well as about 10 thin
bifaces, at least two of which were probably
medial sections of dart points, a well-made
knife, a graver and a “bifacial uniface.”
Fifteen subsurface tests (T-175-T-189) were
excavated within the site, all within the
lower, floodplain portion (the western
portion of the site was clearly within
deflated, pale yellowish-brown silts). Of the
fifteen tests, only five were positive for
cultural material, which typically consisted
of a few fragmentary pieces of chert. Soil
profiles were brownish silt or clay loams
which typically encountered limestone
gravels or cobbles at depths between 20 and

Figure 69. Projectile
at 41TG650.

Site 41TG650 is a diffuse open camp located mostly on a low floodplain. The
base of the slope to the west, prior to the rise in elevation, had recent flood
debris present, indicating the higher elevation is less prone to flooding (i.e., a
more desirable camping location). Like many of the other campsites (e.g
41TG636), it is near to lithic procurement sites, is widely scattered, and lacks
identifiable features and integrity of vertical deposits. The site therefore has
little additional research value and it is considered fully investigated within and
immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW, and is not felt to be eligible for
state or federal listings. No further work or avoidance measures are considered
necessary.

41TG651
Site 41TG651 (Figure 9, see Figure 34) is a
550 m-long lithic procurement site located
immediately
east
of
41TG650
and
immediately west of 41TG636. It is along the
crest and slopes of a hill within the Segovia
limestone formation that is covered by
shallow Tarrant association soils.
The
surrounding vegetation is mostly grass, shrubs
and juniper, although the fenceline that the
ROW will parallel has been aggressively
cleared, with widespread and extreme
disturbance.
Despite this, there numerous extremely dense
clusters of cores, flakes, early stage bifaces

and tested pieces of tabular and nodular chert,
both of which are present here, mostly a light
brown to caramel color, and resting upon the surface, either eroded from the surrounding limestone or still
partially embedded. There are certainly tens of thousands, and quite probably hundreds of thousands of
artifacts, although the vast majority is fairly small in size, suggesting this site was almost exhausted. Due
to the excellent visibility, obvious shallow soils, and degree of past disturbance, no shovel tests were
attempted.
Despite the impressive nature of this site, it has been heavily impacted by broad-scale clearing activities,
and lacks the type of data that can be used to effectively address specific research questions. The site,
therefore, is useful for settlement patterning and landscape scale studies, but has little additional research
value and it is considered fully investigated within and immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW, and
is not felt to be eligible for state or federal listings. No further work or avoidance measures are
considered necessary.
41TG652
Site 41TG652 (Figure 7, Figure 71) is a 425 m-long lithic procurement site located on the crest and slopes
of a low hill overlooking portions of the Burks Creek drainage. It is within Segovia formation limestone
covered with Tarrant formation soils that support scattered and scattered mottes of juniper and oak trees.
The entire area has been heavily impacted by past clearing activities.
The site was less dense than some other lithic procurement sites that were recorded during the project, but
still had numerous flakes, cores and early stage bifaces. The material was almost exclusively tabular,
with a light orange limestone cortex. The thin tabs were of high quality, very knappable chert.
60

Additionally, there was a fairly
large amount of unmodified tabs
present, indicating this site was still
a useful locale for procurement of
raw lithic material. Due to the
obvious shallow soils, excellent
visibility, and level of past
disturbance, no shovel tests were
attempted.
Site 41TG652 is a lithic
procurement site that corresponds
well with other recorded during the
survey.
Although it provides
certain high level information, it
lacks detailed types of data useful
for addressing specific research
goals.
The site is therefore
considered fully investigated within
and immediately adjacent to the
proposed ROW, and is not felt to be
eligible for state or federal listings.
No further work or avoidance
measures are considered necessary.
41TG653
Site 41TG653 (Figure 7, Figure 72)
is a 50 m-diameter lithic scatter
with a possible burned rock
concentration located near a minor
stream confluence that is part of the

Burks Creek drainage system. It is
within the Segovia limestone
formation, although not too far distant from a tongue of Holocene alluvium. Soils are mapped as Angelo
silty clay. The area has been cleared, but not as intensively as in some other locations, and established
grass is present, as well as oak trees growing along the drainage (Figure 73).
Observed artifacts consisted of about 20 cores, several flakes of all classes, a well-made formal uniface,
about four thick bifaces and three thin bifaces. Outside the site, on the hillslope to the south, was a purple
quartzite hammerstone. An apparent burned rock feature was located just east of the main artifact scatter.
It was about 15 m in diameter but lacked depth. There were no clearly associated artifacts. Two shovel
tests (T-200, T-203) were placed within this feature. Soils were shallow, and consisted of brownish clay
loam over gravelly clay loams. Test T-200 had one chert flake in the upper 20 cm. Tests T-201 and T202 were placed within the main artifact scatter. Test T-202 had a thin biface fragment, two burned chert
chunks and one small burned rock. The other test was negative. Profiles were of very shallow soils over
limestone. Three tests (T-205-T-205) were placed across the creek to the north. These were all negative
and encountered bedrock or gravels at depths not exceeding 25 cm.
At site 41TG653 there is a moderate amount of chert artifacts across the surface, and a possible burned
rock feature. The feature has no identifiable structure or depth, no organic material, and cannot be
conclusively assigned as prehistoric in age. The site is therefore considered fully investigated within and
61

immediately adjacent to the
proposed ROW, and is not felt to
be eligible for state or federal
listings.
No further work or
avoidance
measures
are
considered necessary.
41TG654
Site 41TG654 ((Figure 7, Figure
74) is a 1400 m-long lithic scatter
with burned rock and tools located
along a minor tributary to the
Burks Creek drainage system. It
is within the Segovia limestone
formation that is covered by
Angelo silty clay and Tarrant
formation soils, with Tarrant soils
predominant on the slopes and the
Angelo soils present near the
stream channel.
Vegetation
consists of variable amounts of
grass, shrubs and cacti along with
mesquite, juniper and oak. The
area has obviously been cleared in
the past, but disturbances are
much less severe than in some
other portions of the project area.
The site consists of a diffuse
scatter of a few cores, several
dozens of flakes, about 10 thick

bifaces, four thin bifaces a few
flake tools and informal unifaces,
and scattered burned limestone.
There were no significant increases in material
in any one location, except perhaps at about
the site center, where there was a slight
increase in lithic material. The burned rock
was not seen to be present in any
concentrations or noticeable patterning, in
other words, no features were seen. A total of
ten shovel tests (T-190-T-199) was placed
within the site. Of these, six were positive for
cultural material. The recovery consisted of
minimal amounts of lithic debitage, almost all
within the upper 20 cm of soil. Soil profiles
consisted of clay loams giving way to very
dense clay or clay loams, or in some cases,
gravels or bedrock. Examination of stream

62

Site 41TG654 is representative of
minor,
ephemeral
campsites
located within valleys along small
streams, often near large lithic
procurement sources. Any oncesurficial intact features have been
disrupted by decades of ranching
activities. There are no diagnostic
tools, organic remains, features, or
evidence of buried components.
The site is therefore considered
fully investigated within and
immediately adjacent to the
proposed ROW, and is not felt to
be eligible for state or federal
listings.
No further work or
avoidance measures are considered
necessary.
41TG655
Site 41TG655 (Figure 9, Figure
75) is a 180 m-long lithic scatter
with burned rock located near the
head of a small drainage that feeds
the Bois D’Arc Draw drainage a
short distance to the south. It is
within caliche and gravel deposits
bordering an area of Holocene
alluvium. Soils are mapped as the

established oak trees. The site is
at the location of a water windmill and stock tank, indicating a supply of groundwater at this location.
Clearing was minimal at this specific location.
Observed artifacts consisted of 12-15 cores, most of which were on the north side of the creek, about 30
flakes, four flake tools or unifaces, three thick bifaces and two thin bifaces. There were also two surficial
clusters of burned limestone, both near the primary artifact scatter in the southern portion of the site.
Both lacked sufficient integrity to be considered as intact features, although both were about 3 m in
diameter, with one containing 25 fairly large rocks and the other with about 100 smaller rocks. Three
subsurface tests (T-231-T-233) were excavated within the site; two on the southern end near the main
artifact and burned rock scatters and the other north of the creek along the sloping base of the hill to that
direction (Figure 76). There was no recovery in any of these. Soil profiles ranged from 20 cm of loam to
bedrock to brown clay or loamy clay to depths of 90-100 cm.
Site 41TG655 may once have had some level of useful data, however, decades of ranching activities have
severely compromised any such potential. There is no depth to the site, and it lacks diagnostic artifacts or
organic material. The site is therefore considered fully investigated within and immediately adjacent to
the proposed ROW, and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal listings. No further work or avoidance
measures are considered necessary.
63

41TG656
Site 41TG656 (Figure 9, Figure
77) is a 300 m-long lithic
procurement site located on a
hilltop overlooking the Bois
D’Arc Draw drainage system to
the south. It is within Segovia
formation limestone covered by
Tarrant series soils supporting
scattered brush and grass and
numerous oak trees. The area has
been aggressively cleared of
juniper in the recent past, which
has resulted in excellent visibility
of shallow soils among overturned
limestone bedrock boulders.
This is another extraordinarily
dense accumulation of chert from
naturally occurring nodules and
tabs within the Segovia formation.
Most of the material originates
from root beer-colored nodules,
although lighter brown tabular
chert with a reddish cortex is also
present, apparently as an ancient
lag deposit. No intact nodules or
chert veins were seen. Observed
artifacts consisted of almost
certainly millions of flakes, cores,
tested nodules and tabs, in some

cases making up extremely dense
clusters (Figure 78). There were very few
bifaces, and no tools were seen. Due to
excellent visibility in highly disturbed,
obviously shallow soils, no shovel tests were
attempted.
Site 41TG656 is the densest of several dense
lithic procurement sites recorded during this
project. As such it is useful for settlement
pattering and landscape level analyses, but
lacks specific levels of research potential that
could realistically be used to answer specific
research questions. The site is therefore
considered fully investigated within and
immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW,
and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal
listings.
No further work or avoidance
measures are considered necessary.

41TG657
Site 41TG657 (Figure 8, Figure
79) is a 180 m-long moderately
dense lithic scatter located on
either side of Burks Creek about
700 m north of petroglyph site
41TG640. It is within Holocene
alluvium (Qal formation) in Dev
and Rioconcho and Angelo silty
loam soils supporting scattered
grasses and low shrubs with large
oak trees near the stream channel.
The surrounding land has been
cleared, but not recently, and is
used primarily as goat and cattle
pasture.
The site was recorded due to a
proposed
reroute
of
the
transmission line that was later
taken out of consideration.
Observed artifacts consisted of a
light scatter of flakes on both
sides of the creek, while on the
north (high) side of the creek were
seen a few tools and scattered
burned
limestone.
Nine
subsurface tests (T-244-T-248, T252-T-255) were excavated within
the site. Five of these tests were
positive for cultural material,

which consisted of minimal
amount of lithic debitage and/or burned
limestone, mostly in the upper 20 cm of soil.
Profiles were recorded as brownish clay loams
that typically encountered limestone gravels at
depth.
Site 41TG657 is another example of an
ephemeral campsite location along a valley
stream channel that was frequently
encountered during this project. It has very
little research value beyond that already
gathered by its recording. The site is therefore
considered fully investigated within and
immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW,
and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal

No further work or avoidance
measures
are
considered
necessary.
Additionally, the proposed reroute has been withdrawn from consideration and there are no projectrelated impacts to the site proposed at this time.
65

41TG658
Site 41TG658 (Figure 7, Figure
80) is a 650 m-long lithic
procurement site located across a
rolling ridge system between two
right bank tributaries of Dove
Creek.
It is within Segovia
formation limestone covered by
Tarrant series soils supporting a
generally open grass and cacti
environment, with some areas of
fairly dense juniper. The recent
intense clearing seen at other
locations along the project area
was not apparent here, although
clearing had obviously taken place
in the past, and exposed bedrock
was common within the shallow
soils.
Observed material consisted of
numerous large flakes and cores
within both nodular and tabular
chert exposures. This site is about
mid-scale (or less) in intensity,
with artifacts common but not
especially dense. The site was
noted during reconnaissance of a
proposed reroute, but not formally
recorded at that time. Due to the
obviously shallow soils, excellent

visibility with exposed bedrock,
and levels of past disturbance, no shovel tests were attempted. The reroute has since been established as
crossing this site, however, given what is known about procurement sites recorded elsewhere during this
project, a revisit was not considered necessary.
Site 41TG658 is a relatively minor lithic procurement site that has little research potential beyond that
already gathered. The site is therefore considered fully investigated within and immediately adjacent to
the proposed ROW, and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal listings. No further work or avoidance
measures are considered necessary.
41TG660
Site 41TG660 (41TG659 was not assigned to this project) is an 80 m-long open campsite/burned rock
midden located on the north bank of Burks Creek about 280 m north of petroglyph site 41TG640 (Figure
8, Figure 82). It is within mapped Holocene alluvial deposits (Qal formation) with Angelo silty clay soils
supporting sparsely vegetated pasture with oak trees present along the stream channel.
The site was recorded during examination of a slight reroute that resulted in the avoidance of 41TG640.
The site was discovered due to shovel testing and the presence of three small mounded areas, each
66

covered by scattered burned
limestone. A moderate amount of
lithic debitage, about 40 flakes,
five flake tools, a uniface, two
thick bifaces, a thin biface and
core were noted, most of these
across a low swale that separates
the midden from an exposed, more
rocky slope to the northwest.
The burned rock feature(s) are
composed of three distinct, low
mounded areas containing clusters
of burned rock (Figure 81).
Shovel testing indicates these are
connected by burned rock scatter
below the surface. Cluster 1 is 2
m in diameter with about 50 rocks.
Cluster 2 is 15 m south of Cluster
1 and 3 m in diameter and has
about 40 rocks, it is highly
disrupted.
Cluster 3 is very
similar to Cluster 2, and is about 7
m southwest of it. There is also a
burned rock scatter near Cluster 3.
Very minor amounts of lithic
debitage are present in this area.
The apparent BRM is about 20 m
in diameter.
Figure 80. Site 41TG658.
Site 41TG660 appears to contain
three small oven features that were
used enough times to create a small midden. There is surficial disturbance but the subsurface may be
largely intact. No organic material was observed during shovel testing, and there is a minimal amount of
other artifacts. Its proximity to 41TG640, with mortar holes, petroglyphs and a burned rock midden
elevates the potential significance of this site through association. Additional testing may show that
determining formation process is possible. If organic material or other artifacts are present then
additional useful information may also be available. This site is not considered to be fully investigated,
and is therefore potentially eligible for formal state or federal listings. Its location has been
communicated to project engineers, and full avoidance is planned for the midden portion of the site. No
clearing or vehicular movement will be necessary there. If, however, avoidance becomes impossible,
then testing designed to determine eligibility for SAL and/or NRHP should be considered, with mitigation
efforts possibly becoming necessary depending upon the outcome of the testing.

41SL30
Site 41SL30 (Figure 10, Figure 83) is a 300 m-long upland lithic scatter located across a high ridge which
overlooks tributaries of the South Concho River to the south and north. Soils are mapped as Tarrant
series over Segovia formation limestone. Vegetation consists of open woods with scattered Live Oaks,
juniper, agarita and prickly pear. Visibility was excellent with obviously shallow soils pocketed within
limestone bedrock.

67

This is a fairly dense and extensive
site on a high point of the
prominent ridge. Biface production
was probably the major activity
using distinctive dark gray chert
apparently brought to the site from
nearby sources. Three of the four
projectile
points
discovered,
although fragmentary, appear to be
Early
Archaic
or
possibly
Paleoindian.
One has edge
grinding and a concave base, the
other two are long and narrow and
have parallel flaking and all three
lack distinct stems. The fourth
point has fairly wide body and a
small stem with flaring ears (Figure
84). Also noted were about 10 thin
bifaces, more than 20 thick bifaces,
around 10 unifaces, and scores of
flakes.
Burned rock might be
present in small amounts. The soils
are shallow and buried deposits are
extremely unlikely (Figure 85). No
features or clear patterning of
artifacts was noted but the densest
material seemed to occur on the
highest part of the site. No shovel
tests were excavated due to the
obvious shallow soils and exposed

bedrock. Although brush clearing
was not as extreme here as in other portions of
the project area, it has almost certainly
occurred in the past. Additionally, the site is
along a property boundary that is bordered by a
recently constructed high gamefence.
Site 41SL30 is an upland lithic scatter that is
considered fully investigated within and
immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW,
and is not felt to be eligible for state or federal
listings.
No further work or avoidance
measures are considered necessary.

Other Areas
South Terrace of the Concho River
The south side of the Middle Concho River consists of about 380 m
of Holocene Qal formation holding Rioconcho/Spur soils before the
terrace begins rising to an earlier undivided Quaternary deposit with
Tulia and Angelo soils. Five shovel tests (T015, T017, T018, T019,
T020), were placed across this landform (Figure 3). The two nearest
the river encountered grayish-brown to dark grayish brown clay to
silt loam at depths up to 100 cm. In T-015 a pebble and carbonate
zone was encountered at 35 cm, below which was a very hard
packed brown clay. Proceeding southward, away from the river, the
pebble and carbonate zone was found to be present at depths of 60
cm then rising to 40 and then 20. Geotechnical bore B-11, was
drilled very near the southern edge of the Qal terrace (Terracon
2010). The profile description for the bore consisted “stiff clay” to a
depth of 7 m, at which point “weak rock” was encountered. Given
the complete lack of surficial or buried cultural materials, the
decreasing depth of the pebble and carbonate zone across the terrace,
69

Figure 84. Bifaces from 41SL30.

the geotechnical data, and the overall low probability of the terrace as seen in the field (Figure 86), it is
felt that this terrace has been adequately investigated.
South Terrace of Spring Creek
The south terrace of Spring Creek is an
approximate 560 m-wide floodplain
consisting of Rioconcho/Spur soils.
Except for the extreme northern edge of
the terrace, the land form is presently
used as an agricultural field. A total of
18 shovel and auger tests (T-032-T-039,
T-174, T-207-T-215) was excavated in
this area (Figure 5). Six tests contained
cultural material. The positive tests
contained minimal amounts of mussel
shell fragments, as well as a chip and
flake fragment in two separate tests.
Soils were generally grayish brown clay
loam, brown loamy clays, and dense

brown clays or yellowish brown clays,
with carbonates increasing with depth.
Due to the dense soils the majority of the tests were excavated by mechanical auger, allowing consistent
testing to depths of 100-140 cm (Figure 87). The only anomaly encountered was immediately south of
the creek, where a gravel bed was encountered. Tests T-033 and T-210 were excavated in this feature.
The gravels were at least 80 cm thick, and although one chip was encountered (T-210), there is no
evidence that there are intact deposits here. Tests on either side of the gravel bar confirmed this. Given
the minimal amount of cultural material seen on the surface and within the subsurface tests, it is felt that
the terrace has been adequately investigated.
Bois d’Arc Draw Floodplain (N)
Between McGregor Road and site 41TG638 is a broad, 400-600 m-wide, heavily cleared pasture mapped
as Holocene alluvium with Tobosa clay soils. Eight subsurface tests (T-236-243) were excavated in this
area (Figure 9). Test T-237 was positive for possible cultural material, a piece of chert shatter (Figure
88). Given the level of testing that indicated gray to brown clay loams of brown clay resting on pale
caliche silts, this pasture is considered to be fully investigated.
Bois d’Arc Draw Floodplain (S)
Immediately north of Duff Road, on the north/south alignment of the corridor is an area of Tobosa and
Dev and Rioconcho soils within a Qal formation. Prehistoric site 41TG650 was recorded on the east/west
portion of the line, just to the south. Ten shovel tests (T-065-T-068, T-216-T-221) were excavated across
this portion area. All were negative for cultural material (Figure 9). The entire field was heavily
disturbed from previous clearing activities (Figure 89). Two or three widely scattered cores were
observed in the general vicinity. Given the nature of previous disturbance, the excellent visibility, and the
negative results of subsurface testing it is felt this portion of the project area has been adequately
documented. The final alignment was shifted eastward in this area, but given the highly disturbed nature
of the pasture coupled with the negative results of the ten subsurface tests no additional investigations are
considered necessary.

70

Tankersley RR Crossing
According to Joe Collins, present owner of the Tankersley Ranch complex, the railroad crossing situated
within the “Y” formed by Hwy 67 and Hwy 2335 once contained livestock loading facilities and several
bars (Figure 5). The ROW was closely examined and shovel tested (T-069-T-071) in this area (Figure
90). There was an extremely light scatter of historic materials (a couple of rusted cans, a glass fragment)
that was not recorded as a site, and there was no evidence of any structural remains. This area is
considered to be fully investigated.
Reroute north of Duncan Road
A small drainage system was examined along the original proposed route (Figure 4). Seven subsurface
tests (T-116-T-122) were excavated in this area, with no recovery in brown silt loams over brown clays
often encountering carbonates and pebbles at depths below 35-60 cm (Figure 91). Numerous gullies
showed no evidence of cultural materials. The final alignment was shifted about 40 m west in this area.
The previous work demonstrated that this was a low probability area for cultural material, so no
additional investigations were attempted here.
Dove Creek (Cauble, Tweedy, Rathbone) Reroute
Following completion and review by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) of the original survey
report it was learned that there was a relatively substantial 3.8 mi-long reroute needed for the eastern side
of Dove Creek (Figure 8). The reroute moved the alignment east, away from the present creek channel,
although approximately 0.8 miles was still within the alluvial Holocene terrace, while the remainder
crossed older undivided Quaternary and Cretaceous Fort Terrett formations to the south, and the final 2
miles closely paralleling the previously surveyed route. The principal area of interest was within the
Dove Creek floodplain, where the reroute crossed Rioconcho/Spur and then Angelo silty clay loam soils.
One other area considered to be of moderate probability for containing cultural resources was along a
meandering stream south of Guinn Road. This area was spot checked, and given the shallow soils and
excellent visibility, no subsurface tests were excavated.
The 0.8 miles that was intensively investigated is within an agricultural terrace that had been recently
plowed. Investigations consisted of a pedestrian survey along with mechanical augering and backhoe
trenching. Ten auger tests and eight backhoe trenches were excavated, exceeding the minimum number
of subsurface tests suggested by state survey standards (Figure 92).
Additional cultural resource investigations were conducted between May 10 and 12, 2011, by LCRA and
contracted archaeologists. The investigations consisted of subsurface testing of the Dove Creek
floodplain by mechanical means. A combined total of 18 subsurface tests failed to find any buried
artifacts. Although pedestrian survey encountered scattered surficial artifacts, primarily lithic debitage
and fire-cracked limestone, they were never seen in concentrations warranting site designation, and are
almost certainly the result of decades of plowing redistributing artifacts from the sites that are along Dove
Creek.
Because the 10 auger tests were all screened and indicated a very low probability for buried artifacts in
the upper 140 cm of soil, the backhoe trenches were designed to better understand the geomorphology of
the floodplain terrace, especially in regards to the depth of the terrace and the potential for buried soils.
Backdirt was examined but no test columns were excavated. Each trench was excavated to a depth of 5
ft, and a profile was recorded. Each trench was then excavated to a depth of approximately 2 m or to
bedded gravels. Observations were made for the deeper levels by examining the matrix removed by the
backhoe.
In general, the backhoe trenches uncovered grayish-brown to gray silty topsoils over brown to yellowish
brown loamy or clayey brown subsoils. Each trench encountered a distinct zone of dense carbonates,
71

typically between 50 and 70 cm below the ground surface, and 30 to 50 cm thick (Figure 93). Below the
carbonate zone soils would become increasingly silty and pale, often including rounded limestone and
chert cobbles at depth.
Backhoe trench 6 was an exception to the yellowish brown silty loams. This trench, located on the edge
of a small mapped stream that is little more than a swale within the agricultural field, contained an
extremely dense brown clay, although still with carbonates between 60 and 100 cm. However, at a depth
of 160 cm the brown clay became a light brown silt, and cobbles were found near 200 cm below the
surface. Backhoe trench 7, placed across the swale from BHT 6, provided evidence of specific stream
events, with a 10 cm thick zone of poorly sorted pebbles at 80 cm, a well-sorted 10 cm thick zone of very
fine pebbles between 80 and 90 cm lying above very pale yellowish brown silt with cemented gravels.
These gravel zones were directly below a 30 cm thick zone of pale yellowish brown silt with carbonates.
Backhoe trench 8 also differed in that carbonate zone was at 120 cm, below a brown clay that may have
formed through illuvial processes. In total, the backhoe trenches demonstrate that there is little to no
likelihood for buried soil horizons along this portion of Dove Creek.
Beginning about 500 m south of the edge of the alluvial terrace, the rerouted portion of the line runs for
about 1,000 m parallel to and across a minor tributary stream (see Figure 8). This was considered to be a
moderate probability area and was assessed by pedestrian survey. The area was seen to be moderately to
heavily disturbed by brush clearing, with excellent visibility in thin soils over limestone bedrock. No
shovel tests were excavated, and no sites were recorded.
As a result of the reroute, sites 41TG634, 41TG646, 41TG647, 41TG648 and 41TG658 will no longer be
impacted by the project. Only 41TG648, a single buried burned rock feature, had been recommended for
avoidance. Site 41TG645, a shallow open camp recorded within the original construction easement will
now be within the permanent ROW, however it was not considered to be eligible for formal state or
federal listings, and those interpretations have not changed. Burned rock midden site 41TG642 is still
recommended for impact minimization during construction.
41TG278
As discussed in the Previous Investigations section, the All American Pipeline project recorded site
41TG278 a bit south of newly recorded sites 41TG640, 41TG657 and 41TG660, near Burks Creek on the
Cold Creek Spring USGS quad (Error! Reference source not found.). It was described as a lithic
procurement area that was “located on a hill, through a valley and up a hill to another valley.” The site
was considered ineligible for formal state or federal listings. The present project crosses the western
portion of this site, where a light scatter of lithic material was observed. Given the nature of the site and
its deposits, along with the previous recommendations, it was not formally reinvestigated.
Access Roads and Pulling Easements
As of the date of this report all off-ROW access roads will be using existing ranch roads with little or no
modification. The only exception is at 41TG660, where the access road will cross Burks Creek just north
of the ROW, then cross at an angle back into the ROW, re-entering it north of the avoidance area of that
site. This area was inspected during the recording of 41TG660, with excellent exposure in the creek bank
and other exposures. There are no conflicts with cultural resources at this location.
Where ever the transmission line turns more than 20 degrees, there is the potential for construction
easements on the tangents of those angles. All such pulling easements, when within high probability
areas or adjacent to archaeological sites were examined in the field. These are reported upon in the
individual site descriptions. The only exception is the right angle turn on the west side of Dove Creek
(see Figure 6) where site 41TG632, considered to be ineligible, is located. Due to landowner concerns to
the south and the west, the line will constructed without pulling easements at this location.

Discussion
Linear surveys of the type conducted here provide an opportunity to sample an area based on criteria that
are not related to archaeological questions. In other words, the sample is dictated by other concerns - in
this case the need to construct a transmission line - resulting in a survey transect that is arbitrarily laid out
with respect to cultural resources. Then, by applying predictive modeling (high probability areas) based
on knowledge of the region in question, the locations of certain types of archaeological sites can be
anticipated and tested (Banning 2002:138). The required survey transects are actually quadrats (Drennan
1996: 244), and so invite themselves for various types of statistical comparisons. Although detailed
comparisons are not offered here, the gathered data do provide an opportunity to provide generalized
comments on aspects of past settlement.
The present survey project was designed with certain expectations regarding the potential locations for
archaeological sites. Historic period archaeological sites were expected to be rare, given the late
settlement of the region. Prehistoric campsites, which typically have the greatest potential to provide data
useful for a greater understanding of past events and human behavior, were expected to be located along
the larger water courses. Smaller camps, potentially more important than larger, mixed assemblage sites,
might be expected along some of the smaller streams. Previous studies in the area (see especially Creel
1978) suggest a local cultural expression seen through placement of camps in upland areas, especially if
close to streams. This may have reached an apex with the purposeful interment of persons on butte edges,
creating sites characterized by piles of rocks (cairns) sometimes placed over prepared slab-lined pits
holding the remains of deceased individuals. For these reasons, waterways and high relief uplands in
proximity to waterways were considered to be high probability areas. Areas distant from streams were
considered to be of low probability for archaeological sites, given what is known about prehistoric
76

settlement in general and reinforced for the area by Creel (1978) and Hurt (1980) among others. Figure
95 shows the distribution of prehistoric site types recorded during this project in relation to the geology of
the region.
Riparian zones largely met with expectations, with campsites present at all the named drainages and
several of the smaller ones. Upland settings close to water were consistently examined for the types of
sites discussed above, as these would clearly be significant. However, no indications of cairns were
found in any locations, This may be due to widespread brush-clearing activities, although it is as
probable that the survey transect simply did not cross any such sites, as some have been recorded in the
area (see Previous Investigations and Site Clusters sections). The uplands did, however, produce a
plethora of lithic procurement sites, of which the size, density, and intensity of use speak to the
importance of stone resources.
Historic site encounters essentially matched predictions. Two homestead locations dated to about the
1890s, and one dated to the 1940s. The irrigation feature at 41TG647 provided the best window into
historic activities through illuminating aspects of the systematic irrigation of farmlands beginning in the
1890s. The systems have long been disabled, and any irrigation now takes place with pivot sprayers,
readily visible in aerial imagery.
Fully 38 percent of the recorded prehistoric sites were considered to be open camps, based on the
presence of burned limestone. Most of these, however, were diffuse scatters with burned rock cooccurring with lithic artifacts. These were sometimes quite large in areal extent, covering entire valleys
along stream channels, but they lacked any discernible patterning or concentrations of artifacts, and, even
after accounting for historic disturbances, were clearly ephemeral in nature. These sites were often found
at locations below lithic procurement sites, and in more than one case had procurement zones on either
side. Because these sites lacked formal tools and identifiable burned rock features, it is hypothesized here
that they were placed specifically to exploit raw stone sources, an example of a logistically-based activity.
Even so, secondary reduction was not a common activity at these camps, because larger flakes or flake
concentrations were not seen, nor were there large numbers of manufacturing failures. Therefore,
according to this model, reduction to a satisfactory state took place in the procurement site itself, after
which the product was transported to other, presumably larger camps.
Larger camps were recorded at the Middle Concho River (41TG628), Spring Creek (41TG630), Dove
Creek (41TG642), and Burks Creek (41TG640, 41TG660), with a borderline camp at Bois D’Arc Draw
(41TG638). Burned rock middens were encountered at Dove Creek and Burks Creek, and possibly
Spring Creek and the Middle Concho River. The midden at Dove Creek (41TG642) was of the classic
domed type, probably representing repetitive cooking activities over a relatively long period of time. On
Burks Creek the midden at 41TG640 was clearly a large oven, and had probably been cleaned out after its
last use, resulting in its crescent shape. Across from 41TG640, still on Burks Creek, was the apparent
incipient midden at 41TG660. This midden appeared to be the result of three distinct cooking features
that had begun to comingle. These two middens, along with the mortar hole and petroglyph complex at
41TG640, belie the present ephemeral nature of the stream. A number of water wells drilled in the
vicinity of the site may explain the present lack of water within the stream, and at minimum indicate
groundwater is present.
Certain characteristics of campsites were seen. These included relatively few bifaces and projectile points
(unifaces seemed more common), an almost complete absence of groundstone, and the presence of
freshwater mussel shell, although never seen in great quantities. Bifaces and projectile points may, of
course, have suffered attrition from historic collectors. However, it was also noted that at lithic
procurement sites there were not great numbers of failed or early stage bifaces, and that when tools were

77

Atlas of Texas.

78

present at such sites, they were almost invariably unifaces. Groundstone is also lacking in other survey
projects, so this is clearly not anomalous. Whatever was processed within mortars, presumably using
wooden pestles, was processed more efficiently than with manos and metates. A recurring theme in the
Concho River valley is the presence of mussel shells, often in large numbers. Within the present survey
transect, mussel shell was clearly a foodstuff, but what role it played in subsistence is hard to determine,
especially given the lack of other faunal remains, due to both limited subsurface testing and lack of
preservation.
It is difficult to find substantial studies on mortar hole sites in Texas. Saner and Hixson (1999) used
ethnographic data suggesting that at depths below 9.5 cm, mortars are no longer efficient processors of
acorns. Deeper mortars are conducive for seed processing when using a pestle that grinds the seeds
against the mortar walls. A repetitive back and forth motion can eventually produce oblong, or boat
shaped mortars. Potter (2006) inventoried mortars at Enchanted Rock State Park and suggested that 59
mortars he recorded could have supported between 500 and 2,000 persons, depending upon what was
processed. Burned rock middens seem often to be associated with mortar features. If the processing of
sotol is accepted as a primary use of these, then grinding of the cooked and dried sotol may also have
been a function of the mortars.
Based on the literature review for this project, the petroglyphs at 41TG640 are the largest such
assemblage recorded in the Concho Valley. A precise count of elements was impossible at the survey
level, and the ones that are present are of low relief, and difficult to separate from natural erosion. So,
while clearly not on a par with Lewis Canyon, where thousands of glyphs are present (Turpin and Eling
2003), they are certainly more substantial than those at nearby San Angelo State Park, which consist of
four petroglyphs in surface sandstone (Cooper and Cooper, 2001). These are described as a star-like
element, a possible zoomorph, another possible zoomorph that can be construed as an equestrian figure,
and two rectangular elements cut into the edge of a rock ledge. Recently, Larry Riemenschneider
recorded site 41TG620, which contains eight burned rock middens, stacked rock cairns, “hundreds” of
mortar holes, and at least one petroglyph (a concentric circle set). This site is on a small tributary of Dove
Creek, across a ridge and about 5 miles southwest of 41TG640. It is possible more petroglyphs are
present at this site (Larry Riemenschneider, personal communication 2010).
At Lewis Canyon two petroglyph styles have been recognized, one characterized by curvilinear lines
creating abstract motifs, and often accompanied by atlatl symbols, referred to as the Lower Pecos
Serpentine Style (RAF 2010). A later style is described as the Lower Pecos Discrete Geometric Style,
and is characterized by seemingly randomly oriented geometric and curvilinear designs. Without
conducting a full and detailed comparison, the petroglyphs at 41TG640 seem similar to the Serpentine
Style.
Solveig Turpin has identified a very strong correlation between bedrock mortar features (and/or natural
holes) and bedrock petroglyphs (Solveig Turpin, personal communication 2010). On the western
Edwards Plateau she noted similarities between seven such sites. They were all remote from permanent
water, but had natural cavities that could hold rain water. The sites all had burned rock features indicating
procurement and/or processing activities. Turpin recognized three categories of petroglyphs that
consisted of meandering lines, discrete geometrics, and representational motifs including animal tracks.
The association of animal tracks and what Turpin calls casual water resources led her to suggest hunting
magic was at least one reason the art was produced (Turpin 1992).
Site 41TG640 has a single, small tinaja (see Figure 47) that is enhanced, perhaps, with a single mortar
hole. In total there are 23 mortars present. Eleven are between 2 and 9 cm deep, five are between 10 and
19 cm deep, and seven are between 20 and 31 cm deep. The shallower mortars average about 10 cm in
diameter, the middle range about 15 cm in diameter, and the deeper ones about 20 cm in diameter. There
79

is clearly abstract and representational art present (Figure 42, Figure 96), and at least two burned rock
middens in the immediate vicinity. Atlatl symbols and hoof prints support the hunting magic hypothesis.
The mortar holes are obviously of human construction, and the numerous cupules indicate differing levels
or types of processing. A very rough combined average of mortar hole volume totals approximately 25
gallons, perhaps a useful number if storage may have been a function. See Appendix 1 for mortar hole
metrics from 41TG640.
Lithic scatters comprised 35 percent of the total prehistoric site components, with a count of 12. Lithic
scatters are notoriously difficult to interpret, typically consisting of chert debitage and perhaps a few stone
tools, often in remote or isolated settings. During this project, these types of sites were often encountered
along minor stream channels, and were similar in many respects to the smaller campsites in these same
settings, other than the presence of burned rock. They were often relatively close to campsites. In
general, these types of sites most likely represent short term resource acquisition or processing stations, or
possibly just movement across the terrain.
The third category of prehistoric
site was the lithic procurement site
or locale. There were nine of
these
sites
(not
counting
41TG278), making up 27 percent
of the total. The vast majority of
these sites were in the Segovia
limestone formation, which was
predominant in the southern half
of the project area. These sites
were often massive in size and
scale of utilization, and focused on
typically high quality tabular and
nodular chert, exposed both as
erosional lag deposits and
embedded within limestone. Other
recorders of such sites have made
similar observations. Of the two
procurement sites in the northern
portion of the project area, one
was in an apparent unmapped
exposure of Edwards group
limestone, and the other was
within Quaternary gravel deposits,
and neither approached the scale
of use seen to the south.

cupules or shallow mortars.

The greatest density of sites was at
Dove Creek, and there were more
sites overall in the southern
portion of the project area. The
northern portion of the project is
fairly representative of the “Flats”
environment described by Creel
(1978),
and
supports
his
observations of few sites in such

environments. Other than at Dove Creek, it can be observed that camp sites are located near procurement
sites. A greater abundance of high quality raw material for stone tool production appears to have been at
least one factor in determining where prehistoric people chose to settle.

Summary and Recommendations
A cultural sites survey for archaeological resources was conducted by LCRA Cultural Resources staff and
contracted archaeologists between August, 2010 and February, 2011. Modifications to the originally
proposed 38.35 mi-long line added approximately 14 mi of additional routing or potential routing
requiring assessment, either from the desktop or in the field. (The final alignment is approximately 37.79
mi in length.) As a result, approximately 52.35 mi of line was ultimately assessed. Of that 52.35 mi,
15.50 mi (29.6 percent) was considered to have areas of high probability for cultural resources potentially
eligible for state (SAL) or federal (NRHP) listings. A total of 284 subsurface tests was excavated, an
average of 18 tests per mile of high probability area. This exceeds the minimum survey standards for
linear projects with a 100 ft-wide ROW.
As a result of the investigations, 35 previously undocumented archaeological sites were recorded, one
previously recorded site (41TG577) was reassessed, and one previously recorded site (41TG278) was
revisited, but not reassessed. Of the 36 total assessed sites, five (41TG630, 41TG640, 41TG642,
41TG648, 41TG660) are recommended for some level of avoidance. These sites are all prehistoric and
consist of an open terrace camp site, a petroglyph/mortar hole/burned rock midden site, a large burned
rock midden site, a buried burned rock feature, and a small, incipient burned rock midden site,
respectively.
The remainder of the sites are all assessed as lacking research potential and/or integrity that could make
them eligible or potentially eligible for formal state or federal listings. Prehistorically, these included
primarily lithic scatters and lithic procurement sites, as well as lithic scatters with burned (fire-cracked)
rock – also called open camps, and one deflated open terrace camp. None of the four historic components
were considered to be eligible or potentially eligible for formal state or federal listings. These sites
included a 1940s era standing structure (41TG631), an 1890s era house site (41TG634), a cement slab
postdating original occupation at a house site (41TG635), and a cement box-like structure associated with
irrigation activities (41TG647).
Recommended avoidance measures are as follows:
41TG630 – there will be no transmission structures placed within the site’s boundary. Because the
surface has obviously been disturbed in the past, it is recommended that seppi or hydro-ax type equipment
be allowed to clear as necessary. No bulldozing should be allowed, and no other heavy equipment travel
should occur within the site unless acceptable protective measures, such as the use of wooden mats, are
used.
41TG640 – the transmission line is no longer routed across this site. The site boundaries are known to
project engineers and construction managers, and there will no stream crossings or any type of access or
vehicular movement through this site.
41TG642 – no transmission structures will be placed within the site’s boundaries. A pulling easement has
been adjusted so that will not impact the site. Because the site has been previously cleared by machinery,
it is recommended that seppi or hydro-ax type equipment be allowed to clear as necessary. No bulldozing
should be allowed, and no other heavy equipment travel should occur within the site unless acceptable
protective measures, such as the use of wooden mats, are used.

81

41TG648 – this site is no longer crossed by the proposed transmission line.
41TG660 – the location of this site is known to project engineers and no structures will be placed at its
location. No clearing is necessary here, and any vehicular traffic may use the eastern portion of the ROW
as necessary. The boundaries of this site will be marked during construction to ensure avoidance.
41TG647 – this site is no longer crossed by the proposed transmission line.
If the avoidance measures described above cannot be accomplished, then possible additional testing
and/or mitigation will be discussed with the Texas Historical Commission.
It is recommended that the project be allowed to proceed in all other areas without additional cultural
resource investigations or restrictions. If, however, unexpected buried cultural materials are encountered,
than work at that immediate location will be halted until the find can be assessed and reported to the
Texas Historical Commission for consideration of any additional investigations.

I. INTRODUCTION
This report presents the findings of a reconnaissance‐level survey of potential visual impacts to
nonarcheological historic resources for the proposed Twin Buttes‐McCamey D 345‐kV transmission
line in Tom Green and Schleicher counties, Texas. The final alignment for this project has not yet
been established, and the project includes several possible reroutes along the proposed alignment
(Figure 1). This document presents the results of the survey and provides National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility and visual effect assessments for all historic‐age resources
identified within the area of potential effect (APE) in the survey effort for the proposed project,
including proposed reroutes. Additionally, this report presents the results of historic map and
aerial photography analysis of inaccessible resources within the APE for the primary route and the
possible reroute areas. Finally, the report includes a general historic landscape integrity assessment
for the entire project area based on historic map and aerial photography. The information
presented in this report is intended to satisfy the regulatory requirements set forth in Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended.
The general alignment for the proposed transmission line would begin in northwestern Tom Green
County at the existing Twin Buttes substation, approximately 5 miles north of Farm‐to‐Market Road
(FM) 853, and parallel an existing transmission line south to a point approximately 1.25 miles south
of FM 853. The proposed line then separates from the existing line and trends southwest for
approximately 0.33 mile and then turns south, crossing Spring Creek west of the Knickerbocker
community, then runs parallel to FM 2335 and traverses plowed fields and rangeland. The
proposed line continues its general south‐southeasterly path, crossing Dove Creek, to its
intersection with County Road (CR) 431. South of Dove Creek, the landscape transitions to
rangeland and oil and gas fields, entering Schleicher County, with very few plowed fields or
domestic resources.
Several possible reroutes are still under consideration; however, all of the reroutes in the northern
half of the project are very slight and amount to only minimal shifts in the alignment (see Figure 1).
In the southern portion of the project, between the Tom Green‐Schleicher county line and FM 2335,
the possible reroutes are more significant and include shifts of approximately 2,000 to 2,500 feet
away from the primary alignment.
This report includes a table of recorded resources and property types and a set of resource location
maps (figures 1–4). An appendix includes resource documentation forms for all recorded resources.
The information presented on the forms includes photographic documentation and brief NRHP and
visual impact analysis.

II. METHODS
In September 2010, a team of professionally qualified historians and architectural historians
examined an APE extending 0.5 mile beyond each side of the proposed project’s centerline. The
purpose of the survey was to identify historically significant (NRHP‐listed or ‐eligible) resources
(including buildings, structures, objects, districts, etc.) 50 years of age or older that could be
adversely affected by the construction of the proposed line. For the purposes of this survey,
historians used a 1960 cutoff date for identification of historic‐age resources.
In the field, the historians visually examined all historic‐age resources within the APE that were
visible from the public right of way (ROW) or where permissible access was granted (Figure 1).
Recorded resources were photo‐documented, and their locations were mapped. The documentation
photos, along with limited secondary source historical research, were used to develop NRHP
eligibility and/or visual impact assessments for all recorded resources and to complete the
respective resource documentation forms (Appendix). In areas where permissible access was not
granted, historians compared historic maps and aerial photographs to current aerial photographs
to determine if any historic‐age resources were located on the parcel and if they appeared to retain
their historic setting and form. Subsequent to the 2010 survey effort, several possible reroutes
were added to the project. These reroutes added some additional areas to the project APE (see
Figure 1). Historians used historic maps along with historic and current aerial photography to
identify historic‐age resources within the expanded APE, which were not included in the field
efforts, and within any areas where permissible access was not granted during the original survey
effort. Additionally, historians used these maps and aerial photographs to develop an
understanding of land‐use patterns in the project area over time and to assess the integrity of the
existing landscape.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800, the NRHP eligibility assessments were developed by applying
NRHP eligibility criteria with regard to locally relevant historic development patterns. All resources
recorded within the APE were also assessed for potentially adverse visual impacts. During the
survey efforts, project historians also sought to identify and record any designated or potentially
historic residential and commercial districts within or extending into the APE, but none were
encountered. A brief summary of the characteristics of the various residential/commercial areas,
including eligibility and effect assessments, is included in Chapter III.

HISTORIC BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT AREA
The project area is primarily located in western Tom Green County, with a portion extending south
into the northwest portion of Schleicher County. The project area is geographically located in a
transitional region, with the northern portion of the project landscape having characteristics more
common to the Rolling Plains and the southern portion having characteristics more common to the

100017015/110012

18

II. Methods
Edwards Plateau. The three major water sources crossing the project area include the Middle
Concho River, Dove Creek, and Spring Creek. The project area is located in a primarily rural area
running approximately parallel to and west of U.S. Highway (US) 277.
The area was slow to develop in the nineteenth century due to the presence of Comanche Indians in
the area, which discouraged many Anglos from migrating to the area. By the 1860s, permanent
settlement began at a slow pace with few pioneer ranchers moving to the Concho River Valley. Two
of the earliest settlers to the area were Richard Franklin Tankersley, who established cattle
ranching in the area in 1864, and Ben Ficklin, a stage operator who migrated to the Concho River
Valley in 1865. Despite these early settlement efforts, the project area remained undeveloped open
rangeland though the mid‐1860s. Following the Civil War, the United States built several military
forts across the western frontier to defend the land against the Native American tribes and uphold
the Reconstruction government (Henderson 2011). Fort Concho was established at the juncture of
the Middle and North Concho Rivers in present day San Angelo in 1867. Although Fort Concho was
located beyond the limits of the project area, it served as the regional commercial, social, and
processing hub (Henderson 2011).
Anglo settlement in the area increased slightly in the late 1860s; however, the majority of the area’s
population consisted of migratory buffalo hunters, open‐range cattle ranchers, and those living in
the Fort Concho vicinity, with sparse rural ranch developments. Large‐scale settlement in the area
remained stifled by the continued threat of Native American conflict and the lack of fencing
materials to protect crops and property from open‐range cattle‐ranching operations. In 1865,
tensions between Native Americans and white settlers came to a head in a skirmish between local
militia and Confederate Army forces and a band of Kickapoo Indians passing through the area on
their way to Mexico along Dove Creek. The Confederate and militia forces were defeated by the
Kickapoos in their poorly executed raid on the Native American encampment. Although the
Kickapoo continued their trek to Mexico, the skirmish increased tensions between Native
Americans and Anglos and violence continued between whites and Native Americans in the area
until the early 1870s (Nickels and Mauldin 2001, Prikryl 2011).
Buffalo hunting and open‐range ranching dominated the local economy through the 1870s, with
buffalo hunting reaching its apex between 1874 and 1878, when bad weather drove the buffalo
from the area (Henderson 2011). The introduction of barbed wire in the late 1870s effectively
ended the open‐range practice in Texas, opening the frontier for more‐permanent settlement
(McCallum and Owens 2011). By 1870, the county’s population stood at 1,000, with the vast
majority of the inhabitants living in the Fort Concho vicinity. During this period, the county
encompassed approximately 60,000 square miles (Henderson 2011).
In the 1870s, the closure of the open range and the diminishing threat of Native American attack
brought an increased number of settlers to the Concho River Valley. In 1875, the community of Ben
Ficklin, named after the early settler and stage operator, was selected as the county seat, despite
100017015/110012

19

II. Methods
strong opposition from many who supported designation of San Angelo as the county seat. The
decision to locate the seat of county government in Ben Ficklin seemed to foreshadow the area’s
future development. San Angelo’s supporters included the waning buffalo hunters, soldiers, and
cowboys who thrived on the frontier, while area ranchers, Fort Concho officers, and stage
employees supported Ben Ficklin (Henderson 2011).
The 1870s also witnessed the introduction of sheep into the Concho River Valley with the
establishment of Knickerbocker Ranch on the southeast side of Dove Creek in 1877 (Waring 2011).
Originally founded when Joseph Tweedy and others drove Mexican sheep from Fort Clark in Kinney
County to the area near Fort Concho, Knickerbocker Ranch became the town of Knickerbocker with
a post office in 1881 and 25 residents in 1887 and 1890 (Waring 2011). In the same year that
Tweedy established Knickerbocker Ranch, John Arden arrived in the San Angelo area from
California with his own sheep, contributing to what would later become “an international center of
the wool industry” (Tweedy 2011). Although falling wool prices in the early 1880s significantly
affected these early sheep‐ranching efforts, the introduction of the Santa Fe Railroad in 1888 and
the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railroad in 1909 eventually resulted in making San Angelo and
Tom Green County one of the largest sheep and wool markets in the United States (Duke 2011).
While the county was not the leading sheep county in the region, the railroad made it the market
center. The first wool warehouse was built in San Angelo in 1888, and a second was built shortly
after, and by the turn of the century, over a million pounds of wool per year were shipped from San
Angelo (Henderson 2011).
The sheep and wool industry continued to thrive in the area into the twentieth century. Improved
stock of Rambouillet sheep replaced the crossbreeds that previously dominated the industry
(Henderson 2011). As a result, from 1923 to 1929, exports of wool and mohair increased from 5 to
17 million pounds per year (Henderson 2011). Mohair and wool production remained steady
throughout the remainder of the historic period and San Angelo continues to be one of the leading
inland wool and mohair markets in the nation (Duke 2011).
Similarly, Richard F. Tankersley’s 1864 settlement of Tankersley Ranch represents the initial
establishment of open‐range cattle ranching in the area. As mentioned, 1860s and 1870s open‐
range longhorn cattle ranching ended with the establishment of large private ranches through the
introduction of barbed wire and improved breeds, such as Durham and Hereford cattle, to the area
(Henderson 2011). While 1886 witnessed the most expansive roundup in the history of West Texas,
occurring near Knickerbocker, when 15 "outfits" assembled 25,000 cattle, it was not until after the
1888 establishment of San Angelo as a major shipping point on the Santa Fe Railroad that the cattle
market in Tom Green County gained national significance. By 1900, approximately 3,500 to 5,000
railroad cars of cattle were shipped from Tom Green County annually making San Angelo the
largest range cattle–shipping station in the United States (Henderson 2011). Large‐scale private
cattle, sheep, and goat ranches replaced smaller ranches beginning in the 1940s and continue to
dominate the Tom Green County landscape (Henderson 2011).

II. Methods
In 1868, Jake Marshall established the first irrigated farm, Bismark Farm, near the community of
Over the River near present‐day San Angelo (Duke 2011). Agriculture continued to develop in the
region throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries primarily located on the Osage
Plains while ranching dominated the Edwards Plateau region (Henderson 2011). Like sheep and
cattle ranching, the development of the Santa Fe Railroad had a significant effect on agriculture in
Tom Green County. The number of farms in Tom Green County grew substantially after the
introduction of the railroad. Between 1900 and 1910, the number of farms increased by over 300
percent (Henderson 2011). Small cotton and sorghum farms continued to be the trend in the area
until 1940 when a noticeable decrease in the number of farms in the county is correlated to a rise in
average acreage of cultivated lands (Henderson 2011). These larger farms emphasized cotton
cultivation, and today cotton production rivals cattle and sheep as dominant economic institutions
in the area (Henderson 2011). The rise of large farms has resulted in over 200,000 of the county's
1 million acres being cultivated by 1990, of which only 15,000 acres were irrigated (Henderson
2011).
Oil was discovered in the area in the 1920s, and Tom Green County certainly experienced the
effects of the Permian Basin oil boom when the population of San Angelo doubled from 1920 to
1930 (Duke 2011). Oil was not located in Tom Green County itself until 1940, and while the oil and
gas exploration industry has maintained a modest position in the region’s economy and helped to
develop an associated oilfield equipment–manufacturing industry, the county never experienced
growth from the oil and gas industry quite like the Permian Basin oil boom of the 1920s
(Henderson 2011).
Although ranching and irrigated farming are still vital aspects of the area economy, these industries
have declined steadily since the 1940s. The project area, like the nation as a whole, became more
urbanized following World War II, and many area farms and ranches were abandoned or leased for
oil and gas extraction or cattle grazing. Small‐scale irrigated farming was replaced in large part by
large‐scale agribusiness (Henderson 2011).

III. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION AND PROPERTY TYPES
At the project’s northern terminus, the proposed line begins at the Twin Buttes Substation and
travels south through sparsely occupied ranchlands to its intersection with FM 853. At FM 853,
there is a small cluster of development that includes the remnants of an abandoned circa 1900
farmstead (01), a circa 1915 cemetery (02), and a circa 1915 schoolhouse with several secondary
structures (03). From there, the line continues south through sparsely developed ranchland,
making some east‐west turns, but generally continuing south to its intersection with US 67 and the
Panhandle and Santa Fe Railroad (site 08) near the Tankersley Ranch (site 06) and the remnants of
the former community of Tankersley (sites 07, 09–11). The proposed line turns slightly southwest
across a cleared field and then south, roughly parallel to FM 2355, through unimproved ranchland
to its crossing at Spring Creek, just east of a concrete dam impounding Rust Reservoir (site 12). The
proposed line continues south, parallel with FM 2355, through unimproved ranchland and plowed
fields to a point where it turns east and crosses Dove Creek. The APE in this portion includes sparse
remnants of farm and ranch operations (sites 14–21). From there, the route follows a general
south‐southeasterly trend through primarily undeveloped ranchlands with only scattered ranch‐
related resources (sites 22 and 23). A summary of property types documented in the APE is
included in Table 1.

POTENTIALLY NRHP‐ELIGIBLE RESOURCES DOCUMENTED WITHIN THE APE
Project historians documented two potentially NRHP‐eligible properties at two sites (sites 12 and
19) within the proposed project APE. Resource 12 is a concrete dam, and Resource 19A is a
residential property. Neither of the resources will be directly affected by the project as proposed,
and due to a variety of site‐specific factors, adverse indirect/visual impacts are not anticipated at
either of these sites.
Site 12 is a circa 1910, flat‐span, concrete‐buttress dam along Spring Creek (see Figure 1, Sheet 6).
This dam appears to be part of a larger system of water management in the area, as evidenced by
the presence of similar dams in the area on current aerial photographs. The dam consists of several
flat concrete spans supported by engaged concrete buttresses and flared concrete wingwalls.
Although this resource is not architecturally significant and does not appear to maintain any
engineering significance individually, its significance should be evaluated within the context of the
entire system. In the early 1900s, several concrete dams were constructed along the numerous
water sources crossing the project area (Unknown 1922). This development allowed for irrigated
farming in the area, a significant development that impacted area land‐use patterns. The resource
retains a high degree of historic integrity and is recommended as potentially eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP under Criterion A for its associations with early irrigation efforts in the area. Irrigation
efforts in the Concho River Valley area were well under way by the 1890s using earthen dams,

III. Results and Recommendations
some of which were replaced by concrete structures in the early 1900s (Unknown 1922). In 1885,
area rancher Joseph Tweedy chartered the area’s first irrigation company, the San Jose Irrigation
Company, on Dove Creek (Tweedy 2011). LCRA personnel identified three remnant irrigation‐
related features within the APE, although it is unknown if they are associated with Resource 12. The
presence of these features further indicates the presence of an organized water management
system or systems in the area (see Figure 1, Sheet 8). Further, intensive‐level investigations of the
resource and the history of the water management system would be required to make a definitive
recommendation of eligibility for this resource.

**Historians were not able to determine the function of these buildings due to access limitations or severe alterations to the
resources that preclude their use classifications.

The proposed transmission line would be located approximately 1,500 feet east of Resource 12,
parallel with the existing, nonhistoric‐age bridge carrying FM 2335 over Spring Creek. Due to site‐
specific factors in the vicinity of the bridge, including the meander of Spring Creek and the dense
vegetation along its banks, the proposed transmission line would likely only be slightly visible from
the dam. Furthermore, the dam’s setting does not contribute to its significance. Therefore, no
adverse visual impact is anticipated at this location and no further consideration of this resource is
recommended under any applicable regulatory criteria.
Resource 19A is a circa 1925 Craftsman Bungalow located on FM 2355 near its intersection with
Heckamann Road, just northwest of Knickerbocker (see Figure 1, Sheet 8). This resource is
100017015/110012

23

III. Results and Recommendations
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion C for Architecture at the local level of
significance. It is one of the few remaining intact Craftsman‐style dwellings in the area and the best
example of its type observed in the APE and surrounding study area. The resource is located in a
heavily vegetated portion of the surrounding parcel, and there is a large plowed field located
behind the resource. There are several dilapidated outbuildings located adjacent to the resource,
but they lack known historic associations, architectural merit, and historic integrity. The vegetation
surrounding the resource would serve as a visual buffer between it and the proposed transmission
line, which would be located approximately 650 feet west of the dwelling. In addition, the
resource’s setting has already been compromised by the demolition of contemporaneous buildings
historically located at the site (Tobin International 1939). Due to the existing alterations to the
resource’s setting and the existing vegetative screening surrounding the resource, no adverse visual
effect is anticipated at this location and no further consideration of this resource is recommended
under any applicable regulatory criteria.
In addition to these two recommended eligible resources, historians also recorded one marginal
property (site 13). This property has been identified as marginal due to its potential historic
associations as a rare surviving example of a recreational resource in the APE, despite its lack of
integrity. This resource is a circa 1935 park, known as Foster Park, located along the banks of
Spring Creek (see Figure 1, Sheet 6). The park includes a circa 1935 clubhouse building (A), a
concrete dam/low‐water crossing (B), and several concrete and stone picnic tables, benches, and
outdoor grilling pits. This park is evident on a 1939 aerial photograph, which depicts FM 2355
crossing Spring Creek east of its current alignment, across the existing dam/low‐water crossing
that is now part of the park (Tobin International 1939). The road was most likely not realigned to
its current position until 1958, when the bridge carrying FM 2335 over Spring Creek was initially
constructed. This original structure is no longer extant, and the existing bridge at this site was built
in 1972 (Svirsky 2011). When FM 2335 was realigned, the new alignment bisected the park and
substantially altered its historic setting, a character‐defining feature of the resource. Additionally,
several of the park’s character‐defining features (tables, benches, etc.) have undergone alterations
to their materials and workmanship with replacement concrete table tops and repointing of
masonry work. Thus, this resource is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under any
applicable criteria, and no further consideration of the resource is recommended under Section
106.
None of the remaining resources appear to meet the minimum qualifications for inclusion in the
NRHP. Refer to the site forms in Appendix A for detailed integrity and eligibility assessments for
remaining recorded resources.

INACCESSIBLE AREAS WITHIN THE APE
Historians were not able to access large portions of the APE to determine if any historic‐age
resources are located in those areas (see Figure 1). To provide evaluations for any resources
100017015/110012

III. Results and Recommendations
located in inaccessible areas where historians were not able to survey the property from the public
ROW, historians consulted historic maps and current and historic aerial photography. Using
historic maps and aerial photographs, historians identified the following historic‐age resources
within the proposed project APE in areas where historians were not granted permissible access or
where resources were not visible from the public ROW.
Site 05 was not accessible to historians, but was partially visible from the public ROW along FM
853. Current aerial photographs indicate that there are 11 buildings at this site (A–K) of which 6 are
visible from the public ROW (see Figure 02b). These six buildings include two nonhistoric‐age
trailers (A and B), several outbuildings (C, D, J), and one circa 1955 dwelling (I). Resources are
present near the locations of resources G, F, E, J, and K in 1939, but due to the scale of the
photography, historians cannot definitively determine the integrity of design for these resources
(Tobin International 1939) (Figure 2a). Resource G appears to be a massed‐plan pyramidal‐roofed
dwelling with a projecting front‐gabled wing, a form common in the early 1900s. Resources F, E,
and J appear to be simple utilitarian barns that all appear to have additions that detract from their
integrity of form. Resource I, a circa 1955 dwelling, appears on the 1957 U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) Knickerbocker 7.5‐minute quadrangle map. The remaining resources do not appear to be of
historic age. Although historians were not able to access these resources to definitively determine
their NRHP eligibility, it is apparent that the setting at this site has been disturbed by the presence
of nonhistoric‐age buildings. Additionally, the proposed line would be located approximately 2,000
feet west of this site, parallel to an existing transmission line. Thus, no adverse visual effect is
anticipated at this location, and no further consideration of this site is recommended under any
applicable regulatory criteria.
Another historic‐age inaccessible property (resources 24A–E) is located on the south side of US 67,
approximately 1 mile northeast of its intersection with FM 2335 (see Figure 1 and Figure 3). These
resources were not visible from the public ROW; however, current aerials depict five buildings (A–
E) at this site, three of which (resources A–C) are clearly depicted on a 1939 aerial photograph (see
Figures 03a–b). Resource A appears to be a front‐gabled, linear‐plan, single‐family dwelling with a
shed‐roofed porch. This resource has a large lateral addition that is not evident in 1939, which
detracts from its integrity of design. Resources B and C appear to be agricultural outbuildings
associated with Resource A. No buildings are depicted at this site in 1928 (USGS 1928). This site
also includes a nonhistoric‐age dwelling and associated outbuilding. Their presence detracts from
the integrity of setting for resources A–D. Given the presence of a large‐scale addition to Resource A
and the loss of setting at this site, it is unlikely that these resources would possess sufficient
integrity and significance to merit inclusion in the NRHP. The proposed line would be located

III. Results and Recommendations
approximately 2,000 feet west of these resources, and US 67 is a major visual impediment between
the proposed line and this site. Therefore, no adverse visual effect is anticipated at this location and
no further consideration of this site is recommended under any applicable regulatory criteria.
Resource 25 is what appears to be a concrete dam spanning Dove Creek west of Knickerbocker (see
Figure 1). This resource is not depicted on the 1957 USGS Knickerbocker 7.5‐minute quadrangle
map but may have been built between 1957 and 1960. This resource postdates the period of
significance for irrigated farming in the project area, as it dates to the period of decline for this
land‐use activity. Therefore, it is not likely eligible for NRHP inclusion as it is not associated with
early irrigation efforts in the area. No adverse visual effect is anticipated at this location, and no
further consideration of this site is recommended under any applicable regulatory criteria.
Resources 26A–B is a cluster of buildings within a heavily vegetated area located in the center of a
large cleared field (see Figure 1 and Figure 4). Due to the dense vegetation at this site, only two
buildings are visible on current aerial photographs (see Figure 4b). In 1939, there were at least four
buildings at this site, one of which appears to have a similar roof form and is in the approximate
location of Resource A (see Figure 4a). The remaining three buildings depicted on the 1939 aerial
are no longer extant (Tobin International 1939). By 1957, only one building is depicted at this site
(USGS 1957). Due to the loss of three buildings depicted on the 1939 aerial, this site no longer
appears to retain its historic setting. Additionally, the extant structures at this site are heavily
obscured by dense vegetation that serves as a visual buffer between the buildings and the proposed
transmission line, minimizing the impact of the proposed project on this site. No further
consideration of visual impact is recommended at this location.
None of the remaining inaccessible areas of the APE appeared to contain any historic‐age resources.
No further consideration of visual impacts is recommended, and no adverse effect is anticipated in
the inaccessible portions of the APE.

HISTORIC LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS
In addition to evaluating the individual historic‐age nonarcheological resources within the
proposed project APE area, historians also conducted a brief assessment of the landscape to
determine if it may possess sufficient integrity to be NRHP eligible as a rural historic landscape.
Recent trends in cultural resource management by federal and state regulatory agencies are placing
greater emphasis on evaluating those resources as elements of their surrounding landscapes. Rural
historic landscapes are large‐area resources that may retain sufficient levels of historical
importance and integrity to be eligible for National Register listing as a special type of historic
district. According to National Register Bulletin No. 30, Guidelines for Evaluating and Documenting
Rural Historic Landscapes, evaluation of these large‐area resources requires a multidisciplinary
approach to recognize, record, and assess the importance of a wide variety of land uses and

III. Results and Recommendations
landscape elements that make up a landscape. This document does not present a full‐scale historic
landscape assessment, but rather an analysis of the landscape conditions and land‐use patterns in
the historic period as compared to those currently present within the APE. For the purpose of this
project, analysis has been limited to a comparison of historic and current maps and aerial
photography of the project area.
During its period of significance, from the 1860s through the 1940s, the most prominent land use in
the project area appears to have been ranching, particularly in the southern portion of the project
area, with a different pattern of irrigated farming in the northern portion. Sheep ranching rose to
prominence in the 1870s with irrigated farming as an important supplemental industry by the early
1900s. Although irrigated farming and ranching are still vital aspects of the area’s economy, oil and
gas extraction and a nationwide rural‐to‐urban movement diminished the prevalence of both
farming and ranching activities during the post–World War II era. Aerial photography and historic
map coverage of the project area is limited; however, using a compilation of maps and aerial
photograph sources, historians were able to review the historic land use patterns and assess the
overall integrity of the existing landscape.
The earliest coverage of the APE was found on the 1895 USGS Sherwood 7.5‐minute topographic
quadrangle. This map covers the majority of the project APE, but does not provide details such as
vegetation, fence lines, levees, dams, and ditches. This map indicates that the area was very sparsely
inhabited in 1895, with structures located along Dove Creek in the vicinity of the current Guinn
Road and in the Knickerbocker community. The majority of these structures are no longer extant,
although remnants of these developments, such as the Tankersley Ranch, are scattered throughout
the APE. It also depicts historic‐period transportation routes, a few of which follow the general
alignment of existing roads. These include Arden Road, US 67, Knickerbocker Road, and Guinn
Road. Although the historic roadways are in the approximate location of existing roads, the current
roads have been rerouted as transportation methods and needs evolved.
The 1928 USGS Tankersly [sic] 7.5‐minute topographic quadrangle covers only a small portion of
the project APE, skirting the eastern boundary of the northern portion of the project area. Although
this source does not reveal specific information regarding the APE, it does show general
development patterns in the area. Notably, this map shows a series of small dams along the Middle
Concho River, Spring Creek, and Dove Creek. Although none of the dams depicted on the map are
within the proposed project APE, their presence indicates that water control and irrigation
improvements were present in the general area by the mid‐1920s, probably for agricultural
purposes. The 1928 map also includes several additional transportation routes not depicted on the
USGS 1895 Sherwood 7.5‐minute topographic quadrangle. Significantly, the Kansas City, New
Mexico and Orient Railroad bisects the APE in the northern portion of the project area, near the
present Tankersley Ranch, though the ranch headquarters itself is not located within the map’s
coverage area. The arrival of the railroad made it more efficient for area ranchers and farmers to
ship their goods to new markets and allowed for the import of more‐advanced agricultural
100017015/110012

33

III. Results and Recommendations
equipment, both of which fueled agricultural production. Between 1895 and 1928, a network of
minor roadways developed, presumably linking area farms and ranches with the larger roadways
and with each other, allowing easier transport of farm and ranch goods to railhead shipping hubs
like San Angelo. Though the 1928 Tankersly topographic map indicates a higher population density
than in 1895, the area remained distinctly rural with a sparse distribution of building sites across
the overall landscape. Most of the buildings on the 1928 map were clustered in the Knickerbocker
community or along major and minor roadways.
Aerial photography dating from 1939 provides coverage of the entire project APE and shows major
land‐use patterns across the area during the early twentieth century. A clear pattern of irrigated
fields is evident in the northern portion of the project area, with approximately 50 percent of the
APE having characteristics consistent with cultivated crop production. The land‐use pattern
transitions to rangeland from the area around Knickerbocker to the southern terminus of the
project area, although some cultivated fields are interspersed across the southern portion of the
APE. The primary transportation routes evident on the 1939 photograph include FM 853 (Arden to
San Angelo Road), Sherwood and San Angelo Road (along the approximate alignment of present‐
day US 67), a road roughly following the current alignment of FM 2355 between Tankersley and
Knickerbocker, Knickerbocker Road, Guinn Road and the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad
(formerly the Kansas City, Mexico and Orient Railroad) (Tobin International 1939; Werner 2011).
The Sherwood and San Angelo Road, Knickerbocker Road, and FM 853 were primarily used to link
rural communities to San Angelo, the nearest major commercial, shipping, and processing hub. FM
2355 and Guinn Road appear to have been used as more‐regional roadways, linking area farms and
ranches to Knickerbocker, each other, and FM 853 and Knickerbocker Road. While Knickerbocker
remained the largest developed community in the area, Tankersley, centered near the headquarters
of the Tankersley Ranch, had a cluster of buildings including a railroad depot and schoolhouse. The
southern portion of the project area remained virtually undeveloped, with very sparse buildings,
roadways, or improved acreage evident. Given the rugged topography of the area, it likely was used
primarily for rangeland.
By 1957, aerial photograph coverage of the APE is limited to the portion north of Knickerbocker.
The northern portion of the project area appears less devoted to farming, as many of the cleared
fields evident in 1939 appear to be overgrown with vegetation in 1957 (USGS 1957). This trend is
consistent with a general rural‐to‐urban movement in the United States in the post–World War II
era when many farms were abandoned or leased for cattle grazing or oil and gas extraction. Given
the rough topography of the southern portion of the APE, it is unlikely that it was used for purposes
other than ranching rangeland or oil and gas extraction, activities that persist in the area.
During the field survey, historians encountered notable alterations to the landscape since the end of
the historic period in 1960. The transportation network has been altered by the realignment of FM
2335 and by the abandonment of several minor roads that once linked the area’s many farms and
ranches. With the abandonment of several farms in the northern portion of the APE, boundary
100017015/110012

34

III. Results and Recommendations
demarcations, fence lines, and vegetation patterns have shifted. Several nonhistoric‐age bridges are
currently located along FM 2335 and former creek crossings have been abandoned. A large area
along FM 2335, between Spring Creek and Knickerbocker Road, has been subdivided into small lots
containing nonhistoric‐age dwellings. Oil and gas extraction activities have increased substantially
in the area and continue to be a dominant facet of land use in the vicinity. Although oil and gas
extraction may have occurred in the historic period, historians did not encounter any aboveground
historic‐age resources associated with this industry. The rise of this industry has also changed the
transportation system, as networks of oil and gas roads are currently located in the APE.
Additionally, a large nonhistoric‐age wind farm is located in the southern portion of the project
area, detracting from the landscape’s integrity in that area. Large‐scale transmission lines also cross
the APE, paralleling it in the extreme northern leg of the project and bisecting it north of US 67. Due
to these changes, it is unlikely that the landscape within the APE would retain sufficient integrity to
be recommended for inclusion in the NRHP as the area has seen significant alterations into its land‐
use patterns and activities, transportation networks, and built environment.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, historians identified two properties recommended for inclusion in the NRHP (sites 12
and 19) and four inaccessible properties (sites 05, 24, 25, and 26). No new ROW will be required
from these resources, and they will not be directly impacted by the proposed project. As detailed in
the results discussion, project historians recommend that the proposed project does not pose an
adverse visual effect to any of these potentially eligible resources. The key factor that limits the
potential for adverse impacts to recommended NRHP‐eligible site 19 and inaccessible properties
05, 24, 25, and 26 is their reduced integrity of setting. For site 12, existing site‐specific landscape
features and the character‐defining features of the resource diminish the potential for adverse
visual impacts. Therefore, the proposed project does not have the potential to adversely impact or
alter historically significant qualities of the potentially NRHP‐eligible resources.

This resource does not appear to meet the requirements for NRHP
eligibility as it does not exhibit any distinctive styles of funerary art or
cemetery design nor does it appear to have any association with
significant persons, events, or trends. Furthermore, it is neither of
exceptional age nor does it represent the remaining vestige of a
community or contain the graves of any person of known transcendent
importance. Additionally, the resource’s setting has already been
compromised by the presence of an existing transmission line in the
immediate vicinity. Therefore, this resource is not recommended for
inclusion in the NRHP.

This parcel includes several standing structures of indeterminate age,
function, and condition. Historians were not able to fully document and
assess these resources from the public ROW and permissible access to
the property was not granted. Therefore, their NRHP eligibility cannot
be fully assessed. See “Inaccessible Areas within the APE,” in Chapter III
of the report for further discussion of these resources.
Although historians were not able to fully assess the property, several
nonhistoric-age manufactured homes were noted at the site from the
public ROW. No adverse visual impact is anticipated to any potentially
NRHP-eligible properties at this location. Additionally, an existing
transmission line currently runs parallel and adjacent to the proposed
line. The existing line and the presence of known nonhistoric-age
resources at the site would detract from any integrity of setting to any
potential NRHP-eligible resources at this location. Therefore, the
proposed transmission line would not impact the resource(s)’ setting as
its setting has already be greatly altered. No further consideration of
visual impact is recommended for this site.

These resources are the remnants of the Tankersley Ranch. The
Tankersley Ranch was founded in the 1860s along the Concho River by
the Richard Franklin and Annie Ellen Allen Tankersley families. This large
ranch became the hub of a small rural ranching community in the area.
Resource A is the Tankersley Ranch main dwelling. This resource lacks
integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and feeling due to some
replacement windows, replacement porch supports, and the enclosure
of the rear double-gallery porch. Resources B–F are a grouping of
several circa 1950 agricultural buildings of no architectural merit. All of
these outbuildings have suffered deterioration and appear to be
missing at least some of their original materials. Resource G is a small
stone building of indeterminate use that may have been an outdoor
kitchen. This resource lacks integrity of materials, design, workmanship,
feeling, and association due to its missing roof, windows, and doors.
Resource H is a barrel-vaulted concrete storm shelter. The resource
lacks any architectural significance and also lacks associative

significance. All of these buildings lack integrity of setting due to the
demolition of contemporaneous structures and the addition of
nonhistoric-age structures at the site. Thus, despite the site’s historic
associations, these resources do not possess sufficient integrity to merit
inclusion in the NRHP and are recommended not eligible for inclusion
individually or as a group.
Resources are not recommended for NRHP eligibility. Furthermore,
these resources are located approximately 0.25 mile west of the
proposed line, and existing intrusions to their setting including modern
streetscape elements associated with US 67 and a nearby cellular tower
minimize any potential impact from the proposed line. In addition,
historic aerial photography depicts several buildings associated with
these resources that are no longer extant and a definite circulation
patterns linking these resources to former community elements such as
a freight depot and school that are no longer extant. No further
consideration of visual impact is recommended for this site.

series of dams along area waterways, this resource may also retain
historic associations. This resource is potentially eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP, but further work would be required to make a conclusive
recommendation.
Although this resource is potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP,
its setting would not be impacted by the proposed transmission line.
This resource is located approximately 0.5 mile west of the proposed
line, and due to the topography of the area, the line would not be
visible from the resource. Additionally, there is a nonhistoric-age bridge
carrying FM 2335 over Spring Creek in the vicinity of the proposed line,
which is a nonhistoric-age setting intrusion. No further consideration of
visual impact is recommended for this site.

Resource 13 consists of a recreational area along Spring Creek known as
Foster Park. Individual resources at this location include the park
clubhouse (A) and a dam/low-water crossing (B). The park and the
individual resources lack integrity of setting and feeling due to the
construction of the bridge carrying FM 2335 over Spring Creek.
According to TxDOT’s historic bridge database, a bridge was constructed
at this crossing in 1958, but reconstructed in 1976. Historic maps
indicate that the crossing was located to the east of the current bridge,
along the existing dam and low-water crossing that is currently part of
the park, as late as 1957. While the park may have historic associations,
these setting alterations are so severe and setting is a crucial characterdefining element of the park that it is recommended not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.
These resources are not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP and
their setting has been altered. No further consideration of visual impact
is recommended for this site.

This site includes four historic-age buildings (A–D). Resource A is a circa
1925 Craftsman Bungalow. This wood-framed building has a side-gabled
roof with half-hipped, full-width, projecting entry porch. The porch is
supported by four evenly spaced sets of box columns upon brick piers.
The exterior is clad in beaded wooden siding. The resource has a rear
addition; however, this addition appears to be historic-age and is in the
same style as the original portion of the dwelling. This resource is
recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion C for
architecture at the local level of significance as a good example of a
Craftsman bungalow in the area. It retains integrity of materials,
workmanship, feeing, association, and location. Resource B is the ruined
remnants of a circa 1940 double-crib, pull-through barn. This resource’s
roof is no longer extant and it is missing several large portions of its
lateral facades, detracting from its integrity of materials, workmanship,
design, feeling, and association. Resource C is a front-gabled
agricultural outbuilding. This resource has been reclad and has
replacement windows, impacting its integrity of workmanship,
materials, and feeling and it lacks architectural merit. Resource D is a

small, nondescript, shed-roofed outbuilding. Although this resource
retains integrity of location, design, workmanship, feeling, location, and
association, it lacks associative and architectural significance. All of
these resources lack integrity of setting due to the construction of
nonhistoric-age structures at the site and the loss of several no longer
extant structures depicted on historic aerial photographs, and only
Resource A is recommended for inclusion in the NRHP.
Resource A is recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion C
for Architecture at the local level of significance. Although
recommended eligible, this resource does not retain integrity of setting,
and setting is not one of the character-defining features of the property
that render it eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. The proposed
transmission line would be located approximately 1,200 feet west of
Resource A. Therefore, no adverse effect is anticipated at this location.

stone dwelling with multiple additions. The resource’s stone veneer has
been repointed with cement mortar, and it has numerous additions and
replacement windows. These alterations detract from its integrity of
design, materials, workmanship, and feeling. Resource B is a circular
aboveground water tank. This stone tank’s mortar has been patched
with cement, detracting from its integrity of materials and
workmanship. Resource C is a circa 1950, open-geared, ladder-back
windmill. This windmill is of common form and lacks associative or
engineering merit. These resources are located within a complex that
also includes several nonhistoric-age barns and sheds. Additionally, a
large-scale wind farm is visible on the horizon to the south. Thus, these
resources do not retain integrity of setting. None of the recorded
resources at this site are recommended for inclusion in the NRHP.
This resource is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP. No further

I. INTRODUCTION
This report is an addendum to a nonarcheological historic resources report titled Visual Impacts
Assessment for the Proposed Twin Buttes­McCamey­D 345­kV CREZ Transmission Line Project, Tom
Green and Schleicher Counties, Texas, originally submitted to the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
in March 2011. The original submittal reported the results of a nonarcheological historic resources
and visual effects study of the proposed Twin Buttes‐McCamey D 345‐kV transmission line in Tom
Green and Schleicher counties, Texas. Additional work was required to address a proposed reroute
of the transmission line south of the Knickerbocker community (Figure 1) and to provide
additional, intensive‐level survey of two properties identified in the original submittal as requested
by the THC in April of 2011.
The proposed reroute begins at a point east of Tweedy Road, where it diverges from the original
route approximately 0.2 mile due east through a plowed field. The proposed reroute then turns
southward, following a general south‐southeasterly trend through unimproved scrub brush, for
approximately 1.7 miles, where it intersects the original route. This addendum includes two
appendices (A and B), two tables of recorded resources and property types (tables 1 and 2), a
project and resource location map (Figure 1), and a site plan for Resource 13 (Foster Park) (Figure
2). Appendix A includes resource documentation forms for all newly recorded resources within the
area of potential effect (APE) of the proposed reroute alignment, and Appendix B includes
intensive‐level resource documentation forms for resources 12 and 13. The information presented
on the forms includes photographic documentation and brief National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and visual impact analyses.

II. METHODS
In May 2011, a team of professionally qualified architectural historians examined an APE extending
0.5 mile beyond each side of the proposed reroute’s centerline. The purpose of the survey was to
identify historically significant (NRHP‐listed or ‐eligible) resources (including buildings, structures,
objects, districts, etc.) 50‐years‐of‐age or older that could be adversely affected by the construction
of the proposed line. For the purposes of this survey, historians used a 1960 cutoff date for
identification of historic‐age resources. Historians also revisited two previously documented
resources and completed intensive‐level documentation of these resources in response to
comments received from the THC in April of 2011. The THC requested additional documentation of
Resource 12 to determine if it may be eligible for NRHP inclusion under Criterion C and to evaluate
potential effects to the resource. Additionally, THC requested additional documentation of Resource
13 to determine the resource’s eligibility as a historic district and to define the NRHP boundaries of
the property.
In the field, the historians visually examined all historic‐age resources within the proposed
reroute’s APE that were visible from the public right of way (ROW). Recorded resources were
photo‐documented, and their locations were mapped. The documentation photos, along with
limited secondary‐source historical research completed during the initial survey effort, were used
to develop NRHP‐eligibility assessments for all newly recorded resources and to complete the
respective resource documentation forms (Appendix A). Historians revisited resources 12 (a dam
spanning Spring Creek) and 13 (Foster Park) to conduct intensive‐level documentation at these
locations. Historians took additional photographs of these resources and completed a site plan for
the park to facilitate NRHP eligibility analysis of the resources.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800, the NRHP eligibility assessments were developed by applying
NRHP eligibility criteria with regard to locally relevant historic development patterns. During the
survey efforts, project historians also sought to identify and record any designated or potentially
historic residential and commercial districts within or extending into the APE, but none were
encountered.

III. RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION AND PROPERTY TYPES
The proposed reroute is located in the same general area as the original proposed route. The
reroute begins in a cleared field approximately 0.2 mile east of Tweedy Road. It travels east through
the cleared field and then turns south, just west of a cluster of buildings within a grove of trees
(Resource 26), crossing one fenceline and continuing through a vegetated area roughly parallel to
Farm‐to‐Market Road (FM) 2335 and crossing Guinn Road. It then continues through vegetated
rangeland to a point of intersection with the original proposed route.

NRHP ELIGIBILITY ASSESSMENT FOR NEWLY RECORDED RESOURCES
Project historians documented two historic‐age resources at two properties within the proposed
project APE. Resource 27 is the Knickerbocker Catholic Cemetery, and Resource 28 is an abandoned
residential property. Neither of the resources will be directly affected by the proposed reroute.
Site 27 is a circa 1885 Catholic cemetery located on the southern periphery of the Knickerbocker
community, unofficially known as the Knickerbocker Catholic Cemetery. The cemetery is enclosed
by a barbed wire fence with both wooden and metal fence posts and accessed via two entrances off
FM 2335 at the resource’s northeast and southeast corners. The cemetery includes approximately
80 marked burials dating from 1884 through the present, and it appears to still be in use. The
marked burials are roughly arranged in five rows, with gravel driveways intervening between the
westernmost three rows, and the burials are all oriented to the east, a common practice in the
Christian burial tradition. Historians noted one false crypt constructed of rough‐cut stone laid in an
irregular course. Some of the family burial plots are marked by metal fencing or concrete curbs,
some of which are inscribed. The majority of the grave markers are constructed of polished granite
or cast concrete. There is a large metal crucifix statue located in the rear portion of the cemetery.
This resource does not appear to meet the requirements set forth in NRHP Bulletin 15, Criteria
Consideration D, as it does not contain the graves of any persons of transcendent importance,
exhibit distinctive design features, possess great relative age, or maintain any association with an
historic event. Therefore, this cemetery is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion A, B, or C.
Site 28 is a circa 1935 single‐family dwelling located southwest of the intersection of Guinn Road
and FM 2335. This resource has a front‐gabled roof with a clipped gable end that has been reclad in
seamed metal. False masonry rolled asphalt covers the original wooden horizontal siding. The
Atkins 100017015/110111

III. Results and Recommendations
windows are 1/1 wooden‐sash units, and some of the sashes are no longer extant. The entry porch
is no longer extant, but it appears to have been a projecting front‐gabled porch. The resource has a
large, nonhistoric‐age lateral addition clad in seamed metal. These alterations detract from the
resource’s integrity of design, materials, workmanship, and feeling. Additionally, this resource has
no known historic associations. Thus, this dwelling is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion A, B, or C.

INTENSIVE‐LEVEL SURVEY RESULTS
Historians revisited Resource 12, a concrete dam spanning Spring Creek, to perform intensive‐level
documentation. Based upon the results of this documentation, historians no longer recommend the
dam for inclusion in the NRHP as it has undergone extensive repair and alteration and several of its
character‐defining features are no longer extant due to the resource’s deterioration. Several of the
concrete buttresses have deteriorated and broken at the slab‐buttress junction. The three
remaining buttresses appear to be replacement members as they do not match the size and shape
of the other buttress fragments. Additionally, several concrete slabs are no longer extant. Historians
noted numerous buttress and slab remnants in the creek bed, downstream from the dam. The
aprons and abutments appear to have been patched several times with poured concrete over the
original cast concrete. These alterations detract from the resource’s integrity of design, materials,
workmanship, and feeling. Due to its lack of integrity, the resource is not recommended for NRHP
inclusion under any of the applicable criteria.
Historians also revisited Foster Park (Resource 13) to perform intensive‐level documentation to
determine appropriate NRHP boundaries for the resource (Figure 2). Although historians were not
able to determine the exact construction date for the resource, it was in use by 1939 (Holt 1939;
Tobin International 1939). In 1971, a major storm caused widespread flooding in the area and
resulted in severe damage to the park. The low‐water crossing was completely inundated, and
many of the park’s tables were torn from their foundations (Fletcher 1971).
The park is located at the intersection of Spring Creek and FM 2335. The majority of the park is
located on the east side of the roadway, although there are a few remnants of park amenities
located on the southern bank of Spring Creek west of FM 2335. The park clubhouse (Resource 13A)
is located on the south side of Spring Creek, east of FM 2335. This resource is a linear‐plan building
with a hipped roof. The building is clad in stone veneer and has an open‐air central bay with stone
columns and clamped buttresses at the corners. The building has a replacement metal roof with
exposed rafter tails and replacement metal windows.
Near the clubhouse building, between FM 2335 and the dam/low‐water crossing, there are several
park features. Nonhistoric‐age features south of Spring Creek include two waste receptacles, three
metal table and bench sets, a grill, and three buildings. There are an additional four semicircular,

III. Results and Recommendations
historic‐age stone benches, remnants of a stone and concrete foundation, and a stone culvert/
footbridge. Due to changes is the topography of the area, the culvert/footbridge no longer functions,
and the area beneath it is completely in‐filled with dirt and grass. The historic‐age tables are in
varying states of disrepair, and all have been repointed with Portland cement. On the south side of
Spring Creek, west of FM 2335, there is one historic‐age stone fire pit, one historic‐age semicircular
stone bench, and two stone tables with concrete tops. Historians also noted remnant stones in the
area.
The remainder of the park is located northeast of the intersection of Spring Creek and FM 2335.
This area includes 12 historic‐age stone table and bench picnic sets, 10 nonhistoric‐age metal table
and bench picnic sets, and 1 nonhistoric‐age wooden table and bench picnic set. There are also 11
nonhistoric‐age metal waste receptacles, 11 nonhistoric‐age metal grills, a metal and stone historic‐
age entry sign, a nonhistoric‐age information sign, nonhistoric‐age playground equipment, and 3
historic‐age stone fire pits. Historians also noted several concrete and stone foundation remnants
and remnants of stone amenities. All of the historic‐age features north of Spring Creek appear to
have lost some degree of historic integrity. It appears that the majority of the tabletops have been
replaced and that the original stone benches and table supports were at some point covered with
concrete slabs. These slabs generally have been removed or are no longer extant. In other instances,
the stone benches are intact, but the tables have been replaced with concrete table tops and
supports. The extant stone features appear to have all been repointed with Portland cement.
Additionally, it appears that the shoreline has eroded significantly, and it is possible that some of
the park features are no longer extant as they may have fallen into the creek.
The park’s original entry is located off of FM 2335, on the north side of Spring Creek. This resource
is a stone and iron sign with raised mortar. In the vicinity of the sign is a nonhistoric‐age metal sign
and nonhistoric‐age playground equipment.
The park’s southeastern boundary is marked by a buttressed, flat‐slab, concrete dam. The dam
carries an abandoned low‐water crossing that was the original route of FM 2335 over Spring Creek
(Tobin International 1939). The dam appears to have had a stone railing that has been replaced
with a concrete railing. The stone abutments have been covered with poured concrete. The
roadway carried by the dam has been closed to vehicular traffic, but is accessible to pedestrians.
This is the primary link between the northern portion of the park (where the bulk of the amenities
are located) and the southern portion of the park (where the clubhouse and restroom facilities are
located).
In total, historians documented 72 buildings, structures, and objects at Foster Park. Of those, 26
(approximately 36 percent) are historic age. The historic‐age resources, as a collective, do not
retain integrity of materials, workmanship, design, or setting due to replacement table tops, mortar
repointing, and the intrusion of nonhistoric‐age elements (replacement park amenities and the
nonhistoric‐age bridge carrying FM 2355 over Spring Creek) in the vicinity. Given the proliferation

Atkins 100017015/110111

III. Results and Recommendations
of nonhistoric‐age intrusions at the site, it does not appear that the park retains sufficient integrity
for inclusion in the NRHP as a historic district. However, the clubhouse building may be eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A for recreation at the local level of significance and under
Criterion C for architecture at the local level of significance as a good local example of Works
Progress Administration–era rustic architecture. Table 1 details the historic‐age and nonhistoric‐
age resources documented at the park.

Although Resource 13A is recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A and C, setting is
not a character‐defining feature of the resource. The building’s setting has been compromised by
the presence of 46 nonhistoric‐age park structures in the vicinity and by the 1972 bridge carrying
FM 2335 over Spring Creek. The proposed transmission line would be located approximately 1,200
feet west of Resource 13A, parallel to and west of the FM 2335 bridge.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, historians identified two new historic‐age resources within the proposed reroute area
(sites 24 and 25), and neither property is recommended for inclusion in the NRHP. Upon revisiting
and reevaluating Resource 12, historians no longer recommend it for inclusion in the NRHP due to
its profound lack of historic integrity. After performing intensive‐level documentation of Foster
Park (Resource 13), historians recommend that the park does not possess sufficient historic
integrity to merit inclusion in the NRHP as a historic district, but the park clubhouse (Resource
13A) is recommended for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A for Recreation at the local level
of significance and Criterion C for Architecture at the local level of significance. However, due to the
presence of the nonhistoric‐age FM 2335 bridge between the resource and the proposed
transmission line, no adverse effect is anticipated at this location and no further consideration of
the resource is recommended under Section 106.

Along FM 2335, approximately 500 feet south of Guinn Road
ca. 1935
Front Gabled/Vernacular
Vacant/No Longer in Use
This resource lacks integrity of materials, design, workmanship, and
feeling due to its missing window components, recladding with faux
brick rolled asphalt, recladding of the roof with corrugated metal,
removal of front and back porches, and nonhistoric lateral addition.
This resource is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP, and thus
no further consideration of visual impact is recommended at this
location.

Within the Spring Creek approximately 0.5 mile west of FM 2335

Flat Slab Buttress Dam/Utilitarian
Agriculture: Irrigation
This resource appears to maintain integrity of location, setting, and
association. However, the property has undergone extensive
alterations and repairs that impact its integrity of materials, design,
workmanship, and feeling. The aprons and abutments have been
repaired with poured concrete, and most of the concrete buttresses
have deteriorated and are only partially extant. Additionally, the upper
portion of the dam, supported by the buttresses has mostly broken off.
Several concrete spans and buttress pieces were noted within the creek
bed, downstream of the resource. Given these alterations, the resource
is not recommended for inclusion in the NRHP.
Although historians no longer recommend this resource eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP, it is also noted that the proposed project would
not pose an adverse visual impact to the resource if it were determined
eligible. An existing distribution line to the north of the resource already
serves as a visual disruption to the resource’s setting. No further
consideration of visual impact is recommended for this resource.

13 A–B (Foster Park)
At Spring Creek and FM 2335
ca. 1935
Hipped Roof/Rustic (A), Flat‐Slab Buttress Dam/Utilitarian (B)
Recreation: Park (A), Recreation: Park/Civic: Water Control (B)
Resource 13 consists of a recreational area along Spring Creek known as
Foster Park. Individual resources at this location include the park
clubhouse (A) and a dam/low‐water crossing (B). The park also includes
several park amenities such as waste receptacles, picnic table sets, fire
pits, barbeque grills, and benches. Historians documented a total of 72
features at this location, including resources A and B. Of these, only 26
were of historic age. Most of the historic‐age resources at the park
(sign, table sets, fire pits, benches, dam, bridge/culvert, and reservoir)
are of stone construction. The majority lack integrity of materials,
design, and workmanship due to their deteriorated condition, and
insensitive repair using Portland cement. The park as a whole lacks
integrity of feeling and setting due to the proliferation of nonhistoric‐
age park amenities and the presence of the nonhistoric‐age FM 2335
bridge located on the park’s western periphery. Thus, the park as a
whole appears to lack sufficient integrity to merit inclusion in the NRHP
as a historic district. However, Resource 13A (the clubhouse building)
appears to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A for
Recreation and Criterion C for Architecture at the local level of
significance.

Appendix B (Cont’d)
Visual Impact Assessment:

Atkins 100020727/110112

Resource A lacks integrity of setting due to the presence of nonhistoric‐
age buildings and park features in the immediate vicinity and the
nonhistoric‐age FM 2335 bridge. Thus, setting is not a character‐
defining aspect of integrity that contributes to the resource’s eligibility.
As the proposed transmission line would be located approximately 0.2
mile west of the resource, no adverse visual impact is anticipated and
no further evaluation of the resource is recommended under Section
106.
