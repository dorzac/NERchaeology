ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for the proposed Drennan Road East in central
Montgomery County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) on July 13, 2010 under Antiquities Permit 5698 for the City of Conroe. The
new road will be 2150 feet long and 62 feet wide (3.1 acres). No archaeological
sites were found, and no artifacts were collected. Copies of the report are on file at
the Texas Historical Commission, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, the
Texas State Library, City of Conroe, and BVRA.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The City of Conroe plans to construct a new road to be named Drennan
Road East in the city limits of Conroe, Texas as Phase III of the proposed
Plantation Drive and Drennan Road Project (Figure 1). The new road will begin
at the intersection of the proposed Plantation Drive North and Plantation Drive
South and extend east to North Frazier Street (State Highway 75). The new road
will be 2150 feet in length and 62 feet in width (3.1 acres), and it will consist of
four lanes and a median. The project area is depicted on the USGS 7.5’
topographic quadrangle Conroe (3095-132) dated 1958 and photorevised in
1976 (Figure 2) and an aerial photograph dated 2005 (Figure 3).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the project area. The client is the City of Conroe, and
BVRA was retained to perform the archaeological survey. William E. Moore was
the Principal Investigator. Edward P. Baxter was the Project Archaeologist, and
he was assisted by Phillip C. Bishop. The field survey involved sixteen person
hours and was performed on July 13, 2010. The reviewing agency is the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the
presence of previously recorded sites and prior archaeological surveys and projects
in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work
in Montgomery County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of
prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. Those reports reviewed include work
in the San Jacinto River Basin by Harry J. Shafer (1968) and a 450-acre tract in
Harris and Montgomery counties conducted by BVRA (Moore 1991). The project
area was investigated primarily by shovel testing, since most of the ground surface
was obscured with forest litter due to the presence of thick woods. Shovel tests
were dug to sterile clay, and excavated earth from the tests was screened using ¼
inch hardware cloth. Shovel test data were entered onto a log (Appendix I), and the
project was documented through field notes and digital photography. Eight shovel
tests were excavated (Figure 4).

RESULTS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
previously recorded prehistoric sites had been recorded in close proximity to the
project area. Also, there is no evidence that the area has been surveyed or visited
by a professional archaeologist. At the time of this investigation, the area was in
thick woods with poor surface visibility (Figure 5). Disturbance was observed in the
area of shovel tests 5-8 where clearing and scraping had taken place. Five of the
eight shovel tests encountered clay at or within 10 cm of the surface, and clay was
present at 25 cm in one test. The only shovel test that was dug through deep
sandy soil was the first test at the extreme western end of the proposed road. It was
dug through 90 cm of sandy loam before clay was encountered. The only structure
within the right-of-way is a modern metal building that was being used for storage.
This structure will be demolished or moved, but it has no architectural or historic
significance. No archaeological sites were found, and it is our opinion that the
project area was not occupied in prehistoric times because of the distance from the
area to a perennial stream. The nearest such water source is Stewarts Creek that
is 8000 feet to the east.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found as a result of this
survey. It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the
construction of the road, all work must stop until the Texas Historical Commission
can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission.
