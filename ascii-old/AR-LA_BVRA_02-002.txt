ABSTRACT
This management summary documents the results of monitoring activities
under United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), New Orleans District
Permit MVN-2007-541-WY. The project area included parts of Acadia, Allen,
Evangeline, Jefferson Davis, and St. Landry parishes. The fieldwork was
performed by Dixie Environmental Services Co., LP (DESCO) under the direction
of Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) and Consulting Archaeologist
Edward P. Baxter between May 29, 2008 and March 22, 2009. All of the known
sites in the project area were avoided by the drilling operation, and certain source
points within high probability areas were moved to avoid possible sites. During
the planning phase, source points were placed within the known boundaries of
prehistoric sites16AC31, 16AC34, 16AC39, 16AC41, 16AC43, 16AC49, 16AC55,
and 16EV56. These source points were moved to avoid these sites.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Zachry Exploration of San Antonio, Texas conducted 3-D seismic
operations within a 208 square mile (133,363 acres) tract in Acadia, Allen,
Evangeline, Jefferson Davis, and St. Landry parishes, Louisiana (Figure 1). High
probability areas for cultural resource sites were established, and all known
archaeological sites were identified. A 100-foot buffer was located around all
known archaeological sites (except those determined to be not eligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places), and they were avoided by drilling
operations. All source points placed within the established high probability areas
were visited by an archaeologist, the areas were assessed as to their potential
for possible sites, and (if needed) were moved. The project area is depicted on
eight 7.5’ USGS topographic quadrangles. They are Basile (30092-D5), Duralde
(30092-E5), Elton (30092-D6), Evangeline (30092-C5), Eunice North (30092-E4),
Eunice South (30092-D4), Iota (30092-C4), and Richard (30092-D3).

METHODS
The first phase of this project was the preparation of an avoidance map for
the proposed seismic operations (Appendix I). This included a check of the site
records at the Louisiana Division of Archaeology where site plotting on 7.5’
USGS topographic quadrangles, site forms, and relevant archaeological reports
were reviewed. The locations of previously recorded prehistoric and historic sites
were then plotted on the project area maps. Then the Principal Investigator and
Project Archaeologist identified high probability areas for the presence of
archaeological sites. This determination was based on the location of known
sites, a review of relevant literature, and natural features on the landscape as
depicted on the topographic quadrangles. These areas were plotted on the
project area map for avoidance.
The field phases of the project involved DESCO archaeologists who
visually inspected each source point placed in the high probability areas
established for this project. These points were marked by a wooden stake or
lath. The source point number was written on each stake, and colored flagging
was attached for good visibility in the woods. The archaeologists examined the
landform and made a field determination regarding the potential for an
archaeological site at each source point based on known criteria for site potential
such as sandy soil and elevated landforms adjacent to a water source. If a
source point was found to be in a prime location for an archaeological site, it was
moved or offset to an area of lower probability.
From May 29, 2008 through March 22, 2009, archaeologists inspected
approximately 3400 source points within the project area. On average, there
were eight to ten drills on site with as many as fourteen at times. In all, 18,621
points were drilled. No observable archaeological sites within the project area
were impacted. The field portion of this project was documented through field
notes and digital photography. In order to assess the status of each source point
in the high probability areas, the archaeologist(s) on site met with the Project
Manager each morning to obtain the daily map produced for the drillers. Each
source point scheduled to be drilled that day that was inside a high probability
area was checked against the main map maintained by the archaeologists in the
survey office. As points were inspected in the field, they were then marked off on
the main map when the archaeologists returned at the end of the day. If a point
had previously been inspected, then it was so notated on the drillers’ maps. Both
the archaeologist and the powder man initialed each map, and a copy was made.

3

The field notes included a Production Log, which was filled in daily by all
crewmembers in the field. This log contained pertinent information for each
source point that was visually inspected by archaeologists. Notations were made
as to whether cultural resources were present or likely to be present. If the area
appeared to be a likely setting for an archaeological site, the stake was pulled
and returned to the survey office at the end of the day for resetting. Table 1
documents the source points that were moved to avoid archaeological sites and
high probability areas. The archaeologist who pulled the stake worked with the
survey crew to determine the offset. If the area was unlikely to contain cultural
resources (e.g., low and wet, swampy, in a drainage or plowed field, etc.) then a
similar notation was made that meant the point was cleared for drilling, and
nothing further was required to be done. A master spreadsheet containing all the
data from the Daily Production Log (s) was maintained.

RESULTS
The literature search revealed the presence of 29 archaeological sites
within the boundaries of the project area (Table 2). These sites consist of twenty
prehistoric sites and nine historic sites. Eight sites are not eligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places, and the eligibility of twenty-one sites is
unknown. The majority of sites were recorded by individuals such as avocational
archaeologist Charles N. Bollich in the 1970s and Robert Maybrier in the 1980s.
Those recorded as a result of professional surveys were found by archaeologists
working for Coastal Environments, Inc., R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates,
PBS&J, and the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development. The
recorders of four sites are unknown. Very little information is available for these
sites, and many of the site forms are incomplete. The 29 archaeological sites are
discussed in Site Descriptions below.
Nine of the prehistoric sites are described on the site forms as campsites.
One prehistoric site is described as a hamlet or village, and one is described as a
small village. The function of nine prehistoric sites is stated on the site forms as
unknown. The earliest sites in the project area date to the Archaic period. Two
sites may be solely Archaic, and eleven sites appear to have an Archaic
component in combination with a Late Prehistoric or Woodland period, also referred
to by some archaeologists as the Ceramic and Neo-Indian periods. Nine sites are
described on the site forms as having Late Prehistoric component based on the
presence of ceramics. Only two sites are described in more specific terms with one
referred to as having a possible Late Woodland component and the other dating to
the Marksville-Troyville and Coles Creek periods. The ceramics at this site include
Marksville and Pontchartrain Check Stamped types. Three historic sites appear to
have 19th and 20th century components, and the remainder date solely to the 20th
century. Kinds of historic sites in the project area include one house site, two
possible house sites, one dump associated with a logging camp, three artifact
scatters, one locality where a single wire nail was found, and one locality where two
historic sherds were found. During the planning phase, source points were placed
within the known boundaries of prehistoric sites 16AC31, 16AC34, 16AC39,
16AC41, 16AC43, 16AC49, 16AC55, and 16EV56 These source points were
moved to avoid these sites.

This site is in Acadia Parish and was recorded by Coastal Environments in
1974. It is described on the site form as a possible campsite dating to the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods of Louisiana prehistory. It is located on a
bench at an elevation of 10 feet above mean sea level. The nearest water
source is Bayou des Cannes. Artifacts associated with this site include lithics
and ceramics. The site has been heavily disturbed through vandalism.
According to the site form, the eligibility of this site for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places is unknown. There are no recommendations for
further work on the site form. Lisa G. Shaddox visited the site on July 9, 2008,
and she observed potholes that did not appear to be recent.
16AC19
This site is in Acadia Parish and was recorded by PBS&J in 2005. It is
described on the site form as a trash dump associated with a logging camp. It is
located on the prairie terrace approximately 2.5 meters above the surrounding
seasonally inundated floodplain of Bayou des Cannes at an elevation of 40 feet
above mean sea level. Artifacts associated with this site include bottle glass
fragments, ceramic sherds, a metal fence staple, coffee mug handle, and two
small tertiary chert flakes that suggest a possible prehistoric component. The
site has been disturbed through erosion and forestry practices, but the amount of
disturbance is not stated on the site form. According to the site form, this site is
not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. No further work
was recommended.

& Associates, Inc. in 2006. It is described on the site form as an artifact scatter
dating to the 19th and 20th centuries. It is located on the coastal plain at an
elevation of 40 feet above mean sea level. Its size is estimated as 1200 square
meters. The exact function of this site is not known. The recorders state that it
appears likely that the cultural materials associated with the access road may be
associated with secondary fill that was brought in to elevate the road above the
wetlands that surround the road. Artifacts associated with this site include glass
sherds, historic ceramics, and metal spikes. This site has been severely
disturbed. According to the site form, this site is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No further work was recommended.
16AC23
This site is in Acadia Parish and was recorded by R. Christopher Goodwin

dating to the 20th Century. It is located on the coastal plain at an elevation of 40
feet above mean sea level. Its size is estimated as 600 square meters. The
recorders believe that the artifacts recovered from this site reflect the past
disposal and distribution of domestic and architectural debris, and this activity
was concentrated in a small area along the high ground between four rice fields.
This high area also represents berms that were built to separate these inundated
fields. Artifacts associated with this site include metal nails and spikes,
miscellaneous hardware, sheet metal, glass sherds, and window glass. The
degree of disturbance is stated on the site form as low. According to the site
form, this site is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
No further work was recommended.
16AC28

DIRECTION OF RESEARCH AND RECOMMENDATIONS
No new archaeological sites were found, and no artifacts were collected
as a result of this project. Therefore, the only item curated is this report that will
be submitted to the USACE, New Orleans District. Since this project involved the
examination of source points in high probability areas by professional
archaeologists, the only recommendations were that all known sites be avoided
by the drilling operations and that all source points placed within high probability
areas were to be field inspected. These recommendations were adhered to
during this project.
