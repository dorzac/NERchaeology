AN HISTORIC BURIAL FROM YELLOWHOUSE
CANYON, LUBBOCK COUNTY
W. W. NEWCOMB,

JR.

In July, 1951, Betty Jane Dryden of Chickasha, Oklahoma,
a Girl Scout counselor, discovered some human bones eroding out of the north wall of Yellowhouse Canyon on the
Johnson Ranch below Buffalo Lake, about twelve miles east
of Lubbock, Texas (Plate 24, A, B). Her discovery was reported to Dr. Grayson E. Meade, Geologist at Texas Technological College, by Mary Ola Anderson, Field Director
of the Lubbock Girl Scout Association. Dr. Meade carefully removed the human remains, the revolver, knife, kettle, and the other cultural material associated with the
skeleton. These remains were given to the Texas Memorial
Museum and are now on exhibit on the Anthropology floor.
The skeleton is almost complete and is exceptionally well
preserved. The individual had been interred in the canyon
wall, lying on his back with knees drawn up (Plate 25, A ).
The right humerus (upper arm bone) and some bones of
the right hand and foot were missing. Being on the canyon
side of the burial these bones were washed away; other
bones were also exposed and led to the discovery. An examination of the skeleton indicated that the individual was
male, a young-adult (21-35 years old) and belonged to the
Indian (Mongoloid) division of mankind. The Indian char~cter of the skeleton is confirmed by the glass mocassin
beads, the tubular bone beads, and other Indian ornaments.
The. sex, acc()rding to the skeletal evidence, tends to be
confirmed by the fact that a revolver, knife, and saddle
bags were bliried with him. It is unlikely that this typically
male equippage would be buried with a woman. This individual was about 169.9 em. tall (or 5'7") and had a cranial
index of 75 (mesocephalic) . 1 Two views of the skull are
shown in Plate 25, B, C.
1. Stature reconstructed by using E. A. Hooton's Up From the

Ape, 1946, p. 728, formulae (e) and (f) for males, and averaging
the two results. Other measurements are: head length, 176 mm. ;
head breadth, 132 mm.; auricular height, 104 mm.; face height
(menton-nasion) 121 mm.; face breadth, 138 mm.; nose height,
55 mm. ; nose breadth, 27 mm.

Found with the skeleton was a Remington-Beals .44 caliber, cap and ball revolver, first manufactured in 1858, and
used by the United States Army (Plate 26, A). A metal cap
container was also found and fits into a fragmentary leather
pouch which was attached to the belt (Plate 26, E). The
metal belt buckle was well preserved, and is a General Service Army buckle, ordinarily worn by officers. This buckle
was first used in 1852 and until recently was worn on dress
uniforms.2 In a leather scabbard was found a badly rusted
and rotted, wooden handled, scalping or butcher knife (Plate
26, F) . Apparently a leather saddle bag had been placed over
or around the head. In a pouch of this bag was a small lump
of cinnabar (mercury ore) a red pigment much favored by
Indians for painting the face and body. This pigment was in
time deposited on the right temple and caused a red discoloration of the bone which is clearly visible today. On the
left temple is a greenish stain caused by contact of the
skl!ll with the copper or brass ornaments of the saddle
bag. Some coarse, black, typically Mongoloid hair, bound
by a cord, was also found adhering to the skull.
At the feet there were many small red, blue, and white
glass beads (Plate 25, E), and rusted cone-shaped iron tinklers (Plate 25, G), indicating that moccasins were worn.
Over the chest area were 88 nearly identical tubular bone
beads, about 2 inches long, which were worn as a breastplate consisting of four vertical rows of beads hung horizontally. Two such rows can be seen in place in Plate 25,
A, and 10 beads are seen in place on the remains of the cloth
shirt in Plate 26, D. These ornamental bone breastplates
were popular with Plains Indians in the 19th century, and
were ordinarily made from the small bones of front legs of
deer, or from turkey leg bones.
There were two ornaments cut out of sheet copper, like
that shown in Plate 27, B. The upper part is shaped somewhat like an inverted bell, while the lower part is a crescent.

National Museum, S'e ptember 28, 1954.

The specimen not illustrated has the two parts joined with
a chain-like link. Probably these ornaments were suspended
from the bottom of the tubular-bone breastplate mentioned
above.
The remnants of a bridle were found, including parts of
the leather straps and metal ornaments (Plate 27, E-J), an
iron bit (Plate 26, B) , and the copper or brass-capped ends
of the bridle straps. At the foot of the grave and slightly
higher than the other remains was a two-quart Army issue
kettle of copper or brass (Plate 25, A). Several large disks
of thin sheet copper (Plate 27, A) were probably once fastened to the saddle bag. Small copper bells also were found
in the grave.
Many other bits of metal, leather, and cloth were found ,
too fragmentary to identify, although it may be supposed
that most of them once belonged to the clothing, bridle, and
saddle bag (Plates 25, F, H; 26, C; 27, C, D, K, L, N). A
copper ring was found in place around a finger bone (Plate
25,D).
An antler flaking tool (Plate 27, M) is of interest, for it
indicates that this person was still making chipped-stone
artifacts at this date.
ANALYSIS
We can say with certainty that this man died after 1858
from the data supplied by the revolver. It is unlikely that
he died later than about 1875, since the last of the tribes
in this area were pacified by this date. We cannot say what
caused death. There are no indications from the bones that
death was caused by an enemy missile or by disease. It
is of course possible to be killed by a bullet or arrow without having any bone affected. His death seems to have been
an honorable one in that burial was careful and apparently
unhurried. It seems unlikely that an ignominious death
would be rewarded with careful burial, particularly with
the inclusion of a fairly valuable, loaded revolver.

Several possibilities are raised by the Army equipment
found with the skeleton. First, is that this man was an
Indian Scout employed by the Army. The Army throughout the nineteenth century employed friendly Indians as
scouts, in exploring the west and dealing with its inhabitants. These scouts were equipped by the Army. Up to and
including the Civil War most of these scouts were members
of eastern tribes who had been forced onto reservations
west of the Mississippi. Shawnees, Delawares, and other
tribes originally resident in the east, and Pawnees, were
among the most prominent. Another possibility is that this
individual was a member of a hostile tribe, perhaps Comanche, Kiowa, or Apache. A warrior from one of these tribes
could have taken from a captive, or from the body of a
soldier, the revolver, belt-buckle, belt, and bridle, or he
could have 'received these items following a treaty or conference with government agents. Occasionally members of
these tribes served as scouts for the Army.
Several other clues suggest that the skeleton of Yellowhouse Canyon was a Comanche or a member of some other
southern Plains tribe. First, the nature of the burial suggests
this. Wallace and Hoebel say of the Comanches, for example:
The preferred burial place was a natural cave, crevice, or a deep wash among the rocks of the highest
accessible peak, or in the head of a canyon preferably to the west of the lodge of the departed3.
The Yellowhouse burial conforms to Comanche customs
in this respect and also in the habit of placing riding gear
and other personal valuables in the grave.4 Comanches
and Kiowas frequently shot the favorite horse of a warrior
over or near the grave, but if this occurred with the Yellowhouse burial the bones would probably have been scattered
or washed away. Second, the clothing and ornaments, par3. The Comanches, Lords of the South Plains, 1952, p. 150. University of Oklahoma Press .

ticularly the bone breastplate, point to a 19th century
southern Plains Indian. The area in which the burial was
found (just off the Llano Estacada) was well within the
19th century range of the southern Plains people, particularly the Comanches. Lastly, the 17 year period during
which this individual probably died was a most hectic and
destructive one for southern Plains tribes. This span covered the turbulent years of the Civil War and the violent
aftermath in which these people were hunted down and
the survivors finally confined to reservations. Many southern Plains Indians must have died and been buried in
situations similar to the one of Yellowhouse Canyon.
Unfortunately little is known, at least in detail, of the
distinguishing physical characteristics of the various southern Plains Indians, so that the tribal affinity of the Yellowhouse burial cannot be determined by a comparison of
relevant measurements. The southern Plains Indians also
underwent a good deal of racial mixture, particularly the
Comanche, so that tribal membership is not often reflected
in the skeletal evidence. Goldstein, who made an anthropometric study of the Comanches in the early 1930's, foui\d
that only 10 percent of the tribe were "fullbloods."5 Most
of the mixture can be traced to marriage with Mexican
captives beginning before the nineteenth century. There
were probably few "pure" Comanches left by the second
half of the century. Other southern Plains people probably
underwent a similar intermixture, although perhaps less
extensive than that of the Comanches.
In summary, the burial in Yellowhouse Canyon was that
of a young adult, male Indian. He was buried sometime
after 1858 and probably before 1875. It seems most likely
that this individual was a member of a southern Plains
tribe such as the Comanche or Kiowa, who had once worked
in some capacity for the Army, or had looted the Army
equipment found with him. It is also possible that the skele5. Goldstein, M. S., 1934, "Anthropometry of the Comanches,"

An Historical Burial From Yellowhouse Canyon

ton of Yellowhouse Canyon was a member of some other
Plains tribe, or a member of one of the Eastern Apache
groups. It seems somewhat less likely that he was a member
of one of the emigrant tribes of Indians.
It is rather curious that more historic burials similar to
the one of Yellowhouse Canyon have not been found or
at least reported. In the present instance it is true that
one of the reasons for the excellent state of preservation
is the fact that bone, leather, cloth, and hair, which lay
beneath the copper and brass ornaments, became impregnated with copper salts and so were preserved. On the
other hand, it may be that historic sites or burials are
considered to be of little importance and so are ignored.
This point of view, if true, is unfortunate, since one of the
largest gaps in our knowledge is the association of late prehistoric archaeological complexes with historic tribes. Particularly in Texas the association of historic tribes with
their archaeological forerunners is often all too weak. To
narrow and close this gap more early historic sites will
have to be examined. It is of course often true, as with the
Yellowhouse burial, that an historic site or burial does
nothing to illuminate the prehistoric of protohistoric knowledge of an area, but archaeological techniques of excavation and general analysis are frequently of immense value
in shedding light on the later history and ethnography of
an area.
