ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the proposed Health Sciences Center in central
Brazos County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates
(BVRA) from January 8, 2007 through February 2, 2007. The area examined
consisted of about 358 acres. William E. Moore was the Principal Investigator, and
Edward P. Baxter was the Project Archaeologist. This project was carried out under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4384. The project area was investigated using the
pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing.
This study located one prehistoric site (41BZ164). This site is described in
this report as a scatter of lithic artifacts over a very disturbed surface.
No
diagnostic artifacts were recovered; therefore, the age of this site is not known. A
field analysis of the lithic debitage indicates that site 41BZ164 is a small occupation
area where initial tool reduction occurred. This site is not eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. No further work at this site is recommended
One historic site (41BZ89) is present in the project area. In 1989, this site
was recorded as a farmstead containing a frame house, a double-pen barn made
from hand-hewn logs and a log crib. The house was recorded during a survey for
the proposed State Highway 47 and was dated to circa 1915. Subsequent testing
suggested a late 19th century occupation (circa 1880). The house was destroyed as
a result of highway construction. The barn and crib were later demolished and
were not present at the time of this survey. No further work at this site is
recommended.
No artifacts were collected. Copies of the final report are on file at the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL),
BVRA, and the City of Bryan, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Bryan proposes to purchase a 358-acre tract of land in central
Brazos County (Figure 1) from various landowners before gifting it to the Texas
A&M University System who plans to develop the area by constructing a medical
facility currently referred to as the Health Sciences Center. The project area is
located immediately north-northeast of State Highway 47 and lies between the
intersections of State Highway 47 and Villa Maria on the west and State Highway
47 and Farm-to-Market Road 60 (Raymond Stotzer Parkway) on the east. The
northern boundary is the existing Traditions Golf and Country Club. The project
area consists of nine tracts owned by different individuals, and it is depicted on the
USGS 7.5â Chances Store topographic quadrangle (Figure 2). This topographic
map was created in 1962 and photo revised in 1980. Construction plans consist of
clearing and the addition of parking lots, roads, and buried utilities
Brazos County contains significant archaeological sites, both prehistoric and
historic, and the 358-acre tract is located in an area where prehistoric sites have
been recorded. Recognizing the potential for the presence of significant prehistoric
sites and the fact that one historic site (41BZ89) had been recorded in the project
area, the THC requested that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to
development of this tract. In order to fulfill this requirement, CSC Engineering &
Environmental Consultants, Inc. retained BVRA to conduct an archaeological
survey, which was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit 4384.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120).
Fenneman subdivides this province according to the age of the geological
formations (Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly
and situated within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an
area characterized by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that
are acid sandy loams or sands. The climate is sub humid to humid, and the
weather is considered to be predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Brazos County
is 39.21 inches. A January minimum average temperature of 42 degrees
Fahrenheit and a July maximum average temperature of 95 degrees Fahrenheit
combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:180).
The altitude varies from 200-400 feet. The project area is located on a tract of land
that is drained by Turkey Creek and its tributaries. Elevations vary from 230 feet
along the creek bottoms to 320 feet in the uplands that comprise the majority of the
project area. Water was present in Turkey Creek at the time of this survey.
Silicified (petrified) wood is very common in the project area. Numerous pieces,
large and small, were observed on the ground surface in eroded and cleared areas
throughout the project area.
Soils in the project area consist of the Zack-Boonville-Zulch mapping unit.
These are nearly level to moderately sloping, moderately deep and very deep,
loamy soils that are somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained. The
landscape in areas of this mapping unit consists of gently rolling dissected
erosional uplands and some nearly level foot slopes. Small areas of steeper soils
are adjacent to streams. The underlying material is alkaline, loamy sediment and
shales of the Easterwood Shale Member of the Yegua Formation. Most of the soils
in this mapping unit are moderately deep over this slowly weathering parent
material. Zack soils are mostly found on summits and the upper back slopes and
on breaks to streams. Typically, the surface layer is thin. It is dark brown, strongly
acid to moderately alkaline clay that has colors in shades of brown. It is underlain
by moderately alkaline, loamy sediments. Boonville soils are found on nearly level
or very gently sloping foot slopes. Typically, the surface layer is brown, slightly acid
fine sandy loam. The thickness of the surface layer is highly variable. The subsoil
is light brownish-gray, neutral clay that has red and brown mottles. The underlying
material is a mixture of alkaline gray clay that is in part colluvium and part shale.
Zulch soils are found on the lower back slopes. Typically, the surface layer is thin.
It is grayish-brown, moderately acid fine sandy loam. The subsoil is dark grayishbrown, slightly acid clay. The underlying material is brown and gray, alkaline shale
with interbedded loamy materials. The above information was taken from the Soil
Survey of Brazos County (Chervenka 2003). At the time of this survey the ground
cover in the project area varied from thick woods and dense brush (Figure 3) to
cleared areas with little vegetative cover (Figure 4). There was a clearing that was
the result of a sewer line that was constructed prior to this project (Figure 3).

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Background Research
The field survey was supplemented by an examination of site records and
other documents and reports at TARL and in the BVRA library. The records at
TARL and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for a listing of known
sites and surveys in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports
documenting work in Brazos County were reviewed in order to become familiar with
the kinds of prehistoric and historic sites known to be present in the area. The
proposed methods were discussed with THC staff archaeologist William A. Martin
prior to the field survey. BVRA was awarded antiquities permit 4384 which allowed
work to be performed on property under consideration for purchase by the City of
Bryan. Also, William A. Dickens, Ph.D. was consulted regarding his knowledge of
archaeological sites in this part of Brazos County.
Field Survey
Edward P. Baxter (Project Archaeologist) performed the field survey. The
project area was examined by means of a 100% Pedestrian Survey and shovel
testing. Shovel tests were excavated in high probability areas and randomly across
the project area. In some areas, tests were terminated at shallow depths due to the
presence of firm clay or standing water. All areas where the ground surface was
visible were checked for exposed cultural materials. Site 41BZ164 was discovered
when artifacts were observed on a disturbed surface that had been cleared of the
existing vegetation. The boundaries of this site were established by flagging
artifacts on the surface. Not one shovel test in the site area was positive in terms of
containing cultural materials. The shovel tests were approximately 30 cm x 30 cm
in size. All excavated earth was screened through quarter-inch hardware cloth.
Data obtained from shovel tests were recorded on a shovel test log, and the
approximate location of each test was plotted on the topographic quadrangle
Chances Store (Figure 5). Appendix I contains data for the 168 shovel tests dug
across the project area, and Appendix II contains data for the shovel tests dug at
sites 41BZ89 and 41BZ164. All shovel tests were backfilled after evaluation and
mapping. In all, 168 shovel tests were excavated during the survey phase of which
16 were on or around site 41BZ164. An additional 16 shovel tests were excavated
on previously recorded site 41BZ89 at the request of the THC. Lithic Analyst
William A. Dickens visited the project area to examine site 41BZ164. He conducted
a field analysis of artifacts observed on the surface and took notes to be
incorporated into his discussion of this site. This site was assigned a field number
(HSC-1) and later recorded at TARL as 41BZ164.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
A check of the records at TARL revealed that significant sites have been
recorded in the region. The project area has not been examined by a professional
archaeologist, but several relevant cultural resources investigations have been
performed in the vicinity. Three of these were performed along Turkey Creek by
BVRA (Moore 2001, 2004; Moore and Baxter 2005)
In 1987, John W. Clark of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
recorded historic site 41BZ89 during a survey of the proposed State Highway 47,
and portions of this site are in the current project area. At the time of his visit, there
was a house, a double-pen barn, a cellar, and a log crib. No prehistoric materials
were observed. Clark describes the house on the site form as a single story
structure with a Gable roof of corrugated sheet iron on the rear and a lean-to porch
across the front. The piers were made of mortared limestone and or sandstone
with some use of silicified wood fragments. He describes the barn as being made
of cut logs squared with an adze and covered with a gabled roof. Cut nails were
observed in at least one of the logs. The crib was made from round logs that had
been cut with a saw. They were square notched, and the structure was covered
with a corrugated iron gabled roof. This site is located on the highest point of the
hill above Turkey Creek. Artifacts observed on the surface include Elgin bricks,
pieces of sheet iron, white earthenware sherds, and fragments of glass. On the site
form, Clark believes this site dates to circa 1915. He also noted a dump to the
north of what he terms the âprinciple occupation area.â
Test excavations were performed at this site on October 12, 1992 and
March 10, 1993 under the direction of Clark. This investigation revealed a âhighly
predictable horizontal distribution of artifacts over the site conforming to the
Brunswick artifact patternâ as defined by South (1977:47-80), according to Clark
(Archaeological Studies Staff n.d.). In the testing report, the researchers state that
occupation at 41BZ89 apparently began in the late 1880s, when the house was
constructed, and continued until the 1950s when this site may have been used by
hunters or as a campsite for stock handlers. In all, 22 test units were excavated
across the site area. They concluded that site 41BZ89 appears typical of late 19th
century farmsteads in North America. Based on the results of the test excavations
and preliminary deed research, the researchers believe that the artifact sample
from the site (combined with the written and photo-documentation of the ruined
structures) represents adequate documentation and recordation of that portion of
site 41BZ89 within the State Highway 47 right-of-way. Because of the shallow and
predictable nature of the archaeological deposits, the fact that this site is commonly
found in this part of Texas, and the poor condition of the structures, the researchers
do not believe that this site is eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. No further work was
recommended.

In 1993, Archaeology Consultants, Inc. conducted an archaeological survey
of the proposed Bush Presidential Library Center (Moore and Warren 1993). This
study investigated 203 acres and recorded two prehistoric sites (41BZ124 and
41BZ125). Site 41BZ124 was found to be a possible single component site with
only a few flakes recovered. Historic artifacts dating to the 20th century were found
mixed with the prehistoric materials. Site 41BZ125 was found to have been
destroyed by construction of George Bush Drive. It yielded only a few flakes, one
biface, and one dart point that dates to the Archaic period. The biface and dart
point were found on the surface within the highway right-of-way. Virtually all of the
shovel tests in the site area were negative. Additional work was not recommended
at either site. This project was to the south and east of the current project area
along White Creek.
The largest archaeological survey in the area was a 945-acre tract that was
examined by BVRA prior to construction of the Traditions Golf and Country Club by
the City of Bryan (Moore 2001). This facility has been constructed and is adjacent
to the current project area just across a tributary of Turkey Creek to the north. This
study found one prehistoric site with a historic component (41BZ131) and three
sites containing only prehistoric components (41BZ132 â 41BZ134). All of the
prehistoric sites were found to be located on landforms containing sandy soils
adjacent to streams. Based on artifacts observed in a private collection and those
recovered during subsurface testing, the area had been occupied from sometime
during the Paleo-Indian period through the Late Prehistoric periods of Texas
prehistory. Paleo-Indian artifacts include Plainview, Angostura, and an Early
Stemmed type from 41BZ131. Archaic artifacts include Morrill, Pedernales,
Godley, and Gary from 41BZ131 and Carrollton from 41BZ132. The 0nly evidence
of Late Prehistoric occupation was the single Scallorn arrow point found at site
41BZ131. The only two identifiable projectile points found by BVRA were the
Carrollton point found during subsurface testing and the Morrill point found on the
surface. At site 41BZ132, a probable intact feature consisting of fire-cracked rock,
burned chert flakes, and the Carrollton dart point was destroyed by the backhoe.
This site is evidence that habitation sites containing features are present in the
area. Two sites were found in the uplands. Site BZ133 was found at an elevation
of 332 feet, and site 41BZ134 was found at an elevation of 270 feet. Neither site
produced diagnostic artifacts or features.
In 2001, William E. Moore encountered site 41BZ89 during the survey of the
Traditions Golf and Country Club. Unaware that it had been previously recorded,
Moore submitted a site form. At the time of his visit, the house had been
demolished by the recent construction of State Highway 47. The structure referred
to as a barn by Clark was viewed by Moore as a possible cabin. The log crib was
still standing. No photos were taken, no map was made, and no attempt was made
to collect or document artifacts.

In 2004, BVRA conducted an archaeological survey for the Turkey Creek
Trail project to the north and east of the current project area (Moore 2004). This
study examined approximately 10 acres, and no archaeological sites were found.
In 2004 and 2005, BVRA conducted an archaeological survey for the West
Side Facility sewer project between the confluences of Thompsonâs Creek and
Turkey Creek with the Brazos River. This study examined 61 acres and found one
prehistoric site (41BZ158).
This site is located on a sandy hill overlooking
Thompsonâs Creek. Numerous flakes were found during extensive shovel testing
and backhoe trenching. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered, and no features
were observed. Therefore, it was recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Background Research
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed that one site
(41BZ89) has been recorded in the project area. No professional survey of the
project area had been conducted. Several significant archaeological projects,
however, have been carried out nearby with three along Turkey Creek by BVRA
(see Archaeological Background above).
Field Survey
Previously recorded site 41BZ89 was visited and examined. At the time of
this study the barn and crib had been demolished. Based on an aerial photograph
taken prior to construction of State Highway 47 it was evident that the house was
within the right-of-way of the highway. Today, no evidence of this structure
remains, as the area where it was located is now part of the cut bank of State
Highway 47. The footprints of the barn and crib are evident (Figures 6 and 7), and
historic artifacts and other trash were observed scattered over the surface, although
few in number. Plain white ware and decorated ceramics, nails, pieces of tin, and
brick (kiln fired and handmade) were observed. The location of 41BZ89 as it
appears today on the topographic map Chances Store appears in III. A map
depicting the footprints of the barn and crib as they were at the time of the survey
and shovel tests excavated at the site appears as Figure 8. The cellar and dump
reported by Clark in 1993 were not observed. Today, the area is used as pasture
for cattle. This site is located in a soil type described by Chervenka (2003:95-96)
as Zack very fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes. This soil is typically found in
the uplands on summits and the upper back slopes. It consists of a fine sandy
loam over clay subsoil at a depth of about 7 to 18 inches. This soil does not flood,
and the depth to the water table is more than six feet. Sixteen shovel tests were
excavated, all of which were negative.
One newly recorded prehistoric site (41BZ164) was recorded during this
field survey. Based on a field examination of the artifacts, this site is described in
this report as a small occupation area where initial tool reduction occurred. This
site is located on the back slope of the hill below site 41BZ89 in a soil described by
Chervenka (2003:97-98) as Zack very fine sandy loam, 5 to 8 percent slopes. This
soil is found in the uplands on upper back slopes. The surface layer is a fine sandy
loam, and the subsoil is strongly acid clay that occurs between 3 and 17 inches
above the surface. This soil does not flood and runoff is rapid. At the time of this
survey, the artifacts were found to be in a cleared area where surface visibility was
excellent (see Figure 4). In addition to the land clearing, a water line traversed the
area. Rains following the clearing had washed and deflated the soil surface
revealing a scatter of lithic artifacts over an area of approximately 45 meters northsouth x 140 meters east-west. The location of 41BZ164 as it appears on the
topographic map Chances Store appears in Appendix III.

The lithic artifacts consisted of two biface fragments, six cores, one
hammerstone, and about 75 flakes. The biface fragments were in the early stage
of reduction where only the natural surface or cortex was removed and preliminary
shaping had begun. Both failed from either improper flake removal or internal
material flaws. Like the bifaces, the cores have had only large flakes removed from
portions of their surface. In all cases, some portions of the original cortical surface
remains. They were probably intended to produce large flakes that could be
modified and utilized as scrapers, flake knives, gravers, and/or perforators.
Two of the cores may have only been tested for their flaking qualities. Most
of the flakes observed include represent early reduction debris, and some of the
larger flakes could be suitable for projectile point manufacture. Flakes containing
varying amounts of cortex were observed, and some small, thin flakes without
cortex were also noted. The platforms noted included natural (cortex covered),
plain (no cortex), and a few faceted (prepared and isolated). Most of the platforms
were unlipped with a prominent swelling or bulge on their ventral surface with either
a slight bulb or no bulb present. These attributes are usually related to the use of a
hard hammer percussor (unlipped platforms with a prominent bulb) or a soft
hammer (lipped platforms and a diffuse bulb or no bulb present). Many of the
flakes, as well as some of the gravels present on the site, show evidence of
burning. A single hammerstone made of local quartzite was also noted. Battering
was present on both ends indicating the striking surface.
All of the lithic materials observed were made from local gravels and consist
of small to moderately sized cobbles that may reach six to seven inches in length,
although most are smaller. Colors include a range of opaque yellows and grays to
a few semi-translucent browns. Although the source of these gravels is not known,
there is an area less than one mile north of this site where natural gravels suitable
for lithic reduction have been observed.
Little can be said about this site except initial tool reduction was apparently a
major activity. An absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts makes it impossible to
date this site; however William A. Dickens (personal communication) believes that
the size of the bifaces may indicate occupation sometime during the Archaic period.
Due to the excellent surface visibility it is very likely that some diagnostic artifacts
have been removed by collectors. The artifacts observed on the surface are
probably no longer in their original context, having been moved about as a result of
the land clearing. This site is virtually destroyed. A site map depicting site
41BZ164 and the 16 on-site and off-site shovel tests is depicted in Figure 9.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The previously recorded historic site (41BZ89) has been destroyed, and the
newly recorded prehistoric site (41BZ164) has been severely disturbed through
land clearing. Therefore, it is recommended that construction be allowed to
proceed as planned. Should evidence of a prehistoric site or historic site not
discussed in this report be discovered, all work must stop until the situation can be
evaluated by the THC. Also, if additional acreage is added to the project area the
THC must be notified as additional survey by a professional archaeologist may be
required.
