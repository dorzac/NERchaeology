ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of the
archeological survey conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for
the Cottonwood Creek Trail Extension Project (CSJ: 0918-24-214), City of Plano, Collin
County, Texas. As the City of Plano is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, the
proposed project will require coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
prior to construction, per the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In
addition, as the project will require a Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA)
Nationwide Permit (NWP) 14 from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),
portions of the project will be subject to the provisions of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. All work conformed to 36 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800, and 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which
outline the regulations for implementing Section 106 of the NHPA and the ACT,
respectively.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any archeological sites that
could be adversely affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources
for their potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or
eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The archeological survey was conducted by archeologists Thomas Chapman and Kevin
Stone on 05 July 2017, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8091. During the IES survey,
no archeological sites were encountered within the 2.31-mile Area of Potential Effects
(APE).
No artifacts were collected as part of this survey. All records will be temporarily curated
at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL). No further work is warranted. However, if any
archeological sites, other than those documented within this report, are unearthed during
construction, the operators should stop construction activities, and immediately contact
the project environment representative to initiate coordination with the THC prior to
resuming any construction activities.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the Area of Potential Effects
(APE), environmental setting, relevant cultural background, and methodology; followed by the results of
the investigations and recommendations. This report serves as the archeological report to satisfy the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).

1.1: Introduction
As the project consultant for Halff Associates, Inc. and on behalf of the City of Plano, Integrated
Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) performed an archeological survey to locate any prehistoric or
historic-period archeological sites that could be considered potentially eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) within the
2.31-mile project corridor or APE. The trail project will occur along Cottonwood Creek between Oak
Point Park and Nature Preserve and Chaparral Road within the City of Plano, Collin County, Texas. The
APE is plotted on modern aerial photography and the Plano 7.5 Minute Series U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) Quadrangle maps (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).

1.2: Area of Potential Effects
The project corridor or APE spans 2.31 miles from the intersection of Chaparral Road and Cloverhaven
Way to Oak Point Park and Nature Preserve. The APE encompasses an approximate 6.57-acre area that
ranges in width from 20 feet to 90 feet. Engineering designs call for the construction of a 12-foot to 16foot wide concrete pathway with 2-foot shoulders that would include lighting, landscaping, and a 100-foot
long retaining wall. Two pedestrian bridges measuring 25 feet and 30 feet would also be constructed
approximately 120 feet northeast and 300 feet southeast of the Acorn Drive cul-de-sec. To construct this
trail, grading and drainage improvements would be required throughout the APE, as well as the
installation of a 6-foot by 6-foot reinforced concrete box (RCB) culvert and six 3-foot by 3-foot
reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) culverts. The RCB culvert would be located approximately 150 feet east
of Los Rios Boulevard. The northernmost RCP culvert would be located approximately 865 feet
northeast of the intersection of Bright Star Way and Oceanview Drive. Three RCP culverts would be
located approximately 510 feet, 775 feet, and 985 feet southwest of the intersection of Danbury Lane and
Oceanview Drive. A RCP culvert would be located 665 feet west of Badger Street and Abbotsford Drive.
A final RCP culvert would be located directly south of the intersection of Acorn Drive and Abbotsford
Drive.
Vertical impacts within the APE would primarily be restricted to the groundâs surface; however, the
proposed grading would reach approximately 3 to 5 feet in depth. These deeper subsurface impacts
would occur at two areas within the APE. The deepest subsurface impacts would occur east of the Acorn
Drive cul-de-sec where the 100-foot long retaining wall would be installed; however, these deeper
grading activities would occur within areas that have been significantly disturbed.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1: Environmental Setting
Climate
Collin County lies in the north-central part of the state of Texas. Annual rainfall averages between
approximately 35.01 to 42.01 inches. About half of the rain usually falls between April and May, with
July and August being the two driest months of the year. The subtropical region tends to have a relatively
mild year-round temperature with the occasional exceedingly hot and cold periods (Estaville and Earl
2008).
Topographic Setting
The USGS Plano 7.5â Quadrangle map illustrated that the APE is primarily located along the eastern
margins of a ridgeline separating Cottonwood Creek and Rowlett Creek. From the northern terminus of
the proposed trail, the alignment proceeds east within a gently sloping setting for approximately 0.45 mile
from the crest of the ridge toward Cottonwood Creek. Prior to reaching the creekâs floodplain, the
proposed trail turns to the south and parallels Cottonwood Creek for approximately 1.1 miles. Within this
stretch of the trail, the creek ranges between approximately 200 and 650 feet to the east. From this point,
the trail forks with a one segment proceeding west for approximately 0.24 mile and the other segment
proceeding to the southwest. The western segment proceeds up the slope of the ridgeline and terminates
near its apex. The southwestern segment is within a more steeply sloped setting where the ridgeline
narrows to approximately 0.25 mile wide. The southwestern trail segment is approximately 0.50 mile
long and would cross over the narrow ridge and terminate within the Rowlett Creek valley floor (see
Figure 1.2).
Geology and Soils
The APE is located within the Northern Blackland Prairie of the Texas Blackland Prairie ecoregion. This
area is distinguished from surrounding regions by the gently rolling hills and fine-textured, black clayey
soils and prairie vegetation (Griffith et al. 2004). Vertisols dominate the Texas Blackland Prairie
ecoregion and consist of high clay content that has great shrinking and swelling potential. Soils in this
area are underlain by the Austin Chalk Formation (Kau), which is characterized by massive chalk with
thin marl interbeds that have weathered upwards, forming deep vertisols largely comprised of Houston
Black Clay (McGowen et al. 1987) (Figure 2.1).
As shown by the Soil Survey of Collin County, Texas, there are six mapped soils within the APE (Hanson
and Wheeler 1969) (Table 2.1). Approximately 79.3 percent of the APE contains soils typical of upland
terrain within the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion. The remaining 20.7 percent of the APE contains
occasionally flooded soils near Cottonwood Creek. Soil data was viewed from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Web Soil
Survey 2017) (Figure 2.2).

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1: Previous Investigations
A file search within the TASA maintained by the THC identified that there are no previously recorded
archeological sites, National Register Properties, historical markers, or cemeteries located within or
directly adjacent to the APE (TASA 2017). TASA records identified that one archeological survey was
conducted that included the southern 0.54 mile of the APE. In 2009, AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC)
completed the archeological survey under ACT permit number 5123. The purpose of the survey was to
locate any archeological resources in anticipation of the development of the Oak Point Park and Nature
Preserve area. No archeological resources were identified during this survey. TASA records indicated
five previously recorded archeological sites and eight previously completed archeological surveys within
1-mile (~1,600 meters [m]) of the APE (Figure 3.1; Tables 3.1 and 3.2).

3.2: Archeological Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering archeological sites within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
Collin County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas - Sherman Sheet, the USGS topographic map, the
NRCS digital soil database for Collin County, the Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), the
National Archives and Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for
Collin County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and both past and current aerial
photography.
Prehistoric Resource Potential
Data presented within the PALM indicated that approximately 81 percent of the APE contains a moderate
to high potential for containing shallow and/or deeply buried prehistoric resources within a reasonable
context (Figure 3.2). This moderate to high potential is located within the portions of the APE in close
proximity to Cottonwood Creek and within the valley floor of Rowlett Creek. The northern 0.25 mile of
the APE features a low potential for containing shallow and deeply buried archeological resources. The
PALM indicates that low potential is present within limited portions of the APE along Chaparral Road
and near the terminus to the western fork along Los Rios Boulevard. However, through background
research, it was determined that the APE along Chaparral Road and between Bright Star Way and Acorn
Drive did not contain a reasonable context and that the potential has been reduced to a low to negligible
level.
Historic-Period Resource Potential
Historic-period resources within North-Central Texas are primarily related to farmsteads, houses, and
associated outbuildings and structures that date from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Typically,
these types of resources are located along old roadways, but can be located along railroads, creeks, and
open pastures. Although determining the presence of the earliest of these buildings and structures were
problematic, thorough and accurate maps depicting these features were widely available post-1920.
Historical maps indicated that a historic-period dwelling and farmstead were located directly adjacent to
and within the southwestern fork of the trail approximately 0.19 mile north of the terminus at Los Rios
Boulevard. Between 1982 and 1995, the domestic structure was demolished and the land has since been
left undeveloped. Historical maps indicated that the remaining portion of the APE was void of historicperiod resources prior to 1930. This was visually confirmed through historical aerial photography from
1953 and modern aerial interpretations. As such, it was determined that the APE contains a moderate to
high potential for containing historic-period archeological resources within proximity to those identified
through background research. While these areas may have moderate to high potential, erosion, prolonged
plowing, modern construction, and other minor disturbances associated with agricultural land use would
have affected the cultural integrity of any historic-period archeological site located within the proposed
APE.

METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory for the archeological survey of the Cottonwood Creek Trail Project was
conducted on 05 July 2017. The methods and density of excavating shovel tests met the minimum
requirements for field operations stipulated by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for
Texas. Prior to field work, the IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records search to
determine what archeological sites have been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile radius of the
APE. This information was detailed in Chapter 3. Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological,
geological, soils data, as well as, historical and recent topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1: Survey Methods
The 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey consisted of a careful examination of the ground surface and
existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. The survey consisted
of a single transect scheme, which was implemented across the entire APE. Areas displaying high levels
of disturbance were photographed to document the lack of potential for intact archeological deposits.
Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel test records.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this
reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in feet or miles within this
report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in meters or centimeters, unless artifact
diagnostic elements must be presented within Imperial unit measurements.

4.2: Shovel Testing
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to 60 centimeters below
surface (cmbs) or the bottom of culturally sterile deposits, whichever was encountered first, unless
otherwise specified. Each shovel test was 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and was hand excavated in
natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using Â¼-inch
hardware cloth to test for the presences of buried cultural material. All tests were recorded on maps and
plotted using hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of
each test on standardized shovel test forms. According to the Archeological Survey Standards of Texas,
for linear projects displaying little to no disturbance, 16 shovel tests should be excavated per mile per
transect. As such, a 2.31-mile project corridor will require 37 shovel tests to be excavated per transect.
However, shovel test numbers varied based on the amount of disturbance, surface exposure, exposed
bedrock or culturally sterile soil, ground visibility, steep slopes present within the APE, or if
archeological site(s) are encountered. All positive shovel tests, archeological features, and other site data
will be geospatially recorded using a Trimble Geo XT hand-held GPS unit.

4.3: Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be
temporarily curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and
photographs will be organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

RESULTS
During the pedestrian survey, no archeological sites were encountered within the 6.57-acre APE. Shovel
test unit locations are illustrated in Figure 5.1, and a photograph location map and photographs are
located in Appendix A.

5.1: Archeological Survey
Past Ground Disturbances
During the background review, it was determined that ground-disturbing activities have transpired within
the APE since the mid-20th century that have pertained to land use, transportation development, and
residential development. Historical aerial photography indicated that the majority of APE was located
within an agricultural field setting as early as 1953. Erosional scars were visible within and surrounding
the APE between Acorn Drive and Morton Vale Road from 1953 to present day. The most widespread
and intensive ground disturbances were associated with residential development, which began in 2008
between Bright Star Way and Acorn Drive. The eastbound lane of Chaparral Road was constructed
between 2009 and 2011. During this construction project, an approximate 0.45 mile portion of the APE
paralleling Chaparral Road was heavily disturbed.
General Survey Observations
The APE was located within a varied environment that ranged from mixed woods and agricultural fields
to maintained grass fields (Attachment A, Photograph 1 through 15). The topography within the APE
was primarily minimally sloped with few instances of steeply-banked drainage ditches (Attachment A,
Photograph 15). Many portions of the APE exhibited clear signs of modification of past groundwork
related to transportation development, stormwater management, utilities development, and transportation
development. Overall, the majority of the APE was located within maintained areas that are sporadically
mowed and had been previously graded. The few portions of the APE located within and surrounding the
mixed woods setting had avoided significant ground disturbances.
Field investigations verified the past disturbances observed through background research and documented
that a large portion of the APE has been affected by past ground disturbances that would have impacted
buried cultural deposits (Figure 5.2). However, as the exact degree of disturbance was unknown, shovel
testing was conducted through the APE.
Shovel Testing
During the pedestrian survey, 37 negative shovel tests were excavated throughout the APE (see Figure
5.1). Shovel testing was conducted within portions of the APE with the potential of containing buried
cultural deposits and to verify areas that were perceived to have been previously disturbed. Shovel tests
were terminated between 35 to 50 cmbs due to the vertical limits of the proposed APE, observed
disturbance, and the presence of culturally sterile soil.
Survey transects were orientated along the APE and shovel testing was performed at approximately 100
m intervals. In addition to shovel testing, subsurface exposures including animal burrows and areas with
high ground visibility were examined. Shovel testing revealed a soil profiled that transitioned from a clay
loam within the northern portion of the APE to clay within the remaining portions of the APE. Soils
ranged from very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) to dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/3) that were overlaid
on top of brown (10YR 4/3) soil.
While frequently flooded soils were identified during the background review, shovel testing and cutbank
observations, illustrated that the APE did not contain any potential for deeply buried archeological sites.
Therefore, it was determined that backhoe trenching was not be required. No archeological sites were
encountered during the intensive pedestrian survey.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Background research determined that portions of the APE contained a high potential for buried
archeological sites. However, during the pedestrian survey, 37 negative shovel tests were excavated
within the 6.57-acre APE and no archeological sites were encountered. Field investigations determined
that there was no potential for deeply buried archeological sites and did not require backhoe trenching.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the Cottonwood Creek Trail Extension Project be
permitted to continue without the need for further archeological investigations. However, if any
archeological sites are unearthed during construction, the operators should stop construction activities
immediately in those areas. The project environmental consultant should then be contacted to initiate
further consultation with the THC prior to resuming construction activities.
