ABSTRACT
On May 28, 2008, Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) performed
a cultural resources survey at the site of the 50-acre Old Orchard Park in central
Angelina County for the City of Diboll under antiquities permit 4931. The project
area was investigated by backhoe trenching. Four backhoe trenches revealed a
sandy loam that varied in depth from 30 cm to 70 cm. Below this was sandy clay
and clay that became wetter as the trenches approached the water table,
especially in the two trenches nearest the creek. No archaeological sites were
found, no artifacts were collected, and it is recommended that construction be
allowed to proceed as planned. Copies of the final report are on file at the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL),
BVRA, and the City of Diboll.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Diboll plans to make improvements to an existing city park on
a 50-acre site in central Angelina County, Texas (Figure 1). The existing park
contains ball fields, a pavilion, volleyball court, basketball pavilion, lake, splash
park, tennis courts, rest rooms, and a hike and bike trail. Planned improvements
include an amphitheater, xeriscape garden, playground, an increase in the size
of the lake and the addition of a pier and boardwalk, and two pavilions. Most of
these improvements will involve little subsurface disturbance with the exception
being the increase in the size of the lake. Because of the proximity of the project
area to White Oak Creek, an archaeological survey was recommended by the
THC. In order to comply with this request, the City of Diboll retained BVRA to
survey the area. This project was performed under Antiquities Permit 4931 with
William E. Moore the Principal Investigator and supervisor of field activities. The
project area is depicted on the topographic quadrangle Diboll, Texas (3194-224)
(Figure 2).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The following general discussion was taken from the Soil Survey of
Angelina County, Dolezel (1988:1-4). Angelina County is located in the central
part of East Texas. The northern and southern parts of the county have a
dendritic drainage system with many large streams. Two rivers, Neches and
Angelina, drain the county. Elevation ranges from about 100 feet in the south
near the Neches River to about 460 feet in the northern part of the county.
Angelina County is in the East Texas Timberlands Land Resource Area and
forest products are a major part of the local economy. Soils in this area formed
mainly under forest vegetation in a humid environment, and most are light in
color and low in natural fertility. Nearly level areas are often wet, and moderately
steep-to-steep areas tend to erode easily. The county has long, hot summers
because of moist tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico persistently covers the area.
Winters are cool and fairly short. Rainfall is fairly heavy throughout the year, and
prolonged droughts are rare. The total annual precipitation is 41 inches. Of this,
21 inches (50%) usually falls in April through September. In winter, the average
temperature is 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and the average daily minimum
temperature is 39 degrees. In summer, the average temperature is 82 degrees,
and the average daily maximum temperature is 93 degrees.
According to the soil survey (Dolezel 1988:Sheet 27), that part of the
project area where the city park is located is in Koury loam, frequently flooded
(Kp). According to Dolezel (198845), âThis is a deep soil found on nearly level
bottom lands along small streams and creeks, mainly south of Lufkin.â The soil
survey does not state a depth at which clay typically occurs, but it does say that
loam exists from the surface to a depth of 45 inches in some cases. This soil is
moderately well drained and moderately slowly permeable. The available water
capacity is high, and runoff is slow. Flooding generally occurs annually, although
these events may be for a brief duration. During the cool season, the water table
is at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 feet.
At the time of this survey the project area was divided into two recreation
areas. Most of the fifty acres has been developed as a golf course, and the rest
of the tract is a city park with various improvements (see Introduction above).
The undisturbed areas are covered with well-mowed grass.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern
Planning Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Angelina
County is situated within the Northeast Texas archeological study region. In
1985, according to a statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical
Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985:107), Angelina County contained 52 recorded
sites. In 1985, 1 site in the county had been excavated, 21 had been tested by
hand, 1 had been tested by machine, 30 sites had been dug by collectors, and
46 had been surface collected. Nine recorded prehistoric sites in the county
were listed as Archaic, and 41 sites were listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et
al. 1985:108). Five sites contained burials.
In 1991, an evaluation was made of significant sites in the Northeast
Texas Archeological Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table 2.1.1). At this
time Angelina County contained 121 recorded prehistoric sites; of this number 19
were listed as not significant, 67 as unknown significance, 35 as probably
significant, and 22 as significant. Today, the number of sites in the county
exceeds 190.
The archaeological significance of Angelina County is partially reflected in
the following statistics. In 1993, the county contained the second highest number
of important hunter-gatherer sites in Northeast Texas (n=3) (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993:Figure 2.3.3) and also contained at least 13 important Late
Caddoan sites (n=13) (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 2.5.2). Unfortunately,
there are major forces that continue to threaten the integrity of archaeological
sites in Angelina County. These include population growth (City of Lufkin and
surrounding area), highway construction, surface lignite mining, Sam Rayburn
Reservoir (formerly McGee Bend), and the lumbering industry.
Although private contract archaeology firms have played a part, most of
the archaeological sites known to exist in Angelina County have been identified
by surveys associated with reservoir construction and in-house projects by
National Forest personnel. The earliest archaeological research in the area was
performed in the late 1930s and early 1940s by researchers from The University
of Texas at Austin. At that time prehistoric cemeteries and mound sites were
considered to be of primary importance. From the late 1940s until the mid
1970s, most of the archaeological research in East Texas was carried out in
connection with reservoir construction. In 1948, Robert L. Stephenson published
the results of his work at the proposed McGee Bend Reservoir in Angelina,
Jasper, Nacogdoches, Sabine, and San Augustine counties (Stephenson 1948a,
1948b). At the time, this was the only major archaeological investigation in the
county performed by a professional archaeologist in a systematic manner.

In the 1970s, Ross Fields (1979) presented an overview of the cultural
resources of the Davy Crockett, Sam Houston, Angelina, and Sabine National
Forests of Texas. This document provides a brief discussion of all sites in each
forest, and 23 sites in Angelina County are mentioned. Another important
document for this area is a cultural resource overview of the National Forests in
Texas by John Ippolito (1983). Of particular relevance to this project is Ippolito's
Figure 21 entitled "Drainage Systems & Probability Zones, Angelina National
Forest, Texas."
Although no part of the project area is within the Angelina National Forest,
John Ippolito's figure covers areas within 10 miles of the City of Lufkin. He
considers the Neches and Angelina rivers to be high probability areas with
several streams in the county listed as medium probability areas. According to
Ippolito (personal communication), there are several drainages in the county
such as Hurricane Creek and Biloxi Creek that should be considered to be
medium to high probability areas. Ephemeral streams such as those in the
current project area are viewed by Ippolito as low probability areas.
A check of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas revealed one previous
survey in the vicinity of the current project area. This small area survey was
performed for the United States Department of Agriculture, Rural Development.
There is no information on the Atlas that documents the size of the project area,
name of investigating firm, or date of survey. This area is approximately 452
meters southwest of the current project area.
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Angelina County, especially when numerous contract reports are
available. The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et
al. 1985), the planning document published by the THC (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993), and other reports cited above for more detailed information regarding the
archaeology of Angelina County.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the Archeological Sites Atlas revealed that there are no
previously recorded sites in the project area. Two linear surveys were performed
by archaeologists from the Texas Department of Water Resources (TDWR) in
1981 and 1982. The first survey is outside the boundaries of Old Orchard Park.
It was examined by Daniel E. Fox in 1981 for a proposed interceptor pipeline.
The route was changed, and W. Hayden Whitsett examined the new route in
1982. According to the report by Whitsett (1983), most of the area investigated
was immediately adjacent to the creek bed, âan area cut by numerous small
meander scars and tributary streams that offers few potential occupation areas.â
At the time of this survey, this report was not on file at TARL. However, copies of
both reports were made available to BVRA by Christopher Jurgens at the Texas
Water Development Board, and they are now at TARL.

METHODS
This investigation was performed on May 28, 2008. Backhoe Trenches
were excavated in areas planned for development and in two areas near the
creek (Figure 3). Samples of dirt from each backhoe bucket were screened
using Â¼ inch hardware cloth and recorded on a log (Appendix I). In all, four
backhoe trenches were excavated in the project area. All tests were terminated
when clay or ground water was encountered. The trenches ranged in depth from
1.5 meters to 1.8 meters. A profile of each trench was made in the field
(Appendix II). Figure 4 illustrates the excavation of Backhoe Trench 1 at the site
of the proposed amphitheatre. The project was also documented by digital
photography. Not all areas proposed for development were examined. A
discussion of each area is presented below.
Amphitheater
The City plans to build this facility in a previously undisturbed area. This
will be an above ground structure. The only ground disturbance will be some
pushing to level the surface. One backhoe trench (BT 4) was dug in this area.
The dimensions for this trench are presented in Appendix I, and the results are
presented in the Results and Conclusions section of this report.
Handicapped Pier and Boardwalk
The City plans to build the piers and boardwalk adjacent to an existing
lake. This will be an above ground structure except for the supports that will be
placed in holes. No backhoe trenches were dug in this area.
Lake Improvements
The City plans to enlarge the lake by digging to a depth of 10 feet in an
area 50 feet x 200 feet. No backhoe trench was dug in this area because the
first trench (BT 1) was dug in the vicinity where the soccer fields are proposed.
Pavilions
The City plans to construct two pavilions that will be 40 feet x 60 feet in
size. These will be above ground structures. No backhoe trench was dug in this
area because the area had been previously disturbed when a swimming pool
was built in the past. The pool is gone, and the area is currently being used as a
splash park.

Playground
The City plans to build a playground adjacent to an existing pavilion.
When finished, this will be a grassy area with playground equipment. Very little
subsurface disturbance will result from the construction of this facility. No
backhoe trench was dug in this area due to an existing gas line.
Soccer Field
The City plans to construct one soccer field south of the existing lake and
west of the existing tennis courts and parking areas. This will be an above
ground facility with no storm drains. One backhoe trench (BT 1) was dug in this
area. The dimensions for this trench are presented in Appendix I, and the results
are presented in the Results and Conclusions section of this report.

10

Xeriscape Garden
The City plans to construct a small garden (20 feet x 40 feet) in an
undisturbed area adjacent to the park road. The only subsurface disturbance will
be tilling for the garden. No backhoe trench was dug in this area.
Two additional backhoe trenches (BT 2 and BT 3) were excavated. They
were dug in undisturbed areas near the creek. These areas were selected
because of their proximity to this stream. The dimensions for these trenches are
presented in Appendix I, and the results are presented in the Results and
Conclusions section of this report. No trenches were excavated on the west side
of the creek because the area was thickly wooded.

11

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at TARL revealed that no previously recorded sites are
present within any portion of the project area as currently defined. A review of
the literature revealed that significant prehistoric and historic sites are present in
Angelina County. Four backhoe trenches in the project area revealed a variable
depth of sandy loam between 30 cm and 1 m below the existing ground surface.
Two previous surveys were conducted in the area with one passing through the
park. These investigations were negative, and the area was viewed as an
unlikely setting for an archaeological site, mainly because of the small meander
scars and tributary streams that, according to the previous researchers, âoffers
few potential occupation areas.â The shallow water table in cool weather is
viewed by BVRA as an indication that deeply buried sites are not likely to exist
unless prehistoric groups were present in times of warmer weather. Most of 50Â­
acre park is being used as a golf course. The remainder is a city park with a few
scattered undisturbed areas. This survey was conducted according to the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission,
Archeology Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the absence of archaeological sites in the project area, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always
possible that archaeological sites are missed during any archaeological survey.
Should evidence of a prehistoric or historic site in the project area be discovered
during construction, all work in this area should cease immediately until the
Texas Historical Commission can evaluate the situation. This study followed the
minimum survey standards
