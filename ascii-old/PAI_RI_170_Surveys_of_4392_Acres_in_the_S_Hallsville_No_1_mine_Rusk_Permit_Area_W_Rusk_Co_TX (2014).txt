ABSTRACT
Personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted archeological and historical resources
surveys within 4,392 acres of land in Area W of the Sabine Mine’s Hallsville No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit
in Rusk County, Texas, in 2012. The archeological survey resulted in the discovery and documentation
of 66 previously unrecorded sites. Of the total, 33 are prehistoric Native American sites, 22 are
historic sites, and 11 are both prehistoric and historic. Thirty-seven of the prehistoric components
are lithic scatters, and 7 have both lithic and ceramic artifacts. Of the 33 historic components, 30 are
farmsteads or probable farmsteads, 1 is a barn, 1 is a roadway, and 1 is a cemetery. The historical
resources survey documented 67 historic-age resources consisting of 41 domestic, 16 agricultural, 6
industrial, 2 religious, 1 funerary, and 1 transportation property types constructed between about
1878 and 2000.
Eight archeological sites with prehistoric components (41RK674, 41RK680, 41RK693,
41RK695, 41RK703, 41RK704, 41RK707, and 41RK729) are judged to be potentially eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D but would need additional
investigation for complete eligibility assessments. This additional investigation would involve
archeological testing to more fully gauge their age, content, and integrity. The other 36 prehistoric
components are ineligible for National Register listing and do not warrant further work. All 33 historic
components are considered ineligible for National Register listing; no further work is recommended
at them, although the single historic cemetery (41RK724) is protected from disturbance by state
laws. None of the 67 historic-age resources are eligible for listing in the National Register. Further,
no potential historic districts were identified in the study area. No further work is recommended
for historical resources.

INTRODUCTION, PROJECT SETTING,
AND METHODOLOGY

1

This report details the results of archeological and historical investigations conducted
for North American Coal–Sabine Mine on ca.
4,392 acres in Area W of the South Hallsville
No. 1 Mine–Rusk Permit in northeastern Rusk
County, Texas. The total Rusk Permit area
encompasses about 20,380 acres south of the
Sabine River in northeastern Rusk County and
northwestern Panola County; the current project area occupies the central part of the permit
area (Figure 1.1). Field investigations were
conducted between February and August 2012
and consisted of surveys for archeological and
historical resources. The archeological survey
resulted in the discovery and documentation of
66 previously unrecorded sites. Of the total, 33
are prehistoric Native American sites, 22 are
historic sites, and 11 are both prehistoric and
historic. Hence, there are 44 prehistoric components and 33 historic components. Thirty-seven
of the prehistoric components are lithic scatters,
and 7 have both lithic and ceramic artifacts. Of
the 33 historic components, 30 are farmsteads or
probable farmsteads, 1 is a barn, 1 is a roadway,
and 1 is a cemetery. The historical resources
survey documented 67 historic-age resources
consisting of 41 domestic, 16 agricultural, 6
industrial, 2 religious, 1 funerary, and 1 transportation property types constructed between
about 1878 and 2000.
The work was done to assist North
American Coal–Sabine Mine in complying
with the requirements of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (as
amended) and the requirements of the Railroad
Commission of Texas. The remainder of this
chapter describes the setting and location of
the project area and discusses the methodology

applied in the present investigations. Chapter 2
summarizes previous cultural resource investigations near the project area and provides archeological and historical background information.
Chapter 3 describes the project area. Chapters
4 and 5 present the results of the archeological
and historical resources surveys. The appendix
contains forms completed in documenting the
historical resources.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The region has a humid subtropical climate.
The average winter temperature is 46ºF, and
the average summer temperature is 81ºF. Total
annual precipitation is 45–50 inches and falls
primarily between April and October. Average
annual snowfall is 1.0–1.5 inches (Griffith
2000:10; Orton 1975). The first freeze is typically
in late November, and the last freeze is typically in mid to late March, providing an average
growing season of 240–245 days.
The project area is within the West Gulf
Coastal Plain of the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province (Fennemann 1938). Surface
geomorphology of the Rusk Permit area is
characterized by floodplains, rolling dissected
Pleistocene terrace remnants, valley walls,
and rolling uplands dissected by small tributary streams. Subsurface geological units are
Tertiary in age and consist of the Wilcox Group
(undivided) overlain in areas by the Carrizo
Sand (Henry and Basciano 1979:2). Capping
these formations in places are alluvial deposits
from the Sabine River and its tributaries, such
as Cherokee Bayou. The Rusk Permit area is
within a geological structure referred to as the
Sabine Uplift. The Sabine Uplift region in Rusk

and Panola Counties represents some of the
region’s best sources of lignite, having some of
the thickest and most-continuous seams (Kaiser
et al. 1980). Alluvial sands and muds deposited
by ancient river systems that meandered across
flat coastal plains during the Tertiary comprise
the Wilcox Group (Fisher and McGowan 1967).
The depositional environment of the Sabine
Uplift and the Wilcox Group was a transitional
zone between Tertiary alluvial and deltaic plains
(Kaiser et al. 1980).

The landscape variability of the project area
creates some local variations in flora and fauna
between floodplain and upland communities. The
general characteristics of these communities are
briefly discussed here. The project area is within
the Piney Woods region of northeast Texas,
where shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), loblolly
pine (P. taeda), and mixed hardwoods including
various oaks and black hickory (Carya texana)
dominate the uplands. Floodplain and bottomland settings are characterized by hardwood

stands that include sweetgum (Liquidambar
styraciflua), American elm (Ulmus americana),
and bald cypress (Taxodium distichum).
The plant and animal communities observed today have been altered by historic and
modern land use practices. Since the 1830s,
native hardwood and pine forests have been
selectively altered by cutting and recutting to
clear fields for planting and harvest timber. In
some areas, filling of sloughs, plowing, and leveling have also modified the natural topography
(Clark and Ivey 1974:7–8).
The Rusk Permit area can be subdivided
generally into upland pine/mixed hardwood,
pastureland, and floodplain floral communities
(Kotter et al. 1992:7–8). Each of these has a
dominant overstory and understory (Table 1.1).
Floodplain forests of mixed hardwoods dominate the northern part of area, with the limited
higher elevations supporting a mix of pines and
hardwoods. Much of the central and southern
portions of the project area have been cleared of
native pine and hardwood forests for agriculture
and livestock grazing. Mixed hardwoods still are
predominant along the slopes and channels of
streams and creeks.

The Rusk Permit project area is in the
northwestern section of the Austroriparian
biotic province (Blair 1950). Most of the animal
species characteristic of the Piney Woods
and the Austroriparian province are adapted
primarily to woodland and aquatic habitats.
According to Blair (1950:99), approximately
47 mammal species, 29 species of snakes, 10
lizard species, 2 species of land turtles, and
18 urodeles typically occur in this province in
Texas. A few of the more common mammals are
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole
(Scalopus aquaticus), eastern pipistrelle bat
(Pipistrellus subflavus), red bat (Lasurius borealis), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), eastern gray
squirrel (S. carolinensis), Baird’s pocket gopher
(Geomys breviceps), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon
hispidus), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit (S. aquaticus). Other
important mammals include raccoon (Procyon
lotor), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), beaver (Castor canadensis), muskrat
(Ondatra zibethicus), and mink (Mustela vison).
Black bear (Ursus americanus) was common in
northeastern Texas into the early part of the
twentieth century.

uplands and flow north to Cherokee Bayou; four
extend well back from the valley wall. Only the
westernmost of these, Watt Creek, has been
named (Figures 1.2 and 1.3).
The permit boundary encompassing the
current project area stretches over an area that
is up to 7.2 km northwest-southeast by 4.0 km
northeast-southwest, bounded by the railroad
between Longview and Tatum on the northeast and State Highway 149 on the southwest.
Cherokee Bayou flows into the Sabine River

The current project area is immediately
south of Cherokee Bayou and northwest of the
town of Tatum. Cherokee Bayou flows from
west to east through the north part of the area,
and thus much of the land there is low-lying
floodplain. Moving south from the floodplain,
the central and southern parts of the project
area consist of Pleistocene terrace deposits and
Eocene uplands. At least six streams incise the

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
The valley wall south of Cherokee Bayou
abruptly rises in some places from 250 to 310 ft
above mean sea level over distances of only
120 m to a series of prominent interfluves along
the top of the valley wall, separated by small
unnamed streams that flow north. Principal
soils associated with the valley wall and higher
bluffs overlooking the floodplain are Kirvin
fine sandy loam and Tenaha loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000). Both soils are characteristic of
steep to moderately steep slopes and convex side
slopes, typically supporting native pines and
upland hardwood species. These soils overlap up
onto the shoulders and summits of many of the
upland interfluves along the valley wall.
The uplands extend ca. 5.0 to 5.5 km southeast of the Cherokee Bayou floodplain to the
south edge of the project area near Tatum and
are mapped as Eocene Carrizo Sand capping
the Eocene Wilcox Group (undivided) (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1975). A number of different
soils are mapped in the uplands: Betis loamy fine
sand, Bowie very fine sandy loam, Darco loamy
fine sand, Gallime-Alazan complex, Kirvin fine
sandy loam, Kirvin soils graded, Latex very fine
sandy loam, Lilbert loamy fine sand, and Rentzel
loamy fine sand (Griffith 2000). All of these are
deep, excessively to well-drained, moderately
permeable sandy upland soils. By the late
1930s, much of this area had been cleared and
was under cultivation, with the northern edge
being a patchwork of forested and cleared areas.
Currently, some areas that have been allowed to
revert to forest, but cleared pasturelands still account for about half of the total upland acreage.

beyond the eastern boundary of the project
area. Floodplain topography is characterized by
numerous sloughs, flood chutes, backswamps,
and small abandoned channels of the bayou.
Floodplain soils are dominated by Laneville
loam, Owentown fine sandy loam, and Mattex
clay loam (along stream channels). Each of
these soils, which formed in clayey and loamy
alluvium, is deep, moderately well drained, and
slowly permeable (Griffith 2000). Most of the
floodplain soils are partially hydric, meaning
that the upper part of the soil profile is sufficiently saturated to create anerobic conditions
for parts of the year. Such soils are characteristic
of wetland areas. Except for an area of floodplain
on the northwest side, much of this part of the
project area is densely wooded. Historical aerial
photographs dating to the 1930s indicate that
this has been the case for some time. An 1863
map labels the entire project area as “oak, hickory, blackjack, with brush” and depicts Cherokee
Bayou as heavily wooded along its entire course
(Von Rosenberg 1863). In the center of the
floodplain within the project area, the current
USGS topographic map has two areas labeled
“Submerged Swamp.”
Remnants of Pleistocene terraces are limited to two areas between the existing floodplain
and the south valley wall (Figure 1.4). One
area is in the central part, and the other is on
the eastern edge of the survey area and is a
continuation of a large terrace system to the
east. Both are remnants of ancient terraces of
the Sabine River. The former is an irregularly
shaped area roughly 0.9 km northwest-southeast and 0.2 km southwest-northeast. The latter
extends about 0.9 km north-south and 2.1 km
northwest-southeast. Each area is characterized
by gently downsloping terrain toward Cherokee
Bayou with interfluve ridges and toeslopes
created by wet-weather drainages. The terrace
remnants appear to mantle the lower toeslopes
of the southern valley wall. Soils on the terraces
are Laneville loam, Latex very fine sandy loam,
Owentown fine sandy loam, Sawlit-Sawtown
complex, and Woodtell loam. These soils are
moderately well-drained and slowly permeable
(Griffith 2000). As of the 1930s, much of the
terraces were still wooded like the floodplain to
the north, but they have been selectively thinned
in the past and now support a mix of loblolly
and shortleaf pines and hardwoods with a fairly
dense understory in some areas.

METHODOLOGY
Archeological Survey
Design of the Survey
The design of the archeological survey,
which was based on the results of survey of
Area V to the east (Dockall et al. 2010) and the
expected distribution of prehistoric and historic sites, called for pedestrian survey of about
4,800 acres. This included all lands within the
life-of-mine disturbance boundary within the
central part of the Rusk Permit (most of which
will be in Area W), plus 114 acres along the
southeast edge and about 145 acres in three
parcels on the north side that are outside the

disturbance boundary but within the permit
area. The 114 acres were added because the disturbance and permit area boundaries are close to
one another, and it made sense to include more
land than less, given the potential for future
changes in the disturbance boundary here.
The 145 acres were added because they are on
landforms that were considered likely to contain
sites and that are partly within the life-of-mine
disturbance boundary and partly outside of it;
including that acreage would make it easier to
document and assess sites there. The remaining
645 acres within the central part of the permit
area but outside the life-of-mine disturbance

boundary are at the north edge along and north
of Cherokee Bayou (see Figure 1.1); these lands
were not surveyed, since it is very unlikely mine
plans will change to include disturbance there.
Ultimately, about 400 acres originally slated for
survey were excluded, bringing the total area
covered to 4,392. The excluded acreage is at the
south end, where substantial residential development has occurred in recent years; given the
amount of development, it is unlikely this area
will be disturbed by mining.
In a departure from the design of the survey
of the Rusk Permit Area V to the east, where
uplands considered to have a low potential for
7

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
and hence clearly warranted pedestrian survey
and intensive shovel testing. Some of these areas
were evident on USGS topographic maps, but
others had to be identified by pedestrian survey
through dense brush and around swampy flooded areas. It was projected that sites of all ages
and types could be present, including Caddo
residential sites (the Hudnall-Pirtle site is in
a similar setting just northeast of the current
study area). These landforms offered easy access
to a rich variety of subsistence resources and
dependable water supplies via the watercourses and sloughs in the surrounding lowlands.
Depending on the ages of these landforms, it
was probable that they could contain sites with
multiple stratified components.
Although similar predictions had been
made for the Sabine River floodplain portion of
the Area V project to the east, that floodplain,
which is generally flat and featureless, turned
out to have a low site density. Once survey began
in Area W, it became clear that the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain is different, with numerous
small rises and ridges surrounded by lower inundated terrain, such that the likelihood of Native
American sites is higher. The differences in
topography between them may be due to the frequency and intensity of flooding, which probably
is a function partly of drainage basin size. The
Sabine River upstream from the Rusk Permit
drains about 3,500 mi2, while Cherokee Bayou
drains only 184 mi2 (Texas Water Commission
1962). Hence, flooding of the latter requires
more-localized rainfall, while the Sabine River
can flood as a result of more-distant weather
events. This may have made high spots on the
Cherokee Bayou floodplain more attractive and
useful for prehistoric occupation or resource
procurement activities.
The second area considered to have a high
potential for Native American sites consists of
the interfluves along the valley wall overlooking
or fronting the floodplain of Cherokee Bayou.
This setting was judged to have a high potential
for sites because it would have offered ready
access to both lowland and upland resources.
The streams that drain into the floodplain below
the valley wall would have provided dependable
water sources. Sites of all ages and types could be
present, although Caddo residential sites were
judged less likely given the presence of lands
better suited to agriculture on the floodplain to
the north.

sites saw only sample survey, this project called
for 100 percent coverage. The reasons for this
change are that (1) the entire northern third
of the project area, along Cherokee Bayou and
the south valley wall, was judged to have a high
potential for Native American sites, with the uplands to the south having a moderate potential
because of the number of small north-flowing
tributaries, and (2) historic sites were considered
likely everywhere except the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain. Hence, there were no large areas
where sites were so unlikely that sample survey
made sense.
As in Area V, Caddo sites were considered
likely because of the presence of such sites not
far away at Martin Lake and Oak Hill Mine to
the south and southwest, and because of the
proximity of the study area to the following
Caddo mound and village sites: the Early Caddo
Hudnall-Pirtle site (41RK4), which lies at the
northeast edge of Area W; the Middle to Late
Caddo Pine Tree Mound site (41HS15), which
is about 18 km northeast of the project area;
and the probable Middle to Late Caddo Lane
Mitchell site (41HS4/233), which is about 6 km
northeast of the present project area. As in
Area V, it was predicted that most of the Caddo
sites in the project area would be farmsteads,
but larger villages were considered possible as
well, with both kinds of sites likely to contain
cemeteries. Unknown Caddo mound sites also
were considered possible near Cherokee Bayou,
given the presence of the Hudnall-Pirtle site
nearby. Other expected site types included
special-purpose campsites and extractive or
processing locations used by the Caddo, as well
as during earlier periods (Middle to Late Archaic
and Woodland). With the Hasinai Trace passing
to the east of this study area and the possibility
that the Nadacao Caddo remained on Cherokee
Bayou until 1790, historic Caddo villages and
cemeteries also were judged likely. Sites occupied by non-Caddo Native American groups were
considered possible as well, given that many
such displaced groups were in the region in the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Several parts of the project area were considered to have the greatest potential for Native
American archeological sites. This included
the higher topography of the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain. Although subject to periodic inundation, these elevated landforms are less prone to
flooding than the surrounding floodplain areas
8

Chapter 1: Introduction, Project Setting, and Methodology
The 1938 Rusk County road map cannot be
georeferenced well but is informative in that it
indicates areas of heavier settlement and many
county roads that are still there today (Figure
1.7). Settlement and road networks were densest
in the southern and eastern parts of the area,
with very little apparent use of the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain except along the road that
paralleled the railroad tracks on the northeast
edge. Flanagan was along these tracks, mostly
at site 41RK555 on the northeast side in Rusk
Permit Area V (Dockall et al. 2010:136–140).
Among the buildings scattered across the eastern part of the project area were a church and
a school. Many of the buildings on this map can
be correlated to structures observed on aerial
photographs taken in the 1930s.
The 1930s and 1960 aerial photographs
and the 1958 USGS map all show that the
northern portion of the project area, principally
the Cherokee Bayou floodplain, and the small
north-flowing tributary valleys remained forested. The central and southern parts were largely
cleared and in use as agricultural fields and
pastures (Figure 1.8). Also evident are numerous buildings associated with farmsteads, once
again, principally in the eastern and southern
parts of the area.
Combined, the historic maps and aerial
photographs allowed identification of a number
of potential archeological sites ranging in
age from mid–late nineteenth century to mid
twentieth century and including farmsteads,
house sites, roads, a cemetery, a school, and a
church. These locations were in areas slated for
100 percent intensive pedestrian coverage, and
thus special provisions to ensure that these had
a chance of being discovered during fieldwork
were not necessary. But knowing their locations
prior to fieldwork assisted the crew in finding
the ones that still survive.

A third setting that was thought to have
some potential for Native American sites consists of elevated areas along the small streams
that flow north through the uplands toward
Cherokee Bayou. It was anticipated that sites
would be less frequent here and that most of
them would be special-purpose campsites or
extractive or processing locations, since the
uplands presented fewer opportunities for sustained settlement and use than the valley wall
and floodplain. The six small north-draining
streams in Area W have created valleys of varying size, but none have developed floodplains
that could been used for any appreciable prehistoric agricultural pursuits.
As in the Area V survey, an important part
of planning for identifying historic sites involved
examination of the following historic maps and
aerial photographs: (1) a map of the Sabine
River valley dating to 1863 (Von Rosenberg
1863); (2) an early-twentieth-century soils map
of Rusk County (Ely and Kocher 1907); (3) aerial
photographs taken in 1930, 1939, and 1960
(Tobin International 1930; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939, 1960); (4) a 1938
Rusk County road map; and (5) the 1958 USGS
topographic map (Tatum quadrangle). The 1863
map, although it cannot be georeferenced, is
interesting for the details it does show for the
present project area. It shows Cherokee Bayou
flowing through dense woods and a large swamp
to the north, with the area south of the bayou
labeled as “oak, hickory, black jack with under
brush” (Figure 1.5). Flanagan’s Tannery and
Mill are shown east of the project area in Area V,
and a road runs south and west from those improvements to the Marshall and Howel farms
within or near the current project area. The
communities of Tatum and Camden were just
southeast and north of the project area, with
Camden being at the Walling’s Ferry crossing
of the Sabine River.
The early soils map (fieldwork in 1903,
published in 1907), does not show much detail,
but it does show the Texas Sabine Valley and
Northwestern Railway had been built along the
northeast edge of the project area by that time,
with the railroad-stop and logging community
of Flanagan just beyond it. It also shows several
roads corresponding roughly to some on the 1863
map and perhaps some on the later county road
map (Figure 1.6).

Methods
A crew of three or four people conducted
intensive pedestrian survey of the 4,392 acres
over the course of 7 months. The survey required
351 person-days of effort, for an average survey
rate of 12.5 acres per person-day. Survey transects were generally spaced 30 m apart or closer,
depending on the thickness of vegetation cover.
Surface exposures such as cutbanks, eroded surfaces, animal burrow backdirt piles, and cattle

Shovel testing was conducted on level
uplands and midslope and lower-slope benches
that still retain sediment, and in floodplains
and on terraces adjacent to ravines, creeks, and
probable springs. Areas that are highly eroded or
heavily disturbed or that contain standing water
generally were not subjected to shovel testing.
Steep slopes (usually greater than 20 percent)
also were not shovel tested. Shovel tests were
excavated in arbitrary 20-cm levels for vertical

trails were examined for evidence of prehistoric
or historic artifacts and features. Surface inspection was supplemented with shovel testing done
both at regular intervals along survey transects
and judgmentally based on the nature of the
landform and site probability. A total of 3,479
shovel tests were excavated, for an overall average of 1 test per 1.3 acres surveyed (see Chapter
3 for a discussion of variability in shovel testing
intensity by landform).

control and were 30 cm in diameter. All tests
were excavated to clay substrate where feasible,
although in some instances hardpan soil, heavy
gravel, tree roots, or deep sand prevented this.
All removed sediments were sifted through
1/4-inch-mesh woven hardware cloth and examined for cultural materials. When cultural
materials were encountered, additional tests
were excavated around the initial positive test
to aid in identifying site boundaries and artifact

densities within sites. In some cases, the number
of shovel tests excavated to define a site was
limited by landform size, topography, extensive
disturbance, or a combination of these factors.
In general, though, at least six shovel tests were
excavated at each site where possible. Excluding
one historic cemetery site, 1,186 shovel tests
were excavated to investigate 65 sites, ranging from 4 to 128 tests per site (median = 12).
Each shovel test was designated with a unique

number, and general descriptions of soil texture,
color, depth, and depth to clay were recorded.
Basic counts of various artifact types were also
recorded for each test.
Initially, backhoe trenching was planned for
parts of the Cherokee Bayou floodplain to look
for deeply buried sites. This was abandoned,
however, when pedestrian survey of the floodplain revealed that shovel testing is adequate
for finding sites on topographic highs there,
and that much of the surrounding floodplain is

too low and swampy to contain sites or to allow
trenching.
Each crew person had a Garmin Etrex 10
hand-held GPS unit for recording shovel test
locations. A larger Trimble GeoXT GPS receiver
was used by the project archeologist to record
the locations of site boundaries, features, architecture, and landmarks, and to spatially orient
the crew periodically during survey and when
beginning new survey areas. Where very dense
tree cover or terrain obstructions hindered the

use of the Trimble unit, the Garmin units were
used. All data recorded by GPS units were also
noted on 8.5x11-inch field survey block sheets
provided to each crew person and on site-specific sketch maps. In addition, a master set of
survey block sheets with all shovel test and
site locations was created and maintained by
the project archeologist. All GPS data were
post-processed using differential correction
through the Pathfinder Office program to

ensure submeter accuracy in horizontal location information. GPS data were converted to
shape files for displaying shovel test locations
and other spatial information within a GIS
environment. This enabled the spatial information to be overlaid onto a digitized topographic
map and aerial photographs showing the
survey area boundary so field maps could be
updated on a daily basis. These methods helped
ensure adequate coverage of all survey areas.

The literature review guided identification
of potential locations of previously undocumented historic-age resources. Maps consulted that
include the study area date to 1863, 1940, 1958,
and 1961 (Texas State Highway Department
1940, 1961; U.S. Geological Survey 1958; Von
Rosenberg 1863); some of these were available
from the Teas Department of Transportation’s
Texas Historic Overlay. Aerial images of
the study area date to 1930, 1939, and 1960
(Tobin International 1930; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939, 1960). Local appraisal district records helped determine estimated
dates of construction, especially for the last
quarter of the twentieth century, but these only
serve as a guide since they are often approximate
and are limited to privately held land parcels.
The literature review also established
appropriate historic contexts within which to
evaluate historic-age resources by reviewing
secondary sources. Appropriate historic contexts
gleaned from the literature review for this study
area are agriculture, ethnic heritage (African
American), and industry.
A historian meeting the Secretary of the
Interior’s professional qualifications standards
conducted the reconnaissance survey of buildings and structures. Before performing fieldwork, the historian compared historic maps
and aerial photographs with similar current
materials and consulted appraisal district
records for possible dates of construction. The
reconnaissance survey began with becoming
familiar with the area by driving the perimeter
of and each roadway within the project area.
Since there was potential to identify historic
districts or landscapes, the historian examined
the study area and its surrounds for clusters of
historic-age resources that could be considered
eligible for the National Register as a collection.
The reconnaissance survey included photographic and resource-specific documentation of
each resource in the study area constructed by
1973. With a few exceptions, at least two digital photographs were taken of each identified
historic-age building, structure, and landscape
feature. The survey team recorded each resource
to develop an inventory by resource number

Prior to fieldwork, high-resolution aerial
photographs taken in 2011 and provided by the
Sabine Mine were stitched together to create
a composite aerial of the project area, and this
imagery was made a layer in the GIS package
for the project. Other layers included survey area
boundary lines, property lines, USGS topography, and potential historic localities. Hard copies
of these were provided to all crew members for
navigation and recording purposes, and the
GIS package was downloaded into the Trimble
GeoXT GPS unit.
With the potential historic localities being
part of the GIS package, the Trimble could be
used to navigate directly to these locations, and
each area was then investigated for any evidence
of historic archeological sites. Surface inspection
was supplemented with shovel testing. This was
done except in the following situations: (1) where
locations obviously had been disturbed to such
an extent, for example, by debris dumping,
gravel or sand pits, well roads, and gas or oil well
pads, that there was no chance for intact archeological remains; and (2) where maps and aerial
photographs suggest that remains date to the
latter half of the twentieth century and thus are
too recent to warrant recording as archeological
sites (i.e., improvements visible only on the 1958
USGS map or 1960 aerials) and on-the-ground
inspection confirmed this.
Historical Resources Survey
and Archival Research
Tasks associated with historical resources
studies included a file search and literature
review, archival research, completion of a reconnaissance survey of buildings and structures,
and analysis incorporated into preparation of
this report with findings. A historian conducted
the file search, literature review, and reconnaissance survey in August 2012; analysis and report
preparation were conducted subsequently.
The file search guided identification of
known historic-age resources in and near the
study area. Information was gathered from
the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas
Historic Sites Atlas files on National Historic
Landmarks, National Register properties,
Official Texas Historical Markers (Recorded
Texas Historic Landmarks, subject markers,
and Texas Centennial markers), cemeteries, and
neighborhood surveys; the Texas Department

to 1945 on microfilm at the Texas State Library
and Archives confirmed ownership and included
the valuation of real property over time, slaveholdings, livestock, and other personal property.
The presence of livestock might suggest land
uses, occupation, and degree of wealth. Use of
properties by non-owner occupants is difficult to
document in legal and ad valorem tax records
alone. However, the site histories detail individuals who held title to the tracts on which
these historic archeological sites are situated
and, to the degree possible, uses and improvements associated with the land. The series of
population censuses offered information about
heads of households and those who resided with
them from decennial years from 1850 to 1940.
Additional data about people who occupied these
properties included age, gender, marital status,
number of surviving children and their ages
and genders, occupation, and place of birth and
in some cases unrelated people who may have
lived in a household.

Archival research traced ownership history
for land parcels on which the historic archeological sites are situated. American Electric Power
supplied run sheets with chains of title for each
parcel with a site. Archival records at the Texas
General Land Office, Rusk County Clerk, Texas
State Library and Archives, Heritage Quest
Online, aggregate census data, and pertinent
Internet sites provided documentation for
former occupants of these historic archeological
sites. Files at the Texas General Land Office
gave evidence of original survey notes for land
grants on which these sites are situated and
chronicled transfers of land from the State of
Texas to private citizens. Site-specific research
conducted in Henderson using deed, district
court, and probate records at the Rusk County
Clerk’s office completed ownership information,
with some exceptions, for the sites from the late
nineteenth century to present. Failure of purchasers to record deeds with the county clerk
created breaks in some chains of title, and it
was not possible to ascertain ownership for some

provided access to water resources on and draining onto the Sabine River floodplain, and they
provided arable farmland where Caddo Indians
could have grown crops. Sites are much less
common in upland areas back from the valley
wall, probably because of the lack of sufficient
and stable water sources. The few prehistoric
sites found along the small drainages here are
small lithic scatters. Even less common are prehistoric components directly on the Sabine River
floodplain. Although the large Early Caddo ceremonial-civic center at the Hudnall-Pirtle site
is within a low terrace setting not far upstream,
the survey data indicate that much of the floodplain was too low and too frequently inundated
to support anything more than occasional or
limited occupation during prehistoric times.
In contrast to Native American sites, historic components are most common in the uplands back from the valley wall. This probably
is related mostly to the following: (1) the Sabine
River floodplain was too low and wet to have
seen substantial use; and (2) the uplands are
level to gently sloping and amenable to farming
and stock raising and close to early roads, the
railroad, and the town of Tatum.
The second project in the initial Rusk
Permit area consisted of test excavations at
three Native American sites in Area V: 41RK557,
41RK558, and 41RK562 (Dockall and Fields
2011). The earliest evidence of occupation is
limited to a single Evans point denoting possible Middle Archaic period use and several Gary
points indicating possible Woodland period
usage from 41HS557. There are no substantial deposits associated with either Archaic or
Woodland occupations at this site, however.
Woodland to Early Caddo occupation is best

Several archeological investigations have
been conducted in the vicinity of the current
project area (Figure 2.1). These include previous
work in the eastern part of the Rusk Permit
and projects at South Hallsville/South Marshall
Mine, Martin Lake and Martin Lake Mine,
Marshall Mine, and Oak Hill Mine.
Rusk Permit Area
In 2008–2009, the Sabine Mining Company
initiated work south of the Sabine River in connection with its new Rusk Permit mining area.
To date, two archeological projects have been
done here. The first was an intensive survey of
6,925 acres straddling the Panola–Rusk County
line, encompassing Area V (Dockall et al. 2010).
This survey resulted in the discovery and documentation of 53 previously unrecorded sites
and collection of additional information on 4
previously recorded sites. Of the total, 19 are
prehistoric Native American sites, 35 are historic
sites, and 3 are both prehistoric and historic.
Fifteen of the prehistoric components are lithic
scatters, 6 appear to contain materials relating
to Caddo occupations, and 1 appears to have
Woodland-age materials. Twenty-nine of the
historic components are farmsteads or house
sites, 4 are cemeteries, 2 are improved springs,
2 are roads, and 1 is a cluster of house sites or
farmsteads that formed a community.
The density of prehistoric sites is not even
across the initial Rusk Permit survey area, with
prehistoric sites most common in Pleistocene
terrace and valley wall settings. These settings

It consists of a series of heavily reworked and
fragmentary Friley arrow points in association
with a small number of sherds that probably
relate to Williams Plain, Marksville, and Coles

with the Hudnall-Pirtle site ca. 3.2 km to the

The more intensive, or more consistent, use
of the area later by Caddo Indians is reflected
by the relatively abundant Caddo ceramics at
41RK557. This is one of five sites wit Caddo

Chapter 2: Archeological and Historical Background
archeological sites, 402 with Native American
components and 260 with historic components
(for a recent summary, see Norment et al.
2010:19–34). The vast majority are known only
from survey-level data, but 3 have seen extensive
excavations, and another 91 have seen varying
amounts of test excavations.
Some of the tested and excavated sites
date mostly to the Archaic, Woodland, or Early
to Middle Caddo periods, but most have Late
Caddo components that relate to the Nadaco
Caddo Pine Tree Mound community. The focal
point of this community was the ceremonial
center at Pine Tree Mound (41HS15) on Potters
Creek, which was surrounded by a village nucleus of about 15 household compounds (Fields
and Gadus 2012). At least 25 other residential
areas and probably short-term campsites are
on Starkey and Potters Creeks nearby, mostly
in a 5.5-km stretch downstream; and at least 15
other sites, probably a mix of short-term campsites and more-intensively occupied residential
locales and including 1 other mound site, are
scattered along other Sabine River tributaries
to the west and the adjacent upland margins
overlooking the Sabine floodplain.
Fields and Gadus (2012) argue that the
home territory of the Nadaco Caddo extended
well beyond the surveyed area at the mine,
perhaps over an area roughly 50 km northsouth by 60 km east-west and encompassing
some 2,400 km2, with the Sabine River flowing
through the middle. People were not distributed evenly throughout this area, though. As
noted, the main village was on Potters Creek
north of the river, anchored by 41HS15 at its
north end. The rest of the community appears
to have been more rural, although perhaps at
two different scales. Other north-side tributary
valleys, extending from maybe Mason Creek on
the west to Eightmile, Caddo, Jackson Creek on
the east, may have supported moderately scattered settlements. The entire territory south of
the river, accounting for well over half of it and
including the current project area, may have
been sparsely settled.

the Hasinai Trace, came up out of the Sabine
River bottoms. These appear to be a series of
small residential sites and short-term trailside
campsites dating to various parts of the Caddo
period rather than a single large Caddo village.
One important site that is just outside the
north boundary of the Rusk Permit and that was
known long before work in the permit area began
is the Hudnall-Pirtle site (41RK4). It is a very
large (1,100x400 m) early Caddo civic and ceremonial center. The site is on a low terrace near
the Sabine River. A. M. Woolsey first recorded
this site in the 1930s for the University of Texas
based on an informant’s report. Woolsey recorded
it as a single mound. Later the site saw limited
testing by Buddy Calvin Jones, but this work
was never reported. In 1989 and 1990, the staff
of the Texas Historical Commission and volunteers conducted test excavations (Bruseth 1991;
Bruseth and Perttula 2006). The site apparently
dates mostly to a.d. 1000–1200 and contains
eight constructed mounds, three borrow pits, a
plaza, and residential areas. The modest amount
of archeological work done there has yielded a
sizable collection of artifacts, with the ceramics
including sherds similar to Davis Incised, Kiam
Incised, Dunkin Incised, Weches Fingernail
Impressed, Pennington Punctated-Incised,
Crockett Curvilinear Incised, Hickory Fine
Engraved, Spiro Engraved, Holly Fine Engraved,
and Coles Creek Incised (Bruseth and Perttula
2006:82–95). Projectile point types identified
include Catahoula, Friley, Scallorn, Homan,
Colbert, Alba, Steiner, and Kent (Bruseth and
Perttula 2006:100–107). Site 41RK4 is listed
in the National Register of Historic Places and
is owned as a preserve by the Archaeological
Conservancy.
South Hallsville/South
Marshall Mine
Since the mid 1970s, some 39,000 acres on
the north side of the Sabine River have been
surveyed archeologically in connection with
the Sabine Mining Company’s South Hallsville/
South Marshall lignite mine. The east edge of
this mine approaches Colliers Creek, a tributary
of Eightmile Creek, and it extends west to encompass parts of the valleys of Potters, Spring,
Brandy Branch, Hatley, Hardin, Rogers, and
Clarks Creeks. At least 48 projects have been undertaken here, resulting in the recording of 621

sites were in upland settings. Two of the Caddo
sites contained intact subsurface midden deposits, while 1 of the historic sites was a late
1800s sawmill. Another set of Espey, Huston and
Associates projects during this time included the
following: test excavations at prehistoric sites
41PN14 (Early and Late Caddo?) and 41PN25
(Late Caddo); archival research for historic sites
41PN32 and 41PN39 and the historic communities of Sugar Hill and Harris Chapel; survey
focused on 10 areas totaling 3,550 acres in
which 11 prehistoric and 7 historic sites were
found; testing at 41PN57, an undifferentiated
Caddo site; and survey of 550 acres in which 3
prehistoric sites were found (Espey, Huston and
Associates, Inc. 1984).
A subsequent survey by Espey, Huston and
Associates of 13,000 acres within Martin Lake
Mine Areas A, B, and C recorded 30 new sites—4
with prehistoric components and 27 with historic components—and revisited 43 previously
recorded sites (Espey, Huston and Associates,
Inc. 1986). Archeological testing also was conducted on one previously recorded historic site
(41PN42), and ethnohistorical research was
done for 41PN29 and 41PN26, also previously
recorded. Later, Foster (1992) completed HABS
documentation of the John T. Brooks house and
its associated outbuildings at 41PN29, a nineteenth-century farmstead.
In 1988, Espey, Huston and Associates
completed limited testing at four historic sites at
Martin Lake Mine—41PN75, 41PN78, 41PN91,
and 41PN94—and survey-level investigations
at a fifth site, 41PN96, and limited work at a
possible prehistoric cemetery, 41PN48 (Kotter
et al. 1988). Only 41PN75, the Mudcat Chimney
site, was judged to warrant further work, and
data recovery investigations were performed the
following year (Kotter and Moore 1990). The excavations included work in trash deposits in the
yard of a house that had been occupied between
1880 and 1955.
In 1990, Espey, Huston and Associates
surveyed 2,980 additional acres in Martin Lake
Mine Area B (Kotter et al. 1992). Much of the
project area was in upland settings, and just
two prehistoric sites were found. Both were
very low-density lithic scatters with no temporal
diagnostics. Eleven historic sites were located
representing mid- and late-nineteenth- and
twentieth-century occupations. In 1992, Nash
et al. (1994) completed National Register testing

was sparsely occupied prehistorically compared
to areas north of the Sabine River (Dockall et al.
2010:228). The earliest survey work in that vicinity was a brief investigation of Rusk County
conducted by Jack Hughes in 1948, during which
he recorded four sites (Hughes 1948). Three of
these sites were 41RK3 (Millsey Williamson),
41RK35 (Taylor), and 41RK36, which were
later revisited and further recorded in a larger
survey of the Martin Lake area by Andrew
McDonald (1972) for the Texas Archeological
Salvage Project. The later survey documented
46 prehistoric and historic archeological sites
within the Martin Lake impoundment area. The
Millsey Williamson site, with evidence of historic
Caddo occupation, was one of seven sites that
Buddy Calvin Jones (1968) used to define the
Kinsloe focus.
A program of testing was conducted
at five sites (41RK19, 41RK21, 41RK32,
41RK36, 41RK39) at Martin Lake by the Texas
Archeological Survey (Clark and Ivey 1974). Site
41RK39 was documented as a multicomponent
site beginning in the Late Archaic period and
continuing into the Late Caddo period. Middle
and Late Caddo occupations were documented
at 41RK19, 41RK32, and 41RK39. Site 41RK36
was identified as a contact-period Caddo occupation and contained European trade items.
No Woodland or Early Caddo components were
identified at any of the tested sites.
In 1981, the Texas Archeological Survey
(Moncure and Jackson 1982) conducted intensive pedestrian survey of the railroad and
transmission line corridor for the proposed
Martin Lake Mine. No prehistoric sites were
identified, but one historic site (41RK104, the
Thomas Jefferson Walling cabin) was recorded.
This site subsequently saw extensive research
and data recovery to mitigate its loss (Moncure
1984), and the cabin was restored and relocated to the grounds of the Depot Museum in
Henderson, Texas.
Espey, Huston and Associates (1983) conducted a 19.5 percent stratified survey of Martin
Lake Mine Areas A, B, and C in 1983. Thirty-five
100-acre areas were selected for survey, and 27
sites were identified. These consisted of 5 prehistoric lithic sites, 4 undifferentiated Caddo
occupations, 2 Late Caddo sites, 9 historic house
sites, 2 historic cemeteries, 1 historic sawmill, 3
undifferentiated historic sites, and 1 site with
both prehistoric and historic components. All

Oak Hill Mine

at four late-nineteenth- to early-twentieth-century farmsteads—41PN99, 41PN102, 41PN104,
and 41PN115—in Martin Lake Mine Area B.
In 1996, archeologists with Espey, Huston
and Associates surveyed 2,378 additional acres
in Martin Lake Mine Areas A and B (Taylor and
Tate 1997). Thirty prehistoric and 17 historic
sites were investigated. Most of the prehistoric
sites were low- to very low-density lithic scatters unattributed to a specific time period. The
historic sites represented primarily early- to
mid-twentieth-century farmsteads and tenant
homes that had been removed or were in very
bad condition.
In 2005–2009, PBS&J undertook several
other projects at Martin Lake Mine. These
include the following: surveys of 2,646 acres
resulting in the discovery of 1 prehistoric site
and 29 historic sites (Coke et al. 2006; Dixon
et al. 2006; Sherman et al. 2005); National
Register eligibility testing at ephemeral prehistoric sites 41PN124, 41PN131, 41PN137,
41PN214, 41RK194, and 41RK455 (Dixon
et al. 2007; Sherman et al. 2008, 2009); and
testing at multicomponent 41PN144, followed
by data recovery excavations focusing on the
early-nineteenth-century component there
(Dixon et al. n.d.).

The Texas Archeological Survey conducted
a reconnaissance-level survey of the Mill Creek
area for Oak Hill Mine in Rusk County southwest of the Rusk Permit area in 1980 (Moncure
and Jackson 1980). The entire survey area was
within an upland setting and was assessed as
having a low potential to contain prehistoric
cultural resources. Only four sites were documented. The results of this survey were used
to develop a predictive modeling tool for future
planning phases of the Martin Lake Mine area.
Moncure and Jackson (1980:49) identified four
probability zones for archeological resources.
Zone 1 was an area of high probability and
consisted of locations within 200 m of reliable
water resources. Zone 2, moderate probability,
included places in excess of 200 m from reliable water sources but with other resource
potential such as terrain likely to have been
used for game lookouts or other food resources.
Zone 3 was of low probability and consisted of
localities in excess of 200 m from reliable water
and an absence of secondary resources. Zone 4
comprised all areas so disturbed as to have no
remaining potential for intact archeological
resources.
A later survey in Oak Hill Mine (Jackson
1982) applied the predictive model developed in
the earlier reconnaissance survey (Moncure and
Jackson 1980). The survey covered 6,500 acres
and resulted in the documentation of 3 prehistoric sites and 15 historic sites. Very few prehistoric
sites were in upland settings, whereas historic
occupations were predominantly distributed in
upland areas.
In the mid 1980s, Espey, Huston and
Associates surveyed 346 acres at Oak Hill Mine
(Jones et al. 1987). One prehistoric site and
1 historic site were found, and 41 previously
recorded sites were investigated. Prehistoric
sites included campsites and lithic and ceramic
scatters, while historic sites were mostly house
sites and farmsteads dating to the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries. In 1989, Rogers et al.
(1992) surveyed 2,280 acres at Oak Hill Mine.
Twenty new sites (14 with prehistoric components and 9 with historic components) and 3
previously recorded sites were investigated, 5
of which were considered to warrant further
work to assess their eligibility for National
Register listing.

Marshall Mine
In 2010–2011, Prewitt and Associates
conducted archeological and historical resources surveys within 2,144 acres of land in
the proposed Marshall Mine in Harrison and
Panola Counties on the north side of the Sabine
River east of the Rusk Permit (Griffith et al.
2012). The archeological survey resulted in
documentation of 29 sites: 8 Native American,
18 historic, and 3 with both prehistoric and
historic components. Six of the Native American
components contain materials relating to
occupations by Caddo Indians, including the
C. D. Marsh site (41HS269), one of the historic
cemeteries that Buddy Calvin Jones had used
to define the Kinsloe focus. The other Native
American components are sparse lithic scatters
of unknown association. Eighteen of the historic sites are farmsteads, 1 is a barn, and 2 are
artifact scatters; they date almost entirely to
the twentieth century, with a few being associated with the Depression-era Sabine Farms
resettlement project.

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
In 2004, PBS&J continued testing prehistoric sites at Oak Hill, working on 41RK295 and
41RK304 (Cliff and Sills 2005). Site 41RK295
was interpreted as a large, diffuse site occupied
perhaps in the Late Archaic and Early Caddo
periods, while 41RK304 was a small lithic site
probably occupied in the Archaic period. Neither
was considered worthy of additional work.

Espey, Huston and Associates completed
data recovery investigations at the Millville Mill
site, 41RK223, at Oak Hill Mine in 1993 (Foster
2000). The work involved archival research,
excavation, and architectural documentation at
a nineteenth-century mill associated with the
town of Millville. The same year, Espey, Huston
and Associates undertook National Register
testing at eight sites at Oak Hill (Rogers et al.
1994). Historic sites 41RK86A and 41RK108 and
prehistoric sites 41RK216 and 41RK218 were
judged ineligible for National Register listing,
while prehistoric sites 41RK214, 41RK215,
41RK222, and 41RK223 were considered eligible based on their potential to yield important
information about the Woodland and Middle
Caddo archeology of the region. One of these
sites, Oak Hill Village (41RK214), saw extensive data recovery excavations in 1994–1995
(Rogers and Perttula 2004). The site contained
materials relating to occupations from the late
Paleoindian period through the Late Caddo
period, but the predominant occupation related
to a Middle Caddo (a.d. 1150–1450) village with
over 40 structures.
In 1997, archeologists from Espey, Huston
and Associates conducted additional survey
work at Oak Hill Mine (Skokan et al. 1997). Of
note was the discovery of 41RK305. National
Register eligibility testing was conducted at
the site in 2004, and this was followed shortly
by data recovery efforts (Cliff and Sills 2004).
The investigations revealed that the site was
occupied between 1815 and 1860, and glass trade
beads found there suggested that it may have
been used by Cherokees or another immigrant
Native American group.
In 1999–2000, PBS&J conducted National
Register testing at sites 41RK107, 41RK240,
41RK242, 41RK243, 41RK276, and 41RK286 at
Oak Hill Mine (Sherman 2001). Site 41RK240
was considered to contain important information for understanding the prehistory of the
area, while 41RK107, 41RK242, 41RK243,
41RK276, and 41RK286 were judged to lack
such information.
In 2003, PBS&J conducted National
Register testing at prehistoric site 41RK328 at
Oak Hill Mine (Cliff et al. 2004). It was interpreted as a large, diffuse site that could have
remains dating to the Archaic, Woodland, and
Caddo periods. No further work was considered
warranted.

REGIONAL NATIVE AMERICAN
CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Evidence of Native American occupation
within the middle Sabine River basin goes back
at least 12,000 years and extends as late as the
1800s. This section provides a discussion of how
sites in this area relate to prehistoric and early
historic utilization of the middle Sabine River
drainage and northeast Texas in general. The
cultural history sequence used here is based
largely on a temporal framework derived from
Story’s (1990:168–177, 213–222, 293–342) extensive review of the archeology of the Texas Gulf
coastal plain. Additional sources of information
include Perttula (1992, 1996, 2004a, 2005) and
the exhibit entitled “Tejas: Life and Times of the
Caddo” on the Texas Beyond History website
(www.texasbeyondhistory.net).
Paleoindian Period:
10,000–7,000 b.c.
The earliest evidence of Native American
occupation of the northeast Texas and northwest Louisiana region is attributable to the
Paleoindian period. Projectile points such as
Clovis, Scottsbluff, San Patrice, Dalton, and
Meserve, as well as other distinctive tools like
Albany knives, Red River knives, and Dalton
adzes are associated with this early period
(Story 1990:177). Often these early artifacts are
recovered from nonaggrading upland settings
where they occur as isolated finds or are mixed
with artifacts from later occupations such that
little can be discerned concerning early lifeways,
other than that a particular landform had been
a site of occupation. Even with this paucity
of information, investigators have concluded
that early adaptive strategies involved high
residential mobility over large territories with
short-lived occupations by small groups who
practiced a generalized subsistence strategy
focused on hunting. Population densities were

plant processing. Hunting appears to have been
the cornerstone of the adaptive strategy of these
early Native Americans.

low, and hence there was little competition for
resources. Constant group movement as well as
fluidity of group composition were both highly
adaptive means of avoiding or resolving stressful
economic or social issues (Story 1990:177; Story
et al. 1990:425–426).
Evidence of early occupations near the
Rusk Permit area consists mostly of isolated
projectile points such as Dalton dart points from
41HS574 and 41HS588 (Dockall et al. 2008:119;
Gadus et al. 2006:68) and San Patrice points
from 41HS469 and 41HS890 (Keller 1994:11–12;
Wilder et al. 2007:56). Just southwest of the
project area, the Oak Hill Village site (41RK214)
produced a number of San Patrice points (n = 11)
as well as Dalton (n = 2) and Scottsbluff (n = 1)
points (Rogers and Perttula 2004:141–143).
San Patrice and Dalton points suggest a strong
Late Paleoindian period occupation of the site.
Unfortunately, as is often the case, other artifacts or cultural features that would provide
a more complete understanding of what this
occupation entailed could not be associated with
the points.
Sites with early artifacts to the north and
east of the project area in the Red River drainage include Jake Martin in northeast Upshur
County (Davis and Davis 1960), Forrest Murphy
in Marion County (Story 1990:180), and the John
Pearce site in Caddo Parish, Louisiana (Webb
et al. 1971). The John Pearce site is of particular
interest because San Patrice points make up
45 percent (n = 62) of the points recovered from
that site. Also found were a number of lanceolate
points representing Pelican, Meserve, and Clovis
types (Webb et al. 1971:11–19). The variety and
concentration of other stone tools in the assemblage give an indication that this early site may
have functioned as a base camp within a wider
settlement system (Webb et al. 1971:40–41).
Type varieties within the San Patrice points, two
of which were identified, also suggest that the
site was repeatedly occupied by multiple related
groups of people, possibly signaling the very
early beginnings of localized group territories.
Tools other than projectile points include end
scrapers, side scrapers, burins, denticulates, and
retouched flakes, all of which are suggestive of
processing of resources gained through hunting
(Webb et al. 1971:40–47). Tools missing from the
assemblage, such as adzes, choppers, mullers
and nutting stones, and other ground stone tools,
underscore the apparent limited importance of

Archaic Period: 7,000–200 b.c.
Functional diversification of tool assemblages, including the addition of ground stone
tools for plant processing, indicates a change in
adaptive strategy that marks the Archaic period.
Expedient tools are also an important part of
these diverse assemblages, while there appears
to have been limited tool curation and recycling
and more frequent use of local lithic materials
for tool production compared to Paleoindian
period assemblages (Story 1990:213; Story et al.
1990:426). And as possibly seen beginning with
the Late Paleoindian San Patrice point varieties,
distinctive regional artifact styles became more
pronounced during the Archaic period, while the
first true cemeteries signal stronger territorial
identifications. Based on these characteristics,
adaptive strategies during the Archaic period
appear to have involved seasonal hunting and
foraging of a wide variety of resources. Plant
foods attained greater importance during this
period. Resource exploitation patterns were intensive and focused geographically. Decreasing
residential mobility pushed the importance of
establishing trade relationships and alliance
building as mechanisms for solving economic
and social problems that Paleoindian groups
managed simply by moving camps.
Archaic sites have greater accumulations
of occupational debris than earlier sites, which
may be related to less-frequent moves and longer-term occupation of the same locations. The
impetus for changes in mobility, subsistence, and
technology during the Archaic may be attributed
in part to environmental changes that occurred
across southeastern North America between
7,000 and 3,000 b.c. (Delcourt and Delcourt
1985:19–20). The Holocene thermal maximum
(Hypsithermal) may have had a significant influence on subsistence and technology because
it changed regional floral and faunal patterns
across the southeastern United States.
Archaic period occupation remains are
abundant in northeast Texas and northwest
Louisiana, especially the occupations associated
with Late Archaic groups. However, the sequence
of projectile point styles through this long period
and their associations with other artifact and
23

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
points appear mainly to be made from local
resources (Rogers and Perttula 2004:151). This
difference in material usage supports the conclusion that the Archaic period saw the gradual
establishment of local group territories.
Within the Potters Creek area north of
the Sabine River, excavations at the Resch site
(41HS16) revealed a Late Archaic component
marked by mainly Ellis (n = 45) and Kent
(n = 42) dart points but with a strong presence
of the Yarbrough type (n = 15) (Webb et al.
1969:3–106). Fewer Early to Middle Archaic
points were recovered (n = 26) with Wells
(n = 5) and Palmillas (n = 16) points making up
most of the sample. Notable among the Early
to Middle Archaic points is a single specimen
typed as a Sinner, which is comparable to the
Evans type. The Evans point is considered to be
a temporal diagnostic for the beginning of the
Middle Archaic period in Louisiana (Saunders
and Allen 1995:17).
A single Evans point manufactured of
probably local chert was recovered during test
excavations at 41RK557 within the Rusk Permit
Area V (Dockall and Fields 2011:44–45). This
type is primarily distributed in Arkansas and
Louisiana, being recorded at Poverty Point,
Jaketown, and Cowpen Slough (Turner and
Hester 1985). Schambach (1998:52) has suggested that Evans points have their greatest
abundance and distribution in an area of
Arkansas from the Cooper site to the southeast
into Cleveland and Lincoln Counties. Ford and
Webb (1956) defined the type based on four specimens from Poverty Point, but Schambach reports
hundreds of specimens from the aforementioned
sites in Arkansas.

ecofact assemblages are not well established.
Problems lie with the lack of well-stratified
and well-dated sites and poor faunal and vegetal preservation in most sites. However, some
Archaic period point types are common within
the region, and their relative frequencies at particular sites can provide some clues regarding
the development of local group social identities.
For the Early to Middle Archaic period, these
types include Johnson, Wells, Bulverde, Morrill,
Carrollton, Dawson, Neches River, and Motley.
Later Archaic period types include Yarbrough,
Elam, Ellis, Edgewood, and Kent.
Data recovery investigations at three multicomponent sites near the current project area
suggest that early Wells and later Yarbrough
dart points mark local adaptations during the
Archaic period. Site 41HS474 (Heartfield, Price,
and Green, Inc. 1988) is on Hatley Creek, a north
bank tributary of the Sabine River, northeast of
the present survey area. This site has an Early
to Middle Archaic component marked by Wells
(n = 6) and Carrollton (n = 11) dart points that
together make up 23 percent of the typeable
dart points recovered (Heartfield, Price, and
Green 1988:7-8 to 7-20). However, Middle to Late
Archaic period points constitute 50 percent of
the typeable points, suggesting more-frequent
reoccupation during that period, with Yarbrough
(n = 18) well represented. Other late dart points
recovered include Edgewood (n = 1), Ellis (n = 6),
Ensor (n = 3), Kent (n = 6), and Williams (n = 3).
The remainder of the dart point collection consists of Late Archaic or Woodland period Gary
points (n = 20, 27 percent).
At the Oak Hill Village site in Rusk County,
Late Archaic projectile points again dominate
the collection at 53 percent of the typeable dart
points. Yarbrough (n = 58) is prominent while
other types identified are Bulverde (n = 4), Darl
(n = 2), Ellis (n = 11), Kent (n = 14), and Woden
(n = 9) (Rogers and Perttula 2004:151–165).
An Early to Middle Archaic component is also
present based on the 29 percent of the typeable
points classed as Wells (n = 19), Morrill (n = 7),
Carrollton (n = 1), and a straight-stemmed provisional type (n = 9). In addition, several early
types recovered not common in the area include
Cache River (n = 1), Palmer (n = 2), Big Sandy
(n = 1), and Lone Oak (n = 2). The investigators
note that the majority of the early points from
Oak Hill appear to have been fashioned from
nonlocal stone resources, while the Late Archaic

Woodland or Early Ceramic
Period: ca. 200 b.c.–a.d. 800
The Woodland or Early Ceramic period is
defined by significant changes in subsistence,
technology, and social structure (Cliff 1998).
Among these were the inception of horticulture,
the introduction of ceramics, and longer-term
occupation at single sites. Other technological
changes include the first use of the bow and
arrow in the region (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:45). The early ceramics include Williams
Plain pottery, which includes plain and very
thick bowls and flowerpot-shaped jars found in
the Sabine, Sulphur, and Red River drainage
24

Chapter 2: Archeological and Historical Background
basins of northeast Texas (Perttula 2004a:376).
Sites in the Red River drainage in southwestern Arkansas and northeastern Texas are often
characterized by abundant ceramics. However,
the use of ceramics was not as prevalent in many
Woodland sites in the Sulphur and Sabine River
basins (Perttula 2002:39, 2004a:376). These regional differences could indicate variation in food
processing techniques, subsistence preferences,
and mobility during the period. Other diagnostic
artifacts include double-bitted axes, small thin
Gary dart points, and by the end of the period,
corner-notched arrow points such as Colbert
and Friley (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:45–46;
Perttula 2004a:376; Story 1990:248).
People of this period were still mainly
hunter-gatherers living in larger groups for
longer periods of time. More-intensive occupations are indicated by evidence of structures
(postmolds, postholes, and burned clay daub)
and substantial midden deposits at some sites
(Perttula 2004a:277). Plant food processing
increased in importance as demonstrated by
the increased presence of various ground stone
tool types. Plant use included the processing of
hardwood nuts as well as the use and encouragement of some native plants such as sumpweed, Chenopodium, maygrass, knotweed, and
sunflower. Tropical cultigens, primarily squash,
were also introduced at this time, but the evidence indicates that Woodland peoples were still
primarily hunter-gatherers rather than farmers
(Perttula 2004a:377).
Site types consist of residential camps or
base camps that may or may not contain midden
deposits, rare mound sites, and occasionally
established cemeteries. Sites can contain a
variety of cultural features including pits, postholes, burials, cremations, burned rock hearths,
burned rock scatters, and hearth features without burned rocks (Perttula et al. 1993:110–111).
What the majority of these sites have in common
is the presence of Gary dart points and Williams
Plain pottery or other ceramic types associated
with the Lower Mississippi Valley (Tchefuncte
Stamped, Churupa Punctated, Marksville
Incised, and Marksville Stamped var. Troyville),
although these types usually occur in very low
numbers. The evidence indicates that the inhabitants of northeast Texas were participating, to
varying degrees, in a far-flung social and political
network. The reach of this network is exemplified at burial mound sites such as Coral Snake

(McClurkan et al. 1966) on the Sabine River
and Jonas Short in the Angelina River drainage
(McClurkan et al. 1980). Kent and Gary dart
points, Marksville-style ceramics, and nonlocal
burial goods such as copper bracelets, earspools,
beads, and gorgets characterize assemblages at
both sites.
Woodland patterns of lithic material
utilization remained similar to Late Archaic
trends (Perttula 1984:132). For a series of 30
sites, Perttula (1984:137) documented a general
increase in the use of nonlocal lithic materials through the Archaic period and into the
Woodland period. A similar pattern of material
use was noted in east-central Texas (Fields
2004:367–368), with nonlocal materials slightly
less abundant during the Woodland period than
the Late Archaic. In northeast Texas, there
apparently was no centralized control of the
procurement and acquisition of local or nonlocal
lithic materials. Such centers, if they existed
at all, appear to have been beyond the region,
closer to the geological origins of those materials.
The same may be postulated for the nonlocal
ceramics in Woodland and Early Ceramic sites.
Sites attributed to the Woodland or Early
Ceramic period or having components of this age
in the Sabine River drainage basin tend to be
distributed along major streams on higher landforms that are not prone to flooding (Perttula
et al. 1993:104). The Resch site, the Oak Hill
Village site, and 41HS74, discussed above as
examples of Archaic period components near the
present project area, also have Woodland period
components marked by Gary dart points or early
ceramics. Of the three sites, Resch produced
the most Gary points, making up 64 percent of
the typeable points recovered. Gary points are
ubiquitous in Late Archaic, Woodland, and Early
Caddo period components in northeast Texas
and northwestern Louisiana. Their frequency at
Resch suggests a substantial Woodland period
occupation (Webb et al. 1969:96–99). The Resch
site dart point assemblage is complemented by
ceramic sherds representing deep bowls and
flowerpot vases characteristic of Williams Plain
(Webb et al. 1969:20–24), along with Tchefuncte
(1 vessel and 20 sherds) and Marksville (23
sherds) ceramics. In addition, numerous ground
stone items, consisting of 135 pitted stones,
grinding slabs, mullers, mauls, anvils, and hammerstones, are indicative of the importance of
plant processing at this site (Webb et al. 1969:67).
25

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
Recently tested site 41HS231 just north of the
Rusk Permit area also has a notable Woodland
component, although it is mixed with remains
from earlier and later occupations (Dockall et al.
2008:57–96). This radiocarbon-dated component
(a.d. 540–810) is represented by Williams Plain
pottery, a single Coles Creek incised sherd,
Gary and Kent dart points, and perhaps Friley
arrow points (Dockall et al. 2008:145). Recently,
site 41RK562, a small Late Woodland to Early
Caddo campsite, was tested within Area V of the
Rusk Permit (Dockall and Fields 2011:67–79).
Diagnostic artifacts consist of 6 Friley arrow
points and ceramics typed as, or similar to, Coles
Creek Incised, Marksville Incised, and Williams
Plain. A partial vessel recovered from 41RK562
is a shallow, flat-bottomed, simple bowl with
incised decoration on the lip identifying it as
Coles Creek Incised. Other classic examples of
Coles Creek ceramics have been recovered from
the Hudnall-Pirtle site (41RK4) located not far
north of 41RK562 along the Sabine River.

thority; (2) appearance of elite status positions
in Caddo communities; (3) increased sedentism;
and (4) continued and enhanced reliance on
tropical cultigens and intensification of maize
agriculture after a.d. 1200. Early Caddo developments may not have included true agriculture.
Rather, subsistence patterns of hunting and
gathering augmented by horticulture developed during the Archaic and Woodland periods
probably continued (Fritz 1993:56). There was
an apparent increased reliance on plant foods
that resulted in greater population aggregations
at mound centers. These aggregate populations
provided surplus labor to support the expanding
ritual, political, social, and economic infrastructure necessary for elite leaders to manage and
control various resources.
This period saw continued cultural influences from the lower Mississippi River valley.
Along the Red River, Hoffman (1970a, 1970b) has
suggested that Coles Creek occupations predate
Caddo occupations at the Bowman, Crenshaw,
and Hutt sites in Arkansas. Story (1990:323–
324) proposed a similar view of Early Caddo
development in the Piney Woods. Evidence for
the earliest part of this sequence includes the
Pace site and early ceramic manifestations at
Mounds Plantation in northwest Louisiana.
Mounds Plantation and Crenshaw (Webb and
McKinney 1975) and the Spiro site (Brown
1971:212–216) in Oklahoma provide ample evidence of elite-status individuals and complex
burial ceremonies. Schambach (1982:182) also
notes that the elaborate mound burial rituals
associated with the later Fourche Maline in
southwest Arkansas continued to develop into
the early phases of the Caddo cultural sequence.
There is also a suggestion that a similar transition occurred at the Gahagan site (Webb and
Dodd 1939).
Because the development of the Caddo
culture was a local phenomenon, albeit related
to developments across the midwestern and
southeastern United States, and the Caddo
area was ecologically diverse, there appears
to have been substantial cultural variation
among Early Caddo groups. Story (1990:323)
summarizes this variation by hypothesizing
that there were at least four Caddoan subtraditions (i.e. Arkansas Valley, Red River, Woodland
Edge, and Piney Woods), and she speculatively
placed sites in the middle Sabine basin within
the Piney Woods subtradition.

Early Caddo Period:
a.d. 800–1200
The Early Caddo period in northeast
Texas and adjoining areas is best known from
sites that served as ceremonial centers and
have mounds and elaborate burials. Such sites
include the George C. Davis site in Cherokee
County, Texas (Newell and Krieger 1949; Story
1997), Crenshaw in Miller County, Arkansas
(Schambach 1982), and Gahagan (Webb and
Dodd 1939) and Mounds Plantation (Webb
and McKinney 1975) in Red River and Caddo
Parishes, Louisiana. This period typically is
associated with the Alto phase defined based
on excavations at the George C. Davis site.
Characteristic ceramic types are Holly Fine
Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro
Engraved, Kiam Incised, Weches Fingernail
Impressed, Coles Creek Incised, Crockett
Curvilinear Incised, Pennington PunctatedIncised, Canton Incised, and Dunkin Incised
(Gadus et al. 2006:20; Thurmond 1981:435).
Diagnostic arrow point styles are Alba, Bonham,
Friley, Scallorn, and Catahoula (Gadus et al.
2006:20; Thurmond 1981:436).
Perttula (1996:302) summarizes the key
aspects of the development of the Caddo cultural
tradition as: (1) development and elaboration of
complex social relationships and political au26

Chapter 2: Archeological and Historical Background
and 41CS155/156 in Cass County (Cliff and
Hunt 1995:71–74, 144–146, 205–208). The most
important Early Caddo site in the middle reaches of the Sulphur River basin is the T. M. Coles
or Mustang Creek site in Red River County.
Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993:251) list two other
possible mound sites in this portion of the basin,
but their ages and identification as true mound
sites remain unknown. Farther upstream, Caddo
groups occupied the Cooper Lake area in Delta
and Hopkins Counties, but these groups differed
in significant ways from their adjacent Caddo
neighbors (Fields et al. 1997:88–90). Though
there is evidence for some sedentism, groups
local to the upper Sulphur drainage basin were
more residentially mobile. The sites there also
represent occupations by single, small social
groups, and there is no evidence for population
aggregation into multifamily hamlets or small
villages. Early Caddo sites at Cooper Lake
also lack evidence of social complexity, such as
mounds or elaborate burials, that are characteristic of contemporary groups in adjacent areas.
A very different conclusion can be reached
for the Early Caddo culture that developed in
the Red River valley of northwestern Louisiana,
east of the current study area, perhaps growing
out of earlier Coles Creek manifestations. The
civic-ceremonial centers at Mounds Plantation
(Webb and McKinney 1975) and Gahagan (Webb
and Dodd 1939) are compelling evidence of complex societies with elaborate mortuary ceremonialism and far-reaching interaction spheres. Sites
like Smithport Landing and Hanna show that
people lived in small residential sites scattered
across the landscape (Kelley 2006:20; Story
1990:325).
South and southeast of the present study
area in the Neches-Angelina drainage, the most
important Early Caddo site is George C. Davis
(Newell and Krieger 1949; Story 1997). It was
through early excavations here that the original Early Caddo spatio-temporal construct, the
Alto phase or focus, was first defined. With two
structural mounds and one burial mound, this
was the preeminent Caddo community in the
central part of east Texas from about a.d. 900 to
1300. Based on the results of early survey work
in the vicinity, it was long thought by some that
the Davis site did not have a large resident population, but recent geophysical work suggests
this may not be the case, identifying extensive
village remains there.

The Great Bend region of the Red River
valley was a focal point of early Caddo development, as this area contains a number of mound
sites with elaborate burials pointing to hierarchical social systems. The general picture is
one of sedentary agricultural groups inhabiting
small farmsteads dispersed around ceremonial
centers. Just how far up the Red River these
cultural patterns extended is not clear, but the
burials from the T. M. Sanders site in Lamar
County (Krieger 1946), the structural mound
and other evidence at the A. C. Mackin site in
Lamar County (Mallouf 1976), and the mound
and burial evidence at the Dan Holdeman site
in Red River County (Perino 1995) suggest at
least moderate social complexity for Early Caddo
groups well upstream of the Great Bend.
Both the upper Sabine River and upper
Cypress Creek basins appear to have seen substantial occupations during the Early Caddo
period. While small hamlets and farmsteads
were the most common kinds of sites in the
upper Sabine basin during this period (Perttula
et al. 1986:54–56), Perttula (1994a, 1994b, 1999)
lists a number of known or potential mound
sites, many probably dating to the early part of
the period, along the Sabine River or its tributaries in Rains, Smith, Upshur, Van Zandt, and
Wood Counties, indicating the development of
hierarchical social and settlement systems. A
similar situation appears to have occurred in the
upper Cypress basin. Thurmond (1981:450–454)
notes the presence of three Early Caddo mound
sites (Hale, Keith, and Garrison) in Titus and
Wood Counties. Nelson and Perttula (1993)
identify an early Caddo mound at the Z. V. DavisMcPeek site in northwestern Upshur County.
Turning to the Sulphur River basin, limited
excavations make it difficult to determine how
the lower part of the valley was used during
the Early Caddo period. Five possible mound
sites were documented in surveys at Wright
Patman Lake (Malone and Briggs 1970:82, 84;
Stephenson 1950:5–6), but little is known about
them, including their ages. The only two excavated Caddo sites in the area date to the latter
part of the period (Jelks 1961). The proximity of
this part of the basin to the Great Bend of the
Red River suggests that the area was used with
some intensity during this interval. Further upstream, middens implying intensive use during
the early to middle parts of the Caddo period
have been documented at 41CS150, 41CS151,
27

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
Great Bend, the Belcher phase on the Red River
below the Great Bend, the Titus phase in the
Cypress Bayou basin and upper and middle
Sabine River valley, the Angelina phase downstream in the Sabine basin and westward into
the Angelina River valley, and the Frankston
phase in the upper Neches and Angelina River
drainages (Perttula 1992:90). The ceramic types
made and used by these groups are too varied
and numerous to list here, but the diagnostic
arrow point styles are more consistent, including
Perdiz, Talco, Bassett, Maud, Turney, and Fresno
(Fields et al. 1997:90; Gadus et al. 2006:21;
Thurmond 1990:232).
Judging from both the historic accounts
and the archeological evidence, the Great Bend
of the Red River was occupied intensively during
this time. This area contains multiple mound
centers representing Caddo towns, such as those
at Hatchel, Cabe Mounds, and Battle Mound, in
addition to farmsteads and hamlets (Perttula
2004a:393). These Caddo were settled farmers
with structured, hierarchical social systems.
Based on the occurrence of Middle to Late Caddo
mounds or elaborate burials at sites such as
Sam Kaufman, Bob Williams, Roden, Wright
Plantation, Dan Holdeman, and Rowland Clark
in and just north of Red River County (Perino
1981, 1983, 1994, 1995; Perttula 2008; Skinner
et al. 1969), it is clear that Caddo complexes at
least partly comparable to those of the Great Bend
area extended well westward up the Red River.
In the Cypress Creek basin and adjoining
parts of the Sabine basin, Titus phase settlements consisted of dispersed farmsteads or
villages forming local communities through
affiliation with key sites marked by public architecture such as mounds, ritual buildings, and
community cemeteries (Perttula and Sherman
2009:375–377). A minimum of six such communities have been proposed for the Titus
heartland on Big Cypress Creek (Perttula and
Sherman 2009:376–377), and these may have
been organized into two larger core communities, one upstream on the Big Cypress and one
downstream. Integrative sites include at least 11
known mound sites and 13 large community-level cemeteries, and it appears that these groups
had an elite-controlled sociopolitical structure
and a ranked society.
As for earlier time periods, relatively little
is known about Middle to Late Caddo use of
the lower Sulphur River basin because it has

In the middle Sabine basin surrounding the
current project area, the Early Caddo period is
not well understood because of the paucity of
excavated sites of this age. It is surmised that
the region was occupied with some intensity,
based on the presence of the Early Caddo mound
center of Hudnall-Pirtle located on a low terrace
near the Sabine River in northern Rusk County
(Bruseth 1991; Bruseth and Perttula 2006). This
site, at the north-central edge of the Rusk Permit
area, is a large (1,100x400 m) civic/ceremonial
center and dates primarily to a.d. 1000–2000. It
contains eight constructed mounds, three borrow
pits, a plaza, and associated residential areas.
The limited amount of archeological work done
at the site has produced a notable collection of
artifacts. Ceramic types include sherds similar
to Davis Incised, Kiam Incised, Dunkin Incised,
Weches Fingernail Impressed, Pennington
Punctated-Incised, Crockett Curvilinear Incised,
Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro Engraved,
Holly Fine Engraved, and Coles Creek Incised
(Bruseth and Perttula 2006:82–95). Projectile
point types recovered include Catahoula, Friley,
Scallorn, Homan, Colbert, Alba, Steiner, and
Kent (Bruseth and Perttula 2006:100–107).
Early Caddo habitation sites also occur
in the middle Sabine basin, indicating that
some of the population was dispersed across
the landscape. Near the current project area,
Resch, Oak Hill Village, 41HS74, and 41RK562
all have Early Caddo materials and probably
exemplify habitation sites. Only at 41RK562
was the Woodland to Early Caddo component the
primary occupation, and there the lack of good
dated contexts and features precludes much
inference regarding the nature of typical Early
Caddo habitations (Dockall and Fields 2011). It
is even harder to interpret the other sites, since
their main components were earlier or later.
Middle and Late Caddo Periods:
a.d. 1200–1680
With increased reliance on maize agriculture after a.d. 1200, Caddo groups occupied
all major drainage basins in northeast Texas
and adjoining regions, sometimes in town-like
communities and sometimes in more rural
communities. By the Late Caddo period, these
communities were represented by the Texarkana
phase on the Great Bend of the Red River, the
McCurtain phase on the Red River above the
28

Chapter 2: Archeological and Historical Background
seen little work. Two of the three excavated
sites at Wright Patman Lake contained Late
Caddo components, however, and both appear
to represent small farmsteads or hamlets (Jelks
1961:36, 65). Based on proximity to the Great
Bend of the Red River, it seems likely that this
area was occupied by sedentary agriculturalists
during this interval. This is supported by the
data from 41MX5, a small Late Caddo hamlet
in Morris County, which contained evidence
of perhaps two residential structures with
burials (Brewington et al. 1995). Work at the
White Oak Creek Mitigation Area in Bowie,
Cass, and Morris Counties (Cliff 1994:197; Cliff
and Hunt 1995:145, 206) identified a few sites
with Late Caddo components (e.g. 41CS151 and
41CS155/156), but these do not seem to represent intensive occupations, and most may reflect
use for procurement/processing purposes rather
than residential activities.
Sites in the Cooper Lake area indicate that
the upper Sulphur River basin saw relatively
limited use during this time and apparently
was abandoned after about a.d. 1500 (Fields
et al. 1997:90–93). The sites that do date to this
interval reflect more sedentary occupations than
during the Early Caddo period, but there is no
evidence for substantial changes in subsistence
(such as an increase in the importance of agriculture). The subsistence evidence, the fact
that sites continued to be occupied by single
small social groups, the lack of mounds, and
the absence of elaborate mortuary behavior all
indicate continuity with the Early Caddo period,
with the upper Sulphur River basin groups not
as fully integrated into the Caddo culture as
their neighbors.
As for the preceding period, the Red River
valley of northwest Louisiana saw intensive
occupation during the Middle and Late Caddo
Bossier and Belcher foci. Mound centers have
been documented at sites such as Belcher,
Vanceville, and Werner, and residential sites
have been found in both upland and floodplain
settings (Kelley 2006:21–24; Rogers and Perttula
2004:27). Rogers and Perttula (2004:27) summarize some of Girard’s observations by saying
that “First, settlements consist of linear clusters
of households on distributary streams (or old
channels) of the river, with several areas that
‘were relatively densely inhabited’. There are
also settlements along river swamps and marshes near the mouths of tributary streams. After

a.d.

1500, settlements became more dispersed
along oxbow streams.”
Moving south of the current study area, the
remains of Middle and Late Caddo occupations
are numerous and widespread. The Washington
Square Mound site in Nacogdoches County
appears to have been the “premier civic and
ceremonial center in the Angelina and Attoyac
River basins during the early portion of the
Middle Caddo period” (Rogers and Perttula
2004:28–29). Although there is little evidence of
a village immediately surrounding Washington
Square Mound, there are a number of probably
associated hamlets and small village sites such
as Tyson, Sawmill, and Blount that have been
documented (Rogers and Perttula 2004:28–29).
Late Caddo residential sites are even more
common, and much of the region from Toledo
Bend Lake west across Attoyac Bayou and the
Angelina River to the Neches River supported
a sizable population of settled farmers (Kelley
2006:23–24; Rogers and Perttula 2004:395–396).
There is ample evidence for intensive use
of the middle Sabine River basin during the
Middle and Late Caddo periods. The extensively excavated Oak Hill Village site occupied
mainly between a.d. 1150 and 1450 yielded
evidence of over 40 structures associated with
five building episodes (Rogers and Perttula
2004:49). A variety of pit and hearth features
were also identified within the village area
both inside and outside structures. Of 84 small
pits excavated, 32 produced corn and provide
an indication of the ubiquity of this cultigen at
the site (Rogers and Perttula 2004:97–107). In
their discussion of the regional context for Oak
Hill Village, Rogers and Perttula (2004:23–26)
include five comparable large habitation sites or
villages along the Sabine and its tributaries at
the intersection of Rusk, Panola and Harrison
Counties. These villages cover 3 to 8 acres and
usually include a communal midden and small
cemetery or mound.
Recent work at the South Hallsville/South
Marshall Mine in Harrison County on the north
side of the Sabine River has identified numerous
sites constituting the Pine Tree Mound community, which was occupied from the a.d. 1300s
to perhaps the mid 1600s (Dockall et al. 2008,
2010, 2011; Fields and Gadus 2012; Gadus et al.
2006; Wilder et al. 2007). The focal point of this
community was the Pine Tree Mound site, a ceremonial center with three earthen mounds that
29

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
once supported structures, areas with off-mound
structures, a plaza, and at least one high-status
cemetery. Residential areas surround the core
ceremonial area and are scattered down Potters
Creek and across adjacent stream valleys, and
a secondary ceremonial center with four or five
small mounds, the Lane Mitchell site, is on
Hatley Creek near where it enters the Sabine
River floodplain. The village areas appear to
have contained only a house or two at any one
time, with many houses having been rebuilt several times. The village areas also contain small
cemeteries. Fields and Gadus (2012) suggest
that the Pine Tree Mound community equates to
the home territory of the Nadaco, or Nondacao,
Caddo, who were documented in this part of
the Sabine basin as early as a.d. 1542 and as
late as a.d. 1788, and that this community was
affiliated with Titus phase groups living in the
Cypress basin to the north.
In Fields and Gadus’s (2012:661, 663)
view, the south side of the middle Sabine basin,
including the current project area, was within
the bounds of the Pine Tree Mound community
but was sparsely settled compared to the north
side of the river, perhaps serving as a buffer
zone between that community and ones in
the Neches River basin to the south. Perttula
(2004b:40) has suggested that the Caddo may
have abandoned parts of the region by the
a.d. 1400s, only returning in any numbers by the
a.d. 1700s. Recent survey and testing in Rusk
Permit Area V (Dockall et al. 2010, 2011) do indicate some settlement there during that period,
though, especially near where the Hasinai Trace
emerged from the Sabine River floodplain in the
vicinity of Hendricks Lake.

1978:3). Caddo groups that the Spanish explorers encountered as they traversed the Cypress
Creek and middle Sabine River drainages included the Nissohone, Lacane, and Nondacao
(Perttula 1992:21).
The village and cemetery sites with
European trade goods that are known to occur
in the middle Sabine area, dating mainly to the
eighteenth century (and well after the entrada)
are near Trammel’s Trace and have been given
the name Kinsloe phase (Jones 1968). Fields and
Gadus (2012:639–634) suggest that at least some
of the Kinsloe sites could have been occupied by
descendants of the Pine Tree Mound community,
perhaps augmented by other immigrant Caddo
groups, but the people who created these sites
eventually may have become part of the Hasinai
confederacy, which was focused to the south along
the upper Neches and Angelina Rivers (Perttula
1992:166–177). This confederacy, along with the
Kadohadacho confederacy near the Great Bend
of the Red River, were amalgamations of remnant
Caddo groups that began to form ca. a.d. 1700.
These confederacies were successful for a time
in taking advantage of the Spanish and French
contention for control of east Texas. But they,
too, continued to contract in population size and
area occupied due to the pressures of disease and
competition for traditional resources with other
displaced Native American groups. This competition was exacerbated when Euro-Americans
began to settle east Texas. By 1834, the Caddo
relinquished their rights to territory within the
United States. They were pushed from their
traditional homeland and by 1860 were residing in Indian Territory, later to become part of
Oklahoma (Swanton 1942:89–113).

Historic Caddo Period:
a.d. 1680–1834

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The study area, northwest of Tatum in Rusk
County, includes extant historic buildings, structures, and sites that date from the late nineteenth
through mid-twentieth centuries. To provide a
context for understanding these resources, a brief
history is presented, with emphasis on information pertinent to the study area.

At the time of historic contact, the Caddo
people included some 25 closely affiliated
groups settled along the Great Bend of the Red
River and extending into the Piney Woods of
northeast Texas. Europeans had first entered
northeast Texas in a.d. 1542 as part of the De
Soto entrada. The entrada probably followed
an ancient trail known as the Hasinai Trace,
later known as Trammel’s Trace, that passed
through the eastern part of the Rusk Permit
(Dockall et al. 2011:128–129; Fields 2008; Gadus
et al. 2006:133; Perttula et al. 1986:184; Wedel

Early Settlement and the
Antebellum Years
Settlement by Anglo Americans of the part
of east Texas that would become Rusk County
30

Chapter 2: Archeological and Historical Background
more than 80,000 improved acres (Knapp and
Biesele 2013).
The study area includes land out of five surveys located in the antebellum era that totaled
more than 10,000 acres, some of which would not
be settled until after the Civil War. The earliest
and largest patents—4,428.4 acres each—went
to Thomas O’Bar and Russel Williamson in
1835 (Texas General Land Office 1835a, 1835b).
Later and smaller patents followed with 318
acres to John A. Gray in 1848, 640 acres to the
heirs of Edward Simon in 1851, and 369 acres
to Seaborn J. Hendrick in 1854 (Texas General
Land Office 1848, 1851, 1854). None of these
landowners occupied these properties, but, with
the exception of the Williamson Survey, which
remained unoccupied well into the twentieth
century, they were sold to incoming settlers who
established farms. The earliest known settlers
in the study area were Virginia natives James
Madison (1810–1880) and Margaret M. Gladney
Langhorne (1817–1882), who had a plantation
on the O’Bar Survey in the 1840s. Benjamin G.
and Virginia Hill Pace Kelly had a plantation
that included the Freeman Survey, part of the
Simon Survey, and the adjacent John Webster
Survey in the 1850s; they continued to live in
the study area until the early 1890s. For the
most part, the Simon Survey, along with other
adjacent land, was part of the Levi Hill and
Elizabeth H. Vinson Ware plantation in the
1850s and was held by their heirs for many
decades. The Williamson and O’Bar Surveys
belonged to prominent local plantation owner
and politician James Winwright Flanagan for
many years. Flanagan lived with his family
on Robertson Boulevard in Henderson at their
family home, Mizner Hill, from the mid to late
nineteenth century (Cutrer 2013; Rusk County
Depot Museum n.d.). In addition to his political
pursuits, he also initiated small-scale local industrial developments and owned a substantial
amount of land. By about 1860, he owned and
was operating a tannery, sawmill, and gristmill
(Johnson 1996a; Von Rosenberg 1863). His entrepreneurial ventures included the small town
named for him, just outside the northeast edge of
the study area. John Phelps and his sons, Ashton
and William A., of New Orleans acquired the
O’Bar Survey in 1882 and subdivided the land
during the following decade. The southern twothirds of the survey was broken into 92 similarly
sized small rectangles along which roads were

began slowly in the 1830s, spurred by the
Mexican government’s issuance of land grants.
After 1836, the Republic of Texas lifted land
restrictions, and affordable land prices enticed
droves of new settlers. Most new immigrants
arrived from states east of the Mississippi
River, particularly Tennessee, Georgia, North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Alabama. These
southern agriculturists brought slaves with
them and established a plantation society. They
traveled to the area by way of Trammel’s Trace,
which Nicholas Trammel created in 1813 along
preexisting Indian trails between Nacogdoches
and the Red River (Knapp and Biesele 2013;
Pirtle 2013). The trace extended south from the
Ramsdale’s Ferry crossing of the Sabine River
generally along the Panola–Rusk County line.
As more settlers arrived from the American
South, the Republic of Texas Congress subdivided Nacogdoches County into smaller political
divisions. In 1843, Rusk County was carved out
as a separate entity. Although small towns such
as Camden and Harmony Hill were already
established, the newly formed municipality
lacked a central settlement to serve as the center
of government. Settler General James Smith
donated 65.5 acres for the town of Henderson,
which was named for his friend, James Pinckney
Henderson (1808–1858), a statesman, soldier,
and first governor of the State of Texas (Elliot
2013; Knapp and Biesele 2013).
The population of Rusk County swelled
during the antebellum era, and agriculture was
the foremost economic activity. In 1850, Rusk
County was the second most-populated county
in the state, behind only Harrison County to the
north. Of its 8,148 people, 26 percent were slaves
(DeBow 1854:314). The county’s 567 farms had
27,500 improved acres that year, and the dominant row crops were corn, oats, peas and beans,
and sweet potatoes. Local farms produced 2,659
bales of ginned cotton weighing 400 pounds each.
The 20,221 swine, the major protein source of
the era, were the most common livestock, and
3,073 dairy cows supplied other essential provisions. The 7,908 beef cattle were likely raised for
both food and to sell at market; the 1,859 sheep
were raised for their wool and meat. Beasts of
burden—2,031 horses, 449 asses and mules,
and 1,442 oxen—provided transportation and
power for plowing, hauling, and grinding grain
(DeBow 1853:515–520). By 1858, the county
was among the wealthiest in Texas and had
31

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
developed. The Chrystal Farms Road, which
appears to wend north-south along the east edge
of the O’Bar Survey, was designated by the late
nineteenth century, although there is no known
explanation for this name.
By 1860, Rusk County had become the
most-populated county in Texas, and its agricultural economy continued to thrive. The
county had 9,670 Anglo Americans and 6,132
slaves, 39 percent of the population (Campbell
1989:110–114; U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1864a:475, 481, 485). On their
100,037 improved acres, local farmers produced
653,563 bushels of corn, 68,285 bushels of sweet
potatoes, 27,783 bushels of oats, and 11,791 bales
of ginned cotton. Livestock numbers generally
had increased similarly since 1850, with 34,565
swine, 6,075 dairy cows, 13,019 beef cattle, and
7,395 sheep. The number of work animals grew
also; however, the number of horses remained
relatively static at 2,031, compared to increased
numbers of asses and mules at 2,046, and oxen
at 2,142 (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1864b:144–147).
Most Rusk County residents supported
secession. The citizens voted to separate from
the Union by a 10-to-1 margin. Local families
sacrificed for the Confederate effort, contributing more troops than any other Texas county,
with at least 12 companies mustered from
Henderson (Knapp and Biesele 2013). By this
time, an influx of southerners had taken refuge
from their war-torn homelands to the east and
brought their slaves to Rusk County to protect
their investment and labor source (Campbell
1989:243–246).

Civil War, undertook a political career to support
the Republican cause. Serving as a U.S. senator
from 1869 to 1875, he was the last Republican
senator from Texas until 1960 (Cutrer 2013;
Spaw 1999:98). In doing so, he helped shelter
the area from meddlesome radicals and avoided
local provisional or military rule experienced
elsewhere in much of the American South
during Reconstruction (Knapp and Biesele 2013;
Moneyhon 2001; Ramsdell 1910). This proved
beneficial to local Anglo Americans families,
who retained their assets, economic control,
and political power, and prevented freedmen
from receiving government support that federal
occupation might have provided.
As was true for much of Texas, the railroads
played a significant role in rebuilding the local
economy in the 1870s and 1880s. In 1872, the
first railroad, the International–Great Northern,
came through Overton, in Rusk County’s northwest corner. Five years later, the 16-mile-long
Henderson and Overton Branch Railway connected the county seat to the International–
Great Northern Railway; the larger company
acquired the local line in 1880 (Reed 2013). The
Longview and Sabine Valley Railway, intended to
connect Longview with Sabine Pass on the Gulf
Coast, had a narrow-gauge line that extended
11 miles southward to Camden by 1878. Locally
harvested lumber dominated the freight hauled
on this line. As part of this railroad’s extension,
tracks (Resource 22) laid through the study area
connected Longview to Carthage via Tatum,
founded in the 1840s just southeast of the study
area. The railroad founded the community of
Flanagan, near the northeast edge of the study
area, in 1882. The Galveston, Sabine and St. Louis
Railway bought the railroad in the study area in
1883. By 1885, the line had 11 more miles that
terminated near Tatum. Most of the tracks were
upgraded to standard gauge in the late 1880s. The
line, however, sought receivership and became the
Texas, Sabine Valley and Northwestern Railway
in 1887. About 1904, the railroad was sold to the
Texas and Gulf Railway, which was subsumed
in 1906 by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
Railway. The latter company leased the line to
the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway, and
in 1948 these two companies merged (Biesele
2013a; Hilton 1990:545; Knapp and Biesele 2013;
Perry 2013; Werner 2013; Young 2013a, 2013b).
The railroad exposed the study area to more and
larger markets.

The Postbellum Years
Although Rusk County escaped violence
and occupation during the Civil War, economic
depression and social changes befell the area.
Without slaves, landholders were compelled to
hire labor. Reduced property values diminished
the fortunes of most Anglo American planters
and farmers. Freedmen fared no better. Seeking
to improve their conditions, most freedmen could
only find work as sharecroppers. The county
escaped long-term federal occupation during
Reconstruction in part because former local
slaveholder James Winwright Flanagan (1805–
1887), who had both discouraged secession and
contributed to the Confederate cause during the
32

Chapter 2: Archeological and Historical Background
but some in the study area were able to acquire
property and participate in the agricultural
economy. George W. and Mary Waldon Mann,
both natives of Georgia, purchased a 212-acre
parcel out of the O’Bar Survey in 1884 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 32:349). The property was
relatively remote at the west end of a small
road (Texas State Highway Department 1940).
There they farmed and raised their children,
four of whom—George Jr., Willis, Earnest, and
Minnie—would occupy their property for several
decades. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, the
Manns typically had a wagon, a few equine, several bovine and hogs, and up to 25 goats. They
also had at least $5 and miscellaneous property
valued at up to $25, indicating relative success
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). At one
time, three house sites (41RK676/Resource 6,
41RK679, and 41RK682) were on the land, representing the family’s development of the property
and persistence into the early 1940s. Native
Tennesseans Green and Harriet Robertson
farmed 59 acres out of the Freeman Survey, on
which 41RK736 is situated, that he purchased
for $295 in 1886 (Rusk County, Deed Record
34:73). They usually had a few equine, up to 20
bovine, as many as 20 swine, and miscellaneous
property valued at $5 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records). At the age of 88, Robertson sold
the property in 1916 (Rusk County, Deed Record
84:258; U.S. Department of Commerce and
Labor, Bureau of the Census 1910).
By 1890, a slight decline in population did
not prevent increased agricultural production in
Rusk County. The Anglo American population in
the county was 10,926, and the African American
population was 7,624 (U.S. Department of the
Interior, Census Office 1895a:432). The county
had 2,793 farms, of which 62 percent were owner
cultivated and 35 percent were sharecropped,
with the small remainder being rented. Sixtyfour percent of owner-occupied farms had 100
to 500 acres, while 43 percent of sharecropped
farms had 20 to 50 acres. However, a fair-sized
portion—24 percent—of sharecropped farms
had 100 to 500 acres. Corn production was up
from the previous decennial at 590,609 bushels on 43,885 acres, and oat production had
increased to 73,521 bushels on 7,691 acres.
Cotton production remained relatively stable
with 12,120 ginned bales on 49,590 acres. The
county had 7,104 working livestock, 36,539
swine, and 6,815 dairy cows (U.S. Department

By 1870, Rusk County’s Anglo American
population had declined slightly to 9,201, but
its African American population had grown to
7,715 (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1872a:65–66). Of the county’s 1,541 farms,
45 percent had 20 to 50 acres, 27 percent had
50 to 100 acres, and 20 percent had 100 to 500
acres. Improved acreage declined from the previous decennial to 78,250 acres. Consequently,
crop production suffered and only 347,561
bushels of corn and 6,956 bushels of oats were
harvested. Sweet potato production rose slightly to 73,556 bushels, and production of ginned
cotton increased 21 percent with 12,752 bales
weighing 450 pounds each. On average, a farm
might have 14 swine, 2 or 3 bovine, and 2 or 3
equine (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1872b:258–261, 363).
By 1880, the Anglo American population
in Rusk County had grown to 10,807, and the
African American population had grown to
8,169 (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1883a:410). The county had 2,256 farms,
of which 65 percent were owner cultivated,
33 percent were sharecropped, and the small
remainder were rented. Owner-cultivated
farms tended to be larger than those that were
sharecropped or rented. In fact, 66 percent of
owner-occupied farms had 100 to 500 acres, but
55 percent of sharecropped farms only had 20 to
50 acres. Improved land had returned to 1860
levels with 100,635 acres in use or cultivation.
Corn production was relatively static from the
previous decennial at 367,706 bushels, but
oat production had escalated to 30,953 bushels. On average, a farm typically had 14 or 15
swine, 2 or 3 dairy cows, and 2 equine. Cotton
production fell slightly to 11,143 ginned bales
(U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1883b: 92–93, 136, 172, 207, 244). Some farmers,
such as James W. (1849–1900) and Pheobe Ann
McMurtry (1848–1929) Kuykendall, were considerably more successful. They had purchased
120 acres out of the Simon Survey, on which
41RK734 and 41RK735 are situated, in 1878
for $223 (Anonymous 2009b; Anonymous 2010g;
Rusk County, Deed Record 29:541). They lived
on their farm for 22 years and typically had 1
or 2 equine and a wagon but up to 11 bovine, 30
swine, and 50 goats (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records 1887, 1888, 1889).
Many freedmen were sharecroppers or, at
best, tenant farmers in the era of Reconstruction,

al land in the vicinity and owned more than
500 acres by 1905 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records).
The growing number of sawmills in the
vicinity used Flanagan as a shipping point for
lumber (Hilton 1990:545; Perry 2013; Young
2013a, 2013b). James M. Oden and his young
son, Haywood C. Oden, briefly operated the
Panola Lumber Company from Flanagan. They
purchased the Dealy Lumber Company’s sawmill and took over their 25-year lease in 1905.
Oden also occupied the property for this short
period and held other land in the study area
between at least 1902 and 1908 (Rusk County,
Deed Records 54:99, 61:151). In 1906, the Odens
sold the mill property to the Sabine River
Lumber and Logging Company, part of the New
South Lumber Company, which operated the old
Flanagan sawmill as a rough-and-finish lumber
mill from 1905 to at least 1914. Sabine River
and Lumber and Logging Company was still
purchasing timberland in the Flanagan vicinity
in 1912 and 1914 (Johnson 1996a, 1996b; Rusk
County, Deed Record 61:151).
As logging and milling activity dissipated
in the early twentieth century, Flanagan’s population decreased The small company town had a
post office by 1900 and a population of 69 in 1905
(Biesele 2013b). Population estimates, which
included the surrounding area, had reached 200
by 1914. That year, businessmen in Flanagan
included postmaster J. L. Bowman and Wells
Fargo and Company agent and farmer Clarence
R. Flanagan (R. L. Polk & Company 1914). The
post office was discontinued in 1916, and by 1923
the town had only 10 residents (Biesele 2013b;
R. L. Polk & Company 1923).

of the Interior, Census Office 1895b: 186–187,
309, 350, 387, 397). In summary, Rusk County
experienced consistently regular population
growth and agricultural expansion through the
late nineteenth century.
Reflecting the county’s various-sized farms,
landholdings in the study area also varied in the
1890s. Of African Americans in the study area,
the Manns were the largest landholders with
212 acres. Lazarus and Emilie Cato purchased
a parcel of almost 100 acres out of the O’Bar
Survey, on which 41RK690 is situated, in 1896
for $1,000 (Rusk County, Deed Records 46:36,
155:437). The property was west of Flanagan.
Despite the purchase price, the land’s appraisal
value never rose above $300 in the 1890s, although twentieth-century assessments would
increase slightly. Their livestock holdings supported the family’s food needs with a few bovine
and swine. They also had two or three equine,
several goats, and a wagon. After his 1901 death,
his widow continued to occupy the property into
the 1930s, farming it with the help of her son and
daughter-in-law, Sam and Luverter Cato, and
seven of their children (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records). Smaller holdings belonged to the
Robertsons, with 59 acres, and their neighbor to
the north, Robert Lunsford, who had purchased
30 acres out of the Freeman Survey in 1891
(Rusk County, Deed Record 83:239). He lived
there with his wife, Lizzie, until his 1904 death.
Without working livestock for several years,
no swine, and only one or two dairy cows most
years, their income was meager (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). Peter Johnson had
acquired 40 acres out of the Freeman Survey, on
which 41RK721 and 41RK722 are situated, in
1892. There, he and his wife operated their small
farm (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
Anglo American landholders in the study
area were more likely to have larger landholdings. For example, Walter C. and Eunice
Cleopatra Stroud Robinson purchased a 276acre parcel out of the O’Bar Survey in 1890 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 39:116). The Robinsons also
owned other land parcels at the time, although
they gradually decreased their holdings by
the time of his 1909 death to 222 acres (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). Ansel Walter
Capps purchased a 212-acre parcel out of the
O’Bar Survey, on which 41RK696 and 41RK711
are situated, in 1892 (Rusk County, Deed Record
42:353). Capps gradually acquired addition-

Into the Twentieth Century
Between 1900 and 1940, the population and
agricultural economies of Rusk County evolved.
The population rose over time, declining 22 percent between 1900 and 1910, increasing 55 percent in the following decennial, and soaring
another 57 percent between 1930 and 1940 (U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
1922:1,010, 1932:1,378, 1943a:803, 847; U.S.
Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau
of the Census 1913a:838; U.S. Department of
the Interior, Census Office 1901:41, 560). A notable population spike occurred between 1930
and 1936 at the initiation of the local oil and
34

Chapter 2: Archeological and Historical Background
natural gas industry, and then receded (Knapp
and Biesele 2013). During this last decade, the
African American population grew only 13 percent as compared to a 90 percent increase in the
Anglo American population.
A notable change in the study area came
with the founding of the Zion Hill Cemetery
in 1901. Two Anglo American property owners,
former slaveholder Benjamin G. Kelly and
neighbor James Kuykendall, sold 5 acres out of
the Freeman Survey to the Zion Hill Missionary
Baptist Church, as it was originally known
(Rusk County, Deed Records 81:138, 100:168).
A cemetery (41RK724/Resource 30C) was also
established. In 1919, the congregation, known
as the Zion Hill Colored Baptist Church by
that time, allowed for a school to be part of the
property (Rusk County, Deed Record 100:168).
It is unknown whether a separate building was
constructed or if the school operated out of the
church building. Another neighbor sold 2 acres
to the church in 1926 (Rusk County, Deed Record
129:598). The Masonic Brothers Lodge #184
used the building as a lodge in the 1950s (Rusk
County, Deed Record 462:373). A ca. 1970 church
(Resource 30A) and small outbuilding (Resource
30B) remain extant on the property today.
The intensity and value of agriculture in
Rusk County also changed, particularly during
the Great Depression. The number of farms
grew markedly, with a spike between 1910 and
1920, until 1940, when the county lost 2,146—
one-third—of its farms (U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1925:126,
149, 177, 193; U.S. Department of Commerce
and Labor, Bureau of the Census 1913b:650,
673, 69). In 1930, the average farm size spiraled
downward to a low of 69 acres (U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1932:1,378,
1,398, 1,463, 1,483, 1,559). That average had
risen substantially by 1940, to 95 acres (U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
1943a:803, 847, 1943b:246). As was the case
elsewhere in the state, this was in part because
farmers with smaller holdings were forced to
cease operations and those with larger holdings
were able to hang on through the economic trials
of the preceding decade. Another factor was the
move toward consolidation and agribusiness
that would come to fruition in the second half
of the twentieth century. About 60 percent of
farm operations in Rusk County were Anglo
American concerns, and 40 percent were African

American. Ownership and tenancy remained
relatively constant, with a dip in ownership and
a spike in tenancy in 1930 (U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1925:126, 149,
177, 193, 1932:1,378, 1,398, 1,463, 1,483, 1,559,
1943a:803, 847, 1943b:246; U.S. Department
of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of the Census
1913b:650, 673, 696).
This spike was evident in the study
area, which became home to several Anglo
American and African America farm families
that would persist for decades. Land-owning
Anglo American families included those of
Thomas M. and Helen M. Kinsey, who occupied a
27-acre parcel out of the O’Bar Survey, on which
41RK699/Resources 18A and 18B are situated,
beginning in 1911 (Rusk County, Deed Record
72:109). The Kinseys acquired other nearby
land over the years but considered this part of
their homestead until 1940 (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records). Immediately to the west,
Will F. and Lola Bell Welch purchased a 25.37acre parcel out of the O’Bar Survey, on which
41RK710/Resource 17 is situated, in 1912, and
likely lived on the property until 1928 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 50:609). North of Tatum,
Alan N. and Effie Helvenston purchased land
out of the Simon Survey, on which 41RK732 and
41RK733 are situated, in 1916, where they lived
until the mid 1960s (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records; Rusk County, Deed Record 92:146).
Robert Owen and Nora A. Graham Kuykendall
began to amass a large farmstead in the study
area in the 1910s, some of which they occupied
until his 1937 death. Their lands included four
adjoining parcels out of the O’Bar Survey, including the 212-acre parcel on which 41RK696
is situated, a 156-acre parcel out of the nearby
John A. Gray Survey on which 41RK697 is
situated, and other lands (Rusk County, Deed
Records 99:319, 100:546; 101:240, 110:77–79;
113:103; 115:457, 126:301, 250:579, 581).
African American landowners were more
numerous in the study area during this period,
although they generally owned fewer acres.
One occupation of brief tenure was that of
Green and Harriet Ann Henry, who purchased
66 acres out of the Freeman Survey, on which
41RK718/Resource 29 is situated, in 1909 and
1910 (Rusk County, Deed Records 72:151, 154).
By 1912, however, he was deceased, and his
widow sold the land (Rusk County, Deed Record
73:1). Willis Mann had inherited land from his
35

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
was also the first mayor of the small community (Rusk County Historical Commission
1982:303). Menefee owned land out of several
surveys in Rusk County and lived in Tatum
(U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor,
Bureau of the Census 1910; U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1920,
1930b, 1940; U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1900a). His rural holdings were
appraised at $12,525 in 1908 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). After his first wife’s
death in about 1908, he married Anna Vinson
(1877–1940) (Medlin 2009a; Rusk County, Deed
Record 448:244). That year, he owned several
parcels of land appraised at $8,810, 20 equine,
10 bovine, 10 swine, and 3 wagons or carriages,
and had $3,715 in merchandise, other wares, or
miscellaneous personal property (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). His landholdings in
the study area grew to include at least two parcels out of the O’Bar Survey—the 100 acres on
which 41RK684 is situated and the 103 acres
on which the Eddie B. and Argustus Bradley
farmstead (41RK700) is situated—plus 66 acres
out of the Freeman Survey on which the Green
and Harriet Ann Henry farmstead (41RK718/
Resource 29) is situated and 112 acres out of
the Simon Survey on which the James W. and
Pheobe Ann McMurtry Kuykendall farmstead
(41RK734) is situated (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records; Rusk County, Deed Records 54:598,
57:598, 73:1, 76:117, 125:61–62, 267:216). With
improvements extant on these properties in the
1930s, they were likely tenant occupied at that
time (Tobin International 1930; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939). Improvements
remained in some of these locations in the
1960s and likely represented continued tenant
occupation (U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service 1960). Property out of the Simon
Survey that belonged to the Flanagan family for
many years was the likely location of a tenant
farmstead at 41RK723, where improvements
remained in the 1930s. Similarly, the Flanagan
family owned 1,704 acres out of the Williamson
Survey until 1937, and it remained undeveloped;
the subsequent owner also did not occupy the
land, so improvements that appeared there in
1930s and 1960 aerial photographs likely reflect
tenant occupancy. Although it was probably established earlier, a farmstead that became part

parents, bought property from his siblings, and
in 1914 purchased 100 acres out of the O’Bar
Survey, on which 41RK702 is situated, near
his other holdings (Rusk County, Deed Record
95:150). Willis and Georgia Mann and their heirs
owned this land for decades (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records). In 1915, Manuel James
Sr. purchased an almost 50-acre parcel out of the
O’Bar Survey, on which 41RK730/Resource 42
is situated (Rusk County, Deed Records 84:53,
1408:576, 1429:269). He and his wife, Johanna
Norris James, raised their family on this land
and lived there until their deaths (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Deed Records). Peter Johnson’s
daughter-in-law, Emmie Johnson, owned his 40acre parcel, on which 41RK721 and 41RK722 are
situated, by 1916 and lived there for the rest of
her life (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records.)
Widowed in 1918, George Ann Guice continued
to live on 59 acres out of the Freeman Survey
that her husband had purchased from Green
Robertson in 1916 (Rusk County, Deed Record
84:258). She married James Menefee, and they
claimed the property as their homestead into the
1940s (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
Jim Carter had acquired a 30-acre parcel out of
the Freeman Survey, on which 41RK720 is situated, by 1916. He occupied it and a nearby parcel
for many decades (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records). Eddie B. and Argustus Bradley were
one of the few African American farm owners in
the study area that did not stay on their land
for more than a decade. They occupied a 39acre parcel out of the O’Bar Survey, on which
41RK700 is situated, from 1917 to 1924.
Tenancy was not especially prominent in
the study area during the nineteenth or the
twentieth century, although cases did occur.
From the 1890s through the 1910s, Albert Olin
Menefee (1865–1942) purchased rural property there (Groves 2013a). Menefee was born
in Alabama and living with his four siblings,
mother, and stepfather in Rusk County by 1880
(U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1880a). He and his first wife, native Texan
Effie Gladney Menefee (1867–1908), married
in 1891 and had five children who survived to
adulthood (Groves 2013b; Rusk County, Deed
Records 294:299–300; Rusk County Historical
Commission 1982:303; U.S. Department of
the Interior, Census Office 1880a). He had
attended medical school at Tulane University
and practiced medicine in Tatum. Menefee
36

Chapter 2: Archeological and Historical Background
front-gable bungalows (Resources 7, 21, 32, 36,
39B, and 39C) and side-gable cottages (Resource
39A), were common in the study area during the
1920s and 1930s.
The nineteenth-century road system in the
study area remained remarkably unchanged well
into the twentieth century. Along its east side,
the Tatum-to-Easton Road roughly paralleled
the path of the southeast-northwest Galveston,
Sabine and St. Louis Railway. Other roads decidedly follow the outlines of the Freeman and
Gray Surveys and the west edge of the Simon
Survey (Texas State Highway Department 1940,
1961; Edgar Tobin Aerial Surveys 1957). Roads
wend through the northern portion of the O’Bar
Survey and lead to each of the larger, irregularly
shaped subdivisions within it. Two east-west
roads (present-day County Roads 2194/2195 and
2199) in the southern portion are along property lines created when late-nineteenth-century
subdivision took place; a third east-west road
(41RK715) is no longer extant. A north-south
road (present-day County Road 2194) bisects
the section, and the Chrystal Farms Road wraps
around the eastern edge. The earliest route of
State Highway 149 traversed east-west between
Tatum and Stewart, south of the study area. By
1958, this route was designated FM 1797, and
a new 34-mile-long state highway routed from
northwest to southeast between Longview and
Carthage via Tatum and Beckville had been
constructed (Texas State Highway Department
1940, 1961; U.S. Geological Survey 1958). This
road abuts the south edge of the study area.
The lumber industry had added wealth
to the economies of Rusk County since the
nineteenth century, but the discovery of minerals caused a boom that continues today. In
1930, Columbus M. “Dad” Joiner discovered
oil 8 miles east of Henderson, causing a local
boom. Farmers, focused on cashing in through
lease arrangements or royalties, abandoned
their waiting crops in the fields. New residents
poured into the county to strike it rich in the oil
business. Some communities and settlements
transformed into bustling centers of commerce
with supporting infrastructure, like electricity
(Resource 11) and other utilities, while others
disappeared completely. Oil and natural gas
production continues to thrive with natural
gas wells (Resources 1, 4, and 5) dotting and
pipelines (Resources 12 and 33) crossing the
study area. In addition, the county’s economy

of the James “Jim” Cannon Kuykendall property
in the O’Bar Survey by 1916, at the location of
41RK716, was likely tenant occupied into the
1930s. (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records;
Tobin International 1930; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1960).
Corn and cotton were the dominant crops
in Rusk County during this period. Corn production peaked in 1920, since, with the gradual
introduction of vehicular transportation and
other power sources for farm work, feed crops
for working livestock became increasingly unnecessary. Correspondingly, a drop in the proportion of working livestock took place—although
true mechanization would not prevail until
the 1950s—and mules were more numerous
than horses by 1930. Home processing of meat
products decreased as the century progressed,
and by 1940 Rusk County had 62 percent fewer
swine. A small local dairy industry allowed for
a 24 percent increase in dairy cows between the
turn of the century and 1940, but the number of
dairy cattle had peaked in the interceding decades. The heartbreaking love affair with cotton
played out in Rusk County as it did in all of the
American South. Peak production was in 1930,
but the many risks of this crop proved deleterious too many times and the number of acres
and bales dropped after that (U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1932, 1942,
1943b; U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor,
Bureau of the Census 1913b; U.S. Department of
the Interior, Census Office 1902a, 1902b).
Development of more farmsteads in the
study area occurred in the 1920s and 1930s. In
1925, James F. Williams established a farmstead
on 100 acres out of the O’Bar Survey, on which
41RK688 and 41RK701 are situated, where
he lived with his family until his 1933 death
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records; Rusk
County, Deed Record 105:3). Will F. and Lola
Bell Welch established a farm on land out of
the O’Bar Survey, on which 41RK710 is situated, and lived there from 1912 to 1928 (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records; Rusk County,
Deed Record 50:609). They conveyed the land
to Emmett F. Beall in 1928, who lived on the
farmstead until about 1940 (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records, Rusk County, Deed Record
241:528). Modest wood-frame houses, such as
37

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
has gradually diversified to include metal-plate
fabricating, agribusiness, lumbering, manufacturing of brick and tile, and lignite mining
(Knapp and Biesele 2013). From the 1940s
through the 1970s, many rural landholdings
were subdivided into “ranchettes” (Resources
3, 8, 9, 10A–B, 15, 23A, 24–27, 34, 35, 37, 40,
41, and 43–48), each with a small amount of
land, a house, and a few outbuildings. Houses
on these properties were very modest and
usually incorporated Minimal Traditional,

Minimal Ranch, or Ranch bungalow stylistic
influences (see Chapter 5 for details on these
stylistic influences). Associated improvements
included livestock tanks (Resources 2, 14A, 16,
28), barns (Resources 13, 23B, 38H/41RK690),
corrals (Resource 14B, 31/41RK700, and
38F/41RK690), and feed troughs (Resource
38G/41RK690). A longing for the past remains,
however, and several old buildings have either
been moved to their current locations or rebuilt
of old materials (Resources 19, 20A–D).

GEOMORPHIC SETTINGS

some distance back (south) from the valley wall
and have their origins in the dissected uplands.
Only the Cherokee Bayou floodplain proper has
any appreciable amount of deposits mapped
as Quaternary alluvium (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1975). Elevations average about 240 ft
above mean sea level and generally vary only a
few feet above and below this at most. Uncleared
portions of the floodplain support mature and
secondary-growth hardwood forest with an open
to dense understory. Occasional loblolly pine
trees grow on well-drained topographic highs.
Today, the bottomlands are used mostly for
recreation (hunting and ATV use), oil and gas extraction, and timbering. The latter two of these,
in particular, have resulted in some disturbances, but they have impacted mostly the surface
and near-surface deposits. Unlike the Sabine
River floodplain and Pleistocene terraces to the
east, the Cherokee Bayou floodplain has not been
subjected to extensive pine replanting, but it has
been selectively thinned recently along much
of the course of the existing channel within the
project area. The thinned area includes terrain
on both sides of the channel but does not extend
to the valley wall to the south. Disturbance is
limited since only selected trees like bald cypress
and some oaks have been targeted, but the activity did involve mechanical felling and bunching
of cut trees with localized debris piles, skid roads,
and areas of churned surface deposits. In some
instances, there is evidence of surface dragging
of felled timber over short distances. Over a
dozen gas well pads and related facilities are
on the floodplain, connected by pipelines and
access roads atop introduced fill or cut through
low rises. Portions of two major pipelines and
an electrical transmission line corridor traverse

Three main geomorphic settings comprise
the project area: floodplain, Pleistocene terrace,
and uplands (see Figure 1.4). The 4,392-acre
survey area consists of 16 percent Cherokee
Bayou floodplain, 8 percent Pleistocene terrace
remnants, and 77 percent uplands. Included in
the uplands are valley wall settings, which are
the sloping interface between the uplands and
the floodplain or Pleistocene terraces.
Cherokee Bayou Floodplain
The active floodplain and bottomlands on
the north end of the project area are characterized by low-relief topography and many areas
of standing water in sloughs, back swamps,
tributary streams, and flood chutes with intervening slightly higher areas (Figure 3.1). This
geomorphic setting includes 689 acres. A total of
458 shovel tests were excavated in this setting
for a density of 1 test per 1.5 acres. Observed
high-water marks on trees indicate that large
areas are frequently inundated to a depth of a
meter or more. The channel of Cherokee Bayou
roughly defines the northern boundary of the
survey area. Cherokee Bayou is 13 km long
from the spillway and dam on Lake Cherokee
in Rusk County to where it drains into Black
Slough in Gregg County. For a portion of its
length, it represents the line between the two
counties. Within the northern portion of the
project area, the floodplain has meandering
tributary channels of at least six minor streams
that flow northward to Cherokee Bayou. Only
one of these, Watt Creek, is large enough to be
named, but there are four others that extend

Chapter 3: Project Area Description
the northwest portion of the floodplain from
southeast to northwest. These modern uses did
not significantly impede archeological survey
efforts, however, some areas of inundated floodplain just north of the south valley wall could not
be examined due to standing water and dense
secondary vegetation. The roads, pipelines, and
well pads provided good access to large sections
of floodplain for the survey crew and allowed it
to work around swampy vegetated terrain and
focus efforts on landforms more likely to contain
evidence of historic or prehistoric activity.
Soils on the Cherokee Bayou floodplain
include Laneville loam and Owentown fine
sandy loam with Mattex clay loam along the
bayou channel. Areas of Bienville loamy fine
sand are present on areas of slightly higher
topography and closer to the south valley wall
(Griffith 2000). Laneville soils are fluvaquentic
eutrochrepts with a dark A horizon above a B
horizon that has increased gleying with depth,
redoximorphic characteristics, and slickensides.
Owentown soils are fluventic dystrochrepts, also
with a dark A horizon above a B horizon with
variable presence of redoximorphic characteristics increasing with depth. Mattex soils are aeric
fluvaquents having a darker A horizon above a
B horizon with redoximorphic characteristics
increasing with depth and high clay content.
Bienville soils are paleudalfs with a dark A horizon above a lighter-colored E horizon and a dark
B horizon with no redoximorphic characteristics.
The soil types generally reflect their locations and distribution on the floodplain. Both
Laneville and Owentown soils are common on
alluvial flats, whereas Mattex soils are characteristic of floodplain mounds or topographic high
areas. Typically, these mounds are surrounded
by Owentown soils, and they are frequently
mapped together. Bienville loamy sands are
frequently present on terraces and stream
interfluves on the floodplain. Laneville and
Owentown soils are similar to soils on the Sabine
River floodplain to the east, with abundant
evidence of high water table, gleying, and other
redoximorphic characteristics. These characteristics made it impractical and unnecessary to
do any mechanical trenching to look for deeply
buried sites during survey, although trenching
likely should be a part of any testing program
at floodplain sites.
Levee deposits were observed on the floodplain along the channel of Cherokee Bayou

and larger tributary channels. Laneville soils
commonly occupy the levees and low mounded
areas along the channels and are formed by
processes associated with overbank flooding.
The small mounds or rises observed on the
floodplain should not be confused with pimple
mounds that Griffith (2000:169) notes as being
present within the Gallime-Alazan, MollvilleBesner, and Sawlit-Sawtown soil complexes. The
floodplain mounds are elliptical to irregularly
elongate in shape and typically only a meter or
so higher than the surrounding floodplain. The
origins of these small rises are not fully known,
but they may be stream terrace remnants or sediment accumulations around obstructions such
as exposed tree root balls or fallen trunks. They
usually have moderately deep to deep sandy or
silty soils and support vegetation characteristic
of well-drained areas such as loblolly pine, oak,
and occasionally even nettle. Shovel testing on
these small landforms demonstrated the welldrained character of the deposits on midslopes
and summits. Soil types are probably LanevilleMattex and areas of Bienville. These features are
large enough to be readily identified as potential
areas of prehistoric human activity.
Ten prehistoric sites represented by sparse
to moderate lithic debris and occasional expedient tools, biface fragments, projectile points, and
ceramics were found on elevated parts of the
floodplain during the Area W survey. The common
presence of prehistoric sites and isolated finds on
the Cherokee Bayou floodplain is distinctly different than the situation documented on the Sabine
River floodplain to the east during the Rusk
Permit Area V survey (Dockall et al. 2010:62–64).
Only 3 archeological sites were found on that
floodplain, 2 prehistoric and 1 historic (Trammel’s
Trace). The discovery of this many sites on the
Cherokee Bayou floodplain suggests that much
of the area has not seen substantial accumulation of sediment in historic and late prehistoric
times, although it is subject to frequent flooding.
It also indicates that prehistoric use of this floodplain environment is more easily documented by
conventional survey techniques compared to the
Sabine River floodplain.
Pleistocene Terraces
Unlike the Rusk Permit Area V to the
east, Area W has limited terrain representing
Pleistocene terraces, probably due to differences
41

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
in stream size between Cherokee Bayou and the
Sabine River and the younger age of Cherokee
Bayou. This geomorphic setting includes
336 acres of land. A total of 98 shovel tests were
excavated in this setting for a density of 1 test
per 3.4 acres. This landform is only apparent
in the central portion and northeast corner of
the project area. The latter is a continuation
of the large terrace system to the east and corresponds to where Cherokee Bayou flows into
the Sabine River. The terraces vary from ca.
200 m wide in the central area to 900 m in the
northeast corner. Landforms rise from 240 to
260 ft above mean sea level. Where the terraces
meet the Cherokee Bayou floodplain, the surface
topography includes toe slopes and lobe-shaped
ridges dissected by numerous small wet-weather
drainages and stream channels.
Soil types include Laneville loam, Latex
very fine sandy loam, Owentown fine sandy
loam, Sawlit-Sawtown complex, and Woodtell
loam. Owentown and Laneville soils are common
along the interface with the floodplain and can
be frequently flooded, while Latex, Woodtell,
and Sawlit-Sawtown soils occur on convex interstream divides and terrace settings. All are characterized by relatively shallow A horizons above
clay substrates. Shovel testing demonstrated
generally thin, eroded and gullied deposits above
B horizon clays in this setting.
The terraces are moderately to heavily
forested with secondary-growth trees and
moderately dense understory where they have
been previously logged. Much of the area has
been selectively thinned in the past. Portions of
the northeast section of terrace are presently
inhabited along the county roads in the area.
Overall, the terrace topography slopes down
gently but consistently to the north and did
not provide many suitable locations for prehistoric occupation. Only two sites were recorded
within a Pleistocene terrace area, 41RK727 and
41RK730; both are historic farmsteads.

mapped soils are Kirvin fine sandy loam and
Tenaha loamy fine sand. Both soil types present deep well-drained profiles, are common on
5–15 percent slopes, and typically support a
mixed woodlands environment. Shovel testing in
these areas confirmed the thick sandy soil profiles with the B horizon at depths approaching
or exceeding 1 m.
Many parts of the valley wall provide a panoramic view of the Cherokee Bayou floodplain,
potentially making this an advantageous setting
for prehistoric occupation. Sites in this setting
are 41RK672, 41RK674, 41RK675, 41RK686–
41RK688, 41RK693, 41RK705, 41RK706,
41RK711, and 41RK731; all but one have prehistoric components, while only two have historic
components. They are essentially on dissected
upland landforms.
Uplands
The uplands extend back from the valley wall
to the south edge of the project area. Including
the valley wall, uplands total 3,367 acres. Most of
the area has low to moderate relief, and much of
this part of the project area is open pasture used
for grazing livestock and hay production (Figure
3.3a). Substantial acreage is also in woodlands,
with some of this being pine plantation. This area
is characterized by broad, level to gently sloping
ridge tops at elevations of 330 to 385 ft cut by
the heads of generally intermittent drainages
feeding perennial narrow streams (Figure 3.3b).
These streams flow to the north and slightly
northeast. Areas along some of these upland
streams have steeper relief near interfluve
shoulders that could have provided vantage
points for prehistoric resource procurement. The
uplands are characterized by a mosaic of soil
types including three principal mapped soil units:
Cuthbert-Kirvin-Bowie, Tenaha-Lilbert-Darco,
and Sawlit-Sawtown-Latex. Broad patches of
upland area are dominated by a smaller number
of individual soil types: Latex very fine sandy
loam, Lilbert loamy fine sand, Bowie very fine
sandy loam, and Sawlit-Sawtown complex. Each
of these individual soil types is characterized by
slopes of less than 5 percent, and all of the main
mapped soil units are deep to moderately deep
well-drained sandy and loamy soils.
The uplands have seen minor disturbance
from logging and more-substantial impacts
from gas production, with 30 or more gas well

Valley Wall
The Cherokee Bayou valley wall, lying
south of the floodplain and Pleistocene terraces,
extends across the full width of the project area
and contains several areas of steeper blufflike
topography (Figure 3.2). The valley wall rises
from about 260 to 310 ft above mean sea level
over a distance of only 100 m or so. The main

pads and associated access roads and pipelines.
Typically, gas well pads have been sited on areas
of higher topography away from slopes and
drainages. In a number of cases, shovel testing
and survey of these locations yielded remnants
of prehistoric sites beyond the fringes of the well
pad clearance area.
The more-open nature of the vegetation
and less-intensive logging and pine replanting
compared to the uplands of the previously surveyed Rusk Permit Area V resulted in few impediments to survey and shovel testing. Survey
coverage of the upland (including the valley wall)
was achieved as planned and included excavation of 2,923 shovel tests, for a density of 1 test
for every 1.2 acres. Fifty-five percent (24 of 44)
of the sites with prehistoric components are in
the uplands back from the valley wall, all consisting of sparse scatters of lithic artifacts with
2 sites also having sparse ceramics. This also
is the setting for the vast majority (29 of 33, or
88 percent) of the sites with historic components.

or two well heads and average 2–3 acres in size,
depending on the types of associated tanks and
facilities. There is no doubt that well pad construction, which is ubiquitous across the uplands,
destroyed a number of historic and prehistoric
archeological sites, as survey and shovel testing
around the margins of a number of them did document the remnants of sites that had occupied the
removed landforms. Such industrial disturbances
have impacted portions of at least 19 sites within
the project area: 41RK672, 41RK673, 41RK675,
41RK680, 41RK683, 41RK693, 41RK701,
41RK703, 41RK704, 41RK708, 41RK709,
41RK710, 41RK712, 41RK713, 41RK717,
41RK718, 41RK720, 41RK727, and 41RK736.
Sand and Gravel Mining
There are three areas totaling 51 acres
that have been significantly compromised by
sand and gravel mining. All three are adjacent
to the valley wall in the north and north-central
portions of the project area. These operations
completely removed the surface sediments down
to the sandstone bedrock, producing cuts several
meters deep and spoil piles several meters high
(Figure 3.5). Where the removal of sand was the
desired goal, spoil piles consist of almost pure
hematite gravels mechanically sieved from the
sand. Lithic debitage was occasionally observed
on the surface and in the matrix of some of these
piles, indicating that some areas did harbor
prehistoric sites. It is probable that some of the
removed gravel material was used in oil and
gas well pad construction and as base fill for
well pad access roads throughout the project
area. Following sand and gravel extraction,
some of the areas have been used as sites for
construction material and road debris discard.
In at least one case, the sand pit adjacent to a
site expanded on a preexisting stock tank at the
base of the landform occupied by the site. The
two sites most impacted by sand and gravel
mining are 41RK672 and 41RK674.

DISTURBANCE TYPES
A number of different sources of ground
disturbance were documented during the survey.
Some are particular to certain areas, while
others are common across the project area. This
section elaborates on these and their distributions and overall impacts.
Oil and Gas Production
Oil- and gas-related disturbances consist
of well pads, pipelines and associated pumping
facilities, and access roads (Figure 3.4). There are
at least three major pipelines totaling 12.5 km
in length in the western half of the project area.
Each traverses the project area northwest-southeast, crossing the Cherokee Bayou floodplain,
valley wall, and uplands. There also are many
shorter pipelines of several hundred meters
each running to and from various well pads and
related facilities. The width of the disturbance
corridor for each of these is on the order of 30 m.
Construction of oil and gas well pads entailed
mechanically clearing the pad site, followed by
cutting or filling to create a level surface, depending on the terrain and drainage requirements. In
some cases, cutting was substantial and resulted
in removal of much of the landform to a depth
of 2–3 m or more. Well pads typically have one

Ranching and Agriculture
Agriculture- and ranching-related landscape disturbance has occurred on a regular
basis since the mid–late nineteenth century,
with ranching occurring as part of the twentieth-century shift from cotton and food crop
agriculture to livestock and hay production.

Within the project area, now there is little crop
agriculture practiced with the exception of individual household family gardens. Virtually all
open lands are used for grazing livestock and
growing hay for commercial sale. For the most
part, these activities have had minor impacts
on archeological sites. This is especially true
for ranching-related activities, which generally
have low-intensity impacts only to the upper
10–15 cm of sediments, although siting of
houses, barns, and other structures can have
deeper localized impacts. Disturbance from
farming probably was more substantial, since it
involved widespread clearing of vegetation followed by years of plowing. Compared to well pad
construction, though, these impacts were small.

of sawn stumps, skidder roads, dense stands
of secondary-growth vegetation (e.g., yaupon
and holly), and decaying piles of debris were
observed at numerous places across the project area (Figure 3.6). Much of this evidence is
older than the last 8–10 years, but some large
segments of the Cherokee Bayou floodplain
were in the process of being selectively thinned
for certain types of trees, primarily larger bald
cypress and oak, while the survey was ongoing. In general, these activities disturbed only
about the upper 20 cm of deposits because trees
were cut off aboveground with the stumps left
in place. Logging skidders and other vehicles
typically limited their greatest impacts to the
cleared logging roads and paths into the timber
sites. Five sites within the floodplain had been
subjected to these kinds of disturbances within
the few years prior to fieldwork for this project:
41RK680, 41RK681, 41RK685, 41RK703, and
41RK704.

RESULTS OF THE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY

4

The archeological survey resulted in the
discovery and documentation of 66 previously
unrecorded sites (Figure 4.1). Of the total, 33
are prehistoric Native American sites, 22 are
historic sites, and 11 are both prehistoric and
historic. There are 44 prehistoric components
and 33 historic components. Thirty-seven of
the prehistoric components are lithic scatters,
and 7 have both lithic and ceramic artifacts.
Thirty of the historic components are farmsteads or probable farmsteads, 1 is a barn, 1 is
a roadway, and 1 is a cemetery. Most historic
components appear to date to the early to mid
twentieth century, but 9 have some evidence
of nineteenth-century occupation. A total of 50
artifacts were recorded as isolated finds but not
collected; these items are detailed following the
site descriptions.

vegetation clearing, the site was significantly
impacted by construction of the well pad and
associated erosion control features, road construction, and the installation of pipelines. Site
areas along the interfluve shoulder are degraded
by cattle trails that focus surface slopewash into
small entrenched headcutting drainages.
Twenty-three shovel tests were used to
define a site area that is 130 m north-south by
210 m east-west. The site area does not include
the existing well pad or the adjacent pine-covered
slopes. Prehistoric artifacts were recovered in 10
shovel tests (Table 4.1). The assemblage consists
of medial and distal fragments of 2 bifaces and 13
pieces of chipped stone debris. This results in an
artifact density of 1.5 per positive shovel test. A
fire-cracked rock recovered in one of the positive
tests may be culturally derived. The distal biface
fragment is composed of red chert, probably local
in origin; the medial section is gray quartzite, also
probably local. The debitage consists of 8 whole
flakes, 3 flake fragments, and 2 pieces of heat
shatter; 2 are nonlocal gray chert, 3 are hematite,
2 each are Ogallala chert and Ogallala quartzite,
and 6 are probably local gray, brown, tan, and red
cherts. All pieces of debitage are small, typically
less than 1 cm in maximum dimension, probably
reflecting tool repair or late-stage finishing of
implements.
Vertically, 40 percent of the collected materials were at 0–40 cm below the surface, and
60 percent were at 40–80 cm. Nothing was recovered at 80–100 cm. Nine pieces of debitage were
collected at 40–80 cm, with six at 40–60 cm and
three at 60–80 cm. Three pieces were recovered
in the top 20 cm, and one was found at 20–40 cm.
The distal biface fragment was recovered at
0–20 cm, the medial fragment was collected

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
Site 41RK672
Description
Site 41RK672 is a diffuse prehistoric lithic
scatter on an interfluve summit and shoulder
along the valley wall south of the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain, about 350 m southwest of where
Watt Creek drains north into the bayou channel
(Figure 4.2). Surface elevations vary from about
275 to 325 ft above mean sea level. The site is
situated within maintained pasture surrounding
a gas well pad on the interfluve summit. A stand
of pines and hardwoods with open to moderately open understory is on the sloped interfluve
margin beyond the north and west ends of the
site. In addition to disturbance derived from

40–60 cm below the surface.
Area soils are mapped as Tenaha loamy fine
sand with 5–15 percent slopes and Darco loamy
fine sand with 1–8 percent slopes (Griffith 2000).
Surface sediments at 41RK672 can be characterized as fine loose loamy sands. Almost two-thirds
of the shovel tests (15 of 23) exposed surface
sediments more than 100 cm thick. In the 4 tests
that reached the argillic horizon, depths to clay
ranged from 15 to 95 cm and averaged 55 cm.

wide segment of the Cherokee Bayou floodplain. The topographic position suggests the
locality served as a base for hunting or plant
resource procurement on the floodplain below.
The scarceness of artifacts, upland setting,
and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts
and dateable organic materials, coupled with
the widespread disturbance, indicate that
isolating components and dating them would
be problematic, if not impossible. With these
limitations, 41RK672 is judged not to contain
important information about Native American
use of the project area and is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places. No further archeological
investigation is recommended.

20 to 100 cm below the surface. The artifacts
consist of two flakes and two flake fragments;
two are tan chert, and one each is petrified wood
and brown chert.
Sediments exposed in the tests are consistent with the occasionally flooded Owentown
fine sandy loam mapped in this locality (Griffith
2000). The tests revealed sandy to silty sandy
loam that is at least a meter deep (excavation
of Shovel Test JM9 was cut short due to rain).
None of these tests reached an argillic horizon.

Description
Site 41RK673 is a very sparse prehistoric lithic scatter on an elongated rise in the
Cherokee Bayou floodplain that may be a relict
levee deposit (Figure 4.3). Oriented northeast-southwest, this 520-m-long feature stands
approximately 1 m above the surrounding backswamp deposits south of the main channel. The
site is at an approximate elevation of 250 ft on
the southeast edge of the rise, roughly 250 m
south of Cherokee Bayou and about 120 m
northwest of an unnamed tributary that trends
along the south edge of the bayou floodplain. The
site is at the southwest end of a cleared pasture.
Surrounding vegetation consists of deciduous
forest scattered with occasional pine trees. A gas
well pad and its access roads border the northern
and western edges of the site area.
Eleven shovel tests were used to define a
75x35-m site area. Four tests yielded one flake
each for an artifact density of 1.0 per positive
shovel test (see Table 4.1). This small assemblage of four artifacts was evenly dispersed from

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK673 is a sparse lithic scatter on
the edge of a possible relict levee in the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain. The physical setting and
meager assemblage suggest only brief utilization
of this locality, perhaps to exploit seasonally
available resources. Given the nature of the
archeological remains, the lack of temporally
diagnostic artifacts, and the lack of dateable
organic materials, it is highly unlikely that
discrete cultural components could be isolated
and dated. Therefore, 41RK673 has no potential
to provide important information concerning

drainage flowing northeast from the valley
wall. Another small drainage is about 220 m
west-northwest of the site. Both flow into an
unnamed tributary that joins Cherokee Bayou
about 550 m north of the site. The drainage
that passes closest to the site is dammed in two
places, with a large stock tank immediately
south of the site. The site is in the corner of a
maintained pasture that covers much of the interfluve summit. Vegetation bordering the south
and east sides of the pasture is dense secondary
growth of deciduous hardwoods, yaupons, and
other forest vegetation. A small sand-mining
operation removed portions of the north edge
of the interfluve. The proximity of the sand pit
and an adjacent spoil pile suggest that this

operation may have damaged or removed parts
of a once-larger site area. Examination of the
cut face of the sand pit revealed no additional
cultural material, however.
The site area is defined by 37 total shovel
tests, of which 10 were positive for Native
American cultural materials (see Table 4.1).
The density of artifacts per positive shovel test
is 2.0. Recovered artifacts consist of 18 ceramic
sherds, 1 distal flake fragment, and 1 complete
flake. One of the positive tests also contained
several possible fire-cracked rocks that were
not collected. No indications of a cultural feature were observed in this test. A fragment of
burned clay, which may or may not be culturally derived, was found in Shovel Test DB034.
Based on the distribution of the positive tests,

41RK674 is 250 m northeast-southwest by
120 m northwest-southeast.
Lithic materials represented in the debitage
are one gray chert and one petrified wood. Of the
ceramic sherds, seven are plain, two are incised,
one is appliquéd and brushed, three are brushed,
two are punctated, and three are too small to
identify (Figure 4.5). All of the sherds are small,
characteristic of ceramics recovered from plowed
agricultural fields. The brushed sherds suggest
that some of the assemblage dates to the Middle
or Late Caddo period, although Early Caddo
occupation is possible as well.
All of the ceramics were found in the north
half of the site on what appears to be the highest
remaining portion of this landform. Vertically, ceramics were most frequent at 20–60 cm (14 of 18

interfluve summit above the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain. The various disturbances appear
to have had only a minimal impact on the site
deposits. The adjacent sand pit mine on the
west edge of the site undoubtedly impacted the
landform, but it is uncertain to what extent, if
any, the site was affected. It is one of only two
sites in the project area where Caddo ceramics
substantially outnumber lithics. Although
midden deposits were not identified and the
overall artifact density is low, 41RK674 appears
to represent Caddo occupations that were
associated with the nearby mound centers at
the Hudnall-Pirtle, Lane Mitchell, or Pine Tree
Mound sites. Sites such as this would have
functioned within settlement systems consisting
of a number of site types, including multifamily
villages, smaller residential hamlets, campsites,
and resource procurement and processing
areas. If interpretable components can be
isolated, 41RK674 would contribute to a better
understanding of those settlement systems. Site
41RK674 is considered potentially eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places
under Criterion D, pending test excavations to
more fully gauge its age, content, and integrity.

1 sherd recovered at 60–80 cm. The two flakes
were at 20–40 cm. The fragment of burned clay
was recovered at 40–60 cm, and the fire-cracked
rock was at 60–80 cm. Sixty-five percent of the
collected or observed materials were at 0–40 cm,
and 33 percent were at 40–60 cm.
Area soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine
sand with 2–5 percent slopes (Griffith 2000),
and surface sediments can be characterized as
loose silty sand. The depth of the B or Bt horizon
for this soil series is typically in excess of 1 m.
Overall, the surface sands at this site are of
moderate thickness, with 10 of the shovel tests
identifying sands more than 100 cm thick. In the
15 tests that reached clay subsoil, depths to clay
ranged from 30 to 100 cm and averaged 64 cm.
A horizons are dark brown to dark grayish
brown, and E horizons are brown, pale brown,

Description
Site 41RK675 is diffuse lithic scatter along
the summit of a north-trending interfluve on
the south valley wall of the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain (Figure 4.6). The landform is bordered by a cut in the valley wall on the east and
by a narrow deeply incised tributary valley on
the west that drains northward onto the floodplain just below the site. The interfluve surface
is at elevations of 300 to 312 ft. An unnamed
tributary and Cherokee Bayou are approximately 350 m and 900 m north-northwest of
the site, respectively. Vegetation in and around
the site area consists of a mixed overstory of
pines, sweetgums, oaks, and other hardwoods
with an understory of greenbriers, yaupons,
and shrubby vegetation. Pipeline installation
to the north and east and construction of a
gas well pad and associated access road to the
immediate south and east probably disturbed
portions of the site. A two-track road in the
north half of the site may be related to hunting
and camping in the area.

All of the prehistoric materials were recovered at 60–90 cm below the surface. The depth at
which this material was recovered is likely the
result of bioturbative and pedogenic processes
since the site is on a nonaggrading landform.
The whiteware sherd was found on the surface
at Shovel Test JD054, and its location next to the
two-track road suggests that it may be derived
from modern use of that locality.
Soils within the site area are mapped as
Bowie very fine sandy loam with 1–4 percent
slopes (Griffith 2000), and sediments exposed
in the shovel tests are consistent with this
classification. Those tests that were not impeded by tree roots or saturated sediments (7
of 11) revealed sandy loams and loamy sands
over 100 cm thick. None of the excavated tests
reached an argillic horizon.

Eleven shovel tests were used to define a
40-m north-south by 65-m east-west site area
that is delineated in part by surface topography
and the locations of gas pipeline and well pad
disturbances. Four tests were positive for Native
American artifacts, providing an artifact density
of 1.5 per positive shovel test (see Table 4.1).
Two tests contained one flake each, while a third
test yielded two flakes and a fire-cracked rock. A
fragment of a probable hematite axe or similar
implement was collected from a fourth test. The
debitage consists of one medial flake fragment
and two complete flakes. Lithic materials are
hematite, nonlocal gray chert, white chert, and
petrified wood. A single historic whiteware sherd
came from one of the tests; it is considered to
be an isolated find rather than an indicator of a
historic component.
89

been subjected to selective timber thinning, and
the use of skid haulers altered some parts of the
site surface. Other disturbances include surface
erosion, animal turbation, tree root growth, and
tree falls. The south edge of the site was recently
impacted by vegetation clearing for installation
of a new fence line. Tree removal and vegetation
clearing along portions of the drainage that
borders the east side of the site are associated
with adjacent well pad construction.
Surface survey and shovel testing identified
a probable filled well in the southeast portion
of the site area and a scatter of artifacts that,
when coupled with ornamental vegetation, are
suggestive of a residence. The remaining portion
of the well is lined with mortared ferrous sandstone. The neck of the feature either collapsed
or was razed. Hand- and machine-made bricks
visible in the uppermost part of the feature fill
may have been used in the top courses of the
original construction. Alternately, this material
could be derived from the dismantling of another
structure. The depth of the feature is not known.
Twenty-two shovel tests were used to define
a 90-m north-south by 70-m east-west site area
that is also delineated in part by surface topography and the locations of trees believed to
be associated with the historic occupation. Ten
tests were positive for historic artifacts, and 2
of those tests also contained one flake each (see
Table 4.1). Fragments of burned clay or sandstone
recovered in a tenth test may or may not be of
cultural derivation. Recovered historic materials
include clear, translucent green, translucent
yellow, and brown container glass; window glass;
milk glass; whiteware and stoneware sherds;
machine-made and unidentified brick and mortar
fragments; sanitary tin cans; wire nails; a metal
loop; unidentifiable metal fragments; plastic; foil;
a lead nail cap; a fence staple; pieces of garden
hose; and pieces of asphalt shingles. A pig bone
in Shovel Test JM038 is likely derived from the
historic occupation. Historic materials observed
on the surface but not collected include a metal
can, an aspirin-style brown glass bottle, and a
long metal machinery/farming implement fragment. Some of the artifacts, including the wire
nails, sanitary cans, plastic, foil, garden hose,
and asphalt shingles, date to the twentieth century (Busch 1981:97–98; Preservapaedia 2010;
Spude 2014; Wells 1998:87). No artifacts clearly
date to the nineteenth century, although the
hand-made bricks likely predate the late 1800s

Site 41RK675 is a sparse lithic scatter on an
interfluve summit at the point where a deeply
incised intermittent drainage flows onto the
Cherokee Bayou floodplain. The site location
at the lower end of the narrow incised valley
would have provided easy access to the broad
floodplain below. The assemblage is suggestive
of short-term, perhaps seasonal, utilization as
a campsite for hunting or the procurement of
plant resources. The scarceness of artifacts,
upland setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts and dateable organic materials
indicate that isolating components and dating
them would be problematic, if not impossible.
With these limitations, 41RK675 is judged
not to contain important information about
Native American use of the project area and is
considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. No further archeological investigation is recommended.
Site 41RK676
Description
Site 41RK676 is a multicomponent historic-age residence and diffuse prehistoric lithic
scatter situated at the end of a short pointed
interfluve at elevations of 310–330 ft (Figure
4.7). Although the topographic setting of the
historic component is not particularly conducive
to farming, higher flatter upland surfaces to the
south probably would have been suitable for
agricultural activities. The historic component
is centered on the wider, higher portion of the
interfluve, while the prehistoric component
is apparently confined to the lower northern
portion. The interfluve is defined by a steeply
incised tributary valley on the west and a lesser
drainage on the east, which converge just north
of the site area. The north-flowing intermittent
tributary passes about 40 m west of the site area
and empties onto the Cherokee Bayou floodplain
about 600 m to its north. Area vegetation consists of pines and hardwoods with open to dense
understory composed of secondary growth. Oaks
and sweetgums are the dominant hardwood
tree species. Trees associated with the historic
occupation include cedar, crepe myrtle, and two
large oaks. Ornamental flowers are present in
the southeast part of the site area. The area has
90

expansion of mechanized brick manufacture in
Texas (Steinbomer 1982:53–54). The remainder
of the assemblage could date to either century
and thus is not diagnostic. The majority of the
historic assemblage was found in the southeast
corner of the site area. The tests with prehistoric cultural materials (DB005 and JM042) were
downslope toward the north end of the interfluve;

these consist of a translucent tan chert flake and
a tan red chert distal flake fragment.
Twenty-seven historic artifacts were recovered from Shovel Test JM037, which was excavated as a single level to 45 cm within the well
depression, where excavation was impeded by a
large sandstone rock. Two salt-glazed ceramic
sherds were recovered along with other artifacts,

Mann’s Virginia-born mother, Matilda
Mann, survived him and continued to run the
farm until 1907 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records). She lived there with four of her
granddaughters working as farm laborers in
1900 and typically had a few equine, cattle, and
hogs (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records;
U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1900a). She was probably deceased by about
1908, when her son’s estate was assessed for
taxes on the property. The three Mann boys
each owned livestock during the decade but
held no land (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records).
The Mann heirs partitioned the 212 acres in
a series of legal transactions. In 1911, the Mann’s
youngest son, Earnest, received the 35-acre parcel
on which 41RK676 is situated, known as Block
No. 5 (Rusk County, Deed Record 109:632). He
was farming and lived with his older brother
Willis Mann, who owned adjacent land (containing 41RK682) along the Henderson and Harmony
Hill Road in 1900 and 1910 (U.S. Department of
Commerce and Labor, Bureau of the Census 1910;
U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1900a). The property was consistently appraised
at $200 annually during the 1910s and 1920s
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). In 1930,
at least one building was present, and much of the
property was in cultivation (Tobin International
1930). Mann was not living on the property in
1930 but in a house he owned on the Easton and
Kilgore Road in Gregg County, where he worked
as a grocery store salesman (U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1930a). That
year, he sold the 35 acres on which 41RK676 is
situated to brother Willis Mann for $700 in 1930
(Rusk County, Deed Record 153:87). Earnest
Mann continued to be assessed for taxes on the
property in the early 1930s, as was his estate for
the two years after his 1935 death (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records).
For a history of land ownership between
1930 and 1941, see 41RK682. In 1941, Willis
Mann sold the western 12 acres of Block No. 5,
on which 41RK676 is situated, to his eldest
brother George W. Mann Jr. for $10 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 355:6). The property had
two buildings in the location of 41RK676 in 1939
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1939).
Mann Jr. and his second wife, Ella, also owned
Block No. 4, the 35-acre parcel immediately

including whiteware and yellowware ceramic
sherds, a brown glass snuff bottle fragment, flat
rusted metal, machine-made brick fragments,
pieces of gray mortar, asphalt roof shingle fragments, and a piece of local ferruginous sandstone.
The 57 historic artifacts, other than those
from Shovel Test JM037, were found between the
surface and 60 cm. Of these, 31 were recovered
at 0–20 cm, 19 at 20–40 cm, and 7 at 40–60 cm.
The 2 pieces of prehistoric lithic debitage were
recovered from disparate depths, one at 0–20 cm
and one at 60–80 cm. The prehistoric artifact
density is only 0.2 per positive shovel test,
whereas the density for historic artifacts is 8.9
per positive shovel test.
Soils within the site area are mapped as
Kirvin fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent
slopes (Griffith 2000), and sediments exposed
in the tests outside the well depression are consistent with this classification. Those tests not
impeded by tree roots or saturated sediments
revealed surface sediments composed of loose
sands or fine sandy loams that ranged from 45
to more than 110 cm thick. Four tests reached
the Bt horizon at depths that ranged from 45 to
100 cm below the surface.
Site History
Site 41RK676 (Resource 6) is on Tract
R026-005, which encompasses 35 acres out of
the northwest quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre
Thomas O’Bar Survey (Figure 4.8). The site is
near the southwest corner of the tract, west of
an unnamed road that intersects State Highway
149 to the south.
J. W. Mays and W. W. Griffin owned a 212acre parcel out of the O’Bar Survey by 1884,
when they sold it to African American George W.
Mann Sr. for $500 (Rusk County, Deed Record
32:349). Mann had married Mary Waldon, and
the two Georgia natives had six surviving children before she died in 1885. Two sons, George W.
Jr. and Willis, were born in Georgia. The Manns
lived in Texas by 1882, where Minnie, Dora,
Earnest, and Roxie were born (Ball 1980). The
property increased slightly in value and by 1891
was appraised at $650 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records). Between 1884 and his 1892 death,
Mann generally owned a few equine, bovine, and
swine, and up to 20 goats; a wagon; and miscellaneous property worth between $5 and $15 (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).

1960; one building remained in the location of
41RK676 in 1960, and the land was no longer
under cultivation, but probably used as pasture
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1960;
U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the

Site 41RK677
Description
Site 41RK677 is a small diffuse lithic scatter
on the top edge of the east valley wall of a deeply
incised intermittent tributary (Figure 4.9). It is
one of four lithic scatters identified along a 900-m
stretch of the narrow stream, with 41RK675
approximately 240 m to the north-northeast and
41RK676 and 41RK678 about 120 m and 360 m to
the south-southwest. Site 41RK677 is at the end of
a broad gently sloping interfluve that is bordered
by steeper slopes on the west and northwest.
Surface elevations in the site area range from approximately 315 to 335 ft. The west edge of the site
is approximately 12 m above the floor of the adjacent drainage and about 40 m east of the tributary
center line. The interfluve surface was thinned of
timber and replanted in pines several years before
the survey, but hardwoods remained on the west
edge of the landform summit and on adjacent
sideslopes. A thin to moderate secondary-growth
understory is present in the pine replant area.
Aside from disturbance associated with timber
thinning and pine replanting, the east half of the
site area was disturbed by the construction of a
gas well access road that cut deeply into the top
of the landform. The site surface west of the road
is now subject to increased surface erosion from
drainage off the roadway. Natural disturbances to
the site area include animal turbation, tree root
growth, and tree falls.
Thirteen shovel tests were used to define
a site area that is 80 m northwest-southeast by
60 m southwest-northeast. Three shovel tests
contained three pieces of lithic debitage, three
contained pieces of possible fire-cracked rock,
and one yielded a small piece of burned clay that
may or may not be cultural (see Table 4.1). The
artifact density is 1.2 items per positive test.
The flakes consist of a proximal flake fragment
of Ogallala chert and single proximal and distal
flake fragments of probable nonlocal gray chert.
One flake was recovered at 60–80 cm below the
surface; the others were collected between 80
and 100 cm. Three fire-cracked rocks were at
60–80 cm, and one piece of rock and the burned
clay fragment were at 80–100 cm. The depths of
these materials may point to colluvial deposition

Summary and Assessment
The historic component at 41RK676 represents the remains of a residence on land that
was part of a farmstead associated with former
slaves George W. and Mary Waldon Mann beginning in 1884. Subsequently, their sons, Earnest,
Willis, and George Jr., sequentially owned the
land in the twentieth century. George Mann Sr.
and then his mother, Matilda, could have occupied
the property between 1894 and 1907, and Earnest
Mann could have lived there from about 1911
until 1930; Earnest’s brothers and their families
used the land and buildings in the following
decades. The archeological remains observed
could relate to any or all of these chiefly twentieth-century occupations. The historic component
is considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places because it dates mostly
to the twentieth century, probably was occupied
until at least 1960, and has limited features
that could provide information on site layout, all
of which indicate that it is a poor candidate for
contributing important archeological information
about the history of the area. No further archeological investigation is recommended.
The prehistoric component at 41RK676 is
a very sparse lithic scatter on the summit of
an upland interfluve. The assemblage is suggestive of very short-term use. The scarceness
of artifacts, upland setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts and dateable organic
materials indicate that isolating components
and dating them would be problematic, if not
impossible. With these limitations, 41RK676
is judged not to contain important information
about Native American use of the project area
and is considered ineligible for listing in the

of surface sediments from higher elevations to
the southeast. Alternatively, bioturbation and
pedogenic processes may have moved these
materials downward within an otherwise stable
sediment column.
Area soils are mapped as Bowie very fine
sandy loam with 1 to 4 percent slopes (Griffith
2000), which is consistent with sediments exposed in the shovel tests and along the cut bank
on the east side of the road. Surface sediments

are deep in this locality. All of the tests but one
revealed silty sands and sands over 100 cm thick
(excavation of Shovel Test JD062 was impeded
by a tree root). None of the tests reached an
argillic horizon.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK677 is a small sparse lithic scatter on a broad interfluve along the east edge
95

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
Site 41RK678

of a narrow tributary valley. The assemblage
suggests short-term, perhaps seasonal, use of
this locality. Site 41RK677 may have served as
a short-lived campsite for procurement of food
resources. The scarceness of artifacts, upland
setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts and dateable organic materials indicate
that isolating components and dating them
would be problematic, if not impossible. With
these limitations, 41RK677 is judged not to
contain important information about Native
American use of the project area and is considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. No further archeological investigation is recommended.

Description
Site 41RK678 is a scant lithic scatter on
the summit and shoulder of a wide interfluve
near the head of an upland drainage (Figure
4.10). Situated approximately 800 m south
of the Cherokee Bayou valley wall, it is the
southernmost of four lithic scatters recorded
along the north-flowing intermittent tributary
that drains onto the bayou floodplain (see
41RK675–41RK677). The site is on a forest
margin at the east edge of a gas pipeline and
overhead utility line corridor. Woodland vegeta-

at the north edge of a maintained pasture at
an elevation of 320 ft (Figure 4.11). The south
half is in the pasture, and the north half is in a
vegetation belt left along a property fence line,
between the pasture and an east-west gas well
access road that marks the northern limit of the
site area. Vegetation along the fence line consists
of hackberry, oak, and sweetgum trees with
a light to moderate understory. The head of a
low-order upland drainage is about 60 m northwest of the site. The small channel at the bottom
of this cut drains onto the Watt Creek/Cherokee
Bayou floodplain only during the wettest times
of the year. A well just south of the access road,
approximately 70 m west of the site, likely
represents the closest dependable water source
for the historic-age occupation at 41RK679. In
addition to the usual natural disturbances such
as animal burrowing and tree throws, the site
has been impacted by vegetation clearing and
structure removal, construction of the gas well
access road, and fence installation. Several push
piles are present in the area between the access
road and the parcel fence line. Erosion is evident
along the south edge of the road, and the slightly
lower area to its immediate south serves as a
catchment for surface flow. Tested sediments in
this area were boggy after recent heavy rains.
Historic maps and aerial photographs indicate one or two buildings in this location in
1930 and 1939 and a complex of buildings by
1958 and the 1960s. The multiple structures are
likely a residence and associated outbuildings.
No structural features were observed within
the recorded site area, but a concrete-lined well
and a machine-made brick barbecue pit found
on opposite sides of the access road about 70 m
west of the site might be associated with the
historic component.
Eight shovel tests were used to define a site
area that is 25 m northwest-southeast by 40 m
southwest-northeast. Five tests were positive
for historic artifacts, with single prehistoric
artifacts in two of these tests (see Table 4.1).
The recovered historic assemblage consists of
23 pieces of clear, aqua, green, and brown container glass; 2 pieces of window glass; a cast
metal toy truck part and 21 unidentified metal
items; a rubber shoe heel; and a piece of plastic.
Degraded pieces of flat metal were observed in
one test but not collected. The plastic item and
shoe heel certainly are twentieth century (Spude
2014; Timeline of Shoes 2014), but the remain-

tion has been cleared from the west half of the
site, and the area is now vegetated with pasture
grasses, forbs, and a stand of secondary-growth
trees. The east half of the site is on the edge of
the pine and hardwood forest found along the
adjacent drainage. Site surface elevations vary
from 330 to 335 ft.
Ten shovel tests were used to establish a
site area that is 15 m north-south by 25 m eastwest. Two of the tests contained one flake each at
60–80 cm (see Table 4.1). One is a small hematite
flake, and the other is a proximal flake fragment
of gray mottled chert. The artifact density is only
1.0 per positive shovel test. Small fragments of
burned clay were identified in one of the positive
tests and in another test, but this material was
not collected since its derivation is equivocal.
Surface sediments in the site area are
mapped as Darco loamy fine sand with 1 to
8 percent slopes (Griffith 2000), and sediments
exposed in the shovel tests are consistent with
that classification. Thick surface sands were
revealed in all of the tests. A tree root at 90 cm
blocked the excavation of one test, but the others
were dug to depths of 100–115 cm without exposing B horizon sediments.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK678 is a sparse lithic scatter on a
broad interfluve at the headward portion of an
intermittent upland drainage. The assemblage
is suggestive of a brief visit to this locality, possibly for targeted resource procurement. The
scarceness of artifacts, upland setting, and lack
of temporally diagnostic artifacts and dateable
organic materials indicate that isolating components and dating them would be problematic, if
not impossible. With these limitations, 41RK678
is judged not to contain important information
about Native American use of the project area
and is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.

der of the assemblage could date to either the
nineteenth or twentieth century and thus is not
diagnostic. The prehistoric assemblage consists
of a Bonham arrow point of yellowish tan chert
(Figure 4.12) and an Ogallala quartzite medial
flake fragment. Densities of artifacts per positive test are 9.8 for historic artifacts and 1.0 for
prehistoric artifacts.
Ninety percent of the historic assemblage
(44 of 49 artifacts) was recovered at 0–60 cm
below the surface, and nearly half of that group
(n = 21) was found at 20–40 cm. Eleven historic artifacts are from 0–20 cm, 12 are from
40–60 cm, and 5 are from 60–80 cm. The flake
was with historic artifacts between 40 and
60 cm. The Bonham arrow point is the only artifact recovered at 80–100 cm below the surface;
it suggests the prehistoric component dates to
the Early Caddo period.
Area soils are mapped as Darco loamy fine
sand (Griffith 2000). The shovel tests exposed

in the family until at least 1997 (Rusk County,
Appraisal District Records 2013).

Site 41RK679 is on Tract R026-036.02,
which encompasses 35 acres out of the northwest quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas O’Bar
Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is at the south
edge of the tract, just east of a short unnamed
road that intersects State Highway 149 to the
south. For a history of land ownership between
1884 and 1911, see 41RK676.
The Mann heirs partitioned the 212 acres
that their father, George W. Mann Sr., had
acquired in 1884 in a series of legal transactions. In 1911, the Mann’s oldest daughter,
Minnie, received the 35-acre parcel containing
41RK679, known as Block No. 2 (Rusk County,
Deed Record 73:343). She and her four-year-old
son, Harvey, had been living with her brother-in-law and sister, Robert and Roxie Mann
Mathis, who were renting a farm and had
three children at the time (U.S. Department
of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of the Census
1910). She likely moved to her land within a
few years. Her property was appraised at $150
in 1915, peaking in 1924 and 1925 at $300, but
it was usually valued at $200 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). She claimed the
property as her homestead for several years
in the early 1930s, although in 1930 she was
renting a house in Longview and working as
cook for a family (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records; U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census 1930b). In 1930 and 1939, the
property had improvements in the location of
41RK679, with one or two buildings and stands
of trees and cropland (Tobin International 1930;
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1939).
Mann lived in Longview permanently after
1934, and she was living in the home of her
son’s mother-in-law, along with him, his wife,
and their son, Willie Byron, by 1940 (U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the
Census 1940). Nevertheless, she was assessed
for taxes on the property as late as 1945 (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
By 1960, the property had several improvements in the location of 41RK679, and the land
may have been used for pasture but was not
in cultivation (U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service 1960). Eventually the land passed to
her grandson, Willie Byron Mann, and remained

Summary and Assessment
The historic component at 41RK679 is a
farmstead on land associated with former slaves
George W. and Mary Waldon Mann beginning
in 1884. Their oldest daughter, Minnie Mann,
and her heirs owned the land from 1911 until
1997, and she likely occupied it most of the
time from the 1910s until 1934. It is likely that
other members of the Mann family used the
land when she was not living there during that
period and subsequently. The archeological remains observed could relate to any or all of these
twentieth-century occupations. The historic
component is considered ineligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places because
it dates entirely to the twentieth century, was
occupied until at least 1960, and has no features
that could provide information on site layout,
all of which indicate that it is a poor candidate
for contributing important archeological information about the history of the area. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.
The prehistoric component at 41RK679 is a
very sparse lithic scatter on an upland summit.
The Bonham point indicates occupation during
the Early Caddo period, but artifacts are so
sparse it is hard to say much about the prehistoric component, other than that it must reflect
ephemeral, short-term use. The scarceness of
artifacts, upland setting, and lack of dateable
organic materials indicate that isolating components and dating them would be problematic,
if not impossible. With these limitations, the
prehistoric component is judged not to contain
important information about Native American
use of the project area and is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places. No further archeological investigation is
recommended.

site probably represents multiple episodes of
short-term use as a special-purpose campsite,
perhaps for procurement and processing of
floodplain resources. Situated at an elevation
of 240 ft, the site is in terrain characterized by
undulating topography with low wet sloughs and
periodically inundated interconnecting short
drainages. Vegetation is typical of Cherokee
Bayou and Sabine River valley floodplain communities. Observed tree species include older
growth cypress along the channel and channel
levee along with sweetgums, some oaks, elms,
and infrequent loblolly pines. Understory plants
are primarily saplings, greenbriers, occasional
short grasses, yaupon thickets, and poison ivy.
Some parts of the site and surrounding floodplain have been cleared of trees and now are
used for production of hay and grazing cattle.
The northern edge of the site is defined by the
existing channel of Cherokee Bayou, and the
south, west, and east edges are in the floodplain and defined by shovel test results. The
topography of the southern and southeastern
parts of the site is characterized by shallow
flood chutes, wet-weather drainage channels,
and possibly dissected relict levee deposits that
remain as slightly higher parts of the floodplain
landscape. The site surface exhibits disturbance
from ATVs and logging machinery, and piles of
logging debris are scattered in and around the
eastern portion of the site area. Natural impacts observed include surface erosion, animal
burrowing, pig rooting and wallowing, tree root
growth, and tree throws.
A total of 79 shovel tests were excavated to
define a site measuring 155 m northwest-southeast by 405 m southwest-northeast. Of these, 24
shovel tests were positive for prehistoric cultural
material totaling 34 artifacts (see Table 4.1).
This provides an artifact density of 1.4 per positive test. The recovered assemblage consists of
28 pieces of lithic debitage, 1 biface, 2 fragments
of ground stone artifacts, and 1 small plain sherd
(Figure 4.14a). The sherd is not diagnostic, but
it is grog tempered and appears to be from a
Caddo vessel. The thick, early-stage biface is
of Ogallala chert with stream-worn cortex on
one side (Figure 4.14b) The ground stone tool
fragments are a possible polished hematite axe
fragment and a pitted ferruginous sandstone
fragment (Figure 4.14c–d). Two pieces of firecracked rock were observed but not collected.
A variety of lithic materials are represented

among the debitage: Ogallala chert (n = 14),
Ogallala quartzite (n = 3), petrified wood (n = 2),
and 1 piece each of quartzite, hematite, black
chert, tan gray chert, translucent mottled gray
chert, brown chert, translucent brown chert, and
nonlocal white chert. Of these, 93 percent are
local or probably local. The black chert flake may
be derived from either the Big Fork Formation
in southeastern Oklahoma or from gravel bars
along the Red River (Perttula 1984), and the
white chert piece could be from the Ozarks,
Ouachitas, or Edwards Plateau regions (Banks
1984, 1990). Virtually all pieces of debitage are
cortex free and small (about 1 cm on average)
and can be attributed to tool repair or late-stage
tool manufacture. There are 14 complete flakes,
2 proximal fragments, 1 medial fragment, 5
distal pieces, 3 pieces of shatter, 2 lateral flake
fragments, and 1 indeterminate flake fragment.
The vertical distribution of the 32 artifacts recovered is fairly even: 2 at 0–20 cm, 7
at 20–40 cm, 6 at 40–60 cm, 10 at 60–80 cm,
and 7 at 80–100 cm. Roughly 50 percent were
recovered between the surface and 60 cm and
50 percent between 60 and 100 cm. The sherd
and biface were recovered at 60–80 cm in
Shovel Test DB061 along with burned sandstone. The hematite axe fragment was found at
20–40 cm. The pitted stone fragment was found
at 60–80 cm.
Soils are mapped as Laneville loam and
Owentown fine sandy loam, both frequently
flooded (Griffith 2000), which corresponds well
to the deposits observed during shovel testing.
The site has moderately deep sands and silty
sands across much of its extent with 65 tests
reaching depths of 100 cm or more without
encountering an argillic horizon. Of the tests
that did not reach 100 cm, only 8 encountered
an argillic horizon or clay boundary with depth,
varying between 20 and 95 cm. Redoximorphic
features and gleying were encountered in 2 tests

excavations in Shovel Tests JD117 and JD122,
and saturated sediments were observed at 80 cm

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK680 is a large lithic and ceramic
scatter probably representing a series of campsites on high ground above the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain. The location within a frequently

flooded landscape suggests occupations were
of short duration and perhaps related to exploitation of the surrounding bottomlands. It
is one of five sites spread along the length of
the floodplain east-west that could have the capacity to yield useful information about Native
American use of the floodplain. No instances of
archeological remains within stratified Holocene
alluvium were observed in the shovel tests, but
it is possible that such contexts could be present,
particularly on the lower margins of some of the

landforms. If so, it may be comparatively easy
to isolate components in some areas. The single
sherd indicates that it has a Caddo component,
and thus it appears to have the potential to
contribute to a better understanding of Caddo
settlement systems, particularly that associated
with the Early Caddo ceremonial center at the
Hudnall-Pirtle site on the Sabine River not far
to the northeast. Site 41RK680 is considered
potentially eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places under Criterion D,

landform on the Cherokee Bayou floodplain, approximately 200 m south of the main tributary
channel (Figure 4.15). The relatively wide rise is
bounded by wet-weather drainage channels and
possible relict levee deposits dissected by flood
chutes on the north, south, and east. The west
edge of the landform is limited by a mechanically
altered channel that directs surface runoff along

the east edge of a gas well pad. Shallow flood
chutes and rills cross the surface of the rise.
Area vegetation consists of older-growth elm,
sweetgum, oak, and other deciduous tree species.
Occasional cypresses are present along some of
the larger alluvial features, and pine trees are
occasionally present in well-drained localities,
including the site area. Recent timber thinning
induced the emergence of a variable-density
understory dominated by greenbriers and poison
ivy. The site surface exhibits disturbance from
ATVs and logging machinery, and piles of logging
debris are scattered in and around the site area.
Natural impacts include surface erosion, animal
burrowing, pig rooting and wallowing, tree root
growth, and tree throws.
Eleven shovel tests were used to define a
25-m north-south by 15-m east-west site area that
is delineated on its north and east sides by surface
topography. Nine small flakes were recovered
from three tests that contained from one to six
flakes each (see Table 4.1). The resulting artifact
density is 3.0 per positive test. Four flakes were
recovered at 20–40 cm below the surface, one was
at 40–60 cm, and four were at 60–80 cm. Five are
Ogallala chert, two are hematite, and one each is
translucent gray chert and translucent red chert.
Six are complete small flakes, one is a proximal
flake fragment, and two are probable other flake
fragments, all related to late-stage tool manufacture or tool maintenance.
Sediments exposed in the tests are consistent with the frequently flooded Laneville loam
mapped in this locality (Griffith 2000). Most of
the tests revealed sandy loams and silty sandy
loams more than 100 cm thick. Tree roots impeded the excavation of Shovel Test VH043, and
Shovel Test JD238 was in a burned tree throw
depression.

Site 41RK682
Description
Site 41RK682 is a historic farmstead in an
eroded upland setting in a corner of a large hay
field and cattle pasture (Figure 4.16). Historic
aerial photographs indicate multiple buildings
in this location by 1939; these had been removed
by 1960. The site is at an elevation of 350 ft along
a fence separating the pasture from a tree line
dominated by loblolly pines and scattered hardwoods, primarily oaks with sweetgums along the
headcut drainages. Pasture vegetation consists
of short grass. The site area is level and little
disturbed by surface erosion. Much of the site
has been impacted by active animal burrowing.
Other disturbances include clearing of the structural remains and subsequent agricultural use.
A total of 18 shovel tests were excavated
to define a site area 60 m north-south by 60 m
east-west. Two flat, possibly dressed pieces of
native stone on the surface may have functioned
as structure footing stones. Two large cedar trees
and a hackberry tree along the south edge of the
site may partially define an exterior yard area,
whereas an eroded depression on the north side
of the site may mark a well, cistern, or privy. The
depression is irregular in shape with sloping
sides. No artifacts were observed on the surface
around the feature.
Twenty-five artifacts were recovered from
the nine positive shovel tests (see Table 4.1), for
an artifact density of 2.8 per positive test. The
assemblage consists of clear and brown container glass; a milk glass sherd; a plain whiteware
sherd; stoneware sherds; wire nails and unidentified nails; a metal nut; pieces of wire; pieces
of flat metal; and unidentified brick fragments.
Artifacts were distributed between the surface
and 40 cm with 11 artifacts at 0–20 cm and 14
at 20–40 cm. Five tests had 1 artifact each, and
four had between 3 and 8 artifacts. The tests
with higher artifact counts are characterized
by limited artifact variety consisting of multiple
small brick fragments, flat metal or corroded
wire nails, or fragments of the same glass container. Shovel Test JM111 yielded a piece of

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK681 is a small sparse lithic scatter on high ground above the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain. The physical setting and meager
assemblage suggest only brief utilization of this
locality, perhaps to exploit seasonally available
resources. Given the nature of the archeological
remains, the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, and the lack of dateable organic materials,
it is highly unlikely that discrete cultural components could be isolated and dated. Therefore,
41RK681 has no potential to provide important

possible Albany-slipped stoneware at 0–20 cm.
A small sherd of possible blue and white stoneware with remnants of an embossed design on
the exterior was found in Shovel Test JM119 at
20–40 cm. The wire nails indicate occupation
after the early 1890s (Wells 1998:87), while the
remainder of the assemblage could date to either
the nineteenth or twentieth century and thus is
not diagnostic.
Average shovel test depth to the argillic
horizon was 30 cm, varying between 10 and
45 cm. According to the soil survey, the Bt hori-

zon contact for Bowie fine sandy loam mapped
in this area typically is between 25 and 51 cm
below surface (Griffith 2000). The site sediments
compare favorably to this soil type.
Site History
Site 41RK682 is on Tract R026-0006, which
encompasses 35 acres out of the northwest
quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas O’Bar
Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is at the south
edge of the tract, east of an unnamed road that

to Longview by 1945 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records).
Between 1953 and 1959, the Mann heirs
sold their interests in Block No. 6 to F. G.
Cherry for a total of $180 (Rusk County, Deed
Records 517:362, 364, 584, 518:330, 666:47).
Cherry retained the land until 1992 (Rusk
County, Appraisal District Records 2013). The
property appears to have been abandoned by
1960, and neither he nor subsequent property
owners occupied the land (Rusk County, Deed
Records 840:94, 988:57, 64; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1960).

intersects State Highway 149 to the south and
west of County Road 2196D. For a history of
land ownership between 1884 and 1911, see
41RK676.
The Mann heirs partitioned the 212 acres
that their father, George W. Mann Sr., had
bought in 1884 in a series of legal transactions. In 1911, the Mann’s second-oldest son,
Willis, received the 35-acre parcel containing
41RK682, known as Block No. 6, for $1 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 77:257). Mann and his
wife, Georgia, were farming along the Henderson
and Harmony Hill Road in 1900 and 1910, and
his youngest brother, Earnest, lived with them
those years, probably at 41RK682. The Manns
had seven children by 1910 (U.S. Department
of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of the Census
1910; U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1900a). By 1912, Mann was operating an
additional 100 acres out of the O’Bar Survey, on
which 41RK702 is situated, which he purchased
in 1914 from G. H. Watson for $750. This land
may have served as their homestead at some
point (Rusk County, Deed Record 95:150). His
property was appraised at $350 in 1915 (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). By 1920, their
farm was part of a “negro” settlement, and the
road was no longer considered public, but the
property value peaked in 1923 and 1924 at
$900 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records;
U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the
Census 1920). In 1930, Mann had purchased
the 35-acre Block No. 5, on which 41RK676 is
situated, from his younger brother, Earnest
Mann, for $700 (Rusk County, Deed Record
153:87). That year, Willis and Georgia Mann
lived on their farm, probably at 41RK682, with
their children (U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of the Census 1930b). His property was
usually appraised at $800 until the mid 1930s,
after which it was generally valued at $500 or
$600 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
By 1939, the property retained improvements
at 41RK682, but the land was no longer under
cultivation and was probably used as pasture
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1939).
The couple resided there in 1940 with one adult
son (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of
the Census 1940).
In 1944, Mann sold the 35-acre Block No. 6
to six of his children for $100 (Rusk County,
Deed Record 381:318). The couple had moved

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK682 is a farmstead on land that
was associated with former slaves George W.
and Mary Waldon Mann beginning in 1884.
Their second-oldest son and his wife, Willis and
Georgia Mann, occupied the property from about
1911 until the early 1940s; the archeological
remains observed apparently relate to this occupation. It is unclear whether the property was
occupied subsequently, and it was abandoned
by 1960. It is considered ineligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places because
it dates entirely to the twentieth century, was
occupied until mid-century, and has no features
that could provide information on site layout,
all of which indicate that it is a poor candidate
for contributing important archeological information about the history of the area. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.
Site 41RK683
Description
Site 41RK683 is a sparse lithic scatter atop
the summit and shoulder of an upland interfluve
(Figure 4.17). The site lies at elevations of 320–
340 ft along the north edge of a narrow side drainage that opens onto a broader southwest-northeast
stream valley that eventually drains onto the
Cherokee Bayou floodplain. Surrounding vegetation consists of relatively open pasture with
scattered loblolly pine trees on the north side of a
fence line and a very dense secondary growth of
hardwoods, saplings, greenbriers, and scattered
yaupons south of the fence. Vegetation clearing
and installation of a gas pipeline and gas well

tanks impacted the northeast side of the site area.
Based on field observations, animal burrowing is
a significant disturbance factor.
Twenty-two shovel tests define the lithic
scatter over an area 115 m northwest-southeast
by 25 m southwest-northeast (see Table 4.1).
Three shovel tests were positive for prehistoric
cultural materials providing an artifact density
of only 1.0 item per positive test. These consist
of a small piece of red translucent chert shatter
found at 20–40 cm, a hematite flake found at

40–60 cm, and a small red chert Friley point
found at 20–40 cm. Three small pieces of burned
clay that may or may not be cultural were observed at 70–80 cm in Shovel Test DB114. A small
piece of nonhuman bone and a small petrified
wood flake were found on the surface in animal
burrow backdirt on the west edge of the site.
Site sediments are mapped as Lilbert loamy
fine sand (Griffith 2000). Shovel testing revealed
that the sediments are variable. Average shovel
test depth was 86 cm, but individual depths
varied between 65 and 105+ cm. Lilbert soils

not impossible. With these limitations, 41RK683
is judged not to contain important information
about Native American use of the project area
and is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.

Summary and Assessment

Site 41RK684

Site 41RK683 is a very sparse lithic
scatter on an upland interfluve overlooking
a wet-weather drainage on the west side of a
larger stream. The recovered assemblage suggests short-term use of this locality, and the site
may have served as a campsite for procurement
of food resources. The Friley arrow point indicates that at least one occupation was during the
Woodland or Early Caddo period. The scarceness
of artifacts, upland setting, and lack of dateable
organic materials indicate that isolating compo-

Description
The site is a historic farmstead at an elevation of 350 ft at the edge of a pasture on the
shoulder of a large upland interfluve (Figure
4.18). A 1938 highway map, 1939 and 1960 aerial
photographs, perhaps the 1930 aerial, and the
1958 USGS topographic map all indicate a single
structure in this location. The only existing surface indications of a site here are several large
oak and other trees and an open unlined well

between two of these trees. The site is about 20 m
north of County Road 2195 and roughly 330 m
east of State Highway 149. A utility transmission
line and gas pipeline corridor pass along the
southwest edge of the site. Since the site is in the
southwest portion of a large open pasture, the
primary vegetation is short grass and weeds. In
addition to the transmission line and gas pipeline
corridor, other disturbances include animal turbation, cattle grazing and trampling, and some
slope erosion to the east.
Twelve shovel tests were excavated to define
a site area of 35 m north-south by 45 m east-west
(see Table 4.1), with the artifact scatter not extending far beyond the stand of trees. A total of 31
artifacts was recovered at 0–40 cm in five shovel
tests, for an artifact density of 6.2 per positive
test. Shovel Test VH036 contained 11 artifacts at
0–20 cm; the remaining tests had between 2 and
5 artifacts each. The assemblage contains clear
and green container glass, window glass, lamp
chimney glass, plain whiteware sherds, wire nails,
a threaded metal bottle cap, several pieces of thin
copper sheeting, and unidentified metal pieces.
The wire nails indicate occupation after the early
1890s (Wells 1998:87), and threaded bottle cap
dates to the twentieth century (Lindsey 2014b);
the remainder of the assemblage could date to
either the nineteenth or twentieth century and
thus is not diagnostic.
The only cultural feature identified is the
well remnant mentioned above. Situated between
two adjacent trees, the upper edge of the well is
defined by flat local ironstone cobbles or small
boulders and is 1.5 m in diameter. Circular in
shape, this feature was excavated into the underlying clay. The well appears to be unlined.
Site soils are identified as Lilbert loamy fine
sand (Griffith 2000). The average depth of shovel
tests and the Bt horizon was 40 cm, with shovel
test depths varying between 20 and 65 cm. Most
tests encountered damp gravelly orange clayey
sand at the bottom. A typical sediment profile
documented in Shovel Test DB132 consists of an
8-cm-thick A horizon of dark brown loosely consolidated sandy loam over light brown silty sand
and gravels that extends to 35 cm. The latter was
underlain by wet pale orange gravelly sand that
changed to bright orange gravelly clayey sand at
55 to 65 cm. The 65 cm depth is comparable to the
general depth of the transition from the E horizon
to the Bt horizon in the typical pedon description
for Lilbert soils (Griffith 2000:143), so the majority

Site History
Site 41RK684 is on Tract R026-035, which
encompasses 100 acres out of the northwest
quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas O’Bar
Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is near the
south edge of the tract on the north side of
County Road 2195, which intersects State
Highway 149 to the west.
John William Hendrick purchased this 100acre tract in 1905 (Rusk County, Deed Record
57:597). He lived with his family on the property
that year and had 5 equine, 15 bovine, 10 swine,
and $25 in miscellaneous property (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1906, Hendrick sold the property to Albert
Olin Menefee (1865–1942) for $500 (Groves
2013a; Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records;
Rusk County, Deed Record 57:598). Menefee
was born in Alabama and living with his four
siblings, mother, and stepfather in Rusk County
by 1880 (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1880a). He and his first wife, native Texan
Effie Gladney Menefee (1867–1908), married
in 1891 and had five children who survived to
adulthood (Groves 2013b; Rusk County, Deed
Records 294:299–300; Rusk County Historical
Commission 1982:303; U.S. Department of the
Interior, Census Office 1880a). He had attended
medical school at Tulane University and practiced medicine in Tatum. Menefee was also the
first mayor of the small community (Rusk County
Historical Commission 1982:303). Menefee owned
land out of several surveys in Rusk County but
lived in Tatum (U.S. Department of Commerce
and Labor, Bureau of the Census 1910; U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
1920, 1930b, 1940; U.S. Department of the
Interior, Census Office 1900a). His rural holdings
were appraised at $12,525 in 1908 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). After his first wife’s
death in about 1908, he married Anna Vinson
(1877–1940) (Medlin 2009a; Rusk County, Deed
Record 448:244). That year, he owned several
parcels of land appraised at $8,810, 20 equine,
10 bovine, 10 swine, and 3 wagons or carriages,
and he had $3,715 in merchandise, other wares,
or miscellaneous personal property (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). In 1912, Menefee
acquired a 66-acre parcel out of the Freeman
109

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
Survey, on which 41RK718 is situated, and a
112-acre parcel out of the Simon Survey, on which
41RK734 is situated (Rusk County, Deed Records
73:1, 76:117). In 1924, Menefee acquired a 69-acre
parcel out of the O’Bar Survey, on which 41RK692
and 41RK700 are situated, and an adjacent 34acre parcel (Groves 2013a; Rusk County, Deed
Records 54:598, 125:61–62, 267:216). In 1940,
he gifted his land to his three surviving daughters, Minnie Belle Menefee Young, Grace Judson
Menefee Young, and Agnes Menefee. The land
remains part of the Albert Olin Menefee estate
(Rusk County, Appraisal District Records 2013;
Rusk County, Deed Record 340:533).
Tenants likely occupied the property during
part of the twentieth century. Much of the land
was in cultivation by 1930, and there were three
sizable stands of trees (Tobin International
1930). By 1939, the cropland was terraced, and
a single building, probably a house, was present
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1939).
By 1960, the cropland remained in cultivation,
and other improvements were still evident there
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1960).

hill on the Cherokee Bayou floodplain. The site,
at an elevation of 250–270 ft, is spread out
along the western steeper edge of the hilltop
and overlooks a portion of the main bayou channel (Figure 4.19). Here, the channel meanders
around to the north side of the hill before turning east. Below the south end of the hilltop are
at least three small wet-weather channels that
drain into the main bayou channel on the west
edge of the hill. The summit and slopes of the
hill are vegetated in a variety of deciduous trees
with an open to moderately dense understory
dominated by small saplings and greenbriers.
Selective thinning of older-growth timber has
disturbed portions of the site surface and left
skid-loader tracks, piles of vegetation debris,
stumps, and pushed-over vegetation. The central
and northern ends of the hilltop also have been
disturbed by the construction and installation
of a large gas well pad on the north end and an
access road along the eastern central part of
the summit. Smaller two-track roads cross the
south end of the hilltop and the southern part of
the site. A series of large push piles adjacent to
a cleared level area on the south end of the site
are probably related to access road and well pad
construction or for stationing equipment when
the well was being drilled.
Twenty-nine shovel tests were excavated to
define the site area that is 195 m north-south by
60 m east-west. Seven tests were positive for a
combined total of 12 lithic artifacts (see Table 4.1).
The artifact density is only 1.7 per positive test.
Artifacts consist of 1 worked hematite or ochre
fragment, 9 complete flakes, 1 proximal flake
fragment, and 1 piece of shatter. Debris size and
a lack of cortex indicate that tool maintenance or
later stages of tool manufacture is represented.
These activities may have been associated with
resource procurement and processing. Lithic
materials are 5 Ogallala chert, 1 other chert, 3
Ogallala quartzite, 2 petrified wood, and 1 hematite or ochre. All of these are of local origin. Half
of the artifacts came from 60–80 cm; single items
were found at 0–20 and 80–100 cm, and two items
each came from 20–40 and 40–60 cm.
Average shovel test depth was 77 cm, with
depths ranging between 40 and 100 cm. Shovel
tests revealed an upper zone of sandy loam or
silty sandy loam above clay loam or sandy clay
loam. Only 10 tests reached an argillic horizon,
and most of these are at the southern end of the
site in the vicinity of the push piles and cleared

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK684 is associated with ownership
of the land by Albert Olin Menefee and his heirs
beginning in 1906. The Menefees did not occupy
the tract, though, and it is likely that the archeological remains observed relate to occupation
by tenants, starting in the 1930s and continuing
until at least the 1960s. The site is considered
ineligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places because it dates entirely to
the twentieth century, was occupied till at least
mid-century, has limited features that could provide information on site layout, and was occupied
by tenants and thus is of unknown associations,
all of which indicate that it is a poor candidate
for contributing important archeological information about the history of the area. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.

brief utilization of this locality, perhaps to exploit seasonally available resources. Given the
nature of the archeological remains, the lack

no potential to provide important information
concerning area prehistory and is considered

thinned in recent years, and the understory is
relatively open. Loblolly pines and hardwoods
are characteristic. An ATV trail meanders along
the site’s east-west axis, and its southern edge
is defined by a parcel boundary fence, negative
shovel tests south of that fence, and increased
slope. In addition to selective timber thinning,
the site has experienced some slope erosion, primarily to the west and northwest, some animal
burrowing, and tree-throw damage.
Eight shovel tests were excavated to define
a small site that is 15 m north-south by 45 m
east-west. Only three tests were positive, yielding four complete flakes, one proximal flake fragment, and one medial flake fragment (see Table
4.1). The resulting artifact density is 2.0 per
positive test. Lithic materials represented are

ineligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places. No further archeological investigation is recommended.
Site 41RK686
Description
Site 41RK686 is a very small and localized lithic scatter situated at an elevation of
260–270 ft on a fairly level bench on the slope of
an interfluve ridge summit on the east side of a
long narrow steam draining northward onto the
Cherokee Bayou floodplain (Figure 4.20). Steeper
slopes are on the west edge toward a small drainage, and the site surface rises gently to the south
and east. Vegetation and trees were selectively

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
A total of 15 shovel tests were excavated to
define a site area of 45 m northwest-southeast
by 145 m southwest-northeast. Two shovel tests
yielded five prehistoric artifacts, and two pieces
of lithic debitage were collected from animal
burrow backdirt at the south end of the site (see
Table 4.1). Artifact density is 2.5 per positive
test. The assemblage consists of one complete
flake, two lateral flake fragments, two proximal
flake fragments, and two pieces of burned sandstone; also recovered was a piece of burned clay
that may or may not be cultural. The artifacts
in the shovel tests were at 40–60 cm.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert fine sandy loam.
Shovel tests revealed an argillic horizon at an
average depth of 68 cm, encountered at depths
ranging from 25 to 100 cm. Four shovel tests did
not reach the argillic horizon. The tests revealed
deposits comprised largely of damp to wet,
loosely consolidated silty sands with abundant
ironstone gravels.

three Ogallala chert, one hematite, one petrified
wood, and one Ogallala quartzite. Two artifacts
were recovered at 0–20 cm, one at 20–40 cm, and
three at 40–60 cm.
Soils on the site are mapped as Woodtell
loam (Griffith 2000). These soils are characteristic of convex side slopes on upland interfluve
ridges. Average shovel test depth was 65 cm,
with a range between 48 and 100 cm. An argillic
horizon was encountered in seven tests between
depths of 48 and 70 cm.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK686 is a small isolated lithic
scatter in an eroded upland setting adjacent to
a small stream that drains onto the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain. The recovered assemblage
suggests short-term use of this locality. The
scarceness of artifacts, upland setting, and lack
of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable
organic materials indicate that isolating components and dating them would be problematic, if
not impossible. With these limitations, 41RK686
is judged not to contain important information
about Native American use of the project area
and is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK687 is a small sparse lithic scatter on an eroded upland landform adjacent to
a small unnamed stream that drains onto the
Cherokee Bayou floodplain. The site probably
functioned as a short-term campsite or resource
procurement location, although the paucity of
artifacts prevents interpretation. The scarceness
of artifacts, upland setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable organic
materials indicate that isolating components
and dating them would be problematic, if not
impossible. With these limitations, 41RK687
is judged not to contain important information
about Native American use of the project area
and is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.

Site 41RK687
Description
Site 41RK687 is a diffuse lithic scatter
along ca. 200 m of a narrow southwest-northeast interfluve ridge top at an elevation of
300 ft (Figure 4.21). The east and west sides
of the ridge are fairly steep, but the north nose
is less so, presenting a gradual descent to the
narrow drainage on the east. The summit of the
landform was cleared of timber within the last
decade, and piles of timber debris are present
around the edges of the clearing. The west side
of the site is on the highest part of the ridge, and
surfaces slope downward gradually to the east.
Vegetation consists of short to medium grasses
and short shrubs and scattered deciduous trees
and loblolly pines. The clearing is bordered by
woods with a dense understory. Disturbances
include vegetation clearing, active animal burrowing, and some slope erosion on the east side
of the site.

Site 41RK688
Description
Site 41RK688 is a historic farmstead on the
south summit edge of an upland interfluve at an
elevation of 320–330 ft. The east-oriented interfluve is on the west side of a small north-draining
unnamed stream that empties onto the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain (Figure 4.22). The interfluve
summit slopes down gently to the east before drop113

ping more steeply into the narrow stream valley.
Much of the summit consists of open pasture with
scattered hardwoods. Interfluve slopes are covered
by deciduous hardwoods and scattered loblolly
pines. Logging debris piles in the vicinity suggest

the area was cleared in the last 10 years. Other
disturbances include active animal burrowing,
erosion, and surface or trash burning. Historic
aerial photographs show a single building here in
1939 and perhaps earlier that decade.

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
either a recent trash pit or a well filled with
burned debris. The upper 40 cm of fill in that
test were disturbed. Artifacts were recovered at
40–120 cm, and modern sheathed electrical wire
was exposed throughout the test. The majority of
material recovered was either burned or melted,
and surrounding sediments were blackened and
ashy. Historic artifacts were collected at 0–40 cm
in four other positive tests. In addition, 1 piece
of solarized container glass was collected from
the east end site surface. Most artifacts were
recovered on the relatively level east end of the
landform, which would be a logical place for a
house to have been. Aerial photographs dating to
1930 and 1939 show structures at or very near
this location. The recovery of a single flake of
Ogallala chert in Shovel Test JM138 suggests
a very limited prehistoric use of the landform.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000), consistent with what the shovel
tests exposed. Shovel tests revealed that the
upper 35 to 105+ cm are loosely consolidated
brown to grayish-brown silty sand. The average
depth of the argillic horizon in the nine tests that
reached it is 62 cm.

Twelve shovel tests were excavated, 5 of
which were positive for historic artifacts; a
sixth test contained a single lithic flake that is
considered to be an isolated find rather than an
indicator of a prehistoric component. These tests
defined an elongated artifact scatter that is 20 m
north-south by 80 m east-west. The recovered
historic assemblage of consists of 32 artifacts,
including solarized, brown, and clear container
glass; window glass; lamp chimney glass; plain
whiteware sherds; a wire nail; metal can pieces;
a U-bolt; barbed wire pieces; unidentified flat
metal; an asbestos tile; and an aluminum pull
tab (see Table 4.1). The wire nail indicates occupation after the early 1890s (Wells 1998:87),
and the asbestos tile and aluminum pull tab
date to the twentieth century (Spude 2014). The
solarized glass probably dates to 1880–1920
(Lindsey 2014a), while the remainder of the
assemblage could date to either the nineteenth
or twentieth century and thus is not diagnostic.
The shovel test assemblage provides an artifact
density of 6.2 per positive test. Most of the artifacts (n = 22) were obtained from Shovel Test
DB195, which was in what appears to have been

Site History

By 1933, Williams was deceased and his
daughters—Mamie, Clyde Ellen, Jimmie Lee,
and Margaret—sold the eastern 50 acres of the
land to Israel S. White for $150 (Rusk County,
Deed Record 371:308). Nevertheless, the
Williams estate was assessed for taxes on the
property as late as 1945. It is unclear whether
the property was occupied, but much of the land
remained in cultivation in 1939 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records; U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939).
In 1952, White sold the land, considered to
be 52 acres at the time, to Silas Martin and H. L.
Martin for $1,200 (Rusk County, Deed Record
480:363). By 1960, much of the improved land
was used as pasture, with a small portion in cultivation, but the farmstead was no longer extant
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1960).
In 1972, the widow of Silas Martin and
H. L. and Lynn Martin sold the land to Troy R.
McClelland (Rusk County, Deed Records
946:172, 175, 1048:769). McClelland conveyed
the land to Patsy McClelland in 1996 (Rusk
County, Appraisal District Records 2013).

Site 41RK688 is on Tract R026-013, which
encompasses 52 acres out of the northeast quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas O’Bar Survey
(see Figure 4.8). The site is just west of the center
of the tract.
The land was part of a 100-acre parcel that
William Clark Buford and his wife, Susan Hall
Buford, owned by 1909. They were married in
1880 and resided in Henderson that year. He was
a lawyer, became district court judge, and gradually acquired several parcels of land in Rusk
County (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records;
U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor,
Bureau of the Census 1910; U.S. Department
of Interior, Census Office 1880a, 1900a). The
100 acres was appraised at $300 in 1909, just a
small portion of his $5,775 in Rusk County real
estate (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
After his 1916 death, Buford’s children, all
adults by that time, held interests in their
father’s landholdings in Rusk, Harrison, and
Gregg Counties, including land out of the O’Bar
Survey. They sold this land to their mother, his
widow, Susan C. Hall Buford, that year for $10
(Rusk County, Deed Record 96:554). She resided
in Henderson in 1920 with four of her children
and her father (U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of the Census 1920).
In 1925, Buford sold the 100-acre parcel to
James F. Williams, an African American farmer,
for $1,400 (Rusk County, Deed Record 105:3).
Williams had earlier acquired nearby lands—a
25-acre parcel out of the O’Bar Survey on which
41RK701 is situated from Miles Norris in 1912,
and an adjoining 25-acre parcel from Mrs. Mary
Wilhelm, Mrs. Ronda Wilhelm, and Mrs. Bennie
Hendrick in 1918 for a total of $700 (Rusk County,
Deed Records 65:608, 98:256). Williams and his
wife, Lucinda, had eight children and lived on
their farm, probably at 41RK701, by 1920 (U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
1920). From 1925 until 1932, his 150 acres were
appraised at $1,000 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records). His first wife was deceased by 1930,
when Williams lived on the farm with his second
wife, seven of his children, and three of his stepchildren (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census 1930b). Improvements consisting
of possible structures, cropland, and pastureland
were in and near the location of 41RK688 by 1930
(Tobin International 1930).

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK688 is a farmstead on land associated with James F. Williams between 1925 and
1933 and his heirs from 1933 to 1952. Since the
Williamses probably lived at 41RK701 on land
he had purchased earlier, the archeological remains at 41RK688 likely to relate to occupation
by tenants. The site is considered ineligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places
because it dates entirely to the twentieth century, probably was occupied till near mid-century,
has limited features that could provide information on site layout, and was occupied by tenants
and thus is of unknown associations, all of which
indicate that it is a poor candidate for contributing important archeological information about
the history of the area. No further archeological
investigation is recommended.

a broad upland interfluve about 100 m west of
a narrow north-flowing stream that drains into
Cherokee Bayou (Figure 4.23). The steep east
edge of the interfluve is bounded by a short
wet-weather drainage on the west side of the
stream. Vegetation consists of deciduous trees
and scattered loblolly pines with dense understory along the east slope of the interfluve. Parts
of the interfluve summit have been cleared of
trees and are now in short ryegrass. A nearby
deer stand and a PVC pipe deer feeder indicate
the area is used for hunting. Disturbances include vegetation clearing, some erosion along the

east edge and slope of the interfluve, and active
animal burrowing. An ATV track also crosses the
site in a north to south direction.
Eight shovel tests were excavated across the
small interfluve summit, and only two were positive for prehistoric cultural material (see Table
4.1). A piece of petrified wood shatter was found
at 20–40 cm, and a brown chert flake was recovered at 20–40 cm. Artifact density per positive
shovel test is only 1.0. Site size based on shovel
testing is 65 m north-south by 25 m east-west.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000). The average shovel test depth
117

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
was 77 cm, and the average depth of the argillic
horizon was 74 cm. Shovel test depths ranged
between 40 and 100 cm. Shovel Test DB199
is typical of the site deposits and revealed a
25-cm-thick loosely consolidated, very fine grayish-brown sand with a few small gravels over a
zone of light yellowish-brown fine-grained sand
with a few ironstone gravels to a depth of 85 cm.
The latter was underlain by reddish-brown

include agricultural activities (hay cultivation
and cattle grazing), slope and hilltop erosion, and
active animal burrowing. The east-central part of
the site area north of the historic component has
underground irrigation lines and surface connections, but there is no readily visible evidence of
terracing or contour plowing.
A total of 128 shovel tests were used to
define a site area that is 455 m north-south
by 295 m east-west. Thirty-nine of those tests
yielded historic or prehistoric artifacts. The
historic farmstead component, which is roughly 75 m west of County Road 2194, includes
the foundation of a burned and razed house, a
clapboard structure that was moved onto the
site, a partially burned small wooden shed, a
corrugated tin and wood barn and fence enclosure, a privy, a concrete-lined well with electric
pump, a partial road bed remnant leading west
from the county road, and a partially trash-filled
gully (Figures 4.25 and 4.26). At the far north
end of this area are four abandoned automobiles
dating from the 1980s to early 1990s. The historic component is ca. 139 m north-south by ca.
120 m east-west. This area was defined with 41
shovel tests. Eleven of these contained historic
artifacts, and 12 had prehistoric artifacts. The
historic materials were only in the top 20 cm and
consist of whiteware fragments, a fence staple,
container glass sherds (clear, brown, green, and
cobalt blue), window glass, an aluminum pull
tab, a segment of aluminum tubing, corroded
wire nails and fragments, other corroded metal
fragments, flower pot fragments, and a fragment
of clay sewer pipe. Many of these items, including
the aluminum pull tab, aluminum tubing, wire
nails, flower pot fragments, and clay sewer pipe,
undoubtedly relate to the most recent occupation
of the site prior to its abandonment (Spude 2014;
Wells 1998:87). The remainder of the assemblage
could date to either the nineteenth or twentieth
century and thus is not diagnostic. The artifact
density is 5.5 per positive test (see Table 4.1).
The footprint of the burned main original
residence is in roughly the center of the cluster of existing buildings. A partially collapsed
house is about 15 m due north of the burned
structure. According to the present leaseholder
(Willie Norris, personal communication March
29, 2012), the collapsed house was moved to the
property within the last decade or so. According
to Norris, the original residence was a brick and
wood single-story structure. The existing foot-

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK689 is a small sparse lithic scatter
on an eroded upland summit adjacent to a small
stream that drains onto the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain. It likely represents very short-term
use of the location. The scarceness of artifacts,
upland setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable organic materials
indicate that isolating components and dating
them would be problematic, if not impossible.
With these limitations, 41RK689 is judged
not to contain important information about
Native American use of the project area and is
considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. No further archeological investigation is recommended.
Site 41RK690
Description
Site 41RK690 is a diffuse prehistoric lithic
and ceramic scatter overprinted with the remains
of a historic farmstead. Prehistoric artifacts are
distributed irregularly about the periphery of the
large interfluve but are clustered in the vicinity
of the historic farmstead in the southeast part
of the site. Aerial imagery from 1930, 1939, and
1960 show multiple structures at this location.
Some of the historic structures have burned,
and one was razed. Aside from a barn, which
is still in use, the remaining structures are in
various stages of decay and collapse. The site
is on an eroded upland interfluve with much of
the site area and surrounding land consisting
of open land used for cattle grazing and hay
pasture (Figure 4.24). Scattered small stands
of loblolly pines are present in some areas, and
the woods surrounding the open pasture are a
mix of deciduous hardwoods and pines with open
to moderately dense understory. Disturbances

Slightly southeast of the shed lies the concrete-lined water well or cistern with attached
electric pump and motor in remnants of a
rectangular machine-made brick and concrete
housing. The well or cistern opening is capped by
a 2-inch-thick concrete disk of the same diameter
resting atop the concrete casing. The pump and
housing are connected to the well by two galvanized pipes. The bricks used in the structure that
surrounds the well pump and electrical motor
are similar to those used around the razed house.
Shovel Test VH113 revealed a subsurface
octagonal industrial ceramic sewer pipe running northeast-southwest from the razed house
to a trash-filled gully or ravine parallel to an
east-west fence line about 15 m south of this
structure. The shallow gully is filled with midto late-twentieth-century material like red and
white metal enamel cookware, a coffee pot, screw
top club sauce bottles, canning jars/fragments,
soda bottles, and other clear glass commercial
goods containers with screw-top closures.
The barn and surrounding fenced enclosure
are about 60 m southwest of the above-described
building complex. The barn has 6-inch-diameter
wood pole vertical supports, a 2x6-inch wood
frame, and corrugated metal roofing and siding.
The surrounding fencing consists of mixed
materials including spare commercial lumber,
barbed wire, chain-link fencing, spring-loaded
cattle chute gates, and commercial metal ranching gates. In addition, a two-track pasture road
approaches southeast to northwest from the
county road.
Immediately north of the historic component are three locations where subsurface
pipes meet one or more valves that appear to
be related to an irrigation system. Brass manufacturer plates and embossed lettering on the
valves indicate they were made by Cameron
Iron Works (superimposed CIW and Cameron).
Cameron Iron Works was incorporated in
Houston in 1920. The firm concentrated on
service and manufacture of oilfield equipment
until World War II. It manufactured army
ordnance, particularly depth-charge projectors and arbors for the Navy, along with gun
barrels, gun mounts, and rockets. The British
Oilfield Equipment Company of London and
Leeds purchased Cameron Iron Works in 1954
(Kleiner 2013). These pipes and valves appear
to be related to 1950s-era irrigation equipment
no longer in service.

print and foundation/pier remnants suggest the
house was a front-gable style structure. At least
two different styles of machine-made bricks
are evident, one with three holes and exterior
vertical grooves and another consisting of solid
red rectangular bricks. The house footprint is
ca. 15 m east-west and 12 m north-south and
consists of a poured concrete front porch with
precast front and back steps, two short concrete
and machine-made brick pillars on the front
of the house, and a machine-made brick chimney base on the middle exterior of the north
wall. The fireplace was supplied by a gas pipe.
Burned beams run east and west. Mr. Norris
noted that this structure had rounded eaves
and was a landmark property in the Flanagan
community until it burned in a grass fire. A
large magnolia tree is at the south edge of the
foundation, and a concrete walkway extends
into a yard area on the east side or front of the
house footprint.
A large limb that fell from a tree growing
between the two houses crushed the roof and
much of the southern and eastern portions
of the clapboard structure. It has no chimney
and is set on precast concrete piers. The roof is
covered with asphalt shingles, and the exterior
walls are covered with clapboard siding. Precast
concrete steps are present at the entrance on
the front (east) façade. Structure dimensions
are roughly 12 by 12 m. The previously noted
abandoned vehicles are about 20 m due north
of this collapsed structure.
A privy about 20 m west of both houses is
a simple structure of milled lumber (with dimensions of 1x4, 1x6, and 2x4 inches) and wire
nails, a single door, and a handmade molded
concrete toilet with wood seat cover. The roof
is corrugated metal. Its dimensions are ca.
1.5 m north-south and 1 m east-west. A small
machine-made brick and concrete structure of
unknown function is just northwest of the privy.
It was made of some type of heat-resistant bricks
and concrete with an industrial brick footing
and might have served as the base to an exterior
barbecue pit.
An adjacent small storage shed is between
the northwest corner of the house and the outhouse. Built with materials like those used in
the privy, the shed’s corrugated tin roof stands
at a height of slightly over 2 m. The roof and
south and east sides of this structure are partially burned.

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
Site History

In addition to shovel testing done in the
vicinity of the historic component, 87 tests were
excavated to define the extent of prehistoric
deposits. Of these, 18 were positive for prehistoric cultural material. For the entire site, the
prehistoric artifact density was 2.3 per positive
test. A total of 42 prehistoric artifacts were recovered. The assemblage consists of 24 complete
flakes, 6 proximal flake fragments, 1 medial flake
fragment, 2 distal flake fragments, 2 bipolar
flakes, 5 pieces of shatter, 1 biface or proximal
dart point fragment, and 1 plain sherd. Lithic
materials are primarily local in origin with only
2 pieces that may be nonlocal (1 black chert and
1 white chert). Local materials include Ogallala
chert and quartzite, petrified wood, hematite,
reddish-brown chert, brownish-yellow chert,
brown chert, yellow chert, brown quartzite, gray
quartzite, and other quartzites. The sherd is an
undecorated clay-paste specimen consistent with
Caddo wares; otherwise, it is not diagnostic.
Prehistoric artifacts were distributed between the surface and 100 cm: 13 at 0–20 cm,
11 at 20–40 cm, 11 at 40–60 cm, 3 at 60–80 cm,
and 1 at 80–100 cm. Two artifacts were collected
from the surface of an animal burrow backdirt.
The distribution shows a strong presence of
prehistoric artifacts between 0 and 60 cm, consisting of 85 percent of the assemblage. Much
of the material is broadly scattered across the
sloping east and west edges of the site, and it is
possible that some artifacts have been moved
downslope by erosion.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000). The average shovel test depth
was 72 cm with the depth range between 12
and 105 cm. The argillic horizon was reached
in 75 tests at an average depth of 52 cm. Of the
shovel tests that encountered the argillic horizon, the depth range varied from 12 to 80 cm.
Testing indicates that surface sand thickness
is variable, especially moving upslope and from
southeast to northwest. This probably is largely
due to increasing surface slopes and the eroded
and rolling surface topography of the upper part
of the large interfluve. Most of the shovel tests
revealed an upper zone of loosely consolidated
to semiconsolidated silty sand with occasional
to very common local ironstone gravels. Carbon
flecking was widely dispersed throughout the
column in some shovel tests, probably the result
of land clearing to create agricultural fields or
pastures.

Site 41RK690 (Resources 38A–H) straddles Tracts R026-016 and R026-017, which
encompass approximately 100 acres out of the
northeast quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas
O’Bar Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is west
of County Road 2194.
South Carolina native Thomas O’Bar
had immigrated to the Republic of Mexico in
1822. The State of Coahuila and Texas granted him title to 4,428 acres in Rusk County on
October 13, 1835 (Texas General Land Office
1835a). O’Bar was taxed on the land in 1849,
when it was appraised at $2,214 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records).
From the 1840s until at least 1870, Virginia
native James Madison (1810–1880) and Margaret
M. Gladney (1817–1882) Langhorne and their
family likely occupied a house out of this portion of the O’Bar Survey along the stage road
between Camden and Henderson (Findley 1998;
U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1860a, 1870; Wiseman 2002). The house had
a foundation of huge rocks, its walls were logs
pinned together with stout wood pegs, and windows had six panes of glass (Findley 1998). This
house may have been at 41RK690, but if so, its
location remains undiscovered.
By the early 1870s, James Winwright
Flanagan had purchased the O’Bar Survey in
its entirety for $3,728.66 (Rusk County, Deed
Records W:604, V:317). Flanagan held many
properties in Rusk County and did not occupy
this land (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1882, the O’Bar Survey was sold through
a sheriff’s deed to high bidders John Phelps and
his sons Ashton and William A. for $1,050 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 31:31). Phelps was a prominent and wealthy cotton factor in New Orleans
and president of the cotton exchange there. He
died in 1886 (The Monroe Bulletin 1886).
In April 1890, William A. Phelps and Ashton
Phelps sold a 276-acre parcel out of the O’Bar
Survey to Walter C. Robinson (1851–1909) for
$200 (Rusk County, Deed Record 38:387; Stroud
1919:149; U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1900a). Robinson had married
Eunice Cleopatra Stroud (1851–1918), and
they lived in Alabama in 1880 with their young
children (Anonymous 2009a; Stroud 1919:149;
U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1880b). By 1891, they lived in Rusk County and
123

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
held another 200-acre parcel out of the O’Bar
Survey, and it is unclear which parcel served
as their homestead. In sum, their property and
improvements were appraised at $715 that year,
and he owned 4 wagons, 25 swine, miscellaneous
property worth $480, and $1,000 in materials or
manufactured items (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records).
In 1893, Robinson sold the 200-acre parcel
and another 100-acre parcel out of the O’Bar
Survey to Richard B. Levy and E. F. Young for
$1,010 (Rusk County, Deed Record 42:84). It is not
apparent that either Levy or Young lived on the
property (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1896, Levy and Young sold a 99.84acre parcel out of the O’Bar Survey to African
American Lazarus, also known as Tazann and
Lab, Cato for a total of $1,000 (Rusk County,
Deed Records 46:36, 155:437). Cato lived on his
farm with wife Emilie, whom James Winwright
Flanagan had held as a slave, and two of
their children, Samuel and Geneva (Findley
1998; U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1900a). They generally had two equine,
three bovine, five swine, a wagon, and a small
amount of cash, and the property was typically
appraised at $200. By 1901, Cato was deceased,
and in subsequent years his widow or son, Sam,
occupied the land, which was valued at $300
in the latter half of the decade (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). In 1910, Emilie Cato
lived with a son-in-law and daughter, Wesley L.
and Mary L. Cato Garrett, on a farm along the
Longview and Harmony Hill Road with their
eight children and an aunt, and son Sam Cato
also lived on this road with his wife and their two
young children (U.S. Department of Commerce
and Labor, Bureau of the Census 1910). She was
annually assessed for taxes on the land by 1909,
which appreciated over time, and was appraised
at $700 in 1920 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records). That year, Emilie Cato occupied the
farm with granddaughter Tessie B. Shaw and
grandson Erastus Shaw (U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1920).
In 1924, Cato retained a life estate in her
land but divided it among three heirs, giving
33.33 acres to daughter Mary L. Cato Garrett,
33.33 acres to grandson Samuel Cato, and
33.33 acres to granddaughter Tessie B. Shaw
(Rusk County, Deed Records 124:532, 533, 534).
In 1926, Emilie Cato gifted 44.49 acres to granddaughter Tessie B. Shaw, 44.49 acres to Samuel

Cato, and 11.19 acres adjoining to the north
to Mary L. Cato Garrett (Rusk County, Deed
Records 129:331, 332, 333). Cato continued to
reside on the land with her son and daughterin-law, Samuel and Luverter Cato, and seven of
their children (U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of the Census 1930b). The property
retained its value throughout the 1920s and
1930s (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1930, structures, cropland, and stands of
trees were in the location of 41RK690 (Tobin
International 1930).
In 1938, Mary L. Cato Garrett and her husband conveyed the south 33.33 acres to Tessie B.
Shaw Smith, and Smith and her husband conveyed the north 33.33 acres to Garrett (Rusk
County, Deed Records 323:386–387). A spat the
following year involved the southern parcel, from
which the Garretts ejected the Smiths, despite
having conveyed the land to them (Rusk County,
District Court Minutes 13492:A, 14462:A). One
account states that Emilie Cato still resided in
the Langhorne house, which retained only one
original 20-ft-square log room with a 12-ft-high
ceiling, in 1938 (Findley 1998). The property
had improvements and cropland in the location of 41RK690 in 1939 (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939). In 1940, Cato resided
with her son-in-law and daughter, the Garretts,
along the Old Henderson and Tatum Road (U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
1940). They began claiming a 33.33-acre parcel
out of the O’Bar Survey as their homestead beginning in 1937, and the property was appraised
at $100 annually through at least 1940 (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). Improvements
remained extant in the location of 41RK690
at least as late as 1960 (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1960). The land remains in
the Cato family (Rusk County, Appraisal District
Records 2013). A current tenant of the land noted
that the property has been known as a local
landmark for many years, and that the collapsed
house was moved to its present location.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK690 is on land associated with
Lazarus and Emilie Cato from 1896 until his
death in about 1901. His widow continued to own
the property and work the land, probably with the
124

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
help of her adult children, after his death until
at least 1935. Her heirs subsequently owned the
land, and it was occupied until after 1960. The
historic archeological remains observed appear
to relate mostly, if not entirely, to occupation
by heirs during and after the mid twentieth
century, but it is possible that the site contains
earlier undiscovered remains. The historic component is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places, in spite of
the potential presence of remains relating to nineteenth-century occupation, because it has abundant remains relating to use into to the latter
half of the twentieth century, making it extremely
unlikely that a nineteenth-century component
could be isolated for interpretation. No further
archeological investigation is warranted.
The prehistoric component at 41RK690 is
a large sparse lithic and ceramic scatter on an
upland summit. It likely represents short-term
use of the location, with the single sherd sug-

gesting some of this use was during the Caddo
period. The scarceness of artifacts, upland setting, and scarceness of temporally diagnostic
artifacts and dateable organic materials indicate
that isolating components and dating them
would be problematic, if not impossible. With
these limitations, the prehistoric component
at 41RK690 is judged not to contain important information about Native American use
of the project area and is considered ineligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places. No further archeological investigation
is recommended.

edge of a well-maintained hay pasture adjacent
to mixed hardwoods and loblolly pines with a
moderately dense to open understory. Elevation
varies between 320 and 360 ft. The site is about
600 m east of a small stream that has an associated small wetland area and wider floodplain.
The north and west edges of the site are defined by a shallow drainage that connects with
the adjacent stream, while the south and east
boundaries are defined by shovel test results,
a gas pipeline, and the edge of the interfluve.
Disturbances include active animal burrowing,
land clearing, and pipeline installation. The gas
pipeline parallels the south edge of the site from
southeast to northwest.
A total of 25 shovel tests were excavated
to define a site area that is 70 m north-south
by 200 m east-west. Five tests were positive
for prehistoric cultural material, with a sixth
test containing a single historic sherd that is
considered to be an isolated find rather than
an indicator of a historic component (see Table
4.1). The recovered prehistoric assemblage
consists of six artifacts: one complete flake,
two medial flake fragments, two pieces of
shatter, and one proximal flake fragment. The
prehistoric artifact density is 1.2 per positive
test. Two artifacts are petrified wood, one is
burned chert, one is hematite, and one each
is Ogallala chert and Ogallala quartzite. The
recovered artifacts are distributed relatively
evenly in the site deposits, with two artifacts
each at 20–40 and 40–60 cm, one at 60–80 cm,
and two at 80–100 cm. The single historic sherd
is possibly related to 41RK692, which is 80 m
southwest in the same hay pasture.
Soils are mapped as Darco loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000). The typical profile for this soil
series has a fairly thick sand or sandy loam.
The average shovel test depth was 90 cm. Only
7 tests encountered an argillic horizon at depths
varying between 60 and 80 cm. Eighteen shovel
tests were excavated to 100 cm or more and did
not encounter an argillic horizon, indicating that
the overlying sands are generally thick.

Site 41RK692
Description
Site 41RK692 is a multicomponent site with
a probable historic farmstead and a diffuse prehistoric lithic scatter. It is distributed along the
tree line at the southwest corner of a hay pasture
about 80 m southwest of 41RK691 (Figure 4.28).
Surface elevations vary from 315 to 330 ft. No
indication of structures is visible on any of the
historic maps or aerial images, and no evidence
of footings, piers, a well or cistern depression, or
structural debris was encountered during survey
and shovel testing. The tree line along the west
edge of the site is dominated by a dense stand of
deciduous hardwoods including oaks, elms, and
sweetgums with scattered pines. The understory
varies from relatively open to moderately dense
downslope to the west. As with 41RK691, disturbances are related to vegetation clearing to
create the open field, active animal burrowing,
and limited erosion on the west edge of the site.
Thirty-one shovel tests were used to define
a site area of 55 m northwest-southeast by
140 m southwest-northeast. Seventeen tests
were positive for a mixed assemblage of historic
artifacts and occasional pieces of prehistoric
lithic debitage. The recovered artifacts consist
of 10 pieces of prehistoric chipped stone debris
and 52 historic glass, metal, and ceramic artifacts (see Table 4.1). The prehistoric assemblage is composed of 7 complete flakes, 1 distal
flake fragment, and 2 pieces of shatter. Lithic
materials represented are 5 Ogallala chert, 2
brown chert, 2 other probable local cherts, and
1 nonlocal white chert. Other than reflecting use
of mainly locally available lithic materials, the
artifacts are not very informative about prehistoric behaviors or chronology.
Most of the historic artifacts are not diagnostic, but some suggest a nineteenth-century or
maybe early-twentieth-century age for the assem-

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK691 is a broad sparse scatter
of lithic debris on upland interfluve. It likely
represents very short-term use of the location.

blage. These include an Albany-slipped stoneware
sherd, a whiteware sherd with a Charles Meakin
mark, five pieces of solarized glass, a flow blue
transferware sherd, a green transferware cup or
bowl sherd, an olive green container glass fragment, and a single cut nail (Figure 4.29).
The Albany-slipped stoneware sherd, from
Shovel Test VH168 (20–40 cm) has a general age
of production from the late nineteenth century
until about 1940 (Stelle 2001; Zimler 1987:35).
Level 1 of this test yielded a single fragment of
dark olive green bottle glass. Although the type of
bottle or container could not be identified, a rough
age estimate based on color suggests the glass
container was produced between the late 1800s
and early 1910s (McKearin and Wilson 1978).
A whiteware base sherd from a plate or bowl
found on the backdirt of Shovel Test VH152 has
a small portion of the maker’s mark visible, with
the style and wording comparable to a mark used
in the 1880s by Charles Meakin of the Eastwood

Pottery at Hanley, England (Godden 1991:426).
The single flow blue transferware sherd, obtained
from Shovel Test DB273 (20–40 cm), appears
to be a bowl or cup rim sherd with an interior
geometric-filled triangular-grid design. This ceramic style was produced from 1825 to the early
1900s (Williams 1995). A transferware bowl or
cup sherd with a green floral or rose design was
found in Shovel Test JM208 (0–20 cm). The color
suggests mid-nineteenth-century production
(Stelle 2001). The design is made up of numerous minute dots resembling stippling that may
be derived from a design transfer method called
the “bat process” in which transfer was accomplished by using oil and a sheet of glue known
as a “bat” (Gurujal 1988). Solarized glass has a
general manufacture range between 1885 and
1920 (Munsey 1970; Toulouse 1969). The cut
nail implies occupation before 1900, since wire
nails rapidly replaced cut nails after the 1890s
(Wells 1998:95–96).

quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas O’Bar
Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is in the southwest quadrant of the tract, north of County
Road 2195. For a history of land ownership
before 1901, see 41RK690. The property may
have been occupied in the nineteenth century by tenants when it was owned by James
and Margaret Langhorne, James Winright
Flanagan, John Phelps and sons Ashton and
William A. Phelps, Walter C. Robinson, and
Richard B. Levy and E. F. Young, since all of
these owners lived elsewhere (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records).
F. W. Petty owned the 69-acre parcel on
which 41RK692 and 41RK700 are situated by
1901, when he sold the land to Ansel Walter
Capps for $155.25 (Rusk County, Deed Record
57:33). Capps owned a total of 618 acres out
of the O’Bar Survey, appraised at $1,330, and
had 10 equine, 10 bovine, 10 swine, a wagon,
and other personal property (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records). It is doubtful that either
Petty or Capps lived at 41RK692.
In 1902, Capps sold the land to James M.
Oden for $207 (Rusk County, Deed Record
54:99). Oden was land-rich entrepreneur
with 2,768 acres out of the O’Bar Survey and
smaller holdings out of two other nearby surveys. In 1904, his real and personal property
was appraised at $27,835 and included merchandise, machines, and a steam engine. With
lucrative business ventures nearby, it was
unlikely Oden occupied the property (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). He also
owned a sawmill (Johnson 1996b). Oden had
defaulted on his loan by 1908, when the 69acre parcel was sold with other lands through
a sheriff ’s deed to Eliza Kempner for $2,100
(Rusk County, Deed Records D:461, D:584,
62:230). She did not live in Rusk County (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). The land
changed hands repeatedly between 1911 and
1917, and it is unlikely to have been owner
occupied during these years.

Prehistoric artifacts were distributed between
0 and 60 cm in 8 shovel tests, with six artifacts
(60 percent) at 20–40 cm. Historic artifacts were
distributed across a similar depth range among 14
shovel tests, with a number of artifacts recovered
deeper than most of the prehistoric artifacts. This
indicates a well-mixed artifact assemblage, not
surprising given the active animal burrowing that
was observed on the surface. Prehistoric artifact
density per positive shovel test is 1.2 whereas the
historic artifact density is 3.9.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine
sand (Griffith 2000). The average shovel test
depth was 57 cm with a range of 20–100 cm,
and the average depth to the argillic horizon
in the 30 tests that reached it was 54 cm. The
typical profile (Shovel Test DB278) consists of
upper loosely consolidated silty sand varying
from brown, to light brown, to light yellow with
occasional ironstone gravels above well-consolidated orange sandy clay.

Summary and Assessment
The land on which 41RK692 is situated
had a succession of owners during the last
half of the nineteenth century and the early
twentieth century, none of whom lived on the
tract. Hence, the historic probable farmstead
component likely reflects occupation by tenants.

It is considered ineligible for National Register

Description
Site 41RK693 is a prehistoric ceramic and
lithic scatter at elevations of 320–330 ft atop an
interfluve on the south side of Cherokee Bayou
floodplain (Figure 4.30). It is confined primarily
to the midslope area just below the summit and
would have afforded access to the mouth of a
small north-flowing stream. The site overlooks
the surrounding floodplain, and steep slopes surround the interfluve. Vegetation is dense deciduous woodlands and secondary growth that give
way to dense wetland vegetation below. There is
an open grassy area along a gas well access road
northeast of a gas well pad. Disturbances include
pig rooting, the gas well access road, erosion, tree
throws, and an ATV two-track road on the east
edge of the site. The site also has been clearcut

may date to the Early Caddo period, but none of
the sherds are diagnostic to that interval.
Prehistoric artifacts are distributed vertically within the upper 60 cm of the deposits,
with only 1 sherd being recovered at 60–80 cm.
Thirty-eight artifacts, or 88 percent, were in the
upper 40 cm, with 42 percent at 0–20 cm and
46 percent at 20–40 cm. No cultural features
were found during shovel testing. Supporting
evidence such as burned clay was sparse, and
scant charcoal was observed.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine
sand characteristic of upland interfluve ridge
landforms (Griffith 2000). Average shovel test
depth was 63 cm, and the average argillic horizon depth was 60 cm, varying from 30 to 100 cm,
in the 21 tests that reached it.

of a county road (Figure 4.32). The interfluve
is oriented north-south and is on the west side
of a narrow stream valley draining northward
to Cherokee Bayou. The structure is within a
copse of large old hackberry, oak, and sycamore
trees surrounded by pastures. Other plants
include yuccas, honeysuckle, grasses, and
dewberry vines. The site area evidences active
animal burrowing, limited erosion around the
supporting piers of the barn, and general decay
associated with a structure that is not regularly maintained and utilized. Eight shovel
tests were excavated around the barn, and no
artifacts were recovered (see Table 4.1). The
site measures 45 m north-south by 50 m eastwest, based on the structure and surrounding
fenced enclosure.
The barn has a gabled roof, elevated interior
wood floor, narrow front door, and no back door.
It contained recently stored boxes and piles of
household goods. The original structure was
about 20x25 ft with a later addition on the west
side measuring 15x25 ft. It is of pier and beam
construction with rectangular precast concrete
piers. Interior flooring is a mix of 1x8-, 1x4-,
and 2x4-inch lumber and wire nails. Rafters are
2x4-inch and other lumber sizes roofed over with
sheets of corrugated galvanized metal. Vertical
roofing support posts are long 4x4-inch posts
with 2x4-inch extensions nailed to the tops to
increase the roof height. There is no elevated
construction in the interior for extra storage.
The interior is open except for vertical roofing
supports. An informant reports that the barn is
at least 30 years old (William Barrett, personal
communication, April 12, 2012), but it must postdate 1960, since it is not on the aerial photograph
taken that year. Because of its recent age and
nonresidential function, no archival research
was done for the site.
There are two fenced enclosure areas
around the barn. On is north behind the barn,
and the other is west of it; they have wood fence
posts and barbed wire. A chute made of railroad
tie posts with 2x8-inch wood boards and barbed
wire parallels the west wall of the barn and
would have directed livestock into the northern
pen. Metal pasture gates provide entry into each
of the two larger pens.
Soils are mapped as Darco loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000). Average shovel test depth was
83 cm, and only two of the tests reached an argillic horizon at 45 and 70 cm.

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK693 is a prehistoric ceramic
and lithic scatter situated on an interfluve
summit above the Cherokee Bayou floodplain.
The various disturbances appear to have had
only modest impacts on the site deposits. It is
one of only two sites in the project area where
Caddo ceramics substantially outnumber lithics.
Although midden deposits were not identified
and the overall artifact density is low, 41RK693
appears to represent Caddo occupations that
were associated with the nearby mound centers
at the Hudnall-Pirtle, Lane Mitchell, or Pine
Tree Mound sites. Sites such as this would have
functioned within settlement systems consisting
of a number of site types, including multifamily
villages, smaller residential hamlets, campsites,
and resource procurement and processing areas.
If interpretable components can be isolated,
41RK693 would contribute to a better understanding of those settlement systems. Site
41RK693 is considered potentially eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places
under Criterion D, pending test excavations to
more fully gauge its age, content, and integrity.
Site 41RK694
Description
Site 41RK694 is a mid-twentieth-century barn with associated livestock pens and

is at the confluence of two small streams that
merge and flow north to Cherokee Bayou. The
interfluve has an excellent vantage point view
of the wetland to the east and the stream confluence. The floodplain widens to about 100 m
north of the confluence. A swampy area is on
the east side of the drainage and the site. Part
of the site has short grasses within a small
clearing, and part is in deciduous hardwood
forest with an open understory. Cattails, reeds,
and grasses are present in the wetland. The
wetland is created in part by beaver dams.
Disturbances include active animal burrowing, slope erosion, vegetation clearing, and a
currently used ATV trail. South of the site on

Thirteen shovel tests were excavated to
define a site area measuring 85 m north-south
by 25 m east-west. Prehistoric artifacts were
recovered in 5 tests producing an artifact
density of 2.0 per positive test (see Table 4.1).
The recovered assemblage consists of four
plain ceramic sherds (Figure 4.34a), one pitted
stone (Figure 4.34b), one complete flake, one
proximal flake fragment, two medial flake
fragments, and a piece of shatter. In addition,
six small pieces of possible fire-cracked rock
were found in Shovel Test DB315 but not
collected. The sherds are too small to be very
diagnostic, but all are plain clay-paste wares
consistent with Caddo pottery. The fact that all

are undecorated suggests they may relate to an
Early Caddo occupation. The pitted stone is of
ferruginous sandstone, and the lithic debitage
is represented by four pieces of Ogallala chert
and one piece of petrified wood. All artifacts
were recovered in the upper 25 cm.
Soils are mapped as Latex very fine sandy
loam, typical of convex interstream divides in
portions of the project area (Griffith 2000:58).
The average shovel test depth was 27 cm with
a range of 19–38 cm. The common shovel test
profile has an upper 13-cm-thick zone of finegrained sandy loam with abundant gravels and
roots above ca. 20 cm of light yellowish-brown
fine-grained sandy loam with dense gravels
and abundant roots. The argillic horizon is
well-consolidated pale orange gravelly clay. The

recovered assemblage is small, it does include
four plain prehistoric ceramic sherds, which
might indicate an Early Caddo component connected to the Hudnall-Pirtle site. The setting and
the low artifact density suggest that it might
be a campsite related to resource procurement

postholes and pits. Site 41RK695 is considered

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK695 is a small Caddo occupation
atop an interfluve at the confluence of two small
north-flowing streams in the uplands well back
from the valley wall. It is the only site in the
uplands proper that has a chance of having an
interpretable Caddo component. Although the

The road was used as a logging access path
for equipment when the parcel was timbered,
judging by the remnants of debris piles and
discarded motor oil and chainsaw oil containers.
Logging activities, slope erosion, active animal
burrowing, and pig rooting have churned the
site surface. A gas pipeline on the south edge of
the site runs east-west and then takes a turn to
the southwest. The north and east site edges are
defined by abrupt slopes and a small drainage.
There is no indication of historic occupation or
improvements at this location on historic maps
and aerial photographs.
Twenty shovel tests were excavated to
define a site area measuring 55 m north-south
by 125 m east-west. Ten shovel tests were
positive and yielded 56 artifacts (see Table
4.1). The prehistoric artifact density is only
1.5 per positive test, whereas the historic
artifact density is 5.9 per positive test. The

of petrified wood shatter at 0–20 cm and 2
Ogallala chert flakes at 0–20 cm. The historic

Site 41RK696
Description
Site 41RK696 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
and probable historic farmstead on a shoulder
and backslope of an upland interfluve on the
south side of a small drainage at an elevation
of 310–320 ft (Figure 4.35). The location is an
open grassy clearing within dense secondary
vegetation of yaupons, elms, and other deciduous
trees. The clearing is related to logging activities and may have been an area where logging
equipment was staged. The site is along a fence
line with pastures on the south side and dense
secondary growth with scattered isolated older
deciduous trees on the north side. A narrow
two-track road parallels the fence line on the
northern wooded side and traverses the site.

Kuykendall was also a retail merchant in a
general store. His brother, John W. Kuykendall,
resided with the family and was a salesman in
the store (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census 1920). In 1930, the family was
farming on their property along the Tatum-toFlanagan Road (U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of the Census 1930b).
Kuykendall died in 1937, and his widow
and heirs, with Ben T. Cook, T. J. and M. E.
Wright, Plummer and Lillie Mann, and Mose
and Cynthia Harkless, sold the 266.7-acre parcel
on which 41RK696 and 41RK711 are situated
to Herman Orr in 1939 for $10 (Rusk County,
Deed Record 333:554). The land remains in the
Orr family (Rusk County, Appraisal District
Records 2013).

artifacts consist of 18 pieces of container glass
(brown, aqua, green, and clear), 1 clear glass
tumbler sherd, 1 milk glass sherd, 7 pieces of
window glass, 1 piece of lamp chimney glass,
2 pieces of undecorated whiteware, 12 wire
nails, 4 unidentified brick fragments, 1 piece of
mortar or concrete, 2 sections of chain, and 5
pieces of plastic. The wire nails and plastic are
consistent with occupation during the twentieth
century (Spude 2014; Wells 1998:87), while the
remainder of the assemblage could date to either
the nineteenth or twentieth century and thus
is not diagnostic. Survey identified no features
such as a well or cistern depression or building
footing stones. Historic artifacts were recovered
from the surface to 100 cm, with 74 percent
(n = 39) from the upper 20 cm.
Soils are mapped as Kirvin fine sandy loam
(Griffith 2000). Shovel test depth varied between
12 and 105 cm, averaging 44 cm. Argillic horizon depth ranged between 12 and 105+ cm and
averaged 39 cm. Sediments examined in the
shovel tests are loosely consolidated fine brown
silty sand with pea-sized ironstone gravels. The
argillic horizon was pale orange sandy clay.
Shovel tests on the north side of the interfluve
did not reach a clay horizon.

Summary and Assessment
The historic component at 41RK696 is a
probable farmstead on land associated with
the Ansel Walter Capps family from 1892 to
1918 and the Robert Owen Kuykendall family
from 1918 until 1939. The fact that it is not
on any of the historic aerial photographs and
the nature of the artifacts suggest that it represents a brief occupation during the late part
of the Capps’ ownership or the early part of the
Kuykendalls’ ownership. The sparseness of the
archeological remains argues against this being
a sustained farmstead occupation, and since the
Kuykendalls lived at 41RK697 to the southeast,
41RK696 may represent a tenant occupation.
It is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places because it
dates entirely to the twentieth century, has no
features that could provide information on site
layout, apparently was occupied by tenants and
thus is of unknown associations, and has been
badly disturbed, all of which indicate that it
is a poor candidate for contributing important
archeological information about the history of
the area. No further archeological investigation
is recommended.
The prehistoric component at 41RK696 is a
sparse scatter of lithic debris in an upland setting. It likely represents very short-term use of
the location. The scarceness of artifacts, upland
setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable organic materials indicate that
isolating components and dating them would be

Site History
Site 41RK696 is on Tract R026-008, which
encompasses 266.7 acres out of the northwest
quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas O’Bar
Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is in the southwest quadrant of the tract near its south edge,
east of the route County Roads 2914, 2196D, and
2212 follow. For the history of the land before
1918, see 41RK711.
In 1918, Ansel Walter Capps sold the
212-acre parcel on which 41RK696 is situated
to Robert Owen Kuykendall for $2,250 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 99:319). During the next
seven years, Kuykendall amassed a farmstead
that included four adjoining parcels out of the
O’Bar Survey, a 156-acre parcel out of the nearby
John A. Gray Survey, and other lands (Rusk
County, Deed Records 99:319, 100:546; 101:240,
110:77–79; 113:103; 115:457, 126:301, 250:579,

(Corcoran 2013). In 1910, the young couple
had been renting a house, and he worked as a
merchant in a grocery store (U.S. Department

historic artifacts: 28 sherds of container glass
(aqua, amber, green, and clear), 1 sherd of lamp
chimney glass, 15 pieces of window glass, 2 plain
whiteware sherds, 9 wire nails, 18 unidentified
nails, 1 nail or screw, 2 bolts or spikes, 1 metal
button, 1 stainless steel eyelet, 6 pieces of unidentifiable metal, and 5 unidentified brick fragments (see Table 4.1). The recovered artifacts
provide a density of 11.1 items per positive test.
The artifacts were concentrated in the upper
40 cm with 56 percent (n = 51) at 0–20 cm and
41 percent (n = 38) at 20–40 cm. Other than the
brick fragments, no structural debris or related
features such as a well or cistern or footing
stones were found, probably because the area
was cleared when it was converted to pasture.
The wire nails and stainless steel eyelet are
consistent with occupation during the twentieth
century (History of Stainless Steel 2014; Wells
1998:87), while the remainder of the assemblage
could date to either the nineteenth or twentieth
century and thus is not diagnostic.

Site 41RK697
Description
Site 41RK697 is a historic farmstead in
an upland setting at the west edge of an open
pasture at the intersection of County Roads
2194 and 2195 (Figure 4.36). A single structure
is present on this location on the 1938 road map,
and the 1930, 1939, and 1960 aerial photographs
depict at least one building. Vegetation consists
only of short grasses. Disturbances include previous land clearing, erosion, and animal burrowing.

mained extant on the land in 1960, and the
land was in agricultural use (U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1960).
In 1968, Kuykendall sold the land, now
approximately 97.269 acres, to George D. and
Marjorie Moran for $12,300 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 880:292). In 1996, Moran conveyed the
land to Gary A. and Candy Eberhart, who retain
ownership (Rusk County, Appraisal District
Records 2013).

Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000). Shovel test depths varied from
27 to 55 cm and averaged 42 cm. The average
argillic horizon depth was 40 cm and varied
from 23 to 50 cm. The typical profile in Shovel
Test DB367 revealed a light grayish-brown
loosely consolidated gravelly sandy silt above
yellowish-brown moderately consolidated sandy
gravelly silt. The argillic horizon is a bright
reddish brown sandy clay.
Site History

Summary and Assessment

Site 41RK697 is on Tract R343-003, which
encompasses 97.269 acres out of the northwest
quadrant of the 318-acre John A. Gray Survey
(see Figure 4.8). The site is along the west edge
of the tract, near the northeast corner of the
intersection of County Roads 2194 and 2195.
By 1919, Emma Caroline Hendrick Tatum
Shaw held 156 acres out of the Gray Survey, and
she sold the land that year to Angus P. Miller
for $3,600 (Rusk County, Deed Record 100:348).
Shaw had hired Miller to manage her several
properties, and they lived near each other on
farms they each owned along the Longview and
Harmony Hill Road in Harmony Hill. Miller had
married Elizabeth V. Flewellyn, and they had a
cook and a maid in 1920 (Dockall et al. 2010:98;
U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the
Census 1920). It is unclear whether the land
was occupied between 1919 and 1922.
In 1922, the Millers sold the 156 acres
to Robert Owen Kuykendall $3,120 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 122:85). He was a Tatum
merchant who lived on the farm he owned
with his wife, Nora Anna Graham Kuykendall,
two sons, and his brother (U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1920). In
1930, the Kuykendalls had four children living
at home, and improvements were in the location
of 41RK697 (Tobin International 1930; U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
1930b). By 1934, Kuykendall was bankrupt
(Rusk County, Deed Record 250:579). He died in
1937 (Corcoran 2013). Between 1944 and 1959,
his heirs conveyed parcels out of this land, whittling the holdings (Rusk County, Deed Records
378:140, 379:315, 410:238, 412:626, 664:57).
In 1959, the Kuykendall heirs conveyed
the estate’s remaining holdings to one of Nora’s
sons, William T. Kuykendall, for $10 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 668:438). A building re-

Site 41RK697 is a farmstead associated
with Robert Owen and Nora Kuykendall beginning in 1922 and with their descendants until
1968. It is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places because it
dates entirely to the twentieth century, was occupied until at least 1960, and has no features
that could provide information on site layout,
all of which indicate that it is a poor candidate
for contributing important archeological information about the history of the area. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.
Site 41RK698
Description
Site 41RK698 is a historic farmstead at an
elevation of 330 ft on an upland summit adjacent
to County Road 2199 (Figure 4.37). The site is
defined by a thick stand of deciduous trees and
mimosas in a large fallow pasture. Disturbances
include erosion, active animal burrowing, and
recent trash dumping. A complex of structures
is shown at this location on the 1930, 1939, and
1960 aerial images.
Nine shovel tests were excavated to define
a site area measuring 35 m north-south by 30 m
east-west. Six shovel tests contained artifacts
resulting in a density of 8.3 items per positive
test. The recovered assemblage of 50 artifacts
consists of clear container glass, window glass,
plain whiteware sherds, wire nails, a nail or
bolt, a sanitary can, unidentified metal pieces,
and unidentified brick fragments (see Table 4.1).
The wire nails and sanitary can are consistent
with occupation during the twentieth century
(Busch 1981:97–98; Wells 1998:87), while the
remainder of the assemblage could date to either
138

the nineteenth or twentieth century and thus
is not diagnostic. Surface indications include a
single possible footing stone and scattered flower
bulbs. Most artifacts were recovered at 0–20 cm,
although in Shovel Test VH293, corroded metal
fragments, a wire nail, and corroded can fragments were recovered between 20 and 50 cm.
Soils are mapped as Sawlit-Sawtown
complex consisting of loams and sandy loams
(Griffith 2000:81). These soil types are common
on level to gently sloping uplands and terraces.
The average shovel test depth was 53 cm. An
argillic horizon was not encountered due to
increasing pea-sized gravels below 50 cm and
dense roots.

By 1903, Ashton Phelps owned 2,630 acres
out of the O’Bar Survey, when he sold the land to
James M. Oden for $11,835 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 54:97). With lucrative business ventures
nearby, it was unlikely Oden occupied the property (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
Oden had defaulted on his loan by 1908,
when the parcel was sold with other lands
through a sheriff’s deed to Eliza Kempner for
$2,100 (Rusk County, Deed Records D:461,
D:584, 62:230). She did not live in Rusk County
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
The land changed hands repeatedly between 1911 and 1916, and it is unlikely to have
been owner occupied during these years. In
September 1911, Kempner sold the land with
other parcels to John M. Roots and Willis K.
Menefee for $21,592 (Rusk County, Deed Record
70:594). The two men subdivided the land into
smaller parcels and, in January 1912, sold a onethird interest in 10 parcels to Walter L. Roots for
$3,000 (Rusk County, Deed Record 72:98). That
May, John M. Roots and his wife conveyed their
one-third interest to Menefee, and about a year

and he did not claim the property as his homestead (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records;
U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the
Census 1930b, 1940).
In 1936, Kinsey sold the land to Ivy “Jake”
Allen (1909–1981) for $10 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 284:569; Wilcox 2012). Allen was stationed at Fort Crockett as a private in the army
in 1940. He had married his wife, Kathryn, by
1945 (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of
the Census 1940). In 1939, improvements were
in the location of 41RK698 (U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939). The Allens probably
occupied the property at some points during
their ownership and claimed it as their homestead in 1945 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records).
In February 1945, Ivy and Kathryn Allen
sold the land to Edgar Blackmon for $500 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 383:129). Ten months
later, Blackmon and his wife sold the land to
J. W. and Carrie Thornberry for $800 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 395:168). In 1960, improvements remained in the location of 41RK698
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1960).
By 1988, Malcolm L. and Josie Ross owned
the land. That year they conveyed it to the Ward
Rosson Land Company, which retains ownership
(Rusk County, Appraisal District Records 2013).

later, Walter L. Roots sold his one-third interest to Menefee for $4,187 (Rusk County, Deed
Records 72:478, 76:457). In 1913, Menefee sold
his one-half interest in several parcels of land
to R. L. McInnis for $5,500 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 76:56). Each of these owners held other
lands and likely did not occupy this property
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In January 1916, R. L. McInnis sold his
interest in the land to Gaines B. Turner, who,
with Menefee, sold the 25-acre parcel on which
41RK698 is situated, known as Tract No. 15, to
Missouri native Charles E. Griffith (1887–1950)
for $500 (Rusk County, Deed Record 88:314;
Tricia the Spirit Chaser 2005a). Griffith and
his native-Texan wife, Nettie Cobb (1878–1971),
also owned a lot in Tatum where they lived
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records; Tricia
the Spirit Chaser 2005b). They may have used
the land for agricultural purposes but probably
did not live on it (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records).
In 1918, Charles E. and Nettie Griffith
sold the 25-acre parcel to his father, Ohio
native Charles A. Griffith (1852–1934), for $500
(Anonymous 2010a; Rusk County, Deed Record
100:252; U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census 1920; U.S. Department of the
Interior, Census Office 1900a). He lived with his
Kentucky-born wife, Eletha Florence Stapleton
(1871–1940), on their farm along the Chrystal
Farms Road in 1920 with a grandson, Charles M.
Homer (Anonymous 2010b; U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1920). The
property was generally appraised at $200 (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1928, the Griffiths sold the land to
Illinois native Marshall Rogers for $1,000 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 143:19). He and his Texasborn wife, Mable Lee, lived on the property
briefly (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1929, Rogers sold the land to Joe and
Fannie Blackmon for $1,000 (Rusk County,
Deed Record 146:16). The Blackmons lived on
the property for a few years (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records). Cropland surrounded
improvements in the location of 41RK698 in
1930 (Tobin International 1930).
In 1933, Joe and Fannie Blackmon sold the
land to Joe Sewell Kinsey for $1 (Rusk County,
Deed Record 243:410). Kinsey lived with his
parents, Thomas M. and Helen M. Kinsey, along
the Chrystal Farms Road in both 1930 and 1940,

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK698 is a farmstead on land owned
by Charles A. and Eletha Florence Stapleton
Griffith (1918–1928), Marshall and Mable Lee
Rogers (1928–1929), Joe and Fannie Blackmon
(1929–1933), Joe Sewell Kinsey (1933–1936),
Ivy “Jake” and Kathryn Allen (1936–1945), and
J. W. and Carrie Thornberry (1945 and later).
The archeological remains observed could relate
to occupation by any one, or more, of these families. It is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places because it
dates entirely to the twentieth century, was occupied until at least 1960, has no features that
could provide information on site layout, and has
uncertain associations, all of which indicate that
it is a poor candidate for contributing important
archeological information about the history of
the area. No further archeological investigation
is recommended.

indicate several structures on this location from
the 1930s through at least 1960. At the time of
survey and recording, the site included a standing
house, barn or large shed, a small shed, and pen
for pets or small livestock.
The extant structures are spread roughly
north to south for 70 m. The residence is at the
north end, and the barn is at the south end. The
house is a small L-plan board-and-batten structure with remnants of an exterior machine-made
brick fireplace on the northeast side and a machine-made brick-lined well at the southeast

Description
Site 41RK699 is a historic farmstead in uplands at an elevation of 340 ft west of the intersection of County Roads 2194 and 2195 (Figure 4.38).
County Road 2194 is on the north side, and large
maintained pastures are south and southwest.
The site area is vegetated by large oak, elm, and
other deciduous trees with an open to moderately
open understory. Aerial images and historic maps

corner of the back of the house. Supports for
the house are 8–12-inch-diameter wood post
segments. The house has three rooms, a living
room and bedroom on the north front of the house
and a similarly sized kitchen on the back. These
rooms are roughly 10x10 or 12x12 ft in size. The
floor is constructed of tongue-and-groove boards.
Walls are of 1x12-inch milled lumber covered in
remnants of old wallpaper. In the middle of the
wall separating the northwest front room and the
kitchen is a machine-made brick structure with
upper wooden cupboards that covered flues for
wood-burning stoves in each room. The stoves are
not present, and the house was converted to gas
heat at some point. Gas, water, and electric lines
are present beneath the floor. The windows and
frames are missing, and the exterior brick chimney has been removed down to the basal bricks.
Some window frames or portions are in the barn
or large shed south of the residence. Ceilings are
of 1x6- and 1x8-inch lumber. Roofed porches are
on the front and back of the house. The front
porch supports are constructed of machine-made
bricks, cut sandstone, and poured concrete, and
the porch roof includes mixed lumber (mainly
1x4s and 1x6s) covered in corrugated tin. The
back porch is 1x4-inch lumber with similar wood
used for flooring. It was also roofed with corrugated metal. The house floor is about 0.75 m above
the ground at the front and about 0.90 m above
the ground surface at the back. Ferris and Cole
bricks were used to construct the chimney base
and portions of the front porch.
Directly behind the southeast corner of the
house and about 3 m from the well is a small
8x8-ft storage or garden shed made of galvanized corrugated tin sheets nailed to a frame of
1x4- and 2x4-inch milled lumber. The shed has
a partial wood floor of railroad ties and 2x8-inch
boards. Windows are present in the north and
south walls, and the door is in the west wall. The
southwest corner and roof have collapsed due to
a large fallen hackberry tree limb. This shed is
more recent than the house and probably was
built in the 1960s–1970s.
About 9 m behind the house is a small
rough-made tin and wood doghouse and an enclosure fence of galvanized posts and chain-link
fencing. The shelter is about 1.5x1.2 m in size,
and the fenced enclosure is about 6x9 m. Other
construction materials inside the enclosure and
along the fenced area include mixed sizes of
milled lumber and 4x4-inch wood posts.

About 23 m south of this small animal pen
is a small barn oriented roughly east-west. The
exterior is covered in overlapping corrugated tin
sheeting. The structure is elevated on cut beams
placed on precast concrete footers. The floor
is 1x12- and 1x10-inch lumber with the same
lumber used as floor joists. The wall supports and
roof rafters are 2x4-inch boards. There is a 4-ftwide entryway on the east wall and a window in
the west wall. A 12x12-ft area in the northwest
corner is enclosed by walls of 1x12-inch lumber
as a work or tool area. All construction was done
with wire nails. There is a collapsed exterior
roofed area of undetermined size on the west
wall. A small galvanized wire and post pen is on
the northwest corner of this structure.
All standing structures have been left
to ruin and decay. Erosion, tree fall, animal
burrowing, and scavenging of scrap building
materials and bricks have also compromised
their integrity. Scattered push piles are visible
indications that mechanical clearing or dumping
has disturbed areas of the site surface.
Nine shovel tests were excavated, and six of
them contained artifacts (see Table 4.1). Combined
with the extant structures, the shovel test evidence
indicates that the site measures 75 m north-south
by 50 m east-west. Seventeen historic artifacts
were recovered from the tests: 6 pieces of clear
container glass, 1 green container glass sherd, a
piece of window glass, 2 plain whiteware sherds,
a plastic button, 4 wire nails, and 2 pieces of flat
metal. Nine artifacts are from 0–20 cm, 5 are from
20–40 cm, and 3 are from 40–60 cm. The artifact
density is 2.8 per positive test. The wire nails and
plastic button are consistent with occupation in
the twentieth century (Spude 2014; Wells 1998:87),
while the remainder of the assemblage could date
to either the nineteenth or twentieth century and
thus is not diagnostic.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000). Average shovel test depth was
55 cm, and maximum depths ranged from 25 to
90 cm. Argillic horizon depth varied from 25 to
70 cm. These tests revealed a slightly consolidated brown fine sandy loam or silty loam with
few or no gravels.
Site History
Site 41RK699 (Resources 18A and 18B)
is on Tract R026-048, which encompasses
258.34 acres out of the northeast quadrant of the

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
Summary and Assessment

4,428.4-acre Thomas O’Bar Survey (see Figure
4.8). The site is at the north edge of the tract,
near its northeast corner, along the south side of
County Road 2195, just west of its intersection
with County Road 2194. For a history of land
ownership until 1911, see 41RK698.
In 1911, John M. Roots and Willis K. Menefee
sold the 27-acre parcel on which 41RK699 is situated, known as Tract No. 12, to Thomas M. Kinsey
for $540 (Rusk County, Deed Record 72:109).
Kinsey built a house and barn (Resources 18A
and 18B) on the land. The following year, Roots
and Menefee sold Kinsey an adjoining 27-acre
parcel known as Tract No. 13, and in 1917 Kinsey
acquired an adjacent 25.37-acre parcel known as
Tract No. 14, for total holdings of 79.37 acres out
of the O’Bar Survey; the lands were appraised
at $700 by 1920 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records; Rusk County, Deed Records 75:259,
103:285). Kinsey lived with his wife, Helen, and
their only child, Joe Sewell, on their farm along
the Chrystal Farms Road in 1920, 1930, and
1940 (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census 1920, 1930b, 1940). He briefly
acquired another 24-acre parcel out of the O’Bar
Survey in the late 1920s and about 145 acres
out of the Hicks Survey by 1935, which they
claimed as their homestead both that year and
in 1940. Thus, in later years, tenants may have
occupied 41RK699 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records). Cropland surrounded the substantial
improvements present at 41RK699 in 1930, and
these remained in place in 1939, with terraced
crops that year. Their two adjacent parcels had
large stands of trees (Tobin International 1930;
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1939).
In 1941, the Kinseys sold the 27-acre
parcel on which 41RK699 is situated and the
two adjoining parcels to Malcolm L. and Josie
Ross for $1,500 (Rusk County, Deed Record
352:610). The Rosses claimed a lot in Tatum
as their homestead in 1945, and thus tenants
may have occupied the property (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). The improvements
at 41RK699 remained intact as late as 1960,
with stands of trees on the two adjacent parcels
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1960).
The Rosses owned the land until 1988, when
they conveyed it to the Ward Rosson Land
Company, which retains ownership (Rusk
County, Appraisal District Records 2013).

Site 41RK699 is a farmstead associated with
Thomas M. and Helen M. Kinsey from 1911 until
1941 and with Malcolm L. and Josie Ross from
1941 until 1988. It is likely that tenants occupied
the land, especially after 1934. It is considered
ineligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places because it dates entirely to the
twentieth century, has abundant remains relating to occupation until at least mid-century, and
was occupied by tenants and thus is of unknown
associations for part of its history, all of which
indicate that it is a poor candidate for contributing important archeological information about
the history of the area. No further archeological
investigation is recommended.
Site 41RK700
Description
Site 41RK700 is a historic farmstead in an
upland pasture at an elevation of 340 ft along the
west side of County Road 2194 (Figure 4.39). The
site surface is vegetated in short grasses and a
few hardwood trees. The only surface evidence
of the site consists of a partial wooden animal
corral parallel to the fence along the county road,
along with ornamental trees like crepe myrtles.
Historic aerial photographs indicate at least one
building here by 1939, if not earlier that decade,
and still there in 1960. Erosion and active animal
burrowing are the most obvious disturbances.
The only site feature is the corral or livestock pen remnant. The corral section extends
about 34 m along a section of barbed wire fence
paralleling the west side of County Road 2195.
Two ornamental crepe myrtle trees are adjacent
to the south end of the corral fence portion. The
corral segment is made of railroad ties as vertical
posts with 1x6-inch boards nailed between them.
Eight shovel tests were excavated to define
a site area measuring 45 m north-south by 35 m
east-west. Five tests contained 33 historic artifacts: 9 pieces of container glass (clear, brown, and
aqua), 1 milk glass sherd, 7 pieces of window glass,
4 whiteware sherds, 1 wire nail and 6 unidentified
nails, 1 nail or piece of wire, 3 pieces of flat metal,
and 1 unidentified brick fragment (see Table 4.1).
The artifact density is 6.6 pieces per positive test.
Twenty-two items were found at 0–20 cm, and 11
came from 20–40 cm. The wire nail is consistent

could date to either the nineteenth or twentieth
century and thus is not diagnostic.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000). Shovel test depth averaged 56 cm
and ranged from 40 to 70 cm. Typical site stratigraphy was observed in Shovel Test DB462 and
consisted of about 40 cm of loosely consolidated
brown sandy silt with a few small gravels above
30 cm of loosely consolidated brown to yellowish-brown sandy silt or silty sand with gravels.
The argillic horizon depth was variable but
averaged 52 cm in the six tests that reached it.

of the northeast quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre
Thomas O’Bar Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site
is near the center of the east edge of the tract,
along County Road 2194. For a history of early
land ownership, see 41RK690.
F. W. Petty owned the 69-acre parcel out
of the O’Bar Survey on which 41RK692 and
41RK700 are situated by 1901, when he sold the
land to Ansel Walter Capps for $155.25 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 57:33). Capps owned a total
of 618 acres out of the O’Bar Survey, appraised at
$1,330, and had 10 equine, 10 bovine, 10 swine,
a wagon, and other personal property (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records); he probably
did not live on his newly acquired land.
In 1902, Capps sold the land to James M.
Oden for $207 (Rusk County, Deed Record
54:99). Oden was a land-rich entrepreneur with
2,768 acres out of the O’Bar Survey and smaller

Carthage Road in 1910 with his son and their
six children (U.S. Department of Commerce and
Labor, Bureau of the Census 1910). By 1920,
they had moved to the farm on the O’Bar Survey
along the Chrystal Farms Road with eight of
their children (U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of the Census 1920). That year, his holdings out of the O’Bar Survey were appraised at
$800 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1924, the Bradleys sold the land to Albert
Olin Menefee for a total of $5,410.61 (Groves
2013a; Rusk County, Deed Records 54:598,
125:61–62, 267:216). For a history of land ownership after 1924, see 41RK684.
Improvements were in the location of
41RK700 in 1930 and 1939, with crop and pasture land surrounding them (Tobin International
1930; U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service 1939). By 1960, improvements apparently were still present (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1960).

holdings out of two other nearby surveys. In 1904,
his real and personal property was appraised at
$27,835 and included merchandise, machines,
and a steam engine. With lucrative business ventures nearby, it was unlikely Oden occupied the
property (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
He also owned a sawmill (Johnson 1996b).
Oden had defaulted on his loan by 1908,
when the 69-acre parcel was sold with other
lands through a sheriff’s deed to Eliza Kempner
for $2,100 (Rusk County, Deed Records D:461,
D:584, 62:230). She did not live in Rusk County
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
The land changed hands repeatedly between
1911 and 1917, and it is unlikely to have been
owner occupied during these years. In September
1911, Kempner sold the 69-acre parcel and other
lands to John M. Roots and Willis K. Menefee for
$21,592 (Rusk County, Deed Record 70:594). That
December, Capps quitclaimed a 34-acre parcel
out of the O’Bar Survey adjacent and to the west
to Menefee for $500 (Rusk County, Deed Record
72:252). In January 1912, the two men sold a onethird interest in the land to Walter L. Roots for
$3,000 (Rusk County, Deed Record 72:98). That
May, John M. Roots and his wife conveyed their
one-third interest to Menefee, and about a year
later, Walter L. Roots conveyed his one-third interest to Menefee for $4,187 (Rusk County, Deed
Records 72:478, 76:457). In 1913, Menefee sold
one-half interest in the 69-acre parcel and other
lands, to R. L. McInnis for $5,500 (Rusk County,
Deed Record 76:56). In 1914, Menefee sold the
34-acre parcel for $680 and, with McInnis, sold
the 69-acre parcel for $1,380 to S. C. Smith
and H. E. Hough (Rusk County, Deed Records
83:17–18). In 1915, McInnis sold the 69 acres
to W. P. Alexander for $10 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 84:173). In 1916, W. P. Alexander sold the
69 acres to Gaines B. Turner for $5,000. Turner
resided in Los Angeles by 1920 (Rusk County,
Deed Records 50:441, 84:251; U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1920). Each of
these owners held other lands and likely did not
occupy this property (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records).
In 1917, Smith and Hough, with their wives,
sold the 69-acre parcel on which 41RK692 and
41RK700 are situated, along with the adjacent
34-acre parcel, to African American Eddie B.
Bradley for $1 (Rusk County, Deed Record
243:301). Bradley and his wife, Argustus, were
living on their farm along the Longview and

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK700 (Resource 31) was a farmstead
possibly associated with Eddie B. and Argustus
Bradley from 1917 to 1924 and subsequently
with tenants of the Menefees. It is considered
ineligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places because it dates entirely to the
twentieth century, has remains relating to occupation until at least mid-century, has no features
that could provide information on site layout, and
was occupied by tenants and thus is of unknown
associations for part of its history, all of which
indicate that it is a poor candidate for contributing important archeological information about
the history of the area. No further archeological
investigation is recommended.
Site 41RK701
Description
Site 41RK701 is a historic farmstead on a
shoulder to backslope setting in eroded uplands
at elevations of 310–320 ft (Figure 4.40). This location is above a floodplain and wetland formed
by an unnamed stream 250 m to the southwest.
The slopes are vegetated by scattered deciduous
trees and loblolly pines with open pasture ad145

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
jacent and northeast of the small wetland area.
No structures or other features are present, and
the only remnant of the farmstead is the linear
downslope scatter of historic artifacts recovered
from shovel tests on the south side of a well
pad access road overlooking the wetland area.
The area has been cleared mechanically, and
much, if not all, of the artifact scatter has been
displaced by clearing related to road and well
pad construction and, according to the present
landowners, bulldozing about 20 years ago to
construct a house that was never built. Other
disturbances include slope erosion, gullying,
and animal burrowing. Historical aerial imagery
shows a single building at this location in 1930
and 1939, but it was gone by 1960.
Eight shovel tests were excavated to define
a site area measuring 75 m northeast-south-

west by 25 m northwest-southeast. Seven tests
contained 30 artifacts consisting of 17 pieces of
clear and brown container glass, 3 pocket watch
fragments, 3 wire nails and 3 other probable nail
fragments, 2 pieces of unidentified metal, and
2 unidentified brick fragments (see Table 4.1).
The wire nails are consistent with occupation
in the twentieth century (Wells 1998:87), while
the remainder of the assemblage could date to
either the nineteenth or twentieth century and
thus is not diagnostic. Total artifact density per
positive test is 4.1. All but 1 item came from the
upper 40 cm.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine
sand (Griffith 2000). Average shovel test depth

parcels and a portion of the 100-acre parcel to
James “Jim” Cannon Kuykendall for $125 (Rusk
County, Deed Records 388:475, 391:402, 416:400,
433:399, 574:134, 578:387). Kuykendall acquired
additional nearby property over the years and, by
1945, owned Tract Nos. 35, 36, 38–40, and 61–68
and other lands (Rusk County, Deed Records
107:155, 121:554; 156:129, 305:350, 353:187,
377:527, 383:38, 388:475, 391:402, 416:400,
433:399, 459:204; 460:229, 574:134, 578:387).
In 1939, improvements were still present in the
location of 41RK701. The land was mostly in pasture or had stands of trees, and some was under
cultivation (U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service 1939). By 1960, no improvements were
apparent, and the land had reverted to pasture
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1960).
Kuykendall died in 1967, and in 1969 his
estate sold 61 acres out of the O’Bar Survey, including the 25-acre parcel on which 41RK701 is
situated, an additional parcel to the north, and
the 25-acre parcel adjoining to the west to John
Edwin Dodson for $7,625 (Anonymous 2010c;
Rusk County, Deed Record 903:26). Dodson and
his wife, Mary Helen, partitioned the land in
1973 (Rusk County, Deed Record 966:138). He
was deceased by 2005, and the land has belonged
to Mary Helen Dodson since that time (Rusk
County, Appraisal District Records 2013).

upper 55 cm consisting of brown to light brown
loosely consolidated sandy silt with a few small
gravels and below that 30 cm of loosely consolidated light yellowish-brown silty sand with a
few gravels. At 85 cm, the argillic horizon was
moderately consolidated yellowish-brown sandy
clay with ironstone gravels.
Site History
Site 41RK701 is on Tract R026-012, which
encompasses 61 acres out of the northeast quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas O’Bar Survey
(see Figure 4.8). The site is near the center of
the east edge of the tract, southwest of where
County Road 2213D makes a 90-degree turn.
In 1908, Ansel Walter Capps sold the 25acre parcel containing 41RK701 to Miles Norris
for $200 (Rusk County, Deed Record 65:607). In
1909, his property was appraised at $150, and
he had two equine, two bovine, and $5 in miscellaneous property (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records).
In 1912, Norris sold the land to James F.
Williams for $125 (Rusk County, Deed Record
65:608). The property was appraised at $165 in
1912, and he had four equine, two bovine, and a
wagon (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1918, he acquired a 25-acre parcel adjoining
to the west from Mrs. Mary Wilhelm, Mrs. Ronda
Wilhelm, and Mrs. Bennie Hendrick (Rusk
County, Deed Record 98:256). In 1920, his landholdings were appraised at $400 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). In 1925, Williams purchased a 100-acre parcel out of the O’Bar Survey,
on which 41RK688 is situated, to the north (Rusk
County, Deed Record 9105:3). Williams and his
wife, Lucinda, had eight children and lived on
the farm they owned, apparently at 41RK701,
by 1920, and the five older children attended
school (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census 1920). From 1925 until 1932,
his 150 acres were appraised at $1,000 (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). His first wife
was deceased by 1930, and he still lived on the
farm with his second wife, seven of his children,
and three of his stepchildren (U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1930b). That
year, there were improvements in the location of
41RK701, with cropland and pastureland on the
property (Tobin International 1930).
By 1933, Williams was deceased and his
heirs gradually sold the two adjoining 25-acre

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK701 was associated with Miles
Norris from 1908 to 1912, James F. Williams between 1912 and 1933, and James “Jim” Cannon
Kuykendall from 1933 to 1952. The Williams
family probably occupied the site, but Kuykendall
probably did not, given the amount of other property he owned. Hence, it likely was occupied by
tenants after 1933 until sometime before 1960. It
is considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places because it dates entirely
to the twentieth century, has remains relating to
occupation until near mid-century, has no features
that could provide information on site layout, was
occupied by tenants and thus is of unknown associations for part of its history, and has been badly
disturbed, all of which indicate that it is a poor
candidate for contributing important archeological
information about the history of the area. No further archeological investigation is recommended.

tests produced an assemblage of 97 artifacts
consisting of clear, green, cobalt blue, and
brown container glass; window glass; a piece
of possible lamp chimney glass; a piece of clear
ornamental glass; clear glass shatter; plain
whiteware sherds; wire nails; unidentified brick
fragments; fragments of a phonograph record; a
brass button; asphalt shingles; a piece of plastic; and unidentified metal (see Table 4.1). The
artifact density is 19.4 items per positive test.
Almost two-thirds (n = 63) of the assemblage
was recovered at 0–20 cm, and 30 percent was
at 20–40 cm. The wire nails, phonograph record
pieces, and asphalt shingles are consistent
with occupation during the twentieth century
(Encyclopaedia Britannica 2014; Preservapaedia
2010; Wells 1998:87), while the remainder of the
assemblage could date to either the nineteenth
or twentieth century and thus is not diagnostic.

(Griffith 2000), which are characteristic of steep
to moderately steep upland ridge slopes. The average shovel test depth and average depth of the

Description
Site 41RK702 is a historic farmstead on the
summit of an upland interfluve at an elevation
of 350 ft adjacent to County Road 2213D (Figure
4.41). A utility power line corridor constructed
between 1995 and 2004 passes through the
northeast part of the site and has impacted
that part of it. The site area is vegetated in scattered young loblolly pine trees and tall grasses.
Disturbances include erosion, animal burrowing,
mechanical clearing, and discard of material
along the adjacent county road. Mechanical
disturbance has removed all surface evidence of
preexisting structures or other cultural features.
Historic aerial photographs indicate at least
one structure here from the 1930s through at
least 1960.
Six shovel tests were excavated to define a
site area measuring 45 m northwest-southeast
by 15 m southwest-northeast. Five positive

investigation is recommended.
Site 41RK703
Description
Site 41RK703 is a broad lithic scatter
site atop an elongated topographic high on
the Cherokee Bayou floodplain at elevations
of 240–245 ft (Figure 4.42). On the south end
is a crescent-shaped, slightly higher portion of
land adjacent to a gas well pad. This small rise
is separated from the north part of the site by
a series of small interconnected sloughs and a
gas well road. The landform is slightly lower on
the north end but continues for about 340 m to
Cherokee Bayou. The eastern edge of the site
abuts a parcel vegetated in dense secondary
growth along a small unnamed tributary. This
tributary roughly defines the east edge of the
site. This entire area of the floodplain has been
cleared of all large trees, with the exception of
some scattered cypresses and oaks, and is now
vegetated in short grasses. This clearing was
done between 2005 and 2009 based on aerial
images. Portions of the surface have been
lightly tilled and planted in rye grass. Surface
depressions on the eastern third of the site
appear to have been filled in and leveled using
light-colored sand prior to grass planting. Other
disturbances include animal burrowing, erosion,
periodic flooding, tree removal and logging, cattle
trampling, and construction of a gas well pad,
access road, and pipeline.
Forty-seven shovel tests were excavated
and define a site area measuring 440 m northsouth by 120 m east-west. Twenty-five tests
were positive for prehistoric materials, yielding
66 lithic artifacts for a density of 2.6 items per
positive test (see Table 4.1). The assemblage has
62 pieces of debitage, 1 flake tool, 1 distal biface
or projectile point fragment (Figure 4.43a), and
1 piece of worked ochre (Figure 4.43b). The vertical distribution of artifacts is relatively even.
Only 5 percent of the assemblage was recovered
in the upper 20 cm. The remaining 95 percent
was well distributed between 20 and 100 cm:
18 percent at 20–40 cm, 27 percent at 40–60 cm,
29 percent at 60–80 cm, and 21 percent at
80–100 cm. The debitage consists of 32 complete
flakes, 7 proximal flake fragments, 9 medial
flake fragments, 6 distal flake fragments, and

Site History
Site 41RK702 is on Tract R026-018, which
encompasses 2 acres out of a 100-acre tract
in the northeast quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre
Thomas O’Bar Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site
is along the south edge of the tract, along the
north side of County Road 2213D, west of County
Road 2194. Willis and Georgia Mann purchased
the 100 acres in 1914 from G. H. Watson for
$750. The Manns claimed this 100-acre parcel
as their homestead by 1945 (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records), but it is unclear who
actually occupied the property, since the Manns
apparently lived at 41RK682 not far to the
west for much of the first half of the twentieth
century and were living in Longview by 1945.
Improvements were in the location of 41RK702
in 1930 and 1939, but a more-substantial collection of buildings and structures (not recorded as
an archeological site because of modern disturbance) was on the west portion of the 100-acre
parcel at the time (Tobin International 1930;
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1939). If
the Manns resided on the property, they likely
lived in the more heavily improved location on
the west side of it.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK702 is on land associated with
Willis and Georgia Mann and then their heirs
beginning in 1914. The Manns most likely lived
at other locations, however, and thus 41RK702
probably was occupied by tenants. It is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places because it dates entirely to the
twentieth century, was occupied until at least
1960, has no features that could provide information on site layout, and was occupied by tenants
and thus is of unknown associations, all of which
indicate that it is a poor candidate for contributing important archeological information about

shallow, extending only to 10–40 cm, were in
areas where the sediments were well consolidated, dry, and extremely hard. These areas correspond to Laneville loam soils. A well-defined

a

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK703 is a large lithic scatter
probably representing a series of campsites on
high ground above the Cherokee Bayou floodplain. The location within a frequently flooded
landscape suggests occupations were of short
duration and perhaps related to exploitation of
the surrounding bottomlands. It is one of five
sites spread along the length of the floodplain
east-west that could have the capacity to yield
useful information about Native American use
of the floodplain. No instances of archeological
remains within stratified Holocene alluvium
were observed in the shovel tests, but it is possible that such contexts could be present, particularly on the lower margins of the landform.
If so, it may be comparatively easy to isolate
components in some areas. The site did not
yield any temporally diagnostic artifacts, but
given the diagnostic artifacts found at other
floodplain sites, it is likely that it has a Caddo
component; thus, it may have the potential to
contribute to a better understanding of Caddo
settlement systems, particularly that associated
with the Early Caddo ceremonial center at the
Hudnall-Pirtle site on the Sabine River not far
to the northeast. Site 41RK703 is considered
potentially eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places under Criterion D,
pending test excavations to more fully gauge its
age, content, and integrity.

biface or dart point fragment; (b) worked ochre.

7 pieces of shatter (excludes 1 piece of debitage
lost in the field). Lithic material types reflect
the use of both local and nonlocal sources with
primary reliance on the former. Local materials
include Ogallala chert (n = 6) and quartzite
(n = 4); various mottled red, purple, brown, tan,
and yellow cherts (n = 20); hematite (n = 10);
petrified wood (n = 4); ochre (n = 1); ferruginous
sandstone (n = 1); and other quartzites (n = 5).
Nonlocal materials are gray chert (n = 9), white
chert (n = 3), black chert (n = 1), and novaculite
(n = 1). Nonlocal materials are 23 percent of the
assemblage. The black and gray chert could be
derived from either the Big Fork Formation in
southeastern Oklahoma or from gravel bars
along the Red River (Perttula 1984). The white
chert pieces could be from the Ozarks, Ouachitas,
or Edwards Plateau regions (Banks 1984, 1990).
The artifacts indicate lithic tool manufacture
and maintenance, but the absence of temporally
diagnostic items makes it impossible to assess
the site chronologically.
Soils are mapped as frequently flooded
Laneville loam (Griffith 2000). However, the
sandy deposits encountered during shovel
testing indicate that the sediments are more
appropriately classed as Iulus fine sandy loam
or Owentown fine sandy loam, which occur as
small areas within larger zones of Laneville
loam. The shovel tests ranged from 10 to 110 cm

Site 41RK704
Description
Site 41RK704 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
atop a very small isolated high point at elevations of 245–250 ft on the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain (Figure 4.44). The landform appears to
have been created by meandering of wet-weather
drainages to the north, east, and west as flood
waters drained into Cherokee Bayou. The site
deposits are deep, sandy, and well drained.

Adjacent drainages have isolated remnant cypresses that were not cut down when the rest
of the area was timbered and cleared for open
pasture. Disturbances include erosion, periodic
flooding, pig and cattle trampling, tree clearing,
and a gas pipeline along the northeast edge.
Nine shovel tests were excavated on and
around the small landform, and all six on the
rise itself were positive for prehistoric cultural
materials (see Table 4.1). The site size is defined
entirely by the small landform, being 35 m northsouth by 25 m east-west. The assemblage of 54
artifacts equates to an artifact density of 9.0 per
positive test. The assemblage consists of 7 small
nonhuman bone fragments, 1 untypeable arrow
point fragment (Figure 4.45), and 46 pieces of
lithic debitage. Also recovered were 2 pieces of

of silicified wood, which may or may not be cultural. The distribution of the artifacts displays a
gradual increase in total numbers to 80 cm and
152

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
a decrease below that. Thirty-eight percent of the
assemblage was recovered at 60–80 cm. Given its
setting and the materials recovered, the site likely
served as a short-term campsite or resource procurement location. The arrow point implies that
at least part of the occupation occurred during
the Caddo or perhaps late Woodland periods, but
the lack of other diagnostic items prevents a firm
chronological assessment.
The small arrow point fragment manufactured of reddish-brown chert could not be
typed but has similarities to both Catahoula
and Friley. The debitage consists of 29 complete
small flakes, 3 proximal flake fragments, 2
distal flake fragments, 7 pieces of shatter, and
5 other small pieces that are unidentifiable
flake fragments. The dominance of whole small
flakes suggests that tool finishing, retouching,
or maintenance were important activities conducted at the site. Lithic materials include local
and nonlocal resources with a predominance of
local types. Local materials include red, brown,
tan, yellow, tannish-yellow, reddish-brown,
and reddish-gray cherts (n = 17); Ogallala
chert (n = 2) and quartzite (n = 3); hematite
(n = 3); petrified wood (n = 4); and ferruginous
sandstone (n = 1). Possible local sources are
other quartzites (n = 4), banded chert (n = 1),
red-white chert (n = 1), and pink chert (n = 1).
Nonlocal and probable nonlocal stone materials
include gray chert (n = 4), black chert (n = 1),
and white chert or novaculite (n = 2). There are 4
pieces of burned chert for which origin could not
be determined. The black and gray chert could
be derived from either the Big Fork Formation
in southeastern Oklahoma or from gravel bars
along the Red River (Perttula 1984). White chert
or novaculite pieces could represent material
from the Ozarks, Ouachitas, or Edwards Plateau
regions (Banks 1984, 1990).
Soils are mapped as Laneville loam, frequently flooded (Griffith 2000). However, the
deposits on this small rise are deep, very sandy,
and very well drained, though probably flooded
during periods of high water. All shovel tests on
the rise were excavated to at least 100 cm, and
none encountered an argillic horizon. Shovel
tests on the lower floodplain surrounding the
landform did encounter sediments that are undoubtedly Laneville loam based on their loamy,
silty, and very consolidated character. The average shovel test depth on the rise was 102 cm
with the maximum depth reached being 105 cm.

All six tests on the rise revealed the same basic
stratigraphic sequence. The upper 10–15 cm
was moderately consolidated dark brown sandy
loam with occasional ironstone gravels. From
15 to about 100 cm, the deposits were loosely
consolidated silty granular sand with occasional
gravels. Below 100 cm, the deposit became loosely consolidated lighter-colored fine-grained sand.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK704 is a small lithic scatter on
an isolated knoll on the Cherokee Bayou floodplain. The location within a frequently flooded
landscape suggests occupations were of short
duration and perhaps related to exploitation of
the surrounding bottomlands. It is one of five
sites spread along the length of the floodplain
east-west that could have the capacity to yield
useful information about Native American use of
the floodplain. No instances of archeological remains within stratified Holocene alluvium were
observed in the shovel tests, but it is possible
that such contexts could be present, particularly
on the lower margins of the landform. If so, it
may be comparatively easy to isolate components in some areas. The single arrow point
indicates that it has a Caddo or late Woodland
component, and thus it may have the potential
to contribute to a better understanding of Caddo
settlement systems, particularly that associated
with the Early Caddo ceremonial center at the
Hudnall-Pirtle site on the Sabine River not far
to the northeast. Site 41RK704 is considered
potentially eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places under Criterion D,
pending test excavations to more fully gauge its
age, content, and integrity.
Site 41RK705
Description
Site 41RK705 is a prehistoric lithic scatter at an elevation of 310 ft atop what is left
of an impressive interfluve overlooking the
Cherokee Bayou floodplain and the small Watt
Creek tributary (Figure 4.46). The interfluve
is oriented northwest-southeast and has been
considerably modified on the east side by
mechanical scraping and excavation for a gas
pipeline and on the west side by mechanical
scraping and sloping for State Highway 149.

What remains is a narrow ridge, essentially
the central spine of the original interfluve, for
a distance of about 220 m from its farthest
northwest point to its south end. The ridge top
is vegetated with loblolly pines and deciduous
hardwoods such as oaks. Disturbances are
considerable. Most significant are modifications
from construction of State Highway 149 on the
west side and quarrying that removed much of
the east side for the gas pipeline, leaving a cliff
face that varies in height from 1–2 m on the
south end to about 7–8 m on the north. At least

two-thirds of the interfluve has been removed.
Other disturbances include active erosion and
slumping on the east side cliff face, cattle trampling, and animal burrowing on the remaining
intact central portion.
Thirteen shovel tests were excavated on
the remaining landform surface to define a site
measuring 80 m northwest-southeast by 35 m
southwest-northeast. Nine shovel tests were
positive (see Table 4.1). The recovered assemblage consists of 30 artifacts, equating to an
artifact density of 3.3 per positive test. Cultural

materials were distributed generally equitably through the deposits to a depth of 80 cm:
0–20 cm (n = 9), 20–40 cm (n = 7), 40–60 cm
(n = 10), 60–80 cm (n = 4). Recovered artifacts
consist of 1 reworked untyped arrow point
(Figure 4.47), 15 whole small flakes, 3 distal
flake fragments, 1 piece of bipolar shatter, 9
other pieces of shatter, and 1 small piece of firecracked ferruginous sandstone (discarded). The
small reworked arrow point has a basal shape
reminiscent of a Friley point; the blade expands
upward like a Friley but has been resharpened
on both lateral edges. Lithic raw materials include mainly locally available types: Ogallala
chert (n = 4); brown, brownish-yellow, brownish-red, and translucent brown cherts (n = 9);
creamy brown chert (n = 1); various quartzites
(n = 5); petrified wood (n = 2); hematite (n = 2);
and ferruginous sandstone (n = 3). Probable
nonlocal materials include gray chert (n = 3)
and black chert (n = 1). The arrow point implies

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK705 is a sparse upland lithic
scatter that has been substantially disturbed by
a number of natural and mechanical processes.
Construction of State Highway 149 and quarrying
to provide a corridor for an adjacent gas pipeline
are the most significant disturbances. Some of
the artifacts relate to use during the Caddo or
late Woodland periods, but it is possible that the
site was used at other times as well. Because
of disturbance and the setting, it appears that
discrete cultural components are not isolable in
the remaining archeological deposit. As such, the
site is considered to have little potential to provide
important information concerning area prehistory,
and it is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No additional
archeological work is recommended.

of 260–270 ft (Figure 4.48). Aerial imagery indicates that, prior to 2005, this entire area was
in deciduous woods after which it was logged
and cleared to create the present open pasture.
The site is vegetated in grasses except along
a narrow drainage that is still overgrown in
secondary-growth hardwoods. The site surface
slopes down gently to the west along a series of
sandy erosional benches above a small intermittent stream flowing northwest from the valley
wall. Disturbances include animal burrowing
and erosion, in addition to clearing for logging.
Eight shovel tests were excavated to define
a lithic scatter measuring 130 m north-south by
40 m east-west. Five tests contained five prehistoric lithic artifacts for a density of 1.0 item per
positive test (see Table 4.1). The artifacts consist
of two complete flakes, one proximal flake fragment, one medial flake fragment, and one piece
of shatter. One is red chert, one is translucent
red chert, one is petrified wood, one is Ogallala

The deposits at 41RK705 are mapped as
Darco loamy fine sand, which typically occur
on upland interfluves with gentle to moderate
slopes (Griffith 2000:39). The average shovel
test depth at the site was 87 cm with a range of
55–105 cm. The typical sediment sequence was
present in Shovel Test DB496: the upper 10 cm
was very loose light brown fine-grained sand, at
10–100 cm was light grayish-brown silty sand
with a few small ironstone gravels and mottled

chert, and one is gray quartzite. All are locally
available lithic resources. They were distributed
evenly at depths between 0 and 100 cm. The
sparse assemblage reflects only tool maintenance
or tool manufacture, with the lack of diagnostic
artifacts preventing a chronological assessment.
Soils are mapped as Tenaha loamy fine
sand (Griffith 2000). These soils are present on
well-drained upland landforms. The average
shovel test depth was 94 cm, and the argillic
horizon was encountered in four tests at depths
of 80–100 cm, averaging 87 cm. Shovel tests

revealed a brown to dark brownish-gray consolidated to moderately consolidated silty fine sand
in the upper 25 cm with lower zones of loose to
slightly consolidated yellow or pale yellow fine
sand and a few ironstone gravels. The argillic
horizon consists of pale orange sandy clay with
a few ironstone gravels.

logging and other factors. The scarceness of
artifacts, upland setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable organic
materials indicate that isolating components
and dating them would be problematic, if not
impossible. With these limitations, 41RK706
is judged not to contain important information about Native American use of the project
area and is considered ineligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places.
No further archeological investigation is
recommended.

Description
Site 41RK707 is a prehistoric lithic and
ceramic scatter atop and along a very low irregular-shaped series of small knolls on the south
side of the Cherokee Bayou channel (Figure
4.49). Wetlands surround the site. Meandering
small drainages flow north into Cherokee Bayou
at this point. At the north end of the site along
the main channel is a low levee created by

overbank flooding. Here, the channel meanders
slightly north and then west. Larger trees were
selectively thinned in the last 20 years or so,
and the secondary vegetation is quite dense over
most of the area. Larger sections along Cherokee
Bayou have been thinned recently, including the
north end of the site. Vegetation is typical of the
floodplain, including cypress trees. A narrow
maintained ATV track is along the levee and
higher ground of the channel. Other disturbances include periodic inundation, erosion, tree
throws, and animal burrowing.
Eleven shovel tests were excavated to define
a site area 75 m north-south by 35 m east-west.
Three shovel tests were positive and contained
five artifacts recovered between 40 and 80 cm for
a density of 1.7 items per positive test (see Table
4.1): two plain sherds (Figure 4.50a), one bipolar
core fragment of Ogallala chert, one distal flake
fragment of hematite, and one ground stone tool
fragment that may be a portion of a hematite
axe bit (Figure 4.50b). Also recovered was one
piece of burned clay, but it may or may not be
cultural. The sherds have clayey pastes and are
consistent with Caddo wares but are otherwise
not diagnostic. The bipolar core retains cortex

on much of its surface. The small hematite axe
bit fragment has one exterior face remnant with
polish and two grinding facets.
Soils are mapped as Bienville loamy fine
sand and Laneville loam, frequently flooded
(Griffith 2000). The average shovel test depth
was 71 cm. The argillic horizon was encountered
in three tests at 20, 60, and 75 cm, suggesting
that the contact between the B horizon and overlying silts and sands is uneven, perhaps due to
erosion and channeling on the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain. The deposits consisted of 10–15 cm
of brown to dark brown silty loam above lighter
brown to yellowish-brown sandy loam.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK707 is a small lithic and ceramic
scatter on a series of small knolls on the south
side of Cherokee Bayou. The location within a
frequently flooded landscape suggests occupations were of short duration and perhaps related
to exploitation of the surrounding bottomlands.
It is one of five sites spread along the length of
the floodplain east-west that could have the capacity to yield useful information about Native
American use of the floodplain. No instances of
archeological remains within stratified Holocene
alluvium were observed in the shovel tests, but
it is possible that such contexts could be present,
particularly on the lower margins of some of
the knolls. If so, it may be comparatively easy
to isolate components in some areas. The two
sherds indicates that it has a Caddo component,
and thus it appears to have the potential to
contribute to a better understanding of Caddo
settlement systems, particularly that associated
with the Early Caddo ceremonial center at the
Hudnall-Pirtle site on the Sabine River not far
to the northeast. Site 41RK707 is considered
potentially eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places under Criterion D,
pending test excavations to more fully gauge its
age, content, and integrity.

The site is covered with dense secondary growth
composed of deciduous saplings, greenbriers,
vines, and scattered loblolly pines. The landform
slopes steeply eastward to the floor of the drainage, which is entrenched with steep cut banks.
Gas pipeline installation clipped the south end
of the site, and erosion and animal burrowing
were observed on portions of it.
Six shovel tests were excavated on and
around the site, and only two contained prehistoric cultural materials for a density is 1.0
artifact per positive shovel (see Table 4.1). The
site area is 20 m northwest-southeast by 15 m

southwest-northeast. The recovered assemblage
consists of one complete Ogallala quartzite
flake and one brown quartzite proximal flake
fragment found at depths of 40–80 cm. Very
little can be stated regarding the nature of the
occupation(s) that created the site.
Soils are mapped as Tenaha loamy fine
sand (Griffith 2000). The average depth of the
tests was 65 cm. The argillic horizon was encountered in five tests between 50 and 80 cm,
for an average depth of 62 cm. Sandy surface
deposits consist of 10–15 cm of brown to dark
brown silty sand with few ironstone gravels

the tests was 58 cm. The argillic horizon was
encountered in all seven shovel tests between
28 and 86 cm, averaging 54 cm. Variation in
the depth of the argillic horizon is attributable
to sloping topography and proximity to the
drainages. The sandy surface sediments consist
of 10–15 cm of brown to dark brown silty sand
with few ironstone gravels over 50–80 cm of tan
silty fine sands with ironstone gravels.

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK708 is a very sparse upland lithic
scatter. The assemblage suggests only shortterm use. The scarceness of artifacts, upland
setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable organic materials indicate that
isolating components and dating them would
be problematic, if not impossible. With these
limitations, 41RK708 is judged not to contain
important information about Native American
use of the project area and is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places. No further archeological investigation is
recommended.

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK709 is a very sparse upland lithic
scatter. The assemblage suggests only shortterm use. The scarceness of artifacts, upland
setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable organic materials indicate that
isolating components and dating them would
be problematic, if not impossible. With these
limitations, 41RK709 is judged not to contain
important information about Native American
use of the project area and is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places. No further archeological investigation is
recommended.

Site 41RK709
Description
Site 41RK709, at an elevation of 300–320 ft,
is a diffuse lithic scatter in a backslope and
footslope setting on an interfluve above a small
side drainage on the west end of a larger northwest-trending drainage to the north and east
(Figure 4.52). The site is directly opposite the
drainage from 41RK708. The slopes and cut
banks of the drainage are steep and incised. The
site is vegetated in loblolly pines and deciduous
trees with areas of open to dense understory.
Observed disturbances include animal burrowing and active erosion. Installation of a nearby
gas pipeline may have impacted the south edge
of the site.
Seven shovel tests were excavated to define
a small site measuring 35 m northwest-southeast by 10 m southwest-northeast (see Table
4.1). Two tests yielded a piece of brownish-yellow
chert shatter, a complete red chert flake, and a
possible ground stone tool fragment, for an artifact density of 1.5 items per positive test. The
possible ground stone is a piece of ferruginous
sandstone that appears to have remnant percussion flaking on two edges. The piece of shatter
and possible tool fragment are from 0–20 and
20–40 cm. The flake was recovered at 40–60 cm.
Very little can be stated regarding the nature of
the occupation(s) that created the site.
Soils are mapped as Tenaha loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000:158–159). The average depth of

Site 41RK710
Description
Site 41RK710 is a historic farmstead situated at an elevation of 255 ft in an upland pasture
on the south side of County Road 2195 (Figure
4.53). All that remains of the site is a thick stand
of tall trees, a concrete-lined well, and a thin
scatter of twentieth-century artifacts. Mixed
deciduous woodlands to the north, southwest,
and west are along the slopes of a small stream
valley that trends southeast to northwest.
Limited erosion and animal burrowing are the
most active disturbance agents, and construction
of a nearby gas well pad may have disturbed the
east end of the site. Improvements are evident
at this location on the 1930s aerial photographs
but not the 1960 aerial.
The only feature identified is a water well
manufactured of stacked precast concrete pipe
or culvert sections. Five of the seven shovel
tests excavated revealed artifacts scattered
around the well and a large tree over an area of
25 m north-south by 70 m east-west (see Table
4.1). The recovered assemblage consists of 22
artifacts: 5 sherds of clear and brown container

glass, 1 piece of aqua glass shatter, 4 pieces of
window glass, 5 wire nails, 6 other pieces of
metal, and 1 unidentified brick fragment. The
artifact density is 4.4 per positive test. Of these
artifacts, 9 were recovered at 0–20 cm, 12 at
20–40 cm, and 1 at 40–60 cm. The wire nails
indicate occupation after the early 1890s (Wells
1998:87), while the remainder of the assemblage
could date to either the nineteenth or twentieth
century and thus is not diagnostic.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine
sand (Griffith 2000). The argillic horizon was
encountered between 46 and 70 cm in all seven
shovel tests. The average depth of the argillic
horizon, as well as the average shovel test depth,
was 58 cm.

Site 41RK710 (Resource 17) is on Tract R026048, which encompasses 258.34 acres out of the
northeast quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas
O’Bar Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is on the
north edge of the tract, just east of its center, on
the south side of County Road 2195. For a history
of land ownership until 1912, see 41RK698.
In 1912, Willis K. Menefee and R. L.
McInnis sold the 25.37-acre parcel on which
41RK710 is situated, known as Tract No. 11, and
an adjoining 25.3-acre parcel (Tract No. 10) to
Will F. Welch for $11,073.40 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 50:609). That year, Welch owned a total
of 367 acres out of the O’Bar Survey, which were

Jennings (1887–1937), and they lived with their
three sons—J. W. or Walter, Robert E., and Peggy
Jim—on the farm they owned along Chrystal
Farms Road in 1930 (Franklin 2003b; Rusk
County, Deed Record 370:17; U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1930b). That
year, the Bealls owned 1,608 acres out of the
O’Bar Survey and another nearby 42 acres (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). Improvements

property (Tobin International 1930).

appraised at $10,935 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records). Welch also purchased the 25.3acre Tract No. 8 and the 25-acre Tract No. 9 in
the 1920s for a total of $518.24 (Rusk County,
Deed Records 105:182, 127:627, 141:343). In
1920, Welch and his wife, Lola Bell, both native
Mississippians, lived on the farm they owned
along Chrystal Farms Road with their five sons
(U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the
Census 1920). They had whittled their holdings
out of the O’Bar Survey to 110 acres appraised
at $770 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1928, the Welches sold the parcel containing 41RK710 to Emmett F. Beall (1883–1958)
162

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
In September 1933, Emmett F. and Mary
Jennings Beall sold the land to Buddie L.
Haygood for $2,500 (Rusk County, Deed Record
241:528). Haygood had been renting property
along Chrystal Farms Road in 1930 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records; U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1930b).
In October 1934, Buddie L. and Lillian
Irene Haygood sold the land back to Beall for
$2,000, and Beall’s heirs sold their interest in
the land to him for $658 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 258:304, 344:148, 370:17). Beall married
his second wife, Maye, sometime after his first
wife’s 1937 death but before 1939 when they
divorced (Rusk County, Deed Record 333:575).
Improvements were in the location of 41RK710
in 1939, with crop and pasture land and stands
of trees nearby, but it is unclear which of their
several parcels out of the O’Bar Survey may
have served as their homestead (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records; U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939). Although divorced,
the couple lived together on Chrystal Farms
Road in 1940, along with his youngest son Robert
(U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the
Census 1940).
In 1940, Emmett F. Beall and his surviving
heirs sold the land to Malcolm L. Ross for $1,125
(Rusk County, Deed Records 344:149–151).
No improvements were extant in the location of 41RK710 by 1960 (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1960). The Rosses owned
the land until 1988, when they conveyed it to
the Ward Rosson Land Company, which retains
ownership (Rusk County, Appraisal District
Records 2013).

associations for part of its history, all of which
indicate that it is a poor candidate for contributing important archeological information about
the history of the area. No further archeological
investigation is recommended.
Site 41RK711
Description
Site 41RK711 is a multicomponent prehistoric lithic scatter and historic farmstead
situated at an elevation of 310 ft near the end
of a long narrow interfluve at a point that overlooks the Cherokee Bayou floodplain (Figure
4.54). Narrow stream valleys east and west of
the site trend northward, opening onto a large
backswamp area at the foot of the valley wall
and the bayou floodplain beyond. The site is in
a mechanically cleared area surrounded by replanted pine forest. Areas of loblolly pines have
a dense understory dominated by greenbriers,
poison ivy, and similar vegetation. There are two
large older oak trees on the site. A two-track road
traverses the ridge spine, passing by the east
edge of the site. It continues down the nose of
the interfluve. In addition to the two-track road,
disturbance includes activities associated with
logging, vegetation clearing, pine replanting,
animal burrowing, and erosion. Historic aerial
photographs dating to the 1930s appear to show
improvements here, but the 1960 aerial does not.
Thirteen of 21 shovel tests yielded an
assemblage of 46 historic and 6 prehistoric
artifacts for densities of 3.8 and 2.5 items
per positive test respectively (see Table 4.1).
The site area based on positive tests is 45 m
north-south by 45 m east-west. The historic
assemblage consists of 8 pieces of container
glass (clear, brown, and aqua or green), 1 piece
of window glass, 2 pieces of melted or shattered
clear glass, 1 annular-decorated whiteware and
2 plain whiteware sherds, 3 stoneware sherds,
6 cut nails, 1 specialized nail, 4 other pieces of
metal (not including a number of small fragments found in Shovel Test JD845 that were
not collected), 1 celluloid button, 12 unidentified
brick fragments, and 5 pieces of nonhuman
faunal material (Figure 4.55). Not included in
this list are 7 pieces of possible mortar and a
single sandstone fragment. Some of these items
suggest nineteenth-century occupation. These
include the cut nails, which appear to represent

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK710 is a farmstead associated with
Will F. and Lola Bell Welch from 1912 until 1928,
Emmett F. Beall and his family from 1928 until
1940, and Malcolm L. and Josie Ross subsequently. It is likely that tenants occupied the land, especially after 1928. The site is considered ineligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places because it dates entirely to the twentieth
century, has remains relating to occupation until
near mid-century, has limited features that could
provide information on site layout, and probably
was occupied by tenants and thus is of unknown

at least two different sizes, Type 8 (1823–1891)
and Type 10 (1891–1893), based on nail head
characteristics (Wells 1998:92). Two pieces of
salt-glazed stoneware also may be early. The
types of vessels represented are indeterminate,
but one sherd has glaze on its inner and outer
surfaces, and the other has glaze on the outer
surface and partial glaze on the inner surface.
Ramsay (1939:139–140) indicates that saltglazed wares were popular in the nineteenth
century but became less abundant after the
Civil War period (Stelle 2001:11). One whiteware sherd is from an annular-banded mug or
cup with robin’s egg blue body and alternat-

ing white and green bands. Such wares date
between 1840 and 1900 in the United States
(Ramsay 1939:149). The celluloid button could
date to the very late nineteenth century but is
more likely of twentieth-century age (Spude
2014). The remainder of the assemblage could
date to either the nineteenth or twentieth century and thus is not diagnostic.
The prehistoric assemblage contains three
complete flakes (one of petrified wood and two of
gray quartzite) and two medial flake fragments
of red chert and gray quartzite, recovered from
depths between 60 and 110 cm. An additional artifact that may be attributable to the prehistoric

of the Interior, Census Office 1850c). The family
lived in Rusk County by 1843 (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records). By 1850, the widowed
Sophia Fellers was living on 500 acres out of
the O’Bar Survey with three of her sons, who
operated the farm, and three of her daughters.
Marion G. Fellers lived on an adjoining 500-acre
parcel out of the O’Bar Survey that year with his
wife Nancy J. Fellers (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records; U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1850c).
In 1851, the Fellers conveyed their
1,000 acres out of the O’Bar Survey to Hinton
Vinson (Rusk County, Deed Record E:212).
Vinson married Pheraby Allen in North Carolina
in 1823 (FamilySearch 2013a). The Vinsons
were living in Madison County, Tennessee, in
1850 with their seven children, who included
sons John and Addison (U.S. Department of the
Interior, Census Office 1850b). In the 1850s,
the Vinsons lived on their land out of the O’Bar
Survey. Vinson may have conveyed his assets
to his wife, as she was taxed for land, livestock,
and slaves, and he acted as her agent from 1855
until at least 1867. In about 1862, the Vinsons
acquired land out of the nearby Walling Survey
that was more heavily improved than their
holdings in the O’Bar Survey, and a Vinson
farmstead was along the east side of the road

Site History
Site 41RK711 is on Tract R026-008, which
encompasses 266.7 acres out of the northwest
quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas O’Bar
Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is in the south
half of the tract, near its east edge.
Pennsylvania-born Henry G. Fellers (1762–
1847) married his South Carolinian wife
Sophia (1792–1850?) in 1814. They were living
in Limestone County, Alabama, in 1825, and
their first seven children—R. G., Jane, Marion,
John G., Emeline, and twins Washington G. and
Lafayette G.—were born in that state between
the 1810s and 1830s (Slaughter 2013; U.S.
Department of the Interior, Census Office 1850c).

youngest daughter was born (U.S. Department

purchased the O’Bar Survey in its entirety for
$3,728.66 through a sheriff’s deed (Rusk County,
Deed Records W:604, V:317). Flanagan held many
properties in Rusk County and did not occupy
this land (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
S. H. and V. B. Vernon owned the 212-acre
parcel on which 41RK711 is situated by 1892,
when they sold the land to Ansel Walter Capps
for $400 (Rusk County, Deed Record 42:353).
In 1895, the Askew heirs sold their interests
in the land to Capps for $187.50 (Rusk County,
43:575). In 1900, Capps and his wife, Syntha
Ledbetter Capps, were farming on the land with
four of their children and two boarders (Tricia
the Spirit Chaser 2012a; U.S. Department of
the Interior, Census Office 1900a). The property gradually increased in value, from $300
in 1892 to $530 in 1900. By 1905, Capps had
acquired additional lands out of the O’Bar
Survey, and his total acreage was appraised at
$1,100, along with 100 acres out of the Walling
Survey valued at $250. His livestock holdings
also increased, and by 1905 he had 10 equine,
20 bovine, 10 swine, 2 wagons, $50 in tools,
and an $800 steam engine (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records). After his wife’s 1905
death, Capps married Susan Amie Welch, and
they lived on the farm with three children until
1918, when he sold the land to Robert Owen
Kuykendall for $2,250 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 99:319; Tricia the Spirit Chaser 2012b;
U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor,
Bureau of the Census 1910). For the history of
the land after 1918, see 41RK696.
Improvements may have been in the
location of 41RK711 in the 1930s, but by
1960, it appears to have been pasture land
(Tobin International 1930; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939, 1960).

between Camden and Henderson, to the west of
the current project area, in 1863 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records; Von Rosenberg 1863).
They held between 8 and 14 slaves from 1851
until 1864. In 1860, for example, they held 14
slaves—4 adult males aged 24 to 50, 3 adult
females aged 28 to 55, and 7 children aged 12
and under—who resided in four slave houses
on the property (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records; U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1860b). They usually had 4 equine and 30
bovine, although just before the Civil War they
had as many as 50 and 75 bovine. The Vinsons
were likely both deceased by 1869 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). Upon her death,
Pheraby Vinson willed the 1,000 acres to their
son John B. Vinson (Rusk County, Deed Record
U:458). John B. Vinson, born in North Carolina,
farmed in Rusk County with his wife, Laura A.
Keener, a native of Alabama. In 1870, her 8-yearold son and their infant daughter lived with
them. Vinson owned $1,200 in real estate and
another $1,000 in personal wealth that year (U.S.
Department of the Interior, Census Office 1870).
In 1872, Vinson conveyed 212 acres out of
the property to his brother, Addison H. Vinson
(Rusk County, Deed Record U:458). Vinson,
born in Tennessee, farmed in Rusk County with
his wife, Martha, a native of Georgia, and their
1-year-old Texas-born son in 1870. John Rice, a
20-year-old black farm laborer born in Mexico,
and James Blakely, a 19-year-old Georgia native
who attended school, also lived with the family
that year. Vinson owned $800 in real estate and
another $800 in personal wealth in 1870 (U.S.
Department of the Interior, Census Office 1870).
Vinson also held land out of the nearby Walling
Survey in the 1870s that was more heavily improved than his land out of the O’Bar Survey
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). By 1880,
the family resided in Van Zandt County (U.S.
Department of the Interior, Census Office 1880c).
In 1878, the Vinsons conveyed the land
to John T. Askew for $500 (Rusk County, Deed
Records Z:167, 28:633). Askew had three equine,
six bovine, four swine, and a wagon in 1879
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). By
1880, the 38-year-old Georgia native was farming as a single man (U.S. Department of the
Interior, Census Office 1880a).
Landowners in the O’Bar Survey must
have defaulted on their loans or their taxes in
the 1870s, when James Winwright Flanagan

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK711 is on land associated with
Henry and Sophia Fellers (1843?–1851), several
members of the Vinson family (1851–1878), John
T. Askew (1870s), James Winwright Flanagan
(1870s–?), S. H. and V. B. Vernon (?–1892), and
the Ansel Walter Capps family (1892–1918). It
is uncertain which of these owners the archeological remains relate to, or if the remains reflect
use by owners or tenants, since some owners
are known to have lived elsewhere. The historic

for National Register listing because its associations are unknown and it lacks structural
remains or other cultural features that could
provide information on site layout. No further

The prehistoric component at 41RK711
is a very sparse upland lithic scatter. The assemblage suggests only short-term use. The

east corner of a hay pasture and adjacent to the
southeast corner of a gas well pad that occupies
most of the interfluve nose. A small drainage
borders the east edge of the site. The site surface
has two erosional swales where runoff from uplands to the south flow into the drainage. These
swales limited where shovel tests were placed to
define the site boundary. Woods scattered along
the drainage are deciduous trees like oak, elm,
and hackberry with occasional loblolly pines. A
small dense stand of trees is on the site atop the
knoll. Disturbances include animal burrowing,
erosion and channeling, clearing to create the
pasture, and cattle trampling. Construction of
the gas well pad on the north side also may have
impacted part of the site.
Fourteen shovel tests were excavated
to define a site area measuring 20 m northwest-southeast by 55 m southwest-northeast.
Two tests contained two complete flakes of
Ogallala chert and one piece of red chert shatter (see Table 4.1), for an artifact density of
1.5 per positive test. The piece of shatter was
from a depth of 20–40 cm, and the two flakes
came from 40–80 cm. Very little can be stated
regarding the nature of the occupation(s) that
created the site.
Soils are mapped as Latex very fine sandy
loam, which are common on upland divides
(Griffith 2000). Shovel test depth varied between 35 and 100 cm and averaged 75 cm.
The argillic horizon was encountered in seven
shovel tests between 35 and 90 cm. Overlying
the argillic horizon is strong brown to yellowish-brown and pale orangish-brown loamy sand
with abundant ironstone gravels increasing
with depth.

Description
Site 41RK713 is a diffuse prehistoric lithic
scatter and probable historic farmstead at elevations of 290–300 ft at the north end of an upland
interfluve and pasture (Figure 4.57). There is
a small narrow drainage on the west side and
an occupied residence on the east side. A mix of
elm, oak, and hackberry trees grow along the
small stream. Observed disturbances include
animal burrowing, erosion and channeling,
clearing to create the pasture, cattle trampling,
and construction of a gas well pad on the north
side, which removed much of the north end of
the interfluve and created a 2–3-m-high sloped
cut face along the south edge of the well pad.
On the north edge of the interfluve is a small
east-flowing drainage that was slightly diverted
by creation of the well pad. None of the historic
aerial photographs show buildings or structures
in this location. No surface indications of historic
structures were observed, with the possible exception of a large hematite cobble that could be
a displaced footing stone.
Twenty-four shovel tests were excavated
across the interfluve surface defining an overall
scatter of prehistoric and historic artifacts measuring 195 m north by 70 m south. Seven tests
were positive for prehistoric lithic artifacts and
historic materials (see Table 4.1). Three tests
contained prehistoric materials, providing an
artifact density of 1.3 per positive test, and four
other tests contained historic artifacts, for a
density of 5.3 items per positive test. The prehistoric assemblage consists of a poll fragment
of a hematite axe with bending breaks (Figure
4.58), a complete flake of Ogallala chert, a piece
of red chert shatter, and a medial fragment of
a hematite flake. The hematite artifacts were
found at 0–20 cm, and the chert artifacts were
at 40–60 cm. The axe poll fragment has three
surfaces exhibiting grinding, polish, and battering from the manufacture process, but the
breaks are from tool use. The lithic debitage
was confined to two shovel tests on the far north
end of the site behind the cut face of the well
pad. The axe poll fragment is from the far south
edge of the site. Little can be said about use
of the site based on these few specimens. The
historic artifacts were recovered at the south
end of the site. They consist of two pieces of

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK712 is a very sparse upland lithic
scatter. The assemblage suggests only shortterm use. The scarceness of artifacts, upland
setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable organic materials indicate that
isolating components and dating them would
be problematic, if not impossible. With these
limitations, 41RK712 is judged not to contain
important information about Native American
use of the project area and is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places. No further archeological investigation is
recommended.

The property may have been occupied by
tenants in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century when it was owned by James and
Margaret Langhorne, James Winright Flanagan,
John Phelps and sons Ashton and William A.
Phelps, James M. Oden, Eliza Kempner, John M.

R. L. McInnis, since all of these owners lived elsewhere (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).

Site History
Site 41RK713 is on Tract R026-049, which,
combined with Tract R026-049.2 to the west,
encompasses 222.5 acres out of the southeast
quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas O’Bar
Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is in the north
half of the tract, south of County Road 2199.

the latter part of the nineteenth century into the
early twentieth century. Improvements relating
to this farmstead were gone by the 1930s. It
probably was occupied by tenants under one or
more of a succession of owners. It is considered
ineligible for National Register listing because
its associations are unknown and because it has
no cultural features that could provide information on site layout. No further archeological
investigation is recommended.
The prehistoric component at 41RK713 is a

(Figure 4.59). Elm, oak, and hackberry trees
grow along the slopes of the small drainage, but
otherwise there are only broadly scattered trees
within a large pasture. Disturbances include
land clearing, animal burrowing, erosion along
the drainage, and cattle trampling.

pipelines, erosion, infilling, and animal burrowing
all have impacted the integrity of the old roadway.
The road was in use in the 1930s, judging from
aerial photographs, but was out of service by the
time the 1958 USGS map was made.
Twenty-three shovel tests were excavated along the recorded segment of 41RK715;
41RK716 was found on the north side of the road
bed and is described below. Other than the tests
at 41RK716, only 2 of the 23 shovel tests were
positive for cultural materials, although the
artifacts bear no direct relationship to the road
or any known archeological site and are considered isolated finds. Shovel Test CK150 yielded
two small pieces of oxidized metal at 0–20 cm
within the right-of-way of a gas pipeline. Shovel
Test TN001 had a 30-cm-diameter corroded
flat metal disk at 20–40 cm that appears to be
related to some type of agricultural equipment.
These artifacts were not collected.
The old road crosses several soil types, including Sawlit-Sawtown complex, Woodtell loam,
Gallime-Alazan complex, and Latex very fine
sandy loam (Griffith 2000). The average shovel
test depth along the roadway was 64 cm, and all
but 2 tests reached the argillic horizon between
37 and 95 cm. Deposits varied from silty loams
to sandy loams.

a density of 1.0 per positive test (see Table 4.1).
The site measures 60 m north-south by 50 m eastwest. The assemblage consists of complete flakes
of chalcedony and petrified wood and a small
pressure-flaked biface fragment of nonlocal gray
chert. The two flakes were recovered at 0–20 cm,
and the biface fragment came from 40–60 cm.
Soils are mapped as Sawlit-Sawtown complex, which are common at the heads of drainages (Griffith 2000). Shovel tests varied from 48
to 93 cm in depth, averaging 66 cm; all shovel
tests reached the argillic horizon. The overlying
deposits consist of 15–25 cm of dark brown loose
fine silty sand with medium to large gravels over
loosely consolidated pale yellowish-brown very
fine-grained silty sand with small to large gravels.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK714 is a very sparse upland lithic
scatter. The recovered assemblage suggests
only short-term use. The scarceness of artifacts,
upland setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable organic materials
indicate that isolating components and dating
them would be problematic, if not impossible.
With these limitations, 41RK714 is judged
not to contain important information about
Native American use of the project area and is
considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. No further archeological investigation is recommended.

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK715 is a section of an early- to
mid-twentieth-century road. It was part of a network of roads that served a number of contemporary farmsteads between Tatum and Easton.
As an abandoned roadbed, it has no potential to
provide additional important archeological information regarding the history of the area. Hence,
41RK715 is considered ineligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places, and
no further archeological work is recommended.

Site 41RK715
Description
Site 41RK715 is a segment of a historic road.
It is oriented almost due east-west beginning at
State Highway 149 and proceeding east for a
distance of about 728 m (Figure 4.60). Along its
course, it passes through mostly maintained pastures before entering more-residential areas to the
east near Tatum. No portions of the mapped segment exhibit any indications of surface pavement.
The road appears as a cleared course through
wooded areas and as a shallow to moderately deep
(ca. 1 m) linear feature about 10 m wide. Portions
of it are now a shallow linear drainage overgrown
with trees, especially the section beginning just
east of State Highway 149. Here, drainage from
the highway is channeled into a short segment
of the old road. Cattle trampling, land clearing,

A concrete-lined well is about 12 m south of
a large oak tree. A group of irises is about 3 m
east-southeast of the well. Three large possible
sandstone footing stones are adjacent to a chinaberry tree and immediately north of a large oak
tree. One of the possible sandstone footers is directly below and leaning against the chinaberry
tree. Another is about 5 m to the west-northwest,
and the third is about 2.5 m southwest of the
second stone. Poke salad plants are growing
10–12 m northeast of the chinaberry tree.
Soils are mapped as Sawlit-Sawtown complex (Griffith 2000). Shovel test depth varied

burrowing, and previous land clearing. Overhead
electrical utility lines pass over the site to the
west, and a gas pipeline is west and southwest
about 120 m. The site, on the north side of historic
road site 41RK715, appears as a single structure
on the 1930, 1939, and 1960 aerial imagery.
Fifteen shovel tests were excavated, and
4 contained artifacts (see Table 4.1). Based on
these results and surface evidence, the site
measures 95 m north-south by 60 m east-west.
The excavated assemblage consists of 12 pieces
of container glass (clear, brown, aqua, green,
and solarized), 5 wire nails, and 4 pieces of unidentified metal, for a density of 5.2 items per
positive test. The wire nails indicate occupation
after the early 1890s (Wells 1998:87). The remainder of the assemblage could date to either

Site History

Summary and Assessment

Site 41RK716 is on Tract R026-049.2,
which, combined with Tract R026-049 to the
east, encompass 222.5 acres out of the southeast quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Thomas
O’Bar Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is in the
south half of the tract, north of a former road
(41RK715) and present-day State Highway
149. For a history of land ownership between
1903 and about 1916, see 41RK698. The land
on which 41RK716 is situated was owned by
James “Jim” Cannon Kuykendall beginning
in 1920. The farmstead evident on the historic
aerial photographs (Tobin International 1930;
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1939,

Site 41RK716 is historic tenant farmstead
that was present by 1930 and still extant as of
1960. It is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places because it
dates entirely to the twentieth century, was occupied until at least 1960, has limited features
that could provide information on site layout,
and was occupied by tenants and thus is of unknown associations, all of which indicate that it
is a poor candidate for contributing important
archeological information about the history of
the area. No further archeological investigation
is recommended.

ing the well pad. Disturbances include animal
burrowing, tree throws, erosion, and slumping.
There has been some timber thinning across the
top and slopes of the interfluve, and there must
have been some disturbance created by construction of the gas well pad and facilities.
Thirteen shovel tests were excavated, with
the 2 positive ones defining a small site area
measuring 30 m northwest-southeast by 20 m
northeast-southwest (see Table 4.1). Artifacts
from the tests consist of one complete flake each
of Ogallala chert and yellowish-brown chert,
for a density of 1.0 per positive test. One flake
was obtained at 40–60 cm and the second at
60–80 cm.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert fine sandy loam,

Description
Site 41RK717 is a diffuse lithic scatter on
an upland interfluve at elevations of 310–320 ft
facing northeast and defined by a drainage along
the east side (Figure 4.62). The site is on the nose
and summit/shoulder of the interfluve, which
slopes down to the northeast from a well pad on
the southwest edge of the site. A ditch excavated
from the east edge of the well pad extends the
length of the landform and takes drainage from
the well pad to the small stream below. The
landform is vegetated in pines and deciduous
hardwoods like oak and sweetgum. Understory
is open except along the fringes of the well pad on
the southwest and west sides of the site, where
dense pine saplings grow on the berm surround-

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
Erosion, animal burrowing, and occasional
tree falls have disturbed parts of the site. Prior
to construction of the gas well pad and access
road, the area had been thinned of timber. A gas
pipeline cuts across a portion of the site near the
county road, and that part of the site nearest
the road has been subjected to debris discard.
The only historic feature identified is the
ruinous house. The house is a small partially
collapsed board-and-batten type with a galvanized metal roof, tongue-and-groove wood
floor, and an L-shaped floor plan. Doors and
windows are gone, and the back porch roof area
is collapsed. No water well was observed near
the structure or in the vicinity away from it.
There is no indication of an external chimney or
internal fireplace. The house was manufactured
with wire nails. Roofing nails have lead caps on
the ends. Walls were constructed of 1x12-inch
lumber. The structure does not appear to be
elevated on footers and appears to be sitting on
the ground with an underpinning of 1x12- and
1x8-inch lumber. Battens are 1x5- and 1x6-inch
boards. The house is collapsed on the south and
east sides.
Thirty-two shovel tests were excavated,
defining a site area measuring 175 m northwest-southeast by 45 m east-west. Four tests
yielded 5 prehistoric artifacts for an artifact
density of 1.2 per positive test, and 9 tests contained 27 historic artifacts for a density of 3.0
items per positive test (see Table 4.1). Prehistoric
artifacts consist of 2 whole flakes, 1 medial
flake fragment, and 2 pieces of shatter; 2 are
reddish-brown chert, 1 is yellowish-brown chert,
1 is brown chert, and 1 is nonlocal gray chert.
The historic materials consist of seven
pieces of container glass (clear, green, aqua, and
solarized), four pieces of window glass, three
plain whiteware sherds and one unidentifiable
transfer-decorated whiteware sherd, one wire
nail, two grommets or eyelets, one shotgun shell,
three sanitary cans, four pieces of unidentifiable
metal, and one unidentified brick fragment. The
wire nail indicates occupation after the early
1890s (Wells 1998:87), and the sanitary cans
postdate the early 1900s (Busch 1981:97–98).
The shotgun shell base has a headstamp of
“PETERS VICTOR, Made in USA,” with a large
P around the primer. This style of shell was
produced between 1897 and 1935 (Vinson 1968).
The remainder of the assemblage could date to
either the nineteenth or twentieth century and

zon at 58 and 70 cm; all other tests were taken
to at least 100 cm. The sediments consist of
about 25 cm of cream-colored to gray, very loose
fine-grained sand with occasional small gravels
overlying more than 75 cm of pale yellow, loose
very fine-grained sand, with occasional gravels
and occasional clay clasts at the contact with
the argillic horizon. The argillic horizon is bright
orange sandy clay.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK717 is a very sparse upland lithic
scatter, which probably was used as a short-term
campsite or resource procurement location. The
scarceness of artifacts, upland setting, and lack
of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable
organic materials indicate that isolating components and dating them would be problematic, if
not impossible. With these limitations, 41RK717
is judged not to contain important information
about Native American use of the project area
and is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.
Site 41RK718
Description
Site 41RK718 is a multicomponent site
consisting of a diffuse prehistoric lithic scatter
and a historic farmstead with a ruinous standing
house and associated historic artifact scatter.
The site is on the summit and shoulder of an
upland interfluve at elevations of 310–320 ft
(Figure 4.63). To the east is a narrow stream
valley. Much of the site is in moderate woods
with pine, oak, and sweetgum trees and an
open understory of greenbriers, saplings, and
mustang grape vines. The 1930s and 1960 aerial
photographs depict a structure at this location.
The prehistoric lithic scatter is at the southern end of the site as the landform slopes southeast down to the drainage. The historic structure
sits atop the landform in the north-central part
of the site. Pedestrian survey revealed no other
associated historic features. Historic artifacts
were found in a broad scatter around the structure and extending across a gas well access road
to the north following a small gas pipeline corridor and the property fence adjacent to County
Road 2214 on the west side of the site.

thus is not diagnostic, with the solarized glass
probably dating to 1880–1920 (Lindsey 2014a).
Three prehistoric artifacts were recovered
at 0–20 cm, and one each was found at 40–60
and 60–80 cm. Almost two-thirds (n = 17) of the
historic artifacts were recovered at 20–60 cm.
Soils are mapped as Tenaha loamy fine
sands characteristic of the side slopes of upland
interfluves (Griffith 2000). Average shovel test

depth was 84 cm. The argillic horizon was encountered in 17 shovel tests at depths between
30 and 105 cm, bearing witness to the eroded
and channeled lower slopes and the less-eroded
upper portion of the landform. Average depth
to the argillic horizon was 71 cm. Overlying
sediments consist of pale cream-colored to light
grayish-yellow loosely consolidated fine-grained
sand with few ironstone gravels. The amount of

estate (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1870). The couple remained on their farm
in 1880 with three of their own children and
another child (U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1880a). In 1891, Kelly may have
leased out 200 acres of the Freeman Survey,
along with adjoining lands (Rusk County, Deed
Record C:510). The Kellys were likely living
in Wilbarger County with one of their sons by
1892, when she died (Mayo 2013). By 1900, he
lived with his son Richard in Wilbarger County
(U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1900b). When Kelly was declared incompetent
in 1908, one of his sons, Benjamin H. Kelly,
was appointed as receiver (Rusk County, Deed
Record 72:151).
In 1909 and 1910, the Kelly heirs sold a
66-acre parcel out of the Freeman Survey to
African American Green Henry for $68.75 (Rusk
County, Deed Records 72:151, 154). Henry had
married Harriet Ann in about 1904 and lived
with five children on the farm they owned along
the Hendricks Lake and Tatum Roads (U.S.
Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of
the Census 1910). Their property was appraised
at $200 annually from 1910 to 1912, and he
had two equine, three or four bovine, a few
swine, and a wagon (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records). Although its construction may
have predated their occupation, the Henrys
probably occupied the board-and-batten house
(Resource 29) at the site during their few years’
tenure on the land. Improvements were in the
location of 41RK718 in 1930, 1939, and 1960,
and the parcel had crop and pasture lands,
plus a large stand of trees during this period
(Tobin International 1930; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939, 1960).
By 1912, Henry was deceased and his
widow sold the land to Albert Olin Menefee for
$316.24 (Rusk County, Deed Record 73:1). For
the history of land ownership after 1912, see
41RK684.

Site History
Site 41RK718 (Resource 29) is on Tract
R283-003, which encompasses 66 acres out of
the north half of the 369-acre Thomas Freeman
Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is on the west
side of the tract, along the east side of County
Road 2214.
The Bastrop County Board of Land
Commissioners issued Austin resident Thomas
Freeman a first-class headright certificate in
1838. In 1849, he sold the balance of his headright to Leander Brown, who also resided in
Austin, for $30. The following year, Brown sold
his interest to Nathan Green Bagley for $35.
Obadiah Dodson was taxed on the land in 1851,
although it had not been formally located. In
1853, Brown sold the interest to Dodson’s son-inlaw, Seaborn J. Hendrick, a wealthy doctor and
plantation owner who lived nearby. A surveyor
located the 369-acre triangular-shaped Freeman
Survey in 1854, and the State of Texas patented the land to Hendrick that September (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records 1851; Rusk
County, Deed Record I:331; Texas General Land
Office 1854; U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1850a, 1860c).
In 1854, Hendrick sold the Freeman Survey
to native Tennessean Benjamin G. Kelly for
$995.50 (Rusk County, Deed Record I:332).
Kelly already owned the John Webster Survey,
which adjoined to the south, and had acquired
holdings in the Edward Simon Survey to the
east by 1860, but it remains unclear which
parcel was the location of the family farmstead
during the nineteenth century. He held one
slave in 1855, two by 1856, and six in 1860. He
typically had 2 horses, up to 20 cattle, and unspecified miscellaneous property (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records 1855, 1856, 1860, 1865).
Kelly had served in the Mexican-American
War and was a private in the Texas Cavalry’s
35th Regiment, known as Brown’s Regiment
during the Civil War (National Archives and
Records Administration 1887). By 1870, he and
his Georgia-born wife, Virginia Hill Pace, held
$2,000 in real estate and $500 in personal estate.
The Kellys had five children at the time, and a
teenage boy lived with them, Willie Kelly, who
owned $3,000 in real estate and $450 in personal

Summary and Assessment
The historic component at 41RK718 is on
land that was associated with the Benjamin and
Virginia Kelly family between 1854 and about
1892, but there is no archeological evidence of
occupation that early. The site could have been
occupied by Green and Harriet Ann Henry in
178

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
1910–1912 but more certainly was used by tenants after that, since the owners are known to
have lived elsewhere. It is considered ineligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places because it dates entirely to the twentieth century, has remains relating to occupation
until at least mid-century, and was occupied by
tenants and thus is of unknown associations for
part of its history, all of which indicate that it
is a poor candidate for contributing important
archeological information about the history of
the area. No further archeological investigation
is recommended.
The prehistoric component at 41RK718 is a
very sparse upland lithic scatter, which probably
was used as a short-term campsite or resource
procurement location. The scarceness of artifacts,
upland setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic
artifacts or dateable organic materials indicate
that isolating components and dating them would
be problematic, if not impossible. With these limitations, the prehistoric component at 41RK718

by 60 m southwest-northeast. Ten positive
shovel tests yielded an assemblage comprised of
13 lithic artifacts for a density of 1.3 items per
positive test (see Table 4.1). An eleventh test contained 2 pieces of burned nutshell that could be
cultural as well. Represented in the assemblage
are 9 whole flakes, 1 proximal flake fragment, 1
bipolar core or tested pebble, 1 probable ground
stone artifact fragment, and 1 piece of flaked angular ferruginous sandstone. All lithic materials
are local or probably local. Ten artifacts were
obtained between 60 and 100 cm. One artifact
was at 0–20 cm, and 2 were at 40–60 cm.
Soils are mapped as Tenaha loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000). Shovel testing revealed the site
has an upper 10–15 cm of light cream-colored to
light gray loose fine sand with occasional small
gravels. Below this is light brown to light yellowish-brown loose sands with cream-colored to
yellow mottles that increase with depth. These
lower sands vary in thickness with the depth
of the argillic horizon. The average shovel test
depth was 91 cm, with the depth of the argillic
horizon ranging between 40 and 100+ cm.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK719 is a very sparse upland lithic
scatter, which probably was used as a short-term
campsite or resource procurement location. The
scarceness of artifacts, upland setting, lack of
temporally diagnostic artifacts, and scarceness
of dateable organic materials indicate that
isolating components and dating them would
be problematic, if not impossible. With these
limitations, 41RK718 is judged not to contain
important information about Native American
use of the project area and is considered
ineligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places. No further archeological
investigation is recommended.

Site 41RK719
Description
Site 41RK719 is a diffuse prehistoric lithic
scatter at an elevation of 320 ft on the summit,
backslope, and shoulder of an upland interfluve
that overlooks a small drainage to the west and
a small drainage head cut area on the east side
(Figure 4.64). West of the site in the bottom of
the stream valley is a boggy area that may have
active spring seeps. The interfluve is vegetated
in pines and hardwoods like sweetgums and
oaks with a moderately open understory and
dense leaf litter. The drainage on the northeast
side is a shallow channel between the site and
a gas well pad 45 m northeast of the site. The
south drainage appears to be a typical upland
gully feature. Observed disturbances include
erosion, slumping along the upland gullies,
animal burrowing, and occasional tree falls.
There has also been limited timber thinning
across the site area some time in the past.
Thirty-two shovel tests were excavated and
define a site area of 170 m northwest-southeast

Site 41RK720
Description
Site 41RK720 is a historic site in an upland
setting at an elevation of 330 ft on the south side
of the Greater Zion Hill Baptist Church (Figure
4.65). This site is within the intersection of a gas
pipeline corridor and an aboveground electrical
utility line and has been disturbed substantially.
Adjacent recently logged areas are overgrown
179

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
with small shrubs and have piles of detritus
from timbering activities. Other disturbances
include erosion and animal burrowing. The 1930,
1939, and 1960 aerial images show at least one
structure in the vicinity.
Only four shovel tests were excavated due
to the high degree of disturbance. The site measures 50 m north-south by 20 m east-west. The
assemblage recovered from the surface and three
positive tests totals 56 artifacts and consists of

23 sherds of clear container glass, 1 brown container glass sherd, 12 pieces of window glass, 7
plain whiteware and 3 transfer-decorated whiteware sherds, 2 wire nails, 1 piece of sheet metal,
a possible plastic bead, and 6 pieces of plastic
(see Table 4.1). The artifact density is 15.3 items
per positive test. The wire nails indicate occupation after the early 1890s (Wells 1998:87), and
the plastic items certainly date to the twentieth
century (Spude 2014). The three transfer ware

sherds have portions of dark red floral designs
and may be fragments of the same vessel; they
are not otherwise identifiable and thus are not
temporally diagnostic. The remainder of the
assemblage could date to either the nineteenth
or twentieth century and also is not diagnostic.
Most of the artifacts in the shovel tests (85 percent) came from 0–20 cm; the remainder were
at 20–60 cm.
Soils are mapped as Darco loamy fine sand,
which are common on some upland landforms
(Griffith 2000). Only one shovel test reached the
argillic horizon at 96 cm. The sediments are a
yellowish-brown to pale brown loamy sand with
a few gravels. Much of the surrounding surface

adjacent to the site has loose fine-grained sand
due to disturbance from logging and abundant
animal burrowing.
Site History
Site 41RK720 is on Tract R283-001, which
encompasses 30 acres at the north edge of the
369-acre Thomas Freeman Survey (see Figure
4.8). The site is near the northeast corner of the
tract, on the west side of County Road 2210. For
the history of land ownership from 1854 until
1891, see 41RK718.
In 1891, Benjamin G. Kelly conveyed

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
Summary and Assessment

American Robert Lunsford (Rusk County, Deed
Record 83:239). Lunsford was born into slavery in 1855. By 1880, he was farming in Rusk
County and lived with his wife, Lizzie, and their
young daughter (U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1880a). By 1900, the couple lived
on the farm they owned with his young cousin
(U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1900a). The property was appraised at $100
during the nineteenth century but declined to
$75 by the early twentieth century. His livestock
holdings typically included a few bovine and
equine. Lunsford was deceased by 1904, and
his widow occupied the land until 1905 (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
It is unclear who owned or occupied the
land between about 1905 and 1916, by which
time Jim Carter (1860s–1958) had acquired
the property (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records; Rusk County, Deed Records 156:245,
666:384). Carter also owned a 40-acre parcel
out of the nearby Horton Survey (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). Carter had married
Emma Williams in 1887 (Rusk County, Marriage
Record 1:292). By 1900, the couple lived on a
farm they rented with their 6 surviving children
(U.S. Department of the Interior, Census Office
1900a). She died in about 1906, and he married
the widowed Priscilla Jackson (1860s–1959)
in 1907 (Rusk County, Deed Records 59:99,
666:384). Combined, they had 17 children living
with them, including her daughters Leatha
and Betty, on the farm. The 3 oldest sons were
laborers at a lumber mill, possibly in nearby
Flanagan, in 1910 (Rusk County, Probate
Record 68:92; U.S. Department of Commerce
and Labor 1910). In 1920, the couple resided
on their farm and had 6 children living with
them (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census 1920). In 1930, the couple had 3
grandchildren (U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of the Census 1930b). In 1940, 2 grandchildren lived with them (U.S. Department of
Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1940). The
property was fenced and in cultivation in both
1930 and 1939, with a large stand of trees
(Tobin International 1930; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939). By 1960, the land
had reverted to pasture, although improvements were still evident (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1960).

The land on which 41RK720 is situated
was associated with the Benjamin and Virginia
Kelly family between 1854 and about 1891, and
it was part of Robert and Lizzie Lunsford’s farmstead from 1891 until about 1905. It is unclear
who owned or occupied the land between about
1905 and 1916. By 1916, Jim Carter owned the
property and claimed it as part of his homestead,
living there for at least several decades. The
archeological remains probably relate to that
occupation. The site is considered ineligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places because it dates entirely to the twentieth century, has remains relating to occupation
until at least 1960, has no features that could
provide information on site layout, and has been
badly disturbed, all of which indicate that it is
a poor candidate for contributing important
archeological information about the history of
the area. No further archeological investigation
is recommended.
Site 41RK721
Description
Site 41RK721 is a multicomponent prehistoric lithic scatter and probable historic farmstead at elevations of 310–325 ft on the summit
and shoulder of two adjacent upland interfluves
separated by a shallow swale (Figure 4.66). One
interfluve is northeast of the lower interfluve.
Both areas are in open pastures on the east side of
County Road 2214, overlooking a small tributary
stream valley to the east. The wooded interfluve
slopes include a mix of occasional loblolly pines,
oaks, sweetgums, and other trees with a dense understory. Stream valley vegetation includes ferns
and other wetland species. Disturbances include
land clearing, erosion along the interfluve edges
where portions have been thinned of timber, and
animal burrowing. The 1930s aerial photographs
appear to show improvements at the site, but they
were gone by 1960.
A total of 63 shovel tests were excavated
and define a site area of 340 m north-south by
170 m east-west (north end) and 135 m (south
end). Twelve tests contained prehistoric artifacts, 7 had historic materials, and 1 test had
both (see Table 4.1). The prehistoric assemblage
has 21 items for a density of 1.7 per positive test,

and the density of historic materials is 3.5 per
positive test. The prehistoric component includes
15 flakes and flake fragments, 4 pieces of shatter,
1 possible fire-cracked rock (not collected), and
1 Friley arrow point (Figure 4.67a). The small
Friley point has been reworked on the blade and
indicates a late Woodland or Early Caddo time
period for at least a portion of the prehistoric
occupation. Three pieces of charred nutshell,
which may or may not be cultural, were found
as well. Lithic materials represented include
both local and nonlocal types. Local ones are
Ogallala chert and quartzite (n = 1, each), yellowish-brown chert (n = 3), brown chert (n = 2),
red chert (n = 1), petrified wood (n = 3), red
quartzite (n = 1), hematite (n = 1), and other
quartzite (n = 1). Nonlocal materials consist of
1 gray chert and 1 white chert.
The historic artifact assemblage consists
of 12 sherds of container glass (clear, brown,
aqua, and solarized), 1 piece of window glass,
3 whiteware sherds, 1 salt-glazed stoneware
sherd (Figure 4.67b), 1 cut nail, 1 piece of wire
or nail, a metal hook, and 8 other pieces of
metal. The cut nail suggests occupation during
the nineteenth century (Wells 1998:87), and the
stoneware sherd also may date to that century,
since manufacture of salt-glazed stoneware vessels became less common by the early twentieth
century (Stelle 2001:11). The solarized glass
likely dates to 1880–1920 (Lindsey 2014a). One
of the whiteware sherds is decorated with a light
green design that has been largely obliterated;
it is not otherwise identifiable and thus is not
temporally diagnostic. The remainder of the
assemblage could date to either the nineteenth
or twentieth century and also is not diagnostic.
Historic artifacts were recovered across an area
of ca. 40x60-m in the central portion of the site,
between the two interfluves.
Over half the prehistoric assemblage
(n = 13) was recovered at 60–105 cm, and the
remainder was found at 20–60 cm. In contrast,
all but three historic artifacts were in the upper
40 cm, with the others found at 40–60 cm.
Soils are mapped as Betis loamy fine sand,
which are present along convex upland stream
divides and side slopes (Griffith 2000). Shovel
test depth ranged from 40 to 110 cm and averaged 90 cm. Twenty-five tests reached the
argillic horizon between 40 and 100 cm, with
the average depth being 74 cm. Betis loamy
fine sand can have a deep sandy profile of up

to 200 cm, which conforms well with what was
seen in the shovel tests.
Site History
Site 41RK721 is on Tract R283-002, which
encompasses 45.987 acres out of the north half
of the 369-acre Thomas Freeman Survey (see
Figure 4.8). The site is along the west edge of the
tract, on the east side of County Road 2214. For
the history of land ownership from 1854 until
1891, see 41RK718.
It is likely that Benjamin G. Kelly conveyed
a 40-acre parcel out of the Freeman Survey
to Peter Johnson by 1892. For several years,
Johnson’s property was typically appraised at
$120, and he usually owned one or two equine,
three or four bovine, several hogs, and miscellaneous property worth $5 (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records). Peter Johnson was living
on the farm he owned in 1900 with his wife and
seven children (U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1900a). He was deceased by 1907,
and his estate was assessed for taxes on the
property, which increased in value to $180 by
1911 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
Their son Abraham had married Emmie
Johnson, but the couple separated in about
1916, and he died in 1920 or 1921 (Rusk County,
Deed Record 481:257). She occupied the land
by at least 1920, when it was appraised at $400
184

during the late Woodland or Early Caddo periods. The scarceness of artifacts, upland setting,
and scarceness or lack of temporally diagnostic
artifacts and dateable organic materials indicate that isolating components and dating them
would be problematic, if not impossible. With
these limitations, the prehistoric component
at 41RK721 is judged not to contain important information about Native American use
of the project area and is considered ineligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places. No further archeological investigation
is recommended.

(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). Six
of her children—Zeke, James, Abraham Jr.,
Lizzie Belle, John, and Earnest—lived with her
on the farm along the Tatum and Easton Road
(Rusk County, Deed Record 481:257, 262; U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
1920). Ten years later, she lived on the land with
three of her sons (U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of the Census 1930b). In the 1930s,
the property had improvements and the land
was in cultivation (Tobin International 1930;
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1939).
By 1940, only one son lived with her, but the
others lived nearby, and each farmed on land
they owned (U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of the Census 1940).
Between 1952 and 1955, several heirs
quitclaimed the land to Emmie Johnson (Rusk
County, Deed Records 482:177, 564:289, 291,
293, 295, 297). By 1960, improvements were
gone, and the land had reverted to pasture
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1960).
In 1967, Johnson and her heirs sold the land to
Malthus K. Findley for $300 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 873:49).

Site 41RK722
Description
Site 41RK722 is a multicomponent prehistoric lithic scatter and historic farmstead atop an
interfluve at elevations of 310–330 ft on the east
side of a small unnamed stream (Figure 4.68).
The site area is now in fallow pasture above
the lower slopes of the stream valley. County
Road 2210 provides the east boundary of the
site while the tree line and small valley forms
the west boundary. The south edge is the fence
between this site and the Zion Hill Cemetery.
The north edge of the site is close to an access
road for a gas well pad that has been excavated
into the lower slopes below the site and above
the small stream valley. The slopes below the site
are densely vegetated with deciduous trees and
a dense understory of yaupons and other saplings. Land clearing, cattle grazing, and animal
burrowing are the most apparent site impacts.
Slope erosion has also probably removed some
deposits, especially close to the stream west of
the site. Small push piles containing artifacts
and debris from the historic occupation are
along the pasture fence paralleling the county
road. Some of this clearing may have dislodged
a portion of the concrete casing of a well or perhaps a culvert. Historic maps and aerial imagery
indicate buildings at this location in 1930, 1938,
1939, 1958, and 1960, fronting on County Road
2219 to the east.
Thirty-three shovel tests were excavated
and define a broad diffuse scatter of artifacts
measuring 120 m north-south by 150 m eastwest. Ten shovel tests yielded an assemblage
comprised of 125 historic artifacts and 2 small
pieces of lithic debitage (see Table 4.1), with 6

Summary and Assessment
Given the presence of artifacts suggestive
of nineteenth-century occupation, the historic
component at 41RK721 may have been associated first with the Peter Johnson family from
1892 until 1907. Subsequent use by members
of the Emmie Johnson family after 1916 until
at least 1945 also is likely, although 41RK722
on the same tract probably is a better candidate
for her homestead. The historic component is
considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places, in spite of the potential presence of remains relating to nineteenth-century occupation, because it appears
to have been used until near the middle of the
twentieth century, making it extremely unlikely
that a nineteenth-century component could be
isolated for interpretation. No further archeological investigation is warranted.
The prehistoric component at 41RK721
is a very sparse upland lithic scatter, which
probably was used as a short-term campsite
or resource procurement location. The Friley
arrow point indicates that some of this use was

additional historic items recovered from the
surface and from inside the possible displaced
well casing or culvert. The prehistoric artifact
density is only 1.0 item per positive test, whereas the historic artifact density is 15.6 per test.
The lithic debris was recovered in Shovel Tests
DB806 and DB808 on the south edge of the site
and west of the historic artifact scatter. These
flakes, both of locally available brown chert,
were at depths of 0–40 cm. The historic artifacts
were distributed in a linear concentration along
the County Road 2219 fence and west about
40 m in an open stand of oaks and ornamental
trees. Cattle using the trees as shade and cover
have trampled much of this area. The historic

assemblage consists of 30 sherds of clear, brown,
green, and aqua container glass along with a
clear glass soda bottle; 1 piece of window glass;
1 piece of frosted glass; 9 pieces of melted clear
glass; 1 plain whiteware sherd; 9 wire nails; 30+

twentieth century (Busch 1981:97–98; Lindsey
2014b; Spude 2014; Wells 1998:87), with the
hair clippers being identical to sets offered for
sale in the 1908 Sears, Roebuck & Co. catalog
(Schroeder 1979:777). The clear glass soda
bottle found on the surface has labeling that
says “King Size Mission, Naturally Good in
All Flavors, bottled under authority of Mission
of California, Los Angeles Ca.” The base of
the bottle has a Knox Glass Company stamp
with a J, which was used from 1932 to 1953+.
The date appears to indicate manufacture in
August 1957. The remainder of the assemblage
could date to either the nineteenth or twentieth
century and thus is not diagnostic. Most of the
historic artifacts were at depths of 60 cm or less,
except in one shovel test (DB812) placed within
an apparent push pile atop a depression that
could be a filled well or privy. Here, artifacts
were recovered to a depth of 100 cm.
Soils are mapped as Tenaha loamy fine
sand, which are common on side slopes of upland
interfluves and characteristic of strongly sloping
lands (Griffith 2000). Shovel test depth ranged
between 22 and 100 cm and averaged 65 cm.
A total of 22 shovel tests reached the argillic
horizon at an average depth of 55 cm.

Site 41RK723
Description
Site 41RK723 is a historic farmstead at
an elevation of 340 ft in maintained pasture on
the east side of County Road 2210 at the south
end of an upland hilltop (Figure 4.69). There
are no trees on the landscape here, and soils
are very thin and eroded with ferrous bedrock
exposed on a small knoll just to the south.
Clearing of previous occupation remains,
erosion, and active animal burrowing have
significantly compromised the site condition.
A cattle feeder atop the hill to the south has
increased the traffic and erosion from cattle.
Two structures are indicated on the 1939
historical aerial image for this area but were
gone by 1960; it is unclear if improvements
are there on the 1930 aerial.
Only seven shovel tests were excavated
due to the amount of disturbance. Of these,
three were positive, yielding 12 artifacts for a
density of 3.0 items per positive test (see Table
4.1). The assemblage consists of 2 clear and 2
brown container glass sherds, 5 pieces of window
glass, 2 wire nails, and 1 piece of wire. The wire
nails indicate occupation after the early 1890s
(Wells 1998:87), but the rest of the assemblage
could date to either the nineteenth or twentieth
century and thus is not diagnostic. Based on the

Site History
Site 41RK722 is on Tract R283-002, which
encompasses 45.987 acres out of the north half of
the 369-acre Thomas Freeman Survey. The site
is along the east edge of the tract, on the west
side of County Road 2210. For a history of land
ownership, see 41RK721. Improvements were in
the location of 41RK722 by 1930, were still present by 1939, and remained extant as late as 1960
(Tobin International 1930; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939, 1960).
Summary and
Assessment
Given the twentieth-century archeological remains present, the historic component
at 41RK722 probably is the farmstead of the
Emmie Johnson family after 1916 until at least
1945. It is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places because
it dates entirely to the twentieth century, was
occupied until at least mid-century, and has

southwest quadrant of the tract, on the east side
of County Road 2210.
This land was part of the Levi Hill and
Elizabeth H. Vinson Ware plantation in the
1850s (Dockall et al. 2010:46). Ware died in 1858,
and his heirs retained the land for many years.
In 1891, their son, John Allen Ware, sold his interest in the land to his sister, Sallie Phillip Ware
Flanagan, who had married Webster Flanagan
and had four children, for $1,000 (Johnson et al.
1914:2,005; Rusk County, Deed Record 40:128;
Rusk County Depot Museum n.d.). The Flanagan
family did not live on the property (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records).
Between 1924 and 1937, the Flanagans’
oldest son, Clarence Russell Flanagan (1879–
1938), received interests in his parents’ estates,
which included land out of the Simon Survey, for

north-south by 25 m east-west. Nine artifacts
are from 0–20 cm, 2 are from 20–40 cm, and 1
is from 40–60 cm.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine
sand, which is characteristic of broad upland
interfluves (Griffith 2000). Shovel tests varied
between 21 and 96 cm in depth and averaged
69 cm. Argillic horizon depth varied similarly.
The sediments are moderately deep yellowish-brown to yellow loamy sands above brownish-yellow sandy clay.
Site History
Site 41RK723 is on Tract R735-002, which
encompasses 95.02 acres out of the north half
of the 640-acre Edward Simon Survey (Texas
General Land Office 1851). The site is in the

193:631, 304:361; Sweeney 2011). He had married Erin Lou Robinson in 1904, and they had
a son and two daughters. She died in 1912, and
he married Mary Jim Young, who had been divorced and had a son, James Shannon Strong, in
1914 (Sweeney 2011; Wiseman 2010). The family
did not live on the property (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records).
In 1928, Flanagan sold a 98.75-acre parcel
to African American Washington Elder for
$2,940 (Rusk County, Deed Record 141:477). By
1930, Washington was renting a non-farm property and lived along the Tatum and Flanagan
Road with his wife and their seven children.
He worked as a foreman in a section crew (U.S.
Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census
1930b). In 1930, Elder sold the land back to
Flanagan for cancellation of his remaining debt
(Rusk County, Deed Record 163:498).
When Flanagan died in 1938, his widow,
Mary Jim Young Flanagan, inherited the land
(Rusk County, Probate Record 31:348). The
family did not live on the property; however, improvements in the location of 41RK723 remained
extant in 1939, and the land was under cultivation (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records;
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1939). By
1960, no improvements were present, although
the land was still in cultivation (U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1960).
Flanagan passed away in 1968, and her son
and daughter-in-law, James Shannon and Lois
Windle Strong, inherited the land (Rusk County,
Probate Record 115:397; Wiseman 2010). In
1970, the Strongs conveyed the 95.02-acre parcel
on which 41RK723 is situated to Charles R. and
Virginia Walker, and they own the land (Rusk
County, Appraisal District Records 2013; Rusk
County, Deed Record 904:376).

Site 41RK724
Description
Site 41RK724 is historic Zion Hill Cemetery
adjacent to the Original Zion Hill Baptist Church.
The site is in an upland setting at an elevation of
330 ft and measures approximately 100 m northsouth by 100 m east-west (Figure 4.70). It has approximately 353 individually marked graves and
an unknown number of unmarked graves (Figure
4.71). The adjacent church dates to ca. 1970, and
as no older archeological materials were noted
there, it was not recorded as part of 41RK724.
The cemetery is still in use and maintained.
Along the western third are scattered large
oaks and other trees, while the eastern portion
is open and devoid of trees. The north edge is a
barbed wire parcel fence, and the east and south
edges are galvanized chain link fence. The west
boundary is also a barbed wire parcel fence and
gas well pipeline corridor. Observed disturbances
include erosion of the thin sandy loam deposits,
some slumping, and animal burrowing. There are
some broken and some repaired headstones and
numerous depressions that could be unmarked
graves. Some of the possible unmarked graves
are in uniform rows or row segments; no attempt
was made to count them, however. It is possible
that unmarked graves may extend beyond the
cemetery fence, especially to the north and south.
No shovel tests were excavated in or adjacent to the cemetery or the church structure.
Documentation consisted of determining the
number of graves and the earliest and latest
interments, making notes and observations on
the more-common family surnames, and photographing representative examples of the existing
headstones and grave plots. Common surnames
include Halton, Burnett, Rogers, Adams, Davis,
Greenwood, Nelson, James, Brown, Williams,
Hudson, Jacobs, Shaw, Mann, Sammons, Cox,

Summary and Assessment
Except for a two-year period, the Ware and
Flanagan families owned the land on which
41RK723 is situated from the 1850s until the
1960s, but these families did not occupy the land.
Hence, it likely was occupied by tenants. From
1928 until 1930, Washington Elder owned and
operated the property, but he did not occupy it.
The site is considered ineligible for listing in the

recent as 2011 are present.
Headstones, markers, funeral home markers, footing stones, family plot markers, and

flower vases, ceramic pitchers, and other similar
grave offerings. Piles of recently removed and
discarded artificial and real flowers and other

The site is along the west side of County Road
2214. For the history of land ownership from
1854 until 1901, see 41RK718.
In 1901, Benjamin G. Kelly sold four
acres out of the Freeman Survey to the Zion
Hill Missionary Baptist Church for $5 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 81:138). Around the turn
of the century, James Kuykendall had sold one
acre at the northwest corner of his homestead
to the church for $1 (Rusk County, Deed Record

of the land for a school with the stipulation that
it would revert to church use when it no longer
served educational purposes (Rusk County, Deed
Record 100:168).
In 1926, Clarence Russell Flanagan sold
two acres to the church for $100 (Rusk County,
Deed Record 129:598). At least one building was
present on the land in 1930 (Tobin International
1930). A large building was extant in 1939
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1939).
In 1950, the church sold use of the land to
the Masonic Brothers Lodge #184 for $20 with
the stipulation that it would revert to church
use when it no longer served organizational
purposes (Rusk County, Deed Record 462:373).
The large building and a smaller building were
on the property in 1960 (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1960).
Today, a ca. 1970 T-plan, brick-clad building stands in the location of an earlier building.
It is reminiscent of the ubiquitous, classically
inspired small church in America. A front-gable main façade, centered double-door entry
with front-gable portico and flanking windows,
rhythmically placed windows lining the long
side façades, and steeple define the worship
space.
In more recent times, the church has
become known as the Original Zion Hill Baptist
Church, which continues to own the land (Rusk
County, Appraisal District Records 2013; Rusk
County, Deed Record 3133:583).

Description
Site 41RK725 is a diffuse prehistoric lithic
scatter at elevations of 280–290 ft on a toeslope
to footslope along a small drainage just west of
railroad tracks along the east edge of the project
area (Figure 4.72). The site is confined to the edge
of a tree line on slightly higher topography than
the adjacent areas to the north and south. Only
a small trace of the site remains, and much of it
is now eroded by drainage from higher ground
to the west. Moderately open woods encompass
the site and include oaks, sweetgums, elms, and
scattered loblolly pines. Pasture to the south has
short grasses with active cattle grazing. Cattle
grazing, erosion, and animal burrowing are the
most active disturbance agents observed. Land
clearing for hay pasture and selective timber
thinning of the wooded area have impacted the
site as well.
Eight shovel tests, with four positive for
prehistoric cultural materials, were excavated and define a site measuring 15 m northwest-southeast by 25 m southwest-northeast
(see Table 4.1). The recovered assemblage consists of three complete flakes, one proximal flake
fragment, and one medial flake fragment. One
each is brown chert, Ogallala quartzite, brown
quartzite, petrified wood, and brown and pink
mottled chert, all representing probable local
sources. The artifact density is 1.2 per positive
test. Two artifacts were recovered at 0–20 cm,
two at 20–40 cm, and one at 60–80 cm. The site
may have functioned as a short-term campsite
or special-purpose area, but otherwise it is hard
to say much about it.
Soils are mapped as Tenaha loamy fine
sand, which are present on side slopes of upland
interfluves and hills (Griffith 2000). Shovel tests
revealed sandy deposits 44–97+ cm deep, averaging 57 cm in the six tests that reached the
argillic horizon. Typically, the upper 10–20 cm
is loosely consolidated brown to grayish-brown
loamy sand with scattered carbon and unburned
wood fragments and gravels, and the lower
20–35 cm is loose to moderately consolidated
cream-colored silt to fine sandy silt and a few
small gravels. The argillic horizon consists of a
moderately to well consolidated yellowish-orange sandy silty clay.

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK724 has functioned as the Zion
Hill Cemetery since about 1901. A church congregation has been associated with the cemetery since that time, and a school and Masonic
Lodge were once part of the facility. Historic
cemeteries generally are not considered eligible for listing in the National Register because
“for profoundly personal reasons, familial and
cultural descendants of the interred often view
graves and cemeteries with a sense of reverence
and devout sentiment that that can overshadow
objective evaluation,” unless they meet special
Criteria Considerations A–G (Potter and Boland
1992:1, 14–18). Site 41RK724 does not meet
these requirements. Cemeteries such as this one
are protected by state laws, though.

of the project area (Figure 4.73). A series of four
elongate topographic high points on the floodplain margin were shovel tested. These rises
are areas of deeper and better-drained sandy
deposits than the silty clays and silty clay loams
that characterize much of the floodplain environment. Typical floodplain vegetation prevails,
except on the highest ground where occasional
loblolly pines, oaks, and sweetgums grow. Highwater marks on trees indicate that these small
rises can flood or at least be surrounded by
standing water. A variety of disturbances were
noted: erosion, tree throws, animal burrowing,
and periodic inundation. The site and surrounding area also were selectively thinned of some
timber in the past.
Fourteen shovel tests were excavated and
define a diffuse lithic scatter distributed over an
area 40 m northwest-southeast by 95 m southwest-northeast. Seven tests contained 20 pieces
of lithic debris and 1 burned nutshell fragment
(see Table 4.1), for an artifact density of 2.9 per
positive test. Artifact types represented are 12

Site 41RK725 is a very sparse upland lithic
scatter, which probably was used as a short-term
campsite or resource procurement location. The
scarceness of artifacts, upland setting, and lack
of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable
organic materials indicate that isolating components and dating them would be problematic, if
not impossible. With these limitations, 41RK725
is judged not to contain important information
about Native American use of the project area
and is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.

complete small flakes, 4 proximal flake fragments, 2 medial flake fragments, and 2 shatter.
Lithic materials consist of local and possible
nonlocal types. Local types are 1 each of Ogallala
chert and Ogallala quartzite, 4 brown and translucent brown cherts, 1 pink chert, 1 mottled gray
chert, 2 petrified wood, and 1 hematite. Possible
nonlocal materials are 9 gray chert pieces. There
is a nearly even vertical distribution of cultural material to a depth of 80 cm: 4 artifacts at
0–20 cm, 3 at 20–40 cm, 5 at 40–60 cm, and 8
at 60–80 cm. The single piece of burned nutshell
was found at 60–80 cm.

The site is on a section of floodplain where
soils are mapped as Estes clay, frequently flooded, with Woden fine sandy loam on the floodplain
rises (Griffith 2000). Shovel testing confirmed
that the deposits surrounding the low rises are
different than those comprising the rises. Shovel
test depths varied from 10 to 100 cm. The average shovel test depth and the average depth to
the argillic horizon was 63 cm. Shovel tests on
the rises that were positive for cultural material
varied in depth from 75 to 80 cm; however, one
shallow shovel test (DB849) did yield a petrified
wood flake at 0–20 cm. Shovel Tests DB850 and

a historic well. There was no visible concrete or
brick lining or aboveground portion. The hole
was filled with debris from the onsite dumping,
including an old hot water tank. No dimensions
could be determined because the opening had
eroded and partially collapsed on one side.
Eight shovel tests were excavated and
define a site area of 20 m east-west by 35 m
north-south. Four tests were positive for historic
artifacts, for a density of 8.3 items per positive
test (see Table 4.1). The assemblage consists of
16 pieces of clear container glass, 2 window glass
sherds, 3 pieces of clear glass shatter, 2 plain
whiteware sherds, an unidentifiable .22-caliber
shell casing, 6 wire nails, 1 fence staple, 1 piece of
wire, and 1 other metal item. Also recovered was
a single Ogallala chert distal flake fragment that
is considered to be an isolated find rather than
an indicator of a prehistoric component. Twentyeight of the historic artifacts (85 percent) were
found at depths of 0–40 cm, with the remainder
coming from 40–70 cm. The wire nails and wire
fence staple indicate occupation after the early
1890s (Wells 1998:87), while the rest of the
assemblage could date to either the nineteenth
or twentieth century and thus is not diagnostic.
Soils are mapped as Estes clay and Woden
fine sandy loam (Griffith 2000). Average shovel
test depth was 51 cm, and the argillic horizon
was encountered between 25 and 70 cm in all
but one shovel test.

DB851 had typical profiles with very loosely
consolidated silty to fine sandy deposits varying
from yellowish-brown to pale yellowish-brown
above moderately consolidated silty clay.
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK726 is a sparse lithic scatter on a
series of high spots at the edge of the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain. The physical setting and
meager assemblage suggest only brief utilization
of this locality, perhaps to exploit seasonally
available resources. Given the nature of the
archeological remains, the lack of temporally
diagnostic artifacts, and the scarceness of dateable organic materials, it is highly unlikely that
discrete cultural components could be isolated
and dated. Therefore, 41RK726 is judged not
to contain important information about Native
American use of the project area and is considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places. No further archeological investigation is recommended.
Site 41RK727
Description
Site 41RK727 is a historic farmstead on the
eroded Pleistocene terrace in the far northeastern
corner of the project area. The site is at an elevation of 270 ft on a toeslope above the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain along the east edge of a gas well
pad and gas well/pipeline access road (Figure
4.74). County Road 2210 is about 30 m east of
the site. Site 41RK726 is directly north beyond
the gas well pad. Vegetation is loblolly pines and
deciduous hardwoods with a thin to moderate
understory. The toeslope area is gullied and rilled
by erosion and water flow toward the floodplain.
Much of the site surface has been impacted by
construction of the gas well pad and access roads.
Debris dumping has created low broad piles of
clear and colored glass containers, plastic bottles, sanitary cans, buckets, and car parts. These
debris piles have concentrated and directed flow
downslope across the site. Most of this debris appears to be trash deposited along the county road
and has nothing to do with the historic component.
Improvements are evident at this location on the
1939 and 1960 aerial photographs.
The only cultural feature identified is a
partially filled hole or depression that may be

Site History
Site 41RK727 is on Tract R046-015.02,
which encompasses 200 acres out of the southeast quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre Russell
Williamson Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site is
along the east side of the tract, on the west side
of County Road 2210.
The land on which 41RK727 is situated
does not appear to have been occupied until the
late 1930s. James Winwright Flanagan owned
the Williamson Survey along with other adjacent
land by 1875 (Rusk County, Deed Record W:605).
He sold a one-half interest to his wife, Sallie P.
Ware Flanagan, and her son, John A. Ware, in
1881 for $12,500 (Rusk County, Deed Record
29:195). In 1891, John A. Ware sold a one-half
interest in the land to John A. Vinson for $10,000
(Rusk County, Deed Record 40:132). In 1899,
Vinson sold his one-half interest to Horace B.
Ware for $2,000 (Rusk County, Deed Record

54:148). In, 1911, the Williamson Survey was
partitioned, and Sallie P. Ware Flanagan was
awarded a 1,704-acre parcel mostly south of the
railroad (Rusk County, District Court Minutes
2:624). She died in 1931, and her estate conveyed
the 1,704 acres to her daughter, Irma Flanagan
Burr (Rusk County, Deed Record 307:192; Rusk
County, Probate Record 193:631). None of these
families lived on the property (Rusk County, Ad
Valorem Tax Records).
In 1937, Burr sold the land to African
American Major J. Kennedy for $17,000 (Rusk
County, Deed Record 307:192). Kennedy lived on
a farm he owned along the Baton and Peterson

Road in the eighth precinct outside the project
area with his wife, Mary, and their seven children
in 1930 (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census 1930b). Ten years later, they lived
in the second precinct along the Negro School to
Henderson Highway with nine of their children,
two sons-in-law, and a granddaughter. His daughter Almora and her husband, Lamar Elder, were
both schoolteachers. The land they lived on was
appraised at $1,500 that year (U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1940). No
improvements were apparent in the location of
41RK727 in 1930, although some land in the vicinity, surrounded by trees, was under cultivation
196

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
Nineteen shovel tests define a site area
measuring 80 m northwest-southeast by 15 m
southwest-northeast. Only 2 tests were positive
for prehistoric lithic artifacts, providing a density of 1.0 item per positive test (see Table 4.1).
Two lithic artifacts were recovered: a Kent dart
point of Ogallala quartzite at 60–70 cm and a
small brown chert flake at 60–80 cm. The Kent
point was manufactured from a pebble or cortical flake (Figure 4.76). Cortex is present on the
base of the stem and one portion of a blade face.
Although the soils are mapped as frequently flooded Laneville loam (Griffith 2000), the sediments exposed by shovel testing do not conform
to this soil type. The loose sandy nature of the
site deposits may indicate that they are Iulus
or Owentown series soils, which occupy similar
floodplain landform positions as Laneville but
are better drained and less frequently flooded.
Average shovel test depth was 100 cm, and
none encountered the argillic horizon. The
sediments consist of dark yellowish-brown to
yellowish-brown loose loamy sands to depths
of about 70 cm, changing to mottled yellow and
brown loamy sands with a few ironstone gravels.

(Tobin International 1930). By 1939, improvements were apparent in the location of the site
and remained extant in 1960 (U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939, 1960).
In 1966, Kennedy’s heirs sold the land to
J. S. Hudnall and G. W. Pirtle for $33,229.87
(Rusk County, Deed Record 843:11). Most recently, Evelyn Yvonne Byrd, Walter Earl Stephenson,
and Jackson Macarthur have owned the land
(Rusk County, Appraisal District Records 2013).
Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK727 is on land that was never
occupied by its owners. Hence, the twentieth-century improvements were likely related to tenant
occupancy during the time Kennedy owned the
land. It is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places because it
dates entirely to the twentieth century, probably
was occupied until near mid-century, has limited
features that could provide information on site
layout, was occupied by tenants and thus is of unknown associations, and has been badly disturbed,
all of which indicate that it is a poor candidate for
contributing important archeological information
about the history of the area. No further archeological investigation is recommended.

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK728 is a sparse lithic scatter on a
low rise in the Cherokee Bayou floodplain. The
physical setting and meager assemblage suggest
only brief utilization of this locality, perhaps to
exploit seasonally available resources, and the
Kent dart point suggests some of this use was
during the Late Archaic or maybe Woodland
period. Given the nature of the archeological
remains and the lack of dateable organic materials, however, it is highly unlikely that discrete
cultural components could be isolated and dated.
Therefore, 41RK728 has no potential to provide
important information concerning area prehistory and is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.

Site 41RK728
Description
This site is a very diffuse prehistoric lithic
scatter at an elevation of 245 ft atop a broad
level low rise on the east side of a shallow drainage channel on the Cherokee Bayou floodplain
(Figure 4.75). The rise is only about 0.5 m above
the adjacent drainage, and the area is frequently
inundated. This site occupies a spot on the wide
floodplain in front of a stream valley mouth and
has deciduous hardwoods, occasional loblolly
pines, and thistles. The presence of pine trees
and thistles indicate that the area is better
drained than the surrounding floodplain. The
site is just below the northern boundary of the
project area, and the Cherokee Bayou channel
is just beyond this boundary. A suite of disturbances were identified and include erosion, periodic inundation, tree throws, animal burrowing,
crayfish tubes, and previous selective timber
thinning across the landform.

stream channel as it enters the Cherokee Bayou
floodplain (Figure 4.77). To the southwest is a
larger inundated swampy area corresponding
to the stream mouth beyond the south valley
wall. Vegetation consists of hardwoods, some
loblolly pines, and palmettos. There are no
notable high-water marks on the trees on the
landform, and thus it may not be regularly inundated. Disturbances include erosion, animal
burrowing, and tree throws. The site also has
been selectively thinned of timber in the past.
Similarly located site 41RK728 is about 100 m
to the north-northwest and may be part of the
same discontinuous site complex.
Twenty-one shovel tests were excavated
across the landform and define a site area
measuring 15 m northwest-southeast by 100 m
southwest-northeast. Four tests yielded five ar-

consistent with Iulus fine sandy loam (Griffith
2000:48). Shovel test depth varied between 72
and 100 cm and averaged 94 cm. Only three tests
reached the argillic horizon at 80 cm. The argillic horizon is saturated yellowish-orange silty
sandy clay with gray, white, and brown mottles,
possibly having redoximorphic characteristics.

bipolar flake, one dart point or biface fragment
(Figure 4.78a), and one plain prehistoric sherd
(Figure 4.78b). The artifact density is 1.2 items
per positive test. Lithic materials consist of two
red chert, one Ogallala chert, and one possibly
nonlocal dark chert. It is difficult to determine
what portion of the biface is represented by the
fragment, but it may be a distal portion broken
in a bending fracture. The ceramic sherd is an
eroded clay-paste specimen consistent with
Caddo ware but is otherwise not diagnostic.
Cultural materials were recovered between
60 and 100 cm: three at 60–80 cm and two at
80–100 cm.
Soils are mapped as frequently flooded Laneville loam (Griffith 2000), but as for
41RK728 just to the north-northeast, the
sediments observed in shovel tests are more

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK729 is a small lithic and ceramic
scatter on elevated land above the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain. The location within a frequently flooded landscape suggests occupations
were of short duration and perhaps related to
exploitation of the surrounding bottomlands.
It is one of five sites spread along the length
of the floodplain east-west that could have the
capacity to yield useful information about Native

ruinous. Disturbances include erosion, animal
burrowing, and trash dumping. It appears to be
a single structure on the 1930 and 1939 aerial
photographs and a complex of structures on the
1960 aerial.
Thirteen shovel tests were excavated across
the site. The 5 positive tests and the distribution
of surface features define a site measuring 115 m
northwest-southeast by 65 m southwest-northeast, extending from the county road on the
north end to the spring box in the creek on the
south end.
The house is a ca. 40x24-ft board-and-batten structure with wood cladding underlain by
brick-pattern asphalt paper. The machine-made
red brick chimney is on the northwest front
corner of the house. The front porch has collapsed. The roof is made of multiple layers of
asphalt roofing shingles capped over later with
roll roofing material. An exposed portion of the
underlying roof shingle pattern shows that red
and white French-method shingles were employed. These asphalt shingles are 12x12 inches
and usually required storm anchors to hold them
down due to their size. French-method shingles
are shaped like diamonds or hexagons and are
meant to replicate the slate roofs of French
chateaux (Wilson and Snodgrass 2008:3). This
type of roofing was usually insufficient for new
construction, as it only provided one layer of
roofing protection. This may be the reason the
roll roofing was placed over the French shingles.
There are exposed rafter tails along the sides
of the roof.
The wood shed is to the west side of the back
of the house and appears to have been a small
storage structure. It is made of milled lumber
and wire nails and has a corrugated tin roof
that slopes down to the west. The metal shed is
a commercial type from probably the 1970s or
1980s; it is at the back southwest corner of the
house. A second corrugated tin and lumber roof
has been constructed above the original metal
roof. The collapsed privy is ca. 45 m due south
of the back of the house and is constructed of
wood and plywood and has a sloped corrugated
metal roof. There are piles of structural debris
on the west and east sides of the house that do
not appear to be related to the standing residence. The livestock pen, constructed of hog wire,
barbed wire, and wooden posts, is 15 m northsouth and 20 m east-west. The spring box in the
small drainage at the south end of the property

American use of the floodplain. No instances of
archeological remains within stratified Holocene
alluvium were observed in the shovel tests, but
it is possible that such contexts could be present, particularly on the lower margins of the
landform. If so, it may be comparatively easy
to isolate components in some areas. The single
sherd indicates that it has a Caddo component,
and thus it appears to have the potential to
contribute to a better understanding of Caddo
settlement systems, particularly that associated
with the Early Caddo ceremonial center at the
Hudnall-Pirtle site on the Sabine River not far
to the northeast. Site 41RK729 is considered
potentially eligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places under Criterion D,
pending test excavations to more fully gauge its
age, content, and integrity.
Site 41RK730
Description
Site 41RK730 is a historic farmstead at an
elevation of 280 ft along the interface between
the south valley wall and a Pleistocene terrace
(Figure 4.79). The site is beneath some large
older trees and consists of a relatively open front
yard area and structural features including a
house, a tin shed, a wood shed, a collapsed privy,
two possible collapsed other structures (or perhaps debris piles), a livestock pen, and a spring
box or well at the back of the property along a
small unnamed stream. The other buildings
appear to be later in construction materials and
style than the house. All of the structures are

consists of an older-style concrete casing sunk
to its upper rim in the channel of a small creek
bed. It would have been covered with a concrete
cap of the same diameter, a fragment of which
lies on the south bank of the creek. Along the
front of the property is a fence with a wire/pole
gate entry into the property.
The recovered artifact assemblage totals 29
items, for a density of 5.8 per positive test (see
Table 4.1). It consists of 3 pieces of clear container glass, 2 pieces of window glass, 1 Vaseline(?)
jar lid, 13 wire nails, 1 bolt/nut, 1 bull snap, 4
miscellaneous pieces of metal, 2 unidentified
brick fragments, and 2 plastic items. All artifacts

were recovered from the surface to a depth of
40 cm. The wire nails, jar lid, and plastic items
are consistent with occupation during the twentieth century (Spude 2014; Wells 1998:87), while
the rest of the assemblage could date to either
the nineteenth or twentieth century and thus
is not diagnostic.
Soils are mapped as the Sawlit-Sawtown
complex (Griffith 2000). Shovel test depth varied
from 17 to 100 cm and averaged 54 cm. The
argillic horizon was encountered in seven tests
at 17–65 cm and was dry friable orange sandy
clay. Ironstone gravels were common in many of
the shovel tests.

Site History

since at least 1910, when they were renting a
farm along the Henderson and Harmony Hill
Road (U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor,
Bureau of the Census 1910). They built the ca.
1915 house (Resource 42) on the property and
lived on the farm they owned for several decades (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau
of the Census 1920, 1930b, 1940). The property
was appraised at $400 in 1925 and 1930, but
gradually declined in value and was appraised
at only $150 by 1945 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records). Improvements were present
on the property in 1930, 1939, and 1960, and
each of these years land was in cultivation and
pasture, and a large stand of trees was present
(Tobin International 1930; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939, 1960).
By 1974, the parcel was considered to be
48.16 acres (Rusk County, Deed Record 987:51).
Most recently, the Manuel James Sr. estate, a
surviving daughter, Louise James Shaw, and a
surviving adopted granddaughter, Patricia June
James Hamilton, have owned the land (Rusk
County, Appraisal District Records 2013).

Site 41RK730 (Resource 42) is on Tract
R026-022, which encompasses 48.16 acres out
of the northeast quadrant of the 4,428.4-acre
Thomas O’Bar Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site
is near the northeast edge of the tract, just south
of the intersection of County Roads 2194 and
2210. For the history of land ownership from
1854 until 1913, see 41RK690.
By 1890, William A. Phelps and Ashton
Phelps owned a 276-acre parcel out of the O’Bar
Survey that they sold to Walter C. Robinson
(1851–1909) that April for $615 (Rusk County,
Deed Record 39:116; Stroud 1919:149; U.S.
Department of the Interior, Census Office
1900a). Robinson had married Eunice Cleopatra
Stroud (1851–1918), and they lived in Alabama
in 1880 with their young children (Anonymous
2009a; Stroud 1919:149; U.S. Department of the
Interior, Census Office 1880b). She was annually assessed for taxes on the land and livestock
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). Three
of their four surviving children and a niece
lived with them by 1900 (U.S. Department of
the Interior, Census Office 1900a). After her
husband’s 1909 death, the widowed Robinson
lived with her son John N. Robinson on the farm
she owned (U.S. Department of Commerce and
Labor, Bureau of the Census 1910).
By 1913, her other son, Dana S. Robinson,
who had been a boarder elsewhere in Rusk
County in 1910, sold the 100 acres out of the
O’Bar Survey to Clarence Russell Flanagan
(Rusk County, Deed Record 73:482; U.S.
Department of Commerce and Labor 1910).
Flanagan lived on a farm he owned along the
Longview and Carthage Road with his wife and
three of their children in 1910 (U.S. Department
of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of the Census
1910). It is unclear whether the property containing 41RK730 was occupied at that time
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1915, Flanagan sold a 49.4-acre parcel to
African American Manuel James Sr. (ca. 1888–
1978) for $600 (Rusk County, Deed Records
84:53, 1408:576, 1429:269; U.S. Department of
Commerce and Labor, Bureau of the Census
1910). He had married Johanna Norris in
October 1907, and they had nine children (Rusk
County, Deed Records 1408:576, 1429:269; U.S.
Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of
the Census 1910). They had lived in the vicinity

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK730 is on land that was associated
with Walter C. and Eunice Cleopatra Stroud
Robinson from 1890 to 1913 and with Manuel
and Johanna James beginning in 1915. The archeological remains at 41RK730, and the extant
house, relate to the occupation by the James
family. It is considered ineligible for listing in
the National Register of Historic Places because
it dates entirely to the twentieth century and
has abundant remains relating to occupation
until at least mid-century, indicating that it
is a poor candidate for contributing important
archeological information about the history of
the area. No further archeological investigation
is recommended.
Site 41RK731
Description
Site 41RK731 is a diffuse prehistoric lithic
scatter on an eroded summit and shoulder
area of a low hill on the west edge of a planted
garden at elevations of 300–310 ft (Figure 4.80).
Portions of the woodland area west of the site

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
Soils are mapped as Rentzel loamy fine
sand (Griffith 2000), which is common on upland
toeslope positions. Shovel test depth varies
from 70 to 110 cm and averages 95 cm. Only
three tests encountered the argillic horizon at
70–95 cm; it is pale orange well-consolidated
sandy clay. The overlying sediments are very
pale cream to gray sandy silt with a few small
ironstone gravels.

have been selectively thinned for timber and
are considerably overgrown in dense secondary
vegetation. Shovel testing was not conducted
within the garden area east of the site since it
was still planted in watermelons and beans at
the time of survey. Disturbances include tree
clearing, erosion, and animal burrowing.
Of the seven shovel tests excavated, three
were positive for three prehistoric lithic artifacts, for a density of 1.0 item per positive test
(see Table 4.1). Shovel testing defined a site
area measuring 35 m north-south by 30 m eastwest. The artifacts are two pieces of petrified
wood and dark gray chert shatter and a flake
fragment of petrified wood. One piece of shatter
was at 60–80 cm, while the other artifacts were
recovered between 80 and 95 cm. The activities
represented probably are tool maintenance or
late-stage tool manufacture.

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK731 is a very sparse upland lithic
scatter, which probably was used as a short-term
campsite or resource procurement location. The
scarceness of artifacts, upland setting, and lack
of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable
organic materials indicate that isolating components and dating them would be problematic, if

not impossible. With these limitations, 41RK731
is judged not to contain important information
about Native American use of the project area
and is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.

The prehistoric artifact density is only 1.0 per
positive test, and the historic artifact density
is only 2.0. The prehistoric materials consist
of a probable novaculite biface fragment from
the surface and a petrified wood flake found at
40–60 cm. Historic artifacts consist of a small
piece of salt-glazed stoneware, two fragments
of cut nails, and a piece of clear container glass
found at 0–40 cm. The stoneware sherd and cut
nails suggest occupation during the nineteenth
century (Stelle 2001:11; Wells 1998:87), while
the glass could date to either the nineteenth or
twentieth century and thus is not diagnostic.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine sand,
which is characteristic of broad upland ridges in
the southern part of the project area (Griffith
2000). Average shovel test depth was 91 cm,
and only four tests reached the argillic horizon
between 40 and 100 cm. The overlying deposits
consist of light brown to reddish-brown sandy
silt with scattered pieces of weathered subangular ferrous sandstone and some ironstone
gravels above reddish-orange silty sandy clay.

Site 41RK732
Description
Site 41RK732 is a multicomponent prehistoric lithic scatter and historic farmstead at an
elevation of 300 ft in maintained pasture in the
southeast part of the project area (Figure 4.81).
The landform is an upland hill with steep slopes
on the east edge where there is a broad shallow intermittent drainage with a minor seep.
Steeper slopes are present to the east where
the small stream turns slightly northeast and
flows under the adjacent railroad tracks. The
north end of the site has been mechanically altered, perhaps due to county road construction
or mining for sand or other purposes. An area
approximately 70 m east-west and 20 m northsouth has been removed, which has impacted
both the prehistoric and historic occupations
on the hilltop and slopes. Other disturbances
include cattle trampling, active animal burrowing, and erosion. Adjacent parcels to the
north and southwest are wooded with loblolly
pines, oaks, hickories, sweetgums, and other
trees with open to moderately dense understory.
Abundant hematite gravels and some sandstone
bedrock are close to the surface on the hill. No
improvements are evident in this location on
the 1930 and 1939 aerials; buildings are present
on the 1960 aerial, but they are adjacent to the
county road to the north of the site, in the area
that has been subjected to earthmoving. Those
improvements apparently do not relate to the
earlier archeological remains on the hilltop just
to the south.
Nine shovel tests were excavated across
the landform summit, and only two were
positive for historic or prehistoric cultural
materials (see Table 4.1). An additional prehistoric artifact was collected from the surface
adjacent to an animal burrow backdirt pile.
Shovel test and surface evidence produce a site
size of 45 m north-south by 25 m east-west.
The recovered artifact assemblage consists
of four historic and two prehistoric artifacts.

Site History
Site 41RK732 is on Tract R735-005, which
encompasses 126.12 acres out of the south half of
the 640-acre Edward Simon Survey. The site is in
the west portion of the tract, west of the ca. 1882
Longview and Sabine Valley Railway, known
as the Texas, Sabine Valley and Northwestern
Railway in 1887, and bounded by County Road
2210 on the south and west sides.
The State of Texas patented the survey to
Simon’s heirs in March 1851, and the administrator for his estate conveyed 120 acres out
of the north end of the survey’s south half to
Georgia native Britton F. Stamps in 1853 (Rusk
County, Deed Record H:234; Texas General Land
Office 1851). Stamps and his family likely lived
elsewhere in Rusk County at the time (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
Stamps conveyed the property to native
Georgian Pierce Clay in 1854 (Rusk County,
Deed Record I:421). It is unclear where he resided with his family at the time, or how long he
owned the property (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records).
By 1857, South Carolina native Daniel R.
Bowen owned the 120 acres out of the Simon
Survey (Latham 2013; Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records). He lived with his South Carolina–

born wife, Martha Ann Pruitt Bowen (1831–
1870), their three young Texas-born children,
and his 78-year-old mother, who was also a South
Carolinian (Latham 2013; U.S. Department of
the Interior, Census Office 1860a). It is unclear
how long the family occupied this land, but
as late as 1877, their only son, William Craig
Bowen (1855–1932), probably occupied the
property with his wife, Margaret Russ Bowen
(Medlin 2009b; Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Record; U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1880a).
In 1878, Bowen, acting as an agent for his
father and his brother-in-law and sister, G. S.
and Nancy M. Bowen, conveyed the 120 acres
to Texas native James W. Kuykendall (Rusk
County, Deed Record 29:541). Kuykendall oc-

cupied the property with his family until 1891
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
The land changed hands frequently in the
1890s. By 1891, M. F. and M. O. Walrand owned
three parcels—of 50, 4, and 2.45 acres—out of
the Simon Survey, when they sold it to J. P.
Scruggs for $208 in 1891 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 41:315). He briefly occupied the land
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). Site
41RK732 is situated on the eastern half of the
50-acre parcel. That December, Scruggs sold
the three parcels to W. T. Hemby for $220, who
occupied the land briefly, but held no livestock
(Rusk County, Deed Record 41:317).
In 1893, W. T. Hemby sold the land to T. M.
Hemby for $200, who also briefly occupied the
land, and had 5 equine, 25 bovine, 4 hogs, and a
205

wagon (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records;
Rusk County, Deed Record 41:607). In 1894,
T. M. and L. E. Hemby sold the land to Owen
Kuykendall (1872–1913) for $600 (Anonymous
2010d; Rusk County, Deed Record 90:157). He
had married Lucy Aldora Harper (1873–1955)
(Anonymous 2010e). The Kuykendalls lived on
the land and owned it until 1910 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records).

upland pasture on the south side of County Road
2216 as it makes a sharp turn to the north in the
southeast part of the project area (Figure 4.82). A
chimney base is at the south end of the knoll and
marks the location of the house. What appear to
be displaced native stone footers and a scatter of
historic artifacts attest to the location. The area
surrounding the site is pasture with a few scattered trees and abandoned farming implements.
Use of the location as a cattle feeding area has
promoted considerable cattle trampling, leading to erosion and rutting of the surface. Other
disturbances include active animal burrowing.
Surface artifacts were observed exposed in
eroded areas and trailing away downslope to the
south. Improvements are evident here on the
1939 aerial photograph and perhaps the 1930
one, but they were gone by 1960.
The only cultural feature is the chimney
base of hand-made bricks set on edge topped
with machine-made fire bricks, which may be a
later addition or repair to the chimney (Figure
4.83). The chimney base is approximately 1x1 m
in size. At present, a cattle feeder mounted on
wooden skids is on the south side of the chimney,
which has been damaged by cattle trampling.
Stone footings for the house are present but
have been displaced around the chimney base.
Only seven shovel tests were excavated
at the site because the location is well defined
by surface artifacts, associated large trees, and
the chimney base feature. The site area is 55 m
north-south by 55 m east-west. The artifact
assemblage includes both surface-collected
material and artifacts found in six of the shovel
tests (see Table 4.1). Surface artifacts are a
heavily pitted and corroded double-bit axe head,
2 salt-glazed stoneware sherds, 1 milk glass
piece, and 1 brown and 2 clear container glass
fragments. The excavated assemblage of 70 artifacts, equating to an artifact density of 11.7 per
positive test, consists of 17 sherds of clear, brown,
aqua, and cobalt blue container glass; 1 milk
glass container; 4 window glass sherds; 1 plain
whiteware sherd; 4 cut nails and 2 wire nails; 1
piece of wire; 1 shotgun shell base; 1 buckle; 13
other pieces of metal; and 25 unidentified brick
fragments. All but 3 items were found at depths
of 40 cm or less; the other 3 were at 40–60 cm.
These artifacts suggest occupation during
both the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
The cut nails probably predate the 1890s introduction of wire nails (Wells 1998:87), and

Summary and Assessment
The land on which 41RK732 is situated
was associated with Britton F. Stamps (1853–
1854), Pierce Clay (1854–?), the Daniel and
William Craig Bowan families (1857–1878),
James W. Kuykendall (1878–1891), M. F. and
M. O. Walrand (1891), J. P. Scruggs (1891), W. T.
Hemby (1891–1893), T. M. Hemby (1893–1894),
and Owen and Lucy Aldora Harper Kuykendall
(1894–1910). Based on the nineteenth-century
age of the few artifacts, the historic component
could relate to occupation by any of these owners,
except the few who probably did not live on the
land. Site 41RK732 is considered ineligible for
National Register listing because its associations are unknown and it is an extremely sparse,
disturbed artifact scatter lacking structural
remains or other cultural features that could
provide information on site layout. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.
The prehistoric component at 41RK732
is a very sparse upland lithic scatter, which
probably was used as a short-term campsite or
resource procurement location. The scarceness
of artifacts, upland setting, and lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable organic
materials indicate that isolating components
and dating them would be problematic, if not impossible. With these limitations, the prehistoric
component at 41RK732 is judged not to contain
important information about Native American
use of the project area and is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places. No further archeological investigation is
recommended.

certain garments but may also have had other
dress applications (Cuddeford 1996:33, No. 13).
Similar buckles were used on a variety of garments from the 1930s and earlier including
Levi’s pants, men’s vests and waistcoats, men’s
spats, and ladies’ garters, among other items.
The shotgun shell head is a Federal Monark
No. 12, which postdates 1922 (Steinhauer 2014).
The remainder of the assemblage could date to
either the nineteenth or twentieth century and
thus is not diagnostic.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine sand,
which is characteristic of broad upland ridges in
the southern part of the project area (Griffith
2000). The average shovel test depth was 82 cm.
The argillic horizon was encountered at 60–70 cm

the hand-made bricks likely predate the late
1800s expansion of mechanized brick manufacture in Texas (Steinbomer 1982:53–54). The
salt-glazed stoneware sherds (Figure 4.84a)
may be early too. Manufacture of salt-glazed
stoneware vessels was common throughout the
nineteenth century but became less common
by the early twentieth century (Stelle 2001:11).
The wire nails, buckle, and shotgun shell head
relate to use in the twentieth century, with wire
nails becoming common only after 1900 (Wells
1998:87). The buckle is a two-piece rectangular
item of pressed metal with double-spiked tongue
(Figure 4.84b). The frame is stamped with
“PARIS” and the tongue-bar with “SOLIDE”.
This type of buckle was used as an adjuster on

until at least 1945 (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records; U.S. Department of the Interior,
Bureau of the Census 1930b). The Helvenstons
retained the land until 1965, when they conveyed it to their adult children: Mary Evelyn
Helvenston York, Leonard E. Helvenston,
Clarice Helvenston Garrett, and Ava Kathleen
Helvenston (Rusk County, Deed Record 820:662).
Improvements were present at the location of 41RK733 by at least 1939 but were no
longer extant by 1960 (Tobin International 1930;
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service 1939,
1960). In the 1939 aerial, it is the larger of
two farmsteads on the tract (the other being
41RK585 at the southeast corner), suggesting
that 41RK733 is the Helvenston homestead.

Site History
Site 41RK733 is on Tract R735-005, which
encompasses 126.12 acres out of the south half of
the 640-acre Edward Simon Survey (see Figure
4.8). The site is in the west half of the tract, near
its north edge, and east of County Road 2216.
For the land ownership history before 1910, see
41RK732.
In 1910, the Kuykendalls sold the land
to James M. Hayden (1845–1921) for $472
(Anonymous 2010f; Rusk County, Deed Record
78:171). He and his wife, Flora Jane Curry
Hayden, lived in Dallas at the time, although they
had moved to Rusk County by 1920 (Anonymous
2010f; U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of
the Census 1920; U.S. Department of Commerce
and Labor, Bureau of the Census 1910). It is unclear whether they occupied the property (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1912, the Haydens sold the land to W.
C. “Charley” Williamson for $633 (Rusk County,
Deed Record 78:172). He and his wife, Nettie,
had 10 children in 1910 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 92:146; U.S. Department of Commerce
and Labor, Bureau of the Census 1910). It is unclear whether they occupied the property (Rusk
County, Ad Valorem Tax Records).
In 1916, the Williamsons sold the land
to Alan N. Helvenston (1880–1965) for $800
(Nelson 2012; Rusk County, Deed Record
92:146). In 1900, Helvenston, from Florida, was
boarding in the household of George Jackson and
working as a farm laborer (U.S. Department of
the Interior, Census Office 1900a). Five years
after he purchased this farm, he and his wife,
Effie (1888–1966), were living with his parents
(Nelson 2012; U.S. Department of Commerce
and Labor, Bureau of the Census 1910). By
1920, the Helvenstons were living on their farm
with three children (U.S. Department of the
Interior, Bureau of the Census 1920). By 1930,
the Helvenstons had four children and were
living on the farm on the Tatum-to-Longview
Road, which they claimed as their homestead

Summary and Assessment
The land on which 41RK733 is situated was
associated with Britton F. Stamps (1853–1854),
Pierce Clay (1854–?), the Daniel and William
Craig Bowan families (1857–1878), James W.
Kuykendall (1878–1891), M. F. and M. O. Walrand
(1891), J. P. Scruggs (1891), W. T. Hemby (1891–
1893), T. M. Hemby (1893–1894), Owen and
Lucy Aldora Harper Kuykendall (1894–1910),
James M. and Flora Jane Curry Hayden (1910–
1912), W. C. “Charley” and Nettie Williamson
(1912–1916), and Alan N. and Effie Helvenston
(1916–1965). The primary twentieth-century
component appears to be the Helvenston homestead, while the nineteenth-century materials
probably are associated with the Bowans, James
Kuykendall, the Hembys, or Owen Kuykendall.
The site is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places, in spite
of the presence of remains relating to nineteenth-century occupation, because it appears
to have been used until near the middle of the
twentieth century, making it extremely unlikely
that a nineteenth-century component could be
isolated for interpretation, and because the associations of the early occupation are unclear. No
further archeological investigation is warranted.

fragment, a short metal chisel, a small plain
whiteware fragment, and a heavily corroded cut
nail fragment. The brick fragment and chisel
were at 0–20 cm, and the nail and whiteware
fragments were at 20–60 cm. The cut nail suggests occupation before the 1890s introduction of
wire nails (Wells 1998:87), while the rest of the
assemblage could date to either the nineteenth
or twentieth century and thus is not diagnostic.
Soils are mapped as Tenaha loamy fine
sand, which is common to upland interfluves
and side slopes in the southern part of the
project area (Griffith 2000). Shovel test depth
varied from 38 to 62 cm and averaged 49 cm.
Three tests reached the argillic horizon at

edge of an upland interfluve with a drainage
on the west side (Figure 4.85). The drainage
separates the site from 41RK735. County Road
2210 borders the south end of the site area. The
summit and shoulders of the interfluve are in
moderate woods consisting of scattered loblolly
pines and deciduous hardwoods with open to
moderately dense understory. Documented
disturbances include clearing, plowing, erosion,
active animal burrowing, and tree throws. None
of the historic aerial images or maps depict improvements at this location.
Shovel testing revealed a thin localized
scatter of artifacts. There are no surface indications of features such as a well, chimney,
or footing stones. Nine shovel tests excavated
across the landform define a site area measuring 20 m north-south by 20 m east-west. Three
positive shovel tests yielded just four artifacts,
for a density of 1.3 per positive test (see Table
4.1). The artifacts are an unidentified brick

the few artifacts and length of ownership, the
site most likely relates to use by the Bowans
or Kuykendalls. Site 41RK734 is considered
ineligible for National Register listing because
its associations are uncertain and it is an extremely sparse artifact scatter lacking structural
remains or other cultural features that could
provide information on site layout. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.

Site 41RK734 is on Tract R735-004, which
encompasses 112 acres out of the south half of
the 640-acre Edward Simon Survey (see Figure
4.8). The site is near the south edge of the tract,
west of the ca. 1882 Longview and Sabine Valley
Railway, known as the Texas, Sabine Valley and
Northwestern Railway in 1887, and on the north
side of County Road 2210. For the history of the
tract before 1878, see 41RK732.
In 1878, an agent for D. Bowan and G. S.
and N. M. Edwards sold 120 acres out of the
Simon Survey to James W. (1849–1900) and
Pheobe Ann McMurtry (1848–1929) Kuykendall
for $223 (Anonymous 2009b; Anonymous 2010f;
Rusk County, Deed Record 29:541). The couple
had married in Panola County, where they resided, in 1870 (U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1870). Ten years later, they lived
on their farm in Rusk County, which became
known as the family’s homestead, with four
of their children (Rusk County, Deed Record
58:558; U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1880a). The property appraisal varied
from $280 to $360 between 1887 and 1900
(Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax Records). By
1900, the family lived in Tyler County, and he
died that year (U.S. Department of the Interior,
Census Office 1900c). His widow married
James H. Gant in about 1905, when the land
was considered to be 114 acres (Rusk County,
Deed Records 35:131, 58:558). Kuykendall’s
estate was assessed for taxes on the property
until 1911, but it is unclear whether the property was occupied after 1900 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). In 1912, the Gants
and her heirs sold a 112-acre parcel out of
the Simon Survey to Albert Olin Menefee for
$1,000 (Rusk County, Deed Record 76:117).
For a history of land ownership from 1912 to
present, see 41RK684.

Site 41RK735
Description
Site 41RK735 is a historic farmstead in
an eroded upland setting at an elevation of
320 ft on the north side of County Road 2210
(Figure 4.86). A small clearing containing two
deer-hunting stands is present, and large oak
or hickory trees denote the probable location of
former structures. The area is in a wooded parcel
dominated by loblolly pines, oaks, hickories, and
sweetgums. Site 41RK734 is just to the east,
across a small drainage. Disturbances include
erosion, land clearing, the two-track road to the
deer stands, and active animal burrowing. The
1930 and 1939 aerial images show structures at
this location, but they were gone by 1960.
Shovel testing recovered limited evidence of
historic occupation but no evidence for cultural
features. Because of the high degree of disturbance, only five shovel tests were excavated,
yielding a small assemblage of 22 artifacts from
three tests for a density of 7.3 per positive test:
16 pieces of clear and brown container glass, 1
piece of window glass, 1 wire nail, 1 large spike,
1 bastard file, and 2 other pieces of metal (see
Table 4.1). The wire nail indicates occupation
after the early 1890s (Wells 1998:87), while the
rest of the assemblage could date to either the
nineteenth or twentieth century and thus is not
diagnostic. The site area is 20 m north-south by
35 m east-west. All artifacts were recovered at
0–20 cm.
Soils are mapped as Lilbert loamy fine sand
(Griffith 2000). The average depth of the shovel
tests is 80 cm, with two of them encountering the
argillic horizon at 70–80 cm. The typical stratigraphic sequence consists of an upper zone of
loosely consolidated pale gray very fine-grained
sandy silt overlying well-consolidated yellowish-brown silty sand, both having a moderate
density of small ironstone gravels.

Summary and Assessment
The land on which 41RK734 is situated was
associated with Britton F. Stamps (1853–1854),
Pierce Clay (1854–?), the Daniel and William
Craig Bowan families (1857–1878), James W.
Kuykendall (1878–ca. 1900), James H. and
Pheobe Ann McMurtry Kuykendall Gant (ca.
1900–1912), and Albert Olin Menefee (after
1912). Based on the nineteenth-century age of

Summary and Assessment

Site 41RK735, is on Tract R735-004, which
encompasses 112 acres out of the south half
of the 640-acre Edward Simon Survey (see
Figure 4.8). The site is near the south edge of
the tract, west of the ca. 1882 Longview and
Sabine Valley Railway, known as the Texas,
Sabine Valley and Northwestern Railway in
1887, and on the north side of County Road 2210.
For the land ownership history, see 41RK734.
With improvements at 41RK735 in the 1930s
(Tobin International 1930; U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service 1939), the site apparently
relates to the period of ownership by Albert Olin
Menefee beginning in 1912.

Site 41RK735 was associated with ownership of the land by Albert Olin Menefee and
his heirs during the first half of the twentieth
century. They lived elsewhere, and thus the site
likely was occupied by tenants. It is considered
ineligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places because it dates entirely to the
twentieth century, prfobably was occupied until
near mid-century, has no features that could provide information on site layout, and was occupied
by tenants and thus is of unknown associations,
all of which indicate that it is a poor candidate
for contributing important archeological information about the history of the area. No further
archeological investigation is recommended.

Site History

Description

Site 41RK736 is on Tracts R283-004.05,
R283-004.06, R283-004.07, and R283-004.08,
which, combined, encompass 19.31 acres out of
the south half of the 369-acre Thomas Freeman
Survey (see Figure 4.8). The site overlaps these
tracts and is east of County Road 2214, near its
intersection with County Road 2199. For the
land ownership history from 1853 to 1886, see
41RK718.
In 1886, Benjamin G. Kelly sold 59 acres
out of the Freeman Survey to African American
Green Robertson for $295 (Rusk County, Deed
Record 34:73). He and his wife, Harriet, were
native Tennesseans but lived in Rusk County by
1870 (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1870, 1880a). The couple resided on their
farm in 1900 with five grandchildren and a
nephew (U.S. Department of the Interior, Census
Office 1900a). They were at their farm along the
Flanagan and Tatum Road in 1910 with three
of their grandchildren and two nieces (U.S.
Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau
of the Census 1910). The property was generally appraised between $125 and $175, and he
usually owned a few equine, between 4 and 20
cattle, up to 20 swine, and between $5 and $25 in
miscellaneous goods (Rusk County, Ad Valorem
Tax Records).
In 1916, Robertson sold the land to
African American Wainwright C. Guice for
$750 (Rusk County, Deed Record 84:258). He
was a single man in 1910, renting property
along the Hendricks Lake and Tatum Road
(U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor,
Bureau of the Census 1910), and subsequently married George Ann (Rusk County, Deed
Record 124:566). The Guices lived somewhere
on the land (Rusk County, Ad Valorem Tax
Records), perhaps near 41RK736. When Guice
died in 1918, the lien holder, Homer Harris
Sr., acquired the land, but George Ann Guice
continued to occupy and farm the land with
the help of her children and stepchildren
(U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the
Census 1920).
In 1924, Harris sold the land to African
Americans James and George Ann Guice
Menefee for $395 (Rusk County, Deed Record
124:566). In 1930 and 1940, they lived on their
farm with their children (U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of the Census 1930b,

Site 41RK736 is a probable historic farmstead on a broad upland interfluve summit at
an elevation of 320 ft in the southeast part of
the project area (Figure 4.87). The east and west
sides of the interfluve are defined by erosional
channels for drainage into a stream on the
north end of the landform. The landform has
been significantly altered by excavation of a
gas well pad into its summit and shoulder, and
a gas pipeline cuts across the north end of the
site from southeast to northwest. The mechanically cut and sloped faces of the well pad edges
vary in depth from about 1.5 m on the west end
to about 2.5 m along the east edge of the pad.
Other disturbances include animal burrowing
and gullying and erosion along the edges of
the well pad. Presently, the site area is in high
grasses and dense secondary growth of shrubs
and saplings. The 1939 aerial image appears to
show a single structure at the northeast edge of
the site, but the 1930 aerial does not; the 1960
aerial shows no structures.
Eight shovel tests were excavated on the
landform, and three were positive, yielding an
artifact density of 4.0 per positive test and defining a site size of 25 m northwest-southeast by
60 m southwest-northeast (see Table 4.1). The
recovered assemblage totals only 12 artifacts
and consists of 2 sherds of solarized and clear
container glass, 2 other pieces of glass, 1 plain
whiteware sherd, 2 cut nails and 3 unidentified
nails, and 2 unidentified brick fragments. The
cut nails suggest occupation before the 1890s
introduction of wire nails (Wells 1998:87), and
the solarized glass likely dates to 1880–1920
(Lindsey 2014a). The rest of the assemblage
could date to either the nineteenth or twentieth
century and thus is not diagnostic. Nine artifacts
came from 0–20 cm, 2 from 20–40 cm, and 1
from 40–60 cm.
Soils are mapped as Latex very fine sandy
loam, which are common on some upland interfluve summits (Griffith 2000). The average
shovel test depth was 58 cm. Two shovel tests
encountered the argillic horizon at 50 and 71 cm,
but the others were halted at various depths by
very hard fine sandy silty loam sediments and
ironstone gravels. One test was halted by larger
hematite cobbles at 40 cm.

homestead beginning in 1925 (Rusk County,
Ad Valorem Tax Records). Improvements were
near but not at the location of 41RK736 in
the 1930s, with crop and pasture land and a
large stand of trees (Tobin International 1930;
U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural

tween 1854 and 1886, but they probably lived
on their previously acquired holdings in the
John Webster Survey to the south. The scant
archeological remains at the site most likely
relate to occupation by Green and Harriet
Robertson from 1886 to 1916. The Guice/
Menefee homestead probably was near the
location of 41RK736 but not at it. Although the
site has a restricted time span and is of known
associations, it is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
because it has only a sparse scatter of artifacts,
apparently lacks structural remains or other
cultural features to provide a spatial context
for interpretation, and has been disturbed by
well pad and pipeline construction.

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK736 is on land associated with

and is considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. No further

Description

ISOLATED FINDS

Site 41RK737 is a diffuse prehistoric
lithic scatter atop the summit and shoulder of
a small elongated east-west upland interfluve
at elevations of 310–320 ft overlooking a small
unnamed stream (Figure 4.88). Short drainages
on the west and northeast sides of the interfluve
define it. The summit and slopes are moderately
eroded. Vegetation is woodlands with scattered
loblolly pines and hardwoods, primarily oaks
with some sweetgums and other trees. A gas
pipeline along the south edge of the site traverses from southwest to northeast. A gas well
pad and adjacent pipeline are just north beyond
the site edge. In addition to the well pad and
pipelines, erosion, animal burrowing, and tree
throws are the obvious disturbances to the site
and surrounding area. In addition, much of the
area has been selectively thinned of timber.
Eight shovel tests were excavated and
define the site as being 50 m northwest-southeast by 30 m southwest-northeast. Two tests
yielded two artifacts, a complete small flake
and a piece of shatter of Ogallala quartzite, for
a density of 1.0 per positive test (see Table 4.1).
The shatter was obtained at 0–20 cm, and the
flake was from 20–40 cm.
Soils are mapped as Rentzel loamy fine
sand, which occurs on upland landforms and
toeslope settings (Griffith 2000). The average
depth of the tests was 52 cm. Six tests reached
the argillic horizon at depths of 36–73 cm.
Sediments overlying the argillic horizon consist
of an upper zone of loose brownish-gray sandy
silt with minor amounts of ironstone gravel and
a lower zone of orangish-gray sandy silt with a
few mottles of well-consolidated sandy silty clay.

A number of isolated artifacts were found
on the surface or in shovel testing. Additional
shovel testing in the vicinity resulted in no additional artifacts; hence, no site numbers were
assigned. Prehistoric isolated finds consist of
11 unmodified flakes, 2 dart point fragments, 1
piece of battered ferruginous sandstone, and 1
possible pitted stone. Historic isolated finds consist mostly of brick fragments, pieces of glass,
segments of wire, a music record fragment,
and ceramic sherds found singly or as multiple
small pieces of like material from one shovel
test, unassociated with other tests containing
artifacts. In a few cases, larger numbers (5–9) of
more than one kind of historic item were found
in a test but not designated as sites because the
tests were not near other positive tests, and no
reasonable site boundary could be defined. A
total of 35 historic artifacts were recorded as
isolated finds.
SITE DENSITY IN THE
PROJECT AREA
The surveyed lands within Rusk Permit
Area W contain 1 prehistoric component
per 100 acres and 1 historic component per
133 acres. Site densities are not even across
the area, however. Prehistoric components are
most common in floodplain settings (1 site per
69 acres), followed by the uplands (1 site per
99 acres); no prehistoric sites are in Pleistocene
terrace settings. Historic components are most
common in the uplands (1 site per 109 acres),
followed by Pleistocene terraces (1 site per
168 acres); no historic sites are on the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain.
Prehistoric components are much more
common in floodplain settings in this project
area than in the Area V survey to the east (1
per 69 acres vs. 1 per 548 acres) (Dockall et al.
2010:227). This can be partly explained by differences in stream and drainage basin size and
the decreased impact of flooding along Cherokee
Bayou relative to the Sabine River, with flood
events probably not as severe or of shorter duration along Cherokee Bayou. The higher den-

Summary and Assessment
Site 41RK737 is a very sparse upland lithic
scatter, which probably was used as a short-term
campsite or resource procurement location. The
scarceness of artifacts, upland setting, and lack
of temporally diagnostic artifacts or dateable
organic materials indicate that isolating components and dating them would be problematic, if
not impossible. With these limitations, 41RK737
is judged not to contain important information
about Native American use of the project area

sity of prehistoric components on the Cherokee
Bayou floodplain certainly indicates more use
of that environment than the larger Sabine
River floodplain, but the overall sparseness of
artifacts at all of the floodplain sites indicates
that that use was not intensive. Rather, it appears to have been from short-term occupations
probably related to procurement or processing of
bottomland plant or animal resources.
Prehistoric components also are much more
common in upland settings in Area W than in
Area V (1 per 99 acres vs. 1 per 226 acres). Some
of this difference may be attributable to the fact
that Area V has an extensive Pleistocene terrace
where sites are relatively numerous between
the uplands and the floodplain, while terrace

deposits in Area W are of limited extent. Hence,
selection of elevated spots above the floodplain
for site locations in the former may have favored terrace rather than upland valley wall
settings. Given that site densities on uplands
and terraces combined are still much higher in
Area W than Area V (1 per 109 acres vs. 1 per
190 acres), though, it appears that other factors
are at play. The bigger explanation probably
lies in the fact that the Area W uplands are
drained by more intermittent streams than
Area V. These streams provided more reliable
water sources to the adjacent upland areas, and
these fostered more use by Native Americans.
As on the Cherokee Bayou floodplain, though,
artifact densities appear to be uniformly low,
216

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
Though both Martin Lake and Oak Hill consist
of large expanses of uplands where sites should
be infrequent, both also contain perennial tributary stream valleys where one would expect high
site densities. Indeed, sites are present along
these streams, and some of these sites, such as
Oak Hill Village, reflect intensive and long-term
use. But the low densities of prehistoric sites
suggest that, overall, the uplands south of the
Sabine River were sparsely settled compared to
the area north of the river. For at least parts of
the Caddo period, this could indicate that the
area south of the river was a buffer zone between
intensively used parts of the Sabine valley to the
north and the Neches valley to the south.
Historic site densities also are widely divergent, although not as dramatically as prehistoric
site densities (see Table 4.2). The Rusk Permit
area and Sabine Mine north of the river have
essentially identical values, while Martin Lake
Mine and Oak Hill Mine have lower site densities that are similar to one another. Given the
multiplicity of factors that probably controlled
settlement density, it is hard to know how to
interpret these differences, or whether they
are very meaningful. All four project areas are
sufficiently close to one another and to early
transportation routes and early settlements,
however, that it seems unlikely that variability
in these factors is the answer.

implying that these upland sites were used in a
nonintensive fashion, i.e., as short-term camps
or procurement or processing locations.
Patterns in historic site distributions are
very similar in the two survey areas, with sites
restricted to areas outside floodplains (i.e., uplands and Pleistocene terraces) and occurring
in nearly equal densities (1 per 112 acres in
Area V and 1 per 108 acres in Area W). These
distributions undoubtedly relate to the following: (1) floodplains were too low and wet
to have seen substantial use; (2) uplands and
terraces saw relatively intensive use because
the landscape is level to gently sloping and
amenable to farming and livestock raising; and
(3) the uplands are traversed by a network of
early roads and are close to the town of Tatum.
Not reflected in the site densities but relevant
to the slightly different histories of the two
project areas are the facts that one of the most
important mid-nineteenth-century transportation routes, Trammel’s Trace, passed through
the middle of Area V and that much of Area W,
i.e., all of the Thomas O’Bar Survey, was held
by nonresident landowners until the latter part
of the nineteenth century and then subdivided.
One result of this is that early historic sites are
relatively well represented in Area V, while most
of the historic sites in Area W are later.
Viewed by itself, the prehistoric site density
in Area W is not much lower than that in the
parts of the Sabine Mine north of the Sabine
River (Table 4.2). But probably the more meaningful figure is the one for Areas W and V combined, since it conveys information for a single
large contiguous area. This density is much
lower than that for the surveyed area north of
the river. As noted by Dockall et al. (2010:228),
this probably relates at least partly to the fact
that the north side of the river is drained by a
number of perennial south-flowing tributaries
that create a multitude of ideal settings for
Native American occupation sites, while the
uplands south of the river are drained by intermittent streams. Hence, Native American
settlement strategies in this region, during some
time periods anyway, may have been tributary
oriented rather than river oriented.
The site density data from Martin Lake
Mine and Oak Hill Mine suggest that something
more may have been going on, though, with prehistoric sites being even scarcer in both of these
than in the Rusk Permit area (see Table 4.2).

ASSESSMENTS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
Prehistoric Components
The survey resulted in the discovery and
documentation of 44 prehistoric components.
Most of these clearly lack the capacity to yield
important information beyond that derived
from survey and shovel testing and are considered ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places under Criterion D
(Table 4.3). The most conspicuous of these are
the 31 lithic scatters (1 also yielded a single
ceramic sherd) in upland settings, both at the
valley margin and back from the valley wall.
Artifacts are so sparse at all of these sites that
it is highly unlikely that interpretable samples
of cultural materials could be obtained. The artifact density per positive shovel test evidences
the infrequency of artifacts, ranging from 1.0 to
3.3 and averaging 1.4; all but 3 of these compo217

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
important information about Native American
use of the project area.
Of the other 13 prehistoric components,
8 (41RK674, 41RK680, 41RK693, 41RK695,
41RK703, 41RK704, 41RK707, and 41RK729)
are judged to be potentially eligible for National
Register listing under Criterion D (have yielded,
or may be likely to yield, information important
in prehistory or history) but would need additional investigation for complete eligibility assessments. This additional investigation would
involve archeological testing to more fully gauge
their age, content (including preservation of
cultural features and organic materials suitable
for radiocarbon dating), and integrity.
Two of the potentially eligible sites
(41RK674 and 41RK693) are artifact scatters
where Caddo ceramics substantially outnumber lithics. Although midden deposits were not
identified at either site and both have low overall artifact densities (2.2 and 3.3 artifacts per
positive test), they appear to represent Caddo
occupations associated with the nearby mound
centers at the Hudnall-Pirtle, Lane Mitchell,
or Pine Tree Mound sites (4, 9, and 19 km to
the northeast). Sites such as these would have
functioned within settlement systems consisting
of a number of site types, including multifamily
villages, smaller residential hamlets, campsites,
and resource procurement and processing areas.
If interpretable components can be isolated,
these sites would contribute to a better understanding of those settlement systems. Both
are situated on the ends of upland interfluves
overlooking the valley wall and Cherokee Bayou
floodplain margin. Their locations would have

nents have densities of 2.5 or less. This is similar to the results of the survey in the adjacent
Rusk Permit Area V, where the artifact density
at ineligible prehistoric components averaged
fewer than 2.4 per test (Dockall et al. 2010:229).
The percentage of positive tests varies from
site to site (6–69 percent) but on average is low
(26 percent). This is, once again, similar to the
28 percent average of positive shovel tests at
similar sites in Rusk Permit Area V (Dockall et
al. 2010:229). Combined, just 23 percent of the
tests contained artifacts. At least six (41RK672,
41RK675, 41RK677, 41RK696, 41RK705, and
41RK725) have been substantially disturbed by
logging, erosion, and construction of well pads,
roads, pipelines, and erosion-control features.
Twenty components yielded only lithic debitage; 3 have biface fragments in addition to
debitage (with 1 of these also having a sherd);
4 have ground or battered stone artifacts along
with flaking debris; and 4 have single projectile
points as well as flakes. These points—2 Friley
arrow points, 1 Bonham arrow point, and 1 untyped arrow point—suggest that some of these
lithic scatters date to the Woodland and Early
Caddo periods, although occupations of other
ages are possible too. Other than this and the
obvious conclusion that they represent ephemeral use, these sites are largely uninterpretable.
Given the nature of the archeological remains
and their context, the scarcity of temporally
diagnostic artifacts, and the general lack of
dateable organic materials, isolating components at these sites and dating them confidently
would be problematic, if not impossible. With
these limitations, they are judged not to contain

provided views of the floodplain and access to a
variety of environmental niches such as upland
forest, floodplains, streams, and relatively level
land for agricultural pursuits; hence, their setting suggests they served as small residential
sites, or perhaps campsites associated with
resource procurement or processing.
Another potentially eligible site, 41RK695,
is the only site in the uplands proper that has
a chance of having an interpretable Caddo
component. Although the recovered assemblage

is small, it does include four plain prehistoric
ceramic sherds (along with six lithic artifacts),
which might indicate an Early Caddo component connected to the Hudnall-Pirtle site. Like
41RK674 and 41RK693 above, it has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of
Caddo settlement systems. It is on a north-trending interfluve summit adjacent to a broad wetland area where two streams meet, well back
from the valley wall. This setting and the low
artifact density (2.0 per positive test) suggest
220

Chapter 4: Results of the Archeological Survey
The other five floodplain sites appear to
have less potential to contribute important
information and are considered ineligible for
National Register listing. The chief reason for
this is that they are sparse lithic scatters, with
shovel tests recovering only debitage at three
of them, debitage and a ground stone at one,
and debitage and a Kent dart point at the fifth.
Given the nature of the archeological remains,
the scarcity of temporally diagnostic artifacts,
and the lack of dateable organic materials,
isolating components at these sites and dating
them would be problematic. Hence, they are
poorer candidates for contributing information
useful for understanding Native American use
of the floodplain environment than the other five
floodplain sites discussed above.

that it might be a campsite related to resource
procurement or processing activities. With the
surface sands generally being less than 40 cm
thick, it could contain preserved matrix-defined
features such as postholes and pits.
The other 10 prehistoric components are
on the floodplain of Cherokee Bayou. Five of
these appear to have some potential for important information and thus are potentially
eligible for National Register listing. These
five (41RK680, 41RK703, 41RK704, 41RK707,
and 41RK729) are spread along the length
of the floodplain east-west and represent a
range of landform settings. Sites 41RK680,
41RK703, 41RK704 and 41RK707 occupy areas
of slightly higher topography fairly close to
the main channel of Cherokee Bayou, with
41RK680 and 41RK707 encompassing levee
deposits. Site 41RK729 is farther away from
the main channel close to the intersection of a
north-trending tributary channel and adjacent
small wetland. No instances of archeological
remains within stratified Holocene alluvium
were observed in shovel tests at these sites,
but it is possible that such contexts could be
present, particularly on the lower margins of
some of the landforms. If so, it may be comparatively easy to isolate components in some areas.
Three sites (41RK680, 41RK707, and 41RK729)
yielded small numbers of Caddo sherds, and
a fourth (41RK704) had an untypeable arrow
point indicating that it probably also has a
Caddo component. Site 41RK703 did not have
any temporally diagnostic artifacts, but given
the setting and the findings at the other sites,
it likely also has materials relating to Caddo
occupations. Hence, like 41RK674, 41RK693,
and 41RK695 discussed above, these sites
appear to have the potential to contribute to
a better understanding of Caddo settlement
systems, particularly that associated with the
Early Caddo ceremonial center at the HudnallPirtle site on the Sabine River just 2.9–5.2 km
to the northeast. The setting of these sites, i.e.,
on low floodplain rises, suggests they were not
suitable for year-round occupation, and the
generally low artifact densities (1.2–2.6 per
positive test, except at 41RK704 with an unusually high value of 9.0) are consistent with
this interpretation. Hence, these sites may been
used as short-term campsites or procurement/
processing locations associated with exploitation of the surrounding floodplain.

Historic Components
All 33 historic archeological components
are considered ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places (see
Table 4.3). Most are farmsteads or probable
farmsteads that, based on the archeological
evidence and historic aerial photographs,
date entirely to the twentieth century (n = 21;
41RK676, 41RK679, 41RK682, 41RK684,
41RK688, 41RK696–41RK702, 41RK710,
41RK716, 41RK718, 41RK720, 41RK722,
4RK723, 41RK727, 41RK730, and 41RK735).
Fourteen of these 21 were occupied at least late
as 1960, and most or all of the others probably
were used into the 1940s. The recent ages of
these sites and in many cases the presence of
essentially modern remains indicate that they
are poor candidates for containing important
archeological information about the history
of the area. Further, 18 lack or have limited
structural remains and other features that
could provide information on site layout, and
16 have unknown associations, either because
they represent tenant occupations or it cannot
be determined if the archeological remains
represent occupations by tenants or owners. At
least 6 have been badly disturbed by well pads,
pipelines, logging, earthmoving, or erosion.
Nine components are farmsteads or
probable farmsteads that appear to date
partly or wholly to the nineteenth century
and that could potentially contain important
information about early settlement (41RK690,
41RK692, 41RK711, 41RK713, 41RK721,
221

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
The three ineligible components that are
not farmsteads are a mid-twentieth-century
barn (41RK694), a twentieth-century road
(41RK715), and a twentieth-century cemetery
(41RK724). Site 41RK694 lacks important archeological information because of its recent
(post-1960) age and limited agricultural function. Site 41RK715 lacks important information
because it is just one segment of a network of
roads that served the rural area northwest
of the town of Tatum during the first half of
the twentieth century; this network is better
documented on historic aerial photographs
and maps than in the archeological record.
Historic cemeteries like 41RK724, the Zion
Hill Cemetery first used early in the twentieth
century and still in use today, generally are not
considered eligible for listing in the National
Register because “for profoundly personal
reasons, familial and cultural descendants
of the interred often view graves and cemeteries with a sense of reverence and devout
sentiment that that can overshadow objective
evaluation,” unless they meet special Criteria
Considerations A–G (Potter and Boland 1992:1,
14–18). Site 41RK724 does not meet these requirements. Cemeteries such as this one are
protected by state laws, though.

41RK732–41RK734, and 41RK736), but that
are judged ineligible for National Register listing for various reasons. In two cases (41RK692
and 41RK713), this is because they appear to
have been occupied by tenants, and thus their
associations are unknown. Sites 41RK732 and
41RK734 could have been occupied by any of
a succession of owners, and thus their associations also are unknown; further, they are
extremely sparse, disturbed artifact scatters
lacking structural remains or other cultural
features. Site 41RK711 also had a series of
owners in the nineteenth century, some of whom
are known to have lived elsewhere; as such,
its associations are unknown. In three cases
(41RK690, 41RK721, and 41RK733), the sites
were occupied until the middle of the twentieth
century, making it extremely unlikely that their
nineteenth-century components could be isolated for interpretation. Finally, 41RK736 may
date to a restricted time span (1886–1916) and
is of known associations (the African American
Green Robertson family), but the site has only
a sparse scatter of artifacts, apparently lacks
structural remains or other cultural features
to provide a spatial context for interpretation,
and has been disturbed by well pad and pipeline
construction.

RESULTS OF THE HISTORICAL
RESOURCES SURVEY

5

SUMMARY OF THE RESOURCES

and 2000. The appendix to this report contains
historical resources survey forms with photographs, documenting these resources.
Domestic buildings and associated resources are the most common property type in the
study area and were built between about 1896
and ca. 2000. Those built before World War II
are best defined by various roof types; front- and
side-gable roofs are common. Patterned after
nineteenth-century folk housing, the front-gable
house (Resources 7, 32, 39B, and 39C) was popular with many rural residents, who seldom applied expensive stylized detailing more common
in urban areas. In the American South, front-gable houses are usually one-story, double-pile
buildings with low-pitched roofs (McAlester and
McAlester 2000:90). The side-gable roof form
(Resource 39A) has main entry on the façade
perpendicular to, instead of on, the gable end.
Side-gable houses are usually one-story and at
least two rooms deep, but vary in roof pitch and
porch configuration. Early versions are likely
to have a full-length shed porch, but those built
as late as the 1930s might have a small porch
or, in some cases, no porch at all (McAlester and
McAlester 2000:98). A few houses exhibit L-plan
(Resource 18A) or bungalow (Resources 21, 36,
and 42) forms. Post-World War II houses in the
study area are modest versions of contemporaneously popular stylistic influences—Minimal
Traditional, Minimal Ranch, and Ranch bungalows. Minimal Traditional design (Resources
3, 24–27, 34, 46, and 48), popular in the 1950s,
offers only the barest ornamentation that
mimics classical or colonial revival detailing.
Minimal Ranch houses (Resources 9, 35, 37, 41,
45, and 47) are a diminutive variation of Ranch
Style. Remarkably modest, these one-story

The prefield file search and literature
review indicated that no formally designated
properties existed in the study area and that several historic contexts apply to it. No resources in
the study area had National Historic Landmark,
National Register, Recorded Texas Historic
Landmark, or State Antiquities Landmark
designation. Prior to this survey, no resources
in the study area had been identified or documented as historic cemeteries, neighborhood
surveys, or Family Land Heritage farms recognized by the Texas Department of Agriculture,
and none had undergone Historic American
Buildings Survey, Historic American Landscape,
or Historic American Engineering Record recordation. No resources in the study area had
local historic designation. Appropriate historic
contexts gleaned from the literature review for
this study area are agriculture, ethnic heritage
(African American), and industry.
The study area is rural, dotted with small
farms and oil and gas development. Much of the
road system has been in place since the early
twentieth century, with late-twentieth- and
early-twenty-first-century houses built along
State Highway 149, which was not constructed
until the 1950s. In addition to oil- and gas-related resources, intermittent modern features
noted on the landscape include feed troughs
and deer blinds.
Reconnaissance survey identified and documented 67 historic-age resources in the study
area (Table 5.1; Figure 5.1). The resources consist of 41 domestic, 16 agricultural, 6 industrial,
2 religious, 1 funerary, and 1 transportation
property types constructed between about 1882

rectangular houses were an outgrowth of older
double-pile cottages that could readily engage
popular modern styles. A low-pitched gable or
hip roof is common. Minimal Ranches typically
do not have garages integrated into the dwelling
(Jakle et al. 1989:187–188, 218). Ranch bungalow houses (Resources 10A, 40, 43, and 44) were
initially designed to force a modern residential
form onto a narrow lot, but were popular in rural
settings where space allowed the wider façade
to face the main street. These one-story rectangular houses have a bungalow floor plan, a lowpitched front-gable or hip roof, and sometimes
incised corner porches and an integrated garage
(Jakle et al. 1989:193–194, 200). Domestic out-

buildings have no distinguishable style and are
classified by roof type. Three domestic outbuildings (Resources 38C–D and 39D) each have a
shed roof, and another (Resource 10B) has a
front-gable roof. Wells (Resources 6 and 17) and a
cistern (Resource 38E), also domestic resources,
are modest landscape features. These domestic
resources are commonplace, without distinction,
and possess no special attributes. The houses
have experienced alterations to fenestration
patterns, replacement of original windows, doors,
siding, or porch components with modern materials, and nonhistoric additions. No individual
resource is exemplary of a style, type, period, or
method of construction, and none have strong

RECOMMENDATIONS

associations with important historical trends,
events, or people.
Agricultural resources in the study area
consist of barns (Resources 13, 18B, 23B, and
38H), livestock tanks (Resources 2, 14A, 16,
and 28), outbuildings (Resources 20A–D),
corrals (Resources 14B, 31, 38F), and a feed
trough (Resource 38G) built between about
1911 and 1970. The ca. 1911 Kinsey farmstead
barn (Resource 18B and 41RK699) is ruinous,
and several others are in poor condition. Four
outbuildings (Resources 20A–D) were built of
historic materials or moved to their present
location in about 2000. Several are less than
50 years old. These agricultural resources are
commonplace, without distinction, and possess
no special attributes. No individual resource is
exemplary of a style, type, period, or method
of construction, and none have strong associations with important historical trends, events,
or people.
The study area includes industrial properties and transportation properties. Industrial
properties are natural gas wells (Resources
1, 4, and 5), a natural gas transmission line
(Resource 12), a natural gas gathering pipeline
(Resource 33), and an electric transmission
line (Resource 11). The ca. 1882 Longview
and Sabine Valley Railway (Resource 22) is a
transportation property. These resources are
in their original locations but have undergone
routine maintenance that required the replacement of numerous original components
with nonhistoric parts. No individual resource
is exemplary of a style, type, period, or method
of construction, and none have strong associations with important historical trends, events,
or people.
The Original Zion Hill Baptist Church
(Resource 30A), a related outbuilding (Resource
30B), and the associated cemetery (Resource
30C) represent religious and funerary properties
in the study area. Although the congregation
dates to at least 1901, the current building and
outbuilding were probably constructed in about
1970. It has known associations with the local
community, but the cemetery does not include
graves of transcendent importance or distinctive
design features. These religious and funerary
resources are commonplace, without distinction,
and possess no special attributes. They are not
exemplary of a style, type, period, or method of
construction.

After synthesizing the research and field
investigations, project personnel evaluated
each historic-age resource to assess its National
Register eligibility. To be eligible, historic properties, i.e., buildings, structures, objects, sites,
or districts, would need to meet the National
Register criteria for evaluation. These criteria
call for properties considered eligible to be significant for historical associations with events
or broad patterns in history (Criterion A), persons (Criterion B), architecture (Criterion C), or
prehistoric or historic archeology (Criterion D)
(Andrus and Shrimpton 2002). To the extent
possible given the limited secondary research
allocated for reconnaissance-level contextual
documentation, resources were evaluated under
Criterion A or B when associative qualities
were obvious. Each historic-age resource was
also evaluated under Criterion C. Criterion D,
reserved for historic and prehistoric archeological resources, is applied in Chapter 4 to those
resources that have archeological components.
For each of the criterion, historic-age resources
were evaluated within the historic contexts of
agriculture, ethnic heritage (African American),
and industry.
Registration requirements applied to this
study area guided examination of each resource’s
integrity, which informed recommendations regarding eligibility for the National Register. For
resources to be considered eligible, they would
need to be 50 years of age or older and retain historical and architectural authenticity, best articulated by the seven aspects of integrity: location,
setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling,
and association (Andrus and Shrimpton 2002).
Resources in this study area that could be
considered eligible under Criterion A or B would
have to be associated with events or broad patterns in history or persons affiliated with those
activities. Although it is necessary to consider the
architectural and physical integrity for resources evaluated under Criterion A or B, attributes
of historical integrity are more highly valued for
these criteria. Thus, the most important aspects
of integrity for evaluating resources under these
criteria are location, feeling, and association.
Resources evaluated under these criteria must
also be assessed with respect to their integrity
of setting, design, materials, and workmanship
231

Surveys of 4,392 Acres in the Rusk Permit, Area W
but are not held to as high a standard for these
physical attributes. Although strong candidates
likely would offer good representation of each
of the seven aspects of integrity, at a minimum,
resources eligible under Criterion A or B must
be in their original location and retain much of
their historic fabric, including building footprint,
fenestration pattern, and character-defining
details. These resources may have undergone
one or more nonhistoric changes that would be
acceptable if intrinsic features remain intact.
Those that have accumulated more than one
change, causing a higher percentage of loss
to original historic fabric and design, are less
likely to be eligible. Also less likely to be eligible are resources that have experienced major
changes such as altered fenestration patterns,
unsympathetic additions, or loss of important
historic components. Those that are in poor
physical condition or were moved from their
original location and setting are not likely to be
eligible. Historic-period changes are acceptable.
Resources evaluated as eligible under Criterion
A or B should retain notable integrity of feeling,
best accomplished with an intact setting that
conveys information about the applicable period
of significance. Integrity of association must be
present with archival evidence that relates information about how the resource, or its owner
or occupant, was affiliated with specific events
or patterns pertinent to the applicable historic
context. None of the resources in this study
area meet these requirements, and thus none
are recommended as eligible for the National
Register under Criteria A or B.
Resources that could be considered eligible
under Criterion C are those that embody the distinctive characteristics of a style, type, period, or
method of construction, and may be representative or rare examples of such. Although it is necessary to consider the historical significance and
integrity of resources evaluated under Criterion
C, attributes of architectural significance and
physical integrity are more highly valued for this
criterion. Thus, the most important aspects of integrity for evaluating resources under this criterion are location, setting, design, materials, and
workmanship. Resources evaluated under this
criterion must also be assessed with respect to
their integrity of feeling and association but are
not held to as high a standard for these less-tangible attributes. Architectural significance and
integrity are evaluated by comparing these re-

sources to others of like stylistic influence, type,
period, or method of construction in and near the
study area. Resources eligible under Criterion
C should remain in their original location and
retain their historic-period setting. They should
have experienced no or few intrusive alterations
that permanently modify their design, materials,
or workmanship. Consequently, they should be
exemplary of their style, type, period, or method
of construction and retain character-defining
features associated with these physical aspects
of integrity. Historic-period changes are acceptable. Integrity of feeling is best accomplished
with an intact setting that conveys information
about the applicable period of significance.
Integrity of association must be present with an
explanation that relates how a resource exudes
representation or rarity of style, type, period, or
method of construction. None of the resources
in this study area meet these requirements, and
thus none are recommended as eligible for the
National Register under Criterion C.
Based on research and an examination of
the distribution of historic-age resources, no
potential historic districts or landscapes associated with local agricultural, ethnic (African
American), or industrial history are in or near
the study area. The overriding premise for this
recommendation is the lack of a unified or interconnected collection of resources that could be
considered contributing elements to a potential
historic district or landscape. Although agriculture is still a mainstay of the local economy, its
focus has changed from row crops to pastureland and from large operations to small-scale
“ranchettes.” By the late twentieth century, local
agricultural and land use practices had changed
considerably from cash-crop production to livestock raising, to the extent that it was unlikely
to expect historic-age agricultural resources and
landscape features to be extant, much less retain
their historic-period functions or integrity. The
introduction of modern oil-related equipment
in the study area further impedes the potential
for a rural setting to convey historic land use
practices. Archival evidence indicates the presence of numerous slaves and their houses in
the antebellum era and that of freedmen in the
postbellum era. However, no collection of buildings or structures associated with an African
American ethnic heritage context are extant in
the study area. Archival evidence also indicates
the potential for historic districts or landscapes
232

Chapter 5: Results of the Historical Resources Survey
associated with the local oil industry, but no
groupings of associated resources were found
during fieldwork. Collectively, the resources in
this study area offer neither exemplary nor typical groupings that replicate historic agricultural
practices, ethnic heritage, or industry. Extant
historic-age resources and landscape features,
both in and near the study area, do not provide
enough historic fabric to adequately portray
integrity of setting, feeling, or association that
would be necessary for a historic district or landscape associated with any of these contexts, and

as a result, no historic districts or landscapes
are present.
In conclusion, this reconnaissance survey
of buildings, structures, and sites identified
and documented 67 historic-age resources in
the study area. None of these are eligible for
listing in the National Register. Further, no
potential historic districts were identified in
the study area. Since all resources identified are
recommended as not eligible for the National
Register, no further work is required for historical resources.
