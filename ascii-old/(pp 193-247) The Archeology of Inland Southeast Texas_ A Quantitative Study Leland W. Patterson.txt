The Archeology of Inland Southeast Texas:
A Quantitative Study
Leland IV. Patterson

ABSTRACT
This sunanaary of the archeology of Inland Southeast Texas is based on
computerized data base information from 182 published sites, and provides an
overview of the current status of research on the prehistory of this subregion. Many
of the conclusions are the same as in previous studies, but they are now supported
more fully by quantitative data.

INTRODUCTION

It has been noted (Patterson 1988a) that the published data base for the
archeology of Southeast Texas is now sufficiently large to support detailed studies
and summaries of this region and its subregions. Unless the total published data base
is used, resulting studies will be more impressionistic than rigorous. This is a
quantitative summary of the archeology of Inland Southeast Texas, using a
computerized data base and all of the generally available published literature for
archeological sites in the subregion.
Inland Southeast Texas as defined here covers 21 counties (Figure 1), the same
area used previou sly by the author for sum mary articles (Patterson 1979a, 1983) and
a bibliographic series (Patterson 1986a) for Southeast Texas as a whole. Coastal
margin sites, mainlyRangia shell middens, are not included in this current data base,
but a separate data base for coastal margin sites may be developed in the future.
For the study of geographic distributions of artifact types, Inland Southeast
Texas has been divided into three zones.
Eastern Zone: San Jacinto, Liberty, Chambers, Polk, Hardin, Jefferson,
Jasper, Newton, Orange, and Tyler counties.
Central Zone: Grimes, Walker, Montgomery, Harris, and Galveston counties.
Western Zone: Wharton, Washington, Austin, Fort Bend, Brazoria, and
Waller counties.
The data base for this study covers 182 published sites. A breakdown of sites
by county can be made for 16 of the 21 counties (Table 1), but there are no
publications for Inland type sites in Chambers, Galveston, Jefferson, Newton, and
Orange counties, all of which border the coastal margin. There are 52 published sites
in the Western Zone, 95 in the Central zone, and 35 in the Eastern Zone. The
publications cover 43 excavated sites, 9 sites with data from both excavation and
surface collections, and 130 sites with data only from surface collections.

Every county in this subregion has some recorded sites for which no details
have been published, so there is a need for more publication of recorded sites that
have enough diagnostic data to justify publication; recorded archeological sites are
often identified only by nondiagnostic materials such as chert flakes.
It can be seen (Table 1) that there has been no uniformity in archeological work
in Inland Southeast Texas; the need for uniformity should be considered when
planning future regional research. The pattern of archeological work in this
subregion is a result of somewhat random selection; that pattern reflects where sites
have been discovered, where contract archeology covering construction projects
has been performed, and where members of the Houston Archeological Society
have been able to do work.
The literature on Inland Southeast Texas has grown to a level where it is no
longer possible to rely on memory or on a few published examples for research
conclusions. For many archeological subjects in this geographic area, the entire
body of published literature should be considered quantitatively; this approach
requires tabulation of data. Once the decision has been made to tabulate large

amounts of data, the necessity for use of a computer is obvious. More time is
required to enter data into a computer than would be needed simply to do a
manual tabulation, but the computer data base has the advantage of making it
possible (1) to produce new summaries easily, with revised and additional data,
(2) to make complex queries quickly and easily, and (3) to make final printed
tabulations easily.
Some summary articles have been published on the overall archeology of
Southeast Texas (Patterson 1979a, 1983), but only the coastal margin of this
region has been the subject of a detailed study (Aten 1983). This paper strives
to make a detailed summary of the archeology of Inland Southeast Texas generally available.
The available data indicate that Inland Southeast Texas has been occupied for
about 12,000 years, and detailed archeological data are available for occupation
sequences dating since about 10,000 years ago in this subregion. The entire
prehistory of Inland Southeast Texas is of a hunting and gathering lifeway.
Technological changes occurred within this framework, but a rather stable settlement
pattern seems to have been established.

Data are now available for the study of several topics relating to the archeology of Inland Southeast Texas: chronology, technological change, geographical distribution of artifact types, settlement patterns, and subsistence patterns.
Some investigators tend to favor use of data from excavated sites, but all data
from both excavated sites and surface collections must be considered if studies
are to be complete.
This summary of data synthesizes several subjects for published sites in Inland
Southeast Texas, but the detailed tabulation of data from each site and a corresponding publication list are too large for inclusion here. A separate report with a complete
printout of the detailed data base will be published separately as a report of the
Houston Archeological Society.
METHODOLOGY AND DATA BASE

This study has used all of the generally available published literature on
archeological sites in this subregion. Some contract archeology reports have not
been considered, since they are not always readily available. It would be useful if
detailed absWacts of scientific data from contract archeology work were generally
available (Patterson 1979b), since archeological data that are not generally available are essentially lost data. Even though unpublished site data from the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) files were used for a previous summary of the Southeast Texas region (Patterson 1979a:Table 1), only published data
are included in this study, since unpublished data generally do not contain enough
detail to warrant the effort of tabulation. In any event, a substantial data base has
been developed for this study.
Use of a computerized data base is ideal for this type of investigation; in this
specific case, the Paradox relational data base program has been used with an IBM
50Z computer (a computer with a bard disk is advisable for this type of work). A
relational data base allows linking of tables for complex queries; archeological site
numbers are the link between tables in this specific data base.
The computerized data base used here has 12 tables: basic site data, projectile
points (3 tables), ceramics, radiocarbon dates, lithic tools, general lithics, terrestrial
faunal remains, aquatic faunal remains, miscellaneous artifacts and features, and
mortuary data. Noncomputerized tabulation has been used for some artifact types
with low frequencies.
CHRONOLOGY ANDDEMOGRAPHY

The chronological periods used here are those used in a previous regional
summary (Patterson 1979a). A few radiocarbon dates are available, but, in general,
time periods have been established for each site on the basis of key projectile point
and ceramic types. The small amount of data on the Early Paleoindian period has
been discussed previously (Patterson 1979a, 1983) and will not be considered
further here. This paper is concerned mainly with the details of the archeology of

Pattersonmlnland Southeast Texas

259

about 10,000 years in this subregion, from the start of the Late Paleoindian period
until the start of the Historic Indian period.
The Late Paleoindian period is represented by San Patrice, Early Notched,
Early Stemmed, Angostura, Plainview, Meserve, and Scottsbluff dart points. The
Early Archaic period is represented by Carrollton, Trinity, and Bell points. The
Middle Archaic is represented by Bulverde and Pedernales points, although some
Gary and Kent points are also present. The Late Archaic and Early Ceramic
periods share several projectile point types, including Gary, Kent, Ellis, Ensor,
Yarbrough, Palmillas, and Darl. A few sites have Goose Creek Stamped pottery
from the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983:Figure 14.1); the Early Ceramic period
in this region is represented by dart points and ceramics but no bifacial arrowpoints (unifacial arrowpoints may be present). The Late Prehistoric period has
ceramics and bifacial arrowpoints, and some Historic Indian sites have glass and
metal artifacts. For many of the published sites, estimates of time periods involved are those of the authors. A summary of projectile points for each time
period already has been published (Patterson 1983:Table 1).
A summary of chronological data shows the time ranges and number of sites
in Inland Southeast Texas for each time period, and a relative population factor is
shown for each time period (Table 2). The relative population factor is the number
of sites in a time period divided by the number of years in a period times 100 (Figure
2). The results for Inland Southeast Texas are similar to those of a previous study
(Patterson 1986b) that used another data set, showing a rapid population increase
in the Late Archaic and Early Ceramic periods and some population decrease in the
Late Prehistoric. A complete explanation of population dynamics in this region has
not yet been developed, but the relative population data given here are more
complete than those in the previous study patterson 1986b) because data are now
available for the Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods.

Settlement Patterns

It has been known for some time that most prehistoric sites in Inland Southeast
Texas were along the banks of streams and small lakes, and that the number of sites
with occupation components in multiple time periods evidence stable settlement
patterns in this subregion over long periods of time ~atterson 1983).
For 16 sites in this study, occupation components have been identified for
all time periods from Late Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric. This number increases
to 27 if sites where the Early Archaic period is not f’mnly identified are included.
Only 49 sites (27 percent) of the 182 sites in this study represent only a single
time period, and more than half of the sites (73 percent) have occupation components from two or more time periods. These data indicate that there were stable
settlement patterns with repeated use of sites in this region, in spite of the fact
that prehistoric Indians here were generally nomadic.
Radiocarbon Dates

As noted above, most of the chronological placement of artifact types for Inland
Southeast Texas is based on excavated artifact sequences and the chronology of
artifact types in adjacent regions. Because of the small amount of data available on
absolute dates for this subregion, only broad-range chronological periods have been
considered. The starting dates for pottery and standardized bifacial arrowpoint
types in Inland Southeast Texas are based on radiocarbon dating from sites on the
coastal margin (Aten 1983).

Most radiocarbon dates published for Inland Southeast Texas are from counties
in the Western Zone (Table 3), and these few radiocarbon dates do cover the
complete time range of the Late Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric periods.
In general, chronological placement of artifact types found in radiocarbon-dated
excavated levels has been consistent with previous estimates of the time periods
involved (Patterson 1983:Table 1). Radiocarbon dates in Table 3 for site 41PK69
were added after other summaries were made, so this site is not included in the
general statistics.

There is an obvious need for more radiocarbon dating in this subregion in
order to refine chronological sequences. This should be an important goal to be
considered in planning regional research. Excavation of more well-stratified sites

262

Texas Archeological Society

is needed for establishment of more detailed chronological sequences, but,
unfortunately, well-stratified sites are not common in this subregion.
Projectile Points
Data for Early Paleoindian Clovis and Folsom projectile point types are not
considered in this paper because only a few specimens have been found in Inland Southeast Texas. A summary of Clovis point data has been published for
the overall region (patterson 1986c), and only one Folsom point has been reported (Patterson et al. 1987). The possibility of notched projectile points starting in the Early Paleoindian period has also been noted previously (Patterson
and Hudgins 1985; Patterson et al. 1987). There is now a significant published
data base for projectile point types in Inland Southeast Texas for all time periods after about 10,000 years ago, and a summary of these data is presented below.
Inland Southeast Texas has been divided into three zones for this study
(Figure 1) because, as previously noted, there are east-west gradients in the
concentrations of some projectile point types (patterson 1983:Table 1, 1988b).
Data summarized here show significant concentration gradients for geographical distributions of projectile point types in all prehistoric time periods. Inland
Southeast Texas is a border area for technological traditions of the southern Great
Plains and the woodlands of the Southeast (Jennings 1974:Figure 1.1).
The geographical distributions of early dart point types in this region (Table
4) shows that the Great Plains Paleoindian tradition is represented by Plainview,
Angostura, Scottsbluff, and Meserve points; there is a definite east-west gradient for concentrations of Plainview and Angostura points. As would be expected,
the highest concentrations of these point types are in the west. The eastern
Paleoindian tradition is represented by San Patrice and Early Notched points;
there is a decrease in frequency of San Patrice points to the west, and the frequency of Early Notched points seems to decrease eastward, a fact that is unexpected for this essentially eastern point type. This paradox may be due to the
fact that the Early Notched point type has only recently been recognized in Inland
Southeast Texas (patterson and Hudgins 1985). Not much data is available for
the distribution of Early Stemmed points, although this point type seems to occur
with a higher frequency to the west in this region.
Webb, Shiner, and Roberts (1971) have shown that San Patrice and Early
Notched points are found at the same site in Louisiana. In Inland Southeast Texas,
35 percent of sites with San Patrice points also have Early Notched points.
In the Early Archaic period, the Bell point of Central Texas is found in the
Western and Central Zones of Inland Southeast Texas. Carrollton and Trinity
points are found most frequently in the Central Zone, and the Wells point has a
fairly uniform geographic distribution in this region.
In the Middle Archaic period, the Pedernales point of Central Texas is also
found in Inland Southeast Texas with a significant east-west concentration gradient. As expected, most Pedernales points are found in the western half of Inland

Southeast Texas. Determination of the dislxibution of Bulverde and Bulverdelike points in the Middle Archaic period poses a problem. As previously noted
(Patterson 1988b), Bulverde-like points in Inland Southeast Texas may have
evolved from classic Bulverde morphology, with Bulverde-like points often
lacking the diagnostic wedge-shaped stem. Since the attributes of Bulverde and
Bulverde-like points overlap, a definite conclusion cannot be made at this time
on the geographic distributions of these similar point types in Inland Southeast
Texas.
Morhiss and Williams points seem to occur during some parts of the Middle
and Late Archaic periods in Inland Southeast Texas. The Williams point has a
fairly uniform distribution throughout this region, but data on the Morhiss point
are insufficient to support any conclusions.

264

Texas Areheological Society

The distributions of later dart point types (Table 5) show that the Late Archaic
period is represented by several dart point types in Inland S outheast Texas. Gary and
Kent points are major types for this period, but do not have much value for
chronological placement, since they were made from the Middle Archaic through
the Late Prehistoric (Hall 1981; Patterson 1983). Later Gary and Kent points tend
to be smaller (Patterson 1980); they are distributed throughout this region, but are
somewhat more numerous in the Eastern and Central Zones. Gary and Kent points
form a series with overlapping attributes. Eighty percent of published sites with
Kent points also have Gary points, and 66 percent of sites with Gary points also have
Kent points.
Several other dart point types tend to be found with Gary and Kent points
in the Late Archaic and Early Ceramic periods, including Ellis, Ensor, Palmillas,
Yarbrough, and Darl types. Seventy-seven percent of sites with Yarbrough points,
74 percent of sites with Palmillas points, 74 percent of sites with Ellis points, 71

percent of sites with Ensor points, and 77 percent of sites with Darl points also
have Gary and Kent points.
In the Late Archaic and Early Ceramic periods, several Central Texas dart
point types that are found in the Western and Central Zones of Inland Southeast
Texas, including Travis, Marcos, and Fairland types, have not been found in the
Eastern Zone. Several Louisiana dart point types from the Late Archaic are found
in Inland Southeast Texas. Evans and Motley points are found only in the Eastern Zone. The Pontchartrain point occurs mainly in the Eastern Zone, but a few
specimens have been found in the Central and Western Zones.
Uniform classification of dart point types has caused this study a few problems, since published reports reflect the judgment of the individual investigators. In a few cases, obvious misclassifications have been corrected. Also, I am
a "lumper" not a "splitter" for projectile point classification. For this study,
Dawson points have been reclassified as Kent, Neches River side-notched as
Ensor, Godley have been reclassified as Yarbrough, and Shumla have been reclassified as Bell. Classification of projectile point types here is generally consistent with previous classification studies (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Turner and
Hester 1985).
Bifacial arrowpoints represent the Late Prehistoric and Historic Indian periods, although unifacial arrowpoints do occur earlier (Patterson 1980). A summary of arrowpoint distributions in Inland Southeast Texas (Table 6) shows that
the chronologies of various arrowpoint types are poorly known. Radiocarbon
dates establish the appearance of bifacial arrowpoints at about A.D. 600 (Aten
1983:306) in this region, but excavations (Patterson 1980) and surface collections (Patterson 1982) show that unifacial arrowpoints do occur significantly
earlier; Cuney and Bulbar Stem arrowpoints have been associated with Historic
Indian sites (Hudgins 1982).
As noted previously (Patterson 1986d), data from excavations show that
Perdiz points, especially numerous in the Central and Eastern Zones (Table 6),
were the dominant arrowpoint type throughout the Late Prehistoric in Inland
Southeast Texas. Other arrowpoint types were used at some time in the Late
Prehistoric in this region. The Scallorn arrowpoint, an early Central Texas
arrowpoint type, was introduced to Inland Southeast Texas sometime after the
Perdiz point. Scallorn points are found in much smaller numbers than the Perdiz
point in Inland Southeast Texas. As expected, the Scallorn point has an eastwest concentration gradient in this region, with the highest concentration to the
west. Fresno, Edwards, Cuney, and Bulbar Stem arrowpoints also have distribution gradients with highest concentrations to the west in this region.
Some arrowpoints have highest frequencies to the east, including Catahoula,
Alba, Bonham, and Bassett. Friley, Colbert, Livermore, Washita, and Maud
arrowpoints have been found only in the Eastern Zone; the Livermore classification in a published report is problematical.
The geographical areas of distribution of distinctive functional artifact types
such as projectilepoint and ceramic types represent areas of influence of technological

traditions not necessarily tied to limited social groups. The outer geographical
boundaries of the distribution of a technological tradition can be influenced by
variables such as cultural preferences, movements of groups, trade, and transfer of
band members. In any event, the distribution gradients for the concentrations of
artifact types in Inland Southeast Texas seem to reflect increasing or decreasing
influences of different technological traditions, sometimes even representing
Southeastern or southern Great Plains influences. Some technological traditions
can have wide geographic distributions--e.g., the Clovis point tradition found
throughout most of the United States or the San Patrice-Hardaway Late Paleoindian
point tradition found throughout the entire southeastern United States (Justice
1987:Map 14).

Ceramics
A summary of distributions of ceramic types in Inland Southeast Texas (Table
7) shows that ceramic types are not too useful for establishing chronological
sequences in this subregion. Aten (1983 Figure 14.1) has published a ceramic type
sequence for the Galveston Bay area that has only limited use for Inland studies; the
ceramic classification used here generally follows Aten’s (1983) typologies.
Goose Creek Plain sandy paste pottery is the dominant type in all zones of
Inland Southeast Texas. This type was probably made throughout the entire time
span of ceramics in this region (see Aten 1983:Figure 14.1). Goose Creek Incised

pottery is not common, at about I percent ofaU Goose Creek pottery, and a few sites
have Conway pottery, which is like Goose Creek except that it has coarse sand. On
at least some sites, there is a question as to whether the coarse sand was intentionally
added as temper or occurred naturally in the clay. A few sherds of Goose Creek
Stamped pottery, which Aten (1983:Figure 14.1) classifies as an Early Ceramic
period type, have been found in the Central Zone.
Rockport Plain (with or without asphalt coating) and Rockport Asphalt
Decorated pottery are found in significant quantities at a few sites in the Western Zone of Inland Southeast Texas. This seems to indicate occasional Inland
occupations by Indians from the adjacent coastal margin. A few asphalt coated
sherds have been classified as Rockport in the Central and Eastern Zones.
Bone-tempered pottery occurs in all zones but is not very common. At one
excavated site in Harris County (patterson 1980), bone tempered pottery seems
to appear in the Early Ceramic period, unlike the Galveston Bay area, where
bone tempered pottery is a Late Prehistoric type (Aten 1983:Figure 14.1).
San Jacinto grog (sherd) tempered pottery is not common at Inland sites in
this region, but it does occur in all zones. Aten classifies San Jacinto pottery as
a Late Prehistoric type on the coastal margin. Presence of this pottery type at a
few Inland sites may indicate occasional occupations of the Inland area by Indians from the coastal margin or, possibly, transfer of women to Inland groups.
San Jacinto Incised pottery is much less common than San Jacinto Plain. A few
sherds were found at sites in Austin, San Jacinto, and Polk counties that had
both grog and bone tempering.
A few sherds of early Tchefuncte and MarksviUe Stamped pottery types of
Louisiana have been found in Inland Southeast Texas. These are a possible indication of technological influences from Louisiana in the early days of potterymaking in Inland Southeast Texas. Marksville Stamped has been found only in
the Eastern Zone adjacent to Louisiana, and the two specimens of Tchefuncte
found in the Central Zone may not be correctly identified, since Tchefuncte is
classified mainly by the contorted consistency of the paste.
A few specimens of Caddo pottery types have been found at sites on the
northern edge of Inland Southeast Texas, mainly in Montgomery, Polk, and San
Jacinto counties, indicating that the northern edge of Inland Southeast Texas was
probably the southern limit of significant Caddo influences in the Late Prehistoric period.
It has been noted previously that Late Prehistoric sites tend to have less
pottery than Early Ceramic sites in Inland Southeast Texas (Patterson 1976,
1980). In this study, 21 sites with only Late Prehistoric components average 16
sherds per site compared to 210 sherds per site at 100 sites that have both Early
Ceramic and Late Prehistoric components. This is another indication that pottery was used less during the Late Prehistoric than during the Early Ceramic
period. The decline in the use of ceramics in the Late Prehistoric might be a
reflection of a more mobile lifestyle (Patterson 1979a, 1983).

Lithic Tools
Formal chipped stone tool types are not numerous on most sites in Inland
Southeast Texas Cable 8); unretouched utilized flakes are the most common tools
in most lithic collections in this region. Only 30 percent of the 182 published sites
in the data base have scrapers, 12 percent have bifacial knives, 25 percent have
gravers, 10 percent have unifacial perforators, and 13 percent have bifacial
perforators (drills). Other formal tool types occur in even lower frequencies.
Inset blades (Table 8) may have been used as compound arrowpoint elements,
much as they were used in the Eurasian Mesolithic (Patterson 1982:19-22).

Combination scraper-gravers and stemmed scrapers tabulated here seem to
be associated with the Late Paleoindian period. Scraper-gravers are common in
Paleoindian lithic assemblages (Irwin and Wormington 1970) and were found
in the Late Paleoindian excavation levels of site 41WH19 in Wharton County
(Patterson et al. 1987). Webb, Shiner, and Roberts (1971) have reported stemmed
side-notched scrapers at a Late Paleoindian site in Louisiana, and a stemmed
side-notched scraper was found in the Late Paleoindian excavation level at Site
41FB42 in Fort Bend County (L. W. Patterson, notes).

Texas Archeological Society
General Lithics

A tabulation of general lithics from sites in Inland Southeast Texas (Table
9) shows that small flakes measure less than 15 mm~ and large flakes are over
15 mmL The main reason for tabulating lithic flakes here is to show that fewer
than half of the reports on sites in this subregion have quantitative data on lithic
flakes, making it clear that the details of lithic manufacturing are poorly reported
for many sites.

Large prismatic blades (more than 15 mm wide) are not numerous and seem
to be associated mainly with early occupation periods. Sixty-one percent of sites
with large blades have Paleoindian components.
As noted previously ~atterson 1973), several sites in this subregion have
industries for the manufacture of small prismatic blades (less than 15 mm wide).
Small prismatic blades can be made fortuitously as well as purposefully, but
many of the sites tabulated here have polyhedral blade cores as well as small
blades, thus demonstrating a purposeful manufacturing process. Small blades
were used to manufacture unifacial perforators, inset blades, unifacial arrowpoints (Patterson 1973, 1982), and sometimes blanks for the manufacture of
bifacial arrowpoints.
The main lithic raw materials in this region are chert cobbles and petrified
wood pieces found in the alluvial deposits in drainage basins of rivers such as

Patterson--Inland Southeast Texas

271

the Brazos; large numbers of chert cobbles and miscellaneous chert cores are
not found on most archeological sites in this subregion. General types of chert
cores were reported in only 19 percent of published sites, and chert cobbles were
reported in only 7 percent of published sites (Table 9). This indicates that primary reduction was commonly done at the source of the raw material, in order
to make the lithic materials easy to transport. Primary reduction at the source
also permitted testing for selection of high quality materials.
Heat treating of lithic materials to be used for the manufacture of dart points
was widespread. Only 24 percent of published sites showed that heat treating
was used, but many site reports did not consider heat treating at all. Heat treating may not have been used as much for petrified wood as it was for chert. The
area with the lowest incidence of heat treating (the Eastern zone) corresponds to
the area of highest use of petrified wood for dart points. Exotic flint from the
Edwards Plateau has been found in small quantities in a few sites.
Small numbers of hammerstones are found throughout this subregion. In
some cases, favorite hammerstones may have been curated by Indians and taken
from site to site. Most hammerstones are of quartzite, but a few are of limestone, which is a good material for use as a soft percussor for bifacial thinning.
Faunal Remains
Faunal preservation is generally poor at sites in Inland Southeast Texas, due
to acidic soil conditions. However, terrestrial faunal remains have been reported
at 44 sites (Table 10) and aquatic faunal remains at 26 sites (Table 11); there are
enough data to provide a fairly good picture of faunal subsistence patterns in
this subregion. As noted previously (Patterson 1983), Indians in the Southeast
Texas region were rather omnivorous, utilizing many types of small and large
animals, probably according to availability on a day-to-day basis. At a few sites
with freshwater shell middens, including site 41FB37 (McClure 1987), preservation of faunal remains has been good. However, preservation of floral remains
in this region is practically nonexistent.
Deer and turtle were the most commonly used faunal food resources; bison was
utilized when available. As Dillehay (1974) has noted, bison was generally
available only during certain times on the Southern Plains. Data from excavated
sites in this region support Dillehay’s statement (Wheat 1953; Patterson et al. 1987).
All data on faunal remains, from the earliest at 10,000 years ago (Patterson et al.
1987) to more recent times (Hall 1981) indicate a broad-based faunal subsistence
pattern over the entire period of prehistoric habitation of Inland Southeast Texas.
The use of freshwater shellfish is neither geographically nor chronologically uniform in this subregion. Apparently, availability of significant quantities of shellfish was limited to certain local areas and to certain time periods.
Along the San Bernard River, the greatest use of shellfish was during the Archaic period, with enough shell at some sites for classification as shell middens.
The oldest radiocarbon date for a shell midden in this area is 6690!-_120 years
BP (Patterson 1988c). Of the 22 sites with reported freshwater shellfish remains,

Zone.
Among other aquatic faunal resources used were alligator, pond turtle, frog,
and several types of fish. The shark teeth and stingray spines found at Inland sites
are from marine species of the coastal margin that were imported to Inland sites for
nonutilitarian uses.
Miscellaneous Artifacts and Features

Among the miscellaneous items from sites in Inland Southeast Texas (Table
12) are fired clayballs, found at 31 sites; clayballs formed definite hearth features at five sites. Purposely made clayballs generally are rounded and are uniformly fired on all surfaces. These artifacts, which are generally associated with
cooking, are found in sites in Inland Southeast Texas of all prehistoric time
periods (Patterson 1986e).
Hearths were reported at 12 sites in this subregion: five sites had hearth features
made of clayballs, three sites had stone hearths, one site had a hearth made of

clayballs and caliche pieces, and for hearths at three sites little specific information
is available except for the presence of baked soil and traces of charcoal. Hearths
made of clayballs were found in all zones, but hearths made of stone were found only
in the Western Zone, where there are outcrops of sandstone.
Pieces of asphalt, which were found at seven sites, occurring randomly in
all zones, were used to haft projectile points and to coat pottery. Sandstone pieces
that could have been used as abraders were found at 14 sites in all three zones.
At two other sites, sandstone pieces were definitely classified as abraders. In
addition, grooved stone pieces that are sometimes classified as shaft straighteners were reported at six sites. Manos were reported at nine sites, and metates
were reported at nine sites, but manos and metates were not always found together as complete grinding sets.
Ornamental items such as beads, pendants, and incised bone were found
most often at burial sites; five of the ~ven sites with beads were burial sites.
Three sites had bone beads, one site had shell beads, two sites had shell and
bone beads, and one site had shell and stone beads. The stone beads found at
one site (41FB42, L. W. Patterson, notes) were made of exotic materials.
Boatstones made of exotic materials were found at four burial sites, all in the
Western Zone. Incised bone objects were found at five sites in the Western Zone;
four of these sites had burials and the other site had a possible burial. Pendants
were found at seven sites, but shell pendants were found at only four burial

sites----one of these sites also had ground stone pendants (gorgets) made of exotic materials. One pendant was found at each of three sites that did not have
burials, made of chert, sandstone and bone.
Some types of artifacts are rather rare in this subregion. Four atlatl weights
(bannerstones) of exotic ground stone materials were found on three sites. Fishhooks and bone needles were found at one site, bone tools were reported at eight
sites, mad bone projectile points at three sites. The low frequency of functional
bone items is due at least in part to poor preservation.

Mortuary Data
The data on mortuary features at sites in this data base are not intended to
be used for detailed studies of mortuary practices in this region, but rather as a
general guide to the extent of data available on various burial types, locations,
and time periods for Inland Southeast Texas ~able 13). The computer data base
also has entries for burial configuration.

Most of the available mortuary data is for the Western Zone. Two small burial
groups have been reported in the Central Zone (Harris County) and one small burial
group has been reported in the Eastern Zone (Polk County). A singlepost-ceramic
burial has been reported at a site in the Western Zone (Wharton County). All other
burial data in the Western Zone are for multiple burials.
The only sites containing significant grave goods are in the Western Zone.
These sites are associated with an Archaic period burial tradition as noted by
Hall (1981) and Highley et al. (1988:Figure 1), involving elaborate grave goods,
often made of exotic materials. Hall (1981) has shown that grave goods decrease
significantly in post-ceramic burials. Grave goods from sites in the Archaic burial
tradition of the Western Zone include items such as large corner-tang bifaces,
boatstones, incised bone objects, shell, bone and stone beads, stone and shell
pendants, shark teeth, and stingray spines. The Western Zone burial tradition
implies a higher degree of social organization than is apparent in other zones in

276

Texas Archeological Society

Inland Southeast Texas. The only~other elaborate burial tradition in this region
is a postceramic tradition found on the coastal margin (Aten 1983). It could be
postulated that this higher degree of social organization was supported by its
location in an area of good natural food resources between the Colorado and
Brazos rivers.
EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS
Data for prehistoric external relationships of this subregion are of two types:
one type is a broad technological tradition such as projectile point and pottery
types; the other type is of a short-term nature and involves evidence of longrange exchange systems using exotic materials. Broadly distributed technological traditions have been discussed above, especially in relation to the Eastem
Woodlands and Southern Plains technological traditions.
Evidence for long-range exchange of materials within this region is found
mainly as grave goods of the Archaic burial tradition of the Western Zone. Shell
beads, shell pendants, shark teeth, and stingray spines are indications of contacts with the coastal margin. Hall (1981) has discussed the widespread geographic distribution of shell ornaments. The large comer-tang bifaces found in
the Western Zone seem to have come from Central Texas, which is the center
of concentration of this type of artifact (Turner and Hester 1985:210).
There is a possibility that ground stone objects found in the Western Zone
Archaic burial tradition represent part of the widespread Poverty Point Culture
exchange system described by Webb (1982:68). Boatstones, bannerstones, tubular stone beads, and stone gorgets found in the Western Zone are well known
artifact types in the Poverty Point Culture (Webb 1982:Figures 28, 29). The
Poverty Point Culture is well known for both long-range trade and a lapidary
manufacturing industry. It has been noted that the Poverty Point Culture has most
of the dart point types found in Inland Southeast Texas (Patterson 1975). Counter
exchange from Texas with the Poverty Point Culture may have involved lithic
raw materials and finished chipped stone items such as projectile points.
Bone fishhooks found at site 41AU1 in Austin County (Duke 1982:6) are
similar in both form and manufacturing methods to Archaic fishhooks found at
the Horn Shelter No. 2 site in Central Texas ~edder 1985:Figure 8).
Major river systems may have served as cultural exchange routes, promoting contacts between regions. Inland Southeast Texas has several major rivers
that run from the north or northwest: the Colorado, Brazos, San Jacinto, Trinity,
Neches, and Sabine rivers. The Colorado and Brazos river systems seem to have
been important as routes for contacts between Southeast and Central Texas, but
there are few artifact types that could show contacts between Northeast and
Inland Southeast Texas in the same manner that projectile point and flint types
show contacts between Central and Inland Southeast Texas. This is probably
because the technological traditions of Northeast and Inland Southeast Texas
are fairly similar, except for the Caddo Culture.

DISCUSSION
This summary of a data base for Inland Southeast Texas presents a good
general picture of the current status of research in this subregion. For example,
more details are now available on geographic distributions of artifact types to
represent technological traditions. Enough data are now available to support
research on several topics concerning the archeology of this subregion that have
not yet been addressed in detail. As mentioned above, the complete current data
base will be published, and it will be revised as new data become available.
In general, previous conclusions made in summaries of the Southeastern
Texas region (Patterson 1979a, 1983) are supported by the more detailed information now available in this data base. For example, previous conclusions on
population dynamics and the decline of pottery use in the Late Prehistoric still
seem to be valid. Some aspects of the prehistory of this subregion, such as faunal subsistence and general settlement patterns, are now fairly well outlined,
although the nature of seasonal patterns remains poorly understood. More detailed chronologies need to be developed here for artifact types, in order to make
it possible to address several other research problems in more detail.
The amount of data available on the archeology of Inland Southeast Texas
is especially impressive when it is noted that most of these data have been developed in only the last 20 years, and at a minimum expenditure of public funds;
few of the publications for sites in this data base are dated before 1970.
Regardless of any regional research planning that is done, professional work
in this subregion will probably continue under the vagaries of contract work
carried out in connection with construction projects. This means that the types
of sites and geographic areas will not be closely coordinated with any regional
research plan. It is hoped that more contract work will be done in the future on
well-stratified sites. The development of more detailed chronological sequences
and more geographically uniform data should be major goals in future regional
research planning. The role of avocational archeologists will continue to be
important in this region, especially for research involving sites on private land
(Patterson 1988d:380). Well over half of the publications for Inland Southeast
Texas sites have been written by avocational archeologists.
SUMMARY
This paper has presented a quantitative summary of a data base for published archeological sites of Inland Southeast Texas. It is hoped that this summary and the detailed data base, which will be published separately, will be useful
for research in this region and for the orientation of Inland Southeast Texas in
the general prehistory of Texas. Since this data base will be revised as new data
become available, there should be no time limitation on its value. Because of
the large amounts of data available, a tabulated data base has become an essential tool for regional research planning, execution, and synthesis.
