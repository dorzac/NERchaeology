Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a pedestrian survey of the 13.5-mile
Whitetail Dilley Interconnect to be installed by Mockingbird Midstream Gas Services, L.L.C.
(Mockingbird) in southeastern Zavala county. The project was entirely privately funded, and the
properties across which the pipeline will cross are privately owned; therefore, no Texas
Antiquities Permit was required.
The undeveloped right-of-way was subjected to a pedestrian survey by two archaeologists on
June 8 and 22, 2012. Two previously undiscovered archaeological sites (41ZV509 and
41ZV510) were documented along the right-of-way, and previously documented site 41ZV506
was re-visited. In addition four isolated pieces of chipped stone were found. Our assessment of
41ZV506, 41ZV509, and 41ZV510 was that they are all surficial in nature and heavily disturbed.
The four isolated pieces of chipped stone are in and of themselves considered to be nonsignificant.
Accordingly, TAAI recommended that construction of the pipeline be allowed to proceed, with
no further archaeological investigations. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that
if any undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development of the properties,
such finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified
archaeological consultant. No artifacts were collected during this survey.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly four individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Ms. Judy Vader
and Mr. Ryan DeBarros, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, and Mr.
Ronnie Glenewinkel and Mr. David Black, Environmental Coordinator and Permitting Specialist
at Mockingbird Midstream. All were extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and
their overall knowledge of the project contributed significantly to our understanding of the
project’s scope of work.
In addition, I express my sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologist Belisario Silva,
who worked hard, long hours, and expressed an attitude and work ethic that ensured this survey
was conducted in a thorough and professional manner.

Modern Environmental Setting
Climate and Vegetation
Zavala county is located in south-central Texas near its southern border with Mexico (see Figure
1). Its current political boundary encompasses 1,298 square miles. The generally flat to rolling
terrain ranges in elevation from about 580-964 feet above mean sea level. Clayey and loamy soils
support the growth of small predominately mesquite trees, and thorny scrub brush with assorted
cacti and grassy understory, but with all oak, pecan, and elm along the riverine environments such
as the Leona and Frio rivers (Ochoa 1996).
With its semi-arid environment, the county is generally frost-free from late-February through early
December, allowing for a 282-day growing season. The average annual rainfall is about 22 inches,
with most rainfall occurring in May and September. These peaks are the result of thunderstorms
bearing moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the Pacific Ocean much farther to the
west. Zavala county is known as part of the Winter Garden Region for the vegetables grown there
(Ochoa 1996; Stevens and Arriaga 1985).
However, rainfall amounts vary significantly from year to year, and the high evapotranspiration
effects in the area effectively offset any beneficial surplus of annual rainfall. This is another reason
irrigation systems are so necessary, and commonly found in use today throughout the area.
Summers are indeed hot and dry, with temperatures consistently hovering above 1000F, although
humidity is generally low compared to environments closer to the Gulf Coast. Overall, the
county’s climate can be classified as subtropical steppe.
Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande are the major southeasterly trending rivers draining the
South Texas region. A subtle divide through the northeastern portion of the counties causes
numerous intermittent creeks to flow north into the Nueces River, and numerous others of the
same type to drain southward into the Rio Grande. Many drainages intermittently flow into both.
Although there are many springs in south Texas, very few are active due primarily to the dip of
the substrate shales which carry these subterranean seeps to the south and east. As a result, some
of these active seeps/springs can be found on the Mexican side of the national border. Ancient
springs that may have existed in the area at one time have likely succumbed to overgrazing and
irrigation pumping during modern times (Brune 1981). During our investigations of the Project
Area in June 2012, we observed no flowing water or niche pools.
Flora and Fauna
The project area lies within the South Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation area (Figure 6) as
defined by Gould (1975), and the regional flora of South Texas has been classified as being part
of the Tamaulipan biotic province extending out from northeast Mexico (Figure 7). This is the

5

only part of Texas where some
vegetation exhibits growth throughout
the year (Blair 1950). Thorny brush is
the dominant vegetation today, but this
is a relatively recent occurrence, with a
mix of woody and grassland species
providing a savanna environment
during prehistoric times (Archer 1995;
Black 1989; Hester 1980; Inglis 1964).
The original vegetation was an open
grassland mixed with brushy chaparral.
Oaks, pecan, and ash were common
along perennial streams. Due in part to
overgrazing and the exclusion of fire,
the invasion of woody species has
changed the vegetation into “Texas
brush country” dominated by mesquite,
acacia, spiny hackberry, brazil,
whitebrush, lotebrush, and others
(Diamond et al. 1987:203-221). On
sandy soils, the brush includes
mesquite with mixed grasses. In
contrast, clay soils support mesquite Figure 6. Physiographic regions of Texas
(Proposis juliflora), various species of (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg).
Acacia, and mimosa, granjeno or
desert hackberry (Celtis pallida),
lignum vitae (Porliera angustifolia),
cenizo (Leucophyllum texanum), white
brush (Aloysia texana), prickly pear
(Opuntia lindheeimeri), tasajillo
(Opuntia leptocaulis), and species of
Condalia and Castela (Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country
exhibits some of the greatest
mammalian species diversity in the
state. Sixty-one species of mammals,
36 snakes, 19 lizards, and several
species of turtles, salamanders, and
frogs are present in the region (Blair
1950). Approximately 50 species of
fish have been identified in the lower
Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982)
from analysis of phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data
there along with data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or lateglacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew
warmer and drier, and more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years
ago. Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago
was much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the
present time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The Project Area lies within the South Texas Archaeological region as defined by Hester (1980,
1995, 2004; Figure 8). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is problematic, due to the
compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of stratified sites excavated
within the region. The largest and most informational cultural resources survey in South Texas
was that conducted prior to development of the Choke Canyon Reservoir in Atascosa, Live Oak,
and McMullen counties (e.g. Hall et al. 1986). Nevertheless, Hester (1995:433) acknowledges
the paucity of information that exists for south Texas and as such offers only a “general
framework” for prehistoric periods particular to the region (Figure 5). All dates are given as
approximate years before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995; 2004).
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of Clovistype points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,

7

ochre, and shaft straighteners.
During the late Paleoindian
interval, the first stemmed
lanceolate points, such as
Angostura, Golondrina, St.
Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among
a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian
adaptation has been considered
to be one of small bands of
nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late
Pleistocene fauna, including
mammoth, mastodons, bison,
camel, and horse, across North
America (Black 1989). More
recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of
plants and animals used for
subsistence by these early
Americans, such as turtles and
tortoises, alligators, mice,
badgers, and raccoons, although
they undoubtedly hunted the
large animals as well (Collins
1995:381). Known Clovis sites
include killsites, quarries,
caches, open campsites, ritual
sites, and burials (Hester
1995:433–436; 2004). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis.
Folsom artifacts are fairly
common in south Texas;
however, no camp sites or
killsites have been found south
of a large workshop, Pavo Real
(41BX52), in Bexar County
(Hester 1995:434–435; 2004).
Most Paleoindian finds in south
Texas have consisted of surface
lithic scatters on upland terraces
and ridges (Black 1989).
Figure 8. South Texas Archaeological region cultural
chronology.
As the warming that marks the
8

transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take effect in Texas, prehistoric
inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also marked by the decline and
extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison (Bison antiquus). Large
gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters were forced to
concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence
base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the
Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was
necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as deer, fish,
and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock
cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups
were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly
distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including most
of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low during
the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few
constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization of a
wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as
well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population,
based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). On the
South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear
continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. Weir (1976)
believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at
least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of
gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned
rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). The common
presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took
place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward less
mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas
Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750
B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P,
9

Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner et al. (2011) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period during
the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is represented
by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap the Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442;2004). Weir (1976) believes this marked
a transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and bison, and
a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw 1985; Peter
1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not disappear and sites
were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995; 2004]). A series of distinctive traits
mark the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift
to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South
Texas Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
10

flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a nonstandard
manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the ones that best
suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core reduction and
the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology is a continent-wide
phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally sending
a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live near
each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans were
rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
11

1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then, is
generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

Zavala County Prehistory and History
Indian artifacts found in Zavala County indicate that the area has been occupied for about 11,000
years, and one of the earliest known human habitation sites in Zavala County was found on the
Holdsworth Ranch northeast of Crystal City (Holdsworth 1986; Ochoa 1996). As well, many
archaeological sites with Archaic diagnostic artifacts have been collected across a wide and
diversified terrain in the county, to include uplands and stream terraces. Although the present-day,
semi-arid conditions persist across much of Zavala County, plentiful food sources such as wild
game, fruits, seeds, and roots were likely plentiful subsistence resources to prehistoric inhabitants.
The multiple Native American Indian groups who were present in the Zavala County area when
the Spanish entradas penetrated the region in the 1600s and 1700s were generically referred to
as Coahuiltecans. As discussed above, the nomenclature assigned to these groups derived moreso
from a quasi-common language than from any other kinship or close-knit tribal or band identity.
To repeat, this affiliation: Coahuiltecan is a term coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and
the name refers to the many small bands of Native Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila,
Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans were rapidly dispersed or killed during the
Protohistoric period.
Within the modern-day political confines of Zavala County, there are no known written records
that indicate there were any sort of permanent structures or habitation areas were established by
the Spaniards as they began traversing through the Zavala County area in the late 1600s.
Tonkawans, and Lipan and Mescalero Apaches were the more specifically named groups of
Native Americans who were known to have perhaps seasonally or less frequently occupied the
area in the 1700s. The old Spanish Road, or Camino Reale, coursed through modern-day Zavala
County, and one of the earliest Spanish encounters with a large ranchería, or Indian village, was
recorded by Spanish explorers near present-day La Pryor in 1716. The Camino Reale through
Zavala County was once again followed in 1836 as Mexican General Lopez de Santa Anna’s army
crossed the Nueces River near present-day Crystal City enroute to the Alamo in Bexár.
Following the newly established Mexico Republic’s revolution over Spanish rule in 1824, the
Mexican government realized that the vast, untamed, and generally uninhabited area north of the
12

Rio Grande somehow needed to be brought under control by the new Mexican government.
Although a few attempts to settle these lands were made by issuing Mexican land grants, the
attempts were short-lived, and in many cases pre-empted by the independence of Texas from
Mexico following the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836. Most of Zavala County lay in the disputed
area between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River between the Texas Revolution and the
Mexican War (1836–46), and lawless in general prevailed. With a defensive posture ulterior
motive in mind, the Texas legislature established Zavala County in 1846. For a truly enjoyable
account of some of the earliest pioneer settlers in Zavala County, the reader is referred to the
memoirs of Ernest Holdsworth (2006).
Commercial and economic development in Zavala County was then spurred in the late 1800s by
the eventual diffusing of Indian raids, allowing for the expansion of cattle ranching throughout
the south Texas region. In 1884, the first of many artesian wells was drilled, and from that point
on, irrigated garden crops increased in ubiquity throughout south Texas and Zavala County. In
response, rail lines were constructed through Zavala County in the early 1900s in order to
transport the abundant crops of onions, spinach, grains, and fruits (Ochoa 1996). It was during
these flourishing times that Zavala County became known as a part of the “Winter Garden
Region”.

Site Types That Could be Expected Along the Project Area
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Zavala County are prehistoric open campsites
ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure 8). Some of
these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped
for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of
people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these
same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found at these
large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing
multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from
making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from
terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells.
Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine
environment that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands
away from flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different
food source that could be exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads
and tunas, and agave hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze on the
northern South Texas Plains, and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone tools
(Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
13

to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients
that can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that could be expected along
the Whitetail Dilley Interconnect. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and
broken tools that were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their
old ones. The general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found
at open campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period
of time (However, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles
to make them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the
natural outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite
cobbles.
Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two
flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the
quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they
‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior,
then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites
are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried
away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and
the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic
scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles
flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further
reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry
blanks are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to
areas of south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry
blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found
on any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops
that were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried
today, and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics
of landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in Zavala County have been documented
along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries and Procurement Sites
Prehistoric quarries and procurement also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic
periods, but differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose
14

gravels, but at times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or
quartzites were not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’.
These types of sites are rare in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally
do not present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to
pick up gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped
stone remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites,
as well as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be
expected. Although a handful of prehistoric quarries or procurement sites have been recorded in
south Texas, they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
There are no documented burned rock middens in Zavala County. Burned rock middens result
from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much like modern-day roasting
pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the larger rocks that serve
as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective as a thermal source,
they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable, another is dug
near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched out’ firecracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the
formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and
Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in south
Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites in both
upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, but the largest prehistoric cemetery
found in proximity to the Whitetail Dilley Interconnect is 41LK28, in Live Oak County.
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology portion of this report, although Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th century, and Spanish entradas
began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no record of any sort of
permanent structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the area was generally not
considered safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers then
began establishing smaller ranches and farmlands (Leffler 2011).
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
south Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.
In general, the area has apparently been historically used as ranchland pasture, with no
15

development other than associated ranching activities such as windmills, stock tanks, corrals, and
sparsely scattered outbuildings. In sum, there may be rare and isolated occurrences of early
ranching activities along the Traylor pipelines, but the expectations of encountering any
archaeological site of significance from the 1500s through the mid-1900s along those portions
of the pipeline were minimal.

Archaeological Atlas Site and Historic Map Results
Zavala County
As of March 5, 2013 there were 417 archaeological sites recorded within the county. Of those,
324 are prehistoric open campsites with evidence that as a whole, open campsites in the county
have been occupied from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods. Notably, one of these has
a possible human burial on it, and mammoth bones or teeth have been found on three of these
sites. Two of the three sites with mammoth remains also have Plainview projectile points, and the
third has Archaic points. As with most of the region, many campsites are situated on stream
terraces, but there are also some in the uplands. Ninety are classified as lithic scatters, and
generally these are located in the uplands and along stream cutbanks where gravels outcrop. They
also exhibit evidence of being used for the past 11,000 years. One rock shelter has been recorded
in the county, as has a single mussel shell midden. The rock shelter has carved petroglyphs as well
as pictographs painted with deep red iron pigments. Two of the six historic components in the
county are associated with John King Fisher, rancher, lawman, and outlaw of the 1800s. He is
said to have occupied the same rock shelter in which the petrographs and petroglyphs were found,
and his house site is also documented as an archaeological site. Other historic sites include 1800s
and 1900s artifact scatters, and a World War II internment camp in Crystal City (Atlas 2013.
Surveys and Sites within One Mile of the Project Area
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archeological sites indicated that
no professional archaeological surveys had been conducted within one mile (1,609 meters).
However, as shown in Figures 3 and 5, Tierras Antiguas has conducted six surveys within one
mile (Nickels 2011; 2012 a-c; 2013a, b). As shown in Figures 3 aqnd 5, there were three
previously recorded archaeological sites within one mile of the Whitetail Dilley Interconnect,
briefly described as follows:
41ZV53
This is a prehistoric open campsite recorded in 1970 by T. C. Hill. Jr. At the time, he described
it as scattered cultural material covering roughly 600-800 yards in length along a ridge, and
consisting of fire-cracked rocks from hearths, and stone tools. Part of the site had been root
plowed, and part of the site was overgrown with buffalo grass. Stone tools collected by Hill are
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin (Atlas 2013).
41ZV459
This site was recorded in June 2010 by Briscoe/Szarka Consulting Services (Atlas 2013). At that
time it was described as a large lithic workshop with a large outcropping of Edwards chert on an
eroded upland area with mesquite and cactus. However, when TAAI archaeologists conducted
16

surveys of the Traylor West Lateral, the Traylor North A 2H Pipeline, and the LLM Lateral in
2011 and 2012, we noted that the site description provided does not at all match the terrain in
that area, and we observed no artifacts.
41ZV506
41ZV506 is a prehistoric open campsite of an unknown age, consisting of scattered fire-cracked
rocks, lithic debitage and an occasional biface fragment. It is situated on a gently sloping upland
area between Loma Vista Creek to the east, and one of its first order tributaries to the west. It
was documented by TAAI archaeologists in June 2012. However, the site was heavily disturbed
and thus possessed little if any, research potential (Nickels 2013b).
Historic Maps
Because of the relatively low habitation in generally rural areas that the Whitetail Dilley
Interconnect passes through, little or no attention was given to early aerial photography. In lieu
of this, the oldest topographic maps found of the area were 1939 and 1940 US Army Corps of
Engineers map of the Big Wells and Batesville areas (Maps 2012a, b). Although no historic
structures are apparent along the proposed Whitetail Dilley Interconnect right-of-way, these maps
are not exact by today’s standards, and it is possible that historic water tanks, corrals,
outbuildings other structures related to early ranching activities could be encountered along the
Project Area that do not appear on any old maps. Technically, any structures older than 45 years
are now considered of interest by the Texas Historical Commission, and this would be considered
during the survey.

Soils
Figures 9-12 depict the soils that will to be dissected by the Whitetail Dilley Interconnect (Stevens
and Arriaga 1985; Web Soil Survey 2012). It will cross through 11 different soil types that offer
varying depths, sedimentation and deposition rates. As such, they likewise imply the potential for
the preservation of intact cultural resources to exist. Table 1 lists the soils that are to be dissected
by the Whitetail Dilley Interconnect (Stevens and Arriaga 1985; Web Soil Survey 2011). The
terrain and soils existing in these upland areas along the Whitetail Dilley Interconnect suggest for
the most part, a minimal to moderate probability for buried and intact archaeological deposits to
exist. It is unlikely that significant sites are extant in these upland areas. However, the soils along
creeks suggested a moderate to high potential for buried and intact archaeological deposits to be
extant.

Field Survey Goals and Methodology
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)
locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;
22

2)
3)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,
place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Two archaeologists conducted an intensive 100-percent pedestrian survey along the pipeline,
meandering back and forth across the 100-foot width of the right-of-way (ROW). Surface
visibility ranged from 50 to 100 percent. All cutbanks, and rodent and mammal backdirt piles
along the right-of-way were thoroughly examined. In accordance with a general “no collection”
policy, cultural material of a redundant nature, both prehistoric and historic, were not to be
collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via sketches, field photographs, and copious
notes.
Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be
considered as significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early ArchaicPaleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case
basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist.
Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences adjacent to the ROW were to be
documented with photographs and included in this report of investigations.
Archaeological sites discovered were mapped using a pace-and-compass method, as well as a
GPS. Field notes were made about the site and a sketch map was drawn. Digital photographs of
the site and selected artifacts were taken, as well as selected photographs representing the
surveyed right-of-way in general; an accompanying photo log was maintained (available upon
request from TAAI in Martindale, Texas). Isolated Finds were either sketched or photographed,
and descriptive notes were made. Their positions were recorded using a handheld GPS, and they
were placed back on the surface where they were found.

Results of the Investigations

During the survey it became readily apparent that approximately 90 percent of the project’s
surface area was either mechanically disturbed, or deflated by artificial processes. However, the
surface visibility was excellent, allowing for the discovery of any artifacts along the right-of-way.
Two previously undiscovered archaeological sites (41ZV509 and 41ZV510) were documented,
and previously recorded site 41ZV506 was revisited. In addition, three Isolated Finds were
recorded. The sites and Isolated Finds are described below.

23

41ZV506
This site was documented by TAAI archaeologists in June 2012 during a survey of the re-aligned
Richter Lateral, just a few days before the Whitetail Dilley Interconnect survey was conducted,
and we have no further information to add regarding the condition of the site from what was
published in the Richter Lateral Re-alignment report (Nickels 2013b). We described it a large
open campsite ideally situated between Loma Vista Creek and one of its first order tributaries,
so that it afforded easy access to fresh water and the associated riverine subsistence items. At the
same time, upland resources such as mammals, plants, and abundant chert gravels were in close
proximity. Based upon its apparent large size, it could be presumed that various areas of the site
were occupied periodically through the past several millenia. However, without a full scale survey
and the discovery of diagnostics and/or features in discrete areas, this will remain an unknown.
The portion of the site that will be impacted by construction of the Richter Lateral is generally
mechanically disturbed, and otherwise has shallow and eroded soils. In view of this, Tierras
Antiguas recommended that construction of the Richter Lateral as currently planned be allowed
to proceed through the site, with no further investigations.

41ZV509
Description
41ZV509 (Figures 13 and 14) is an
historic site with scattered construction
materials and household artifacts. It is
situated on a gentle southwesterly
sideslope facing the east bank of
Burtrand Creek. Although moderately
dense mesquite trees and prickly pear
cactus are now prevalent across the
site, there is one large mesquite in the
center of the site that may have
provided shade for the structure and
yard. Closer to Burtrand Creek, the
vegetation is thick and dense, with low
thorny brush and dense herbaceous
weeds and grasses (see Figures 13 and
14). Surface visibility in June 2012
averaged roughly 70 percent across the
site. Surface elevation at the site ranges
from 650-655 feet above mean sea level
(amsl). Soils on the site are mapped as
Duval fine sandy loam, gently
undulating (DVB).

and batten shack that
may have served as a temporary habitation for a ranch hand some time during the 1930s through
perhaps the 1960s. As discussed above, this structure did not appear on any topograhic maps
available for that era. The shack was ideally located next to Burtrand Creek, which most likely
provided freash water before the 1950s drought and pumping for crop irrigation dried up many
of the springs and creeks in this area of south Texas.
In its current collapsed and scattered condition, other than its positioning on the landscape
25

representing ranching activities in southeastern Zavala County during the 1930s through the
1960s, our assessment is that the research value of 41ZV509 is considered minimal. Accordingly,
Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Whitetail Dilley Interconnect be allowed
to proceed through the site as planned, with no further archaeological investigations.

41ZV510

Description
41ZV510 (Figures 16
and 17) is a prehistoric
open campsite of an
unknown
age,
consisting of scattered
fire-cracked rocks,
lithic debitage and a
stone tool fragment. It
is situated in an upland
area on a gentle
southwestern slope
roughly 200 m east of
Bertrand Creek. The
area appears to have
been machine cleared in
recent historic times,
and machine created
terraces for farming are
spread across the
landscape. The
immediate site area has

thorny brush, and
assorted cacti. Surface visibility averaged approximately 80 percent across the site. Surface
elevation at the site ranges from 667-669 feet above mean sea level (amsl), and soils on the site
are mapped as Duval fine sandy loam, gently undulating(DYB).

26

Levels of Effort and
Results
An inspection of the
surface suggests that
the site covers
approximately 5,200
square meters. Artifacts
discovered on the
surface included widely
dispersed fire-cracked
rocks, core reduction
flakes, middle stage
bifacial manufacturing
flakes, and a biface
fragment (see for
example, Figure 18). As
discussed above, the
significant disturbance

that has occurred did
not warrant any
investigations beyond a
surface survey.
Site Summary,
Conclusions, and
Recommendations
This relatively small
prehistoric open
campsite is situated in
an area where abundant
chert gravels exposed
across the surface were
exploited for the
manufacture of bifacial
stone tools. Although
roughly 200 meters
remote from what is
today an intermittently Figure 18. Selected artifacts found on the surface at 41ZV510: left

the drainage may have
been spring fed and flowing regularly at various times in prehistory. The site’s location would
have offered easy access to not only the chert gravels for fashioning stone tools, but also access
to upland game animals and plants. Although the site’s size and limited variety of stone tools
suggests a short-term and possibly seasonal occupation, without the discovery of diagnostics the
time period (or periods) of occupation(s) will remain an unknown.
27

In sum, other than it positioning on the landscape as a relatively small prehistoric open campsite,
in its current heavily disturbed condition we assess the site as possessing minimal, if any research
value. In view of this, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Whitetail Dilley
Interconnect be allowed to proceed through the site as planned, with no further investigations.

Isolated Find 1
Isolated Find 1 is a middle stage bifacial
manufacturing flake made from fine
grained, non-heated tan chert (Figure
19). It was found on a heavily eroded
and bladed surface at N3181367
E445024 (NAD83).

Figure 19. Isolated Find 1.

Isolated Find 2
Isolated Find 2 consists of a crude
scraper and core reduction flake found
on bladed surfaces several meters
remote from each other, but in the
proximity of N3187567 E448506
(NAD83). Both are made from finegrained, non-heated chert (Figure 20).

Isolated Find 3
Isolated Find 3 is a biface fragment
found on a claypan two-track road
surface at N3187846 E448504
(NAD83). It is made from tan fine
grained, non-heated chert (Figure 21). It
exhibits no cortex on either its dorsal or
ventral surface and has been reduced to
a mddle stage of manufacture.

Figure 21. Biface (Isolated Find 3).

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
The proposed Whitetail Dilley Interconnect right-of-way was subjected to a pedestrian survey by
two archaeologists on June 8 and 22, 2012. Two previously undiscovered archaeological sites
(41ZV509 and 41ZV510) were documented along the right-of-way, and previously documented
site 41ZV506 was re-visited. In addition four isolated pieces of chipped stone were found. Our
assessment of 41ZV506, 41ZV509, and 41ZV510 is that they are all surficial in nature and
heavily disturbed. The four isolated pieces of chipped stone are in and of themselves considered
to be non-significant.
Accordingly, TAAI recommends that construction of the pipeline be allowed to proceed, with no
further archaeological investigations. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any
undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development of the properties, such
finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant.
