MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the month of January 2008, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the Orange County Water Control and
Improvement District No. 1’s (OCWCID) proposed improvements to its Oak Lane Waste Water
Treatment Plant (WWTP) located near Vidor in Orange County, Texas.
Proposed
improvements include activities within the existing 15-acre WWTP as well as the installation of
approximately 1.9 miles of waste water line extending away from the WWTP. As OCWCID is
considered to be a subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The undertaking will also be funded in part by the Clean
Water State Revolving Fund, which is federal money administered by the Texas Water
Development Board (TWDB). As such the undertaking is also regulated by Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Carroll & Blackman, Inc.
(CBI), on behalf of OCWCID, contracted with Horizon to conduct the survey in compliance with
the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. Horizon conducted the survey under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) Permit No. 4748. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural
resources were located within the APE, and, if so, to determine their eligibility listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for formal designation as State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs).
Currently, approximately 9 of the 15 acres within the existing WWTP have been utilized
as part of the existing facility. Construction activities are anticipated to take place only within the
previously cleared areas, although an alteration in plans may require impacts to portions of the
6 acres of the property that are currently forested. Regarding the 1.9 miles of proposed waste
water line, approximately 90% of the line will be installed within existing, previously disturbed
pipeline and road rights-of-way (ROWs). The remaining 10% (approximately 1000 feet) will
traverse previously un-impacted areas. In all, the WWTP and the proposed ROWs total
approximately 18.5 acres. The undisturbed areas assessed during the survey efforts (i.e., 6
acres of undisturbed areas within the WWTP and the 1000 feet of new ROW not contained
within existing pipeline and road ROWs) totaled approximately 6.3 acres
The survey of the 6.3 acres of undisturbed areas associated with the Oak Lane WWTP
improvements project resulted in entirely negative findings. No evidence of cultural materials
was observed on the inspected ground surface or within any of the 23 excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion that the

HJN 080006 AR

Management Summary

proposed Oak Lane WWTP project will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that
no further investigations are warranted. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the undertaking.
Subsequent to the completion of the survey and reporting of the initial Oak Lane WWTP
improvements, Horizon was informed of 2 additional components of the overall project. These
additional components consist of: 1) the abandonment of the Tiger Lake WWTP and the
rerouting of waste water pumped to this WWTP to the Oak Lane WWTP; and 2) the
abandonment of the Clover Leaf WWTP and the rerouting of waste water pumped to this
WWTP also to the Oak Lane WWTP. To facilitate the assessment of the new components,
Horizon requested an amendment to TAC permit no. 4748 that included the ROWs of the 2 new
force mains from the Tiger Lake and Clover Leaf WWTPs to the Oak Lane WWTP.
The assessment of the proposed Tiger Lake and Clover Leaf force main ROWs found
that all proposed construction activities associated with these aspects of the project will take
place within areas that have been previously disturbed by road construction, drainage ditch
excavation, and utility installation. No locations along either force main ROW were observed as
having any potential for containing intact, buried cultural deposits. As a result, no impacts to
significant cultural deposits are anticipated.
Based on the observed lack of any areas having the potential to contain intact cultural
deposits along the proposed Tiger Lake and Clover Leaf force main ROWs, as well as the prior
negative surveys conducted along portions of the force main ROWs, it is Horizon’s opinion that
these proposed improvements associated with the overall Oak Lane WWTP improvement
project will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are
warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the entire
undertaking. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human
remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during the construction
activities, all work at that location should cease immediately and the THC should be notified of
the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Orange County Water Control and Improvement District No. 1 (OCWCID) is proposing
improvements to its Oak Lane Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) located near Vidor in
Orange County, Texas. Proposed improvements include activities within the existing 15-acre
WWTP as well as the installation of approximately 1.9 miles of waste water line extending away
from the WWTP (Figures 1 and 2). As OCWCID is considered to be a subdivision of the state,
the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). The
undertaking will also be funded in part by the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, which is
federal money administered by the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). As such the
undertaking is also regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of
1966, as amended. Carroll & Blackman, Inc. (CBI), on behalf of OCWCID, has contracted with
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct the survey in compliance with the
ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. Horizon conducted the survey under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) Permit No. 4748. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any cultural
resources were located within the APE, and, if so, to determine their eligibility listing on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for formal designation as State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs).
Currently, approximately 9 of the 15 acres within the existing WWTP have been utilized
as part of the existing facility. Construction activities are anticipated to take place only within the
previously cleared areas, although an alteration in plans may require impacts to portions of the
6 acres of the property that are currently forested. Regarding the 1.9 miles of proposed waste
water line, approximately 90% of the line will be installed within existing, previously disturbed
pipeline and road rights-of-way (ROWs). The remaining 10% (approximately 1000 feet) will
traverse previously un-impacted areas. In all, the WWTP and the proposed ROWs total
approximately 18.5 acres. The undisturbed areas assessed during the survey efforts (i.e., 6
acres of undisturbed areas within the WWTP and the 1000 feet of new ROW not contained
within existing pipeline and road ROWs) totaled approximately 6.3 acres.
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the undisturbed areas, and the production of a report suitable for review by
the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the Principal Investigator for the
project. Jared Wiersema (Horizon field technician) conducted the field investigation on 23
January 2008.
The survey of the WWTP and waste water line ROW entailed both surface inspection
and subsurface shovel testing. For acreage projects (i.e., the WWTP area), the Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2
acres on projects this size. As such, a total of 7 shovel tests were necessary within the WWTP
area. Horizon excavated a total of 5 shovel tests within the confines of the WWTP. The
TSMASS were not met due to the fact that much of the facility has been impacted by the original
construction of the facility and the fact that a high percentage of the western portion of the
property was covered with standing water from recent rains. The presence of this standing
water would suggest that such an area would not have been highly desirable for aboriginal
occupation.
Because approximately 90% of the proposed waste water line will be installed within
existing, previously disturbed pipeline and road ROWs, the field assessment focused on the
10% (approximately 1000 feet) of proposed waste water line that crosses an undisturbed knoll,
the only location along the ROW where the potential for intact cultural deposits was possible.
The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring 100
feet in width. As the proposed ROW width along the 1000 feet of undisturbed area will measure
only 15 feet in width, only 1 shovel test was necessary to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon
exceeded the TSMASS at this location by excavating 3 shovel tests along this length of ROW.
In addition, Horizon also conducted 15 additional shovel tests at other locations along the
proposed waste water line route to confirm the absence of cultural materials, even in previously
disturbed ROWs. In all, a total of 23 shovel tests were excavated within the WWTP and along
the proposed waste water line alignment.
The survey of the 6.3 acres of undisturbed areas associated with the Oak Lane WWTP
improvements project resulted in entirely negative findings. No evidence of cultural materials
was observed on the inspected ground surface or within any of the 23 excavated shovel tests.
Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
proposed Oak Lane WWTP project will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that
no further investigations are warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance
be granted for the undertaking. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during the
construction activities, all work at that location should cease immediately and the THC should
be notified of the discovery.

2.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Oak Lane WWTP improvements are located west of Vidor in Orange County,
Texas. They can be found on the US Geologic Service (USGS) 7.5’ Pine Forest, Texas,
topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1). The Oak Lane WWTP consists of an existing facility
totaling 15 acres. Of these 15 acres, approximately 9 acres within the eastern portion of the
property have been utilized to house the various facilities necessary for the operation of the
WWTP. The 6 acres on the western portion of the property are forested areas that have not
been impacted by the WWTP facilities. At this time, all proposed improvements to the Oak
Lane WWTP are slated to occur within the 9 acres of previously disturbed areas. However, the
potential exists for impacts slightly west within the 6-acre previously undisturbed portion of the
property. As such, OCWCID requested an assessment of these 6 acres in the event that
impacts to this area were necessary. Representative photographs of the WWTP are presented
in Figures 3 through 5.
The proposed 1.9 miles of waste water line ROW will initiate at the eastern end of the
WWTP property and extend to the northeast within an existing pipeline ROW and within various
road ROWs (see Figure 1). As these are existing ROWs that have been impacted by pipeline
and utility installation, the potential for intact cultural deposits within them was deemed minimal.
However, approximately 1000 feet of the proposed waste water line will cross a small knoll
located between the existing pipeline ROW and existing road ROWs. This area has not been
impacted and had the greatest potential to contain intact cultural deposits, if present. As such,
the field investigations focused shovel testing efforts over this 1000-foot-long section of ROW.
Representative photographs along the proposed waste water line ROW are presented in
Figures 6 through 10.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Oak Lane WWTP is situated on 1 of the first elevated areas east of the floodplain of
the Neches River. The location is generally level with no visible topography, although the areas
just south of the WWTP are at higher elevations, and, as such, exhibit a higher degree of
development. Areas immediately surrounding the WWTP to the north, south, and west consist
of active sand quarries. Areas east of the WWTP consist of bands of elevated sandy ridges

interspersed with marshy areas that may represent remnant channel scars of the Neches River,
which is located approximately 2.5 miles west of the WWTP. The proposed waste water line is
located within an existing pipeline ROW that crosses several of these alternating ridge/marsh
bands. The aforementioned elevated knoll where 1000 feet of the proposed waste water line
will be installed in undisturbed areas is one of the first elevated locations east of the ridge/marsh
bands where the topography changes to more of an upland setting.

2.3

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologic development of the Texas Coastal Plain began approximately 220 million years
ago during the early Mesozoic Era with the separation of the North American and European
continental plates. This Gulfian cycle consisted of several periods of continental extension
(rifting) and compression. During the Triassic, discontinuous rift basins were formed that were
generally oriented parallel to the edge of the developing ocean basin and extending from
Mexico to Nova Scotia. Later, as continental separation continued, the rift basins in Texas were
eventually filled by deposits of marine salt. Subsequent burial by river sediment carried in from
the newly emerging Rocky Mountains caused instability and deformation in the buried salt
layers. This led to an upward migration of the salt deposits to a lower confining pressure,
forming a variety of structures collectively known as salt domes. These structures, which are
prominent subsurface features of the Texas Gulf Coast region, formed significant oil and natural
gas traps in the sedimentary rocks that immediately surround them. Additionally, rapid
deposition of deltaic sands over marine mud resulted in an unstable sediment column, leading
to displacement of the sediments by growth faults (large, curved faults that formed during
sediment accumulation and continue to grow with increasing depth of burial). Linear zones of
growth faults of various ages extend from northeastern Mexico into Louisiana and compose
traps for large oil and gas fields (Handbook, 2005).
A review of existing literature indicates that the proposed project is located in an area of
outcropping sediments belonging to the Deweyville Formation (UT-BEG, 1992). In the region,
the Deweyville Formation consists of varying proportions of sand, slit, clay, and some gravel
originating from point-bar, natural levee, stream channel, and backswamp deposits situated only
slightly above the floodplain. The surface topography of the region tends to be characterized by
relict meander patterns of larger radius than current streams and diffusely scattered pimple
mounds. The majority of the subject site is located within an area of the Dewyville Formation
that predominantly consists of silts and clays with deposit thicknesses of up to 50 feet in some
areas (UT-BEG, 1992).
The proposed Oak Lane Waste Water Treatment Plant is located upon BienvillCamptown complex (60%) and Camptown Silty Loam (40%) (see Figure 7) (NRCS, 2008).
These soils occur upon terraces on river valleys or within depressions along the coastal plains.
Bienville soils are derived from sandy alluvium while Camptown soils derive from fluviomarine
deposits. Both parent materials are Late Pleistocene in age (NRCS, 2008).
The proposed waste water line is located entirely upon Bevil Clay (NRCS, 2008). These
soils occur upon flats or within depressions along the coastal plains. Bevil soils are derived
from clayey fluviomarine deposits of Late Pleistocene age (NRCS, 2008).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a 21county area extending from the Colorado River on the west to the Sabine River on the east and
measuring about 200 kilometers (km) (124 miles) inland from the Texas gulf coastline. In broad
terms, much of the archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between
the Southern Great Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995;
Story 1990). Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin subregions of Southeast Texas. These 2 sub-regions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the
inland sub-region has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast
Texas comprises a zone about 25 kilometers (km) (16 miles) inland from the coast that covers
the area influenced by gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable
ecological variability characterizes this sub-region, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes,
wetlands, marine coastline, and barrier islands. The inland sub-region also encompasses
considerable ecological diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney
woods.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to
denote Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural
characteristics of Southeast Texas cultural periods are often different than in neighboring
regions. For instance, the Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and
Southeast Texas, and Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for
Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time
in Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit
evidence of reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be
associated with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of
subsistence-related activities. Inland sites tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired
clay balls (at some sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites
tend to consist of multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain oyster shell tools, large
quantities of pottery (in later cultural components), numerous bone tools, and few lithic
materials.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 5000 BC)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 BC (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (but see Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is
represented by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5000 BC) (Patterson 1995). This stage
coincided with ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that
witnessed the extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing
various periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often
fluted, lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end
scrapers, gravers, and bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas
are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is
little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced during all prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8000 BC), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian
period (8000 to 5000 BC), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).
3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5000 BC TO AD 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5000 BC to AD 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas.
Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and
corresponding decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a
diversified resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas,
however, this hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The
appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone
assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural

12

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the OCWCID Oak Lane WWTP Improvements

stage. Material culture shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in
the application of ground stone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5000 to 3000 BC) is marked by the presence of
Bell, Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The
Bell point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains.
Many of the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3000 to 1500 BC) and
several new types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and
probably the Gary-Kent series. The Late Archaic period (1500 BC to AD 100) is characterized
by Gary, Kent, Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition
developed in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981;
Patterson 1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period
but reached full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as
boatstones and bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang
knives, stingray spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial
practices included the systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre,
and use of locally made grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most
burials are found in extended supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials
are also known. Burial direction is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to
site. Patterson et al. (1993) report that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary
tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton counties.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (AD 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 BC, in the Galveston Bay area by
about AD 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about AD 300, and in the ConroeLivingston inland area by about AD 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears to have
progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995).
Southeastern Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where
Aten (1983) established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common, while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area
129 km (80 miles) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal exception of
a few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found on the Gulf
coast west of the Sabine Lake area.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and the early part of the Historic periods
(Aten 1984; Patterson 1995; Pertulla et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility
ware throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown
Plain for about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods
before once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety,
Goose Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor
pottery types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain variety Conway
(Aten 1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte
types are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste
(like Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (AD 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (AD 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the
latter part of the Late Prehistoric period, but, as already discussed, ceramics appear earlier in
Southeast Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland sub-region along with the bow and arrow through the
Late Prehistoric period (Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995;
Wheat 1953). In fact, Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in
Southeast Texas as early as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points
that consisted of marginally retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a
generalized date of adoption of the bow-and-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca.
AD 600) in Central and Southeast Texas. In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to
be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba,
Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn. A serial sequence for these point types has not been
established in Southeast Texas, though Scallorn points appear to predate Perdiz points
throughout the rest of Texas.
Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto
Plain and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek
pottery remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt
Coated pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in
Southeast Texas during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (AD 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue.
Aten (1983) has
reconstructed the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century,
including the Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco/Karankawa, and Tonkawa. The presence of the
Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central Texas in the
17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought to have
occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the
corresponding mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east
of the San Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe
may be in doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic periods
(Patterson et al. 1993; Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in
identifying Historic Indian sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and
possibly Fresno and Cuney points after AD 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites
are usually identified by the presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types
of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (POST AD 1700 )

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez
Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near
Galveston Bay; however, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until
after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission
system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native
culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where
the burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the
time heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous
Indian population was greatly diminished. The Alabama/Coushatta Indians who currently reside
in Southeast Texas are migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early
19th centuries (Newcomb 1961).
The Atakapas lived on the Lower Neches and Sabine rivers. In 1746, they occupied
2 villages on opposite sides of the Neches near the site of present-day Beaumont. Orcoquiza
Indians occupied the area from the Neches River to halfway between the Trinity and the Brazos.
Six burial mounds have been discovered at Joseph Grigsby’s plantation at Port Neches on the
west bank of the Neches 12 miles below Beaumont, and pottery sherds have been found at
Sabine Lake and in many places throughout the area. The disappearance of the Indians has

HJN 080006 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

been attributed to migration and/or smallpox epidemics; most were gone by the 1820s, when
the first EuroAmerican settlers arrived.
The French and Spanish disputed ownership of the area during the 18th century.
Spanish claims were based on the 1528 expedition of Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, and
French involvement began with La Salle in 1685. By 1730, French fur traders had crossed the
lower Sabine to trade with the Orcoquizas on the Trinity River; however, the area was rarely
visited by EuroAmerican traders because it was bounded on the east by unfordable rivers and
bayous and on the north by the Big Thicket. To prevent French penetration, the Spanish
established San Agustín de Ahumada Presidio and Nuestra Señora de la Luz Mission near the
mouth of the Trinity in 1756. In 1777, Antonio Gil Ibarbo conducted an expedition to investigate
the English presence in Spanish territory, and, in 1785, José de Evia camped at Sabine Pass
and mapped Sabine Lake and the Sabine and Neches rivers. By 1803, when the US acquired
Louisiana, the area of Orange County was under Spanish control as part of the Atascosito
District. In conjunction with filibustering efforts to discourage Spanish shipping after 1816, the
area provided a path for slave smuggling between Louisiana, Point Bolivar, and the Sabine
River until the 1830s. Pirate Jean Laffite maintained a slave barracks on the Sabine River
10 miles north of the site of present Orange to house black slaves in transit. In 1821,
filibustering efforts ceased when the Treaty of Córdova ended Spanish ownership in the region
and made it part of Mexico. Anglo-American colonization subsequently met both hostility and
encouragement from the Mexican government, as settlement efforts brought new families to the
area from 1821 to 1836.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas web site indicated the presence of no previously recorded archeological sites within a 2.0km (1.2-mile) radius of the proposed improvements (THC 2008). No sites, including any listed
in the NRHP or designated as SALs, occur within or immediately adjacent to the proposed
improvements. According to the Atlas, the eastern half of the WWTP (i.e., the portion with
existing impacts) was formally surveyed for cultural resources in 1979. This survey produced
negative results.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the OCWCID Oak Lane WWTP Improvements

5.0 METHODOLOGY

WWTP
A Horizon archeologist surveyed the 6 undisturbed acres within the existing 15-acre
WWTP for cultural resources on 23 January 2008. The other 9 acres comprising the eastern
half of the WWTP were not assessed due to the fact that they had already been assessed in
1979 with negative results. The survey included intensive surface inspection as well as
subsurface shovel tests. For acreage projects (i.e., the WWTP area), the Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 2 acres on
projects this size. As such, a total of 7 shovel tests were necessary within the WWTP area.
Horizon excavated a total of 5 shovel tests within the confines of the WWTP. The TSMASS
were not met due to the fact that much of the facility has been impacted by the original
construction of the facility and the fact that a high percentage of the western portion of the
property was covered with standing water from recent rains. The presence of this standing
water would suggest that such an area would not have been highly desirable for aboriginal
occupation.
Waste Water Line
Because approximately 90% of the proposed waste water line will be installed within
existing, previously disturbed pipeline and road ROWs, the field assessment focused on the
10% (approximately 1000 feet) of proposed waste water line that crosses an undisturbed knoll,
the only location along the ROW where the potential for intact cultural deposits was possible.
The TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring 100
feet in width. As the proposed ROW width along the 1000 feet of undisturbed area will measure
only 15 feet in width, only 1 shovel test was necessary to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon
exceeded the TSMASS at this location by excavating 3 shovel tests along this length of ROW.
In addition, Horizon also conducted 15 additional shovel tests at other locations along the
proposed waste water line route to confirm the absence of cultural materials, even in previously
disturbed ROWs. In all, a total of 23 shovel tests were excavated within the WWTP and along
the proposed waste water line alignment.
For all investigations, only diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points, aboriginal
ceramics, historic ceramics with maker’s marks, etc.) were to be collected and eventually
curated at an approved facility, if recovered. Non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, fire-

cracked rock, scrap metal, glass, etc.) were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and
placed back where they were found. Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils,
land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed, etc. Digital photographs with a photo log
were completed when appropriate. A handheld GPS unit, utilizing the UTM coordinate system
and the NAD 27 map datum, was used to mark the location of all shovel tests as well as any
newly recorded sites, if applicable. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 11. Shovel
test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The survey of the 6.3 acres of undisturbed areas associated with the Oak Lane WWTP
improvements project resulted in entirely negative findings. No evidence of cultural materials
was observed on the inspected ground surface or within any of the 23 excavated shovel tests.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the proposed Oak Lane WWTP project will have no impact on significant cultural resources
and that no further investigations are warranted. Horizon recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the undertaking. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
during the construction activities, all work at that location should cease immediately and the
THC should be notified of the discovery.

Tiger Lake and Clover Leaf Force Mains
and
Oak Lane Collection System Rehabilitation

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the OCWCID Oak Lane WWTP Improvements

Introduction
Subsequent to the completion of the survey and reporting of the initial Oak Lane WWTP
improvements documented in the main body of this document, Horizon was informed of 3
additional components of the overall project. These additional components consist of: 1) the
abandonment of the Tiger Lake WWTP and the rerouting of waste water pumped to this WWTP
to the Oak Lane WWTP; 2) the abandonment of the Clover Leaf WWTP and the rerouting of
waste water pumped to this WWTP also to the Oak Lane WWTP; and 3) the rehabilitation of the
Oak Lane collection system tied to the Wexford Park and Green Forest Subdivisions. The first 2
components (Tiger Lake and Clover Leaf) will require ground disturbances within existing
ROWs. To facilitate the assessment of these 2 new components, Horizon requested an
amendment to TAC permit no. 4748 that included the ROWs of the 2 new force mains from the
Tiger Lake and Clover Leaf WWTPs to the Oak Lane WWTP. The third component (Oak Lane
collection system rehabilitation) will utilize pipebursting, which replaces waste water lines via
trenchless technology. As such, only archival research was conducted for the areas associated
with this portion of the project to determine if a formal field assessment was warranted.
New Force Main Descriptions
The Tiger Lake WWTP and the Clover Leaf WWTP are both existing facilities located to
the north and south of the existing Oak Lane WWTP, respectively (Figure A). The Tiger Lake
WWTP utilizes an existing force main that exits the southeast corner of the facility and travels in
a southeasterly direction, skirting the north end of Smith Lake and then extending south along
the western ROW of State Highway (SH) 105. To facilitate the rerouting of waste water from the
Tiger Lake WWTP (once it is abandoned) to the Oak Lane WWTP, the existing Tiger Lake force
main on the west side of SH 105 will be connected, via a horizontal direction drill (HDD) beneath
SH 105, with the Oak Lane force main that extends along the eastern side of the SH 105 ROW
(reported in the main text of this document). This interconnection of the 2 force mains via HDD
will occur entirely within previously disturbed road and utility ROWs along each side of SH 105.
A general photograph of the location where the Tiger Lake force main will be connected with the
Oak Lane force main is presented in Figure B.
In order to facilitate the rerouting of waste water coming into the Clover Leaf WWTP
once it is abandoned, roughly 2.7 miles (4.3 km) of new force main will be installed between the
Clover Leaf WWTP and the Oak Lane WWTP (see Figure A). The full length of this new force
main between the 2 WWTPs is proposed to be installed entirely within existing road and utility
ROWs. As currently planned, no segments of this force main cross any areas lacking prior
impacts. General photographs of the proposed Clover Leaf force main ROW are presented in
Figures C though F.
Collection System Rehabilitation
In addition to the force mains noted above, the final portion of the overall Oak Lane
WWTP project consists of the rehabilitation of 17.5 miles (28.0 km) of existing wastewater line
between the Oak Lane WWTP and the Wexford Park and Green Forest Subdivisions (Figure B).
Rather than excavating all these existing lines, the rehabilitation will be conducted via
pipebursting, which replaces the waste water lines via trenchless technology. Essentially, new
lines will be inserted into the existing waste water lines without the need for excavation.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas web site indicated the presence of no previously recorded archeological sites within a 2.0km (1.2-mile) perimeter of the proposed Tiger Lake and Clover Leaf force mains or the areas
containing the Oak Lane collection system rehabilitation (THC 2008). The review did indicate
that the Mansfield Cemetery is located roughly 500 m (1640 feet) northeast of the Clover Leaf
WWTP. However, the proposed improvements are all located well away from this cemetery.
The review also indicated the presence of 4 Neighborhood Survey properties within the review
radius for the Oak Lane collection system. The closest Neighborhood Survey property is
located at least 400 m (1312 feet) away from this portion of the project and will not be impacted
by the project.
According to the Atlas, the ROW along SH 105, where the Tiger Lake force main will be
connected to the Oak Lane force main, was surveyed for cultural resources in 1975 with
negative results. The Atlas also showed that a segment of the ROW where the Clover Leaf
force main will be installed was surveyed by Horizon in 2002 with negative results. It also
indicated that the area containing the existing Clover Leaf WWTP has also been surveyed in
1984 with negative results.

Methodology
As the proposed force mains necessary for the rerouting of the waste water from the
Tiger Lake and Clover Leaf WWTPs to the Oak Lane WWTP will be installed completely within
existing, previously disturbed road and utility ROWs, Horizon’s field assessment initiated with
only a visual inspection of the proposed routes, including photo-documentation, to confirm that
all proposed construction activities would occur within previously impacted areas with no
potential to contain buried and intact cultural deposits. If any areas were observed where prior
impacts had not occurred and the potential existed for buried cultural deposits, the Horizon field
technician was to conduct shovel testing efforts at these locations to determine if cultural
deposits were present. However, no such areas were observed along the proposed routes of
the 2 force mains, negating the need for subsurface shovel testing.
The Oak Lane collection system rehabilitation will utilize pipebursting, which replaces
waste water lines via trenchless technology. As such, only archival research was conducted for
the areas associated with this portion of the project to determine if a formal field assessment
was warranted.
Results
The assessment of the proposed Tiger Lake and Clover Leaf force main ROWs found
that all proposed construction activities associated with these aspects of the project will indeed
take place within areas that have been previously disturbed by road construction, drainage ditch
excavation, and utility installation. No locations along either force main ROW were observed as
having any potential for containing intact, buried cultural deposits. As a result, no impacts to
significant cultural deposits are anticipated.
The archival assessment of the Oak Lane collection system rehabilitation areas revealed
no previously recorded archeological sites within or immediately adjacent to these existing
waste water line ROWs. As these are existing waterlines, the potential for any intact cultural
resources within the ROWs is considered to be extremely low. Moreover, as the waste water
lines will be replaced without ground disturbances (i.e., via pipebursting), there are no
anticipated impacts to cultural resources associated with this portion of the project.
Recommendations
Based on the observed lack of any areas having the potential to contain intact cultural
deposits along the proposed Tiger Lake and Clover Leaf force main ROWs, as well as the prior
negative surveys conducted along portions of the force main ROWs, it is Horizon’s opinion that
these proposed improvements associated with the overall Oak Lane WWTP improvement
project will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no further investigations are
warranted. Similarly, as the Oak Lane collection system rehabilitation will occur within existing,
previously disturbed ROWs and will utilize pipebursting in place of excavation to facilitate the
waterline replacements, it is also Horizon’s opinion that this component of the overall Oak Lane
WWTP improvement project will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no
further investigations are warranted. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the entire undertaking. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
