INTRODUCTION
Brazos Valley Research Associates was retained by the City of Bryan to conduct
a 100% Phase I cultural resources survey for the proposed Austin's Estates Sanitary
Sewer Line in central Brazos County (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on United
States Geological Survey topographical map, Bryan East, dated 1962 and photorevised
in 1980 (Figure 2). This map is out of date and does not depict many of the current
improvements such as the Austin's Colony Subdivision, Harvey Mitchell Elementary
School, and Austin's Colony Parkway just to the south of the current project area. The
proposed sewer line is 7000 feet in length with a permanent easement of 20 feet. It
begins at an existing sewer connection, travels overland, and terminates at Old
Reliance Road (Figure 3). When converted to acres, the project area is 3.26 acres in
size. An 18 inch pipe will be placed in a 12 foot wide trench with an average depth of 412 feet. No federal regulatory agency is involved in this project which was reviewed at
the State level by the Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission. Since the
construction of this sewer line is being financed by a local municipality, an Antiquities
Permit was required, and permit number 2443 was assigned to this project.
The project area parallels a tributary of Carters Creek to the east. Most of the
route of the proposed sewer line is situated in an active floodplain adjacent to the creek.
Based on an examination of the route of the sewer line as depicted on the topographic
map, parts of the project area were considered to be medium to high probability areas in
terms of containing significant prehistoric and/or historic sites, thereby warranting an
archaeological survey.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). This
physiographic section is subdivided according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated
within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized
by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acid sandy loams or
sands. The climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for the county is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees and a July maximum temperature of 95 degrees
combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and Harris 1983:180). The
altitude varies from 200-400 feet. No soils book is currently available for Brazos County.
Soils data were obtained from the local field office of the Natural Resources
Conservation Service in Bryan. Specific soil types encountered in the project area are
discussed in the Results and Conclusions section of this report.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
A check of the records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas revealed no archeological sites have been recorded within the current
project area. It was discovered that sites have been recorded in the region, and several
significant archaeological investigations have been performed in Brazos County.
Prehistoric sites in this area are typically found on sandy ridges and uplands in close
proximity to dependable sources of water such as creeks and rivers. No prehistoric
sites in the county have been reported on clay hills or in active floodplains. Prehistoric
site 41BZ130 was found by Brazos Valley Research Associates in 1999 on the main
channel of Carters Creek approximately 600 meters south of the southern end of the
proposed sewer line (Moore 1999). It is a low density, buried lithic scatter on a sandy
terrace that yielded only one dart point and three flakes in 14 shovel tests. This site
was not considered significant, and no further work was recommended.
The project area is also in an area of historical significance. The Richard Carter
site (41BZ74), about eight miles south of the project area, represents the earliest
historic settlement in the county at circa 1831 (Carlson 1983, 1987). The town of
Boonville (41BZ91), including Boonville Cemetery, is about 1500 meters to the south.
Boonville was the first county seat of Brazos County and was established in 1841
(Webb 1952:188). These two sites are an indication of the potential of the project area
for containing evidence of early historic occupation.

FIELD METHODS
The project area was examined on August 8, 2000 utilizing the pedestrian survey
method. The entire route was walked by the field crew and examined by shovel tests
and probes. Prior to the field survey, sections of the sewer line route were considered
to be medium to high probability areas for the presence of archaeological sites. This
assessment was based on the route as depicted on the topographic map. However, in
the field it was discovered that the sewer line route did not cross any high probability
landforms. Most of the route is in an active floodplain of the creek and along the lower
slopes of ridges with a significant portion in the creek channel. Therefore, shovel tests
were concentrated in areas where sandy soil was present. The shovel probes were
used to identify areas where clay was at or very near the surface. Probes differ from
tests in that they are not screened. Ten shovel probes were excavated. Originally, it
was stated in the permit application that shovel tests would be dug at 30 meter intervals
or less in high probability areas and 100 meter intervals throughout the rest of the
project area route. Once in the field, however, the overall low potential for
archaeological sites was identified. This changed the strategy to digging shovel tests in
areas where sandy soil was observed or on potential landforms as depicted on the
topographic map. Many potential shovel tests were reduced to probes once the shallow
nature of the sandy soil was realized. Shovel tests were dug to clay. The size of each
test was 30 x 50 centimeters and varied in depth from 30 to 50 centimeters below the
existing ground surface. All excavated fill was screened through 1/4 inch hardware
cloth. Shovel test data were recorded on a shovel test log (Appendix I). In all, nine
shovel tests were dug, and each test was backfilled.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been recorded in the project area. There was also
no indication that any part of the project area had been surveyed by professional
archaeologists. The records search revealed the presence of prehistoric and historic
utilization in the area (see Archaeological Background above) as evidenced by
prehistoric site 41BZ130, the nearby town of Boonville (1841) and the Richard Carter
homestead (circa 1830s).
The soils in the project area consisted mainly of Sandow loam, frequently flooded
(Sa), Tabor fine sandy loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes (TaA), and Zulch fine sandy loam, 1
to 3 percent slopes (ZuB) as depicted on Sheet 21 for the Brazos County soil survey
which is in preparation. Sandow loam is a moderately slowly permeable soil in
floodplains of drainage ways. This soil formed in slightly acid to moderately alkaline
stratified sandy and loamy sediments. The surface layer is dark brown clay loam about
8 inches thick. The shovel tests and probes in this soil revealed a dark gray clay at the
surface.
Tabor fine sandy loam covers about 50% of the project area. This soil consists
of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils on uplands. Tabor
soils have grayish-brown and very pale brown fine sandy loam surface layers and
brownish-yellow clayey subsoil that is mottled with gray, light gray, and yellowish-red.
The soils formed in acid to alkaline clays and sandy clays with sandier materials. The
shovel tests in this soil revealed a fine sandy loam over dark gray clay between 30 and
50 cm.
Zulch fine sandy loam is found at the extreme northern end of the project area.
This soil consists of moderately deep to weathered shale, moderately well drained, very
slowly permeable, nearly level to gently sloping soils on uplands. The surface to 5
inches is a dark grayish brown fine sandy loam. From 5 to 13 inches this soil is very
dark grayish-brown clay with few brownish mottles. The shovel tests and in this area
revealed a fine sandy loam over dark gray clay at 30 cm.
No archaeological sites were found in the project area. There are several
reasons that explain the absence of prehistoric sites. First, the route parallels a
tributary of Carters Creek that diminishes in size and importance to the north. In fact,
this tributary ends just a few hundred meters north of the northern end of the project
area. The main channel of Carters Creek is viewed as an area more likely to contain
prehistoric settlement. Second, the route of the pipeline as proposed by the City of
Bryan does not cross the apex of any upland ridges or terraces. As marked in the field,
this route traverses the project area very close to the channel of the tributary. In many
places, the route is on the slope, within the active floodplain of the tributary, or in the
actual creek channel.

Third, the few areas containing sandy soil had a clay stratum within 50 cm or less
below the existing ground surface. Overall, it is estimated that 60% of the project area
is in active floodplain, 20% is in low-lying areas with several creek crossings, and 20%
is on the lower slopes of frequently flooded terrain.

RECOMMENDATIONS
It is the opinion of Brazos Valley Research Associates that there are no
archaeological sites within the route of the proposed sanitary sewer line. Therefore, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible
that archaeological sites are missed during any cultural resources survey. Should areas
containing prehistoric or historic artifacts not discussed in this report be discovered
during construction, Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission, must be notified
immediately and all work stopped in the area of concern until the situation can be
evaluated.
