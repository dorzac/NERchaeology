MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Between 26 and 29 October 2010, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 479.33 acres comprising the US Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional areas within the proposed 900.0-acre Formula One
Race Track Development in Austin, Travis County, Texas (Project Area). Although the Project
Area is located on private property and funded by private sources, impacts to the USACE
jurisdictional areas will require the usage of a Nationwide Permit (NWP), which is issued by the
USACE in compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1976. As a NWP is a federal
permit, the areas within the purview of the USACE also fall under the regulations of Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Horizon conducted the
intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of Accelerator Holdings, LLC,
in compliance with the regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was
to determine if any cultural resources were located within the Project Area and, if so, to
determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In all,
the USACE jurisdictional areas investigated within the following report total 479.33 acres.
The survey of the 479.33-acre Project Area resulted in the documentation of 2 historic
farmsteads (41TV2386 and 41TV2387) and 1 prehistoric lithic procurement area (site
41TV2388). Based on the lack of integrity and the lack of potential for buried, stratified cultural
deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that all 3 sites do not qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under
Criteria A and D. Similarly, based on the lack of association of sites 41TV2386 and 41TV2387
with a person or event of historical significance, it is Horizon’s opinion that these 2 sites also do
not qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under Criterion B and C. As such, it is Horizon’s overall
opinion that sites 41TV2386, 41TV2387, and 41TV2388 are all ineligible for inclusion on the
NRHP and that no further investigations are warranted at these sites.
Based on the results of the intensive cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the development of the Project Area will pose no adverse impacts to significant cultural
resources and that no further investigations are warranted. Therefore, Horizon recommends
that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the 479.33
acres comprising the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) jurisdictional areas within the
proposed 900.0-acre Formula One Race Track Development located in southeastern Travis
County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 and 2). Although the Project Area is located on private
property and funded by private sources, impacts to areas under the jurisdiction of the USACE
will require the usage of a Nationwide Permit (NWP), which is issued by the USACE in
compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act of 1976. As a NWP is a federal permit, the
areas within the purview of the USACE also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Horizon conducted the
intensive cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of Accelerator Holdings, LLC,
in compliance with the regulations of Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was
to determine if any cultural resources were located within the Project Area and, if so, to
determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). In all,
the USACE jurisdictional areas investigated within the following report total 479.33 acres.
The cultural resources investigation consisted of initial consultation with the USACE to
determine exactly what areas of the overall 900.0 acres were considered to be under the
jurisdiction of the USACE, an archival review, an intensive pedestrian survey of the Project
Area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer
(SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and
Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines
for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Reymundo Chapa served as Principal
Investigator, and he, Jared Wiersema, and Courtney Coffey (archeological field technicians)
conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area between 26 and 29 October 2010.
The field investigations consisted of an intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel
testing throughout the Project Area. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards
(TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 3 acres on projects over 200 acres in size.
As such, the 479.33 acres comprising the Project Area required a total of 160 shovel tests to
comply with the TSMASS. Horizon conducted 175 shovel tests within the Project Area,
exceeding the minimum survey standards.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The survey of the 479.33-acre Project Area resulted in the documentation of 2 historic
farmsteads (41TV2386 and 41TV2387) and 1 prehistoric lithic procurement area (site
41TV2388). Site 41TV2386 consists of a razed house with an associated fenced coral and
outbuilding foundation made of concrete. The farmstead is surrounded by scattered debris
ranging in date from the early to late 1900s. Site 41TV2387 consists of a collapsed farmstead
that has been partially destroyed by recent clearing activities. This farmstead is also
surrounded by scattered debris ranging in date from the early to late 1900s. Site 41TV2388 is a
prehistoric hilltop lithic procurement area consisting of numerous pieces of lithic debitage, 1
bifacial specimen, and 1 chert core. Based on the lack of integrity and the lack of potential for
buried, stratified cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that all 3 sites do not qualify for
inclusion on the NRHP under Criteria A and D. Similarly, based on the lack of association of
sites 41TV2386 and 41TV2387 with a person or event of historical significance, it is Horizon’s
opinion that these 2 sites also do not qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under Criterion B and C.
As such, it is Horizon’s overall opinion that sites 41TV2386, 41TV2387, and 41TV2388 are all
ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP and that no further investigations are warranted at these
sites.
Based on the results of the intensive cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the development of the Project Area will pose no adverse impacts to significant cultural
resources and that no further investigations are warranted. Therefore, Horizon recommends
that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking. However, in the unlikely event
that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during the development of the Project Area, even in previously surveyed
areas, all work at the location of the find should cease immediately and the THC should be
notified of the discovery. Additionally, if future development is initiated in the northeastern
portion of the property, beyond the limits of the current USACE jurisdiction for the development,
Horizon recommends that an intensive cultural resources survey be conducted before any
ground-disturbing activities begin.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area consists of a 479.33-acre tract located approximately 12.3 miles (19.8
kilometers [km]) southeast of the City of Austin, in southeast Travis County, Texas. It can be
found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5’ topographic Montopolis (USGS 1988) and
Weberville (USGS 1987) quadrangles (see Figure 1). The Project Area will consist primarily of
a German-designed Formula One Track and its associated constructions. Currently, the Project
Area is vacant rangeland with active natural gas pipeline and electric transmission line
easements, and cattle were grazing throughout the property at the time of the cultural survey.
The Project Area is bounded to the north by Elroy Road, to the east by McAngus Road and to
the west by Elroy Road. Photographs of the general property are provided in Figures 3 through
8.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area consists generally of ridged landforms composed of severely eroded
gravely clay. The southeastern portion of the Project Area contains hilltops and steep ridges
that range in elevation from approximately 500.0 to 630.0 feet above mean sea level (amsl)
(USGS 1987 and 1988). The ridges decrease in elevation from east to west, where the lowest
elevation is approximately 450.0 feet amsl (USGS 1987 and 1988). The Project Area is located
within the Suburban Zone of the Dry Creek Watershed (COA 1998) and drainage occurs by
overland sheet flow in an east-to-west direction towards Dry Creek. In turn, Dry Creek flows
approximately 9.7 miles (15.5 km) northeast to the Colorado River.

2.3

GEOLOGY AND SOILS

A review of existing literature shows that the site is underlain by the Navarro group,
Quaternary high terrace deposits, and Quaternary alluvial deposits (Proctor et al. 1981). The
Navarro geologic group is composed of calcareous clay and marl. Both the Corsicana and
Kemp geologic formations are included in the Navarro Group. The Corsicana Formation
represents a maximum thickness of approximately 120.0 feet. It is dark gray to blue-gray in
color, and is poorly dispersed throughout the Austin area. Located at the base of this formation
is admixed sand and phosphatic material. The Kemp geologic formation is described as
montmorillonitic clay with calcareous intervals. It is dark gray or brown in color, and quartz
siltstone is common between the Corsicana and the bottom of the Kemp Formation. The

maximum thickness of the Kemp Formation is approximately 350.0 feet. Quaternary high
terrace deposits are described as unconsolidated gravel, sand, silt, and clay. Quaternary
alluvial deposits consist of unconsolidated sand, silt, gravel, clay, and cobbles (Garner and
Young 1976).
A total of 6 soil types are mapped within the 479.33-acre Project Area. These soils are
described below in Table 1, and their distribution is mapped in Figure 9 (NRCS 2010):

In general, the geomorphological conditions that prevail within the Project Area suggest
that any cultural resources would be constrained to the modern ground surface or in erosional
settings that lack integrity, rather than in buried contexts. Erosion processes are typical of the
Project Area, and no deep alluvial sediments with the potential of containing buried, intact
archeological deposits are mapped therein. All things being equal, any cultural resources
associated with the soils mapped in the Project Area would be expected to occur on the modern
ground surface in deflated, eroded contexts that lack stratigraphic integrity.

VEGETATION

The Project Area is situated within the Blackland Prairie vegetational area of Texas
(Gould 1975). Vegetation is dominated by scrubby woodlands, of which honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa) is the dominant species. Other vegetation observed throughout the
subject site includes giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), sunflower (Helianthus annuus), prickly
pear (Opuntia lindheimeri), frostweed (Verbesina virginica), Tasajillo cactus (Opuntia
leptocaulis), and southern dewberry (Rubus trivialis). Several drainage associated on-channel
stock ponds and upland stock ponds are located within the Project Area. Within these areas the
vegetation most often includes black willow (Salix nigra), fiddle dock (Rumex pulcher), water
primrose (Ludwigia sp.), rattlebush (Sesbania drummondii), spikerush (Eleocharis sp.),
flatsedge (Cyperus sp.), arrowhead (Sagittaria platyphylla), bulrush (Scirpus sp.), spiny cocklebur (Xanthium spinosum), frog-fruit (Phyla sp.), balloon vine (Cardiospermum sp.), southern
dewberry (Rubus trivialis), and various sedges (Carex spp.).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
Paleo-Indian, 11,200 to 8000 BP; Archaic, 8000 to 1400 BP; and Late Prehistoric, 1400 to 400
BP. A brief breakdown of this general sequence is presented below.

3.1

PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,200 TO 8000 BP)

The Paleo-Indian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth,
bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and Plainview stages,
subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game,
particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working
locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been documented (Collins
1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer
and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8000 TO 1400 BP)

The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is
divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late (3000
to 1400 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar
transition found world-wide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the
extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual
decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends
first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic
changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the
case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued.
Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller areas than
did the Paleo-Indian groups.
3.2.1

Early Archaic (8000 to 5000 BP)

The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
Paleo-Indian lanceolate-shaped points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the Early
Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed that,
prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in
terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyonlands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests that mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late Paleo-Indian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).
3.2.2

Middle Archaic (5000 to 3000 BP)

The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw 1985:38).
Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones Escarpment
region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant regional
resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early
part of the Middle Archaic gave way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens (Collins
1995).
These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different

12

100102_arch_survey_report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the USACE Jurisdictional Areas within the Proposed Formula
One Race Track Development, Travis County, Texas

subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs have
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.
3.2.3

Late Archaic (3000 to 1400 BP)

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into 2
subperiods (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at site 41WM815 and dated between
2800 to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock
middens on the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in
any other period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a
result of the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

such as sotol and yucca—foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens)
in order to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely
resulted in the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which would have in turn attracted herds of
buffalo. Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an
increase in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile-making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1400 TO 400 BP)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin phase is characterized
by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow
points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 400 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis and Collins 1994) as well as increased
participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that
heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian
population was greatly diminished.
The Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache Indians were well established in Central Texas by
the 14th century, and Comanche and Kiowa tribes arrived in the area by the 18th century 1 . The
first European known to have crossed the region was Domingo Terán de los Ríos, who made an
inspection tour to East Texas in 1691. When the Spanish moved their missions out of East
Texas in 1730, they relocated the missions of San Francisco de los Neches, Nuestra Señora de
la Purísima Concepción de los Hasinai, and San José de los Nazonis to locations near Barton
Springs. In 1827, the Mexican government granted Stephen F. Austin his third colony, Little
Colony, which was located east of the Colorado River and north and west of the Old San
Antonio Road. Mina (later Bastrop) became the headquarters of the colony, and Travis County
developed as an offshoot of Mina. Settlers moving into the area in the early 1830s included
Josiah and Mathias Wilbarger, Reuben Hornsby, Jacob M. Harrell, and John F. Webber. The
onset of the Texas Revolution delayed further settlement activity, and the news of the fall of the
Alamo prompted those settlers already in residence to flee.
Settlement resumed after the revolution, but it proceeded slowly because of the constant
threat of raids by the Comanche Indians. During the 1830s, a chain of small forts extended
from Bastrop northwest along Wilbarger’s Bend, Coleman Branch, Webber’s Prairie, and
Gilleland Creek, to Fort Colorado or Fort Prairie, 8 km (5 miles) east of the site of present-day
Austin. In June 1835, Thomas Jefferson Chambers surveyed part of an 8-league grant covering
the present-day site of Austin and the capitol. Sometime before 1837, William Barton settled
near the springs that were to bear his name. In 1837 or 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar
was on a buffalo hunt in the area and commented on its possibilities as a permanent site for the
capital. In 1838, the community of Waterloo (later Austin) consisted of 4 families, and about
20 families established homes at nearby Montopolis in 1839. When the Congress of the
Republic of Texas chose Waterloo as the site of the new capital, opponents were quick to point
out the disadvantages—the site's proximity to the frontier, the lack of timber, the poor soil, and
the threat of Indian raids. In spite of this opposition, however, the new capital—renamed Austin

in honor of Stephen F. Austin—was approved on 19 January 1840. A few days later, the
Congress established Travis County, naming it in honor of William Barret Travis and making
Austin its county seat. An election for county officials was held in February 1840, at which time
the population was reported to be 856. The initial boundaries of Travis County included roughly
40,000 square miles. Counties that were later carved from Travis County include Callahan
(1858), Coleman (1858), Comal (1846), Gillespie (1848), Hays (1848), Burnet (1852), Brown
(1856), Lampasas (1856), Eastland (1858), Runnels (1858), and Taylor (1858). Sam Houston
moved the government of the Republic of Texas from Austin to Houston when Mexican troops
invaded San Antonio in March 1842. When he tried to have the government archives removed
as well, Austin citizens resisted with the Archives War. The Texas Congress held sessions at
Washington-on-the-Brazos from 1842 to 1845, but the convention that drafted the Constitution
of 1845 met in Austin in July 1845, and by October the rest of the government had returned to
the capital city. The first legislature of the new state convened in Austin in February 1846.
The late 1840s and early 1850s were building years for Austin and Travis County, with
much of the growth fed by the presence of the state government—the Governor's Mansion,
office buildings, hotels, new homes, and newspapers. In 1850, Travis County had a population
of 3,138, of whom 2,336 were white, 791 were slaves, and 11 were free blacks; by 1860, the
number of residents had more than doubled to 8,080, with 4,931 of them white, 3,136 slaves,
and 13 free blacks. Although the city of Austin grew faster than the county as a whole—its
population rose from 629 in 1850 to 3,494 in 1860—most county residents lived in small
communities. Pflugerville and Del Valle were the most prominent of these communities, but
rural post offices were also established at Bluff Springs, Webberville, Merrilltown, Gilleland,
Cage’s Mill, and Hornsby Bend. During the 1850s, the amount of land in farms in what was
then Travis County increased from 73,300 acres to 1,363,500 acres. Corn was the primary field
crop, while cattle and sheep were the principal livestock. In 1860, farmers produced
137,700 bushels of corn and 27,900 bushels of wheat and had 58,000 cattle and 11,800 sheep.
The earliest schools in Travis County were private institutions that usually met in private
homes or in space donated by a church or Masonic lodge. More elaborate private facilities
began to appear by the late 1840s, including Colorado Female College in 1848, Austin Male
and Female Academy in 1849, Austin Female Academy in 1850, and Austin Collegiate Female
Institute in 1852. By 1850, Travis County also had 6 public schools serving a scholastic
population of 183. The county was divided into 19 common school districts in 1852. The state
established the Asylum for the Blind in Austin in 1856 and the Deaf and Dumb School in 1857.
Travis County became a center for higher education in the 1880s with the establishment of the
University of Texas in 1881, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute in 1881, and Saint
Edward's University in 1885. Samuel Huston College began holding classes in the 1890s. The
Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary opened in 1902, Texas Wesleyan College Academy
in 1912, Concordia Lutheran College in 1926, and the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the
Southwest in 1952. Austin Community College began operations in 1972. The availability of
schools resulted in a high level of education for a large portion of the county’s population. In the
1940s, while more rural areas of the state reported that less than 10% of their population over
the age of 25 had high school diplomas, nearly 20% of Travis County residents had graduated.
By 1980, that number had jumped to 75%.

The earliest churches in Travis County were the Catholic missions relocated to the area
by the Spanish in 1730, but these were moved to San Antonio in 1731, and it was more than a
century before any organized religious practices were firmly established. In the 1830s, a variety
of religious groups began to appear—Methodist circuit riders held services along Gilleland
Creek in 1837 or 1838; Presbyterians organized a church in Austin in October 1839; Mormons
settled near Fort Coleman, Webberville, and Hornsby Bend in the late 1830s; and Catholic
priests, among them Jean Marie Odin, returned to the area in 1840. A Baptist church and a
Church of Christ were organized in Austin in 1847, a Lutheran church was established in New
Sweden and a Jewish synagogue in Austin began in 1876, and a Christian Science church
formed in Austin in 1889. In the early 1980s, Travis County’s 266 churches had an estimated
combined membership of 194,194; Catholic, Southern Baptist, and United Methodist were the
largest denominations.
In spite of the rapid growth that Travis County experienced during the 1850s, the area
was at that time still very much at the edge of the frontier. The absence of railroads meant that
goods had to be shipped by wagon to and from Houston and Port Lavaca, and poor roads
meant that goods sometimes could not be shipped at all. In 1852, the Austin Railroad
Association was established to encourage railroad construction to the area, and considerable
progress had been made by the late 1850s; however, the Civil War intervened, and work on
railroad acquisition was postponed. The Secession Convention convened in Austin on
28 January 1861. Although a group of Austin citizens staged a demonstration in favor of
secession, Unionist sentiment was high, and Travis County residents voted against secession,
704 to 450. Nevertheless, when the Civil War began, Travis County provided several hundred
volunteers, among them the Travis Rifles, the Tom Green Rifles, the Capitol Guard, and the
Austin City Light Infantry. In the 2 months between the end of the war and the arrival of federal
troops in the county, looting of farms and businesses was common. Although the inevitable
clashes between the Unionist forces and the former rebels resulted in the arrest of as many as
30 people per day, the presence of federal troops served to curb much of the lawlessness. By
early 1866, most of the federal soldiers had been mustered out of service, leaving only about
200 men to police the Austin area until the end of the military occupation in 1870. Austin was
the site of the constitutional conventions of 1866 and 1868-69 and witnessed both the removal
of Governor James W. Throckmorton in 1867 and the Coke-Davis Controversy in 1874. In the
gubernatorial election of 1869, Travis County residents favored Andrew J. Hamilton to Edmund
J. Davis by a margin of 798 to 593.
Like most areas in the south, Travis County suffered considerable economic hardship
immediately after the Civil War and throughout the Reconstruction period. Between 1864 and
1866, the county as a whole experienced a 49% loss in property tax receipts. Roughly 2/3 of
this property loss was in slaves, with the rest coming from declines in farm and livestock values,
each of which fell 25 to 40%. The county began to show signs of recovery by 1880. The overall
population rose from 13,153 in 1870 to 27,028 in 1880, and the 1880 census reported
1,912 farms, an increase of 656 over the 1870 totals. The amount of improved land rose from
83,200 acres in 1870 to 139,800 in 1880. Field crops such as corn, cotton, wheat, and oats
took up nearly half of the improved farmland, while livestock dominated the rest.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Economic recovery was facilitated by the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central
Railway, which completed its track to Austin in 1871, and the International and Great Northern
Railroad, which was built between Rockdale and Austin in 1876 and completed from Austin to
Laredo in 1881. The Austin and Northwestern Railroad laid track between Austin and Burnet in
1882, and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas line arrived in 1904. Communities besides Austin
that benefited directly from easy railroad access included Pflugerville, Manor, Oak Hill, and
Manchaca. After the war, many former slaves remained in the area. In the year after the war,
the black population increased by 60%, while the white population rose by only 12%. By 1870,
black residents numbered 4,647, comprising 35% of the county's total population. Clarksville,
Kincheonville, Masontown, and Wheatville were among the communities established by former
slaves. The number of black residents in Travis County continued to increase steadily, reaching
13,299 in 1900. It fluctuated between 13,000 and 15,000 from 1900 to 1930, but increased
rapidly thereafter, rising to 22,493 in 1950, 32,270 in 1970, and 63,173 in 1990. Because other
segments of the population grew at an even faster rate, the percentage of black residents, with
respect to the total population, declined significantly, falling to 20% by 1930 and 11% by 1990.
Contributing to the shift in the ethnic makeup of the county was a variety of immigrant groups,
the most prominent of which were German, Swedish, and Mexican. By the turn of the century,
8% of the population was composed of natives of 1 of these countries. Although the early
Swedish and German settlers contributed to the diversity of Travis County through their religious
and educational institutions, the Mexican influence was also reinforced by the continued arrival
of large numbers of new immigrants fleeing the unrest of the Mexican Revolution in the early
20th century. The 1930 census reported that 10,225 residents, or 13% of the county’s total
population, were of Hispanic descent; by 1990, the number of Hispanic residents had risen to
121,689, or 21%.
In 1890, Travis County had 36,322 residents. Of these, 14,575 lived in Austin, which
was fast outgrowing its efforts to become a modern city. Innovations and improvements in
progress at that time included a trolley system and water-generated electricity, but most of its
streets remained unpaved. By the turn of the century several hundred assorted businesses
filled the needs of the 22,000 Austin residents. Yet, in spite of this rapid increase in Austin’s
population, the majority of the county’s residents lived on farms or in smaller towns, and
agriculture dominated the area economy. Cotton became the principal field crop in the late
1880s and remained so for more than 60 years. The 1890 census reported 65,000 acres—
nearly 30% of the county's improved farmland—planted in cotton; by the turn of the century, the
amount of land devoted to cotton had increased to 113,300 acres, or 56% of the improved
farmland. However, as more marginal land was used and the soil became depleted, production
levels fell; in 1930, 143,000 acres produced only 19,000 bales. By the late 1950s, cotton
accounted for only 26% of the total cropland harvested, and by 1980 it had fallen to only 8%.
Farm tenancy had increased steadily since the 1890s and peaked in 1930, with tenants
operating 2/3 of the 3,642 farms. The number of farms fell by more than 1,000 in the 1930s, as
many tenant farmers either moved away or turned to other occupations. Farmers who remained
in the area began to devote more of their resources to crops other than cotton and to livestock.
The number of cattle increased from 32,000 in 1920 and to 51,000 in 1950; the number of
sheep and goats increased as well, boosting wool and mohair production from 23,600 and

18

4,292 pounds, respectively, in 1920, and to 127,800 and 183,600 pounds in 1959. By the late
1960s, hay and sorghum combined to account for 60% of the cropland harvested.
The Great Depression was slow to hit Travis County, but, by the mid-1930s, many
people were unemployed and very glad of the New Deal programs that resulted in work paving
streets; building bridges, sewers, and parks; and constructing the tower of the University of
Texas campus. In part because of the job opportunities made available through relief projects,
state government, and the university community, the population increased by 43% in the 1930s,
rising from 77,777 in 1930 to 111,053 in 1940. One major job-producing project in the 1930s
was the construction of a series of dams on the Colorado River. Austin and Travis County had
begun efforts to tame the Colorado as early as 1869, when the army built a pontoon bridge
across the river. In 1893, the City of Austin completed a dam designed to provide power for its
water and electrical systems. By 1899, the city was already experiencing power shortfalls, and
a major flood in 1900 destroyed the dam. Another flood in 1915 washed out the repairs that
were underway, and the project was abandoned. The flood of 1935 put much of downtown
Austin under water, and the area’s interest in a lasting flood-control system was renewed. The
Lower Colorado River Authority was established and a series of dams was built, forming Lake
Austin, Lake Travis, Lake Buchanan, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, Inks Lake, and Lake Marble
Falls. Travis County also profited from the establishment of several military bases. Camp
Mabry in northwest Austin, established as the main Texas National Guard facility in 1890,
served as an army training center during World War I. After the US became involved in World
War II, the Del Valle Army Air Base, soon renamed Bergstrom Army Air Field, was established
in southeast Travis County. After the war was over, the presence of military personnel
continued to bring changes to the county. Thousands of returning veterans enrolled in the local
colleges and universities, greatly increasing the student population as well as intensifying the
demand for housing and the growth of service industries.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Travis County underwent 2 significant developments. The first
of these was desegregation. The Sweatt v. Painter decision in 1950 pushed the University of
Texas to the forefront in the fight for civil rights, leading it to become the first southern university
to admit blacks as undergraduates, although it was not until 1962 that all of the university’s
facilities were fully integrated. Public schools in Travis County began to follow suit in 1955.
Local Mexican-American organizations also achieved a measure of success against
discriminatory practices. Some local businesses resisted these changes, prompting strikes and
protests in the 1960s, but in the end desegregation was accomplished without the violence
prevalent in other urban areas of the country. The change became even more visible as blacks
and Hispanics were elected to public office—Wilhelmina Delco to the school board in 1968 and
to the Texas House of Representatives in 1976; Berl Handcox to the Austin city council in 1971;
Richard Moya to the Travis County commissioner’s court in 1970; and Gonzalo Barrientos to the
Texas House of Representatives in 1974.
The second major development was the
establishment of several high-tech industries. In 1951, a small, local company became Texas
Instruments, and in 1955 Tracor, Incorporated, made Austin its base of operations.
International Business Machines opened an Austin branch in 1967, followed by Motorola in
1974. These companies, along with Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation
(1983), Dell Computers (1984), and Sematech (1988), became the county’s largest employers.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

From the end of Reconstruction to the present, most Travis County residents chose to
support Democratic presidential candidates, with exceptions in 1896, 1928, 1952, 1956, 1972,
and 1984. Occasionally, a third-party candidate drew a sizable portion of the vote, but only 3 of
them—the Greenback-Labor candidate in 1880, George Wallace in 1968, and John Anderson in
1984—garnered sufficient support to affect the county’s overall election results. In state
elections, Travis County residents were staunchly Democratic. In the early 1980s, 63% of the
land in Travis County was devoted to farms and ranches. About 23% of the farmland was under
cultivation, with sorghum, hay, wheat, and cotton accounting for nearly 70% of the 94,000 acres
harvested; other crops included potatoes, sweet potatoes, peaches, and pecans. Sixty-six
percent of the county’s $32 million in agricultural receipts came from livestock and livestock
products, the most important ones being cattle, milk, sheep, wool, and hogs. Although
agriculture remained an important aspect of the local economy, farm receipts were greatly
surpassed by the income generated by non-agricultural industries. Professional and related
services, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and government administration involved
70% of the work force in the 1980s; of the rest, 7% were self-employed and 3% employed
outside the county. Since shortly after the turn of the century, the majority of Travis County
residents had resided in the City of Austin. The jobs made available by the growth of the hightech industries reinforced that trend, and, by 1970, 85% of the 295,516 residents lived in the
capital city. In the 1970s and 1980s, however, residential development near Lake Travis
encouraged many people to move away from the city, and although Austin continued to grow at
a rapid pace, the number of residents choosing to live near the lake and in northern and
southern suburbs increased at an even faster rate. By 1990, Lago Vista (2,199), Jonestown
(1,250), Briarcliff (335), Lakeway (4,044), and Pflugerville (4,444) in Travis County, as well as
Round Rock and even Georgetown in Williamson County, had become popular alternatives to
living in Austin. Like the rest of Texas, Travis County weathered a serious economic downturn
in the mid-1980s; newly-built office space sat empty, and many people lost their jobs. Added to
this was news that Bergstrom Air Force Base was scheduled to close. In the early 1990s,
however, plans were underway to convert the Bergstrom site into a new municipal airport, and
the county was looking forward to a period of growth. The population of Travis County was
reported at 576,407 in 1990, an increase of 37% from 1980. Among the area’s most prevalent
concerns was that future growth should not destroy the ecological balance of environmentally
sensitive areas in the western hills.

One Race Track Development, Travis County, Texas

5.0 METHODOLOGY

Prior to conducting the field investigations, Horizon consulted with Mr. Skipper Scott of
the USACE, Fort Worth District. Although the overall tract totals approximately 900.0 acres,
impacts associated with the proposed Formula One track are contained within the approximate
southeastern half of the tract. As such, Mr. Scott indicated that the USACE would only be
taking jurisdiction over the 479.33 acres where the development is currently proposed. These
479.33 acres comprise what is defined as the Project Area within this document.
Subsequent to the consultation with the USACE, a Horizon archeological field crew
completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the Project Area between 26 and 29 October
2010. Field investigations consisted of an intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel
testing throughout the Project Area. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards
(TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 3.0 acres on projects over 200.0 acres in
size. As such, the 479.33 acres comprising the Project Area required a total of 160 shovel tests
to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon conducted 175 shovel tests within the Project Area,
exceeding the minimum survey standards.
In order to maximize the effect of shovel testing within the 479.33-acre Project Area, field
crews devised a strategy that concentrated efforts into 5 particular zones (Figure 11). These
zones delineate topographic features that represent the most likely places in which cultural
resources were expected to be encountered. In Central Texas, aboriginal archeological sites
are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near stream/river channels and
springs. Due to the moderate density of previously recorded archeological sites north of the
current Project Area (see Figure 10) and the Project Area’s relative proximity to the Colorado
River, the area held at least moderate potential to contain prehistoric cultural resources.
However, the Project Area is also situated in an erosional setting characterized by gravely clay
sediments that overlie limestone bedrock on an ancient, Pleistocene-age alluvial terrace
remnant. No Holocene-age sediments with the potential to contain intact archeological deposits
are mapped in the Project Area. As such, any cultural resources within the Project Area would
be expected to occur on the modern ground surface in deflated, eroded contexts or in shallowly
buried contexts lacking stratigraphic integrity. Therefore, particular attention and priority was
given to the visual inspection of surface-born material. Historic-age cultural resources occur in
virtually all physiographic settings, but they are commonly found near major towns and adjacent
to historic-age roadways.

cultural resources within Project Area (USGS 1987 and 1988)
A selective-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. If any nondiagnostic cultural materials (e.g., shell, lithic debitage, etc.) were observed on the surface or
within shovel tests, they were to be tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently
returned to where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points,
charcoal, historic materials with maker’s marks, etc.) were to be collected for analysis and
further documentation. Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms,
shovel tests, cultural material observed (if any), etc. Digital photographs with a photo log were
also completed as appropriate. A handheld GPS unit utilizing the UTM coordinate system and
the NAD 83 map datum was used to record pertinent location data. The locations of the
excavated shovel tests are presented in Figure 12. Shovel test data are provided in Appendix
A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The cultural resources survey resulted in the documentation of 2 abandoned historic
farmsteads (sites 41TV2386 and 41TV2387) and 1 prehistoric hilltop lithic procurement area
(site 41TV2388). Each of these sites is described in detail below.
6.1.1

Site 41TV2386

General Site Description
Site 41TV2386 was documented as a small historic farmstead located north of Piland
Triangle, a road that defines a portion of Project Area’s southern boundary (Figures 13 and 14).
Based on the extent of features and specimens, the overall dimensions of the site span
approximately 50 meters (m) (164.0 feet [ft]) north-south by 40 m (131.2 ft) east-west. The site
is located on a flat hilltop that reduces to a thin ridge that slopes gently into an unnamed
drainage to the north. In turn, this drainage flows further north to Dry Creek, located
approximately 0.5 miles (0.8 km) northwest of the site.
Observed Cultural Features on Site 41TV2386
The central feature of site 41TV2386 is the remnants of a house structure that has been
razed and pushed into a central refuse pile (Figures 15 and 16). The pile measures
approximately 5.0 m (16.4 ft) by 10.0 m (32.8 ft) in size and includes fragments of dimensional
lumber, corrugated metal, bricks, barbed wire, cinderblocks, and modern-aged plastic trash
(Figure 17). Approximately 20.0 m (65.6 ft) north of the refuse pile is the crumbling foundation
of an outbuilding that has no standing structural elements (Figure 18). The foundation
measures roughly 2.5 m (8.2 ft) by 2.5 m in size.
Approximately 30 m (98.4 ft) southwest of the refuse pile, along the fence that delineates
a portion of the Project Area’s southern boundary, is a fenced coral made of cedar posts that
measures approximately 5.0 m (16.4 ft) by 10.0 m (32.8 ft) (Figure 19). The coral is located on
the western side of a barbed wire fence that runs along the western periphery of site 41TV2386.
Because most of the fence has deteriorated, it is difficult to assess whether the area to the west
of the fence was a separate property, or whether the property was owned and operated by the
residents of the remnant farmstead. A tubular metal gate (Figure 20) accesses site 41TV2386

from Piland Triangle, and a north-south oriented 2-track dirt road enters the property from the
gate and passes through the site’s western perimeter, approximately 15.0 m (49.2 ft) west of the
razed farmstead.
Deed Research
The property on which site 41TV2386 is located is near the small town of Elroy, Texas
(also known as Driskill, Dutch Waterhole, or Hume), a small community established in 1892 and
named by a local storeowner after his son Leroy (Smyrl 2011). In 1899, Elroy opened a post
office, and George L. Hume became its postmaster. The post office was closed in 1902, and
mail began to route through nearby Del Valle. A deed search conducted by Real Property
Services (see Appendix B) for Horizon indicates the property on which site 41TV2386 is located
was owned by J.L. Hume and G.L. Hume. Presumably, the latter is the same person who
served as Elroy’s first postmaster. Beginning in 1898, the Humes sold segments of the property
to David McAngus, the family of whom retained ownership in one form or another until it was
sold in 2010 to an entity of Accelerator Holdings, LLC.
Observed Specimens on Site 41TV2386
Debris associated with the razed farmstead seems to suggest the site was constructed
and occupied sometime in the early to mid 1900s. Very little remains of the farmstead structure
itself, but nails used in and around the farmstead are exclusively round wire nails (Figure 21). In
general, wire nails are used in buildings after 1900, when the first coils of steel round nails were
produced (GSNC 2002). The Bessemer process, which greatly reduced the cost of producing
soft steel during the 1880s, quickly replaced iron hand-wrought and cut nails (Visser 1996).
According to Visser (1996), by 1886, 10% of nails produced in the US were made of soft steel
wire. Within 6 years, more steel-wire nails were produced than iron-cut nails. By 1913, 90% of
nails produced in the US were wire nails.
Observed cultural materials on this site consisted predominantly of domestic refuse in
the form of small fragments of glass and historic ceramics. Other observed specimens include
a soda bottle, a stainless steel butter knife, a metal door strike-plate, ceramic insulators, a small
grinding wheel, and a brick fragment (Figures 22 to 25). Of the specimens observed, 9 are
useful in determining the temporal periods associated with the occupation. These are
selectively numbered throughout Figures 22 to 25 and listed accordingly in Table 3, where they
are described and given possible ranges in date. Overall, the cultural materials suggest an
occupation of the site as early as the 1850s based on the age range of the observed brick
specimen. However, 7 of the 9 diagnostic specimens suggest a likely age range between the
early 1900s to the present.
Summary of Site 41TV2386
Site 41TV2386 appears to be the remnants of a small farmstead that may have been
occupied as early as the 1850s based on the age range of the recovered brick specimen on the
site (see Table 3). However, given the isolated nature of the brick (on which that date is based),
it is more likely that the farmstead was constructed in the late 1890s or early 1900s, during the

time McAngus first began acquiring parcels of the property from the Humes. Indeed, 7 of the 9
diagnostic specimens collected during the investigation of site 41TV2386 bear out this
estimation. Collectively, the specimens signal a date of early occupation at the site starting
around 1913 and stretching into the mid to late 1900s. Although 3 diagnostic specimens (the
fire brick fragment, the manganese dioxide infused glass fragment, and round-headed wire
nails) have possible dates earlier than 1913, their end ranges still occur after that date.
The abandonment and razing of the farmstead is difficult to ascertain because none of
the property’s original owners could be contacted for interviews. However, aerial photographs
from the mid 1980s (COA 1984, 1987) and a topographic map from 1988 (USGS) show a visible
structure at the location of site 41TV2386. By the early 2000s the structure is no longer there
(CAPCOG 2002).
Based on the observed diagnostic specimens, the chain of title, and various topographic
maps and aerial photographs, it is Horizon’s estimation that the farmstead was constructed
during the early 1900s and occupied until the mid to late 1980s. An intensive search of the
McAngus and Hume surnames—those individuals who originally sold or occupied the
property—revealed no person, past or present, who had a prominent historical significance.
Similarly, no historically significant event associated with these surnames or the location of site
41TV2386 was found to exist. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2386 is ineligible
for inclusion on the NRHP under Criteria B and C. Additionally, based on the site’s overall lack
of integrity and the lack of stratified buried cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that site
41TV2386 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP under Criteria A and D. As such, Horizon
recommends no additional investigations on this site.
6.1.2

Site 41TV2387

General Site Description
Site 41TV2387 was documented as a small historic farmstead located approximately
322.0 m (1056.4 ft) north of site 41TV2386, on what would have been the same parcel of land
as the latter (Figures 26 and 27). Based on the extent of debris, its overall dimensions are
approximately 50.0 m (164.0 ft) north-south by 40.0 m (131.2 ft) east-west. The site is located
on a gently sloping ridge approximately 35.0 m (114.8 ft) east of a small, unnamed drainage. In
turn, this drainage flows north to Dry Creek, which is located approximately 0.9 km (0.57 miles)
northwest.
Observed Cultural Features on Site 41TV2387
The central feature of this farmstead consists of a collapsed house that has been
partially destroyed by relatively recent activity (Figures 28 to 30), so assessing the farmstead’s
original layout is difficult. The collapsed farmstead was built just inside and to the west of 2
wooden posts with attached barbed-wire (Figure 31). No associated specimens or features are
found east of this boundary. While the house seems to have been constructed with dimensional
lumber, corrugated metal, and other relatively modern building materials, the structure is
collapsed and lacks integrity. The only other visible feature is a pit (Figure 32) that is generally

round and measures approximately 2.0 m (6.5 ft) deep by 2.0 m in diameter (see Figure 32).
The pit is located 15.0 m (49.2 ft) north of the collapsed farmstead and appears to be an
abandoned well.
Site 41TV2387 is located on the same property as site 41TV2386. It is unclear when the
farmstead might have collapsed or abandoned as it could not be found on any topographic
maps of the area (PCL 1955, 1966, 1973, 1988, 2008). However, it can be seen on aerial
photographs as recently as the mid 1980s (COA 1984, 1987). Both sites are unidentifiable on
later aerial photographs (CAPCOG 2002), so they probably were abandoned at the same time.
Observed Specimens on Site 41TV2387
The farmstead is surrounded by scattered domestic debris consisting of a variety of
historic ceramic fragments, glass, metal fragments/nails, a ceramic insulator, and a beer bottle.
The observed specimens generally range in date from the early to mid 1900s. Only one
specimen (a Majolica ceramic plate fragment) has a date that may be earlier, between 18001900 (FMNH 2011). In general, the site contains an assortment of non-diagnostic fragments of
glass, porcelain ware, course earthenware, stoneware, and plain white glazed ware that
includes transfer ware and decal over glaze patterns (Figures 33 and 34). All evaluated
specimens lack general characteristics usually attributed to ceramics manufactured before 1900
(NATAMU 2010). Of the cultural specimens collected for evaluation, 9 are considered to be
diagnostic. These are selectively numbered throughout Figures 33 to 36 and listed accordingly
in Table 4, where they are described and given possible ranges of date.

Summary of Site 41TV2387
The age ranges of the recovered specimens from site 41TV2387 support the idea that it
and site 41TV2386 may have had interwoven purpose and similar use-lives. Five of the 9
diagnostic specimens from site 41TV2387 have production ranges that begin after 1913, which
is the date estimated for the early occupation of the farmstead on site 41TV2386. However, like
the diagnostic specimens from the other site, all but 1 of them on site 41TV2387 have ranges
still occurring after 1913. The Majolica ceramic plate fragment from 1800 to 1900 is also the
only fragment from either site (non-diagnostic and diagnostic) that has its origin in Mexico.
At the risk of oversimplifying the complexities inherent in concepts of agency and
identity, a plate such as this might have held special significance for its owner. Much like family
heirlooms that ground people in a sense of tradition and familial obligation, this one exceptional
specimen might have reminded the owner of home. The farmstead’s absence on topographic
maps and the very real possibility that employees of farms and ranches during the 1900s were
often Hispanic in origin may offer a plausible scenario for why this otherwise inconsistent
specimen fits well on site 41TV2387.
Based upon the same evidence provided for site 41TV2387 (i.e., observed diagnostic
specimens, chain of title, and various topographic maps and aerial photographs), it is Horizon’s
estimation that the farmstead was constructed during the early 1900s and occupied until the mid
to late 1980s. However, there exists very little future research potential for site 41TV2387, as
the farmstead is collapsed and cannot be properly assessed or evaluated, and its occupants
(probably employees of the property owners) are unknown through chain of title. Based on the
lack of association with a person of historical significance or a historically significant event
associated with the location, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2387 is ineligible for inclusion
on the NRHP under Criteria B and C. Additionally, based on the site’s overall lack of integrity
and the lack of stratified buried cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2387 is
ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP under Criteria A and D. As such, Horizon recommends no
additional investigations on this site.
6.1.3

Site 41TV2388

General Site Description
Site 41TV2388 was recorded as a moderately dense lithic scatter located on a hilltop in
the southern portion of the Project Area (Figures 37 through 39). Based on the extent of the
lithic surface materials, the site’s overall dimensions are approximately 30 m (98.4 ft) northsouth by 30 m east-west. The site is confined to a hilltop that slopes rather sharply into
unnamed drainages to the northeast and west. In turn, these drainages flow north to Dry Creek,
which is located approximately 0.8 miles (1.3 km) from the site. The hill is bounded to the
south, east, and west by a modern barbed wire fence, although the lithic specimens were not
found to extend to this fence line. As such, the site was delineated completely within the
boundaries of the Project Area rather than as a portion of a larger site that might extend beyond
the boundaries of the current Project Area.

Observed Cultural Features on Site 41TV2388
With the exception of a modern 2-track road and barbed wire fence, no cultural features
were observed on site 41TV2388.
Observed Specimens on Site 41TV2388
The observed cultural materials consist of chert specimens indicative of the various
stages of the lithic reduction sequence (Figure 40). Most of the specimens consisted of tertiary
flakes, although both primary and second flakes were present within the observed assemblage.
Additionally, 1 chert core and 1 bifacially flaked implement were observed on this site (Figure
41). However, no temporally diagnostic implements were observed on the site. Based on the
observed materials, this lithic scatter appears to represent a prehistoric lithic procurement site
that may have been used sporadically throughout prehistory. Except for 1 piece of lithic
debitage found in the only positive shovel test on the site, all observed artifacts were confined to
surface contexts. Because of the shallow clay deposits, there exists no potential for deeply
buried deposits.

Chapter 6.0: Results and Recommendations

Summary of Site 41TV2388
Site 41TV2388 was documented as a small lithic procurement site on a hilltop high
above Dry Creek. The entire surface of the site consists of rocky clays and marl deposits with
no potential for deeply buried deposits. While lithic procurement sites are often extensive in
nature, the limits of 41TV2388 were found to be contained well within the limits of the
boundaries of the current Project Area. As such, the site was delineated completely within the
boundaries of the Project Area rather than as a portion of a larger site that might extend beyond
the boundaries of the current Project Area. Based on the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts
observed on site 41TV2388 as well as the lack of potential for buried cultural deposits, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the further investigation of the site will not contribute positively towards
providing information that is pertinent to the prehistoric past. As such, it is Horizon’s opinion
that site 41TV2388 is ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP under Criterion D.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

The survey of the 479.33-acre Project Area resulted in the documentation of 2 historic
farmsteads (41TV2386 and 41TV2387) and 1 prehistoric lithic procurement area (site
41TV2388). Site 41TV2386 consists of a razed house with an associated fenced coral and
outbuilding foundation made of concrete. The farmstead is surrounded by scattered debris
ranging in date from the early to late 1900s. Site 41TV2387 consists of a collapsed farmstead
that has been partially destroyed by recent clearing activities. This farmstead is also
surrounded by scattered debris ranging in date from the early to late 1900s. Site 41TV2388 is a
prehistoric hilltop lithic procurement area consisting of numerous pieces of lithic debitage, 1
bifacial specimen, and 1 chert core. Based on the lack of integrity and the lack of potential for
buried, stratified cultural deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that all 3 sites do not qualify for
inclusion on the NRHP under Criteria A and D. Similarly, based on the lack of association of
sites 41TV2386 and 41TV2387 with a person or event of historical significance, it is Horizon’s
opinion that these 2 sites also do not qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under Criteria B and C.
As such, it is Horizon’s overall opinion that sites 41TV2386, 41TV2387, and 41TV2388 are all
ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP and that no further investigations are warranted at these
sites.
Based on the results of the intensive cultural resources survey, it is Horizon’s opinion
that the development of the Project Area will pose no adverse impacts to significant cultural
resources and that no further investigations are warranted. Therefore, Horizon recommends
that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking. However, in the unlikely event
that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during the development of the Project Area, even in previously surveyed
areas, all work at the location of the find should cease immediately and the THC should be
notified of the discovery. Additionally, if future development is initiated in the northeastern
portion of the property, beyond the limits of the current USACE jurisdiction for the development,
Horizon recommends that an intensive cultural resources survey be conducted before any
ground-disturbing activities begin.
