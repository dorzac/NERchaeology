Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint and access right-of-way of
the proposed TX 16612-B Telecaster Cellular Tower site in north-central Hartley County, Texas.
The Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR
Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No
Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent review of this archaeological report was provided
by the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeology Division. The total area to be impacted is
10,000 square feet (<0.23 acres), in addition to a 20-foot wide Access/Utility Easement, and three
40-foot Guy Wire Easements.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on January 3, 2015. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

funding was involved in the proposed development of the property, the Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking.
In December 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or
within one mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural
resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area.
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area.

Project Environment
The Project Area lies within the north-central portion of Hartley County, some ten miles
southwest of Dalhart in the Texas Panhandle, within the Great Plains region, in the High Plains
area. The topography of Hartley county is typified by smooth tableland, High Plains broken by
playa basins shallow drainages, and most prominently Punta de Agua Creek and Rita Blanca
Canyon. Both of these intermittent drainages ultimatley empty into the Canadian River to the
south in Oldham County. Otherwise, Rolling Plains dominate the southern portion of the county.
Elevation in Hartley County ranges from about 3,200 feet in the southeast, to roughly 4,200 feet
in the northwestern portion (Abbe 1996; Fox 1977).
The modern climate of the Project Area is classified as semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall
of about 18 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout the year, with average
daily maximum temperatures averaging about 92 degrees in July, to around 20 degrees in January.
The combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in frequent droughts as well
as periods of abundant moisture, resulting in a growing season of roughly 180 days (Abbe 1996;
Fox 1977).
Soils
The soils in the northern portion of Hartley County formed from Rocky Mountain outwash and
an overlying loess mantle, while soils in the southern portion were formed from High Plains
Ogallala formation alluvium and exposed Triassic red beds (Fox 1977).
As shown in Figure 4, the TX 16612-B Telecaster Tower and its three Guys will impact Dallam
fine sandy loam (DfB). Dallam fine sandy loam is commonly found on smooth uplands in this area
of Hartley County. A typical soil pedon of Dallam fine sandy loam consists of friable brown fine
sandy loam to about 6 inches below the surface, underlain by brown sandy clay loam from about
6 to 30 inches. The subsoil is typically yellowish red sandy clay loam from 30 to 65 inches. Below
that, the soil is acidic, pink sandy clay loam to about 80 inches (Fox 1977; WebSoil Survey Online
2014).

Cultural Chronology
The location of the TX 16612-B Telecaster Cellular tower survey area presumes cultural affinities
and influences from the Southern Great Plains (Figure 5). Several scholars have offered sound
but differing arguments for cultural chronologies for the Southern Great Plains extending into
northern Texas. The cultural chronology, defined by complex (in lieu of the terms phase, interval,
or period) of the North American High Plains has been synthesized by Hofman et al. (1989), and
more recently, the Southern High Plains in Texas by Johnson and Holliday (1995) and Boyd
(1995). It should be noted that the Southern Great Plains complexes are defined by shifts in
climatic conditions and subsistence more so than changes in point style, which are indicators of
change in central and south Texas. The following discussions are primarily derived from Johnson
and Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989). All dates are approximate
and given as years before present (B.P.).

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may
have inhabited the
landscape before 11,500
B.P, solid evidence does
not support their
existence. Although
human behavior is
inferred on stone
artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site
(Fox et al. 1992:51-73),
all are problematic. At
Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of
north-central Texas,
r a d i o carbon d a t e s
initially believed to be
from burned charcoal in
human campfires, and
approximating an
antiquity of 40,000 years
were later disproved as
dates on natural coal Figure 5. Map of Texas Archaeological Regions (adapted from
( S t a n f o r d Black 1989a).
1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic
proof of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on
stable landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and
with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances
of providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains
were occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between approximately
11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980) suggests
an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts include
Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people
who made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have documented
the presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture include
5

bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called "Goshen" may be present (Hofman 1989:34; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973).
By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in
Bell County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940),
archaeological evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either
extinct or otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer,
antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman
1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano
Estacado from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of
megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic
hunter-gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game
hunting was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas,
such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock cooking features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were
small and highly mobile, an inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed
and that diagnostic types are seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern
Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the
inhabitants to broaden their diets to pursue plants and animals which would produce the same
amount of calories and protein with the same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile
points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi) argues that the area was used more frequently in the
6

Early Archaic than in the Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to “decline of bison and other
game animals on the Southern Plains.” Story (1985), however, believes that population densities
were low during this period, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
"few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on diffuse
utilization of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and
lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285).
Hurt (1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains
decreased, and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation
of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut
harvests in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black
1989a). Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely
scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the
acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and
processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens
are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt
this conclusion (e.g., Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock
middens are still a matter of controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach
and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus
seems to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other
plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds
of accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological
community, but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
7

Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about
4500 B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites,
at least in the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as
the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or
fell during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of
burned rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the
Blue Hole site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32
(Black et al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens
at Camp Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County
(Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in
diameter were still very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have
become less specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base
(Black 1989b:30). Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains
area, and we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the
Late Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story
(1985:44-45) believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981),
Hitzfelder Cave (Givens 1968a, b), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic
populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt
(1980) further posits that population in the Hartley County area peaked during the Late Archaic
with groups moving into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found
in the region were more closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points. The most common are
Ensor and Frio types, both of which are short, triangular points with side notches. The Frio point
also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt
(1980) presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's
(1974) contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes,
which also lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.

Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits mark the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including
the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and
the northern South Texas Plain (Black 1989b:32; Story 1985:45-47). Two complexes following
the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from about
2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts
into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977;
Skinner 1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).
Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into
the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to
Hurt (1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is
mirrored in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due
to the increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the “Protohistoric”. On the Southern High Plains, Hofman (1989:91)
agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were limited
European contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history.” The
cultural context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence
of outside ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos
and Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed
in many sources (e.g., Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975;
Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan
Apache, and Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989;
Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on
the Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache
adapted to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the
Spaniards (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another
group of nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas
(Campbell 1991:111).

9

A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among
them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages
have been lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994;
Johnson and Campbell 1992).
Hartley County History
“Until the frontier reached the Hartley County region in the 1870s, the area was just a small part
of the huge, vacant High Plains, which stretch from Texas to Canada. An Apachean culture
occupied the Panhandle-Plains area in prehistoric times; the modern Apaches emerged then but
were pushed out of the region about 1700 by the Comanches, who ruled the area until they were
defeated in the Red River War of 1873–74 and subsequently removed to Indian Territory. In 1876
the Texas legislature marked off Hartley County from land formerly assigned to Bexar and Young
counties. Due to its proximity to both the Canadian River and New Mexico, Hartley County
undoubtedly witnessed the comings and goings of Comancheros, ciboleros, and pastores as they
ventured eastward from New Mexico into Comanchería on the Great Plains. The pastores, in fact,
continued to migrate yearly after the Indian era and made up a large part of the regional
population and economy into the early 1880s” (Abbe 1996).
“With the Indians removed, cowmen entered the region, and in the late 1870s and 1880s Hartley
County changed from raw frontier into the domain of the established rancher. The county quickly
became a part of the huge ranching industry that developed in Northwest Texas after the Civil
War. Between 1876 and the 1890s many well-known Panhandle ranches blossomed on Hartley
County soil” (Abbe 1996).
“In 1880 the county had only 100 residents; by 1890, 252 people lived in the area. In 1891 the
county was organized with the tiny town of Hartley as county seat. By 1900 cattle ranching in
the county had expanded considerably, though the number of ranches had declined. Railroads first
entered Hartley County in 1888, when the Fort Worth and Denver Railway extended its main line
westward from Amarillo through the sites of Channing, Hartley, and Dalhart, to Texline, in
Dallam County. The Chicago, Rock Island and Mexico Railway, building southwesterly from
Enid, Oklahoma, to Tucumcari, New Mexico, entered the county through Dalhart in 1901. Thus,
with two rail connections to the outside world, Hartley County ranches shipped their cattle more
easily than before, and settlers began to arrive in larger numbers. Between 1900 and 1930 the
number of farms and ranches in Hartley County grew significantly, and farming began to play a
larger role in the local economy” (Abbe 1996).
“During the first half of the twentieth century, a road system was built in the area. By 1927 much
of what later became U.S. Highway 87, running from Amarillo to Dalhart, had been built across
the northeastern corner of the county, but it remained unpaved until the end of the 1930s. The
grim days of the Dust Bowl and Great Depression set the area back during the 1930s. More than
20 per cent of local farmers were compelled to give up their lands, and by 1940 only 207 farms
remained in the county. The establishment of Dalhart Army Air Field in northern Hartley County
during World War II helped to revive the economy, however, and crop production also picked
10

up as farmers increasingly tapped the huge Ogallala Aquifer for water; during this time Hartley
County developed an economy based on both ranching and wheat, corn, and sorghum culture.
Irrigation of farmland steadily increased during the postwar years, and by 1980 more than
100,000 acres of local cropland was irrigated. Natural gas production totaled nearly 6.6 billion
cubic feet in 1982. In 2000 more than 2.6 billion cubic feet of gas and about 392,000 barrels of
oil were produced in Hartley County; by the end of that year 6,183,825 barrels of oil had been
taken from the area since 1937. In 2000, incorporated communities in the county include
Channing, the county seat, and Dalhart” (Abbe 1996).

Archaeological Atlas Site Results

A review of the Texas Atlas indicated that the TX 16612-B Telecaster Cellular Tower site had
not been subjected to a cultural resources survey, nor were there any documented archaeological
surveys, no known archaeological sites, historic structures, nor historical markers within one mile.
(Atlas 2014).
As of December 18, 2014 there were 49 documented archaeological sites in Hartley County, and
together they begin to convey a glimpse of how the landscape may have been exploited over the
past several millennia in the area. It is evident that humans have lived in the area from the
Paleoindian period, perhaps as long as 11,500 years ago. Of the 49 sites, 17 are prehistoric open
campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian through the early Historic periods. Perhaps one of
the most significant and notable campsites is 41HT60, where 153 metal artifacts, including
cartridges, gun cleaning brushes, buttons, metal arrow points, horse and mule shoes, coscojos,
a broken Spanish bit, metal tent pegs, a pocket knife, metal belt buckles, an Alibates scraper, and
a cord marked pottery sherd were among the hundreds of artifacts found. The site is situated
along the Fort Bascom Wagon Road, used by Indians, Mexicans, Comancheros, military, and
freighters in the 1800s.
Fourteen of the 49 documented sites have been classified as prehistoric lithic scatters, and one as
a prehistoric lithic procurement site. Numerous early historic sites in the county include a 1930s
stone corral, an 1880s sheep pen with windmill, an 1870s early Anglo cattle ranch with a
sandstone block ranch house and two half-dugouts, a late 1800s Hispanic ranch house and stone
cattle pens, an early 1900s cemetery with four burials, an early 1800s homestead, and multiple
1800s and 1900s trash scatters. Two other unique sites are, one in which bison bones are eroding
from a cutbank, and the other where fossilized elephant, horse, and camel bones were found in
association with Alibates chert, Tecovas chert, and Dakota quartzite artifacts. The only State
Archeological landmark (SAL) in Hartley County is the Hartley County Courthouse and Jail in
Channing (Atlas 2014).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was structured
around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
Prior to the
archaeological
survey, the area
to be impacted
had been clearly
delineated with
survey stakes
(see
for
example, Figure
6 ) . I n
Accordance
with Texas
Historical
Commission
(THC) and
Council of
T e x a s
Archeologists
( C T A )
A r c h a e o l o g y Figure 6. Photo of tower footprint from site centroid and ST 5 toward
S u r v e y Utility/Access right-of-way to Hwy 54; facing NW.
S tandards, a
systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the delineated tract was conducted. Soils matrices
from the six shovel tests (STs) were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. In accordance with
a designed research plan, all redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be
collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test. Excavation of
the shovel tests were terminated at 60 centimeters below the surface (cmbs).

Results of the Investigations
S u r f a c e
E x a mi n at i o n
and Shovel
Testing
The tower
footprint area
a n d
g u y
locations had
obviously been
heavily disturbed
due to plowing
and discing. As
shown in Figures
6 and 7, surface
visibility ranged
between 50-60
percent across
the site, and the
entryway from
Hwy 54 crosses Figure 7. Tower site. Shovel is in site centroid; facing SW.
a bladed bar ditch and barb wire fence.
A total of six shovel tests were placed within the tower’s footprint, access/utility easement from
Hwy 54, and the three guy locations (Figure 8). The results of all six shovel tests were generally
the same. The upper 8-10 cm was frozen and compact, exhibiting light brown sand, underlain by
light brown sandy clay loam to about 50 cmbs, then pale brown sandy clay loam with yellowish
red sandy clay mottling and faint calcium carbonate stains. The Project Area lies within a hay
pasture, and in all cases, an apparent shallow plow zone was detected to roughly 15 centimeters
below the surface (cmbs). Otherwise, grass roots were common within that same upper zone.
Notably, no gravels were observed either on or below the surface.
The results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms, are on file at Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, and are available upon request. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface or in either of the six shovel tests.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
There are no known archaeological sites, historic structures, nor historic markers within the visual
APE of the proposed TX 16612-B Telecaster Cell Tower site. A thorough pedestrian survey of
the surface within the Project Area was conducted, and six shovel tests were excavated. No
evidence of neither prehistoric nor historic occupation was found either on or below the surface.
Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered as
eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction
within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.
