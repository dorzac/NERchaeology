ABSTRACT
On behalf of DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive archaeological survey of portions of the 198-mile-long Sand Hills Phase
IIIC Pipeline Project in Frio, Zavala, Maverick, Kinney, Edwards and Sutton counties, Texas.
The proposed project will consist of the construction of approximately 198 miles (115.8 km) of
20-inch diameter pipeline for transporting petroleum liquids. The pipeline will be installed, with
the exception of horizontal directional drills (HDD) and bores, at a maximum depth of 5–6 feet
below surface within a corridor measuring approximately 198 miles in length and 90 feet in
average width. Much of the alignment, 105 miles, is collocated with one or more existing linear
utilities or roadways. Investigations were performed pursuant to regulatory obligations related to
the acquisition of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Clean Water Act, Section 404
permit in accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army
Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current
Interim Guidance Document dated April 25, 2005) and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (16 USC 470) (NHPA) and it’s implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).
SWCA’s investigations included a background literature and records review and an intensive
pedestrian survey with shovel testing and backhoe trenching to systematically identify, record,
delineate, and, if possible, determine the significance of any cultural resources located within the
project area.
The background literature review revealed that three linear and three area archaeological
investigations have been conducted within a 1-mile (1.6 km) radius of the project area and 74
previously recorded archeological sites, one historic marker and one cemetery are located within
a mile of the project area. Of these, three linear and two area surveys directly intersect the
proposed centerline and eight archaeological sites, 41ED14, 41KY160, 41MV99, 41ZV96,
41ZV181, 41ZV443, 41ZV455 and 41ZV459, are within 100 m of the proposed centerline.
Prior to the field investigation, SWCA developed and submitted a scope of work to the USACE
and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) for review and approval. The resulting approved
scope of work limited investigations to include areas adjacent to natural, relatively intact,
anticipated USACE jurisdictional waterways crossed by the alignment. As such, SWCA
proceeded to investigate terraces and floodplains adjacent to prominent waterways some of
which include the Nueces, Leona and Frio rivers and Perdido, Elm, Pinto, Las Moras,
Chaparrosa, Todos Santos and Palo Blanco creeks.
Within the Phase IIIC survey area, 132 High Probability Areas (HPAs) were delineated,
encompassing approximately 79.2 miles (127.5 km), or 960 acres in total area. The survey was
conducted within a typical 100-foot-wide survey corridor and included the excavation of 27
backhoe trenches and 1,483 shovel tests, which is roughly 18.7 shovel tests per mile or one every
86 m. These excavation intervals exceed those typically recommended by the THC, which are 16
shovel tests per mile or one every 100 m.
Overall, investigations in the proposed project corridor encountered a mix of undisturbed and
disturbed areas resulting from modifications from an assortment of land use practices. The
SWCA investigations documented 44 new prehistoric sites (41ED265–41ED271, 41FR70–

41FR72, 41FR90–41FR96, 41KY158, 41KY159, 41KY172–175, 41MV367–41MV371,
41ZV461–41ZV463, 41ZV485–41ZV497), seven previously recorded sites (41ED14, 41KY160,
41ZV96, 41ZV181, 41ZV443, 41ZV455 and 41ZV459), and an assortment of isolated
prehistoric artifacts. Due to a variety of factors, including a lack of unique characteristics or
contextual integrity, 45 of these resources (41ED14, 41ED265–41ED271, 41FR71, 41FR72,
41FR90–41FR93, 41FR95, 41FR96, 41KY159, 41KY160, 41KY172–175, 41MV367–
41MV371, 41ZV181, 41ZV443, 41ZV455, 41ZV461–41ZV463, and 41ZV486–41ZV497) are
not recommended as eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
However, four archaeological sites (41FR70, 41FR94, 41KY158, and 41ZV485) are
recommended as potentially significant and warrant avoidance or further investigation. DCP has
elected to avoid these potentially significant resources through HDD (i.e., boring) measures.
Archaeological significance testing at 41FR70 found portions of the site to be eligible for listing
on the NRHP under Criterion D (Lawrence et al. 2012). These significant portions on 41FR70
will be avoided via HDD.
In accordance with Section 106, 36 CFR 800.4 of the NHPA, SWCA has made a reasonable and
good faith effort to identify archaeological and historic properties within the investigated project
area. Based on the survey findings and DCP’s avoidance measures, no significant or potentially
significant cultural resources will be adversely affected by the proposed project. Consequently,
SWCA recommends no further archaeological investigations within the investigated portions of
the project area and that the project be allowed to proceed.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP),
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive archaeological
survey of portions of the 198-mile-long
Sand Hills Phase IIIC Pipeline Project in
Frio, Zavala, Maverick, Kinney, Edwards
and Sutton counties, Texas (Figure 1). The
work, which included an archaeological
background literature and records review
and an intensive pedestrian survey with
shovel testing and backhoe trenching to
systematically identify, record, delineate,
and, if possible, determine the significance
of any cultural resources located within the
project area, was conducted in support of
DCP’s application requirements for a
USACE Clean Water Act, Section 404
permit in accordance with 33 CFR Part 325,
Appendix C (Processing Department of
Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection
of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with
current Interim Guidance Document dated
April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007) and
Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (16 USC 470) (NHPA) and
it’s implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).

The proposed pipeline, with the exception of
horizontal directional drills and bores at
major stream and river crossings and
designated roadways and cultural resources,
will be installed at a maximum depth of 5–6
feet below surface within a corridor
measuring approximately 198 miles in
length and 90 feet in average width,
encompassing a total area of approximately
2,160 acres. Anticipated ground disturbance
within the proposed 90-foot-wide ROW will
include clearing vegetation, excavating a
trench, laying the pipe, replacing the soil,
adjusting the topography to match preconstruction contours, and re-establishing
vegetation. After construction, a permanent
50-foot-wide easement in most places will
be maintained and mowed on a regular
basis.
Most of the proposed IIIC alignment (105
miles) is collocated with one or more
existing utilities or roadways. Specifically,
53 miles of the alignment parallels existing
roadways (in northern Kinney and southern
Edwards counties), about 43 miles are
collocated with one or more existing
pipeline easements (in southern Sutton,
northern Edwards, eastern Zavala, and
western Frio counties), and nine miles
follow existing electrical lines (in eastern
Zavala and western Frio counties).

All investigations were conducted in
accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) standards, with any
exceptions thoroughly documented from
September 2011 through May 2012.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND
DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
DCP proposes to construct approximately
198 miles of 20-inch diameter pipeline for
transporting
petroleum
liquids.
The
proposed
project
will
originate
approximately 0.9 miles southeast of Derby,
Texas connecting with a DCP pipeline in
Frio County. The proposed project will
extend approximately 198 miles northeast

Associated with the IIIC project are aboveground facilities consisting of mainline
block valve stations (n=13), a pipeline
inspection gauge (PIG) launching/receiving
station, and pump stations (n=2). All of
these facilities are located in upland settings
adjacent to the IIIC corridor.

and Johnston 1979).

The valve and PIG stations are to be
constructed within areas covering about 0.02
acres (1,000 square feet) while the pump
stations are to be constructed in areas
covering approximately 5 acres.

The southern half of the proposed IIIC
alignment crosses the Interior Coastal Plains
with an elevation ranging between 300–800
feet above mean sea level (amsl). This
region is characterized as having parallel
ridges and valleys centered upon permanent
waterways comprised of alternating belts of
uncemented sands and shale of differing
resistance. The vegetation of the Interior
Coastal Plains contain hardwood and pine
timber, which decline in prevalence as the
region extends west and south (Wermund
2012). Near the center of the IIIC route, the
alignment crosses the narrow region
containing the Blackland Prairies aligning
the
Balcones
Escarpment.
This
physiographic region is described as having
a gradually undulating surface of clay soils
overlying chalks and marls. The Blackland
Prairies range in elevation between 450–
1,000 feet amsl (Wermund 2012). The
northern half of the proposed IIIC pipeline is
situated within the Edwards Plateau. This
physiographic region is characterized as
having a level upper surface of Cretaceous
limestone and dolomite with various
drainages eroding the uplands eventually
forming box canyons. The Edwards Plateau
ranges in elevation between 450–3,000 feet
amsl (Wermund 2012).

For the purposes of the archaeological
survey, a targeted survey of High
Probability Areas (HPAs) was selected in
favor of a 100 percent survey of the entire
route. This was based on the examination of
numerous variables in a Geographic
Information System (GIS) database (e.g.,
previously recorded sites, disturbances, and
soils). Put simply, the HPAs were defined as
locales that possess or have an elevated
likelihood of containing cultural resources,
particularly significant ones. Overall, the
GIS-based probability modeling used in the
HPA development serves to streamline and
focus
survey
efforts
in
USACE
jurisdictional areas with the highest potential
for intact cultural resources. The GIS
probability modeling delineated 132 HPAs
within the Phase IIIC survey area. The
HPAs encompassed approximately 79.2
miles (127.5 km) within the 100-foot-wide
ROW, or 960 acres in total area.

ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION
The proposed Sand Hills IIIC alignment
covers a six county area in south central
Texas. The project encompasses a diverse
environmental setting and a variety of
landforms. The project area begins in the
Gulf Coastal Plains physiographic region,
crosses the Blackland Prairies aligning the
base of the Balcones Escarpment, and ends
in the Edwards Plateau physiographic region
of Texas (Wermund 2012). A physiographic
province is briefly characterized as a region
with a shared geology (rocks and soil),
vegetation, fauna, and climate (Wermund

thick layers of limestone were slowly
constructed (Spearing 1991:9–10, 17). The
Cretaceous Period is composed of two
subdivisions designated the Lower and
Upper Cretaceous periods. The lower
formations are older and primarily occur
along the eastern margins of the plateau. The
upper formations are younger and more
prevalent and are found across more than
half the state. The rocks of the Cretaceous
formation consist of sandstone, marl, and
limestone with the limestone becoming
more indurated and fractured as it grades
upward. The southern and eastern edges of
the Edwards Plateau are indicated by the
Balcones escarpment formed by a fault zone
(Spearing
1991;
Swanson
1995).
Considering for the length of the Sand Hills
IIIC alignment a variety of geological
formations of varying age are encountered.

The surface geology of the IIIC alignment is
discussed from the southern end toward the
northern end.
The nearly level Gulf Coastal Plains
composing the southern half of the IIIC
alignment are generally described as
progressively younger beds of sediment
arranged en echelon toward the Gulf of
Mexico. These Tertiary and Quaternary beds
were deposited subsequent to the Cenozoic
period during the recession of the Gulf of
Mexico (Swanson 1995). In general, the
Tertiary and Quaternary deposits are
composed of sandstone, siltstone, and
mudstone, while drainages on the Coastal
Plain largely contain Holocene-age deposits
of clay, silt, sand, and gravel.
In order of predominance along the Gulf
Coastal Plains, the surface geology consists
of Eocene-aged Laredo Formation, El Pico
Clay, Bigford Formation, Pleistocene-age
Fluviatile terrace deposits, Eocene-aged
Carrizo Sand, Pliocene-Pleistocene-aged
Uvalde Gravels, and recent (Holocene)
alluvium (Barnes 1976; Fisher 1977). The
Laredo Formation is described as containing
sandstone and clay, the El Pico Clay
deposits consist of clay, sandstone, and coal,
the Bigford Formation contains clay,
sandstone, and lignite, while the Carrizo
Sand contains sandstone and shale. The
Uvalde Gravels are characterized as calichecemented gravel, pebbles, and cobbles of
chert, quartz and igneous rock.

The Upper Cretaceous aged deposits are
positioned at the southern edge of the
Edwards Plateau and include shale, siltstone,
and limestone of the Eagle Ford Member,
limestone of the Buda Formation, and clay
of the Del Rio Formation (Barnes 1976;
Fisher 1977, 1981). The Lower Cretaceous
formations are primarily mapped at the
northern half of the IIIC alignment and
include the limestone and dolomite of the
Segovia, Salmon Peak, and Devils River
Members (Barnes 1976; Fisher 1977, 1981).
Less common, but more relevant to
prehistoric settlement and the integrity of
archaeological sites are the Pleistocene and
Holocene deposits. These deposits are
mapped along drainage valleys and
waterways crossed by entire the Sand Hills
IIIC
alignment.
These
consist
of
Pleistocene-aged fluviatile terrace deposits,

deposits,
and
Holocene-aged alluvium (Barnes 1976;

The Edwards Plateau composing the
northern half of the Sand Hills IIIC
alignment has a Cretaceous Period
beginning that occurred roughly 144–66
million years ago (Finsley 1996; Hentz
2009; Roberts 1996; Spearing 1991;

and clay with common pebbles and cobbles
of chert, quartzite, igneous rock, and
metamorphic rock (Barnes 1976; Fisher
1977, 1981). The undivided Quaternary
deposits are characterized as mixed deposits
derived from local alluvial fans, colluvium,
caliche, and alluvium (Barnes 1976; Fisher
1977, 1981). Finally, the Holocene alluvium
is described as occupying floodplains and
low terraces composed of local gravel, sand,
silt, clay, and organic matter.

FLORA
Broadly defined, the project area is situated
at the northern edge of the South Texas
Plains region that is described as level to
rolling prairies and a growth of mesquite
and various cacti. Additionally, the project
area lies along the margins of two
intermingled floral communities of the
Edwards Plateau region to the north and the
Blackland Prairies region to the south
(Correll and Johnston 1979:3–10). The
Edwards Plateau region is described as
rough, rocky areas with a tall to mid-grass
understory and a mixed overstory of oaks,
juniper, and mesquite that blends into other
vegetative regions along its boundaries. In
contrast, the Blackland Prairies region is
composed of grasses with scattered timber
particularly along drainages.

SOILS
Soil survey data for the proposed Sand Hills
alignment in Frio, Zavala, Maverick,
Kinney, Edwards, and Sutton counties were
derived from the Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS 2012) and
from published soil surveys (Gabriel et al.
1992, 2009; Newman et al. 1992; Stevens
and Arriaga 1977, 1985; Wieden and
McAndrew 1968). The discussion below
broadly reviews the soil associations from
south to north in order of predominance
mapped for the proposed alignment (Table
1).
For the southern half of the proposed
alignment within Frio, Zavala, and Maverick
counties have mapped soils generally
characterized as nearly level to undulating
deposits of loams, sandy loam, clay loams,
and clays occupying uplands (Table 1). The
exception includes soils of the Brundage and
Cochina-Winterhaven Associations. These
deposits are described as loamy-clay loam
soils occupying valleys and lowlands.
For the northern half of the proposed
alignment within Kinney, Edwards, and
Sutton counties have mapped soils generally
characterized as more stony and gravelly
deposits of loams and clays occupying
upland side slopes, valley divides, and hills
(Table 1). Soils of the Knippa-Frio and

Bird species composition in the project area
is fairly diverse with numerous breeding,
migrant, and wintering species present
(Kutac and Caran 1994). Typical birds
within the project area include black
vultures (Coragyps atratus), turkey vultures
(Cathartes aura), northern bobwhite

(Zanaida macroura), northern mockingbird
(Mimus polyglottos), red tailed hawk (Buteo

In addition to mammals and birds, Blair

amphibians and reptiles within the biotic
provinces. Some reptiles common to the

plant foods (Bousman et al. 2002; Bousman
et al. 2004; Bever and Meltzer 2007; Dering
2007; Meltzer and Bever 1995). Faunal
remains from Kincaid Rockshelter and the
Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) support
this view (Collins 1998; Collins et al. 1989).
Longstanding ideas about Paleoindian
technologies also are being challenged.

CULTURAL HISTORY

Surficial and deeply buried sites, rockshelter
sites, and isolated artifacts represent
Paleoindian occupations in the central Texas
region. Although Paleoindian site types are
not well documented in the region, they can
be generally classified according to broad
site type categories extrapolated from
nearby regions. Both open and protected
(rockshelter) types are known. Usually these
sites are near permanent sources of water
such as tributary creeks or springs. Bison
kill sites, open and protected campsites, and
non-occupation lithic sites are known from
the Paleoindian period in Texas. Intra-site
features include hearths and isolated burials.
The Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235),
41BX52, and 41BX229 contain stratified
Paleoindian deposits (Hester 1980b). The
lower component at the Wilson-Leonard site
contained a Paleoindian burial (Collins et al.
1998).

The following prehistoric cultural history
derives its information from several central
Texas regional chronologies: Black (1989),
Collins (1995, 2004), Hester (1980a, 1995,
2004), Johnson and Goode (1994), which
build upon the seminal efforts of Suhm
(1960) and Prewitt (1981, 1985).
Furthermore,
as
mentioned
above,
significant archaeological sites within the
Central Texas archaeological region and the
Edwards Plateau have contributed important
information to understanding prehistory.
The following prehistoric cultural sequence
is divided into three periods: Paleoindian,
Archaic, and Late Prehistoric. The Archaic
period is subdivided into four subperiods:
Early, Middle, Late, and Transitional. The
Historic period follows the Late Prehistoric,
announcing the arrival of Europeans to
central Texas.

Collins (2004) divides the Paleoindian
period into early and late subperiods. Two
projectile point styles, Clovis and Folsom,
are included in the early subperiod. Clovis
chipped
stone
artifact
assemblages,
including the diagnostic fluted lanceolate
Clovis point, were produced by bifacial,
flake, and prismatic-blade techniques on
high-quality and oftentimes exotic lithic
materials (Collins 1990). Along with
chipped stone artifacts, Clovis assemblages
include engraved stones, bone and ivory
points, stone bolas, and ochre (Collins
1995:381; Collins et al. 1992). Clovis points
are found evenly distributed along the

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Human occupation of the Central Texas
archaeological region is thought to have
begun approximately 11,000 years ago. This
period correlates with the end of the late
Pleistocene, the last ice age in North
America. These early Texans are
characterized by small but highly mobile
bands of foragers who were specialized
hunters of Pleistocene megafauna; however,
Paleoindians probably used a much wider
array of resources including small fauna and

17

analysis of a large sample of unfluted
lanceolate points by Kerr and Dial (1998)
have shed some light on this issue. At
Wilson-Leonard, the Paleoindian projectile
point sequence includes an expanding-stem
dart point termed Wilson, which dates to ca.
10,000–9,500 B.P. Postdating the Wilson
component is a series of unfluted lanceolate
points referred to as Golondrina-Barber, St.
Mary’s Hall, and Angostura, but their
chronological
sequence
is
poorly
understood. Nonetheless, it has become
clear that the artifact and feature
assemblages of the later Paleoindian
subperiod appear to be Archaic-like in
nature and in many ways may represent a
transition between the early Paleoindian and
succeeding Archaic periods (Collins
2004:118).

eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau, where
the presence of springs and outcrops of
chert-bearing limestone are common
(Meltzer and Bever 1995:58). Sites within
the area yielding Clovis points and Clovisage materials include Kincaid Rockshelter
(Collins et al. 1989) and San Macros Springs
(Takac 1991). Analyses of Clovis artifacts
and site types suggest that Clovis peoples
were well-adapted, generalized huntergatherers with the technology to hunt larger
game but not solely rely on it.
In contrast, Folsom tool kits—consisting of
fluted Folsom points, thin unfluted
(Midland) points, large thin bifaces, and end
scrapers—are more indicative of specialized
hunting, particularly of bison (Collins
2004:117). Folsom point distributions, both
their frequency and spatial patterning, differ
from the Clovis patterns, suggesting a shift
in adaptation patterns (Bever and Meltzer
2007; Meltzer and Bever 1995:60 and 74).
Folsom points appear more frequently in the
coastal plain as well as the South Texas
plain, which encompasses the southern half
of the IIIC alignment. As Folsom points are
almost exclusively found in plains settings
(they are conspicuously lacking in the
Edwards Plateau), the technology perhaps
marks a more specialized adaptation, likely
to a more intensive reliance on Bison
antiquus.

ARCHAIC PERIOD
The Archaic period for the Central Texas
archaeological region dates from ca. 8,800
to 1,300–1,200 B.P. (Collins 2004) and
generally is believed to represent a shift
toward hunting and gathering of a wider
array of animal and plant resources and a
decrease in group mobility (Willey and
Phillips 1958:107–108). In the eastern and
southwestern United States and on the Great
Plains, development of horticultural-based,
semi-sedentary to sedentary societies
succeeded the Archaic period. In these areas,
the Archaic truly represents a developmental
stage of adaptation as Willey and Phillips
(1958) define it. For central Texas, this
notion of the Archaic is somewhat
problematic. An increasing amount of
evidence
suggests
that
Archaic-like
adaptations were in place before the Archaic
(Bousman et al. 2002; Collins 2004:117–
118, 1998; Collins et al. 1989) and that these
practices continued into the succeeding Late
Prehistoric period (Collins 2004:118–119;
Prewitt 1981:74). In a real sense, the

Postdating Clovis and Folsom points in the
archaeological record are a series of dart
point styles (primarily unfluted lanceolate
darts) for which the temporal, technological,
or cultural significance is unclear. Often, the
Plainview type name is assigned these dart
points, but Collins (2004:117) has noted that
many of these points typed as Plainview do
not resemble Plainview type-site points in
thinness and flaking technology. Recent
investigations at the Wilson-Leonard site
(see Bousman 1998) and a statistical

18

are present in the archaeological record. A
variety of expediency tools, often nothing
more than utilized flakes, are increasingly
present in the Early Archaic (Black 1989).

Archaic period of central Texas is not a
developmental stage, but an arbitrary
chronological construct and projectile point
style sequence. Establishment of this
sequence is based on several decades of
archaeological investigations at stratified
Archaic sites along the eastern and southern
margins of the Edwards Plateau. Collins
(2004) and Johnson and Goode (1994) have
divided this sequence into three parts—
early, middle, and late—based on perceived
(though not fully agreed upon by all
scholars) technological, environmental, and
adaptive changes. However, Turner and
Hester (1999) and Black (1989) have
designated another period at the end of the
Archaic, referred to as Transitional Archaic
or Terminal Archaic.

The construction and use of rock hearths and
ovens, which had been limited during the
Paleoindian period, become commonplace
in the Early Archaic. The use of rock
features suggests that retaining heat and
releasing it slowly over an extended period
were important in food processing and
cooking and reflects a specialized
subsistence strategy. Such a practice
probably was related to cooking plant foods,
particularly roots and bulbs, many of which
must be subjected to prolonged periods of
cooking to render them consumable and
digestible (Black et al. 1997:257;
Wandsnider 1997; Wilson 1930). Botanical
remains, as well as other organic materials,
are often poorly preserved in Early Archaic
sites, so the range of plant foods exploited
and their level of importance in the overall
subsistence strategy are poorly understood.
But recovery of charred wild hyacinth
(Camassia scilloides) bulbs from an Early
Archaic feature at the Wilson-Leonard site
provides some insights into the types of
plant foods used and their importance in the
Early Archaic diet (Collins 1998). At the
Gatlin Site (41KR621) in Kerr County, the
researchers interpreted two types of cooking
based upon the encountered burned rock
features (Houk et al. 2008). The first type is
small-scale grilling/smoking of fauna and
flora resources while the second type
attributed to the earth ovens was large scale
baking of flora and possibly fauna (Houk et
al.
2008:13-17–13-18).
The
Gatlin
researchers examined similar features from
other Early Archaic sites in the region and
noted that there is a wide variety concerning
the occurrence of small and large burned
rock features. Some Early Archaic sites
solely contained large earth ovens while

EARLY ARCHAIC
The Early Archaic period (8,800–6,000 B.P.)
is better documented than the Paleoindian
period, however a complete understanding
of cultural patterns does not yet exist. Early
Archaic sites are small, and their tool
assemblages are diverse (Weir 1976:115–
122), suggesting that populations were
highly mobile and densities low (Prewitt
1985:217). It has been noted that Early
Archaic sites are concentrated along the
eastern and southern margins of the Edwards
Plateau (Johnson and Goode 1994;
McKinney 1981). This distribution may
indicate climatic conditions at the time,
given that these environments have more
reliable water sources and a more diverse
resource base than other parts of the region.
Artifact assemblages of the Early Archaic
include projectile points styles such as
Hoxie, Bulverde, Gower, Wells, Martindale,
and Uvalde, as well as early split stem
projectile points. A variety of choppers and
gouges, such as the triangular, concave
based bifaces known as Guadalupe tools,
and the distally beveled Clear Fork unifaces
19

Travis. Other artifacts from the Middle
Archaic are choppers, gouges, and
expediency tools such as the small, bifacial
and unifacial Clear Fork tools. Grinding
stones and bases, referred to as manos and
metates, show up in Middle Archaic artifact
assemblages as well as a number of
perforators, drills and awls. Chipped,
polished, and ground stone artifacts are
common in central Texas and surrounding
regions. Less frequently encountered
artifacts include tools and ornaments of
bone, antler, and marine shell (Turner and
Hester 1999).

others had a ratio as high as 3:1 small to
large features (Houk et al. 2008:13-18).
Ultimately, the researchers concluded that
supplementary data should be considered to
garner a more complete interpretation of
Early Archaic activities.
Some significant Early Archaic sites include
the Icehouse Site in Hays County (Oksanen
2008), Richard Beene site in Bexar County
(Thoms and Mandel 2007), the Camp Pearl
Wheat and Gatlin sites in Kerr County
(Collins et al. 1990; Houk et al. 2008), and
the Jetta Court site in Travis County
(Wesolowsky et al. 1976).

Cultural patterns during the Middle Archaic
period (6,000–4,000 B.P.), point toward an
increased sedentary population intensively
harvesting acorns, prickly pear “tuna”, and
pecans, and hunting small and medium-size
game such as deer and turkey. The increase
in the number of Middle Archaic sites and
burials supports the concept of a larger,
more sedentary population (Black and
McGraw 1985; Prewitt 1981:73; Weir
1976:124, 135). Large bands may have
formed at least seasonally to occupy a single
area, or small groups may have used the
same sites for longer periods (Weir
1976:130–131).

Bell and Andice points reflect a shift in
lithic technology from the preceding Early
Archaic Martindale and Uvalde point styles
(Collins 2004:120). Johnson and Goode
(1994:25) suggest that the Bell and Andice
darts are parts of a specialized bison-hunting
tool kit. They also believe that an influx of
bison and bison-hunting groups from the
Eastern Woodland margins during a slightly
more mesic period marked the beginning of
the Middle Archaic. Though no bison
remains were recovered, Bell and Andice
points and associated radiocarbon ages were
recovered from the Gatlin site (Houk et al.
2008), Cibolo Crossing (Kibler and Scott
2000), Panther Springs Creek, and Granberg
II (Black and McGraw 1985) sites in Bexar
County.

Sites of the Middle Archaic are numerous
and often large in size. Burned rock middens
are found at many sites with Middle and
Late Archaic components particularly in the
Central Texas archaeological region. The
development of burned rock middens toward
the end of the Middle Archaic suggests a
greater reliance on plant foods, although tool
kits still imply a considerable dependence on
hunting (Prewitt 1985:222–226). Middle
Archaic projectile point styles include Bell,
Andice, Calf Creek, Taylor, Nolan, and

Bison populations disappeared as more-xeric
conditions returned during the later part of
the Middle Archaic. Later Middle Archaic
projectile point styles (Nolan and Travis)
represent another shift in lithic technology
(Collins 2004:120–121; Johnson and Goode
1994:27). At the same time, this shift to
drier conditions saw the burned rock
middens develop, probably because
intensified use of geophytic or xerophytic
plants meant the debris from multiple rock
ovens and hearths accumulated as middens

MIDDLE ARCHAIC

20

The use of rock and earth ovens (and the
formation of burned rock middens) for
processing and cooking plant foods suggests
that this technology was part of a
generalized foraging strategy. Considering
the amount of energy involved in collecting
plants, constructing hot rock cooking
appliances, and gathering fuel, the caloric
return of most plant foods is relatively low
(Dering 1999). This suggests that plant
foods were part of a broad-based diet
(Kibler and Scott 2000:134) or part of a
generalized foraging strategy, an idea
Prewitt (1981) put forth earlier. At times
during the Late Archaic, this generalized
foraging strategy appears to have been
marked by shifts to a specialized economy
focused on bison hunting (Kibler and Scott
2000:125–137). Castroville, Montell, and
Marcos dart points are elements of tool kits
often associated with bison hunting (Collins
1968). Archaeological evidence of this
association is seen at Bonfire Shelter in Val
Verde County (Dibble and Lorrain 1968),
Jonas Terrace in Medina County (Johnson
1995), Oblate Rockshelter in Comal County
(Johnson et al. 1962:116), John Ischy in
Williamson County (Sorrow 1969), and
Panther Springs Creek in Bexar County
(Black and McGraw 1985).

on stable to slowly aggrading surfaces, as
Kelley and Campbell (1942) suggested
many years ago. Johnson and Goode
(1994:26) believe that the dry conditions
promoted the spread of yuccas and sotols,
and that it was these plants that Middle
Archaic peoples collected and cooked in
large rock ovens.
LATE ARCHAIC
During the succeeding Late Archaic period
(4,000 to 1,300–1,200 B.P.), populations
continued to increase (Prewitt 1985:217). As
evidenced by stratified Archaic sites such as
Loeve-Fox, Cibolo Crossing, and Panther
Springs Creek, the Late Archaic components
contain the densest concentrations of
cultural materials of all the Archaic periods.
Establishment of large cemeteries along
drainages also suggests certain groups had
strong territorial ties (Story 1985:40).
Middle Archaic subsistence technology,
including the use of rock and earth ovens,
continues into the Late Archaic period.
Collins (2004:121) states that, at the
beginning of the Late Archaic period, the
use of rock ovens and the resultant
formation of burned rock middens reached
its zenith and that the use of rock and earth
ovens declined during the latter half of the
Late Archaic. There is, however, mounting
chronological data that midden formation
culminated much later and that this high
level of rock and earth oven use continued
into the early Late Prehistoric period (Black
et al. 1997:270–284; Kleinbach et al.
1995:795). A picture of prevalent burned
rock midden development in the eastern part
of the Central Texas archaeological region
after 2,000 B.P. is gradually becoming clear.
This scenario parallels the widely
recognized occurrence of post-2,000 B.P.
middens in the western reaches of the
Edwards Plateau (Goode 1991).

TRANSITIONAL ARCHAIC
As Collins (2004:122–123) notes, diverse
and comparatively complex archaeological
manifestations toward the end of the Late
Archaic attest to the emergence of kinds of
human conduct without precedent in the
area. This period (2,250–1,250 B.P.),
referred to as the Transitional Archaic
(Turner and Hester 1999) or Terminal
Archaic (Black 1989), is not recognized by
all researchers. Other chronologies terminate
the Late Archaic at around 1,200–1,250 B.P.
(Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994) to
encompass this later subperiod. Johnson et
al. (1962) originally designated the
21

other groups of humans as they moved
through the surrounding creek valleys and
upland prairies (Houk et al. 1997).

Transitional Archaic as a subperiod of the
Archaic because of the similarities between
the latest dart point types and the earliest
arrow point types. Since then, however, the
designation has failed to be universally
accepted by researchers. In two recent
chronologies for central Texas, Collins
(2004) does not include the Transitional as a
subperiod of the Archaic, and Johnson and
Goode (1994) separate the Late Archaic into
two subperiods designated Late Archaic I
and Late Archaic II. The Transitional
Archaic, as it is used here, closely
corresponds to Johnson and Goode’s (1994)
Late Archaic II, but begins after the
appearance of Marcos points, not with it. In
this scheme, the Transitional Archaic
coincides with the last two style intervals
recognized by Collins (2004) for the Late
Archaic subperiod.

Overall, the Archaic period represents a
hunting and gathering way of life that was
successful and remained virtually unchanged
for more than 7,500 years. This notion is
based in part on fairly consistent artifact and
tool assemblages through time and place and
on resource patches that were used
continually for several millennia, as the
formation of burned rock middens show.
This pattern of generalized foraging, though
marked by brief shifts to a heavy reliance on
bison, continued almost unchanged into the
succeeding Late Prehistoric period.

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Introduction of the bow and arrow and, later,
ceramics into the Central and South Texas
archaeological regions marks the Late
Prehistoric period (1,250–350 B.P.).
Population densities dropped considerably
from their Late Archaic peak (Prewitt
1985:217). Subsistence strategies did not
differ greatly from the preceding period,
although bison again became an important
economic resource during the latter part of
the Late Prehistoric period (Prewitt
1981:74). Rock and earth ovens were
utilized for plant food processing (Black et
al. 1997; Kleinbach et al. 1995:795).
Horticulture came into play very late in the
region but was of seemingly minor
importance to overall subsistence strategies
(Collins 1995:385).

During the Transitional Archaic, smaller
dart point forms such as Darl, Ensor,
Fairland, and Frio were developed (Turner
and Hester 1999). These points were
probably ancestral to the first Late
Prehistoric arrow point types and may have
overlapped temporally with them (Carpenter
et al. 2006; Hester 1995; Houk and Lohse
1993).
Several researchers believe that the
increased interaction between groups at the
end of the Late Archaic was an important
catalyst for cultural change (Collins 2004;
Johnson and Goode 1994). This change may
have included increased regional stress and
conflict between groups as interaction
became more frequent (Houk et al. 1997). In
Bexar County, for instance, researchers
noted a distinct shift in settlement patterns
during this period (Houk et al. 1997).
Groups began to use hilltops as camps rather
than just lithic procurement locations. These
elevated locations would have provided
points from which to observe game and

Artifact assemblages include Scallorn,
Perdiz, and Edwards projectile points,
worked stone, thermally altered stone,
hematite, bone, and shell. The points are
associated with the use of the bow and arrow
in the region, probably introduced sometime
around 1,350–1,150 B.P.

of importance not witnessed since Folsom
times. Although the importance of bison
hunting and high group mobility hardly can
be disputed, the argument that burned rock
midden development ceased during the
Toyah phase is tenuous. A recent
examination of Toyah-age radiocarbon
assays and assemblages by Black et al.
(1997) suggests that their association with
burned rock middens represents more than a
“thin veneer” capping Archaic-age features.
Black et al. (1997) claim that burned rock
midden formations, although not as
prevalent as in earlier periods, was part of
the adaptive strategies of Toyah peoples.

The earlier Austin phase (identified by
Scallorn and Edwards points) and the later
Toyah phase (defined through Perdiz points)
divide the Late Prehistoric period
throughout central Texas (Black 1989; Story
1990). These divisions were originally
recognized by Suhm (1960) and Jelks
(1962), and remain an accepted separation
of the period. Although a distinct change in
the material culture between the two phases
can be seen in the archaeological record,
there is some debate over the cultural
underpinnings that prompted the change.
The different arrow point styles (and other
associated artifacts in the assemblage) may
represent distinct cultural groups (Johnson
1994), but others challenge this view (e.g.,
Black and Creel 1997), and attribute the
change to a spread of new technological
ideas in response to the increase of a
different economic resource in bison
populations (Ricklis 1992). Nevertheless,
prehistoric communities traced through
cultural remains assigned to the Austin
phase (1,250–650 B.P.), like many of the
Archaic period cultures before them, relied
on a hunting and gathering subsistence with
more of an emphasis on gathering (Prewitt
1981:83). Communities attributed to the
Toyah phase (650–200 B.P.) relied more on
bison procurement (Prewitt 1981:84).

HISTORIC CULTURE SETTING
Landscape features have dictated human
movement and subsistence patterns for
thousands
of
years.
Specifically,
geographical influences during the Historic
Period confined settlements to riparian
zones and limited farming to these areas.
The larger rugged landscape was used for
sheep, goat and cattle ranching. These
practices were introduced and promoted by
the Spanish as part of their colonial agenda
and many were carried through to the
twentieth century, giving Texas a strong
agricultural history dominating economic,
social and cultural patterns over the years
(Freeman 1994).

Around 1,000–750 B.P., slightly more-xeric
or drought-prone climatic conditions
returned to the region, and bison came back
in large numbers (Huebner 1991; Toomey
1993). Using this vast resource, Toyah
peoples were equipped with Perdiz pointtipped arrows, end scrapers, four-bevelededge knives, and plain bone-tempered
ceramics. Toyah technology and subsistence
strategies represent a completely different
tradition from the preceding Austin phase.
Collins (1995:388) states that formation of
burned rock middens ceased as bison
hunting and group mobility obtained a level

The Historic period in this region (1630 A.
D. to Present) in Texas roughly begins when
Europeans first enter the region. However,
several sixteenth century expeditions have
been reported to the area. Most notably
Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca's travels
stemming from the failed 1527 Panfilo de
Narvaez expedition. Cabeza de Vaca
reportedly lived and traveled with various
aboriginal groups across coastal and interior
Texas around A.D. 1528 (Chipman 2011;
Foster 2012; Krieger 2002). Although

23

also introduced livestock and ranching
practices that would influence generations of
Texans. Sheep, goats, cattle, and hogs were
shipped in to create mission and private
ranches. These ranches were developed as a
means to create an autonomous settlement
system in a relatively hostile environment
prone to attacks by the Comanche, Apache,
and Norteños.

Cabeza de Vaca’s exact path is not clear, his
journey likely passed further south of the
proposed IIIC alignment closer to present
day Freer, Texas (Krieger 2002).
SPANISH COLONIAL PERIOD (A.D. 1630 –
1820)
Motivated more by a fear of French
expansion than anything else, the Spanish
explored and established missions in eastern
and central Texas during the latter part of
the 17th century (Foster 1995). The first
Europeans to pass near the project area were
probably Spanish explorers and missionaries
with “sword and cross” coming northward
from Mexico City (Foster 1995; Weddle
1968). With the exception of these Spanish
expeditions or ‘entradas’, Texas during the
early Historic Period was claimed by Spain
but basically remained without an
established Spanish presence until around
1700 A. D. (Foster 1995). These entrada
routes typically followed established Indian
trade routes, were the genesis of the Spanish
road system throughout Texas. These
Spanish roads have been incorporated into
the Texas highway network that is in use
today (Foster 1995:1). The first early
overland Spanish entrada in vicinity of the
IIIC alignments was led by Governor
Alonso de Léon, which passed between
present day Uvalde and Pearsall, Texas in
1689 and 1690 (Foster 1995:17–49).

By the end of the eighteenth century,
ranching practices were on the rise. Spurred
on by demands from eastern markets, Texas
ranches flourished. Further, east Texas
missions were secularized in 1794, creating
a greater need for meat and other goods
(Freeman 1994). As a result of the changing
economic and political environment, the
proliferation of private ranches increased
over time. Eighteenth century Spanish
ranching practices were carried into the
nineteenth century, having an influence on
European and American settlers moving into
Texas from both Europe and the older states
of the southeast. This influence included the
introduction of: twice-a-year breeding; the
choice of specific breeds; the establishment
of specific ranching methods; terminology;
and organization (Freeman 1994:10).
MEXICO AND THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS
(1821-1845)
The beginning of the nineteenth century
proved difficult for Spain. The Napoleonic
wars left the country in an economic and
political crisis, which was greatly felt in the
territories of New Spain. After years of
struggle, threats from the United States to
the north and east, and the breakdown of
government organization, Mexico finally
gained its independence in 1821 (de la Teja
2011).

Subsequent overland entradas into the
eighteenth century generally followed de
Léon’s early route, which became the Upper
Presidio Road from 1795–1850 (McGraw et
al. 1991). This route generally follows IH-35
roadway that marks the southern terminus of
the IIIC alignment.
Spanish
expeditions
throughout
the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
established not only the mission system but

Ranching practices began to shift even more
during this time with an influx of new

settlers from the southern United States and
Europe. Under Spanish law, foreigners were
initially forbidden to settle in Spanish lands.
However, due to a dearth of settlers willing
to travel into the dangerous northern regions
of New Spain, the government made
allowances. By 1820, Texas was opened and
settlers arrived in waves under the authority
of men like Stephen F. Austin, taking
advantage of cheap land and liberal laws
under Spain and then Mexico (Henson
2011). Their influences added to methods of
breeding and herding practices in the area,
building on established Spanish colonial
traditions. The colonists also brought new
crops and farming practices with them. In
fact, the anti-slavery ideals of Mexico were
set aside by Mexican officials in Texas to
lure Anglo settlers with much desired
agricultural practices from southern states.
Settlers also moved to Texas with the idea
that the area would soon be annexed by the
United States and would be a worthy
investment as more people moved west.
Further, Texas functioned as a safe-haven
from debt, granting debt-laden families and
individuals a clean start (Henson 2011).

By 1835, Texans were growing unhappy and
restless. The Mexican government had failed
to provide the liberal and democratic
environment that many European and
American settlers had envisioned. The
republican ideals established in the
Constitution of 1824 were pushed aside and
replaced by a growing dictatorship lead by
Antonio López de Santa Anna. Texans
decided to handle the crisis swiftly by
creating a series of assemblies and a
provisional government. Wrought with
internal strife, the Texans did not fully
organize until a convention meeting was
held at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March
1, 1836. The convention appointed Sam
Houston as Commander in chief of the new
Revolutionary Army and made rapid
decisions about a new government, a new
constitution, and the possibility of war
(Nance 2011).
The next several months would prove
challenging to the new government and
Texas settlers. News of the fall of the Alamo
in early March, 1836, reached settlers
quickly. South Central Texas was one of the
first areas affected by the news due to close
proximity to San Antonio. As Sam Houston
retreated in late March, settlers followed,
creating a large scale exodus out of Texas.
Known as the Runaway Scrape, the flight
out of Texas continued at a steady pace until
the decisive Battle of San Jacinto in late
April. After Houston’s victory at San
Jacinto, settlers began to slowly make their
way back to their farms and ranches only to
find missing cattle and damaged property
(Covington 2011).

In the early years of the Mexican republic,
the new government made every attempt to
live up to the Plan de Iguala, created in
1821 as Mexico pushed for independence.
This plan called for the preservation and
importance of the Catholic Church, for the
equality of Mexican citizens, and for
Mexican independence as a constitutional
monarchy (de la Teja 2011). The Mexican
Constitution of 1824 further established
these goals. Modeled after the United States
Constitution in format, and the Spanish
Constitution of 1812 in spirit, the document
established an American-style judicial,
legislative and executive branch system with
the publicly funded Catholic Church as the
official faith. Texas was represented by José
María Erasmo Seguín at the constitutional

25

By late 1836, Texas had defeated Mexico,
created a new constitution, and elected a
new executive, judicial, and legislative staff.
Sam Houston led the new Republic of Texas
as president and Stephen F. Austin acted as
secretary of state. The new government
worked quickly to create the Texas postal
system, create an organized militia, and
establish the Republic of Texas boundaries.
Sam Houston also worked with land grant
issues and settlers rights. By the end of the
Texas Revolution, Texas had over
251,000,000 acres of land as public domain.
This land was not only used to support
public works in the new Republic of Texas,
but also to encourage further settlement.
Generous grants were provided to veterans
of the war. Land grants of 1,280 acres for
head of families and 640 acres for single
men were offered to settlers arriving in
Texas in 1836-37. New settlers were
required to live in Texas at least three years
to receive their land title (Nance 2011).
Texas also attempted to sell land to new
settlers well below the going rate at the time.
Running into organizational trouble with
grants and sales, the first homestead laws
went into effect in 1839. This law granted
50 acres or one town lot to every citizen or
head of family (Nance 2011).

Texas would become a slave state instead of
a territory and also retain the ability to keep
public lands and debts. Texas would also
have the capability to divide into four
additional states if needed and the United
States Navy would offer protection along the
Gulf coast. New statehood created a flurry
of activity and settlement. New counties
were established in the area including:
Kinney in 1850; Maverick in 1856; Frio,
Zavala, and Edwards in 1858; and Sutton in
1887 (Hosmer 2012; Long 2012; McCrain
2012; Ochoa 2012a, 2012b, and 2012c).
Despite a constant threat of Indian raids and
the occasional threat of starvation, settlers
continued to arrive in the area, taking
advantage of available land under the Preemption Act of 1845 and the Homestead Act
of 1845 (Curtis 1943). Scouting trips to the
area also reported an abundance and variety
of wild game, picturesque hills and streams,
and ideal country for livestock grazing.
United States forts were also established
throughout the western edge of the
established frontier to offer protection to
settlers.
German and Anglo-American settlers
adapted quickly to the new landscape.
Breeding experiments with native and
imported goats and sheep produced hybrid
animals suited to the Hill Country
environment.
Capitalizing
on
their
successful breeding experiments, German
families often built mills to produce cloth.
This effort was timed perfectly to meet an
increased demand for wool cloth over cotton
within the larger context of the United
States. Wool manufacturing techniques were
also becoming more streamlined, enabling
faster production. Further, low land prices
and a favorable climate lured ranchers from
other parts of the United States. These
factors, in conjunction with George Wilkins
Kendall’s wool promotion campaign

The Republic of Texas also encouraged
larger settlements of new immigrants
through land grants and colonization
contracts. These efforts garnered varying
levels of success, but minimally opened the
door to a wave of German immigrants into
the region that would last throughout the
years of the nineteenth century and create
important cultural and social contributions
to development of the Texas Hill Country.

STATES (1845-1861)

gold. Routes also existed through Arkansas
and Missouri but Texas offered warmer
weather and thus an earlier start date. Texas
also had an established trail system which
was mapped during the Mexican American
War, and a recently created military route
running from San Antonio to El Paso
(Wallace 2008). Due to the influx and
movement of people across the state, new
webs of connection were established linking
town sites and settlements. The condition of
these trails and roads would remain in poor
condition for years to come with upkeep in
the hands of local governments (Wallace
2008). The first rail system in Texas was
built in the 1850s, connecting Houston to
Cypress. However, true progress on this
front would not be seen until the
reconstruction years (Werner 2011).

activities, created the first “sheep boom” in
Texas. Cattle numbers were also on the rise
and by the onset of the Civil War; Texas had
more than 3.5 million head, outnumbering
all other states (Freeman 1994).
Until
the
early-twentieth
century,
transportation and circulation routes in
Texas remained rudimentary and fairly
disconnected. Spanish Colonial roads took
advantage of existing Native American trails
initially to access interior portions of the
territory. Later, settlers from the United
States and other European countries
continued to use established trails and
created new ones as they entered the region.
By the early- to mid- nineteenth century,
most of the roads in Texas were created by
sustained use and ease of access rather than
by design (Wallace 2008).

THE CIVIL WAR (1861-1865)

Efforts to create a coherent transportation
system began in the first years of the
Republic of Texas. The young Republic of
Texas created a Commissioner of Roads and
Revenue along with the Texas Rail Road
Navigation and Banking Company (Wallace
2008; Werner 2011). Lack of funds plagued
both, leaving existing roads in poor
condition with no hope for the establishment
of new circulation systems. Road
development and maintenance responsibility
primarily fell to the counties, which
appointed a local overseer and crew. This
group of selected men, usually comprised of
local land owners, rotated every few months.
Therefore, road building in the early years of
the Republic of Texas and through the rest
of the nineteenth century, was primarily a
local endeavor, shared by the community.

Texas was a divided state as the Civil War
began in 1861. The new state had fought
hard to be granted admission to the Union,
however, ties to the older states of the south,
including slavery and agricultural practices,
were strong. In fact, the majority of the
established and growing Anglo population
came from southern states. This group saw
the Civil War and the election of President
Abraham Lincoln as a threat to the State of
Texas and its southern heritage and
institutions (Campbell 2011).
Texas Hill Country counties were even more
divided with narrow margins winning in
favor of secession. The vote against
secession was led by the large number of
German settlers in the area. By 1861,
Germans in Kerr, Gillespie and Kendall
Counties created the Union League to create
organized groups to fight against local
native raids and Confederate threats. Seen as
an act of rebellion against the State of Texas
and the Confederacy, troops were called in
to quell the group. Finding themselves in a

True progress for roads came about through
the California Gold Rush (ca. 1850). During
that time, Texas functioned as a staging
ground for thousands heading west to
California on the news of the discovery of

27

access to the Edwards Plateau (Freeman
1994). In fact, railroads would eventually
eclipse roads in focus and importance as
they pulled in funding from both the State
and outside resources. The Texas Railroad
commission was established in 1891 to
regulate the powerful railroad companies.
By 1900, Texas had more miles of track
than any other state in the Union; however,
these lines still left much of the expansive
western half of Texas with little or no rail
access despite railroad growth (Werner
2011; Wallace 2008).

dangerous situation, the Unionists decided to
flee to Mexico. They were intercepted and
attacked by Confederate troops on the
Nueces River in Kinney County in what is
now known as the Battle of the Nueces.
While the division over succession and the
outcome of the Battle of Nueces (seen by
many German settlers as a massacre) created
tensions between Anglo and Germans even
after the Civil War was over, the counties in
the Hill Country recovered from the war
quickly with successful agriculture and
ranching practices in place for future growth
(Odintz 2011). The exact location of this
event is not officially marked. However,
most accounts generally place it east of
Brackettville, Texas and west of the Nueces
River. This area is well east of the proposed
IIIC alignment and will be avoided.

By the mid-1880s to early-1890s, the wool
boom and the cattle industry were in decline
brought on by over-grazed grasslands;
extreme weather conditions including
drought and harsh winters; and the
introduction of barbed wire. In addition, the
Texas economy was heavily impacted by the
Panic of 1893, which was a severe economic
depression brought on by bank failures and
over speculation in railroad construction.
Sheep and cattle ranchers generally pulled
through, reorganizing ranching practices and
creating support systems and organizations
for protection and promotion (Freeman
1994). Diversification of ranching and
farming also became more popular.
Ranchers focused their attention specifically
on mohair production and Angora goats,
setting the stage for the growth and boom of
that industry into the twentieth century
(Freeman 1994).

RECONSTRUCTION AND GROWTH (1865 –
1899)
The Hill Country counties and settlements
recovered quickly from the Civil War. As
mentioned above, George Wilkins Kendall
promoted goat and sheep ranching in Texas
throughout the United States. As a result, the
industries survived the war and went on to
create a second wool or sheep boom through
the mid-1880s. Key factors influencing the
success of sheep ranching at this time
included the influx of both northern and
southern ranchers to the area, the removal
and destruction of the buffalo herds along
with Native populations to the west
(allowing for new, open pastureland), and
higher wool prices (Freeman 1994).

THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY – THE
ADVANCEMENT OF RANCHING,
INFRASTRUCTURE AND TOURISM (19001940).

The development of ranching infrastructure
also helped establish the sheep, goat, and
cattle industries in the area. Systems of
markets and warehouses with specific
architectural features designed to package,
store, and sell wool and mohair were
created. Railway systems further aided
ranching activities farther west, creating

Smaller, adept, diversified farms and
ranches dominated the landscape of the
Edwards Plateau by 1900. The “ranching
triumvirate” of cattle, sheep and Angora
goats set Texas at the national forefront of
ranching production (Freeman 1994: 18).
28

Spanish Trail Transcontinental Highway
(American Highway Association 1917;
Luther 2010).

Agricultural crops, such as cotton, corn,
wheat, oats, and various grasses for hay
production further diversified output,
strengthening independent farms and
ranches (Freeman 1994).

The creation of good roads not only enabled
farmers and ranchers to get products to
markets and railways easier, but also
enabled motorists to take advantage of the
Texas Hill Country. The Texas Highway
Department responded to this growing need
by designing and improving supporting
infrastructure such as bridges and road side
stops.

As railways continued to be built well into
the twentieth century, new roads followed,
creating a linked network. Rails functioned
as the “main arteries of travel” and roads as
“the veins” (Pratt 1910:106). Railroad
companies soon realized that a good road
system could greatly aid their business and
they became one of the most ardent
supporters of the good roads movement
(Wallace 2008). Road systems also
benefitted from the arrival of post offices.
The Rural Free Delivery of Mail system
(RFD) brought mail to isolated ranches and
farms. Postmen refused to use roads in poor
conditions and consistently reported
conditions to the proper authorities when
they could not make their deliveries. This
system united rural roads and post routes
engaging federal and state government
interests. This new level of involvement
with roads and their development stretched
significantly beyond the previous scope of
county court control (Wallace 2008).

Despite
advancements
made
in
infrastructure technology and funding,
ranching, and the nascent tourism industry,
the depression took its toll on the towns,
farms, and ranches of the Texas Hill
Country. Because the area was primarily
rural, the effects of the depression were not
felt initially. However, by the early 1930s,
changes began to occur in local economies.
The Texas legislature responded, and in
1931 all state agencies were required to use
only
American-made
materials
and
machinery in all new construction projects.
The Texas Highway Department worked
together with the legislature to make sure
Texas firms and material suppliers received
all of the contracts for road and bridge work.
As the depression advanced, the state
legislature and the Texas Highway
Department looked for other ways to
increase the number of jobs for out-of-work
Texans. In 1932, the Texas Highway
Department mandated that machines should
be used as a last result and all construction
should be built by hand when at all possible.
In that same year, Texas began to receive
federal aid under the Emergency Relief and
Construction Act. Funding continued under
Roosevelt’s New Deal Programs, which
covered 100 percent of the costs and aided
in economic recovery throughout the state
(Wallace 2008).

The fate of road improvement and system
expansion was sealed with the introduction
of the automobile and the Federal Highway
Act of 1916 and 1917. The new acts
provided matching funding to states and a
regulatory partnership to assist with building
plans (location, design, and cost estimates).
In response to these Acts, the Texas
Highway Department was established in
1917. Not soon after, the Highway
Department would become the largest
agency in the state (Wallace 2008). By
1917, Texas was well on its way to creating
a new and complete highway system. The
system included several national marked
highway routes including the nascent Old

29

The smaller towns along the western edge of
the Hill Country attracted hunters and
fishermen along with other types of tourism.
Tourism also greatly influenced the steady
population growth in the region through the
twentieth century (Thompson 2011; Smyrl
2011; Lich 2011).

Farms and ranches also suffered during the
depression. A severe drought in the early
1930s left many farms and ranches in
decline. The number of unemployed
residents in the area also jumped, more than
doubling between 1930 and 1936
(Thompson 2011). Smaller towns and less
populated counties also saw a dramatic
population decrease and people moved to
larger towns in the area to look for work
(Smyrl 2011). Despite the difficulties of the
depression, many ranches and farms
survived with lands and livestock intact.
This is partly due to the push for smaller,
more diversified practices which began in
the early years of the twentieth century.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review consisted of a
cultural resource and environmental
literature review of the proposed IIIC
alignment. An SWCA archaeologist
reviewed the corresponding USGS 7.5minute topographic quadrangle maps on the
Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas online
database for any previously recorded
surveys and historic or prehistoric sites
located in or near the Project area. An
SWCA archaeologist also examined
documents on file at the Texas
Archaeological Research Laboratory at the
University of Texas Austin and at the THC
to find documents related to these projects
that were not available online. These sources
provided information on the nature and
location
of
previously
conducted
archaeological surveys and previously
recorded cultural resource sites. The Texas
Historic Sites Overlay, aerial photographs,
Bureau of Economic Geology Maps, and the
Natural Resources Conservation Service’s
Web Soil Survey, were also examined for
historical and environmental information
within the project area.

THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY 1940S –
60S.
Goat, sheep, and cattle ranching remained in
the forefront of Texas Hill Country
commerce well into the mid-twentieth
century. Agricultural crop production of
wheat, sorghum, cotton, pecans, and oats
continued on farms and ranches.
New commercial opportunities rose in the
oil and gas businesses throughout the region
while road and electrical infrastructure
steadily improved. The years of 1941 and
early 1942 saw a boom period for highway
construction. While World War II hampered
efforts due to a decrease in supplies, man
power, and revenue from automobile
registration, plans were made for the future.
As a result, delegates from the Texas Good
Road Association asked Washington for
$768 million for road repair due to neglect
during the years of the war. Congress
responded with a $1.5 billion dollar postwar highway bill. Texas received the largest
percentage of these funds. Due to this, by
the late 1940s, most of the roads in the
Texas Hill Country were paved and new
construction projects were completed in
record time (Wallace 2008).

FIELD METHODS
HPA DELINEATION
Based on the nature of the regulatory
conditions and due to the overall upland
setting and generally shallow nature of soils

30

disturbed or upland setting with near-surface
bedrock exposures was encountered. In such
cases, the field director or team lead
modified the shovel testing regime
accordingly. As expected, ground-truthing
of the HPAs resulted in frequent adjustments
to the survey efforts, given the prevalence of
extensive farming and ranching activities in
the area which has considerably altered the
character of the landscape.

throughout the Sand Hills Phase IIIC route,
a targeted survey of HPAs was selected in
favor of a 100 percent survey of the entire
route. Specifically, an approach that utilized
specific criteria (e.g., proximity to water) to
identify areas with a high probability of
containing intact cultural resources was
developed. The approach and identified high
probability areas that were agreed upon by
DCP and the USACE prior to the
commencement of field work.

The probability model delineated a total of
132 individual HPAs within the proposed
IIIC alignment. The majority of the HPAs
had an average length of approximately
2,500 feet (usually centered on either side of
a waterway). Several of the HPAs were
lengthened to traverse longer expanses
where the line crosses waterways with large
floodplains, such as the Leona River. In all,
the HPAs within Phase IIIC have a total
length of roughly 79.2 miles (127.5 km)
encompassing 960 acres.

The determination of high and low
probability areas along the roughly 198-mile
route was based on the examination of
numerous variables in a GIS database,
including the nature of previously recorded
cultural resources in proximity to the project
area, topography, soils, proximity to water,
results of the historic archival studies, and
man-made disturbances such as extant
infrastructure and agricultural fields.
Specifically for this study, HPAs were
defined as locales that possess or have an
elevated likelihood of containing cultural
resources, particularly significant ones. As
part of this process, SWCA reviewed
existing cultural resource databases, historic
maps and records, and available aerial
imagery to develop target-specific HPAs.
Overall, the GIS-based probability modeling
used in the HPA development serves to
streamline and focus survey efforts in
USACE jurisdictional areas with the highest
potential for intact cultural resources.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD SURVEY
SWCA investigations focused on terraces
and floodplains adjacent to prominent
drainages and tributaries. Some of the
waterways intersected by the proposed
alignment include Perdido, Elm, Pinto and
Las Moras creeks (Kinney County), Palo
Blanco
creek
(Maverick
County),
Chaparrosa creek and the Nueces River
(Zavala County), and Todos Santos creek
and the Leona and Frio rivers (Frio County).

The HPA designation is intrinsically flexible
so that new variables may be implemented
into the model at any time, resulting in
adjustments in HPA lengths or locations. A
number of HPAs along the length of the line
were individually fine-tuned based on the
data gathered from the background and
historic records research, as well as aerial
imagery. Similarly survey intensity within
any HPA was adjusted when a heavily

The general survey consisted of one to two
crews of three archaeologists lead by a crew
chief walking the HPAs, examining the
ground surface, documenting modifications
and disturbances, and utilizing shovel tests
and cutbank exposures to test for subsurface
archaeological deposits and assess the
geomorphic setting of the area. Shovel tests
were performed in areas that (a) did not

31

Trenches were excavated to a depth
sufficient to determine the presence/absence
of buried cultural materials and allow the
complete recording of any features and
geomorphic information to depths of project
impacts. Backhoe trenches were 6–8 m long,
1.5 m wide, and inspected after being
excavated to 120–150 cm in depth.
Subsequent to the documentation of the
trench profile, when deemed appropriate
excavations occasionally resumed until
achieving 2.5–3 m in depth. The back dirt of
the deeper deposits were examined for
cultural materials and the profile was
examined from outside the trench for any
notable strata. All trenching was monitored
by an experienced archaeologist while
excavations were underway. Stratigraphic
profiles and soils descriptions were recorded
for each trench by an experienced
archaeologist. All features encountered
during trenching were mapped and
photographed. All Occupational Safety and
Health Standards (OSHA) safety protocols
are utilized in these trenches and trenches
were backfilled and leveled upon
completion of excavation and recording.

show signs of extensive prior disturbance,
and (b) consisted of soils believed to hold
the potential for buried deposits close
enough to the surface to be detected through
this method of subsurface investigation.
Shovel tests were excavated along a single
transect at intervals of 100 m. Each shovel
test measured roughly 30 by 30 centimeters
(cm) in size and was excavated in 20-cm
arbitrary levels to one meter (m) in depth or
to archaeologically sterile subsoil. The
matrix was screened through ¼-inch mesh.
The location of each shovel test was plotted
using a GPS receiver, and each test recorded
on appropriate project field forms.
In areas exhibiting deep alluvial soils,
namely the floodplain of the Nueces River
and Frio River, subsurface investigations
consisted of backhoe trenches. In these
areas, trenches were usually placed 100–300
m apart, with tighter intervals if necessary.
Due to proposed HDD at these waterways,
the backhoe trench investigations began at
roughly 200–250 m (650–800 feet) from the
channel and proceeded outward until
encountering a landform containing apparent
Pleistocene deposits. Trench placement
across the floodplain was based on the level
of disturbance within the project area, the
location of buried utilities and pipelines,
vegetation, and restrictions imposed by
landowners with concerns for their
livestock. The trenching effort required
close coordination with third-party line
locators given the proximity of the proposed
alignment to existing buried pipelines. If
there were doubts that a trench could be
excavated safely (i.e., without hitting a
buried electrical line or pipeline) the planned
trench was moved to a location where all the
underground utilities could be located with
confidence.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
Within a 1-mile radius (1.6 km) of the
proposed centerline, there have been six
archaeological investigations, three linear
and three area projects, conducted between
1970 and 2007 (Atlas 2012; Hester 1978).
Of these six projects, five directly intersect
the proposed centerline. The earliest project
began in 1970 with an archaeological survey
of roughly 60,000 acres of the Chaparrosa
Ranch west of La Pryor in Zavala County
(Hester 1978). This work was conducted by
University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA)
for a long-term research project to better
understand southern Texas prehistory. These

investigations culminated in the recording of
about 200 prehistoric and historic
archaeological
sites
(Hester
1978).
Accordingly, several seasons (1974 and
1975) of investigations involving survey and
data recovery excavations followed (Hester
1978; Montgomery 1978). Only two of the
Chaparrosa Ranch sites (41ZV96 and
41ZV181) are in proximity to the IIIC
alignment. These sites are discussed below.

Site 41KY160 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
in Kinney County, 16 miles northwest of the
town of Brackettville, Texas. The site is
situated on a ridge overlooking an unnamed
tributary of the east fork of Sycamore Creek,
on the northeast side of FM 3008. The site
was recorded in January of 2012 and
consists of a dense surface scatter of
prehistoric lithics. One shovel test was
excavated and did not encounter any cultural
material (Atlas 2012).

Other early projects were conducted in 1981
on behalf of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) and the Texas
Department of Highways and Public
Transportation (TDHPT) and were generally
linear in nature. Additional surveys were
conducted in 1995, 2003 and 2007 on behalf
of the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) and the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA). Additional surveys
may have been conducted within the study
area but are not currently listed in the Atlas
database.

Site 41MV99 is a Late Archaic site in
Maverick County, 28 km northwest of the
town of La Pryor, Texas and 80 m north of
the IIIC alignment. The site is situated in the
floodplain of Buck Hollow Creek south of
Goofy Lake and US 377. Recorded in 1981,
the site consists of a sparse surficial scatter
of debitage and a Marcos Point in an area
disturbed by erosion and tank building. No
further work was recommended (Atlas
2012).

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
Within one mile of the currently proposed
centerline there are 74 archaeological sites
recorded in the Texas Atlas database of
archaeological sites. Of these, only eight
sites (41ED14, 41KY160, 41MV99,
41ZV96, 41ZV181, 41ZV443, 41ZV455
and 41ZV459) are within 100 m of the
proposed centerline For purposes of brevity,
only those sites directly on or adjacent to the
centerline will be summarized below.

Site 41ZV96 is a Middle Archaic open
campsite in Zavala County, 12 kilometers
(km) southwest of the town of La Pryor,
Texas. The site is situated on the western
floodplain of an unnamed tributary of
Turkey Creek 2.7 km south of Highway 57.
Recorded in 1970 during the Chaparrosa
Ranch survey, the site consists of dense
debitage, burned rock and a Pedernales
Point;
however,
no
features
or
concentrations were noted (Atlas 2012). No
recommendation was made regarding further
work or NRHP eligibility.

Site 41ED14 is a prehistoric site in Edwards
County, 7 km southwest of the town of
Carta Valley, Texas. The site is situated on
the northwest terrace overlooking a small
unnamed tributary of Red Bluff Creek just
south of US 377. Recorded in 1983, the site
consists of a sparse surficial scatter of

Site 4ZV181 is a prehistoric open
occupation site in Zavala County, 15.8 km
west of the town of La Pryor, Texas. The

33

site is situated on the east floodplain of
Chaparrosa Creek 130 m north of Highway
57. Recorded in 1974 during the Chaparrosa
Ranch survey, the site consists of dense
debitage, mussel shell, hearths, burned rock
and a triangular biface in an area minimally
disturbed by erosion (Atlas 2012). No
recommendation was made regarding further
work or NRHP eligibility.

CEMETERIES

Site 41ZV443 is located in Zavala County,
11.4 km southwest of the town of La Pryor,
Texas. No information regarding site type,
NRHP eligibility or recommendations was
available at TARL or on Atlas.

One historic marker is within a 1-mile radius
of the proposed centerline. The Seminole
Indian Scouts Cemetery Historic Marker is
located across FM 3348 from the cemetery,
four miles south of Brackettville, Texas.

Site 41ZV455 is a possible Late Paleoindian
site located in Zavala County, 1.3 km due
west of the intersection of US Highway 57
and Chaparrosa Creek. The site, recorded by
SWCA in 2006, consists of one Angostura
projectile point, two utilized flakes, one
core, one bifacial preform, and at least 20
pieces of debitage. Also present were a
sparse scatter of fire-cracked rock and a few
mussel shell fragments. The site has been
heavily impacted by the construction of U.S.
Highway 57 and little was intact at the time
of survey. Based on the level of disturbance,
site 41ZV455 was recommended for no
further work (Atlas 2012).

NATIONAL REGISTER DISTRICTS

One cemetery is within a 1-mile radius of
the proposed centerline. The Seminole
Indian Scouts Cemetery is located four miles
south of Brackettville, Texas just south of
FM 3348.
HISTORIC MARKERS

No National Register Properties or Districts
are located within a 1-mile radius of the
proposed centerline.

FIELD SURVEY
Between August 2011 and May 2012,
SWCA archaeologists examined 132 HPAs,
totaling 79.2 miles (127.5 km) or 960 acres
in support of the Sand Hills 198-mile Phase
IIIC Pipeline Project. Of the total area
surveyed, XX HPAs, totaling XX miles (XX
km) or XX acres fall within the current
(June 2012) alignment (Figure 2; Appendix
A.1–107). The remaining HPAs are within
previously proposed alignments that no
longer overlap the project corridor due to
subsequent engineering and landowner
requested reroutes.

Site 41ZV459 is a prehistoric site in Zavala
County, 11.5 km northeast of the town of
Loma Vista, Texas. The site is situated on
the western bank of the Leona River just
south of FM 117. Recorded in 2010, the site
consists of a sparse surficial scatter of
debitage in a heavily disturbed context. No
features were observed but some of the
surficial debitage appeared to be heat treated
(Atlas 2012). No recommendation was made
regarding further work or NRHP eligibility.

The examination of the 132 HPAs was
conducted within a 100-foot-wide survey
corridor utilizing pedestrian inspection with
shovel testing (n=1,483), backhoe trenching
(n=27), and inspection of available
exposures (e.g., vertical cut-banks, erosional
channels) (Appendices B and C). Within the
designated HPAs, 1,483 shovel test

excavations were conducted accounting for
18.7 shovel tests per mile or one every 86 m.
These excavation intervals exceed those
typically recommended by the THC, which
are 16 shovel tests per mile or one every 100
m. Of those 1,483 shovel tests, 218 (15
percent) were positive for cultural materials.
Also, 44 new archaeological sites, seven
previously recorded sites were revisited, and
28 isolated finds (IFs) were documented
during the course of the IIIC field
investigations (Tables 2 and 3).

Shovel tests within the southern half of the
IIIC alignment (n=801) often reached depths
of 50 cmbs or greater, especially when in
close proximity to major waterways, such as
the Frio River, Leona River, Todos Santos
Creek, and the Nueces River (Appendix
A.1–107).
The mean elevation continually rises to the
northwest as the IIIC alignment traverses the
northern portion of the South Texas Plains
and
transitions
to
the
Edwards
Plateau/Balconian
ecological
region
(McMahan et al. 1984). Elevations within
the northern half of the IIIC alignment range
between 1,100 feet AMSL in southern
Kinney County to 2,100–2,200 feet AMSL
in central Sutton County. Investigations
through this portion of the alignment
routinely documented rugged, rocky
topography with very shallow soil or
bedrock exposures at the surface. The
heavily eroded hill country landscape is
marked by deeply incised, ephemeral
waterways and steep, stair-stepped slopes
(Cretaceous Period limestone, siltstone, and
shale [Barnes 1976; Fisher 1977, 1981]).
Natural outcrops of chert were fairly
uncommon within the linear project area
and, when encountered, invariably coincided
with lithic quarries or temporary campsites.

The general setting of the proposed IIIC
alignment can be characterized as a rural
ranching
environment
with
limited
residential and commercial development.
Based on physiographic distinctions, the
IIIC alignment can be further broken into
southern (Frio through southern Kinney
Counties) and northern (southern Kinney
through Sutton Counties) halves. The
eastern terminus of IIIC is situated at around
480 feet AMSL, within the South Texas
Plains/Tamaulipan ecological region of Frio,
Zavala, Maverick, and (southern) Kinney
Counties (McMahan et al. 1984). This area
is characterized by gently undulating
topography; broad drainage basins with
moderately deep, alluvial soils, contrasted
with gradual rises, shallow soil, and cherty
gravels across the surface. Prehistoric camps
were frequently encountered within the
alluvial settings, along valley margins where
lithic resources are readily available.

Thorny scrub brush retains a presence
through this area, with heavy cedar/juniper
encroachment that spurred from historic
fencing of rangeland and selective foraging
(TPWD 2012). The eroded landscape
provides excellent surface visibility, which
typically exceeds 75 percent within the IIIC
alignment. Shovel tests in this portion of the

Vegetation in this area, commonly known as
“South Texas Brush Country,” consists of
mesquite trees and low, thorny scrub brush,
including blackbrush and Spanish dagger,
among others (Figure 3). Typical surface
visibility is between 40–70 percent,
depending upon the presence of prairie
grasses such as little bluestem. A small
portion of the alignment also passes through

were defined by three or less artifacts within
a discrete location. Standard site delineation
was utilized in these locations, however, no
additional cultural material was identified.
Isolated finds were usually documented on
the ground surface rather than within shovel
tests.

IIIC alignment (n=682) were frequently
terminated at limestone bedrock at less than
30 cmbs (Appendix B).
Disturbance across the proposed alignment
varied in extent and severity. The most
common impacts are associated with
agricultural land modification for cropland
or cattle, goat, and sheep ranching (Figure
4). Where the alignment crosses public
roads, overhead and buried utilities are
commonly present that has led to substantial
subsurface disturbance within the publicly
maintained road ROW. The most significant
subsurface disturbances are associated with
buried utilities, including petroleum
pipelines, which parallel and frequently
cross the IIIC corridor.

Throughout the IIIC alignment, cultural
materials were identified on the ground
surface or within plow zones of agricultural
fields (i.e., 41ED268, 41FR92, 41FR95, and
41ZV496). Artifacts were occasionally,
encountered on sites as deep as 60–120
cmbs (i.e., 41FR70, 41FR94, 41ZV485, and
41ZV491). In addition to archaeological
sites, investigators infrequently noted
isolated artifacts on the ground surface or
shallowly buried. These locations were
evaluated following the criteria for
archaeological site delineation and fewer
than three artifacts were found to be present.
These locations were documented as
“isolated finds” and will be further discussed
following the site discussions.

A typical shovel test in the southern half of
the IIIC alignment contained two strata and
terminated between 30–80 cmbs (Appendix
B). The upper stratum consisted of dark
grayish brown (10YR4/2) clay loam with
few chert gravels. The lower stratum usually
consisted of dry and compact, brown
(10YR5/3) clay to clay loam with one to
three percent calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
inclusions (increasing CaCO3 inclusions are
often interpreted as indicators of a basal
layer). Shovel tests in the northern half of
IIIC were increasingly shallow, typically
consisting of 10–30 cm of highly organic
stratum over limestone bedrock. A soil
profile of very dark grayish brown
(10YR3/2) silty loam with 20–50 percent
caliche/limestone
inclusions
is
representative of shovel tests in the northern
half of IIIC.

Several drainages along the IIIC alignment
exhibited deposits of sediment that
warranted deeper inspection. All prominent
drainages along the project alignment were
evaluated for the potential of containing
deep, alluvial deposits that may contain
intact cultural resources. For a variety of
reasons, the intersection of the IIIC
alignment and the Leona River, the Sand,
Cambalache, Turkey, Maverick, Chaparrosa,
Palo Blanco, Mula, Stricklin, Lindsey, Las
Mora, Pinto, East Fork Sycamore, Cow,
Sycamore, and Bluff creeks, as well as
Gallina Slough, Buck Hollow, Maurice
Canyon, the Five Mile, Wittenburg, Buffalo,
Cusenbary, and Dunbar draws did not
contain deposits that warranted backhoe
trench investigation (Figure 5). Further,
select drainages did contain seemingly
deeper deposits that warranted trenching

Of the 1,483 shovel tests excavated, 218
were positive for cultural material
(Appendix B). Most of these positive shovel
tests are associated with archaeological sites
and a limited number correspond to isolated
finds. In the case of the latter, isolated finds

River.

(e.g., Elm Creek) that would have been
evaluated with mechanical investigation.
However, the areas containing deeper
deposits are to be avoided via HDD, which
made deeper investigation in these areas
unnecessary.

The predominance of the western floodplain
at this crossing is composed of what appears
to be the T2 terrace with a narrow (~30 m)
T1 landform aligning drainage. The T1 tread
on the west bank is about 6 m above the
waterway and severely eroded (i.e., gullied).
The riser for the adjoining T2 terrace steeply
grades to the tread, which is roughly 10 m
above the Nueces River. No backhoe trench
investigations were conducted on the
western floodplain due to the eroded and
undulatory nature of the T1 landform.

The Nueces River, Frio River, and the
Todos Santos Creek crossings did exhibit
deep, intact deposits and were examined by
backhoe trench excavation (Figure 6).
Twenty-seven backhoe trenches were
utilized in IIIC to investigate these settings
with deeper, alluvial deposits (Appendix C).
Differing stratigraphy was encountered at
each of the backhoe trench investigation
areas. The predominance of these
investigations (n=20) were placed along the
Todos Santos Creek terrace while four were
excavated at the Nueces River, and three
were excavated along the Frio River.
Column sampling was selectively conducted
on several of these backhoe trenches. This
sampling was utilized when in proximity to
a previously recorded site, when cultural
materials were observed during the
pedestrian survey, or when possible cultural
materials were observed in the trench
profile.

In contrast, the eastern floodplain (left bank)
is predominantly composed of the seemingly
T1 terrace. All four backhoe trenches (NU1–
NU4) occurred on the tread of the T1
terrace, which gradually sloped upward and
away from the drainage. The investigations
on the eastern side (trenches NU1–NU4)
extended roughly 0.6 km (0.37 miles). All of
the Nueces River deposits appeared to be
alluvial in origin and had a similar
stratigraphy (Appendix C). The deposits on
the eastern side of the river exhibited
successive horizons of gradually lighter
colored silt loam deposits extending to 140–
310 cmbs (Figure 7). The presence of
CaCO3 filaments (5 percent) began at
roughly 50 cmbs and increase in frequency
and size with depth. These deposits suggest
an alluvial origin followed by an
uninterrupted pedogenic cycle. Simply put,
once the sediment was deposited in this area,
no obvious erosion or subsequent
aggradational event was apparent to visual
(macro-level) inspection. Finally, no cultural
materials were observed in the excavations
on the eastern side of the Nueces River.

NUECES RIVER
The proposed IIIC alignment crosses the
Nueces River southeast of La Pryor, Texas
in Zavala County (Appendix A.85). In this
area the Nueces River is meandering with a
very high sinuosity ratio of 2.8 (Charlton
2008:138–139). This indicates a dynamic
depositional history where the channel in
this area has moved laterally (Appendix
A.85). In this type of setting, the lateral
movement can significantly erode the
deposits of outside meander bends and, in
contrast, deposit significant amounts of
sediment upon interior meanders (Charlton
2008). Notably, the western side of the
floodplain is situated on an outside meander
43

uninterrupted pedogenic cycle. Only one
chert flake was observed on the western
floodplain in Frio2 at 63 cmbs. This chert
fragment could not be definitively assigned
to a cultural origin and coupled with the
vertical cracking in the stratum; it was not
interpreted to be associated with a
prehistoric site.

FRIO RIVER
The Frio River crossing is located near the
far southern end of the IIIC project
alignment in Frio County (Appendix A.106).
In this area the Frio River is categorized as
sinuous with a sinuosity ratio of 1.2
(Charlton 2008:138–139). Also, this
drainage valley is braided in that it parallels
and intersects several waterways including
Buck and Live Oak Creeks and several
intermittent drainages. Some conditions
attributed to this type of setting include high
stream power, a highly variable discharge,
and erodible banks (Charlton 2008:145).
The Frio River is perennial with a channel
that is 5 m (16 feet) wide with a base of fine
sand and silt clast materials and abundant
driftwood detritus ranging from branches to
medium 30 cm (12 inches) diameter trees.
This type of setting and its flotsam suggests
a dynamic history with lateral movement of
the channel and sporadic, “flashy” deposits.

The eastern floodplain (left bank) is
predominantly composed of the seemingly
T2 terrace with a narrow (~25 m) T1
landform aligning the drainage. The T2
tread on the east bank is about 6 m above the
waterway and very gradually slopes upward
and away from the channel. One backhoe
trench (Frio1) was placed on the tread of the
T2 landform, which encountered a disturbed
(plow zone) surface horizon underlain by
successive horizons of gradually lighter
colored silt loam strata extending to 160+
cmbs (Figure 8). The presence of CaCO3
filaments (~5 percent) began at roughly 40
cmbs and increased in frequency and size
with depth. As with the stratigraphy
observed on the western floodplain, these
deposits suggest an alluvial origin followed
by an uninterrupted pedogenic cycle.
However, based upon the prevalence and
size of CaCO3 filaments and small nodules,
the T2 stratigraphy beginning at 40 cmbs
appears older (Figure 8). Notably, cultural
materials were observed at the surface and
within Frio1 (Appendix C). Within the
trench, these artifacts (chert debitage and
FCR) were observed at or near the plow
zone. These cultural materials were recorded
as an archaeological site (i.e., 41FR92). This
site is discussed in more detail in the
41FR92 site summary below.

The predominance of the western floodplain
(right bank) at this crossing is composed of
what appears to be the T1 terrace with an
undulating and eroded tread from several
intermittent waterways. The gullied T1 tread
on the west bank is about 3–4 m above the
waterway. Two backhoe trenches (Frio2 and
Frio3) were excavated on the tread of the T1
landform
(Appendix
A.106).
The
investigations on the western side extended
roughly 0.3 km (980 feet) away from the
channel. These excavations contained a
surface horizon that had been disturbed by
plowing to a depth of roughly 40 cmbs
(Appendix C). Underlying the disturbed
plow zone were successive horizons of
gradually lighter colored clay loam deposits
extending to 140+ cmbs. The presence of
CaCO3 filaments (5 percent) began at
roughly 40 cmbs and increase in frequency
and size with depth. These deposits suggest
an alluvial origin followed by an

TODOS SANTOS CREEK
The IIIC alignment does cross the Todos
Santos Creek, but at that crossing the
drainage does not contain deep deposits
warranting mechanical investigation and

and some recent disturbance is present.
However, the IIIC alignment closely
parallels the Todos Santos Creek for about
2.5 miles. This location is situated at the
southern end of the IIIC project alignment,
roughly 7.5 miles west of the Frio River
crossing in Frio County (Appendix A.102–
103). At this location, the Todos Santo
Creek has a sinuosity ratio of 1.18 and
classified as sinuous (Charlton 2008:138–
139). The drainage is intermittent with a
channel that is 12–15 feet (3.6–4.5 m) wide
and exhibits a base of fine sand and silt clast
materials. The drainage valley exhibits a
paired terrace system that from youngest to
oldest include the T0 and T1 terraces (Waters
1992:149–152). The T0 landform is limited
to the base of the channel and extremely
undulatory from recent earth movement (i.e.,
disturbed). The T1 tread is about 1.5 m (5
feet) above the base of the Todos Santos
Creek drainage. This T1 landform gradually
slopes up and away from the drainage at a
slight angle until encountering the base of
the upland slope.

contexts of the broad site. The site
depositional context in select areas was
found to be conducive to good or excellent
preservation of archaeological components.
Within these intact deposits, a wellpreserved Middle to Transitional Archaic
and Late Prehistoric assemblage with
discernible spatial and temporal patterns was
recovered. In contrast, with the project
corridor, the predominance of the cultural
deposits (i.e., Toeslope and Upland
stratigraphies) on the Turkey Terrace site is
extremely fragmented and determined to be
of compromised integrity. The cultural
deposits in these areas range from the
surface to 50 cmbs and contain intermixed
Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts. As
will be discussed in the 41FR70 site
summary below and is detailed in the report
regarding the significance testing of this site,
the intact portions of 41FR70 will be
avoided via horizontal directional drill
(Lawrence et al. 2012). Therefore, no
portions of 41FR70 on the terrace of the
Todos Santos Creek that are considered
significant will be impacted by the proposed
IIIC project.

The proposed IIIC project alignment crosses
the northern terrace (left bank) of the Todos
Santos Creek along the T1 tread and foot
slopes of the nearby uplands (Appendix
A.102–103). A series of 20 backhoe
trenches (BHT1–20) were excavated along
this terrace and the surrounding area to
investigate the stratigraphy and conduct
archaeological significance testing for site
41FR70 (Turkey Terrace Site). This site, a
multi-component prehistoric campsite, was
discovered during the pedestrian survey of
the area and is discussed in more detail
below and in the report regarding the
significance testing of this site (Lawrence et
al. 2012).

Overall, the investigations in IIIC identified
44 new archaeological sites (41ED465–
41ED471, 41FR70–41FR72, 41FR90–41FR96, 41KY158, 41KY159, 41KY172–
175, 41MV367–41MV371, 41ZV461–
41ZV463, and 41ZV485–41ZV497) and
reevaluated seven previously recorded sites
(41ED14, 41KY160, 41ZV96, 41ZV181,
41ZV443, 41ZV455 and 41ZV459; Table
2). Four sites (41FR70, 41FR94, 41KY158,
and 41ZV485) exhibited a significant
amount of cultural material either on the
surface or in an undisturbed buried context
and were therefore recommended for further
investigation to assess the sites’ NRHP
eligibility potential. Site specifics are
discussed further below, but briefly, DCP
opted to avoid sites 41FR94, 41KY158, and

41ZV485 via horizontal directional drill
(HDD). Accordingly, these sites will not be
affected by the current IIIC alignment. Site
41FR70 was investigated by means of
mechanical trenching and hand excavated
test units, which identified potentially
significant portions of the site (Lawrence et
al. 2012). These portions of 41FR70 will be
avoided via HDD, and accordingly,
significant portions of site 41FR70 will not
be affected by the current IIIC alignment.
All sites encountered during the IIIC
archaeological investigation are discussed in
further detail below.

SUMMARY

Site 41ED14 is a small prehistoric lithic
scatter that remains essentially unchanged
since it was originally documented in 1983.
Investigators noted a total of 13 artifacts on
the ground surface, none of which were
temporally diagnostic. No cultural features
are present and no burned rock was noted.
The area is heavily impacted by sheet
erosion and two shovel tests encountered
bedrock just beneath the surface.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES

The lack of intact, buried deposits or cultural
features in an eroded area leaves little to no
potential for the site to yield information
important to the prehistory of the region.
Due to its limited research value, SWCA
does not recommend site 41ED14 as eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP and no further
investigations or avoidance are warranted
for the site.

41ED14
Site 41ED14 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
that was first identified by TxDOT in 1983
(Atlas 2012). Previous records indicate three
flakes within a 75 m-diameter area on a
rocky upland stream margin; approximately
100 m southeast of Highway 377 within
HPA 3CMS37 (Appendix A.32–33).

41ED265 (MS17)

Vegetation consists of patchy juniper trees,
short, thin grasses, and prickly pear cactus.
Overall surface visibility is approximately
80 percent. Soil on the site consists of dark
brown loam over solid limestone bedrock at
5–10 cmbs, within an area that has been
scoured by sheet erosion. The 75 mdiameter site boundary is unchanged by the
current investigation, based on pedestrian
inspection and shovel test results.

Site 41ED265 is an open campsite with
Early Archaic dart point fragments and three
middens located in west–central Edwards
County within HPA 3CMS26 (Appendix
A.27). The site is situated on the eastern
edge of a hilltop overlooking Wittenburg
Draw, approximately 100 m to the east
(Figure 9). The general area is characterized
by rugged, limestone side slopes and incised
drainages.

Two shovel tests (TS109 and TS110) were
excavated in the site area, both of which
were negative for cultural material
(Appendix B). Investigators observed a total
of three biface tools and 10 flakes on the
surface within the previously recorded
boundary. The artifacts identified on the
surface are consistent with those recorded in

Exposed bedrock is prevalent across much
of the site area, with shallow pockets of soil
present in eroded depressions. Vegetation
consists of sporadic clusters of juniper trees,
prickly pear cacti, and short, patchy grass.
Approximately 80 percent of the surface was
visible at the time of survey. Where present,
soil consists of a dark and highly organic

Baker, or Martindale types; all of which are
indicative of Early Archaic activity. A
surface inspection was conducted beyond
the survey corridor to define the site
boundaries, however, no shovel tests were
excavated beyond the ROW limit.

Site 41ED265 was identified on the surface,
where lithic debitage and burned rock was
very dense and localized. Most significantly,
three burned rock middens were identified.
The largest, Midden 1, is located on the
fairly level hilltop, about 50 m east of the
ROW (Figure 10). This roughly donutshaped midden is mounded about 1.5 m high
and is cut by a shallow drainage channel,
causing a depression through the middle of
the feature. The midden is approximately 25
m in diameter. An extensive looter's pile of
about 100 tool fragments was found just
north of this midden.

The site area measures approximately 200 m
diameter based upon surface artifact
distribution. A cleared corridor parallels a
barbed wire fenceline through the site and
the proposed ROW and has impacted
cultural material in this area. Artifact
collection is evident, as two piles of broken
tool fragments were encountered near two of
the three middens, which makes it likely that
additional diagnostic artifacts were taken
from the site. Remaining artifacts have been
intentionally relocated from their primary
context.
SUMMARY

The second, Midden 2, is located another 50
m to the east of Midden 1. This midden is
much smaller (approximately 8 m diameter)
and consists of about 50 cm of mounded
burned rock on the edge of another small
drainage channel. Again, a looter's pile was
found on the north edge of this midden. The
third midden (Midden 3) is located 25 m
east of Midden 2 and is situated on the edge
of the hilltop. This mound is roughly
circular, about 10 m diameter, and 1.5 m
high. None of the middens appear to be
disturbed by the surface collection and there
is no soil surrounding them. All three of the
middens are well beyond the ROW limits
and no features were identified within the
survey corridor.

Site 41ED265 is a prehistoric campsite
consisting of three burned rock middens and
a dense surface scatter of lithic tools and
debitage. Clearing activity has partially
disturbed the site, but moreover, artifact
collection is evident and most of the tools
encountered had been relocated from their
primary context prior to the current survey.
Diagnostic dart points indicate activity
during the Early Archaic period, however,
the surficial context may represent
additional, mixed cultural deposits.
The three midden features represent the
main site component and, as they are all
located beyond the survey corridor and have
not been thoroughly investigated, the site is
of undetermined NRHP eligibility. The lack
of soil or cultural features within the project
area leaves little to no potential to yield
information important to the prehistory of
the region, and as such the portion of site
41ED265 within the current ROW is not
considered a contributing element to the

Artifacts include four rough dart point
fragments, cores, core scrapers, nondiagnostic biface fragments, lithic debitage,
and burned rock. Although the dart points
were highly fractured, two resemble Uvalde
dart points and others appear to be Bandy,

fragment, two bifacial tool fragments, one
drill, approximately 200 tertiary flakes, 50
primary flakes, and a small amount of
burned rock. A total of six shovel tests
(DA131, DA132, SW105, SW106, TS111,
and TS112) were excavated in the site area,
two of which (SW105 and SW106) were
positive for cultural material (Appendix B).
Buried material was found within
secondarily deposited slopewash with a high

overall site potential. Due to its limited
research value within the project area, no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the portion of site 41ED265
that extends into the current ROW. If future
construction activity is to impact the midden
area, to the east of the current ROW, further
investigation of the midden composition is
recommended.
41ED266 (MS20)
Site 41ED266 is a prehistoric open campsite
located in southwestern Edwards County
within HPA 3CMS37 (Appendix A.33). The
site is situated primarily on the southeastern
side of a broad and rocky unnamed drainage,
with some cultural material also identified
on a low rise to the northwest of the channel
(Appendix A.33). Within the ROW, two
smaller channels converge within a
generally gravelly landscape that has been
scoured by rapid floodwaters.

SUMMARY

Site 41ED266 is a prehistoric open camp
consisting of surficial and shallowly buried
cultural material found on the banks of an
ephemeral upland drainage. The artifact
assemblage consists primarily of lithic
debitage, with a few non-diagnostic bifacial
tools and burned rock fragments. No cultural
features or diagnostic artifacts were
identified and the site is located in an area
with little to no soil.

Vegetation in the site area consists of
juniper trees, prickly pear cacti, and sparse
grass. Overall surface visibility is
approximately 60–80 percent across the site.
Where present, the soil is very shallow and
consists of dark brown to black gravelly
loam. Shovel tests were terminated at
limestone bedrock at depths of 5–25 cmbs.

The lack of buried cultural material, cultural
features, or temporally diagnostic artifacts
leaves little to no potential for the site to
yield information important to the prehistory
of the region. Due to its limited research
value, SWCA does not recommend site
41ED266 as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.

The site area is approximately 50 m
northeast–southwest by 170 m northwest–
southeast based upon pedestrian inspection
and shovel test results. A transmission line
and two-track access road traverse the east
side of the site along the base of the rocky
upland drainage margin, however, the
primary impact to the site area is erosion
from frequent flood events.

material found to a maximum depth of 10
cmbs.
Vegetation consists of mesquite, acacia,
cacti, and patchy grass, which afforded
approximately 70–90 percent visibility
across the rocky surface at the time of
survey. Where present, soil on the site
consists of 5–15 cm of gravelly loam over
limestone bedrock.

41ED268 (MS23)
The site area measures 150 m west–east by
30 m north–south based upon surface
artifact distribution, shovel test results, and
the extent of the survey corridor.
Disturbance on the site is attributed to a twotrack roadway, a water tank (located in the
northeast portion of the site), clearing
activity and surface erosion.

Site 41ED268 is a multiple component site
located in western central Edwards County
within HPA 3CMS47 (Appendix A.24). The
site is situated immediately north of
Highway 377 on an interfluve landform
dissected by multiple small drainages that
feed into Wittenburg Draw (Figure 11).
Vegetation consists of sparse live oak and
juvenile mesquite trees and patchy grass. At
the time of survey, approximately 80 percent
of the ground surface was visible. The
ground surface is very rocky with abundant
chert cobbles across the generally flat and
open interfluvial landform. The main
drainage through the area is located to the
north of the site and is incised
approximately 2 m into limestone bedrock.
Other minor channels are little more than
shallow depressions that meander across the
landscape. Soil across the site consists of
dark yellowish to reddish brown silty loam
that terminated at bedrock in all shovel tests
at depths no greater than 35 cmbs.

Site 41ED267 was identified during the
centerline survey through pedestrian
inspection of the ground surface. Artifacts
consist primarily of lithic debitage, while
some core tools were encountered in the
southwestern portion of the site. The
identified tools all consist of utilized cores.
A total of four shovel tests (TN142, TN143,
TS325, and TS326) were excavated
(Appendix B). Of these, one (TN142) was
positive for lithic debitage within the upper
10 cmbs. Buried cultural material consisted
of four flakes and three pieces of
indeterminate chert shatter. Bedrock was
encountered in this shovel test at a depth of
15 cmbs. No cultural features or late stage
bifacial tools were encountered on the site.

The site spans approximately 55 m
northeast–southwest by 800 m northwest–
southeast based upon surface artifact
distribution and the project area boundary.
The area is cleared of dense vegetation and
utilized for sheep grazing. Due to the

SUMMARY

Site 41ED267 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
and quarry site with a surficial assemblage
of lithic debitage and cores. No diagnostic
artifacts were encountered and all artifacts
were confined to the ground surface or the
upper 10 cm of sediment.

shallow nature of soils and the surficial
cultural material, clearing activity along
with natural erosion has greatly impacted the
integrity of the site. Site 41ED268 was
identified entirely on the ground surface
during the centerline survey. Artifacts
include low numbers of chert cores, utilized
flakes,
biface
fragments,
scrapers,
manganese
bleached
glass,
and
indeterminate metal fragments, two horse
shoes, several metal barrel straps, and one
green glazed earthenware fragment. A total
of 10 shovel tests (DR193–DR195, KL13–
KL16, and TS210–212) were excavated,
none of which were positive for cultural
material (Appendix B). No cultural features
were identified within the site area.

41ED269 (MS28)
Site 41ED269 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
located in southwestern Edwards County
within HPA 3CMS72 (Appendix A.36). The
site is situated on a flat terrace that slopes
gently to the north into an unnamed
Sycamore Creek drainage channel. The FM
2523 ROW fenceline is located immediately
east of the southern portion of the site.
Vegetation consists of juniper and mesquite
trees, acacia, prickly pear, and pencil cacti.
The overall surface visibility at the time of
survey was approximately 50–75 percent.
The ground surface is gravelly, with the
percentage of gravels increasing to the south
with elevation. The soil consists of silty clay
over limestone bedrock at a depth of 5–45
cmbs.

Due to the presence of natural chert cobbles
and early stage reduction debitage, the
prehistoric artifact assemblage is typical of
quarry sites and exhibits no attributes of
long-term or seasonally occupied habitation
sites. The historic artifact scatter is also
typical of material associated with 20th
century
agricultural
complexes.
No
prehistoric features or historic structural
remnants are present within the project area
and no temporally discreet diagnostic
artifacts were encountered.

The site spans approximately 250 m north–
south by 30 m east–west based upon surface
artifact distribution and shovel test results.
The surface is heavily eroded and road
construction has further impacted the
southern end of the site.

SUMMARY

Site 41ED269 was identified strictly on the
ground surface during the centerline survey.
Artifacts include lithic debitage and a single
bifacial tool fragment. The tool is well
thinned and exhibits fine pressure flaking
along a single lateral edge. No diagnostic
tools were encountered. A total of six shovel
tests (DR287, DR288, TN137, TN138,
TS317, and TS318) were excavated, none of
which were positive for cultural material
(Appendix B). No cultural features or
concentrations of cultural material were
identified within the site area. Investigations
were therefore limited to the proposed ROW

Site 41ED268 is a large and diffuse site
comprised of prehistoric quarry and historic
agricultural components. Historic debris is
typical of early to mid-20th century
agricultural scatters, however, no temporally
discreet diagnostic artifacts or cultural
features were encountered within the project
area.

and the site boundary was defined within the
project area.
SUMMARY

Site 41ED269 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
with shallow, gravelly soil, no buried
cultural materials, and no identified cultural
features within the ROW. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts were encountered.

SUMMARY

Site 41ED270 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
with shallow, gravelly soil, no identified
cultural features, and no buried cultural
material. No diagnostic artifacts were
encountered and the site is of unknown
antiquity.

The lack of intact deposits or cultural
features leaves little to no potential for the
site to yield new or beneficial information to
the prehistory of the region. Due to its
limited research value, SWCA does not
recommend site 41ED269 as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and no further
investigations or avoidance are warranted
for the site.

The paucity of cultural material and lack of
cultural features leaves little to no potential

41ED270 (MS31)
Site 41ED270 is a sparse lithic scatter
located in northwestern Edwards County
within HPA 3CMS81 (Appendix A.16). The
site is situated on the south edge of an
unnamed Buffalo Draw tributary drainage.
The area is very rocky with shallow soil and
frequent exposures of limestone bedrock.

41ED271 (MS32)
Site 41ED271 is a large quarry area
encompassing two small campsites near the
edge of ephemeral drainages. The site is
located in northwestern Edwards County
within HPA 3CMS82 (Appendix A.19). The
site is located on the northeast end of a low
rolling hill, with most cultural material
found between two drainages, but also
extending to the southeast of the larger
streambed (Figure 12). Cultural deposits
were encountered to a depth of 40 cmbs in
the southeast portion of the site. Beyond
this, the elevation begins to rise gently on a
low, rocky toe slope.

Vegetation consists of live oak and cedar
trees, prickly pear cacti, and short patchy
grass. The overall surface visibility at the
time of survey was approximately 5–50
percent. The ground surface is rocky with
equal areas of shallow loamy soil and
exposed limestone bedrock. Where soil is
present, limestone bedrock is buried beneath
approximately 10–35 cm of silty loam.
Site 41ED270 is completely surficial. Two
shovel tests (MP11 and MS14) were
excavated but both were negative for
cultural material and encountered shallowly
buried bedrock (Appendix B). Artifacts

of the site and approximately one artifact per
10 m2 elsewhere. This suggests a more
intensive utilization of the stream margin for
lithic reduction, tool production, and
cooking/ heating activities whereas the
rocky slopes that comprise most of the site
were utilized as a quarry site; based on the
presence of large primary flakes and cores.

The site spans approximately 600 m
northwest–southeast by 50 m northeast–
southwest based upon surface artifact
distribution and shovel test results. Soil on
the site consists of a very dark grayish
brown silty loam over limestone bedrock at
a maximum depth of 45 cmbs. Typically,
bedrock was encountered at approximately
10–15 cmbs.

SUMMARY

Site 41ED271 is a prehistoric lithic quarry
and open campsite consisting of tools, lithic
debitage, and burned rock in a rocky,
undulating landscape. One Uvalde-like dart
point fragment was observed on the surface
indicating an association with the Early
Archaic period. Limestone bedrock was
encountered at a shallow depth across the
site and very little buried cultural material
was present.

Site 41ED271 is primarily surficial in
nature, with a limited number of artifacts
coming from a buried context. Artifacts
include one Early Archaic dart point
fragment, lithic debitage, burned rock,
modified flakes, cores, and a few nondiagnostic bifacial tools. The dart point
fragment consists of most of the stem and
body (excluding portions of the base,
shoulders, and tip), and resembles the
Uvalde point type. Pedestrian survey
focused on the proposed ROW and the
adjacent area and no shovel tests were
excavated beyond the ROW limit.

The absence of cultural features and paucity
of buried cultural material in an eroded
context leaves little to no potential for the
site to yield additional information regarding
the prehistory of the region. Due to its
limited research value, SWCA does not
recommend site 41ED271 as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and no further
investigations or avoidance are warranted
for the site.
41FR70 (TN5& 11, MS12)

A total of 10 shovel tests (MP15–MP20 and
TN189–192) were excavated, two of which
(MP18 and TN192) were positive for
cultural material (Appendix B). Buried
artifacts consist of three burned rock
fragments at 5–10 cmbs in shovel test MP18
and one flake at 40 cmbs in shovel test
TN192. Surface artifacts were denser in this
area, including an increase in the amount of
burned rock and tertiary debitage.
Specifically, there were approximately 25

During the survey of the Phase IIIC
alignment of the Sand Hills Pipeline project,
SWCA encountered archaeological site
41FR70 in southwest Frio County within
HPAs 3CMS13, 3CTN3, 3CTN5–R, and
3CTN9 (Figure 14; Appendix A.102–103).

within the upper 20–50 cmbs (Appendix B).

deposits
associated
with
Middle–
Transitional Archaic to Late Prehistoric
occupations. The site is located east and
west of CR 4440, paralleling the Todos
Santos Creek. Roughly 28 percent of
41FR70 is located west of the road while the
remaining 78 percent is east of CR 4440
(Appendix A.102–103). The site drapes the
north floodplain (left bank) and first terrace
of the drainage and footslopes of the
adjacent uplands. The current site boundary
encompasses
an
area
measuring
approximately 2,650 m northwest–southeast
by 650 m northeast–southwest; however it is
highly likely that the site extends beyond the
currently accessible survey area.

The surface assemblage in the eastern
portion of the site consists of lithic debitage
and shatter, sparsely scattered burned rock,
cores, chipped stone tool fragments, and two
Tortugas projectile points. Artifacts were
diffusely spread across the eastern portion of
the site with no areas of increased density.
Within the 35 positive shovel tests, the
assemblage includes lithic debitage, tested
cobbles, scattered fire-cracked rock, a Late
Archaic Desmuke dart point (TN43), and
one edge modified tool (TN48) that is very
similar in appearance to the Desmuke dart
point.

SWCA’s initial investigations consisted of
intensive surface inspection with shovel
testing (n=90) across 41FR70. Due to the
large size of the Turkey Terrace site and for
purposes of investigation and organization,
the site discussion is broken into west and
east, as divided by a large ranch road
aligned roughly north–south (Appendix
A.102–103). The western half of the site
extends approximately 1,550 m west of this
ranch road while the eastern half extends
about 1,100 m eastward. SWCA initially
documented the site through intensive
surface inspection with shovel testing
(n=90).

In the western portion of the site, land
access was granted beyond the survey
corridor thus allowing for more expansive
site delineation efforts. A total of 48 shovel
tests (CS54–CS65, PB73–PB86, TN20–
TN26, and WV83–97) were excavated
across this portion of the site, 35 of which
were positive for cultural material (CS54–
CS56, CS61, CS62, CS64, CS65, PB73,
PB74, PB77–PB86, TN21, TN22, TN24–
TN26, and WV83–WV86, WV88, WV91–
WV93, and WV95–97; Appendix B). The
majority of buried cultural material was
recovered between 0–40 cmbs, however, a
few shovel tests encountered cultural
material to a depth of 120 cmbs. Within the
35 positive shovel tests, the assemblage
includes lithic debitage, scattered firecracked rock, thermal shatter, and burned
clay nodules (Appendix B). Three potential
burned rock hearth features were identified
in shovel tests (PB85, WV85, and CS55), as
well as associated thermal shatter, burned
clay, red ochre, and sparse charcoal. The
surface assemblage observed in the western

Within the eastern portion of 41FR70, 42

with select pockets of integrity. The
predominance of the observed deposits in
the 90-foot project corridor are shallowly
buried older deposits with Uvalde gravels
and/or caliche with some evidence of recent
disturbance (i.e., vegetation clearing). These
deposits are interpreted to be derived from a
combination of alluvial and colluvial
deposition. The colluvial deposits (i.e., slope
wash) are associated with the Upland and
Toeslope stratigraphies while alluvial
deposition is associated with the Lowland
stratigraphy areas closer to the Todos Santos
Creek drainage and some Toeslope areas.
Accordingly, the most intact profiles
observed at the Todos Santos Creek and
41FR70 are within the Lowland stratigraphy
areas (Appendix C). The excavations in
these areas (BHTs 2, 6, and 9) appear to be
capped by a strong brown (7.5YR5/6 and
7.5YR5/8) fine sandy loam deposited
sometime within the last 300 years or so
(Figure 15). This interpretation is based
upon the temporally diagnostic Perdiz
projectile point recovered from the
underlying horizon (i.e., Strat IIIa). Where
present, this surface horizon varied in
thickness, but effectively capped the
prehistoric deposits buffering them from
man-made disturbances and erosion. This
capped stratigraphy is most prevalent west
of CR 4440 (Appendix A.102–103).

portion of the site includes lithic debitage
and shatter with no predominant stages
observed, chipped stone tools, mussel shell,
and scattered burned rock. Additionally, a
Late to Transitional Archaic Marcos dart
point and an untyped projectile point
fragment were observed in areas of high
ground surface visibility. In general, the
density of artifacts, both surface and
subsurface, appeared to be highest in the
region immediately west of CR 4440.
Based upon the presence of relatively dense
buried cultural deposits, diagnostic artifacts,
potential buried and intact features, and the
abundance and variety of recovered artifacts,
SWCA considered site 41FR70 to have the
potential to yield new and unique
information regarding prehistoric activity in
the region. As survey level investigations
were insufficient to adequately assess the
nature and significance of the deposits,
SWCA recommended avoidance or further
investigation to determine the NRHP
eligibility status of site 41FR70.
Between March and April 2012, SWCA
conducted
archaeological
significance
testing at 41FR70 (Lawrence et al. 2012).
These investigations utilized 20 BHTs and
34 1x1-m test units, comprising a total of 19
m3 of hand excavated sediment (Figure 14).
The mechanical trenching investigations at
the Todos Santos Creek and 41FR70
encountered a variety of profiles depending
upon proximity to the drainage. In all, the
excavated profiles revealed three types of
stratigraphy that include a Lowland
stratigraphy situated adjacent to the
drainage, a Toe slope stratigraphy within
excavations generally midway between the
drainage and uplands, and an Upland
stratigraphy (Lawrence et al. 2012).

In contrast, the deposits within the Upland
and most Toeslope settings appear to have a
reduced contributing sediment budget,
which affected the cultural deposits
differently from the Lowland stratigraphy
areas. Specifically, the cultural deposits in
the Upland and Toeslope stratigraphy areas
were not separated by any substantial
aggradation, thus creating more of a
palimpsest
with
mixed
temporal
components. This is particularly evident
with the Late Prehistoric occupations
discussed in more detail below. Similarly,

The stratigraphy observed at the Todos

the cultural materials within the Upland and
Toeslope stratigraphies are at the ground
surface or shallowly buried (up to 40–50
cmbs) due to the reduced deposition. As a
consequence, the prehistoric deposits in
these areas were more susceptible to
disturbance and erosion.

Vegetation consists of bunch grasses,
mesquite and prickly pear cacti. Surface
visibility is high, roughly 50–75 percent
across the site. The soils observed varied
with topography, with alluvial sandy clay
loam in the floodplain, and fine sandy loams
over very dark grayish brown mottled sandy
clays with CaCO3 nodules throughout the
rest of the site. Impacts to the site include
heavy land clearing for hunting, ranching,
two-track roads and fencing. The site spans
approximately 1,650 m east to west by 60 m
north to south based upon surface artifact
distribution and positive shovel tests within
the surveyed corridors.

SUMMARY

Site 41FR70 is a prehistoric open campsite
and procurement area composed of a
broadly dispersed scatter of surficial
artifacts, and substantial subsurface cultural
deposits
associated
with
Middle–
Transitional Archaic to Late Prehistoric
occupations. Based upon the full suite of
investigations conducted by SWCA at the
site, the areas exhibiting the Lowland
stratigraphy are considered eligible for
listing on the NRHP under Criterion D.
Those areas exhibiting Toeslope and Upland
stratigraphies are not considered significant
nor do they contribute to the site’s
eligibility. Accordingly, the majority of site
41FR70 within the Sand Hills Phase IIIC
Pipeline corridor is disturbed with poor
contextual integrity while a small portion of
the site about 575 m (1,890 feet) in length
contains intact, significant stratified
deposits. Only the portion of 41FR70
considered eligible to the NRHP is
recommended for avoidance via HDD (i.e.,
boring) or rerouting measures. SWCA
recommends no further archaeological
investigations or avoidance measures within
the portions of the site containing Toeslope
and Upland stratigraphies (Figure 14). See
Lawrence and others (2012) report for a full
discussion of the significance testing results
and recommendations for site 41FR70.

Site 41FR71 was identified during the
centerline survey when a variety of
prehistoric and historic artifacts were
observed on the surface. The prehistoric
assemblage consists of lithic debitage
(N=30+), 10 bifand scattered burned rock.
Additionally, a Late to Transitional Archaic
Marcos dart point and an untyped projectile
point fragment were observed in areas of
high ground surface visibility. In general,
the density of artifacts, both surface and
subsurface, appeared to be highest in the
region immediately west of CR 4440.
Based upon the presence of relatively dense
buried cultural deposits, diagnostic artifacts,
potential buried and intact features, and the
abundance and variety of recovered artifacts,
SWCA considered site 41FR70 to have
theaces, two dart point preforms, one
Montell dart point, one untyped point, one
modified flake, and sparse burned rock
fragments. The presence of a Montell dart
point suggests a Transitional to Late Archaic
occupation (Figure 16; Turner et al. 2011).

fragment. Four historic features were also
encountered including a small stock tank on
a concrete foundation with wooden posts
(Feature 1), an Aero-Motor windmill
(Feature 2), a large stock tank (Feature 3)
and a metal tank with metal and wood
fencing (Feature 4). The historic component
was determined to be outside of the survey
corridor after a centerline shift 100 m to the
north and thus will no longer be affected by
the current centerline alignment.

Due to the disturbed and fragmentary nature
of 41FR71 from heavy land clearing for
hunting, ranching, two-track roads and
fences, neither component of the site is
likely to yield any new or unique
information to the region. Based on these
factors, the lack of depositional integrity and
the lack of research potential, SWCA does
not recommend 41FR71 as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and no further
investigations or avoidance are warranted
for the site.

A thorough inspection to identify the extent
of the site was conducted within the HPA
and survey corridor limits. A total of 38
shovel tests (CG110–112, CS49–CS53,
CS71, CS72, MC113, MS114, PB63–PB72,
PB92, PB93, TN30, SS15–SS17, WV74–
WV82, WV103, and WV104) were
excavated, of which 14 (CS49, MC113,
MS114, PB64, PB66, PB68, PB71, PB92,
PB93, TN30, WV74, WV78, WV71 and
WV104) were positive for cultural material
(Appendix B). The majority of subsurface
materials were observed from 0–20 cmbs,
however one shovel test (WV104)
encountered cultural materials as deep as 50
cmbs.

41FR72 (TN3)
Site 41FR72 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
located in southwest Frio County within
HPA 3CTN1. The site is situated in a
relatively flat floodplain of the Leona River,
which is located approximately 490 m to the
east (Appendix A.105). A large wetland is
located between the east edge of the site and
the river. The dominant vegetation across
the site includes mesquite trees with a short
grass and bramble understory, allowing for
40 percent surface visibility. Soils
throughout the site consist of yellowishbrown to brown silty clay loam variably
overlying brownish-yellow sand and
reddish-yellow clay loam. Impacts to the site
include some land clearing for two-track
roads and a fenceline that bisects the site.

SUMMARY

Site 41FR71 is a multi-component site with
a Transitional to Late Archaic campsite an
unknown
historic
component.
The
prehistoric component, comprised of lithic
debitage, stone tools, and burned rock is
defined as a prehistoric campsite (Collins
2004). Overall, the prehistoric component is
sparse in quantity and diffusely scattered.

The site is roughly 30 m north–south by 100
m east–west, based on the distribution of
surface artifacts within designated HPA and
survey corridor limits. The site likely
continues outside of the limited survey area;

67

The site spans approximately 500 m north–
south by 560 m east–west based upon
surface artifact distribution and shovel test
results. Two two-track roads traverse the site
as well as one broad transmission line
corridor at the northeastern edge. The
artifact assemblage consists solely of lithic
debitage and burned rock.

however access restrictions prevented full
site boundary delineation.
Site 41FR72 was initially discovered during
pedestrian survey when approximately 150
chert and quartzite debitage, cultural shatter,
sparse (possible) burned rock, a core, a
modified flake and a biface were observed
between two dirt and gravel two-track roads.
Four shovel tests (CS2, CS3, PB3, and
WV3) were excavated (Appendix B). Only
one of these tests (WV3) was positive for
cultural material, consisting of two chert
flakes at a depth of 50 cmbs. No diagnostic
materials or cultural features were noted at
the site.

Site 41FR90 was identified primarily on the
ground surface, with some artifacts found
just below the surface in three shovel tests
(AC39, DA56, and MC48). Observed
artifacts include lithic debitage and burned
rock. A total of 14 shovel tests (AC38–
AC41, DA56–DA59, MC48–50, and TN50–
52) were excavated, three of which were
positive for cultural material to a maximum
depth of 30 cmbs (Appendix B). No cultural
features were identified within the site area
and
no
diagnostic
artifacts
were
encountered.

SUMMARY

Site 41FR72 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of
an unknown age. The site has been
moderately impacted by land clearing.
Within the survey corridor, the assemblage
is almost entirely surficial in nature and nondiagnostic, with little to no potential to yield
information important to the prehistory of
the region. Due to its limited research value,
SWCA does not recommend site 41FR72 as
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.

SUMMARY

Site 41FR90 is a defined as a prehistoric
open campsite based on the presence of
lithic debitage and burned rock (Collins
2004). No cultural features or diagnostic
artifacts were identified.
The lack of deeply buried deposits,
diagnostic artifacts, or cultural features
leaves little to no potential for the site to
yield information important to the prehistory
of the region. Due to its limited research
value, SWCA does not recommend site
41FR90 as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.

41FR90 (MS13)
Site 41FR90 is a prehistoric open campsite
located in southwestern Frio County within
HPA 3CMS22 (Appendix A.105). The site
is situated on a generally flat, low rise to the
east of the Leona River floodplain.
Vegetation consists of mesquite and cacti
and the overall surface visibility is
approximately 50 percent. The ground
surface has some rounded gravels and the
soil consists of clay loam which is sterile
and extremely compact at 40 cmbs.

41FR91 (MS14)
Site 41FR91 is a Late Prehistoric open
campsite located in western central Frio
County within HPA 3CMS23 (Appendix
A.104). The site is situated at the south edge
68

cmbs in shovel test TN61, suggesting some
level of disturbance. No cultural features
were identified within the site area.

of a grazing pasture largely on the west side
of a small Todos Santos Creek tributary
drainage. The shallow drainage has been
modified to create a cattle stock tank just
south of the project area.

The artifact assemblage primarily consists of
lithic debitage and burned rock, with a
single Perdiz arrow point base and a small
number of chert cores. The Perdiz arrow
point is indicative of a Late Prehistoric
presence (Turner et al. 2011). No other
diagnostic artifacts were encountered and no
cultural features were identified.

Vegetation consists of short, grazed grass
with mesquite trees following a fenceline
that parallels the southern ROW boundary.
Overall surface visibility is excellent, at
approximately 75–100 percent across the
site. The ground surface is gravelly, with
some larger stream-rolled chert and quartzite
cobbles. Soil consists of sandy loam over a
brownish red clay subsoil or bedrock at
depths ranging from 30–60 cmbs.

SUMMARY

Site 41FR91 is a prehistoric open campsite
with shallow, gravelly soil, no identified
cultural features, and very little buried
cultural material, which may be a result of
agricultural disturbance. A Prediz arrow
point base indicates activity during the Late
Prehistoric period.

The site area measures approximately 140 m
north–south by 460 m east–west based upon
surface artifact distribution and shovel test
results. Extensive surface disturbance is
evident due to clearing, fenceline and stock
tank construction, and a two-track road that
traverses the site roughly in the location of
the small drainage. Due to agricultural
modification, the drainage is hardly
perceptible within the project area.

The lack of intact deposits or cultural
features in a disturbed surface context leaves
little to no potential for the site to yield
information important to the prehistory of
the region. Due to its limited research value,
SWCA does not recommend site 41FR91 as
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.

Site 41FR91 was confined largely to the
ground surface with a few artifacts
recovered in shovel tests to a maximum
depth of 52 cmbs. Artifacts include one
Perdiz arrow point base, lithic debitage, a
few chert cores, and burned rock. A
thorough surface inspection was conducted
to identify the extent of the surface artifact
scatter beyond the survey corridor, however,
no shovel tests were excavated beyond the
ROW limit. A total of eight shovel tests
(DA66–DA68, MC58, MC59, TN59–TN61)
were excavated, six of which (DA66, MC58,
MC59, TN59–TN61) were positive for
cultural material (Appendix B). Buried
artifacts include 10 flakes and three pieces
of burned rock between 5–52 cmbs. Of note,
one piece of plastic was also recovered at 45

41FR92 (MS35)
Site 41FR92 is a prehistoric open campsite
located in southwest central Frio County
within HPA 3CMS86. The site is situated on
the high terrace to the east/northeast of the
Frio River within a plowed agricultural field
(Appendix A.105–106).
Vegetation is present at the terrace edge and
along the property fenceline, however, most
of the area had been recently plowed.
Surface visibility was greater than 75
percent across the site at the time of survey
69

SUMMARY

(Figure 17). The ground surface is loamy
with rare natural gravels. Soil consists of
approximately 46 cm of brown, sandy loam
over a very pale brown and highly
calcareous silt loam. The upper soil is
relatively recent, Holocene-age alluvium,
whereas the underlying sediment is
comprised of ancient terrace deposits with
CaCO3 development (see Figure 8).

Site 41FR92 is a prehistoric open campsite
located in a plowed agricultural field on the
east/northeast side of the Frio River. An
Early Archaic dart point with characteristics
of the Bell/Bulverde continuum was
encountered on the ground surface and
despite excellent surface visibility, no other
diagnostic artifacts were identified.

The site area measures approximately 265 m
northwest–southeast by 200 m southwest–
northeast based upon surface artifact
distribution. Extensive surface disturbance is
evident due to agricultural activity, as
essentially all cultural material is contained
within the plow zone.

The lack of intact deposits or cultural
features in a heavily disturbed surface
context leaves little to no potential for the
site to yield information important to the
prehistory of the region. Due to its limited
research value, SWCA does not recommend
site 41FR92 as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.

Site 41FR92 was largely confined to the
active agricultural plow zone, with one
artifact noted at a lower depth due to
bioturbation. Artifacts include one Early
Archaic
Bell/Bulverde
dart
point,
approximately five biface fragments, lithic
debitage, and burned rock. A thorough
surface inspection was conducted to identify
the extent of the surface artifact scatter
beyond the survey corridor, however, no
subsurface tests were excavated beyond the
ROW limit. One backhoe trench (Frio-1)
was excavated to assess the subsurface
potential of the site, which was positive for
cultural material (Appendix B). Several
chert flakes were noted in the upper 46 cmbs
of this trench (primarily in the upper 22
cmbs) and one chert flake was recovered at a
depth of 57 cmbs. No cultural features were
identified in a surficial or subsurface context

41FR93 (MS36)
Site 41FR93 is a prehistoric open campsite
located in southwestern Frio County within
HPA 3CMS89 (Appendix A.104–105). The
site is situated approximately 150 m south of
Todos Santos Creek in a wooded area to the
east of CR 4515 and just north of open
agricultural cropland.
Vegetation consists of mesquite, mixed
hardwoods, sparse grass, and greenbriar,
which typically affords less than 40 percent
surface visibility across the site. The surface
texture is silty to sandy loam with few
gravels. Soil consists of silty to sandy clay
loam that becomes increasingly compact
with more frequent CaCO3 inclusions as
depth increases. Shovel tests on the site were
terminated at depths of 15–55 cmbs due to
very compact soil, CaCO3, or ancient clayey
subsoil.

The artifact assemblage primarily consists of
lithic debitage and burned rock, with a few
bifacial tools and one reworked Bell or
Bulverde dart point (Figure 18). The dart
point is indicative of an Early Archaic
presence and no other diagnostic artifacts or
cultural features were encountered.

investigations or avoidance are warranted
for the site.

The site spans approximately 630 m east–
west by 30 m north–south based upon
surface artifact distribution, shovel test
results, and the project area boundary. A
two-track roadway and transmission line
corridor parallel the northern site boundary
then cross to the south in the eastern portion
of the site. The surrounding area consists of
agricultural land and it is likely that the site
area was cleared in the past, as the
vegetation is indicative of secondary growth.

41FR94 (MS37)
Site 41FR94 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
located in southwestern Frio County within
HPA 3CMS89 (Appendix A.105). The site
is situated in a wooded area immediately
south of Todos Santos Creek and was
identified in a single shovel test (AC21).
SWCA recommended mechanical trenching
based on the alluvial setting and the results
of investigations along Todos Santos Creek,
however, DCP will avoid impacts to the site
via HDD beneath the area. Investigation of
the site was therefore limited (Figure 19).

Site 41FR93 was primarily identified
through shovel testing with sparse cultural
material also noted on the ground surface
during the centerline survey. A total of 15
shovel tests (AC1–AC15) were excavated,
seven of which (AC4, AC7–AC9, AC11,
AC14, and AC15) were positive for cultural
material to a maximum depth of 60 cmbs
(Appendix B). Most of the artifacts were
present within the upper 20 cm of sediment
and include 11 tertiary flakes, one
indeterminate chert shatter, three burned
rock fragments, and one burned clay nodule.
No cultural features were identified within
the site area.

Vegetation consists of mesquite trees and
patchy grass which afforded approximately
40 percent surface visibility at the time of
survey. The ground surface is loamy with
few natural gravel. Soil consists of silty
loam that becomes lighter in color and more
compact with depth. A total of three shovel
tests were excavated in the area (AC21–
AC23), two of which reached a depth of 100
cmbs, at which point they were terminated
due depth (Appendix B). One of these was
positive for cultural material (AC21).

SUMMARY

Site 41FR93 is a large and diffuse
prehistoric campsite with surficial and
shallowly buried cultural material and no
identified cultural features. A total of 16
artifacts were recovered from a subsurface
context, scattered between the surface and
60 cmbs, and no diagnostic artifacts were
encountered.

Site 41FR94 was identified in a subsurface
context in one positive shovel test, AC21.
Artifacts include one two tertiary flakes at
20–30 cmbs, one cortical flake at 60–70
cmbs, and one core at 95 cmbs (Appendix
B). No artifacts were noted on the ground
surface. The site area is estimated to be less
than 300 m east–west and 30 m north–south
based on shovel test results, the limits of the
current project area, and the natural
landform. No diagnostic artifacts or cultural
features were identified.

The lack of intact deposits, diagnostic
artifacts, or cultural features leaves little to
no potential for the site to yield information
important to the prehistory of the region.
Due to its limited research value, SWCA
does not recommend site 41FR93 as eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP and no further

County within HPA 3CMS25. The site is
situated in a generally rocky upland setting
where sparse cultural material was
encountered on both the east and west sides
of an ephemeral drainage (Appendix A.99).

SUMMARY

Site 41FR94 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
located on the south bank of Todos Santos
Creek. No temporally diagnostic artifacts or
cultural features were encountered. As
noted, investigation of the site was limited
due to the potential for cultural deposits
exceeding 1 m in depth. DCP will avoid
impacts to the site via HDD beneath the area
during pipeline construction.

Bedrock is exposed across much of the
upland landform, with shallow soils in some
areas, including the drainage channel.
Vegetation consists of mesquite and low
scrub brush which afforded approximately
70 percent surface visibility. Soil consists of
sandy clay loam which terminated at reddish
to grayish brown silty clay subsoil or
limestone bedrock at depths generally
ranging from 40–60 cmbs.

Due to the alluvial site setting in close
proximity to Todos Santos Creek and the
potential for deep cultural material, SWCA
recommended backhoe trenching on the
property. Mechanical excavation was not
permitted by the landowner at the time of
survey, so DCP will avoid impacts to site
41FR94 via HDD. Beginning and ending
points were placed beyond negative shovel
tests in each direction, which are well
beyond the area of identified cultural
material, and the depth of the bore will
exceed all cultural deposition documented
on Todos Santos Creek during the current
investigation.

The site area measures approximately 310 m
north–south by 1,000 m east–west based
upon surface artifact distribution and shovel
test results. A total of 15 shovel tests
(DA75–DA80, MC67–MC71, and TN68–
TN71) were excavated, five of which
(DA76, DA80, MC67, MC71, and TN68)
were positive for cultural material
(Appendix B). Surface artifacts were
observed extending to the north and south,
however, complete investigation of these
areas was not conducted due to ROW
restrictions. A transmission line corridor
parallels the proposed ROW and has
severely impacted the shallow artifacts in
this area. The landowner also informed
investigators that the area was previously
utilized as farmland and had been plowed
for approximately 100 years. Aside from
modern disturbance, sheet erosion has also
impacted the integrity of the site.

Due to the limits of the current investigation,
SWCA considers the NRHP eligibility of
site 41FR94 as undetermined. In accordance
with this recommendation, DCP will not
impact the site and will instead bore beneath
the maximum depth of identified cultural
material for the length of the site (Figure
18). As the site is to be avoided no further
investigations are warranted at this time.
Should design/engineering plans change,
investigation is recommended to explore the
site’s potential to yield additional
information.

Site 41FR95 was identified on the ground
surface with subsequent shovel tests
recovering cultural material to a maximum
depth of 40 cmbs. Artifacts include four
Tortugas dart points, non-diagnostic bifacial
tools (n<10), cores, hammerstones, lithic
debitage (n=75+), and burned rock. Limited

41FR95 (MS16)
Site 41FR95 is large Middle Archaic
campsite located in western central Frio

situated at the southern margin of the Leona
River floodplain, extending onto a rising
gravelly slope to the east (Appendix A.98).

surface inspection was conducted beyond
the survey corridor to the north and south,
however, no shovel tests were excavated
beyond the ROW limit. No cultural features
were identified within the site area.

Vegetation across the floodplain consists of
scattered mesquite with no ground cover.
Surface visibility is approximately 95
percent and very few gravels are present. In
contrast, hillslope vegetation consists of
fairly thick blackbrush, where dense,
rounded chert gravels and cobbles cover the
ground surface (Figure 21). Surface
visibility in this portion of the site is
approximately 50 percent. Soil consists of
sandy loam over a very dark gray to dark
brownish red clay subsoil or limestone
bedrock at depths generally ranging from
20–60 cmbs. The site area measures
approximately 650 m diameter based upon
surface artifact distribution and shovel test
results.

The artifact assemblage primarily consists of
lithic debitage scattered over a broad area,
with small areas of increased artifact
frequency. Bifacial tools, including the
Tortugas dart points for example, were often
found in close proximity to one another and
likely indicate isolated activity areas within
the generally sparse site. All diagnostic
artifacts (four Tortugas dart points) indicate
a late Middle Archaic presence, but due to
the deflated, surficial nature of the site, it is
unknown whether other temporal periods are
represented in the assemblage (Figure 20).
No cultural features were identified.
SUMMARY

Site 41FR96 was identified on the ground
surface with subsequent shovel tests
recovering cultural material to a maximum
depth of 60 cmbs. Artifacts include one Late
Prehistoric Perdiz arrow point, a few
expedient bifacial tools, one crude knife, one
end scraper, lithic debitage, and burned
rock. A surface inspection was conducted
beyond the survey corridor to the north and
south, however, no shovel tests were
excavated beyond the ROW limit and the
entirety of the scatter was not investigated
due to its large size. A total of 12 shovel
tests (DA70–DA73, MC61–MC65, and
TN63–TN65) were excavated, ten of which
(DA70–DA73, MC61, MC62, MC64, and
TN63–TN65 were positive for cultural
material to a maximum depth of 60 cmbs
(Appendix B). Most of this material (N=79
debitage, N=15 FCR, N=one burned earth)
was confined to the upper 20 cmbs. No
cultural features were identified within the
site area.

Site 41FR95 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
with no identified cultural features, and
relatively little buried cultural material
within a disturbed context. Diagnostic
Tortugas dart points indicate activity during
the late Middle Archaic period, however, the
surficial context may represent additional,
mixed cultural deposits.
The lack of intact deposition or cultural
features in a disturbed surface context leaves
little to no potential for the site to yield
information important to the prehistory of
the region. Due to its limited research value,
SWCA does not recommend site 41FR95 as
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.
41FR96 (MS15)
Site 41FR96 is a Late Prehistoric open
campsite located in western central Frio
County within HPA 3CMS24. The site is
76

Figure 20. Site 41FR95 Tortugas dart points, planview.

Figure 21. Site 41FR96 hillslope surface facing southeast.

Surface artifacts were increasingly dense to
the north of the ROW, however, complete
investigation of this area was not conducted
due to the great distance from the project
corridor. A transmission line corridor and
multiple existing parallel the proposed ROW
and have severely impacted the site within
the project area. The landowner also
informed investigators that the area was
previously utilized as farmland and had been
plowed for approximately 100 years.
Additionally, the landowner was aware of
the site and had collected artifacts in the area
following heavy rains for the past 40 years.
He was, however, unwilling to share
information regarding the types of artifacts
he had encountered.

41KY158 (TN6)

The artifact assemblage primarily consists of
lithic debitage and burned rock, with a
single Perdiz arrow point base, and a small
number of non-diagnostic bifacial tools. No
cultural features were identified.

The site is roughly 550 m north–south by
450 m east–west, based on the distribution
of surface artifacts and subsurface artifact
recovery (Figure 22). The site continues
outside of the limited survey area, however,
access restrictions prevented full site
boundary delineation.

Site 41KY158 is a Middle to Late Archaic
prehistoric open campsite located in
southeast Kinney County within HPA
3CTN4. The site is situated on a deflated
terrace on the south side of Elm Creek
(Appendix A.63). The dominant vegetation
includes moderate to dense mesquite trees
and prickly pear cacti, allowing for 70–100
percent surface visibility. Soils across the
site consist of yellowish-brown to brown
silty clay loam overlying brownish-yellow
sand and reddish-yellow clay loam. Impacts
to the site include some land clearing for a
two-track road and fenceline that bisect the
site and probable surface collecting.

SUMMARY

Site 41FR96 is a prehistoric open campsite
and quarry area with no identified cultural
features. The majority of buried material is
confined to a disturbed context as a result of
agricultural activity. One Perdiz arrow point
base encountered to the north of the ROW
indicates activity during the Late Prehistoric
period.
The
landowner
confirmed
encountering additional diagnostic artifacts
on the site but did not disclose the type or
temporal association.

Site 41KY158 was identified during the
centerline survey when a variety of
prehistoric artifacts were observed on the
surface. A thorough inspection to identify
the extent of the surface artifact scatter was
conducted within the HPA and survey
corridor limits. Delineation of the northern
site extent outside of the survey corridor was
attempted, however, time constraints and
landowner access restrictions prevented a
full site delineation. The southern portion of
the site was only delineated within the
survey corridor due to landowner access
restrictions.

The lack of intact deposits or cultural
features in a disturbed surface context leaves
little to no potential for the site to yield
information important to the prehistory of
the region. Due to its limited research value,
SWCA does not recommend site 41FR96 as
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.

were excavated (Appendix B). Twenty-two
of the 43 delineation shovel tests were
positive for cultural material (AY61, AY62,

cmbs, with no clear stratification. The
artifact assemblage consists of lithic
debitage (50+ primary, 100+ secondary,
150+ tertiary), cultural shatter (50+), burned
rock (50+), 2 cores, 10 bifaces, 6 dart points
(2 Ensor, 2 Langtry, Frio, Marshall) and 3
mussel shell. The presence of Ensor,
Langtry, Frio and Marshall dart points
suggest a Middle to Late Archaic
occupation. Two burned rock concentrations
at the site may be deflated hearth or sheet
middens. Burned rock was also recovered
from shovel tests, indicating potential for
buried features.

41KY159 (TN7)
Site 41KY159 is a prehistoric open campsite
of an unknown age located in southeast
Kinney County within HPA 3CTN4. The
site is situated on a deflated terrace on the
north side of Elm Creek (Appendix A.63).
The dominant vegetation includes moderate
to dense mesquite trees and prickly pear
cacti, allowing for 75–100 percent surface
visibility. Soils on the site consist of light
gray to brown silty loam that becomes
increasingly compact with depth. Shovel test
CS38 encountered a dense gravel lens at 80
cmbs. Impacts to the site include some land
clearing for a two-track road and fenceline
that bisect the site and probable surface
collecting.

SUMMARY

Site 41KY158 is a multi-component site
with diagnostic artifacts from the Middle to
Late Archaic periods. The location and
artifact assemblage (e.g., lithic debitage,
tools, mussel shell and burned rock)
suggests an open campsite (Collins 2004).
Two burned rock concentrations were
recorded at the site, suggesting possible
deflated hearths or sheet middens. In
addition, burned rock recovered from shovel
tests indicates the potential for buried
cultural features.

The site is roughly 55 m north–south by 55
m east–west, based on the distribution of
surface artifacts and survey corridor limits.
Three shovel tests were excavated (CS38,
DR123, and PB48), none of which were
positive for cultural material (Appendix B).
The site may continue to the northeast and
southwest outside of the limited survey area,
however, ROW restrictions prevented full
site boundary delineation.
Site 41KY159 was identified during the
centerline survey when a variety of
prehistoric artifacts were observed on the
surface. A thorough inspection to identify
the extent of the surface artifact scatter was
conducted within the HPA and survey
corridor limits. The artifact assemblage
consists of lithic debitage (5+ primary, 10+
secondary, 20+ tertiary), cultural shatter

Due to the presence of temporally diagnostic
artifacts, buried artifacts, and potential
cultural features, SWCA concludes that site
41KY158 has the potential to yield new and
unique information regarding prehistoric
activity in the region. SWCA therefore
recommends that the NRHP eligibility status
of site 41KY158 is currently undetermined,
pending further investigation. In accordance

(10+), and 1 biface. Burned rock scattered
on the surface are likely remnants of
deflated hearths, however, no concentrations
or intact features were discovered within the
survey corridor.

Site 41KY160 was identified entirely on the
ground surface during the centerline survey.
Artifacts encountered were limited to
primary and secondary lithic debitage. A
thorough surface inspection of the ROW
was conducted to define the extent of the
surface artifact scatter within the project
area, and due to the surficial nature of the
artifact scatter and the absence of cultural
features or diagnostic artifacts, no
investigation of the surrounding area was
conducted. It is likely that the site extends to
the east and west beyond the survey
corridor. A total of five shovel tests (DR254,
DR255, TN89, TN90, and TS261) were
excavated, none of which were positive for
cultural material (Appendix B). All but one
shovel test encountered limestone bedrock at
a depth of 5–10 cmbs.

SUMMARY

Site 41KY159 is a prehistoric open campsite
of an unknown age. The site has been
moderately impacted by land clearing
activity. Within the survey corridor, the
assemblage is entirely surficial in nature and
non-diagnostic with no potential to yield
information important to the prehistory of
the region. Due to its limited research value,
SWCA considers site 41KY159 ineligible
for NRHP nomination. No further work or
avoidance is recommended for the site.
41KY160 (MS26)
Site 41KY160 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
located in northwestern Kinney County
within HPA 3CMS57. The site is located in
an undulating upland landscape with
limestone and chert cobbles across the
surface. Two unnamed drainages are present
within the site boundary, which feed into
Sycamore Creek approximately 1 mile west
of the project area (Appendix A.46).
Subsequent to SWCA’s survey the site was
also documented by TRC in conjunction
with an unspecified, privately funded
project.

No tools, burned rock, or cultural features
were encountered during the investigation.
The temporal association of the site is
therefore unknown and the research value is
limited. All artifacts were noted on the
deflated and gravelly ground surface.
SUMMARY

Site 41KY160 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
with shallow, gravelly soil, no buried
cultural material, and no identified cultural
features within the ROW. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts were encountered and
the site is therefore of unknown antiquity.

Vegetation consists of mesquite, acacia,
prickly pear cacti, and prairie sage. The
surface is silty and gravelly and overall
surface visibility is approximately 50–75
percent. Soil consists of gravelly, silty clay
loam over limestone bedrock at a maximum
depth of 30 cmbs. The site dimensions are
approximately 350 m northwest–southeast
by 30 m southwest–northeast based upon
surface artifact distribution and shovel test
results. Disturbance of the site area with the

The shallow soil lack of intact deposits or
cultural features in a disturbed surface
context leaves little to no potential for the
site to yield information important to the
prehistory of the region. Due to its limited
research value, SWCA does not recommend
site 41KY160 as eligible for inclusion in the

82

Site 41KY172 was identified strictly on the
ground surface during the centerline survey.
Artifacts include one proximal biface
fragment, one chert core, lithic debitage
(n=75+), and burned rock. A thorough
surface inspection was conducted to identify
the extent of the surface artifact scatter
beyond the survey corridor, however, no
shovel tests were excavated beyond the
ROW limit. Two concentrations of large
burned rock cobbles were noted to the south
of the ROW that may be cultural in nature
and no features were identified within the
project area. Notably, the potential features
are located in the area of existing pipeline
markers and could simply be related to this
disturbance.

NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.
41KY172 (MS18)
Site 41KY172 is a prehistoric open campsite
located in central Kinney County within
HPA 3CMS30. The site is situated on the
edge of the terrace east of Elm Creek
(Appendix A.54). The channel is a gravelly
depression within an 80–90 m floodplain
where it crosses the ROW, with a steep rise
up to the terrace. Nearby washouts are
incised
through
the
gravels
and
approximately 50 cm into a yellowish gray
clay subsoil. Elm Creek feeds into Las
Moras Creek and eventually the Rio Grande
approximately 25 miles south of site
41KY172.

The artifact assemblage primarily consists of
lithic debitage and burned rock, and no
diagnostic artifacts were encountered. The
burned rock concentrations are likely not
intact below the surface based on shovel test
results and the presence of an existing
pipeline.

Vegetation consists of mesquite, prickly
pear cacti, acacia, and patchy, mid length
grasses. Overall surface visibility is
approximately 50–70 percent across the site.
The ground surface is gravelly, with the
highest percentage present along the eroded
terrace edge. Soil consists of brown to
yellowish brown silty clay loam with
increasing clay content and CaCO3 at depths
ranging from 40–55 cmbs.

SUMMARY

Site 41KY172 is a prehistoric open campsite
with shallow, gravelly soil, no buried
cultural material, and no diagnostic artifacts.
Two potential cultural features were noted to
the south of the current project area,
however, an existing pipeline was noted in
the immediate area and these concentrations
are likely disturbed by or a result of
construction activity.

The site area is approximately 100 m north–
south by 50 m east–west based upon surface
artifact distribution and shovel test results. A
total of six shovel tests (DA112, DA113,
SW84, SW85, TS86, and TS87) were
excavated, none of which were positive for
cultural material (Appendix B). A two-track
roadway parallels a property fenceline along
the northern site boundary and an existing
pipeline runs through the central portion of
the site, to the south of the current project
area. In addition to natural surface erosion,
these modern impacts have contributed to
the currently deflated and disturbed nature
of the site.

The lack of intact cultural features, buried
deposits, or temporally diagnostic artifacts
leaves little to no potential for the site to
yield information important to the prehistory
of the region. Due to its limited research
value, SWCA does not recommend site
41KY172 as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.

TS100). Most lithic debitage was
encountered between the surface and 25
cmbs, with a few pieces from a maximum of
55 cmbs. No cultural material was noted on
the ground surface and no features or
diagnostic artifacts were encountered.

41KY173 (MS19)
Site 41KY173 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
located in south central Kinney County
within HPA 3CMS33. The site is situated on
the gently sloping east bank of Las Moras
Creek where the rocky-bottom creek
channel is approximately 5 m wide and
incised approximately 50–100 cm. At the
time of survey there was shallow running
water in the Las Moras Creek channel when
most all other drainages in the area were dry
(Figure 23). Within the ROW, the floodplain
is broad on the west side of the channel with
a steep western bank, whereas the eastern
side slopes gradually and becomes very
rocky as it continues to rise in elevation east
of the site.

SUMMARY

Site 41KY173 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
with minimal cultural material within the
project area. The artifact assemblage
consists of 10 pieces of lithic debitage and
no burned rock, cultural features, or
diagnostic artifacts were encountered. The
site is shallowly buried with no discernible
stratification.
The lack of intact cultural material and
absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts or
cultural stratification leaves little to no
potential for the site to yield information
important to the prehistory of the region.
Due to its limited research value, SWCA
does not recommend site 41KY173 as
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.

Vegetation within the floodplain and site
area consists of mature pecan and live oak
trees, mountain laurel, green briar, and short
grass. Overall surface visibility is
approximately 30 percent across the site.
The soil consists of dark silty loam and
shovel tests were terminated at compact soil
with high CaCO3 content or dense gravels at
30–70 cmbs.

41KY174 (MS27)

The site area is approximately 40 m north–
south by 60 m east–west based upon shovel
test results. A two-track roadway parallels
the property fenceline, veers south across
the site area, and crosses the creek at a
concrete bridge. Apparent subsurface
disturbance on the site is limited to one
overhead utility pole.

Site 41KY174 is a prehistoric campsite,
identified in a level area within a gently
undulating to rugged upland landscape
where the proposed ROW parallels FM 2523
in northwestern Kinney County; HPA
3CMS59. Maurice Canyon is located to the
east, beyond the limits of the ROW
(Appendix A.44).

Site 41KY173 was identified strictly in a
subsurface context during the centerline
survey. A total of twelve shovel tests
(DA119, DA121–DA123, SW95–SW98,
TS96, and TS99–101) were excavated in the
site area (Appendix B). Artifacts include 10
pieces of chert debitage that were recovered
in four shovel tests (SW98, TS96, TS99, and

Vegetation in the area consists of scattered
mesquite scrub, prickly pear cacti, and
prairie sage, which afforded approximately
50–75 percent surface visibility. The
surficial soil texture is silty with limestone
gravels. The soil is approximately 50–73 cm
deep, at which point limestone bedrock was

typically encountered. A small number of
shovel tests did not encounter bedrock but
were terminated at similar depths depth due
to compact soil. The site measures
approximately 175 m northeast–southwest
by 30 m northwest–southeast based upon
surface artifact distribution, shovel test
results, and the limits of the ROW.

cultural features leaves little to no potential
for the site to yield information important to
the prehistory of the region. Due to its
limited research value, SWCA does not
recommend site 41KY174 as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and no further
investigations or avoidance are warranted
for the site.

Site 41KY174 is extremely sparse and was
identified on the ground surface and through
shovel testing during the centerline survey.
Artifacts include lithic debitage and burned
rock fragments. Due to ROW restrictions,
inspection was limited to the project area. A
total of nine shovel tests (DR261–DR263,
TN106–TN108, and TS276–TS278) were
excavated, five of which (DR261, DR262,
TN106, TS277, and TS278) were positive
for cultural material to a maximum depth of
60 cmbs (Appendix B). Buried material
consists of a total of 10 tertiary chert flakes.
One small concentration of burned rock was
noted on the ground surface in the southwest
portion of the site. The concentration is also
near an animal burrow and may be a result
of non-cultural activity (Figure 24). The
artifact assemblage consists exclusively of a
diffuse scatter of lithic debitage and burned
rock. No tools or concentrations of cultural
material were identified.

41KY175 (MS33)
Site 41KY175 is a prehistoric campsite,
identified on the north side of Maurice
Canyon in northwestern Kinney County,
HPA 3CMS85. The site is located on a level,
gravelly terrace along the northeast side of
FM 2523 (Appendix A.42). The proposed
centerline is located on private property to
which right-of-entry was not permitted. As
such, survey was conducted within the
public ROW of FM 2523 approximately 10
m southwest of the centerline.
Vegetation within the existing ROW
consists of maintained, patchy grass. Low,
thorny scrub brush and prickly pear cacti are
present along and across the fenceline.
Approximately 50 percent of the ground
surface was visible at the time of survey and
the soil texture at the surface is silty with
frequent limestone gravels. Limestone
bedrock was encountered at a maximum
depth of 38 cmbs.

SUMMARY

Site 41KY174 is a prehistoric campsite
located between the west side of Maurice
Canyon and the east edge of FM 2523. A
small amount of lithic debitage and burned
rock was noted, with no tools and one
concentration of burned rock that may or
may not be of cultural origin. No diagnostic
material was present on the site and no
definitive temporal association can be
assigned to the site.

The site measures approximately 65 m
northwest–southeast by 12 m northeast–
southwest based upon surface artifact
distribution and the limits of the
investigation. Some cultural material was
noted across the fenceline to the northeast
and it is likely that the site continues in this
direction but its extent is unknown. FM

maintenance have all affected the integrity
of the surficial site.
Site 41KY175 is extremely sparse and was
identified strictly on the ground surface
during the centerline survey. Artifacts
observed include 2 biface fragments, 6
pieces of lithic debitage, and a small amount
of burned rock. Inspection was limited to the
FM 2523 ROW and very few artifacts were
visible on the surface of the adjacent
property. A total of four shovel tests (MP30,
MP31, MS18, and TN198) were excavated,
none of which were positive for cultural
material (Appendix B). No cultural features
or diagnostic artifacts were identified.

Vegetation across the site is sparse,
consisting of scattered mesquite, acacia, and
cacti. The surface is silty and gravelly and
overall surface visibility is approximately
75–90 percent. Soil consists of silty to sandy
clay loam which becomes very compact
with CaCO3 development at 30–45 cmbs.
The site dimensions are approximately 180
m north–south by 130 m east–west based
upon surface artifact distribution and shovel
test results. A two-track roadway cuts
through the center of the site, around which
the area is largely devoid of vegetation. An
erosional channel has been incised into the
site on the south side of the road, attesting to
the rate of surface erosion in the area.

SUMMARY

Based on the location and artifact
assemblage, site 41KY175 is a surficial
prehistoric campsite. Two biface fragments,
six flakes, and a small amount of burned
rock were noted within the FM 2523 ROW,
directly adjacent to the proposed centerline.
As no diagnostic material was present, no
temporal association can be assigned to the
site.

Site 41MV367 was identified on the surface
during the centerline survey, which extended
HPA 3CMS16 to the southeast. A thorough
surface inspection was conducted to identify
the extent of the surface artifact scatter
beyond the survey corridor, however, no
shovel tests were excavated beyond the
ROW limit. A total of six shovel tests
(SS10, SS11, SW9, SW10, TS9, and TS10)
were excavated, none of which were
positive for cultural material (Appendix B).

The overall paucity of cultural material, lack
of buried deposits, or cultural features leaves
little to no potential for the site to yield
information important to the prehistory of
the region. Due to its limited research value,
SWCA does not recommend site 41KY175
as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.

The artifact assemblage consists mainly of
lithic debitage and formal tools, including
one Late Prehistoric Scallorn arrow point,
seven dart points, and a single biface
fragment. Dart points that retained
diagnostic attributes date to the Early to
Transitional Archaic periods (including one
Nolan, one Casroville-like and two Ensor;
Figure 25). Two burned rock features were
noted to the north of the ROW, however,
none were identified within the survey
corridor. All of these artifacts and features

41MV369 (MS24)
Site 41MV369 is a Late Prehistoric open
campsite located in northeastern Maverick
County within HPA 3CMS54. The site is
situated on a relatively flat terrace to the
south/southeast of Mula Creek, where
multiple erosional channels have been
incised into the site area along the sloping
bank (Appendix A.68).

Artifacts include two Late Prehistoric Perdiz
arrow point bases, multiple biface
fragments, tertiary lithic debitage, and
burned rock. One concentration of burned
rock was identified as a potential cultural
feature near the northeast edge of the survey
corridor.
The
feature
consists
of
approximately 15 fragments of burned rock
in a roughly circular concentration, located
within a patch of vegetation on the eroding
edge of the low terrace. The main
concentration measures approximately 70
cm in diameter and another 20 fragments of
burned rock were found within an eroded
wash within 2 m of the concentration.
Shovel test DR245 was excavated directly
adjacent to the feature and was negative for
cultural material.

Vegetation consists of mesquite, blackbrush,
and pencil cactus. At the time of survey,
approximately 75 percent of the ground
surface was visible. The ground surface is
sandy with many small cherty gravels. The
main drainage through the area, Mula Creek,
creates the northern site boundary and is
approximately 1 m deep by 5 m wide with a
sandy clay bottom within the project area.
Soil across the site consists of dark
yellowish to red sandy clay and all shovel
tests were terminated at 20–60 cmbs due to
compact, sterile clay. The site spans
approximately 50 m north–south by 115 m
east–west based upon surface artifact
distribution and shovel test results. The area
is relatively discreet within the open setting,
with most of the material identified within
of in close proximity to a graded but
otherwise unimproved roadway that
traverses the site from northeast–southwest.
Due to the shallow nature of soils and the
surficial cultural material, grading of this
road along with natural erosion of the
ground surface has greatly impacted the
integrity of the site.

SUMMARY

Site 41MV369 is a horizontally discreet,
Late Prehistoric open campsite comprised of
a surficial lithic and burned rock scatter and
one potential burned rock feature. Two
Perdiz arrow point bases were encountered
on the ground surface along a graded
roadway and six shovel tests produced one
fragment of burned rock at a depth of 10–20
cmbs.
The overall surficial nature of the site and
lack of intact deposits leaves little to no
potential for the site to yield information
important to the prehistory of the region.

(Figure 28). This was found within the
disturbed roadway context near one
potential cultural feature. This feature was
identified along the fenceline in the
northwestern portion of the site. The feature
consists of approximately 20 burned rock
fragments concentrated within a 1 m area,
along a barbed wire fenceline. Due to the
feature location, adjacent to a fenceline and
in very close proximity to a heavily eroded
two-track roadway, it has likely been
disturbed. Based on shovel test results and
the heavily eroded soil across the site, it is
highly unlikely that there is any subsurface
component to the feature.

41MV370 (MS25)
Site 41MV370 is a Transitional Archaic
open campsite, located in northeastern
Maverick County on the west side of Palo
Blanco Creek; within HPA 3CMS55. The
site is situated within a heavily eroded and
undulating area, where multiple channels
have been incised to a depth of 20–30 cm
across the site area (Appendix A.69).
Vegetation consists of sparse mesquite,
acacia, and cacti. The site is mainly present
along a fenceline and parallel two-track
roadway where surface erosion has stripped
at least 20–30 cm of soil, leaving natural
gravels and cultural materials exposed
across the surface. Overall surface visibility
is approximately 75 percent. Soil on the site
consists of a dark yellowish brown to pale
brown silty clay loam over dark brown silty
clay. The site area measures 50 m northeast–
southwest by 125 m northwest–southeast
based upon surface artifact distribution and
shovel test results. Disturbance on the site is
primarily attributed to general surface
erosion and a two-track roadway that
traverses the northern portion of the site.

SUMMARY

Site 41MV370 is a Transitional Archaic
open campsite with a surficial assemblage
consisting of a few tools, lithic debitage,
burned rock, and a single burned rock
feature. One Fairland dart point was
encountered and all artifacts were confined
to the ground surface. The soil is sterile and
compact, and shovel tests were terminated at
depths no greater than 40 cmbs. Heavy
erosion across the site has removed
approximately 20–30 cm of soil, as is
evident in low ridges where vegetation has
held the soil in place.
The lack of buried deposits or intact cultural
features and the deflated nature of the soil
leaves little to no potential for the site to
yield information important to the prehistory
of the region. Due to its limited research
value, SWCA does not recommend site
41MV370 as eligible for inclusion in the

Site 41MV370 was identified entirely on the
ground surface during the centerline survey.
A total of four shovel tests (DR247, TN81,
TN82, and TS251) were excavated, none of
which were positive for buried cultural
material (Appendix B). Shovel tests were
terminated at depths ranging between 30–40
cmbs due to compact, sterile soil.
The artifact assemblage is primarily
comprised of lithic debitage and burned
rock, with one bifacial tool and one

SUMMARY

NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.

Site 41MV371 is a prehistoric campsite that
was confined to the ground surface. A small
amount of lithic debitage and burned rock
was noted, with no tools or cultural features.
As no diagnostic material was present, no
temporal association can be assigned to the
site.

41MV371 (MS4)
Site 41MV371 is a prehistoric campsite,
identified on the west side of a small,
unnamed drainage in northeastern Maverick
County, HPA 3CMS17. The site is located
on a level landform where ephemeral
drainages ultimately feed into Buck Hollow
and Palo Blanco Creek (Appendix A.72).

The overall paucity of cultural material, lack
of tools, intact deposits, or cultural features
leaves little to no potential for the site to
yield information important to the prehistory
of the region. Due to its limited research
value, SWCA does not recommend site
41MV371 as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.

Vegetation in the area of the scatter consists
of low mesquite scrub and cacti affording
approximately 75 percent surface visibility.
Soil at the surface consists of silty clay with
very few gravels. The soil is approximately
30–50 cm deep, at which point shovel tests
were terminated due to sterile and very
compact soil with increasing clay content.
The site measures approximately 40 m
northeast–southwest by 160 m northwest–
southeast based upon surface artifact
distribution and shovel test results. Aside
from previous vegetation, no modern
disturbance was noted.

41ZV96
Site 41ZV96 is a previously recorded
Middle Archaic open campsite located
roughly 12 km southwest of La Pryor, Texas
in Zavala County. The site is situated on the
western floodplain of an unnamed tributary
of Turkey Creek 2.7 km south of Highway
57 within HPA 3CKL4 (Appendix A.76).
The initial recording of 41ZV96 noted dense
lithic debitage, burned rock, and one
Pedernales dart point (Atlas 2012; Hester
1978). No cultural features or artifact
concentrations were initially noted and no
recommendations regarding further work or
NRHP eligibility were made.

Site 41MV371 is extremely sparse and was
identified strictly on the ground surface
during the centerline survey. A total of four
shovel tests (MS3, MS4, SS12, and SS13)
were excavated, none of which were
positive for cultural material (Appendix B).
The artifact assemblage consists of
approximately 10 pieces of lithic debitage
and burned rock fragments. Due to the
paucity of cultural material, inspection was
limited to the ROW. No tools or
concentrations of burned rock are present
and the cultural material is extremely sparse.
No artifacts were encountered in a
subsurface context.

The proposed IIIC corridor is situated within
100 m of north of 41ZV96 and no evidence
of the site was observed within the proposed
corridor. Vegetation in the area consists of
low mesquite scrub and cacti affording
approximately 75 percent surface visibility.
Of note, highly fragmented chert shatter was
observed in a two-track roadway that crosses
the IIIC corridor east of 41ZV96. The chert
shatter in the roadway was indeterminate

A total of nine shovel tests (CS30, CS109,
ID29, KL35, KL36, PB177, and TS230–
TS232) were excavated, none of which were
positive for cultural material (Appendix B).
The artifact assemblage is limited to sparse
lithic debitage and one bifacial tool. No
diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were
identified within the project area.

The lack of intact, buried deposits, or
cultural features on gullied land leaves little
to no potential for the site to yield
information important to the prehistory of
the region. Due to its limited research value,
SWCA does not recommend site 41ZV181
as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.

SUMMARY

41ZV443

Site 41ZV443 is a diffuse prehistoric quarry
comprised of a surface scatter of lithic
debitage in a gravelly, upland setting. No
buried cultural material, diagnostic artifacts,
or cultural features were encountered;
therefore, no temporal association has been
determined. Additional cultural material was
noted to the southwest of the cultural survey
corridor by SWCA biologists.

Site 41ZV443 a large and diffuse prehistoric
quarry, located in northwest-central Zavala
County in HPA 3CKL7. The site was
previously recorded, however, only a site
centroid was documented (Atlas 2012). The
current investigation encountered a surface
scatter of lithic debitage that spans the area
between two upland drainages that converge
to the southwest of the site and feed into
Turkey Creek (Appendix A.79).

The lack of intact deposits, diagnostic
artifacts, or cultural features leaves little to
no potential for the site to yield information
important to the prehistory of the region.
Due to its limited research value, SWCA
does not recommend site 41ZV443 as
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.

Vegetation consists of mesquite scrub brush
across a gently undulating upland landscape,
where overall surface visibility is
approximately 50–90 percent. Soil on the
site consists of a dark yellowish brown to
dark reddish brown clay loam over thick
clay at depths of 15–35 cmbs. The site is
located near the drainage headwaters and
both channels are very shallowly incised
within the project area.

41ZV455
Site 41ZV455 is possible Paleoindian
campsite that was first identified by SWCA
in 2006 (Atlas 2012). The previous site
boundary was limited to the US Hwy 57
ROW, which was extended approximately
75 m to the north based on the results of the
current investigation of HPA 3CVV1
(Appendix A.76). Previous records indicate
that one Angostura projectile point, two
utilized flakes, one core, one bifacial
preform, and at least 20 pieces of debitage
were encountered. Also present was a sparse
scatter of fire-cracked rock and a few mussel
shell fragments. Based on the level of

The site area measures 500 m northwest–
southeast by 150 m northeast–southwest
based upon surface artifact distribution.
Disturbance on the site is primarily
attributed to a two-track roadway along the
southwestern portion of the survey area and
general surface deflation. Gravels are
present across the surface, which makes the
site area a likely lithic quarry.
Site 41ZV443 was identified entirely on the
ground surface during the centerline survey.

including lithic debitage and mussel shell
fragments at approximately 40 cmbs and no
artifacts were noted on the ground surface.
The area is heavily impacted by construction
of US Hwy 57, which cuts through the site
area. No cultural features were identified
and no buried occupational surfaces were
noted through shovel testing.

disturbance due to US Highway 57, site
41ZV455 was recommended for no further
work (Atlas 2012).
Vegetation consists of mesquite, cacti, and
scrub brush across a relatively flat area. An
unnamed drainage channel is located
approximately 185 m east of the site area,
which drains into Chaparrosa Creek. Overall
surface visibility is approximately 50–75
percent. Soil on the site consists of light
brown silty loam over solid or indurated
limestone bedrock at approximately 50
cmbs. The site measures approximately 135
m diameter based upon the previously
recorded site area and shovel test results of
the current investigation. The site is located
on either side of US Hwy 57, which has
greatly impacted contextual the integrity of
cultural material.

The lack of intact, buried deposits or cultural
features in a disturbed area leaves little to no
potential for the site to yield information
important to the prehistory of the region.
Due to its limited research value, SWCA
does not recommend site 41ZV455 as
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.
41ZV459
Site 41ZV459 is a prehistoric quarry first
identified in 2010 (Atlas 2012). As mapped,
the site stretches between FM 117 and a
transmission line corridor that the current
project parallels; approximately 1.3 km
southwest of the Leona River (HPA 3CMS9;
Appendix A.94). Previous records indicate
lithic debitage to 60 cmbs in an unspecified
number of shovel tests (possibly one) within
an area of undetermined size.

Site 41ZV455 was extended beyond the
previously recorded boundary to include a
portion of the currently proposed ROW
based on the results of shovel test CS89.
This test was positive for cultural material
including two flakes and 8–12 mussel shell
fragments at approximately 40 cmbs
(Appendix B). No diagnostic artifacts were
present, no cultural features were identified,
and no other artifacts were noted in the
project area adjacent to 41ZV455. The
material types identified in shovel test CS89
are consistent with those recorded in 2006,
although all cultural material was previously
limited to the ground surface.

Vegetation consists of dense mesquite brush
through which approximately 50 percent of
the surface was visible. Soil in the area
consists of reddish brown to brown silty
loam over compact clay or limestone
bedrock at 15–50 cmbs. Based on the results
of the current investigation, the site is not
present within the project area.

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV455 is possible Paleoindian
campsite that was expended to the north to
include a portion of the current project area.
One Angostura dart point was noted on the
2006 site form (Atlas 2012), however, no
diagnostic artifacts were identified as a
result of the current investigation. Shovel
test CS89 was positive for cultural material

Nine shovel tests (DA30–DA32, MC28–
MC30, TN26, TN28, TN29) were excavated
in the area adjacent to 41ZV459, none of

flake) was documented on an adjacent
landform (Appendix A.94).
SUMMARY

Site 41ZV459 is a previously recorded
prehistoric quarry of unspecified size that
abuts the project area within HPA 3CMS9.
Investigators did not note any cultural
material within the current project area.
Previous records state that the site is heavily
disturbed, has been destroyed, and no further
work is recommended. Due to the absence
of site 41ZV459 within the project corridor,
SWCA
recommends
no
further
investigations or avoidance for the site area.

Site 41ZV461 was identified during the
centerline survey when a variety of
prehistoric artifacts were observed on the
surface mixed with abundant natural chert
gravels and cobbles. A thorough inspection
to identify the extent of the surface artifact
scatter was conducted within the HPA and
survey corridor limits. The artifact
assemblage consists of lithic debitage (10+
secondary, 5+ tertiary), cultural shatter (6+),
three bifaces, four cores, one scrapper, one
modified flake, one untyped projectile point
and one burned rock. No diagnostic tools or
features were discovered within the survey
corridor.

41ZV461 (TN4)
Site 41ZV461 is a prehistoric lithic quarry
located in eastern Zavala County within
HPA 3CTN2. The site is situated in a
relatively flat floodplain on the east and
west bank of a tributary to the Leona River
(Appendix A.95–96).

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV461 is a prehistoric quarry of an
unknown age. The site has been heavily
impacted by land clearing. Within the
survey corridor, the assemblage is relatively
shallow in nature and non-diagnostic with
no potential to yield information important
to the prehistory of the region. Due to its
limited research value, SWCA does not
recommend site 41ZV461 as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and no further
investigations or avoidance are warranted
for the site.

The dominant vegetation includes dense
mesquite trees and prickly pear cacti,
allowing for 50 percent surface visibility.
Soils throughout the site consist of shallow
yellowish-brown to brown fine sandy loam
variably overlying reddish brown to
yellowish red basal clay at 40–50 cmbs.
Abundant chert gravels are present, and
impacts to the site include land clearing for
two-track roads, fencelines, and a
transmission line corridor to the north.

41ZV462 (TN8)
The site is roughly 30 m north–south by
1,220 m east–west, based on the distribution
of surface artifacts and survey corridor
limits. The site most likely continues outside
of the limited survey area, however, access
restrictions prevented full site boundary
delineation. A total of 28 shovel tests

survey corridor, the assemblage is relatively
shallow in nature and non-diagnostic with
no potential to yield information important
to the prehistory of the region. Due to its
limited research value, SWCA does not
recommend site 41ZV462 as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and no further
investigations or avoidance are warranted
for the site.

The dominant vegetation includes moderate
to thick mesquite trees and prickly pear cacti
within unmodified areas, allowing for 50–75
percent surface visibility. Soil consists of
brown silty loam that becomes very compact
and clayey at approximately 30–50 cmbs.
Impacts to the site include vast land clearing
for a collocated utility and road to the south
and numerous hunting clearings throughout
the site area as well as a fence and two-track
road that bisect the site.

41ZV463 (TN9)
The site is roughly 30 m north–south by 800
m east–west, based on the distribution of
surface artifacts and survey corridor limits.
The site most likely continues outside of the
limited survey area, however, access
restrictions prevented full site boundary
delineation.

Site 41ZV463 is a prehistoric campsite
located in central Zavala County within
HPA 3CTN6. The site is situated in an
upland setting with portions in the
floodplain of Tortuga Creek that bisects the
site (Appendix A.88).
The dominant vegetation includes moderate
to thick mesquite trees and prickly pear cacti
within unmodified areas, allowing for 60
percent surface visibility. Soils throughout
the site consist of yellowish-brown to brown
sandy loam to clay loam overlying brown
clay at 40–50 cmbs. Impacts to the site
include land clearing for a collocated utility
and road to the south and a hunting clearing
as well as a fence and two-track road that
bisect the site.

Site 41ZV462 was identified during the
centerline survey when a variety of
prehistoric artifacts were observed on the
surface mixed with abundant natural chert
gravels and cobbles. A thorough inspection
to identify the extent of the surface artifact
scatter was conducted within the HPA and
survey corridor limits. Seventeen shovel
tests (CS40–CS43, PB50–PB55, and
WV60–65) were excavated. Six shovel tests
(CS41, CS42, PB54, PB55, WV60, and
WV62) contained subsurface cultural
materials to a maximum depth of 50 cmbs,
however, most of this was present within the
upper 25 cmbs (Appendix B).

The site is roughly 30 m north–south by 750
m east–west, based on the distribution of
surface artifacts and survey corridor limits.
The site most likely continues outside of the
limited survey area, however, access
restrictions prevented full site boundary
delineation.

The artifact assemblage consists of lithic
debitage (30+ primary, 50+ secondary, 50+
tertiary), cultural shatter (50+), burned rock
(15+), four bifaces, two cores, and two
modified flakes. No diagnostic materials
were discovered within the survey corridor.

pending further investigation. In accordance
with this recommendation, DCP will not
impact the site and will instead bore beneath
the maximum depth of identified cultural
material for the length of the site (Figure
30). As the site is to be avoided, no further
investigations are warranted at this time.

One shovel test, SW2, encountered a
concentration of five large burned cobbles
and 25 small FCR fragments at a depth of 50
cmbs. This is interpreted as a potentially
intact cultural feature. Two burned rock
concentrations were also noted on the
ground surface within the ROW. Shovel test
SS1 was excavated directly adjacent to one
of these surface features and recovered
cultural material including burned clay, firecracked rock, and lithic debitage to a depth
of 50 cmbs, but did not encounter any intact
feature component.

41ZV486 (MS5)
Site 41ZV486 a prehistoric open campsite,
located in west-central Zavala County on the
east and west sides of a large Cambalache
Creek drainage; in HPA 3CMS18
(Appendix A.82).

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV485 is a multi-component
prehistoric open campsite with deflated
surface features, buried and intact burned
rock features, and diagnostic artifacts dating
to the Paleoindian and Late to Transitional
Archaic periods. The artifact assemblage
suggests an ephemeral campsite location
with activities including direct fire cooking
and production or retouching of formal
hunting tools (e.g., dart points). These
isolable components provide an opportunity
to extrapolate data regarding these activities
and relate it to the existing knowledge of
prehistoric inhabitation in the region. The
potential for organic preservation and the
presence of imported material provides
additional potential to learn about the range
of travel and/or trade networking and the
subsistence strategy of the groups, likely
during the Late to Transitional Archaic
period. If intact burned rock feature contexts
are further investigated, multiple forms of
more specific dating methodologies may
also be possible (e.g., radiocarbon).

Vegetation consists of mid length grass in
the creek floodplain and mesquite on the
slope to the east. The site is mainly present
on a gravelly upland landform, extending
west into an unnamed creek floodplain.
Overall surface visibility is approximately
50 percent. Soil on the site consists of a dark
brown to dark grayish brown silty clay over
brown clay.
The site area measures 280 m northwest–
southeast by 40 m northeast-southwest
based upon surface artifact distribution and
shovel test results. Disturbance on the site is
primarily attributed to a two-track roadway
at the eastern end and associated grading, as
well as erosion along the creek margin.
Site 41ZV486 was identified during the
centerline survey by pedestrian inspection of
the ground surface. A total of six shovel
tests (MS5, MS6, and TS14–TS17) were
excavated (Appendix B). Of these, four were
positive for burned rock fragments (MS6,
TS14, TS16, and TS17) to a maximum
depth of 20 cmbs. Soil cracking and
bioturbation has likely contributed to the
shallow artifact deposition.

For these reasons, SWCA concludes that site
41ZV485 has the potential to yield new and
unique information regarding prehistoric
activity in the region. SWCA therefore
recommends that the NRHP eligibility status
of site 41ZV485 is currently undetermined,
106

approximately 75 percent surface visibility
across the flat landform at the time of
survey. Soil on the site consists of a brown
to dark grayish brown clay loam that
becomes sterile and very compact with
depth. Shovel tests were terminated at 50–80
cmbs. The site area measures 150 m west–
east by 50 m north–south based upon
surface artifact distribution and shovel test
results. Disturbance on the site is primarily
attributed to erosion and previous vegetation
clearing.

The artifact assemblage is limited to lithic
debitage and burned rock, which was
primarily located on a gravelly hilltop. One
surface feature was also identified on the
west bank of the unnamed creek, eroding out
of the surface. The feature consists of
approximately 50–75 small burned rock
fragments, concentrated within a 1.5 m area
along with a few flakes (n=3+). Shovel test,
MS6 was excavated directly adjacent to the
densest portion of the feature and recovered
one burned rock fragment in the upper 10
cm. Due to the feature’s location on the edge
of a creek channel, it is heavily deflated.

Site 41ZV487 was identified during the
centerline survey through shovel testing and
pedestrian inspection of the ground surface.
A total of seven shovel tests (MS7, SS20,
SW19, SW20, and TS20–TS22) were
excavated (Appendix B). Of these, six
(MS7, SS20, SW19, and TS20–TS22) were
positive for lithic debitage (N=16), one core,
and burned rock fragments (N=11) to a
maximum depth of 40 cmbs.

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV486 is a prehistoric open campsite
with a sparse assemblage of lithic debitage,
burned rock, and a heavily deflated burned
rock feature. No diagnostic artifacts were
encountered and all artifacts were confined
to the ground surface or the upper 20 cm of
sediment.

Burned rock is fairly common across the
general area, it is unclear whether it is of
cultural origin or the result of a natural burn
event. No cultural features or temporally
diagnostic tools were encountered on the
site.

The lack of intact deposits leaves little to no
potential for the site to yield information
important to the prehistory of the region.
Due to its limited research value, SWCA
does not recommend site 41ZV486 as
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV487 is a prehistoric open campsite
with a sparse assemblage of lithic debitage
and burned rock. No diagnostic artifacts
were encountered and all artifacts were
confined to the ground surface or the upper
40 cm of sediment.

41ZV487 (MS6)
Site 41ZV487 a prehistoric open campsite,
located in west-central Zavala County
approximately 55 m west of Sand Creek, in
HPA 3CMS20 (Appendix A.84). The site
consists of a surficial and shallowly buried
scatter of lithic debitage and burned rock,
encountered to a maximum depth of 40
cmbs.

The lack of diagnostic artifacts or cultural
features and the overall paucity of cultural
material leaves little to no potential for the
site to yield information important to the
prehistory of the region. Due to its limited
research value, SWCA does not recommend

41ZV488 (MS7)
Site 41ZV488 a prehistoric campsite,
located in west-central Zavala County on the
west side of a small unnamed Nueces River
drainage. The general area is approximately
14 km south east of La Pryor, Texas in HPA
3CMS3 (Appendix A.86).

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV488 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
consisting of lithic debitage, burned rock,
and a small number of lithic tools. No
cultural features or diagnostic artifacts were
encountered and the sparse assemblage is
confined to the ground surface or the upper
30 cm of sediment.

Vegetation consists of mesquite, acacia, and
cacti across a relatively flat area. A shallow
drainage channel has meandered through the
eastern portion of the site. The site is mainly
present on the surface of a flat, gravelly
upland landform. Overall surface visibility is
approximately 50–75 percent. Soil on the
site consists of a brown to very dark grayish
brown clay loam over dark brown clay.

The lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts
or cultural features and overall paucity of
cultural material leaves little to no potential
for the site to yield information important to
the prehistory of the region. Due to its
limited research value, SWCA does not
recommend site 41ZV488 as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and no further
investigations or avoidance are warranted
for the site.

The site area measures approximately 100 m
diameter based upon surface artifact
distribution and shovel test results.
Disturbance on the site is primarily
attributed to surface deflation and the
shallow drainage channel that has
meandered and created multiple channels
through the eastern portion of the site.

41ZV489 (MS8)
Site 41ZV489 a prehistoric open campsite,
located in east-central Zavala County on the
east side of an unnamed Leona River
drainage; in HPA 3CMS6 (Appendix A.92).
The general area is approximately 11 km
south of Batesville, Texas.

Site 41ZV488 was identified during the
centerline survey through pedestrian
inspection
of
the
ground
surface
supplemented with shovel testing. A total of
six shovel tests (DA7, DA8, MC7, MC8,
TN7, and TN8) were excavated (Appendix
B). Of these, three were positive for cultural
material to a maximum depth of 30 cmbs
(DA7, TN7, and TN8). A total of four flakes
were recovered from a subsurface context
(Appendix B).

Vegetation on the site consists of mesquite,
acacia, prickly pear cactus, and sparse
grasses. The general area slopes down
slightly toward the drainage on the west side
of the site. Overall surface visibility is
approximately 70 percent. Soil on the site
consists of a strong brown to reddish brown
silt over yellowish red silty clay loam. The
site area measures 120 m west–east by 80 m
north–south based upon surface artifact
distribution and shovel test results. The site
is located to the north of an existing pipeline

The artifact assemblage consists of burned
rock, lithic debitage, one medial dart point
fragment, one biface, one modified flake,

108

and as such, any southern extension of the
site has been truncated by pipeline
construction Additional surface disturbance
is attributed to a two-track road running
north–south across the eastern portion of the
site and general surface erosion.

41ZV490 (MS9)
Site 41ZV490 is a prehistoric campsite
located in east-central Zavala County within
HPA 3CMS10 (Appendix A.95). The area is
approximately 16 km southeast of
Batesville, Texas and 1 km south of the
Leona River on a small tributary drainage.

Site 41ZV489 was identified during the
centerline survey by pedestrian inspection
and subsequent shovel testing. A total of six
shovel tests (DA18, DA19, MC17, MC18,
TN17 and TN18) were excavated (Appendix
B). Of these, one was positive for three lithic
debitage fragments in the upper 20 cmbs
(MC18). No cultural features were
identified.

Vegetation is variable within the site,
consisting of sparse mesquite and cacti on
the level terrace (west end) and dense acacia
on a gravelly hill (majority of site). Overall
surface visibility is approximately 50
percent. The surface geology varies equally,
with a fairly homogenous silty loam on the
terrace and virtually no soil on the gravelcovered hill. The site spans approximately
730 m east–west by 500 m north–south
based upon surface artifact distribution and
shovel test results (Figure 33). As indicated
by the landowner, most of the area was
previously plowed for agricultural practice.

The artifact assemblage consists of two dart
points, two quartzite hammerstones, lithic
debitage, and burned rock. The two dart
points are classified as Frio dart points,
dating to the Transitional Archaic period and
are nearly identical in size (Figure 32). The
two hammerstones were stream-rolled
quartzite cobbles with chipped portions from
percussive flaking.

A surface inspection was conducted to
identify the extent of the surface artifact
scatter beyond the survey corridor, however,
vegetation was very dense and no shovel
tests were excavated beyond the ROW limit.
A total of 11 shovel tests (DA35–DA37,
MC32–MC34 and TN32–TN35) were
excavated, four of which (DA35, DA37,
MC32, and TN33) were positive for cultural
material to a maximum depth of 35 cmbs
(Appendix B). All four of the positive
shovel tests are located on the terrace and
the western base of the hill, where soil was
present.

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV489 is a Transitional Archaic open
campsite consisting of formal tools, lithic
debitage, and burned rock. No cultural
features were encountered and all artifacts
were confined to the ground surface or the
upper 20 cm of sediment.
The lack of intact, buried deposits or cultural
features leaves little to no potential for the
site to yield information important to the
prehistory of the region. Due to its limited
research value, SWCA does not recommend
site 41ZV489 as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.

The artifact assemblage includes tested
cobbles, cores, primary lithic debitage, and
burned rock that is primarily on the surface.
Buried cultural material consists of eight
flakes, one core, and one tested cobble. The
majority of the site is defined as a quarry,
with the western portion designated as a

125 m north–south by 60 m east–west based
upon surface artifact distribution and shovel
test results. A two-track roadway bisects the
site along with a north–south running barbed
wire fenceline, near which most artifacts
were observed. In addition to surface
disturbance along the fenceline, there is a
transmission line crossing the northern
portion of the site and several push piles in
the area.

lithic debitage and burned rock. However,
this level area was likely farmed until the
recent past, relegating the integrity of
artifacts located within the plow zone. No
temporally diagnostic artifacts or cultural
features were identified within the site area.
SUMMARY

Site 41ZV490 is a prehistoric campsite with
two distinct areas. Most of the site consists
of a surficial scatter at the source of raw
lithic material. The west end of the site
contains lithic debitage and burned rock in a
previously plowed area. No diagnostic
artifacts or cultural features were present
and the sparse buried material is within a
disturbed context.

A thorough surface inspection was
conducted to identify the extent of the
surface artifact scatter, however, no shovel
tests were excavated beyond the ROW limit.
Site 41ZV491 was identified primarily on
the ground surface during the centerline
survey. A total of five shovel tests (DA40–
DA42, MS35, and TN37) were excavated on
the site, one of which (MC35) was positive
for cultural material to a maximum depth of
70 cmbs (Appendix B). Based on the visible
level of disturbance in the area due to
clearing,
utilities,
and
fenceline
maintenance, it is likely that the buried
material is within a disturbed context.

The lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts
or cultural features leaves little to no
potential for the site to yield information
important to the prehistory of the region.
Due to its limited research value, SWCA
does not recommend site 41ZV490 as
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.

Artifacts observed both on the surface and in
shovel test MC35 consist of lithic debitage,
one biface fragment and a small amount of
burned rock. Cultural material encountered
in shovel test MC35 consists of 29 flakes
and one burned rock fragment. One biface
fragment was also documented on the
ground surface near a barbed wire fenceline,
which was the only tool observed. No
diagnostic artifacts or cultural features were
identified within the site area.

41ZV491 (MS10)
Site 41ZV491 is a prehistoric campsite
located in eastern Zavala County within
HPA 3CMS11. The site is situated on the
west side of an unnamed drainage, mainly to
the south of an existing transmission line.
The site is approximately 1 km south of the
Leona River and 600 m east of site
41ZV490 (Appendix A.95).

SUMMARY

Vegetation consists of mesquite scrub and
cacti and the overall surface visibility is
approximately 70 percent. The ground
surface is sandy, with very few gravels. The
observed soils include fine sandy loam over
sterile clay loam at depths ranging between

including clearing, fenceline construction
and maintenance, and utilities installation
and maintenance has occurred at the site.
The high level of disturbance, lack of intact
deposits, diagnostic artifacts, or cultural
features leaves little to no potential for the
site to yield information important to the
prehistory of the region. Due to its limited
research value, SWCA does not recommend
site 41ZV491 as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.

The artifact assemblage consists of
secondary and tertiary flake fragments with
approximately four non-diagnostic, crude
tool fragments. The surface scatter is sparse
and a total of 12 chert flake fragments were
recovered from the six positive shovel tests.
No cultural features were identified within
the site area.

41ZV492 (MS11)
Site 41ZV492 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
located in eastern central Zavala County
within HPA 3CMS11. The site is situated on
a sparsely vegetated and gently undulating
landform between two ephemeral Leona
River tributary drainages that flow to the
northeast (Appendix A.95).

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV492 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
with relatively shallow sandy soil over
sterile clay subsoil. No cultural features or
diagnostic artifacts were identified and
surficial material is sparse. Cultural material
present been impacted by modern activity
such as transmission line construction and
land clearing.

Vegetation consists of mesquite scrub and
cacti with many open areas and the overall
surface visibility is approximately 70
percent. The ground surface is sandy with
many small, stream rolled gravels. Soil
consists of dark brown sandy loam over
reddish clay at a depth of approximately 40
cmbs. The site spans approximately 200 m
north–south by 250 m east–west based upon
surface artifact distribution and shovel test
results. A transmission line traverses the
southwestern portion of the site and a twotrack road clearing crosses the site area from
east to west. Due to the surficial nature of
the site, any clearing activity has
significantly compromised the contextual
integrity of cultural material.

The heavy surface disturbance, lack of intact
deposits, cultural features, or diagnostic
artifacts leaves little to no potential for the
site to yield information important to the
prehistory of the region. Due to its limited
research value, SWCA does not recommend
site 41ZV492 as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.
41ZV493 (MS21/22)

Site 41ZV492 was identified on the ground
surface with additional material recovered
from shovel tests excavated across the site.
A thorough surface inspection was

Site 41ZV493 is a prehistoric open camp
located in eastern Zavala County within
HPA 3CMS45. The site is situated roughly
670 m south of the Leona River in a
113

generally flat area traversed by minor
tributary drainages (Appendix A.96–97).

Diagnostic artifacts indicate activity from
the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.

Vegetation consists of mesquite, juniper and
live oak trees, various cacti, and short,
patchy grass, which affords less than 50
percent surface visibility across the site. The
ground surface is sandy and small stream
rolled gravels or cobbles are more prevalent
near the erosional drainage channels. Soil
consists of occasionally flooded sandy clay
loam that was typically terminated at
approximately 60 cmbs due to sterile and
compact soil. The site spans approximately
30 m north–south by 2,200 m east–west
based upon surface artifact distribution,
shovel test results, and the project area
boundary. A two-track fenceline road and
three pipeline corridors traverse the site and
have contributed to disturbance in these
areas, however, the site is largely
undisturbed.

The lack of intact deposits or cultural
features leaves little to no potential for the
site to yield information important to the
prehistory of the region. Due to its limited
research value, SWCA does not recommend
site 41ZV493 as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.

Site 41ZV493 was identified primarily on
the ground surface during the centerline
survey. A total of 38 shovel tests (AY52,
CS76, DR178–188, PB, 97, PB98, TS189–
202, WV109, and WV110) were excavated,
five of which (CS76, DR182, DR184,
TS195, and TS197) were positive for
cultural material to a maximum depth of 60
cmbs (Appendix B).

Vegetation in the area of the scatter consists
of low mesquite scrub and cacti, which
affords approximately 50–80 percent surface
visibility. Soil at the surface consists of silty
clay loam with very few gravels. Shovel
tests were terminated at approximately 40–
65 cm, at which point sterile and very
compact clay was encountered. The site
measures approximately 55 m northeast–
southwest by 110 m northwest–southeast
based upon surface artifact distribution and
shovel test results. No significant
disturbance was noted aside from natural
surface erosion.

41ZV494 (KL1)
Site 41ZV494 is a prehistoric lithic scatter,
identified on the west side of a small,
unnamed drainage in western Zavala
County, HPA 3CKL4. The site is located on
a fairly level landform where ephemeral
drainages feed into Chaparrosa Creek and
ultimately the Nueces River (Appendix
A.79).

The artifact assemblage includes one late
Prehistoric Scallorn arrow point, one
Archaic Refugio-like dart point, a few biface
fragments, lithic debitage, and burned rock
(Figure 34). Buried cultural material consists
of 12 flakes, three burned rock fragments,
and one charcoal fragment. No cultural
features were identified within the site area.

Site 41ZV494 is sparse and was primarily
identified on the ground surface during the
centerline survey. A total of six shovel tests
(DR217, DR218, KL31, KL32, PB163, and
TS218) were excavated, three of which were
positive for cultural material to a maximum
depth of 30 cmbs (DR218, PB163, and
TS218; Appendix B). Due to ROW

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV493 is a large and diffuse open
campsite with primarily surficial cultural
material and no identified cultural features.

restrictions, inspection was restricted to the
ROW.

Vegetation consists of mesquite and cacti
with many open areas and the overall
surface visibility is approximately 50–80
percent. Soil at the surface consists of silty
clay with very few gravels. Shovel tests
terminated at 35–50 cmbs due to sterile and
very compact soil with increasing clay
content. Based upon surface artifact
distribution and shovel test results, the site
area is approximately 100 m diameter. Push
piles from two-track road clearing are
present within the site area.

Artifacts include approximately 5–10
primary flakes, 15–30 tertiary flakes, one
biface fragment, one complete biface, and
burned rock fragments. No concentrations of
burned rock are present that might indicate
specific activity areas or feature remnants.
Buried cultural material consists of a total of
three tertiary flakes. No cultural features
were identified and no temporally diagnostic
artifacts were observed.

Site 41ZV495 was identified almost
exclusively on the ground surface during the
centerline survey. A total of three shovel
tests (DR220, PB165, and TS220) were
excavated, one of which (DR220) was
positive for one tertiary flake at a depth of
10–20 cmbs (Appendix B). No cultural
features were identified within the site area.

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV494 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
that was primarily limited to the ground
surface. Overall, a small amount of lithic
debitage, burned rock, and two bifacial tools
were noted, with no diagnostic tools or
cultural features. As no diagnostic material
was present, no temporal association can be
assigned to the site.

Artifacts include one Transitional Archaic
Figueroa-like dart point, six non-diagnostic
bifaces, lithic debitage, and burned rock.
Cultural material is primarily surficial and
may represent mixed temporal periods.

The lack of intact deposits or cultural
features and overall paucity of cultural
material, leaves little to no potential for the
site to yield information important to the
prehistory of the region. Due to its limited
research value, SWCA does not recommend
site 41ZV494 as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV495 is a Transitional Archaic open
campsite with shallow, gravelly soil, no
identified cultural features, and very little
buried cultural material.
The lack of intact deposits or cultural
features in a heavily disturbed context leaves
little to no potential for the site to yield
information important to the prehistory of
the region. Due to its limited research value,
SWCA does not recommend site 41ZV495
as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no
further investigations or avoidance are
warranted for the site.

41ZV495 (KL2)
Site 41ZV495 is a Transitional Archaic open
campsite located in western Zavala County
within HPA 3CKL4. The site is situated
within a fairly level landscape, on the east
side of a small upland drainage that
eventually feeds into Chaparrosa Creek
(Appendix A.79). Site 41ZV494 is located
approximately 200 m northwest.

116

14 flakes, one mussel shell fragment, and
approximately 40 burned rock fragments.
No diagnostic artifacts or cultural features
were encountered and no cultural
stratification was observed.

41ZV496 (VV2)
Site 41ZV496 a prehistoric campsite,
located in northwestern Zavala County near
the confluence of Turkey Creek and
Maverick Creek, within HPA 3CVV2
(Appendix A.78; Figure 35).

SUMMARY

Site 41ZV496 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
consisting of lithic debitage and burned rock
dispersed over a broad area. No lithic tools,
cultural features, or diagnostic artifacts were
encountered and all artifacts were confined
to the ground surface or the upper 40 cm of
sediment.

Vegetation consists of mesquite, cacti, and
scrub brush across a relatively flat area. The
channels of Turkey Creek (through the
center of the site) and Maverick Creek
(western site boundary) are incised
approximately 1.5 m within the project area.
Overall surface visibility is approximately
60–65 percent. Soil on the site consists of a
brown to dark grayish brown silty clay loam
over very dark grayish brown clay at a depth
of 30–60 cmbs. The site area measures
approximately 400 m northwest–southeast
by 120 m northeast–southwest based upon
surface artifact distribution and shovel test
results. Disturbance on the site is attributed
to surface deflation and clearing activity
related to a two-track road that cuts through
the site. An agricultural field is located
immediately north of the project area, which
has likely disturbed any northward extension
of the site.

The lack of temporally diagnostic tools or
cultural features in a heavily disturbed area
leaves little to no potential for the site to
yield information important to the prehistory
of the region. Due to its limited research
value, SWCA does not recommend site
41ZV496 as eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and no further investigations or
avoidance are warranted for the site.
41ZV497 (VV1)
Site 41ZV497 is a prehistoric open
campsite, located in northwestern Zavala
County, north of US 57 highway and west of
Chaparrosa Creek; within HPA 3CVV1
(Appendix A.76).

Site 41ZV496 was identified during the
centerline survey through pedestrian
inspection
of
the
ground
surface
supplemented with shovel testing. A total of
18 shovel tests (CS94–CS97, CS107, ID12–
ID17, LK13–LK17, PB172, and TS227)
were excavated (Appendix B). Of these,
nine (CS94, CS97, ID13, ID14, ID16,
LK13–LK15, and PB172) were positive for
cultural material to a maximum depth of 40
cmbs.

Vegetation consists of mesquite, cacti, and
low
scrub
brush,
which
afforded
approximately 50–75 percent surface
visibility across the generally flat landform
at the time of survey. Soil on the site
consists of a brown to light brown silty clay
that becomes sterile and very compact with
depth. The site area measures 1,020 m east–
west by 50 m north–south based upon
surface artifact distribution, shovel test
results, and the limits of the current project
area (Figure 36). Disturbance on the site is
primarily attributed to construction of the

The artifact assemblage consists of lithic
debitage, burned rock, and a few mussel
shell fragments, primarily scattered across
the surface. Buried cultural material includes

all artifacts were identified within the upper
60 cm of sediment.

Site 41ZV497 was identified during the
centerline survey through shovel testing and
pedestrian inspection of the ground surface.
A total of 22 shovel tests (CS83–CS88,
ID1–ID7, LK1–LK8, and TS208) were
excavated (Appendix B). Of these, eight
(CS85, CS87, CS88, ID2, ID3, ID6, LK4,
and LK5) were positive for lithic debitage
and burned rock fragments to a maximum
depth of 60 cmbs.

The lack of diagnostic artifacts, cultural
stratification, and overall diffuse nature of
cultural material leaves little to no potential
for the site to yield information important to
the prehistory of the region. Due to its
limited research value, SWCA does not
recommend site 41ZV497 as eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and no further
investigations or avoidance are warranted
for the site.

The artifact assemblage, although primarily
comprised of lithic debitage and burned
rock, includes one mano fragment, a dart
point fragment, one core, and a unifacial
tool. Tools indicate a variety of cultural
activities, including food processing and
lithic reduction. Buried debitage was
uniformly present across the site, however,
relatively sparse and potentially the result of
natural processes, such as bioturbation and
vertical movement through cracks in the
soil.

ISOLATED FINDS (IFS)
A total of 28 IFs were identified during the
investigations of Phase IIIC (Table 3). As
the designation implies, IFs are isolated
artifacts, which did not contain sufficient
data to warrant designation as an
archaeological site. Generally, an IF
designation was given to any discrete
location within the ROW that contained less
than three artifacts. Subsequent shovel tests
and intensive pedestrian inspection in all
instances failed to produce additional
cultural material. IFs were encountered in all
environmental and topographic settings
within the IIIC alignment and are indicated
on the IIIC Results Maps (Appendix A.1–
107).

Two concentrations of burned rock were
also noted on the ground surface that may be
deflated cultural features. Each of these
potential features consisted of burned rock
scattered across the ground surface within an
approximately 3 m area. Nearby shovel tests
revealed a limited amount of cultural
material and no indication of a buried
feature context. No temporally diagnostic
artifacts were encountered and no intact,
cultural stratification was indicated through
shovel testing.

Overall, the IFs fall into three general
categories: chipped stone tools, chert
debitage, and historic features. Of these
three categories, the large majority of IFs
(n=22) are chipped stone tools. Within this
generic category, investigators documented
8 dart points or dart point fragments, 2
scrappers, 2 chert cores, 1 graver, 1
groundstone metate, and 8 miscellaneous
bifacial tools or bifacial tool fragments. In
both instances where isolated chert cores
were documented, one or two flakes were
present on the surface as well. Four

Site 41ZV497 is a prehistoric open campsite
with a large scatter of tools, lithic debitage
and burned rock. No diagnostic artifacts or
intact cultural features were encountered and

maintenance activities, as well as a long
history of agriculture modification. Within
the 79.2 miles (127.5 km) of designated
HPAs, 27 backhoe trench excavations and
1,483 shovel test excavations were
conducted. The shovel tests account for 18.7
shovel tests per mile or one every 86 m.
These excavation intervals exceed those
typically recommended by the THC, which
are 16 shovel tests per mile or one every 100
m. Of those 1,483 shovel tests, 218 (15
percent) were positive for cultural materials.

additional IF locations consisted of 1–3
flakes only. The remaining two IFs are
historic features: one steel well pipe and one
wooden feed trough.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of DCP, SWCA conducted an
intensive archaeological survey of portions
of the 198-mile-long Sand Hills IIIC
Pipeline Project. The alignment begins near
the City of Derby, Texas in Frio County
crossing Zavala, Maverick, Kinney, and
Edwards counties before terminating at the
Sonora Gas Plant near Sonora, Texas in
Sutton County.

The IIIC archaeological investigations
documented 44 new prehistoric sites
(41ED265–41ED271,
41FR70–41FR72,
41FR90–41FR96, 41KY158, 41KY159,
41KY172–175,
41MV367–41MV371,
41ZV461–41ZV463,
and
41ZV485–
41ZV497) and an assortment of isolated
prehistoric artifacts. Seven previously
recorded archaeological sites (41ED14,
41KY160, 41ZV96, 41ZV181, 41ZV443,
41ZV455 and 41ZV459) were also revisited
during the field effort. Due to a variety of
factors, including a lack of unique
characteristics or contextual integrity, 45 of
these resources (41ED14, 41ED265–
41ED271, 41FR71, 41FR72, 41FR90–41FR93, 41FR95, 41FR96, 41KY159,
41KY160,
41KY172–175,
41MV367–
41MV371, 41ZV181, 41ZV443, 41ZV455,
41ZV461–41ZV463,
and
41ZV486–
41ZV497) are not recommended as eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP. However, four
archaeological sites (41FR70, 41FR94,
41KY158, and 41ZV485) are recommended
as potentially significant and warrant
avoidance or further investigation. DCP has
elected to avoid these potentially significant
resources through HDD (i.e., boring)
measures.
Archaeological
significance
testing was conducted at 41FR70 with
portions of the site considered eligible for
listing on the NRHP under Criterion D
(Lawrence et al. 2012). These significant

SWCA’s
investigations
included
a
background literature and records review
and an intensive pedestrian survey with
shovel testing and backhoe trenching to
systematically identify, record, delineate,
and, if possible, determine the significance
of any cultural resources located within the
project area.
The background literature review revealed
that three linear and three area
archaeological investigations have been
conducted within a 1-mile (1.6 km) radius of
the project area and 74 previously recorded
archeological sites, one historic marker and
one cemetery are located within a mile of
the project area. Of these, three linear and
one survey directly intersect the proposed
centerline and eight archaeological sites,
41ED14, 41KY160, 41MV99, 41ZV96,
41ZV181,
41ZV443,
41ZV455
and
41ZV459, are within 100 m of the proposed
centerline.
Overall, investigations in the IIIC project
corridor encountered a rural setting with a
mix of disturbed and undisturbed areas.
Various disturbances primarily are the result
of prior pipeline construction and

121

portions on 41FR70 will be avoided via
HDD.
In accordance with Section 106, 36 CFR
800.4 of the NHPA, SWCA has made a
reasonable and good faith effort to identify
archaeological and historic properties within
the investigated project area. Based on the
survey findings and DCP’s avoidance
measures, no significant or potentially
significant cultural resources will be
adversely affected by the proposed project.
Consequently, SWCA recommends no
further archaeological investigations within
the investigated portions of the project area
and that the project be allowed to proceed.
