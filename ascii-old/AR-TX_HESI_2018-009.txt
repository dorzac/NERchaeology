Projects on General Land Office Property in Reeves County, Texas

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the 2017 calendar year, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted intensive cultural resources surveys for 30 proposed Anadarko Petroleum
Corporation (Anadarko) projects located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office
(GLO) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Areas). These projects included well pads, access
roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs). All 30 projects were privately funded and did not
require any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the GLO is considered to be a
political subdivision of the State of Texas, the portions of the 30 projects on GLO property all fell
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton
Group, Inc. (Whitenton), Horizon conducted the cultural resources surveys of the Project Areas
on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the surveys was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the 30 Project Areas and, if any existed,
to determine if the projects had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered
eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The cultural resources
surveys were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
The cultural resources surveys of the 30 Project Areas resulted in the documentation of
3 new archeological sites (41RV116, 41RV119, and 41RV120). Site 41RV116 was documented
as a moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter on a small rise to the north of Halamicek Draw
within Anadarko’s Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROW project. The presence
of early-stage lithic reduction debris on the site, coupled with the lack of formal tools, features,
or fire-cracked rock (FCR), suggests that the site functioned as a lithic procurement area rather
than a campsite. Based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; (2) the lack
of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic materials on
the site, it was Horizon’s opinion that site 41RV116 was ineligible for formal designation as a
SAL. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations were warranted
on site 41RV116 in connection with the Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROW
project. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred with this assessment on 16 May
2017.
Site 41RV119 was documented as a moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter within a
generally featureless desert upland to the south of a tributary of Smith Draw within Anadarko’s
Mako State 2-34 Frac Pond to Laramie 55-4-7 Frac Pond Water Transfer Pipeline ROW project.

tools, features, or FCR, suggests that the site functioned as a lithic procurement area rather
than a campsite. Based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; (2) the lack
of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic materials on
the site, it was Horizon’s opinion that site 41RV119 was ineligible for formal designation as a
SAL. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations were warranted
on site 41RV119 in connection with the Mako State 2-34 Frac Pond to Laramie 55-4-7 Frac
Pond Water Transfer Pipeline ROW project. The THC concurred with this assessment on 6
June 2017.
Finally, site 41RV120 was documented as a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter on the
gradual slope of a small rise to the northwest of Horsehead Draw within Anadarko’s Reeves Oil
Pipeline Phase I and Block 56 (Area B) to Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROW
project. The presence of early-stage lithic reduction debris on the site, coupled with the lack of
formal tools, features, or FCR, suggests that the site functioned as a lithic procurement area
rather than a campsite. Based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; (2)
the lack of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic
materials on the site, it was Horizon’s opinion that site 41RV120 was ineligible for formal
designation as a SAL. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations
were warranted on site 41RV119 in connection with the Reeves Oil Pipeline Phase I and Block
56 (Area B) to Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROW project. The THC
concurred with the site assessment and Avoidance Plan on 26 July 2017.
The cultural resources surveys conducted on the remaining 27 projects all produced
negative results. Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the
construction of the remaining 27 projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. The THC concurred with these recommendations.

Projects on General Land Office Property in Reeves County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of intensive cultural resources surveys conducted
during the 2017 calendar year for 30 proposed Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko)
projects located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO) in Reeves County,
Texas (Project Areas) (Figure 1-1). All 30 projects were privately funded and did not require
any federal permitting or coordination. However, as the GLO is considered to be a political
subdivision of the State, the portions of the 30 projects on GLO property fell under the
regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). At the request of Whitenton Group, Inc.
(Whitenton), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources
survey of the Project Areas on behalf of Anadarko in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of
the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the 30 Project Areas
and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on
sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The
cultural resources surveys were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual
permit number 7883.
The 30 Anadarko projects assessed by Horizon in 2017 included well pads, surface sites
access roads, and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) that were located in whole or in part on tracts
of land owned by the GLO. Only the portions of each project situated on GLO land were
assessed under TAC annual permit number 7883. These included the entirety of certain
projects and only portions of others. Each of the 30 projects is listed in Table 1-1, along with its
map identifier in Figure 1-1. The individual interim reports prepared for each project, as well as
the individual responses from the Texas Historical Commission (THC), are presented in
Appendix A.
The cultural resources investigations for each of the 30 projects consisted of an initial
archival review, an intensive cultural resources survey of each Project Area, the production of
interim reports submitted for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), and the
production of a final report for review by the SHPO in accordance with the THC’s Rules of
Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural
resources director) served as the project’s principal investigator, while Jacob Lyons, Briana
Smith, Jared Wiersema, Stephanie Mueller, and Benjamin Johnson conducted the field
investigations at various times in 2017.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The cultural resources surveys of the 30 Project Areas resulted in the documentation of
3 new archeological sites (41RV116, 41RV119, and 41RV120). Site 41RV116 was documented
as a moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter on a small rise to the north of Halamicek Draw
within Anadarko’s Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROW project. The presence
of early-stage lithic reduction debris on the site, coupled with the lack of formal tools, features,
or fire-cracked rock (FCR), suggests that the site functioned as a lithic procurement area rather
than a campsite. Based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; (2) the lack
of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic materials on
the site, it was Horizon’s opinion that site 41RV116 was ineligible for formal designation as a
SAL. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations were warranted
on site 41RV116 in connection with the Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROW
project. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred with this assessment on 16 May
2017.
Site 41RV119 was documented as a moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter within a
generally featureless desert upland to the south of a tributary of Smith Draw within Anadarko’s
Mako State 2-34 Frac Pond to Laramie 55-4-7 Frac Pond Water Transfer Pipeline ROW project.
The presence of early-stage lithic reduction debris on the site, coupled with the lack of formal
tools, features, or FCR, suggests that the site functioned as a lithic procurement area rather

of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic materials on
the site, it was Horizon’s opinion that site 41RV119 was ineligible for formal designation as a
SAL. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations were warranted
on site 41RV119 in connection with the Mako State 2-34 Frac Pond to Laramie 55-4-7 Frac
Pond Water Transfer Pipeline ROW project. The THC concurred with this assessment on 6
June 2017.
Finally, site 41RV120 was documented as a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter on the
gradual slope of a small rise to the northwest of Horsehead Draw within Anadarko’s Reeves Oil
Pipeline Phase I and Block 56 (Area B) to Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROW

concurred with the site assessment and Avoidance Plan on 26 July 2017.
The cultural resources surveys conducted on the remaining 27 projects all produced
negative results. Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the
construction of the remaining 27 projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects

relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the
THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery. The THC concurred with these
recommendations.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The 30 Anadarko projects on GLO land that were assessed in 2017 are all located in
northwestern and north-central Reeves County, Texas. Roughly a third are located in the
vicinity of Orla, Texas, and can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Orla,
Orla SE, Threemile Draw, and Screw Bean Draw East, Texas, topographic quadrangle maps.
The majority are located west, southwest, and south of Mentone, Texas, on the USGS 7.5minute Narrow Bow Draw, Anderson Ranch, Halamicek Ranch, Mentone SW, and Sand Lake,
Texas, topographic quadrangle maps (see Figure 1-1; also see individual interim reports in
Appendix A). The 30 projects include 23 pipeline/flowline ROWs, 3 well pads with associated
access road ROWs, and 4 surface sites. Each of these 30 projects is summarized in Table 2-1.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The 30 Project Areas are located within desert settings in West Texas. They are
typically found in relatively flat to gently undulating desert hills that are dissected by a variety of
drainages and draws, including Arroyo Bonito, Horsehead Draw, Smith Draw, Halamicek Draw,
and tributaries of the Pecos River. Representative images of the Project Areas are presented in
Figures 2-1 through 2-4.
Hydrologically, all 30 of the Project Areas are situated within the Pecos River basin. All
are located to the west or southwest of the Pecos River and are drained to the east or northeast
by the various water channels listed above.

2.3

CLIMATE

Winters in Reeves County are generally cool, with an average temperature of
46.0 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). The summer months are hot, with an average temperature of
83.0°F. The average annual total precipitation is about 8.6 inches (21.8 centimeters [cm]), with
roughly 70% of it falling between April and September (NRCS 1980).

FLORA AND FAUNA

The 30 Project Areas are located in the Chihuahuan Biotic Province, which includes all
of Trans-Pecos Texas except for the Guadalupe Mountains (Blair 1950).
Blair notes that
portions of Culberson and the surrounding counties were once part of an old bolson now
drained by the Pecos River. Also located within the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas of the
Chihuahuan Deserts ecoregion, the Project Areas are situated on geologic formations
comprising sand sheet and caliche deposits (Griffith et al. 2007). Three native plant
communities dominate the Chihuahuan Basins and Playas: saline flats and alkaline playa
margins, gypsum land, and desert shrubland. The dominant species associated with the saline
flats and alkaline playa margins plant community include fourwing saltbush (Atriplex
canescens), seepweed (Suaeda spp.), pickleweed (Salicornia spp.), and alkali sacaton
(Sporobolus airoides). The dominant species associated with the gypsum land plant community
include gypsum grama (Bouteloua breviseta), blazingstar (Mentzelia spp.), and Torrey’s jointfir
(Ephedra torreyana). The dominant species associated with the desert shrubland plant
community include creosote bush (Larrea tridentate), American tarwort (Flourensia cernua),
yucca (Yucca spp.), sand sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia), blackbrush (Acacia rigidula), Christmas
cactus (Cylindropuntia leptocaulis), lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), and cenizo (Leucophyllum
frutescens) (Griffith et al. 2007).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1999).
This temporal framework, consisting of a tri-partite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies, is broken down into 3 main periods: PaleoIndian (pre-8500 B.P.),
Archaic (8500 to 1250 B.P.), and Late Prehistoric (1250 to 250 B.P.). The Archaic period is
further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 6000 B.P.), the Middle Archaic (6000 B.P. to
3500 B.P.), and the Late Archaic (3500 to 1250 B.P.) subperiods.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN (PRE-8500 B.P.)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna, such as mammoth and bison, are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet as well. Based
upon the low number of diagnostic artifacts recovered from sites of this period, as well as the
low frequency of sites, population densities are considered low and probably consisted of small
family groups. An increase in projectile point frequency toward the end of the period may
suggest an increased population density or, perhaps, an increase in macro-band aggregation
for the purpose of communal hunts. Sites from this time period are found mostly in upland
tributary and spring settings, as well as deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Clovis and Folsom
points are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, while Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff,
Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points are characteristic of the later span of
the period.

3.2

EARLY ARCHAIC (8500 TO 6000 B.P.)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. However, a more generalized hunting-and-gathering strategy
is evidenced by the use of river mussels. Early Archaic sites are typically located on terraces
along tributary watercourses, but are also often found deeply buried in floodplain alluvium. Site
locale and an increased use of river mussels possibly indicate a shift in subsistence strategies

HJN 160006 AR 74

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

in order to exploit the bottomlands of major waterways during this period of wetter climates.
Split-stemmed points such as Gower, Martindale, and Uvalde, as well as Big Sandy, Hardin,
and Hoxie, are diagnostic of Early Archaic occupations.

3.3

MIDDLE ARCHAIC (6000 TO 3500 B.P.)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend to bottomland exploitation increased, with fewer
sites found along minor tributaries. Population density remained relatively low, but obviously
increased over prior periods with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented at larger
sites where food sources were more abundant.

3.4

LATE ARCHAIC (3500 TO 1250 B.P.)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. Subsistence was focused on hunting and gathering within the
bottomlands of major creeks and rivers. Deer remains are quite common at Late Archaic sites,
and the exploitation of plant foods (nuts) seems to have increased during this period, based
upon an increase in plant-processing tools. Late Archaic sites are typically found on sandy
terraces along tributaries as well as on clayey floodplains.

3.5

LATE PREHISTORIC (1250 TO 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow, as
well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and
other small game. Horticulture also became evident in some areas. As in the Late Archaic,
sites continue to be located on sandy terraces along major creeks and rivers. In fact, the
majority of Late Prehistoric sites contain some traces of Late Archaic occupations. A marked
population increase is evident, and increased territorial conflicts possibly explain the recovery of
burials with indications of violent deaths. Furthermore, differentiated burial practices also
suggest the development of non-egalitarian societies.

3.6

HISTORIC (250 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The history of Reeves County is not well documented, due to its remoteness and low
population. The Antonio de Espejo expedition was one of the first Spanish expeditions to cross
into West Texas. According to Smith (2017), this expedition encountered a group of 3 Jumano
Indians near Toyah Lake in eastern Reeves County in 1853. The Jumanos are said to have
irrigated crops of peaches and corn near Balmorhea (Smith 2017). Later visitors to the region
noted groups of Mescalero Indians growing corn along Toyah Creek. It wasn’t until the 1870s
that the first Anglo farmers and ranchers began to settle the area.
Named for Confederate colonel George R. Reeves, Reeves County separated from
Pecos County in 1883 and was organized 1884. Around the turn of the 20th century, state law
permitted sale of school lands in West Texas. This led to a rush of new settlers in the region.
By 1910, the population of the county had doubled to 4,392, with most residents living in the
numerous small towns that had sprung up, including Orla and Balmorhea, which were the only

2 towns with remaining post offices in the 1990s (Smith 2017). The 1920s and 1930s saw the
expansion of oil exploration in the region, and the population increased to 6,407 residents. By
the 1990s, the Reeves County economy was primarily based on oil and agriculture. In the early
2000s, the population had increased to 14,349.

4.0 METHODOLOGY

4.1

DATABASE AND MAP REVIEW

Prior to all field survey efforts, a Horizon archeologist conducted archival research via
the Internet on the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) website and via the National
Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer to
ascertain the number, type, and significance of any previously recorded archeological sites,
cemeteries, and historic properties within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of each of the 30 Project
Areas. Given the remoteness of the Project Areas and the general lack of prior surveys in the
area, most of the 30 Project Areas had no documented cultural resources within the 1.0-mile
(1.6 km) review perimeters. The results of the archival research conducted for each of the
30 projects are presented within the associated interim reports in Appendix A.

4.2

FIELD METHODS

A 2- to 4-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed each of the 30 separate
Project Areas at various times in 2017. The survey efforts typically entailed intensive surface
inspection and subsurface shovel testing within each Project Area. For projects between
3.0 and 10.0 acres in size, which included most of the well pads, the Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre. For
linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) wide, which included all of the assessed
pipeline and access road ROWs, the TSMASS require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile.
Horizon met or exceeded the TSMASS on all of the 30 Project Areas. The number of shovel
tests excavated within each Project Area are presented in Table 4-1. The specific methodology
for each of the 30 projects is presented within the associated interim reports in Appendix A. All
excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or
were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
For each project, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
shovel tests, and cultural materials observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms were
completed for every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and
notations on any artifacts encountered. For any new archeological sites recorded, standard site
forms were completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) for
permanent housing. Similarly, for any previously recorded archeological sites that were
assessed, updated site forms were completed and filed at the TARL.

Projects on General Land Office Property in Reeves County, Texas

A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated and assessed in the field and placed back where
they were found. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. The
locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld global positioning system (GPS) units
utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American
Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations and shovel test data are presented within the
associated interim reports in Appendix A.

5.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The cultural resources survey of the 30 Project Areas resulted in the documentation of
3 new archeological sites (41RV116, 41RV119, and 41RV120). The results for each of the
30 separate Project Areas are summarized in Table 5-1. Formal site descriptions, maps, and
other relevant data are presented within the individual interim reports prepared for each of the
30 projects in Appendix A.
Site 41RV116 was documented as a moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter on a
small rise to the north of Halamicek Draw within Anadarko’s Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and
SWD Pipeline ROW project. The presence of early-stage lithic reduction debris on the site,
coupled with the lack of formal tools, features, or FCR, suggests that the site functioned as a
lithic procurement area rather than a campsite. Based on (1) the surficial nature of the
observed cultural deposits; (2) the lack of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the lack of
any temporally diagnostic materials on the site, it was Horizon’s opinion that site 41RV116 was
ineligible for formal designation as a SAL. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no
additional investigations were warranted on site 41RV116 in connection with the Block 55 (Area
C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROW project. The Texas Historical Commission (THC)
concurred with this assessment on 16 May 2017.
Site 41RV119 was documented as a moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter within a
generally featureless desert upland to the south of a tributary of Smith Draw within Anadarko’s
Mako State 2-34 Frac Pond to Laramie 55-4-7 Frac Pond Water Transfer Pipeline ROW project.
The presence of early-stage lithic reduction debris on the site, coupled with the lack of formal
tools, features, or FCR, suggests that the site functioned as a lithic procurement area rather
than a campsite. Based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; (2) the lack
of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic materials on
the site, it was Horizon’s opinion that site 41RV119 was ineligible for formal designation as a
SAL. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations were warranted
on site 41RV119 in connection with the Mako State 2-34 Frac Pond to Laramie 55-4-7 Frac
Pond Water Transfer Pipeline ROW project. The THC concurred with this assessment on 6
June 2017.

Finally, site 41RV120 was documented as a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter on the
gradual slope of a small rise to the northwest of Horsehead Draw within Anadarko’s Reeves Oil
Pipeline Phase I and Block 56 (Area B) to Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROW
project. The presence of early-stage lithic reduction debris on the site, coupled with the lack of
formal tools, features, or FCR, suggests that the site functioned as a lithic procurement area
rather than a campsite. Based on (1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; (2)
the lack of buried, stratified cultural deposits; and (3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic
materials on the site, it was Horizon’s opinion that site 41RV120 was ineligible for formal
designation as a SAL. With this in mind, Horizon recommended that no additional investigations
were warranted on site 41RV119 in connection with the Reeves Oil Pipeline Phase I and Block
56 (Area B) to Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROW project. The THC
concurred with the site assessment and Avoidance Plan on 26 July 2017.
The cultural resources surveys conducted on the remaining 27 projects all produced
negative results. Based on the negative survey results, it was Horizon’s opinion that the
construction of the remaining 27 projects would have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommended that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the construction of these projects
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials

(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the various Project Areas, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the
THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery. The THC concurred with these
recommendations.

Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 33

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Sievers A Unit 3H
Flowline right-of-way (ROW) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area) (Figures 1 to 4). The
development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, it is located on property
owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political
subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the
Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the
project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources
investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 4.9 miles (9.5 kilometers [km])
south of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Sand Lake, Texas topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a pipeline ROW
that measures approximately 1.2 miles (1.9 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 meters [m]) wide
(approximately 4.2 acres). It is located entirely on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Internet at the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s)
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project
Area (THC 2016). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2016). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is the Lara Cemetery (RV-C005).
This small family cemetery is located approximately 4.1 miles (6.6 km) southeast of the Project
Area.
Soils
A total of 3 soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in Table

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above tributaries of the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
15 January 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m)
wide. This equates to a required minimum of 19 shovel tests along the 1.2 miles (1.9 km) of
ROW. Horizon fell just short of the TSMASS by excavating a total of 17 shovel tests within the
Project Area. The TSMASS were not met due to the fact that the Project Area surface
consisted of eroded uplands with exposed gravel matrices. All excavated matrices were
screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense
clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are
presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
17 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Sievers
A Unit 3H Flowline ROW will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated
as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that
Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project Area relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Cyclops State 57-3-28 Unit 1H Well Pad Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 35

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Cyclops State 57-3-28
Unit 1H well pad and access road right-of-way (ROW) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area;
Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, it is
located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered
to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources
survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to
determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered
eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the
cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit
number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 8.7 miles (14.0 kilometers [km])
southeast of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Threemile Draw, Texas topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a well pad
that measures approximately 400.0 by 400.0 feet (121.9 by 121.9 meters [m]; 3.7 acres) and an
associated access road ROW that measures approximately 1758.0 by 30.0 feet (535.8 by 9.1
m; 1.2 acres). Overall, the Project Area totals 4.9 acres. It is located entirely on GLO land.

Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
9 March 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre for block acreage projects measuring between 3.0 and 10.0
acres in size. This equates to a required minimum of 8 shovel tests across the 3.7 acres
comprising the well pad portion of the Project Area. In addition, the TSMASS require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet in width. This
equates to a minimum of 5 shovel tests along the 1758.0 feet (535.8 m) of associated access
road ROW. In all, a minimum of 13 shovel tests across the entire Project Area were required to
meet the minimum survey standards. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of
13 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited
successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6.
Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
13 excavated shovel tests.

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Fredericksburg State Unit 3-8 1H Well Pad Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 36

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Fredericksburg State
Unit 3-8 1H well pad and access road right-of-way (ROW) in Reeves County, Texas (Project
Area; Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, it
is located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is
considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations
of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton)
has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural
resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey
was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any
existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon
conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 5.8 miles (9.3 kilometers [km])
southeast of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Sand Lake, Texas topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a well pad that
measures approximately 400.0 by 400.0 feet (121.9 by 121.9 meters [m]; 3.7 acres) and an
associated access road ROW that measures approximately 2022.0 by 30.0 feet (616.4 by 9.1
m; 1.4 acres). Overall, the Project Area totals 5.1 acres. It is located entirely on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project
Area (THC 2017). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is the Lara Cemetery (RV-C005).
This small, family cemetery is located approximately 3.0 miles (4.8 km) southeast of the Project
Area.
Soils
Only 1 soil type is mapped within the Project Area. This soil is summarized in Table 1 (NRCS

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landform above a tributary of the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field
efforts that there existed a high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within
the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
9 March 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre for block acreage projects measuring between 3.0 and 10.0
acres in size. This equates to a required minimum of 8 shovel tests across the 3.7 acres
comprising the well pad portion of the Project Area. In addition, the TSMASS require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet in width. This
equates to a minimum of 6 shovel tests along the 2022.0 feet (616.4 m) of associated access
road ROW. In all, a minimum of 14 shovel tests across the entire Project Area were required to
meet the minimum survey standards. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of
14 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited
successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6.
Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
14 excavated shovel tests.

Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Fredericksburg State Unit 3-8 1H well pad and access road ROW will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed
undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on a
terrace adjacent to Salt Creek, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed
a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the
boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A Horizon archeologist assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on 21 March 2017.
This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The
Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16
shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet in width. This equates to a
minimum of 16 shovel tests along the 1.0 mile (1.6 km) of access road ROW on GLO land.
Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 17 shovel tests within the Project Area.
All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh
or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the
excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the observation of a chiseled slab
of caliche engraved with the letter “H” on one face (Figures 7 through 10). No artifacts were
found in association with the slab, and no other engraving suggestive of a headstone/grave
marker were noted on its surface. It is located where the proposed access road ROW enters
GLO land at the northwest corner of Section 6 within Block 57. Based on its location at the
section corner, as well as its overall lack of association with any other cultural materials/features
in a remote and featureless location in the desert, the slab is interpreted as a property/section
corner marker. This assessment was confirmed by Anadarko’s survey crews who routinely
encounter similar property markers on Anadarko projects in the region. As such, it was not
formally recorded as an archeological site. As can be seen in the photographs, Anadarko
survey crews have clearly marked the slab with flagging tape and instructions to not disturb its
location. As such, it will not be impacted by the current undertaking. Aside from the caliche
slab, no cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
17 excavated shovel tests.

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Teton 56-2-39 Frac Pond to the Winghead 6-2-43 Frac Pond Pipeline Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 38

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Teton 56-2-39 Frac
Pond to the Winghead 6-2-43 Frac Pond Pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in Reeves County, Texas
(Project Area; Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded.
However, a portion of the Project Area is located on property owned by the Texas General Land
Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the
undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of
Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services,
Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the
ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within
the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 3.3 miles (5.3 kilometers [km])
southeast of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Orla, Texas, and Orla SE, Texas, topographic quadrangle maps. The Project Area consists of a
pipeline ROW that measures approximately 2.6 miles (4.1 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 meters [m])
wide (approximately 9.5 acres). However, only 747.0 feet (227.7 m; 0.5 acres) of the Project
Area is located on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of 4 previously
recorded archeological sites within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project Area (THC
2017), while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the
NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). The previously recorded archeological sites and
their distances from the Project Area are summarized in Table 1 below, while their locations
relative to the Project Area are presented in Figure 5.

Of the 4 previously recorded archeological sites within the review perimeter, site 41RV92
crosses the current Project Area. This site was documented as a segment of a historic-era road
with associated utility poles. The recorders of the site assessed it as being ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP. Aside from site 41RV92, no other documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the Project
Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys are mapped within
the boundaries of the current Project Area.
Soils
A total of 2 soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in Table
2 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 6.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above Sand Bend Draw and its tributaries, in conjunction with the presence
of several previously recorded prehistoric sites within the review perimeter, it was Horizon’s
opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
27 April 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals only 747.0 feet (227.7 m) in length,
a minimum of 3 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed ROW. Horizon
met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 3 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated
shovel tests are presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 3.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
3 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Teton
56-2-39 Frac Pond to the Winghead 6-2-43 Frac Pond Pipeline ROW across GLO property will
have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the

Revised Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Block 55 (Area C) to Block 2 CTF Gas and SWD Pipeline Projects (Reroute)
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 40

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Block 55 (Area C) to
Block 2 CTF Gas and SWD Pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) in Reeves County, Texas (Project
Area; Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, a
portion of the Project Area is located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office
(GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko,
Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the
Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 6.2 miles (10.0 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Anderson Ranch, Texas topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a pipeline
ROW that measures approximately 4.1 miles (6.6 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 meters [m]) wide
(approximately 14.9 acres). However, only approximately 1.7 miles (2.7 km; 6.2 acres) of the
Project Area is located on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project
Area (THC 2017). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). While not yet mapped on the Atlas,
site 41RV119 is mapped a short distance to the northwest of the Project Area (Figure 5). This
site was documented by Horizon earlier in 2017 during a survey of Anadarko’s nearby Mako
State 2-34 Frac Pond to Laramie 55-4-7 Frac Pond Water Transfer Pipeline Project. Due to the
presence of only sparse surface deposits, this site was assessed as being ineligible for inclusion
on the NRHP. The horizontal extent of its boundaries do not extend into the current Project
Area.
Soils
A total of 2 soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in Table
1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 6.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above Smith Draw and its tributaries, in conjunction with the presence of site
41RV119 only a short distance to the northwest, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts
that there existed a high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the
boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
27 April and 11 July 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of
subsurface shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS)
require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 1.7 miles (2.7
km) in length, a minimum of 27 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed
ROW. Due to the presence of eroded gravels over most of the Project Area surface, Horizon
fell just short of the TSMASS by excavating a total of 24 shovel tests within the Project Area. All
excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or
were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the
excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
24 excavated shovel tests.

Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Block
55 (Area C) to Block 2 CTF Gas and SWD Pipeline Projects across GLO property will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within
the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of
the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.
Sincerely,
For Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Block 54 (Area C)
Main Corridor Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) in Reeves County, Texas
(Project Area; Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded.
However, a portion of the Project Area is located on property owned by the Texas General Land
Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the
undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of
Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services,
Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the
ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within
the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 6.7 miles (10.9 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Sand Lake, Texas topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a pipeline ROW
that measures approximately 3.1 miles (5.0 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 meters [m]) wide
(approximately 11.3 acres). However, only approximately 1.1 miles (1.8 km; 4.0 acres) of the
Project Area is located on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project
Area (THC 2017). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a historic-era debris scatter.
This site, 41RV96, is located approximately 2.9 miles (4.6 km) northwest of the Project Area.
Soils
A total of 2 soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in Table

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above numerous unnamed drainages, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the

deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
26 April 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 1.1 miles (1.8 km) in
length, a minimum of 18 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed ROW.
Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 18 shovel tests within the Project Area. All
excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or
were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the
excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
18 excavated shovel tests.

Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Block
54 (Area C) Main Corridor Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects across GLO property will have
no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within
the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of
the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Block 55 to Block 54
(Area C) North Connector Corridor Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) in Reeves
County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be
privately funded. However, a portion of the Project Area is located on property owned by the
Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the
state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On
behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental
Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance
with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were
located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to
have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under
Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 7.7 miles (12.4 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Mentone SW, Texas, and Sand Lake, Texas, topographic quadrangle maps. The Project Area
consists of a pipeline ROW that measures approximately 6.7 miles (10.8 km) long by 30.0 feet
(9.1 meters [m]) wide (approximately 24.4 acres). However, only approximately 1.2 miles (1.9
km; 4.2 acres) of the Project Area is located on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project
Area (THC 2017). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a historic-era debris scatter.
This site, 41RV96, is located approximately 3.1 miles (5.0 km) north of the Project Area.
Soils
A total of 2 soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in Table
1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 5.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above several unnamed drainages, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field
efforts that there existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
25 April 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 1.2 miles (1.9 km) in
length, a minimum of 19 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed ROW.
Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 19 shovel tests within the Project Area. All
excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or
were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the
excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
19 excavated shovel tests.

elevated landforms above Halamicek Draw and its tributaries, in conjunction with the presence
of a previously recorded prehistoric site within the review perimeter, it was Horizon’s opinion
prior to the field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
26 April 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 2.6 miles (4.2 km) in
length, a minimum of 42 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed ROW.
Horizon fell just short of the TSMASS by excavating a total of 39 shovel tests within the Project
Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware
mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of
the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table
3.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
39 excavated shovel tests.

Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Block
55 to Block 54 (Area C) South Connector Corridor Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROWs across
GLO property will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or
considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be
allowed to proceed with the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the
ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or
burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas,
all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO
should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.

Block 55 to Block 54 (Area C) South Connector Surface Site Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 45

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Block 55 to Block 54
(Area C) South Connector Surface Site Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures
1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project
Area is located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is
considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations
of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton)
has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural
resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey
was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any
existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon
conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 13.1 miles (21.1 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Mentone SW, Texas topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a small surface
site that measures approximately 200.0 by 125.0 feet (61.0 by 38.1 meters [m]; 0.6 acres). It is
located entirely on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of 1 previously
recorded archeological site within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project Area (THC 2017),
while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP
within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). The previously recorded archeological site and its
distance from the Project Area are summarized in Table 1 below, while its location relative to
the Project Area is presented in Figure 5. No documented cultural resources, including any
listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the Project Area. Based on
the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys are mapped within the boundaries of
the current Project Area.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above Halamicek Draw, in conjunction with a previously recorded prehistoric
site only a short distance to the northwest, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that
there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within
the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
26 April 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 0 and 3.0 acres in size. As
the Project Area totals approximately 0.6 acres, a minimum of 2 shovel tests were necessary
within the Project Area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 3 shovel tests
within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter
[mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are
presented in Table 3.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
3 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Block
55 to Block 54 (Area C) South Connector Surface Site on GLO property will have no adverse
effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as
SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the

eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 8.7 miles (14.0 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Anderson Ranch, Texas, Mentone SW, Texas, and Halamicek Ranch, Texas, topographic
quadrangle maps. The Project Area consists of pipeline ROWs that measures approximately
7.1 miles (11.4 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 meters [m]) wide (approximately 25.8 acres).
However, only approximately 4.0 miles (6.4 km; 14.5 acres) of the Project Area is located on
GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of 1 previously
recorded archeological site within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project Area (THC 2017),
while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP
within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). The previously recorded archeological site and its
distance from the Project Area are summarized in Table 1 below, while its location relative to
the Project Area is presented in Figure 5. No documented cultural resources, including any
listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the Project Area. Based on
the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys are mapped within the boundaries of
the current Project Area.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above Halamicek, McCarty, and Smith draws, and their tributaries, in
conjunction with the presence of a previously recorded prehistoric site within the review
perimeter, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a moderate to high
potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project
Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
3 May 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface shovel
tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 4.0 miles (6.4 km) in
length, a minimum of 64 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed ROW.
Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 72 shovel tests within the Project Area.
All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh
or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the
excavated shovel tests are presented on Figures 7 and 8. Shovel test data are presented in
Table 3.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new
prehistoric lithic scatter within the extreme southern extent of the Project Area. This site,
41RV116, is summarized below.
Site 41RV116
General Description
Site 41RV116 is a newly recorded prehistoric lithic scatter recorded within the extreme southern
portion of the Project Area, approximately 600.0 feet (183.0 m) northeast of previously recorded

site 41RV107 (Figures 9 and 10). It is situated on the southern slope of a small rise just to the
north of Halamicek Draw. The location, just east of an existing lease road, has a gravel-covered
and deflated erosional surface spotted with scattered sagebrush, mesquite, creosote, and
various cacti (Figures 11 and 12). Surface visibility across the site ranged from 75% to 100%.
A total of 9 shovel tests were excavated across this site along the proposed ROW. All 9
produced negative results for subsurface cultural materials.

Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41RV116 consisted of roughly 30 lithic flakes of chert,
fine-grained quartzite, and chalcedony, along with several biface and uniface fragments (Figure
13). No formal tools or fire-cracked rock (FCR) were noted on the site that would reflect the
use of the location as a campsite. Rather, the presence of available gravels on the erosional
surface of the site and an abundance of specimens reflecting the early stages of the lithic
reduction process suggest that the location likely served as source of raw lithic materials.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the surface of site 41RV116, and no evidence of any
subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 9 shovel tests excavated across the
site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed surface materials, the assessed horizontal extent of the
site measures approximately 328.1 feet (100.0 m) north to south by 246.1 feet (75.0 m) east to
west.
All observed cultural materials were noted on the erosional surface of the site. No evidence of
subsurface cultural deposits was noted within any of the 9 shovel tests excavated across the
site.
Summary
Site 41RV116 was documented as a moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter on a small rise to
the north of Halamicek Draw. Chert, fine-grained quartzite, and chalcedony gravels on the
erosional surface of the site provided a source of raw lithic material that was exploited by the
aboriginal occupants of the region. This is evidenced by the variety of early stage lithic flaking
debris scattered over the surface of the site. The absence of any formal tools, FCR, or cultural
features on the site suggested that it did not double as a campsite.
Site 41RV116 is located approximately 600.0 feet (183.0 m) northeast of previously recorded
site 41RV107. Despite their relative proximity, no cultural materials were observed on the
surface between these 2 locations, indicating that they are separate sites rather than 1 larger
site.
Based on: 1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; 2) the lack of buried, stratified
cultural deposits; and 3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic materials on the site, it is
Horizon’s opinion that site 41RV116 is ineligible for formal designation as a SAL. With this in
mind, it is Horizon’s further opinion that no additional investigations are warranted on site
41RV116 in connection with the currently proposed undertaking.

Recommendations
Based on the assessment that site 41RV116 is ineligible for formal designation as a SAL, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline
ROWs across GLO property will have no adverse effect on significant cultural resources
designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends
that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project Area relative to the
jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including
human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction,
use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the
THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated

HJN 160006 AR 46

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Chalk Bluff (Area C) Corridor Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 47

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Chalk Bluff (Area C)
Corridor Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) in Reeves County, Texas (Project
Area; Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However,
portions of the Project Area are located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office
(GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko,
Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the
Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 10.4 miles (16.7 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Narrow Bow Draw, Texas, and Halamicek Ranch, Texas, topographic quadrangle maps. The
Project Area consists of a pipeline ROW that measures approximately 3.2 miles (5.1 km) long
by 30.0 feet (9.1 meters [m]) wide (approximately 11.5 acres). However, only approximately 1.1
miles (1.7 km; 3.9 acres) of the Project Area is located on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project
Area (THC 2017). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric campsite. This
site, 41RV107, is located approximately 1.5 miles (2.5 km) south of the Project Area.
Soils
A total of 2 soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in Table
1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 5.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above John D Draw, McCarty Draw, and their tributaries, it was Horizon’s
opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
26 April 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 1.1 miles (1.7 km) in
length, a minimum of 17 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed ROW.
Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 17 shovel tests within the Project Area. All
excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or
were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the
excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
17 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Chalk
Bluff (Area C) Corridor Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects across GLO property will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within

associated utility poles. When originally recorded, it was assessed as being ineligible for
inclusion on the NRHP. The portion of this site crossed by the current Project Area is located
on private property where no federal nexus exists. As such, it will not be reassessed as part of
the current investigations that focus solely on GLO land. Based on the Atlas database, no
previous cultural resources surveys are mapped within the boundaries of the current Project
Area.
Soils
A total of 2 soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in Table

Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
9 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Emerald
City Corridor Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROWs across GLO property will have no adverse
effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as
SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the
development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely
event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the
proposed undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Block 55 to 54 (Area C) South Corridor Droop Mountain Lateral Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 50

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Block 55 to 54 (Area
C) South Corridor Droop Mountain Lateral rights-of-way (ROWs) in Reeves County, Texas
(Project Area; Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded.
However, it is located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO
is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations
of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton)
has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural
resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey
was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any
existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon
conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 12.9 miles (20.7 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Mentone SW, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a pipeline
ROW that measures approximately 867.0 feet (264.3 meters [m]) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) wide
(approximately 0.6 acres). The entirety of the Project Area is located on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of 1 previously
recorded archeological site within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project Area (THC 2017),
while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP
within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). The previously recorded archeological site and its
distance from the Project Area are summarized in Table 1 below, while its location relative to
the Project Area is presented in Figure 5. No documented cultural resources, including any
listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the Project Area. Based on
the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys are mapped within the boundaries of
the current Project Area.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above Halamicek Draw, in conjunction with the presence of a previously
recorded prehistoric site within the review perimeter, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field
efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
26 April 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals only 867.0 feet (264.3 m) in length,
a minimum of 3 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed ROW. Horizon
met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 3 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated
shovel tests are presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are presented in Table 3.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
3 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Block
55 to 54 (Area C) South Corridor Droop Mountain Lateral across GLO property will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the

Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
18 May 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 0 and 3.0 acres in size. As
the Project Area totals approximately 2.1 acres, a minimum of 6 shovel tests were necessary
within the Project Area. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 6 shovel tests within
the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm])
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The
locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are
presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
6 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Block
55-55 - Block 2 CTF Junction Surface Site on GLO property will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Fort Pillow 54-4-13 1H Flowline ROW
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 52

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Fort Pillow 54-4-13 1H
Flowline right-of-way (ROW) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 to 4). The
development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project Area is located
on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a
political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted
with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of
the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if
any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if
the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources
investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 7.7 miles (12.4 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Mentone SW, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a pipeline
ROW that measures approximately 1.0 mile (1.6 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 meters [m]) wide
(approximately 3.6 acres). It is located entirely on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Internet at the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s)
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area.
Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the
NRHP within the review perimeter. No documented cultural resources, including any listed on
the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the Project Area.
Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have been undertaken
with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a historic-era debris scatter.
This site, 41RV96, is located approximately 2.2 miles (3.5 km) north of the Project Area.
Soils
One soil type is mapped within the Project Area. This soil is summarized in Table 1 (NRCS
1980) and presented Figure 5.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above several unnamed drainages, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field
efforts that there existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
18 May 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the Project Area totals approximately 1.0 mile (1.6 km) in length, a minimum of 16
shovel tests were necessary within the Project Area. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a
total of 16 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through
0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils
prohibited successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on
Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
16 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Block
55-55 - Block 2 CTF Junction Surface Site on GLO property will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above Halamicek Draw and tributaries of McIlvain Draw, in conjunction with
the presence of a previously recorded prehistoric site within the review perimeter, it was
Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for
undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for

Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
18 May 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 360.0 feet (109.7 m)
in length, a minimum of 1 to 2 shovel tests shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the
proposed ROW. Horizon exceed the TSMASS by excavating a total of 3 shovel tests within the
Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm])
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The
locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are
presented in Table 3.
Results

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Mako State 2-34 Frac Pond to Laramie 55-4-7 Frac Pond Water Transfer
Pipeline ROW
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 54

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Mako State 2-34 Frac
Pond to Laramie 55-4-7 Frac Pond Water Transfer Pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in Reeves
County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be
privately funded. However, a portion of the Project Area is located on property owned by the
Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the
state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On
behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental
Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance
with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were
located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to
have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under
Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 6.7 miles (10.8 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Anderson Ranch, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a pipeline
ROW that measures approximately 6.2 miles (10.0 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 meters [m]) wide
(approximately 22.5 acres). However, only approximately 4555.3 feet (1388.5 m; 3.1 acres) of
the Project Area is located on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area.
Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the
NRHP within the review perimeter. No documented cultural resources, including any listed on
the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the Project Area.
Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have been undertaken
with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric campsite. The
centroid of this site, 41RV49, is located approximately 2.0 miles (3.3 km) northeast of the
Project Area.
Soils
A total of 3 soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in Table
1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 5.
Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above Smith Draw, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that there
existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the
boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
17 May 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 4555.3 feet (1388.5

HJN 160006 AR 54
23 May 2017
Page 6

m) in length, a minimum of 14 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed
ROW. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 17 shovel tests within the
Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm])
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The
locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are
presented in Table 2.

Site 41RV119
General Description
Site 41RV119 is a newly recorded prehistoric lithic scatter. It is situated within a relatively flat,
upland desert setting, approximately 1500.00 feet (457.2 m) south of an unnamed tributary of
Smith Draw (Figures 7 and 8). The location is spanned by an existing lease road approximately
0.4 miles (0.6 km) southwest of US Highway (Hwy) 285. The site has a gravel-covered and
deflated erosional surface spotted with scattered sagebrush, mesquite, creosote, and various
cacti (Figures 9 and 10). Surface visibility across the site ranged from 75% to 100%. A total of
7 shovel tests were excavated across this site along the proposed ROW. All 7 produced
negative results for subsurface cultural materials.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41RV119 consisted of roughly 25 chert flakes (primary,
secondary, and tertiary), as well as 1 tested chert cobble (Figures 11 and 12). No formal tools
or fire-cracked rock (FCR) were noted on the site that would reflect the use of the location as a
campsite. Rather, the presence of available gravels on the erosional surface of the site and an
abundance of specimens reflecting the early stages of the lithic reduction process suggest that
the location likely served as source of raw lithic materials.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the surface of site 41RV119, and no evidence of any
subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 7 shovel tests excavated across the
site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed surface materials, the assessed horizontal extent of the
site measures approximately 426.5 feet (130.0 m) northeast to southwest by 164.0 feet (50.0 m)
northwest to southeast.
All observed cultural materials were noted on the erosional surface of the site. No evidence of
subsurface cultural deposits was noted within any of the 7 shovel tests excavated across the
site.

Summary
Site 41RV119 was documented as a moderate-density prehistoric lithic scatter within a
generally featureless desert upland to the south of a tributary of Smith Draw. Gravels on the
erosional surface of the site appear to have provided a source of raw lithic material that was
exploited by the aboriginal occupants of the region. This is evidenced by the variety of early
stage lithic flaking debris scattered over the surface of the site. The absence of any formal
tools, FCR, or cultural features on the site suggested that it did not double as a campsite.
Based on: 1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; 2) the lack of buried, stratified
cultural deposits; and 3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic materials on the site, it is
Horizon’s opinion that site 41RV119 is ineligible for formal designation as a SAL. With this in
mind, it is Horizon’s further opinion that no additional investigations are warranted on site
41RV119 in connection with the currently proposed undertaking.
Recommendations
Based on the assessment that site 41RV119 is ineligible for formal designation as a SAL, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Mako State 2-34 Frac Pond to Laramie 55-4-7
Frac Pond Water Transfer Pipeline ROW across GLO property will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed
undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.
Sincerely,
For Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Block 57-57 to 56
South Connector Junction Surface Site Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures
1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project

was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any
existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites
considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon

Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 9.1 miles (14.5 kilometers [km])
southwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Threemile Draw, Texas topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a small
surface site that measures approximately 0.5 acres in size. It is located entirely on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Internet at the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s)
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area.
Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
17 May 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 0 and 3.0 acres in size. As
the Project Area totals approximately 0.5 acres, a minimum of 2 shovel tests were necessary
within the Project Area. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 6 shovel tests
within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter
[mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are
presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
6 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Block
57-57 to 56 South Connector Junction Surface Site on GLO property will have no adverse effect
on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Kaycee Corridor and Gas, Oil, and SWD Lateral Projects
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 56

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Kaycee Corridor and
Gas, Oil, and SWD Lateral rights-of-way (ROWs) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area;
Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, a
portion of the Project Area is located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office
(GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko,
Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the
Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 11.2 miles (18.0 kilometers [km])
southwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Threemile Draw, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a pipeline
ROW that measures approximately 1974.6 feet (601.9 meters [m]) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 m)
wide (approximately 1.4 acres). However, only approximately 1152.1 feet (351.2 m; 0.8 acre) of
the Project Area is located on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area.
Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the
NRHP within the review perimeter. No documented cultural resources, including any listed on
the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the Project Area.
Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have been undertaken
with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area has no associated site form on
the Atlas database. This site, 41RV59, is located approximately 5.2 miles (8.4 km) southeast of
the Project Area.
Soils
One soil type is mapped within the Project Area. This soil is summarized in Table 1 (NRCS
1980) and presented Figure 5.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the distance of the Project Area from
extant water courses, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a
relatively low potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of
the Project Area.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 3-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
17 May 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 1152.1 feet (351.2
m) in length, a minimum of 4 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed
ROW. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 4 shovel tests within the Project Area.
All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh
or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the
excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
4 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Kaycee
Corridor and Gas, Oil, and SWD Lateral ROWs across GLO property will have no adverse effect
on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any
cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at
any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed
undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should
cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project
Area (THC 2017). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the Project
Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys are mapped within
the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is an extensive prehistoric
campsite. This site, 41RV49, is located approximately 3.7 miles (6.0 km) northeast of the
Project Area.
Soils
A total of 2 soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in Table

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above Narrow Bow Draw, Horsehead Draw, their tributaries, and tributaries
of the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a
moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries
of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 4-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
12 July 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) in
length, a minimum of 24 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed ROW.
Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 31 shovel tests within the Project Area.
All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh
or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the
excavated shovel tests are presented on Figures 6 and 7. Shovel test data are presented in
Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 1 new
prehistoric lithic scatter within the extreme southern extent of the Project Area. This site,
41RV120, is summarized below.
Site 41RV120
General Description
Site 41RV120 is a newly recorded prehistoric lithic scatter recorded within the southern portion
of the Project Area. It is situated on the east-facing gentle slope of a small rise just to the
northwest of Horsehead Draw. The location is part of an active oil field, with a well pad to the
north; several rigs to the west; access roads running to the north, south, and east; and multiple

pre-existing underground pipelines (Figures 8 to 10). Vegetation consists of mesquite,
blackbrush, creosote bush, cenizo, pickleweed, seepweed, sand sagebrush, prickly pear cactus,
Chistmas cactus, tasajillo, yucca, and various short clump grasses. Surface visibility across the
site ranged from 90% to 100%. A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated across this site along
the proposed ROW. All 6 produced negative results for subsurface cultural materials.
Observed Cultural Materials
The cultural materials observed on site 41RV120 consisted of a low-density scatter of a tested
cobble (possibly rhyolite), 1 edge-modified flake tool manufactured from gray chert, and chert
debitage (Figure 11). No formal tools or fire-cracked rock (FCR) were noted on the site that
would reflect the use of the location as a campsite. Rather, the presence of available gravels on
the erosional surface of the site suggests that the location likely served as source of raw lithic
materials.
Cultural Features
No cultural features were observed on the surface of site 41RV120, and no evidence of any
subsurface cultural features was noted within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated across the
site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed surface materials, the assessed horizontal extent of the
site measures approximately 154.2 feet (47.0 m) north to south by 328.0 feet (100.0 m) east to
west.

All observed cultural materials were noted on the erosional surface of the site. No evidence of
subsurface cultural deposits was noted within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated across the
site.
Summary
Site 41RV120 was documented as a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter on the gradual slope of
a small rise to the northwest of Horsehead Draw. Chert and possibly rhyolite gravels on the
erosional surface of the site provided a source of raw lithic material that was exploited by the
aboriginal occupants of the region. This is evidenced by the variety of early stage lithic flaking
debris scattered over the surface of the site. The absence of any formal tools, FCR, or cultural
features on the site suggested that it did not double as a campsite.
Based on: 1) the surficial nature of the observed cultural deposits; 2) the lack of buried, stratified
cultural deposits; and 3) the lack of any temporally diagnostic materials on the site, it is
Horizon’s opinion that site 41RV120 is ineligible for formal designation as a SAL. With this in
mind, it is Horizon’s further opinion that no additional investigations are warranted on site
41RV120 in connection with the currently proposed undertaking.
Recommendations
Based on the assessment that site 41RV120 is ineligible for formal designation as a SAL, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Reeves Oil Pipeline Phase I and Block 56 (Area B)
to Block 55 (Area C) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROWs across GLO property will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within
the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of
the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Block 55 - Chalk Bluff Junction Site Project
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 58

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Block 55 - Chalk Bluff
Junction Site Project in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 to 4). The development
of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, the Project Area is located on property
owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political
subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the
Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
archeological sites were located within the Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the
project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources
investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 12.1 miles (19.5 kilometers [km])
southwest of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Halamicek Ranch, Texas topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a small
surface site that measures approximately 0.3 acre in size. It is located entirely on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Internet at the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s)
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area.
Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the
NRHP within the review perimeter. No documented cultural resources, including any listed on
the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries of the Project Area.
Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have been undertaken
with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric campsite. This
site, 41RV107, is located approximately 1.5 miles (2.4 km) south of the Project Area.
Soils
One soil type is mapped within the Project Area. This soil is summarized in Table 1 (NRCS
1980) and presented Figure 5.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on an
elevated landform above several vegetated drainages linked to Smith Draw, it was Horizon’s
opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a moderate potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 4-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
13 July 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre for projects measuring between 0 and 3.0 acres in size. As
the Project Area totals approximately 0.3 acre, a minimum of 1 shovel tests was necessary
within the Project Area. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating 1 shovel test within the Project
Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware
mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The location of
the excavated shovel test is presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within the 1 excavated
shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Block
55 - Chalk Bluff Junction Site on GLO property will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon therefore
recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project Area
relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in
previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease immediately,
and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Seahawk Corridor

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 4-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
13 July 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 694.9 feet (212.8 m)
in length, a minimum of 2 shovel tests shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the
proposed ROW. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 2 shovel tests within the
Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm])
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The
locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are
presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
20 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Seahawk Corridor Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROWs across GLO property will have no
adverse effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for
designation as SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with
the development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within
the limits of the proposed undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of
the discovery.

Interim Report
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Bell Town Corridor Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 60

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Bell Town Corridor
Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area;
Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However,
portions of the Project Area are located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office
(GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko,
Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the
Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 7.3 miles (11.7 kilometers [km])
southwest of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Derrick Draw, Texas, and Threemile Draw, Texas topographic quadrangle maps. The Project
Area consists of a pipeline ROW that measures approximately 6.8 miles (11.0 km) long by 30.0
feet (9.1 meters [m]) wide (approximately 24.7 acres). However, only approximately 2.5 miles
(3.9 km; 9.1 acres) of the Project Area is located on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project
Area (THC 2017). Similarly, a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the boundaries
of the Project Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys have
been undertaken with the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic procurement
area. This site, 41RV105, is located approximately 5.5 miles (8.9 km) north of the Project Area.
Soils
A total of 3 soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in Table
1 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 5.
Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
prominent landforms above Incline and Threemile draws, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 4-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
12 July 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in

width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 2.5 miles (3.9 km) in
length, a minimum of 39 shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the proposed ROW.
Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 39 shovel tests within the Project Area. All
excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or
were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The locations of the
excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6. Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.

Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
40 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Bell
Town Corridor Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects across GLO property will have no adverse

effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as
SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the
development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely
event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the
proposed undertaking, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the
discovery should cease immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above Salt Creek and one of its tributaries, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to
the field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric
cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 4-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the Project Area for cultural resources on
13 July 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection and the excavation of subsurface
shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in
width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land totals approximately 0.7 miles (1.1 km) in
length, a minimum of 11 shovel tests shovel tests were necessary along this portion of the
proposed ROW. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of 11 shovel tests within the
Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.4-millimeter [mm])
hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited successful screening. The
locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 7. Shovel test data are
presented in Table 3.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the
11 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Mariner
Corridor (Area A) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline ROWs across GLO property will have no adverse
effect on significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as
SALs. Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the
development of the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely
event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently

Anadarko Petroleum Corporation
Block 57 (Area A) Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline Projects
Reeves County, Texas
Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 62

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Block 57 (Area A)
Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area;
Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However,
portions of the Project Area are located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office
(GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko,
Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the
Project Area and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to have any
adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under Texas
Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 3.0 miles (4.9 kilometers [km])
west of Orla, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Red
Bluff, Texas, Orla, Texas, and Threemile Draw, Texas topographic quadrangle maps. The
Project Area consists of a pipeline ROW that measures approximately 27.5 miles (44.4 km) long
by 30.0 feet (9.1 meters [m]) wide (approximately 100.0 acres). However, only approximately
1.1 miles (1.7 km; 4.0 acres) of the Project Area is located on GLO land.

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of 1 previously
recorded archeological site within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project Area (THC 2017),
while a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties listed on the NRHP
within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). The previously recorded archeological site and its
distance from the Project Area are summarized in Table 1 below, while its location relative to
the Project Area is presented in Figure 5.

The Project Area extends across the 1 previously recorded archeological site within the review
perimeter. This site, 41LV15 is a prehistoric lithic procurement area that has an overall
undetermined NRHP eligibility status. The portion of this site crossed by the current Project
Area is located on private property where no federal nexus exists. As such, it will not be
reassessed as part of the current investigations that focus solely on GLO land. Based on the
Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys are mapped within the boundaries of the
current Project Area.
Soils
A total of 2 soil types are mapped within the Project Area. These soils are summarized in Table
2 (NRCS 1980) and presented Figure 6.
Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above Salt Creek, its tributaries, and Sand Bend and Threemile draws, it
was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that there existed a high potential for
undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Fredericksburg 3-8
Unit 1H Flowline right-of-way (ROW) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1 to 4).
The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, a portion of the Project
Area is located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office (GLO). As the GLO is
considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls under the regulations
of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko, Whitenton Group (Whitenton)
has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) to conduct a cultural
resources survey of the portion of the Project Area on GLO land in compliance with the ACT.
The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the
Project Area on GLO land and, if any existed, to determine if the project had the potential to
have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources investigations under
Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 5.8 miles (9.3 kilometers [km])
south of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Sand Lake, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of a pipeline ROW

Archival Research
Archival research conducted via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online database indicated the presence of no previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) perimeter of the Project
Area (THC 2017). Similarly a review of the National Park Service’s (NPS) National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review perimeter (NPS 2017). No documented cultural resources,
including any listed on the NRHP, are located within or immediately adjacent to the Project
Area. Based on the Atlas database, no previous cultural resources surveys are mapped within
the boundaries of the current Project Area.
The closest documented cultural resource to the Project Area is a prehistoric lithic procurement
area. This site, 41RV97, is located approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km) southeast of the Project
Area.
Soils
One soil type is mapped within the Project Area. This soil is summarized in Table 1 (NRCS
1980) and presented Figure 5.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above a tributary of the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the portion of the Project Area on GLO
land for cultural resources on 26 September 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection
and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects
measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land
totals approximately 936.0 feet (285.3 m) in length, a minimum of 3 shovel tests were necessary
along this portion of the proposed ROW. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of
3 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch
(6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited
successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6.
Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the portion of the Project Area on GLO land resulted in entirely
negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area on
GLO land or within any of the 3 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the
Fredericksburg 3-8 Unit 1H Flowline ROW across GLO land will have no adverse effect on
significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs.
Horizon therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of
the Project Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any

Antiquities Code of Texas (GLO) – TAC Permit No. 7883
HJN 160006 AR 72

Mr. Wolfe:
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (Anadarko) is proposing to develop the Cholla State 2-4 2H
Gas, Oil, and SWD Pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs) in Reeves County, Texas (Project Area;
Figures 1 to 4). The development of the Project Area will be privately funded. However, a
portion of the Project Area is located on property owned by the Texas General Land Office
(GLO). As the GLO is considered to be a political subdivision of the state, the undertaking falls
under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). On behalf of Anadarko,
Whitenton Group (Whitenton) has contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
(Horizon) to conduct a cultural resources survey of the portion of the Project Area on GLO land
in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any archeological
sites were located within the Project Area on GLO land and, if any existed, to determine if the
project had the potential to have any adverse impacts on sites considered eligible for formal
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). Horizon conducted the cultural resources
investigations under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) annual permit number 7883.
This interim report summarizes Horizon’s findings and serves as a management tool for
consultation purposes regarding the Project Area. The results of these investigations will
eventually be compiled into a formal report that will incorporate all projects completed under
TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
Project Description
The Project Area is located in Reeves County, approximately 6.0 miles (9.7 kilometers [km])
west of Mentone, Texas. It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Anderson Ranch, Texas, topographic quadrangle map. The Project Area consists of pipeline
ROWs that measure approximately 3540.0 (1079.0 km) long by 30.0 feet (9.1 meters [m]) wide
(approximately 2.4 acres). However, only approximately 1751.2 feet (533.8 m; 1.2 acres) of the
Project Area is located on GLO land.

Archeological Probability Assessment
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial terraces near
stream/river channels or drainages. Additionally, in this part of the state, they are often found in
proximity to playa lakebeds and dune blowouts. Based on the location of the Project Area on
elevated landforms above a tributary of the Pecos River, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the
field efforts that there existed at least a moderate potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in immediate proximity to the
Project Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map suggested a decreased potential for
historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the boundaries of the
Project Area.
Field Survey
Methodology
A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew assessed the portion of the Project Area on GLO
land for cultural resources on 26 September 2017. This entailed intensive surface inspection
and the excavation of subsurface shovel tests. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear projects
measuring up to 100.0 feet (30.5 m) in width. As the portion of the Project Area on GLO land
totals approximately 831.5 feet (253.4 m) in length, a minimum of 3 shovel tests were necessary
along this portion of the proposed ROW. Horizon met the TSMASS by excavating a total of
3 shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch
(6.4-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if dense clay soils prohibited
successful screening. The locations of the excavated shovel tests are presented on Figure 6.
Shovel test data are presented in Table 2.
Results
The cultural resources survey of the portion of the Project Area on GLO land resulted in entirely
negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area on
GLO land or within any of the 3 excavated shovel tests.
Recommendations
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the construction of the Beans
Station 53-4-5 1H Flowline ROW across GLO land will have no adverse effect on significant
cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for designation as SALs. Horizon
therefore recommends that Anadarko be allowed to proceed with the development of the Project
Area relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point

during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance within the limits of the proposed undertaking,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC and GLO should be notified of the discovery.
On behalf of Anadarko and Whitenton, Horizon is seeking documented consultation with your
office in compliance with the ACT.
Should you concur with Horizon’s findings and
recommendations, please sign below and return. Again, this letter serves as an interim report
for consultation purposes. The results of these investigations will eventually be incorporated
into a formal report that includes the results of all cultural resources investigations conducted
under TAC annual permit number 7883 during the 2017 calendar year.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call or email me.
Sincerely,
For Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.
