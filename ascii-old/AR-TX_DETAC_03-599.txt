ABSTRACT
In July 2016, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a cultural
resources survey of a proposed Bell County Water Control and Improvement District
(WCID) waterline easement in Bell County, Texas. The proposed development includes a
15 meter (m) (50 foot (ft)) wide easement roughly 4.5 kilometers (km) (2.8 miles (mi))
long. A segment of the proposed easement is adjacent to the Boone-Hamblin #1 cemetery.
The cultural resources survey of the easement included a visual inspection of bare areas
and shovel testing along the route as well as investigations near the cemetery under Texas
Antiquities Permit #7204. All of the shovel tests were negative and no cultural features
were observed along the route or near the cemetery. However, the visual examination of
the easement did find one lithic scatter (41BL1395). Observed artifacts were chert flakes
and possible cores. No artifacts were collected. There is little chance of encountering
any additional undiscovered cultural resources in the project area. In the event that
human remains and/or archaeological materials are discovered during construction near
the cemetery, then the project activity will stop in the immediate area and DETAC shall
be notified of the discovery. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no
effect” to properties listed or eligible for the NRHP as defined by the National Historic
Preservation Act and SAL as defined by the Antiquities Code of Texas.

INTRODUCTION
In July 2016, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a cultural
resources survey of a proposed Bell County Water Control and Improvement District (WCID)
waterline easement in Bell County, Texas (Figure 1). The cultural resource management survey
was requested by the Texas Historical Commission under the Texas Antiquities Code because the
waterline will be part of a public utility controlled by a subdivision of the State of Texas. Texas
Antiquities Permit #7701 was obtained and all terms of the permit were carried out pursuant the
Texas Antiquities Code. The report was prepared following the short report format outlined by the
Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (2005a).
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural resources within
the project area boundaries and investigate potential impacts to the Boone-Hamlin #1 Cemetery
adjacent to the easement. The proposed easement was visually examined and shovel tests were
excavated in areas with low surface visibility. Site 41BL1395 was recorded as a small lithic scatter
on the shoulder of an upland ridge. Investigations at the cemetery found several large stones but no
features or artifacts consistent with a historic period cemetery. No graves were found in the
easement. No artifacts were curated.
DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or
eligible for the NRHP as defined by the National Historic Preservation Act and SAL as defined by
the Antiquities Code of Texas.
DEFINITION OF THE STUDY AREA
The proposed development includes a 15 meter (m) (50 foot (ft)) wide easement roughly
4.5 kilometers (km) (2.8 miles (mi)) long. Total project area is approximately 6.7 hectares (ha)
(16.8 acres (ac)). The easement was marked with flagging tape. Topographically, the project area
spans the Rock Creek floodplain and crosses an upland ridge to the Lampasas River floodplain.
Vegetation includes areas with cedar trees and sparce understory, areas of pasture, and exposed
bedrock with scattered grass. Soils are mostly Purves series (PVD and PrB) on the ridge summit
with Backett association (BRE) and Real-Rock outcrop (REF) on the shoulders and back slopes.
The Rock Creek floodplain is Frio series (Fs) soil. These soils are mostly dark gray silty clay or
clay with a calcium carbonate rich B-horizon (NRCS 2016).

PREVIOS INVESTIGATIONS AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Bell County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. The closest large-scale investigations were conducted
on the Ft. Hood Military Base in northern Bell County and southern Coryell County. These
investigations include surveys, testing, and data recovery projects across the base. Outside of Ft.
Hood, investigations include a survey by the TAS for the 2002 field school (Kibler and Schoeder
2004) and multiple pipelines, powerlines, and road improvements throughout the area (e.g.,
Anthony and Brown 1992; Barnes et al. 2014). In addition to the fieldwork referenced above,
several documents have added significantly to available information on the archaeological record in
this region. Collins (2004) provides a holistic and recent study of the archaeology of the region.
The occupation of the area includes the Paleo-Indian (pre-7000 B.C.), Archaic foraging
cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 - 1600) and the Historic
period (Collins 2004). The Paleo-Indian period (pre-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small mobile
bands of hunters and gatherers that consumed a variety of plants and animals (Collins 2004).
The Archaic (7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented an increasingly
regional and specialized approaches toward exploiting their environment (Fields 2004). The
Late Prehistoric period is divided into the earlier Austin phase and the later Toyah phase as the
adaptation of the bow and arrow along with the spread of ceramics define the period (Prikryl
1993). The Historic period (1600-present) describes both the history behind the current cultural
setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations’ domination of the area to
the European and American immigrants’ establishment of farms, towns and counties. Early
settlers first entered the area in the 1830’s along the Little River. Indian raids were common
until the peace treaties in the mid-1840’s. Bell County was established in 1850 but the modern
boundaries were not established until 1860 when the boundaries with Falls and Milam counties
were recognized. Early settlers attempted to farm, but poor water conditions made farming
unreliable. By the Civil War, many farmers turned to ranching. Farming and poultry production
became popular with modern farming techniques by the 1930’s and the population grew
proportionally with the establishment of Fort Hood during WWII (Connor and Odintz 2016).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code
following survey standards described by the Texas Historic Commission (2016) and report
guidelines set forth by the CTA (2005b). All fieldwork and reporting comply with the ethics
standards of the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register of Professional Archaeologists. No
State Antiquities Landmarks will be affected by the proposed construction.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using the
Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2016).

The atlas contains an updated database with

published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys, location maps, and cultural
resources records. In addition, these records show State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and
NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites. Other records searched include the soils surveys
from 1918 and 1977, Bell County Marriage Records, Tax Records, and Land Titles.
DETAC conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project area. To locate sites, the
pedestrian survey relied on shovel testing and visual examination.

Shovel testing included

excavating an area approximately 30 cm in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch) levels down to the clay
substrate or 80 cm (32 inches). The excavated matrix was screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25
inch) wire mesh screen. Shovel tests were excavated in areas which were not covered in water
from recent rain. The depth of each shovel test was recorded and notes about the soil type and
color were made.

Visual examination of the exposed subsurface was a continuous effort

between shovel tests. Surface inspection photographs and shovel test locations were recorded with
Ashtech GPS units with sub-meter post-processing accuracy. Notes were made about soil color,
texture, and shovel test depth.

RESULTS
The literature searches and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (2016)
revealed three surveys within 1.6 km (1 mi) of the project area and multiple sites along the
Lampasas River (Appendix B). The first archaeological work in the area was conducted for
Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir in the 1960’s (Sorrow et al. 1967) and improvements (e.g. Baxter
1978). Hicks and Company conducted a pedestrian survey for the Ding Dong to Trimmier
transmission line which crosses the northern end of the proposed easement (Anthony and Brown
1992). Five of the sites (41BL975, 41BL976, 41BL977, 41BL978, 41BL980, and 41BL982)
recorded along the transmission line were within one mile of the current project area. All of the
sites except 41BL982 were recorded as lithic scatters, some with burned rock (no definitive midden
ore hearths) along Rock Creek. Site 41BL982 was recorded as Turnbow Mountain which was a
lithic resource location and prominent hill west of the current project area. Hicks and Company
(Karbula et al. 2006) also surveyed a powerline for the Brazos Electric Power Corporation east of
the project area.

The survey passed through two previously recorded sites (41BL1293 and

41BL1232) near the Lampasas River.

Live Oak Cemetery Road was the subject of an

archaeological survey for the Kempner WSC (Voellinger 2013). The survey did not record any
cultural resources within one mile of the current project area.
In addition to these cultural resource management surveys, advocational archaeologists
recorded the Live Oak Cemetery as 41BL1047. The cemetery has burials from the founders of
Youngsport in the early 1800’s (Parkhill 2003). The remains of the earliest graves were moved to
the location as the Lampasas River was to be flooded for 1968 for Stillhouse Lake. The cemetery
is still in use today.

Map and Records Search
Examination of the Texas Historic Sites Atlas also shows the Boone-Hamlin #1 cemetery as
illustrated on the 1979 topographic map. This cemetery was recorded based on the topographic
map but not verified by the THC. The topographic map is based on a 1956 aerial photograph that
was field checked in 1958. The Live Oak Cemetery (41BL1047) is shown to the west and
several other “Cemeteries” at the Andrew Jackson Turnbo Cemetery (Turnbo-Moore) and
Lankford Cemetery locations are also illustrated on the topographic map. The Andrew Jackson
Turnbo Cemetery (Turnbo-Moore) is confirmed to have burials from the late 19th century.

Soils survey maps for Bell County from 1918 and 1978 were examined for the BooneHamlin #1 cemetery or nearby structures. The Carter, Lewis, and Hawker (1918) soil survey
map shows Live Oak Cemetery but no cemetery or structures near the project area. The Soil
Conservation Service (1978) soils map utilized aerial images from the 1950’s for the soils maps.
The image in the soils survey shows the ridge summit is pasture with few trees to the south and
north of the cemetery location (Figure 2). These tree lines correspond with rock walls observed
in the field investigations. The pasture roads that outline the east and west sides of the cemetery
are visible as faint lines. No outlines or other features are visible to delineate the cemetery
location. The soils maps do clearly show Live Oak and Andrew Jackson Cemeteries.
Google earth (2016) photos from 1995 to 2016 were examined (Figure 2). The 1995
photo shows the cemetery is defined by two unimproved roads on the east and west sides.
Scattered trees are visible, but no patterns are visible. Through 2005 the number of trees
increase across the entire pasture and between one and three mobile homes/trailers are placed
south-southeast of the cemetery area. In 2008 the entire pasture area was cleared of trees the east
and west pasture roads are still present, but they have shifted slightly. Between 2008 and 2013
the area changes little. The 2015 photo shows an increased number of unimproved roads and
two areas in the cemetery area which are highly disturbed by vehicle traffic but not excavated
when compared to the nearby stock pond area to the southwest.
Records search focused on the names Boone and Hamblen. William K. Hamblen was
born on 20 October 1817 in Lee County Virginia and moved to Texas in 1834. He moved to
Bell County in 1837 and lived in Saledo. The family had a cemetery plot near Davilla, Texas in
Milam County (Hill and Martin 1969:56) where he was buried. The cemetery was demolished in
the early 1930’s and the graves moved at that time. The Boone family enters Bell County
records in the 1860’s.

Cemetery Investigations
Cemetery investigations were conducted over two days beginning with a visit by the
Principal Investigator to identify surface features followed by work on the proposed easement on
the second day. The PI walked over the reported cemetery area following north-south transects
spaced 3 m (10 ft) apart looking for headstones, footstones, stone tombs, family plot boundaries,
fence lines, walls, gates, unusual or out of place vegetation, uniform depressions, large disturbed

or leveled areas across the reported cemetery area, the pipeline easement, and within a 30 m (100
ft) buffer in all directions. Any of the listed features, individual rocks 10 cm (4 in) in diameter
or larger, or clusters of rocks were recorded with a GPS capable of 1 m (3 ft) post-processed
accuracy.
This initial examination found the cemetery area was in shin to waist high grass. The
easement will follow an unimproved road near the eastern edge of the cemetery. Several isolated
large rocks and collections of rock were observed across the study area.

The highest

concentration of rock was found in the cemetery area, but none of the features listed above were
found. Examination of the easement and the adjacent 30 m (100 ft) buffer found significantly
fewer rocks (Figure 3). Two rock walls and fence lines were recorded south and north of the
cemetery location in tree lines. Based on the abundance of surface rock, the cemetery is/was
most likely in the reported area.

A licensed surveyor for the landower (Whitis Land

Investments) visited the area on the end of the first day. The surveyor confirmed a line of T-post
delineated the property boundary. The cemetery is on the adjacent landower’s property and the
proposed easement will parallel the property boundary.
The second day of investigations were limited to the Whitis Land Investments property.
Investigations focused on determining if graves from the cemetery were present in the easement.
A road grader was provided by the Whitis Land Investments to strip the easement the length of
the cemetery with an additional 30 m (100 ft) on the north and 15 m (50 ft) south side of the
cemetery area to look for evidence of graves. The PI followed the road grader for each cutting
pass to look for buried headstones, foot stones, coffin hardware, grave cyst, or patterned soil
discolorations. The upper 30 cm (12 in) of the soil was a typical A-horizon with dark grayish
brown silty clay over a light brown clay loam with increasing calcium carbonate concentrations
and mottling with depth typical of the Bk-horizon described in the soil series description (Figure
3). Only one large stone was found roughly 40 cmbs (16 inbs). The stone was removed by hand
and the surface trowled smooth. Observed soils were consistent with the remainder of the
striped area at that depth. Stripping continued to approximately 0.6 m (24 in) below the ground
surface where the clay became increasingly dense. No artifacts, other stones, or, patterned soil
discolorations were observed. If graves from the cemetery are still present, then none were
found along the proposed pipeline easement.

A conversation with Tom Heard (Texas Archeological Steward) suggested the cemetery
may have been moved as part of the Stillhouse Hollow Lake project in the 1950-60’s. Despite
the location on the summit of an upland ridge, small cemeteries were often moved to larger
cemeteries for convenience as described for William Hamblen in the Maps and Records Search
section above. The absence of cemetery features would suggest the graves were moved. Recent
evidence of disturbance by the adjacent landowner is not explained, but examination of the areas
did not find items consistent with a cemetery.

Pipeline Survey
The pipeline pedestrian survey included shovel testing and visual examination of the
proposed pipeline easement. Overall, the pipeline will cross a wide upland ridge separating the
Lampasas River to the south and Rock Creek to the north. The ridge summit is mostly pasture
grasses with silty clay soil with few gravels while the ridge shoulders and back slopes are mostly
silty clay soil with common gravels and exposed bedrock. Drainage floors were dark grayish
brown silty clay soils. Shovel tests were excavated where pasture grasses dominated the area
and ground surface visibility was less than 50%. The visual examination was used on the ridge
shoulders and back slopes where cedar trees and scattered grass grew on deflated soils and
exposed bedrock.
A total of 33 shovel tests were excavated along the easement (Figure 6 and Appendix
A). Tests found dark gray silty clay roughly 20 cm (8 in) deep over a Bk on the ridge summit.
Shovel tests along the Rock Creek floodplain contained light gray silty clay roughly 40 cm (16
in) deep over a Bk. No cultural features or artifacts were found in the shovel testing effort.
The visual examination focused on exposed bedrock along the southern half of the
easement and the slopes overlooking Rock Creek at the north end of the easement. The visual
examination was successful in finding site 41BL1395. The site consisted of a scatter of gray
chert flakes and a possible core on the shoulder of an upland ridge near the southeast end of the
easement (Appendix C). Large limestone boulders and smaller cobbles and pebbles covered the
ground surface. Vegetation on the site was limited to short grass and prickly pear along an
unimproved trail through a stand of cedar trees. Observed artifacts included gray chert flakes
and a possible core of the same material in a 20 m (66 ft) diameter area. No evidence of a
burned rock midden or other cultural features were noted.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Bell County WCID will construct a waterline to connect existing waterlines across
an upland ridge separating Rock Creek and the Lampasas River. The proposed easement will be
15 m (50 ft) wide and roughly 4.5 km (2.8 mi) long. Texas Antiquities Permit #7701 was
obtained by DETAC for the cultural resources survey. The Boone-Hamlin #1 Cemetery is
illustrated on the topographic map adjacent to the proposed waterline easement.
Examination of soils maps created in the late 1910’s and the 1950’s along with modern
aerial images from 1995 to 2015 do not confirm the location of the cemetery despite other
cemeteries shown on the same images. Archaeological investigations at the cemetery included a
visual examination of the cemetery area using 3m (10 ft) spaced transects and scraping the
proposed easement to find potential burials. Several rocks ranging from 10 to 70 cm (4 to 28 in)
in diameter were observed in the cemetery area, but no other artifacts or features consistent with
historic period cemeteries was observed. The easement nearest the cemetery was stripped to
look for buried grave features or burial cysts; none were found.

Archival records and a

discussion with a THC Steward revealed old cemeteries were often moved to larger cemeteries
for convenience.
The remainder of the proposed easement was investigated with surface inspection and 33
shovel tests. The visual examination was successful in recording 41BL1395 as a small lithic
scatter on the shoulder of an upland ridge overlooking a drainage and the Lampasas River
floodplain. No evidence of a burned rock midden or other cultural features were observed. No
artifacts were collected or curated. No artifacts were found in the shovel testing effort.
Based on the investigations at the cemetery and along the proposed easement, there is
little chance of encountering any additional undiscovered cultural resources in the project area;
however, in the event that human remains and/or archaeological materials are discovered during
construction, then the project activity will stop in the immediate area and DETAC shall be
notified of the discovery. DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to
properties listed or eligible for the NRHP as defined by the National Historic Preservation Act
and SAL as defined by the Antiquities Code of Texas.
