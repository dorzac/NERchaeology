Archeological Survey of FM 1097 from IH 45 to Anderson Lane, Montgomery County, Texas

Management Summary
On February 5, 2018, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) carried out an intensive survey, as
described in 13 TAC 26.20 and defined in 13 TAC 26.5. Joel B. Butler acted as the principal
investigator, James J. Hill as field director, and Joshua Zatopek as field technician while Heath
Bentley assisted in preparation of this report. Sixteen person-hours were expended during fieldwork
and 20 shovel tests were excavated in support of the survey.
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Houston District proposes to widen and make
improvements to FM 1097 from Interstate Highway 45 to Anderson Lane west of the City of Willis in
Montgomery County, Texas. This project is assigned CSJ no. 1259-01-042 and the archeological
survey was carried out under Antiquities Permit 8249. The total project length is 3.2 kilometers
(two miles), with a total Area of Potential Effects (APE) of
37.4 acres, 17.4 acres of which consist of proposed new right-of-way (ROW).
The project is subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(Section 106) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) because it will involve land to be controlled
by a political subdivision of the State of Texas, with funding from the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and because the undertaking will require permitting from the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE).
A survey of the APE by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. in 2005 identified areas with high probability for
archeological sites but did not have access to all selected parcels at that time. Of eleven remaining
parcels containing proposed ROW targeted for survey, AmaTerra archeologists visited six during field
investigations on February 5, 2018; the remaining five parcels were not available for access at the
time of survey.
No further archeological work is needed and construction is recommended to proceed for the
project area, excluding proposed right-of-way within the remaining five parcels. Those remaining
five parcels will require intensive archeological survey prior to construction.
All land surveyed was located on private property. No artifacts were collected during investigations.
All notes and forms generated during fieldwork will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin.

Project Description
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an archeological survey of proposed
improvements along 3.2- kilometers (two miles) of Farm to Market Road (FM) 1097 in Montgomery
County, Texas west of the City of Willis. The project area extends west from Interstate Highway (IH)
45 to Anderson Lane (Figures 1–5). Under management of the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) Houston District, proposed new right-of-way (ROW) for widening and improvements to the
existing roadway is planned. This project is being constructed under TxDOT CSJ no. 1259-01-042
and field survey was carried out under Antiquities Permit 8249. Detailed schematics and typical
sections are presented in Appendix A. The project area is depicted on USGS Shepard Hill and Willis,
Texas 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles, as seen in Figure 1.
The project is subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section
106) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) because it will involve land to be controlled by a
political subdivision of the State of Texas, with funding from the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA). As described in the Programmatic Agreement between FHWA, TxDOT, and the State
Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, FHWA
projects in Texas are administered by TxDOT. Therefore, the field survey and this report adhere to
TxDOT guidelines and requirements.
Currently, FM 1097 consists of two 12-foot travel lanes, six-foot shoulders, and open ditches. The
proposed widening would add two additional 12-foot lanes throughout the project with six to tenfoot shoulders west of Canyon Falls Boulevard and five-foot sidewalks east of Canyon Falls Boulevard
to IH 45. The existing ROW averages 80 feet throughout the project area and encompasses 20 acres.
Proposed new ROW will be purchased throughout the project length, adding an average of 70 feet
to the total ROW, covering 17.4 acres.
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archeological resources is defined as the footprint of the
proposed project, including within all project-specific locations to the maximum depth of proposed
impacts. Thus, the APE for archeological resources will cover a total area of
37.4 acres to a depth of up to eight feet.
The purpose of the archeological survey was to identify whether any archeological sites would be
affected by the proposed roadway improvements. Fieldwork was carried out on February 5, 2018.
Joel B. Butler acted as principal investigator, James J. Hill as field director, Joshua Zatopek as field
technician. Heath Bentley assisted in writing this report. Sixteen person-hours were expended
during fieldwork and 20 shovel tests were excavated in support of investigations. No difficulties
were encountered during the survey. Weather was mild and overcast with dry soil conditions. No
archeological sites or artifacts were observed in the APE during investigations.
No artifacts were encountered during field investigations. All notes and records generated during
fieldwork will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin.

Chapter 2
Environmental Setting and Background
Physical Setting
The project area is located west of the City of Willis, in Montgomery County. The IH 45 corridor north of
Houston is a rapidly growing suburban area, experiencing considerable residential and commercial
development over the last few decades. This rapid development has led to a dramatic population
increase, and thus, a need for improved transportation infrastructure.
The APE lies within the South-Central Plains Level III Ecoregion (EPA 2013). Locally known as the
Piney Woods, this ecoregion is dominated by low rolling hills punctuated by incised drainages and
vegetated predominantly by pine forests of long leaf and loblolly interspersed with hardwood
species such as pin and white oak, black walnut, mockernut hickory, and birch. Subjected to
extensive logging during the early 20th century, few stands of virgin timber exist.
Common fauna in this region include swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus), plains pocket gopher
(Geomys bursarius), nutria (Myocaster coypus), Scissor-tailed Flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus),
Killdeer (Charadrius vociferous), coyote (Canis latrans), hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus leuconotus),
American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), Texas blind snake (Leptotyphlops dulcis), Gulf Coast
toad (bufo valliceps), and diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin [Ellis et al. 1995]).
Vegetation within project area is a mixture of cleared rangeland, developed land and undeveloped
second- growth woodland. Surface visibility throughout the area is generally poor (less than 30
percent).

Geology and Soils
Geologically, the region is underlain by the Willis formation, dating to the Pliocene and Pleistocene
Epochs. The Willis formation is made up primarily of alluvially deposited coarse sands, clays, and
mixed small siliceous gravels (USGS 2007).
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDANRCS, 2018) Web Soil Survey, soils within the APE consist of Woodville and Conroe fine sandy soils
and Bleiblerville and Normagee clayey soils. (Figure 6). Woodville series soils consist of fine sandy
loam to nine inches, underlain by precultural clay. Conroe series soils consist of deep moderately
well-drained fine sands to depths of 25 inches, underlain by sandy clay loam to 31 inches, below
which precultural sandy clays occur. Both Woodville and Conroe soils have moderate potential for
containing prehistoric deposits above the clay horizons. Bleiblerville and Normagee series soils
consist of very deep dense clays with little potential for containing intact archeological deposits. No
Holocene alluvium is located within the APE.
According to the Abbott’s (2001) Potential Archeological Liability Mapping (PALM) for TxDOT’s
Houston District, some soils within the APE have some potential for prehistoric archeological
remains (Figure 6). Map Unit 2 encompasses the eastern half of the APE while Unit 4 covers the
western half. According to Abbott’s model, areas identified as Unit 2 have potential for
archeological remains on the surface or shallowly buried with no trenching recommended and Unit
4 areas are not recommended for survey. The PALM assignments units correspond with the soils
data for the area.

Previous Archeological Work
According to the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas (2018) there are no
previously recorded archeological sites within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE (Figure 7).
There has been one previous archeological survey within one kilometer (0.62 mile). A 2004 survey
of FM 1097 for the current undertaking included one parcel within and one parcel directly
adjacent to the project area; no sites or artifacts were discovered in either parcel. The survey was
carried out by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (PAI) for TxDOT under TAC Permit 3541 and was limited
to the parcels with available access at that time (Griffith 2005). One Registered Texas Historic
Landmark (RTHL) is located 900 meters east of the APE; the Thomas Chapel United Methodist
Church near downtown Willis.

Regional Cultural Chronology
The proposed improvements along FM 1097 fall within the Southeast Texas Archeological region
(Perttula 2004). The Southeast Texas Archeological region covers multiple major environmental
zones and was home to prehistoric hunting and gathering groups from the Paleoindian period to
the Historic periods (Ricklis 2004). A regional chronology of the Paleoindian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric and Historic periods are detailed in the following section.
Pre-Clovis and Paleoindian (ca. 11,500–8000 years Before Present [BP}
Human occupation of North America may have occurred as early as 16,000 years ago with the
arrival of Pre-Clovis peoples (Jennings and Waters 2014). Archeological remains associated with
these people have been recovered from the Debra L. Friedkin Site in Bell County (Waters et al.
2011). The nearby Gault Site also contain components that are of probable Pre-Clovis origin (Collins
nd). Artifacts associated with these contexts include: bifaces, a discoidal core, edge-modified flake
tools, blade fragments, bladelets, a polished piece of hematite, and macrodebitage (Waters et al.
2011).
The Paleoindian Period dates from 11,500 to 8000 BP and is associated with diagnostic projectile
point types that include Clovis, Folsom, San Patrice, Scottsbluff, Plainview, and Angostura in the
Southeast Texas Archeological region (Ricklis 2004). Paleoindian peoples such as those associated
with Clovis technology, have been traditionally associated with the hunting of extinct big game such
as Mammoth and Bison, though evidence suggests a wide range of subsistence strategies that
includes regional small game and plant resources (Bousman et. al. 2004). Though a Paleoindian
site has not been excavated in the Southeast Texas Archeological region, numerous Paleoindian
diagnostic artifacts have been recovered from surface contexts and excavated from archaic
components. These projectile point types have been recovered from the beds of eroded stream
channels and along the shores of McFaddin Beach (Ricklis 2004).
Archaic (ca. 8800 BP–1500 BP)
The Archaic period in Texas is defined by “pre- or non-horticultural adaptations and pre-ceramic and
pre- bow-and-arrow hunting technologies” (Ricklis 2004: 184). The Archaic Period assemblage
generally includes various types of chipped stone dart points and other lithic tools. In Texas, this
period is divided into three sub- periods: The Early, Middle and Late Archaic Periods. Story (1990)
points out that there is a distinct sequence of dart point types in Southeast Texas, which includes
early side-notched and early stemmed forms and corner notched Keithville, Neches River, and
17

Archeological Survey of FM 1097 from IH 45 to Anderson Lane, Montgomery County, Texas

Trinity type points. This is followed by a transition to the Bell/ Calf Creek, Tortugas and Wells points
later in the Early Archaic (Ricklis 2004). Dart point types associated with the Middle Archaic period
in Southeast Texas include Yarbrough, Bulverde and Travis with Pedernales points common in the
western portion of the region.
Kent and Gary make up the dominant dart point types associated with the Late Archaic in Texas,
with Ensor and Godley types common in the far western portions of the region (Ricklis 2004). Late
Archaic sites in Southeast Texas include a shift to the utilization of more local lithic source material
that is of poorer quality, which signifies a reduction in group mobility and more spatially restricted
territories (Story 1990). A number of Middle to Late Archaic cemeteries have been investigated in
the region, such as those of the Ernest Witte site (41AU36) in Austin County. These two distinct
cemeteries have been dated to separate time periods, and together contained the remains of 206
individuals. One group, which dates to a later period than the other, contained a wide variety of
grave goods that includes Ensor and Fairland dart points, corner-tanged knives, groundstone
“boatstones,” a gorget, bone pins, and conch shell beads and pendants. Large cemeteries with grave
goods become increasingly common in the Late Archaic, and the fact that the same types of grave
goods are found with both male and female burials suggests a somewhat egalitarian social
organization (Ricklis 2004). The end of the Archaic Period is marked by the introduction of ceramic
wares.
Ceramic Period (Ca. AD 100-700)
Ceramics appear in the archeological record in Southeast Texas around AD 100 in the Galveston
Bay area. Aside the introduction of ceramics, “there are currently no indications of major changes in
lifeways during the Early Ceramic Period” (Ricklis 2004: 189). Dee Ann Story (1990) has suggested
that Ceramic Period cultures are archeologically distinct from neighboring regions. Thus, resulting in
her coining of the term Mossy Grover Tradition/Culture for the Ceramic Period in the area.
Sites associated with the Mossy Grove Culture are found in the upper Texas Gulf coast,
southwestern Louisiana, and the southern portions of the Texas Piney Woods. Utilizing ceramics
composed of a sandy paste, Mossy Grove material culture is characterized by thin, decorated
ceramics with narrow incised lines and punctations. Many of these ceramics are described as,
“sandy paste wares with thin walls, floated surfaces, and rounded or conical-shaped bases” (Ellis
2013:141). Differences in settlement and subsistence patterns, as well as technology has led
Archeologists to divide this tradition into two subperiods: the Coastal Margins and the Inland Coastal
Plain (Ellis 2013). The inland subperiod is characterized by a hunter and gatherer subsistence
strategy with short term occupation sites consisting of plain sandy paste ceramics, Gary and Kent
dart points, sparse lithic scatters, and ground stone.
Late Prehistoric (Ca. AD 700-1500)
The Late Prehistoric Period saw the shift in hunting technology from the atlatl to the bow and
arrow around AD 700 (Ricklis 2004). This technology enabled prehistoric hunters to harvest prey
from greater distances with a lesser need for brushless, wide open spaces required for atlatl
maneuverability. The use of arrows is indicated by “the appearance of small, light straight- and
expanding-stem stone arrow points” (Ricklis 2004:194). Projectile points associated with the Late
Prehistoric Period include Alba, Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn types. This period is often divided
into two subperiods. The first subperiod involves the introduction of the bow and arrow, while the
second subperiod encompasses the Toyah Phase, a time of extensive bison exploitation.

Historic Period (Ca. AD 1500-1968)
The APE is located west of the City of Willis, Montgomery County, Texas. FM 1097 is situated
between IH 45 in the city and Lake Conroe, which impounds the west fork of the San Jacinto River.
Historically, the area’s main economies have been logging, rail transportation, oil production, and
county government.
In the eighteenth century, the first Europeans found the region dominated by various tribes of the
Atakapan Indians, a mobile hunting and gathering culture whose range extended south and
eastward to the Gulf Coast. However, most of the native peoples were impacted by European
diseases, war, and immigration, and the area was virtually empty by 1850 (Long 2016). The
following Anglo occupation of the area consisted of settlers from Austin’s Colony, who settled in
the town of Montgomery, about 15 miles west of Conroe. From the 1820s through the 1880s, the
focal point of the county centered in Montgomery, which prospered during the height of cotton
production before the Civil War, but suffered greatly as a result of the Civil War and Reconstruction
(Long 2016).
The City of Willis is located on the Missouri Pacific Railroad eight miles north of the City of Conroe.
Galveston Merchants Peter J. and Richard S. Willis donated property for the establishment of the
townsite during the survey for the Houston and Greater Northern Railroad in 1870. At this point,
a community of African American farmers were settled in the vicinity and had established the first
church in Willis. By 1872, the completion of the rail line through Willis led to an influx of businesses
and residents into the town. Citizens of Willis unsuccessfully petitioned to have the Montgomery
County seat established in the town in 1874. By the late 1870s Willis developed into an important
shipping point for the regions timber and agricultural produce, as well as a manufacturing town for
agricultural equipment, wagons and lumber. The population of Willis rose to 600 individuals by
1884 and the town had acquired schools, churches, several steam-powered saw mills, a brickyard,
two cotton gins, a saloon and gambling house, multiple dry-goods stores and groceries as well as a
Grange Hall (Jackson 2010).
The economic center of the county eventually turned to the community of Conroe, which happened
to be centered at a junction of two major railroad lines in the 1880s: the International-Great
Northern Railroad’s Houston-Crockett line and the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway (Jackson
2015). Due to its centrality as a transportation center, Conroe became the county seat in 1889. By
1892, the community had become a shipping hub for lumber, cotton, livestock, and bricks. Five
steam-powered saw and planing mills, several brickyards, a cotton gin, a gristmill, and several
hotels and general stores were operating (Jackson 2015). In the 1890s Willis had three hotels, two
newspapers and had become the center for the leading tobacco growing region in Texas with at
least seven cigar factories (Jackson 2010). The early twentieth century saw a sharp decline in the
tobacco industry due to the lifting of the Cuban tobacco tariff and a great expansion of the lumber
industry (Jackson 2010, 2015). Timber harvesting decline due to deforestation in the 1930s, just
when the Great Depression hit the area. However, Conroe and the surrounding towns such as Willis
were saved from the fate of many similar communities with the discovery of the Conroe oilfield in
1931 (Jackson 2010, 2015).
Unlike the timber industry, the discovery of oil led to a true boom in the area, increasing the
20

Archeological Survey of FM 1097 from IH 45 to Anderson Lane, Montgomery County, Texas

population from hundreds to thousands in Conroe (Jackson 2010, 2015). Additional stimulus was
created by the construction of U.S. Highway 75 and a revival of the lumber and agricultural
industries during World War II (Jackson 2010). The population of Willis increased to 900 by 1933
and remained stable until the construction of Interstate Highway 45 connected the city to a wider
economic region in the 1960s. Further growth in Willis was stimulated by the construction of Lake
Conroe five miles west of the town on the West Fork of the San Jacinto River (Jackson 2010).

Historic Land Use
The project area is located partly within the City of Willis, a rapidly developing suburb on the
northern edge of the Houston metropolitan area. Inspection of historic maps and aerial imagery
dating to the 1950s (the earliest maps identified depicting structure locations) indicate that the
project location was nearly all rural and forested with some areas being used as open rangeland.
However, one dwelling is visible in a 1957 aerial photograph and 1958 topographic map directly
south of the project proposed ROW near the center of the APE (Figures 8 and 9). While the location
is now developed as a manicured commercial lawn, potential existed for historic-age archeological
deposits at that location. One residence is visible inside the proposed ROW near the eastern
terminus of the project (seen in Figure 6), but this location has been heavily landscaped and
developed into a commercial parking lot and no longer has potential to contain intact archeological
deposits.

Archeological Site Potential
From examining the PALM and soils data, areas containing fine sandy upland soil within the APE
were determined to have high potential for containing intact prehistoric archeological deposits.
Historic map and aerial photographs assessed for this project indicated potential for deposits
associated with a home site located within the APE. Portions of the APE outside these potential
historic sites and upland sandy areas are considered to have low potential for intact archeological
deposits.
Based on previous surveys, local soils, historic maps and imagery, and the Houston PALM, it was
determined that archeological sites encountered within the project area would, in the case of
prehistoric sites, be potentially intact and stratified to depths of up to one meter (3.2 feet) or, in
the case of historic-age sites, at or near the surface.

Field Methods
Survey Area Selection
The selection process for areas to be surveyed for archeological resources was carried out by first
eliminating all areas of proposed ROW surveyed by PAI. The remaining parcels were overlaid on
current aerial imagery to evaluate the amount of earth-disturbing impacts (full development,
intensive landscaping, utilities trenching, etc.) at those locations. Areas with little or no visible
disturbance within PALM unit 2 that had not been previously surveyed, as well as the potential
historic-age site described above, were selected as requiring survey for archeological resources. As
a result of this selection process, approximately five acres (1,150 linear meters) of proposed new
ROW from 11 parcels were selected for the current survey (Figures 10 and 11). Examination of
aerial photography indicated that all existing ROW had been heavily impacted by paving, open-cut
ditches and utilities trenches and did not require archeological survey.
On February 5, 2018, AmaTerra carried out an intensive survey, as described in 13 TAC 26.20 and
defined in 13 TAC 26.5. Six of the 11 proposed survey parcels were available for access at the time
of survey and were grouped into four separate survey areas (see Figures 10 and 11). The remaining
five parcels will be visited as right-of-entry becomes available. The results of the anticipated future
survey will be included to this report as an addendum. Apart from one publicly-owned portion of
proposed new ROW east of Hilltop Drive, all surveyed parcels were located on private property.
Artifacts, if encountered during field investigations, were to be documented and left where
discovered (not collected). Portions of the APE selected for survey were inspected and shovel
testing was conducted in accordance with the THC’s Archeological Survey Standards for Texas
guidelines for linear surveys (16 tests per mile within a 100-foot wide survey area). At that rate, it
was anticipated that investigators would excavate eight shovel tests within the APE with additional
tests excavated when delineating site boundaries, near known sites, within the Archeological
District, or wherever there appeared to be heightened potential for archeological resources. Fewer
tests would be excavated where the APE had obviously been disturbed or subsoil was exposed.
Shovel tests were excavated to 80 centimeters below the surface (cmbs) or to culturally sterile
soils/bedrock, whichever was encountered first. Soil from all shovel tests was screened through ¼inch hardware cloth. The results of each shovel test were recorded on standardized forms
documenting soil conditions, visible horizons, disturbances, or cultural materials present.
Because no soil with potential to contain deeply buried archeological deposits was encountered
within the APE, backhoe trenching was not utilized during field investigations.

Survey Results
AmaTerra archeologists carried out an intensive survey on February 5, 2018. Field conditions
were mild and no difficulties affected the survey. The project area was observed to be of mixed
development, containing residential, commercial, and undeveloped land within the available
survey parcels. Previous disturbances were largely limited to the existing ROW and parcels that
were excluded during the potential selection process, and included modern construction, utilities
trenches, landscaping, and drainage improvements. However, there is evidence of extensive earthmoving disturbances within the surveyed areas, as seen by the presence of mottled clays,
imported gravels, and visibly-leveled surfaces. All of these disturbances would heavily impact
and/or destroy any archeological resources present. During field investigations, no new
archeological sites were discovered. A total of 20 shovel tests were excavated, which are
presented in Appendix B. No artifacts were collected during this survey.
To assist with organization for reporting, this report presents survey results within four areas as
depicted in Figures 10 and 11.

Area 1
Area 1 (Figure 12) is located 60 meters (200 feet) west of Thompson Road across from Hulon
Drive. Approximately half of the APE within Area 1 was heavily landscaped or paved for a
commercial parking lot (Figure 13). Three shovel tests were excavated within the western portion
of this area, all of which encountered heavily mottled clay soil, most likely the result of bulldozing
and grading at the location.

Area 2
Area 2 (Figure 14) is located 500 meters (1,600 feet) east of Thompson Road on the south side of
FM 1097. This area is currently used as the front entry way for Smith Memorial Park, a small
cemetery set back outside the project APE. The area is currently a manicured lawn, though no visible
earthworks or landscaping was apparent (Figure 15). One shovel test was excavated in the center
of the proposed APE in this area, which encountered mottled clays at the surface, which is
interpreted as being pre-cultural in nature.

Area 3
Area 3 (Figure 16) is located directly east of Hilltop Drive on the south side of FM 1097 and extends
500 meters (1,600 feet) east. This area contains portions of three separate private parcels,
approximately 1.2 acres of publicly-owned property, and is largely undeveloped although two
houses dating to the 1980s have been removed along the edge of the proposed ROW. Trees
have been cleared throughout the area and it has been partially re-vegetated over the past ten
years (Figure 17). Nine survey shovel tests were excavated throughout the area, encountering loose
sandy soil to depths of up to 80 centimeters. One shovel test (JZ2) encountered modern glass,
whiteware, and a plastic cap from the surface to 20 centimeters below the surface (cmbs). Six
subsequent shovel tests in the vicinity encountered other modern debris and fill gravels, while
surface inspection found the remains of an apparent RV camping area (Figure 18). Because there
is no evidence of structures at the location in historic imagery or topographic maps, all posts and

electric hardware observed date to the 1980s or 1990s at earliest, and because observed glass
and ceramics are not identifiable as being greater than 50 years old, this location was determined
to not be an archeological site.

Area 4
Area 4 (Figure 19) is located 100 meters (320 feet) west of the southbound IH 45 service road on
the south side of FM 1097. This area is currently undeveloped, though it is well- maintained and is
regularly manicured (Figure 20). One shovel test was excavated within the proposed APE in this area,
encountering mottled clays and imported gravels at the surface, indicating disturbance and
probable filling associated with landscape modifications.

Summary and Recommendations
On February 5, 2018, AmaTerra carried out an intensive survey, as described in 13 TAC
26.20 and defined in 13 TAC 26.5. The project was conducted under the ACT and Section
106 of the NHPA and all work conformed to the guidelines for implementation of these
regulations under 13 TAC Chapter 26 as well as 36 CFR 800. No prehistoric or historic-age
artifacts or archeological sites were discovered during field investigations.
Construction is recommended to proceed for the surveyed portions of the project area with no
further archeological work being necessary. However, the remaining five unsurveyed high
probability parcels within the new right-of-way, where access was unavailable at the time of
survey (identified in Figures 10 and 11 in Chapter 3 and Table 1 below)), are recommended
for intensive archeological survey prior to construction.
All land surveyed was located on private property. No artifacts were collected during
investigations. All notes and forms generated during fieldwork will be curated at TARL in
Austin.
