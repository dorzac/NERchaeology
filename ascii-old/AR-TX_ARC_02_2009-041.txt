ABSTRACT
The City of Dallas is planning the Elm Fork Flood Protection Project near
the intersection of Mañana and Spangler Roads and in the Daniels Creek
Area along the Elm Fork floodplain. AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC)
reviewed the project areas and made recommendations to survey only the
two new wetland cells that will be constructed in the Daniel’s Creek Area.
Based on those recommendations, which are based on the geotechnical
coring and test pitting data in conjunction with the otherwise shallow
impact to the surface of the floodplain (3-5 feet), the Fort Worth District
of the Corps of Engineers agreed that five backhoe trenches needed to be
excavated in the proposed wetland cells. In reviewing the previous
investigations that have been conducted in the floodplain of the Elm Fork,
ARC determined that deeply buried prehistoric archaeological sites could
be recovered in the floodplain. Historic sites were unlikely, unless in the
form of a trash dump. No archaeological sites were recorded during this
survey, which could be due to the shallow nature of the project. Therefore,
ARC concludes that further cultural resource studies are unnecessary and
recommends that the construction of the proposed project should be
allowed to proceed.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Dallas is planning the Elm Fork Flood Protection Project near the intersection
of Mañana and Spangler Roads and in the Daniels Creek Area along the Elm Fork
floodplain. AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) reviewed the project areas and made
recommendations to survey only the two new wetland cells that will be constructed in the
Daniel’s Creek Area (Appendix A). Based on those recommendations, which are based
on the geotechnical coring and test pitting data in conjunction with the otherwise shallow
impact to the surface of the floodplain (3-5 feet for the depth of the new wetland cells and
pond), the Fort Worth District of the Corps of Engineers agreed that five backhoe
trenches needed to be excavated in the proposed wetland cells. All the other areas were
previously disturbed or would not experience subsurface impacts and no further
recommendations were necessary. The two new wetland cells are located in the Daniel’s
Creek Area of the Elm Fork floodplain on the west side of Dallas, Texas (Figure 1). The
City contracted with Freese and Nichols, Inc. to conduct the environmental permitting
and Freese and Nichols Inc. contracted with ARC to conduct the intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of the proposed locations. The survey area is located
approximately 230 meters (m) east of Wildwood Dr and 270 m west of Bickham Rd. The
northern boundary is approximately 525 m south of California Crossing Rd and
approximately 1.5 kilometers (km) north of the intersection of Loop 12 and SH 114. The
Elm Fork of the Trinity River is approximately 300 m south of the survey area.
The survey was necessary because the City of Dallas is a political subdivision of the State
of Texas. The Antiquities Code of Texas is applicable for this investigation, and since
waters of the United States will be impacted, the Texas Historical Commission will not
only act as the State Review Agency but also will act as the Section 106 review agency
for the US Army Corps of Engineers. Texas Antiquities Permit Number 5361 was issued
for the archaeological survey. The purpose of this survey was to locate cultural resources
and make recommendations about their significance and how they might be impacted by
construction. Relevant federal legislation includes the Section 404 Permit under the Clean
Water Act, the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and
Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No.
11593 “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,” and Procedures for
the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36CFR800), Appendix C.
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (n.d.). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural environment and cultural history of the study area. This is followed by the
research design and the methodology used to carry out the study. The results of the
investigation follow and constitute the body of the report. The last chapter presents
recommendations that arise from the study. A list of references cited concludes the
report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The survey area lies in the Blackland Prairie plant community of North Central Texas,
which is bordered on the west by the Eastern Cross Timbers (Diamond, Riskind, Orzell
1987: Figure 1). More specifically, the survey area is in the floodplain area of the Elm
Fork Valley. The Upper Cretaceous Eagle Ford shale flanks and underlies the Elm Fork
floodplain and is bordered to the east and south by Quaternary terraces. The surface of
the survey area is mapped as Quaternary alluvium, which is Holocene in age (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1988). Sand and gravel have been mined from the surrounding area
between Loop 12 and Tom Braniff Drive. Geological studies within the Elm Fork basin
indicate that floodplain deposits dating back to 18,000 BC are present (Prikryl 1990:17).
The Elm Fork floodplain is generally flat and frequently inundated when heavy rains
occur upstream. The survey area is mapped as Trinity clay that is frequently flooded
(Coffee, Hill, and Ressel 1980: Map 23). The Trinity clay is a deep, nearly level,
somewhat poorly drained, floodplain soil. It is moderately alkaline to depths greater than
1.2 meters. Permeability is very slow, runoff is slow, and the shrink swell potential is
very high. Arents soils adjacent to the north and south of the study area coincide with
areas that have been mined for gravel and sand. Most pits have been backfilled with
overburden and exhibit discontinuous or reverse stratigraphy.
The surface layer of the Trinity clay is a very dark gray (10YR3/1) clay that is seven
inches thick and has a clear smooth boundary. Below this is a layer that extends to twenty
inches and is a dark grayish brown (10YR4/1) clay with a moderate fine to medium
blocky structure. This layer grades through a diffuse smooth boundary into the next layer,
which is twenty-five inches thick, and is very dark gray to black in color. Below fortyfive inches, the clay is a dark grayish brown (2.5Y4/2) or a very dark grayish brown
(2.5Y3/2) color. This extends to a depth of at least sixty-eight inches, is extremely hard,
and has a coarse blocky structure. Dry soil cracks extend to depths of as much as thirty
inches.
Knappable gravels are noted to occur on the surface of the surrounding uplands (Peter
and McGregor 1988:281, Figure 13-2). In terms of usable stone, the Uvalde Gravels were
the major source for lithic raw material. A well-known gravel field occurs at Northlake,
which is located approximately five miles upstream from the study area (Prikryl 1990:9).
These gravels consist of about 90 percent quartzite and 10 percent chert (Menzer and
Slaughter 1971:217-218). Hays, Hellier and Kennerly (1972:18) mentioned that natural
cobble deposits occur in the uplands immediately west of the Elm Fork. The buried
gravels underlying the study area are considered to have been inaccessible to the
prehistoric inhabitants.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Culture History
Prehistoric occupation within North Central Texas dates before 8500 BP, and is identified
in the archaeological record by distinctive spear points such as Clovis, Dalton and
Plainview. These types of artifacts have been recovered from deeply buried floodplain
deposits along the various forks of the Trinity River in North Central Texas (Crook and
Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Daniel Prikryl reported that in the Lower Elm Fork area most
of the Paleoindian sites are located on the terraces above the floodplain (1990:19).
The Early Archaic period 8500-6000 BP coincides with the onset of a drying period in
North Central Texas that marks the termination of the Pleistocene period, and isolated
Early Archaic components have been reported in the area. The Middle Archaic period
6000-3500 BP saw stabilization in the environment that is reflected in current climate
conditions of the oak-savannah and grasslands that are present as the Eastern Cross
Timbers. Middle Archaic sites are typically located on terraces adjacent to the Elm Fork
of the Trinity River rather than on tributary terraces (Prikryl 1990:73).
The population in North Central Texas as shown by site numbers saw a significant
increase during the Late Archaic 3500-1250 BP. A wetter environment contributed to
expansion of the Eastern Cross Timbers woodlands, and sites from this period are
typically found on perennial tributaries with a small density along the Elm Fork. During
the Late Archaic, there was a significant increase in the use of quartzite for the
manufacture of Gary, Ellis, Elam and Dallas projectile points, which indicates an increase
in the use of natural resources (Prikryl 1990:76).
Sedentary life ways increased during the Late Prehistoric I period from 1250-750 BP.
The appearance of ceramics, the bow and arrow and houses in the archaeological record
coincided with a drier climate shift. Site density decreases overall and along tributaries
during this period. The percentage of quartzite tools decreases from the Late Archaic, and
diagnostics from this period include expanded stem arrow points such as Scallorn and
Alba (Prikryl 1990:79-83). By the Late Prehistoric II 750-250 BP, there is an increase in
buffalo bones in site deposits and a shift in the tool kit with the appearance of Harrell,
Fresno and Washita arrow points, along with scrapers and flake drills. Sites from this
period are typically located on sandy terraces above the flood plains of major tributaries
(Prikryl 1990:80).
Very little archaeological evidence of historic Native American occupation has been
found in North-Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas and is
possibly due to the Native Americans migrating out of the area because they were unable
to adapt to the changing climate (Skinner 1988:103). Yet archival documents and historic
accounts in North Central Texas demonstrate that Native Americans were still present in
the area into the late 19th century.

Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, the aboriginal inhabitants
continued to play a role in the history of the region. Garrett (1972:24) states “Indian
hostilities almost depopulated North Texas (of Anglo dwellers) after 1839. It dwindled to
less than half.” Hostilities continued until the Treaty of 1843 was signed by the State of
Texas and ten Native American tribes. This treaty provided the impetus for settlement of
several North Central Texas counties.
Dallas County began to see the first Anglo settlers make their way to the prairie lands
during the 1840’s. Anglo settler John Neely Bryan first occupied Dallas County in 1841
on the bluff of the Three Forks to the Trinity River. This early settlement attracted other
settlers who arrived to receive land grants or to join established colonies within the area.
Many settlers came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although only 160
families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57). Many of the
families that obtained land through these grants maintained and farmed their land well
into the mid-twentieth century.
The Civil War took its toll on the North Central Texas population, as most of the ablebodied men left to fight for the Confederacy. Still, Dallas County continued to grow and
prosper after the war. The primary industries throughout Dallas County were agricultural
until the twentieth century. This industry was replaced by manufacturing soon after the
Great Depression. Defense factories built near Grand Prairie for the development of
goods for World War II attracted those seeking work from rural areas. From the 1940s
onward, Dallas and Tarrant Counties’ many factories continued to turn out a wide variety
of products, including airplanes, helicopters, mobile homes, electronics, and plastics.
Along with the increase of manufacturing was a rapid rise in the population of Dallas,
Fort Worth, and the surrounding communities. Between 1950 and 1990, Dallas County
has tripled in population to almost two million residents (Handbook of Texas Online
2009).
Previous Investigations
Surveys discussed in this portion of the report are plotted on Figure 2. Previously
discussed sites and surveys are not repeated here. All non-referenced data are from the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2009).
Sites on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River have been recorded in surveys as early as the
1930s. R.K. Harris, a member of the Dallas Archaeological Society (DAS), recorded the
first sites in the area in 1936 (Harris 1936). Harris and DAS members did considerable
work surveying the Elm Fork south from Denton. Prikryl gives a thorough review of the
DAS’s fieldwork through the 1960s (Prikryl 1990:21-20). In recent decades, the DAS
attempted to relocate many of these sites, but found many of them no longer exist, due in
large part to development.
A number of studies were conducted on the Elm Fork throughout the 1970s and 1980s,
mostly concerned with buried sites in the floodplain. In 1971, a University of Texas at
Arlington survey was conducted along the Elm Fork north into Denton County, and

evaluated and recorded 35 prehistoric sites within the floodplain (Hays et al. 1972). A
survey was conducted in 1978 at McInnish Park that located two shell lens sites,
indicative of occupation and faunal resource procurement sites (Skinner 1978). The
Upper Trinity Watershed was the subject of numerous studies throughout the 1980s and
1990s, contributing to broad understanding of prehistoric occupation Lower Elm Fork
Basin (Yates and Ferring 1986; Ferring 1990; Prikryl 1990; Skinner, Whorton and Young
1991; Anthony and Brown 1994). These studies also recorded numerous sites along the
Elm Fork. Additionally, Texas Water Development Board sponsored several studies in
the 1970s, throughout the Elm Fork floodplain, but no sites were recorded.

Figure 2.

Previous investigations in the vicinity of the study area.

Recent studies have continued to locate prehistoric sites. Approximately two miles
upstream from the study area, ARC conducted a study of the Hackberry Creek
archaeological site (41DL383), which sits within the floodplain on the west side of the
Elm Fork (Skinner and Ferring 1999). The 1999 survey was conducted because of dam
construction on Hackberry Creek that located the Late Archaic site. Four 1-meter square
test units were excavated and ten backhoe trenches were dug to depths of up to 3.5
meters. These resulted in the recovery of numerous artifact assemblages containing lithic
and faunal cultural resources, as well as human remains. Lithics recovered include
various projectile points knapped from both chert and quartzite, large cores and bifaces
likewise made from both chert and quartzite, and other stone tools like metates and
hammer stones. Faunal remains recovered various types of animal bone, some burned or
processed into tools, and approximately 150 mussel shells, though none showed signs of

heat-treating. Some human remains were also recovered. These included several
fragments of human long bone and one dental crown. They were ascertained to be at least
200 years old due to weathering and decay. The survey defined and recorded the
boundaries of the site, and did not recommend any further investigation or consideration
of the site for the National Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological
Landmark.
In 2001, ARC conducted an additional survey for the University of Dallas in anticipation
of development of a tract of land bisected by Tom Braniff Drive (Kent, Trask and
Skinner 2001). The 133-acre tract was adjacent to the southern border of the study area
on the south side of the Elm Fork. A surface examination was performed, shovel tests
were excavated to depths of 60 to 100 cm in high probability areas outside the survey
area’s marshlands, and four backhoe trenches were placed throughout the project area to
depths up to 3.6 meters. Despite this thorough examination, the survey failed to locate
any cultural resources. The report authors interpreted these results as indicative of the
study area’s low probability for either historic or prehistoric occupation, and
recommended no further study.
Three 2004 studies were conducted within a five mile radius of the study area. Two
surveys were conducted by Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, Inc. (PBQD) in the
summer of 2004 for the Texas Department of Transportation in anticipation of road
widening and improvement projects. The first was performed for improvements to SH
114, and covered a number of miles along the highway. During this survey, a backhoe
trench was excavated near the study area. The trench was excavated to bedrock
approximately 1 meter deep and did not recover any cultural resources (Ahr 2004a). The
study as a whole also failed to locate cultural resources, and no further investigation was
recommended. A second PBQD study was conducted for the widening of Luna Road
(Ahr 2004b). The survey included a pedestrian survey with 15 shovel tests and 6
trenches. A single quartzite flake was located in the upper ten cm of a shovel test
excavated approximately 4500 feet to the northwest of the study area. This flake was the
only cultural resource recovered, which otherwise consisted of all negative shovel tests
and backhoe trenches (Ahr 2004). A third survey was conducted by Geo-Marine in
preparation of construction of the Elm Fork Water Treatment Plant Pre-Sediment Basin
near Weaver Lake (Largent 2004). The survey bored nine locations using an exploratory
drilling device and dug three deep backhoe trenches in locations established as high
probability areas for archaeological material by the earlier boring. No cultural resources
were located during the course of the project, and no further investigation of the area was
recommended (Largent 2004).
ARC conducted a third study near the study area from the fall of 2006 to the winter of
2007. Approximately 2.5 miles to the southeast of the study area, ARC monitored the
construction of two segments of Irving, TX’s Elm Fork Relief Interceptor Pipelines
(Todd, Craver and Skinner 2007). Monitors were present throughout construction and
examined the soil as it was dug by trackhoes. Monitors also took soil samples
intermittently as well. No cultural resources were located by the monitors, either in the
examined soil or in the profiles of the machine excavated trenches.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Previous investigations have shown the Elm Fork floodplain has a high potential for
containing buried prehistoric archaeological resources (Hays 1972; Ferring 1990; Yates
and Ferring 1986, and others). Prehistoric sites have been found buried in the floodplain
and exposed in the present river and creek banks as well as in the floodplain silts away
from the present drainage channels. Furthermore, sites have been found on the tops of
low knolls in the floodplain and in terrace deposits on the valley margin. The Daniel’s
Creek study area presents at least one low knoll located in the floodplain as well as acres
of level floodplain sediments not adjacent to recognizable drainage channels.
Furthermore, a location adjacent to the old Daniel’s Creek channel presents a third setting
that is distinct from the knoll and the level floodplain. Although lateral channel
movement may have destroyed some site deposits, this movement along with siltation
due to flooding, is likely to have also buried prehistoric sites under the present surface.
Historic occupation is not likely to be found in the floodplain unless historic trash was
placed in gullies or on creek banks along unmapped fishing/hunting camp roads that
crossed the floodplain and have been covered by overbank flooding.
Methodology
In order to conduct the archaeological survey, ARC first reviewed the information about
the study area found in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas. In addition, the 1920 soils
map of Dallas County published by the USDA Soil Map and Sam Street’s Map of Dallas
County from 1900 were examined for historic structures mapped in the study area.
Neither map showed any structures near the study area. In order to evaluate the 13.2 acre
wetland cells, the entire area was walked by the authors using transects spaced 15-20 m
apart, and notes were made about the ground exposure, surface artifacts, soil types and
disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed. Photographs were taken along the route using
a Canon PowerShot SD600 2.0 mega pixel digital camera. This was done in order to
insure thorough coverage of the surface. The current growth of grass, young trees,
greenbriar and poison ivy obscured the present ground surface and limited eye height
visibility. Surface visibility ranged from 0 to 50 percent. Major subsurface exploration
was done using a trackhoe. The Corps of Engineers had agreed that five trenches be
excavated to the depth of construction (3-5ft) or a greater depth, if possible, due to the
saturated nature of the surround areas. The authors following Vogel (2002) evaluated
each trench. All trenches and holes were backfilled after mapping and recording was
completed. Trench matrices were described based on texture and color. The Munsell Soil
Color Chart was used to identify the specific soil colors in each test. The trench locations
were determined with a handheld Garmin GPSmap76 receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into two sections with the description of the survey area
followed by the survey results. The conclusions end the chapter.
Survey Area
The survey area is within the level floodplain of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. The
majority of the eastern half of the survey area fell within the boundaries on an old gravel
quarry that had closed and now was overgrown with weeds and other invasive plants
(Figure 3). The remainder of the survey area in the floodplain was overgrown with
greenbriar, poison ivy, hackberries, oaks, bois d’arcs and mesquites. The terrain was level
and several large swampy wetlands existed throughout the survey area (Figure 4). This
saturated terrain limited the areas were trenching was possible, but five locations were
ultimately explored. Ground visibility throughout the survey area was 0-50 percent and
eye height visibility was 1 to 15 meters. An old channel to Daniel’s Creek was located
near the southwest tip of the large eastern cell. This channel, however, was less than 30
cm deep and only a meter wide and not very well developed. Some small quartzite
gravels, (quarter to golf ball size) were noted in the channel.

Survey Results
The entire survey area was walked over by a two person crew spaced 20 m apart in order
to scout for locations where trenching could be done. As previously mentioned the
majority of the survey area was an existing wetland with 6 to 12 inches or more of
standing water. A total of 5 trackhoe trenches were excavated within the boundaries of
the survey areas (Figure 5). The first trench was placed on a small knoll south of the old
Daniel’s Creek channel and was at an angle of 4°, perpendicular to the channel. This
trench was 7 m long and was excavated to a depth of 1.43 meters. The upper 52
centimeters (cm) was a homogeneous clay fill with small peds that was very dark brown
(10YR2/2) and roots ranging from fine to coarse were only found in this layer. This fill
rested on a 43 cm thick layer of very dark gray (10YR3/1) uniformly compact silty clay
that graded at its bottom into a compact moist dark gray (10YR4/1) clay.
Trench 2 was located on level terrain approximately 200 m northwest of the first trench
and in a low flat area away from any creek channels or swamps. This trench was 7 m
long and was excavated to a depth of 1.3 m at an angle of 340°. The top 49 cm was a
homogenous clay fill with small peds that was very dark gray (10YR3/1). This layer
contained abundant roots from nearby vegetation. This fill rested on 44 cm of very dark
grayish brown (10YR3/2) homogenous clay without peds. Small amounts of calcium
carbonate (CaCO 2) , less than 1 millimeter, were noted as this layer graded into the

bottom 37 cm. This layer was a dark gray (10YR4/1) clay with less CaCO 2 than the
middle layer.
Trench 3 was approximately 30 m north of Trench 2 at a 40° angle. This trench was
approximately 3 m long and 1.4 m deep (Figure 6). It was situated on a small knoll that
was surrounded on the north and west by swamp. The upper 70 cm was the same very
dark gray clay as in the first two trenches and graded into a similar middle layer as
Trench 2, but with less CaCO 2. The middle layer was 55 cm thick and graded into a
similar third layer as Trench 2.

areas. No cultural materials were revealed. View is to the south.

Trench 4 was excavated approximately 40 m east of Trench 3 at an angle of 100°. This
trench was 7 m long and 1.5 m deep. This trench was located near a swamp that had a
small drainage channel flowing out of it to the southwest (Figure 7). The upper layer was
consistent the other three trenches and contained very dark gray clay with small peds.
This layer extended to 1.2 m and contained small amounts of CaCO 2 . Roots were only
present in the upper 50 cm. The upper layer rested on a similar dark gray (10YR4/1) clay
with abundant CaCO 2 as the previous three trenches.
Trench 5 was excavated approximately 20 m south of Trench 4 at an angle of 70°. This
trench was located on the south side of the same small drainage flowing out of the swamp
and was 5 m long and 1.6 m deep. The trench was situated approximately 5 m west of a
large fabricated berm that borders the swamp. The fill in this trench was consistent with
mixed backfill, which was loose mottled matrix of clay and subsoil. Small gravels, pea to

quarter size, were mixed throughout and water seepage began to fill up the bottom of the
trench. No artifacts or developed soil horizons were noted in any of the trench walls.
Shovel testing was not conducted in the survey area because the area was very saturated
and trenching exceeded the survey standards adopted by the Texas Historical
Commission (CTA 2002).

Conclusions
It had been predicted that prehistoric archaeological sites could be found in the Elm Fork
floodplain. However, no archaeological sites were uncovered during the trenching in the
survey area for the Daniel’s Creek-Elm Fork Relief. As expected, no historic sites were
uncovered due to the floodplain setting. On the other hand, previous investigations
demonstrated that prehistoric sites could be present in this setting. However, the majority
of these sites previously recorded in the floodplain are deeply buried (3-8 m deep) and
the testing performed during this survey only reached half that depth (1.5m). Although
archaeological sites have been recorded near the study area, these sites were located on
terrace deposits above the Elm Fork floodplain.
Deeper testing conducted by ARC in 2001 on the south side of the Elm Fork adjacent to
this study area also revealed no archaeological sites despite testing to below 3 m. This
was attributed to presence of seasonal flooding, making the floodplain a less than
desirable place to occupy. However, all of the floodplain shell-lens sites upstream along
the Elm Fork are located between 0.1 and 0.2 km of the existing river channel. Thus, it is
reasonable to expect that sites might be found buried under the sediments within the
study area. The project will only require shallow excavation, which would not disturb any
deeply buried sites.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the negative results of the survey of the Elm Fork Flood Protection Project, AR
Consultants, Inc. recommends that construction of the proposed project be allowed to
proceed without further cultural resource investigations. If cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately cease in that area and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission and the Fort Worth District of
the US Army Corps of Engineers should be notified. Work should not continue until
discussions with the proper agency have been concluded.

RE:

Archaeological Planning for the Elm Fork Relief Project-Dallas

In preparing the following document, we reviewed the aerial photographs you provided
that show the extent of the two project areas [one which presents the extent of soil types
mapped by the Soil Conservation Service more than thirty years ago] as well as the
aerials which show the proposed location and extent of specific project components in the
Manaña/Spangler Road area and in the Daniel’s Creek area [Attachments 1-4]. We
viewed the historic aerial photographs you compiled and have included one herein. We
have also consulted the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and compiled a list of
reported archaeological sites. TASA indicates that prehistoric sites are present in the area
and they are typically found buried in floodplain sediments and exposed in the river
banks or banks of tributaries, or are found on the surface of terrace deposits where they
have generally been shown to be in deflated or mixed contexts. We also visited the
project areas and viewed them from the closest roadways. After conducting these
activities and consulting the May 28, 2009 letter from the Texas Historical Commission,
we offer the following recommendations:
1. We do not recommend any cultural resources investigations in conjunction with
recommended construction in the Manaña/Spangler Road area [the Northern
area]. This is based on the following observations: the eastern end of the project
area is mapped by the SCS as Arents soils which are the result of gravel mining at
this location. On-site inspection of the property north of Manaña Drive and
between Spangler and Newkirk Roads demonstrated that all of this area has also
been mined for gravel and subsequently has been used as a disposal site which has
actually elevated the area between the mapped Arents soils and Spangler Road
more than two meters above the original ground surface. Furthermore, the
unnamed drainage marked as the Wesco Channel on Attachment 2 was
channelized and straightened between 1958 and 1972 and the area between the
channelized creek and the area north of Manaña was apparently mined for gravel
and this resulted in the creation of the present wetland [Attachments 5, 6 and 7].
TASA has no recorded sites in this heavily disturbed area, which is mapped as
being the first terrace of the river and not in the Elm Fork Floodplain. If it is in the
floodplain, it is at considerable distance from the river channel and thus an
unlikely location for buried prehistoric site deposits.
2. The Daniel’s Creek area [the Southern Area] has not experienced the same
disturbances as the northern area, but most of it will not be significantly disturbed
by the proposed projects. Surveys south of the property and along the Elm Fork
channel in this project area failed to find any evidence of buried prehistoric site
deposits. The Daniel’s Creek Pond is the site of an existing pond that was part of
