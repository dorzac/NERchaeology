ABSTRACT
Gulf South Research Corporation (GSRC) personnel conducted intensive pedestrian
archaeological surveys for the Border Patrol Facilities and Tactical Infrastructure (BPFTI)
Program Management Office (PMO), within Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) U.S.
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at 68 proposed primary and alternate new tower sites for
the proposed upgrade of its Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) program within the U.S.
Border Patrol’s (USBP) Rio Grande City (RGC), McAllen (MCS), and Weslaco (WSL) Stations’
Areas of Responsibility (AORs). It should be noted that some of the tower locations include
multiple tower footprints that were relocated after the initial surveys were conducted. BPFTI is
conducting the investigations on behalf of the Office of Technology Innovation and Acquisition
(OTIA), which is the subcomponent of CBP charged with ensuring that all of CBP’s technology
efforts are properly focused on the mission and integrated across CBP, as well as strengthening
CBP’s expertise and effectiveness in acquisition and program management of contract-delivered
products and services. OTIA is the CBP proponent office for the RGC, MCS, and WSL
Stations’ AORs RVSS upgrade Project. The area of potential effect (APE) for the archaeological
surveys included all areas of ground disturbance for the construction of the proposed primary and
alternate tower sites including access roads, utility corridors, and the tower footprint itself. The
surveys were conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7564. A total of 28
archaeological sites were recorded during the archaeological surveys conducted at the proposed
primary and alternate tower sites. Another two previously recorded archaeological sites were
relocated and updated. Of these 30 archaeological sites, 18 are recommended for additional
testing in order to determine their eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). Until the recommended testing is completed, it is recommended that these sites have
an undetermined NRHP eligibility and be avoided during construction. Another previously
recorded archaeological site is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP. It is
recommended also that this site be avoided during construction. If the site cannot be avoided it
is recommended that the site undergo data recovery mitigation. The remaining 11 archaeological
sites recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP and no additional archaeological work is
recommended for those sites.
GSRC personnel also assessed the potential visual impacts on properties either listed in the
NRHP or eligible for listing in the NRHP. In all instances where such properties were present
within the visual APE of the proposed primary or alternate tower sites, existing modern view
shed intrusions had already impacted the viewshed of the property and the proposed tower was
not considered an adverse visual element.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
GSRC personnel conducted intensive pedestrian archaeological surveys at 68 proposed primary
and alternate tower sites for the RVSS Upgrade Project. These surveys were conducted during
six field sessions between July 27, 2015, and June 30, 2016. The surveys were conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7564. The surveys were conducted for U.S. Customs and
Border Protection (CBP) under contract to Border Patrol Facilities and Tactical Infrastructure
(BPFTI) Program Management Office (PMO), within Department of Homeland Security’s
(DHS) CBP under Contract Number HSBP1014F00337G. The proposed undertaking is the
upgrade of CBP’s Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) program within the U.S. Border
Patrol’s (USBP) Rio Grande City (RGC), McAllen (MCS), and Weslaco (WSL) Stations’ Areas
of Responsibility (AORs). Pedestrian surveys were conducted at all 68 proposed primary and
alternate tower sites.
A total of 28 archaeological sites were recorded during the archaeological surveys conducted for
the RVSS Upgrade Project. In addition two previously recorded archaeological sites were
revisited and their information updated. Of these 30 archaeological sites, 18 are recommended
for additional testing in order to determine their eligibility for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). Until the recommended testing is completed, it is recommended that
these sites have an undetermined NRHP eligibility and be avoided during construction. Another
previously recorded archaeological site is recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP. It is
recommended also that this site be avoided during construction. If the site cannot be avoided it
is recommended that the site undergo data recovery mitigation. The remaining 11 archaeological
sites recommended not eligible for listing in the NRHP and no additional archaeological work is
recommended for those sites.
GSRC personnel also assessed the potential visual impacts on properties either listed in the
NRHP or eligible for listing in the NRHP. In all instances where such properties were present
within the visual APE of the proposed primary or alternate tower sites, existing modern
viewshed intrusions had already impacted the viewshed of the property and the proposed tower
was not considered an adverse visual element.
Section 1 of this report provides a general introduction of the project and Section 2 provides an
environmental background of the project including the soils, geology, vegetation, fauna, and
paleoenvironment of each proposed collocation or new tower location. Section 3 provides a
cultural overview of the project area, including a brief cultural history of the South Texas and
Coastal Bend regions. Section 4 outlines the survey methods used during the field investigation
of the project and Section 5 outlines the previous investigations and previously recorded cultural
resources in the vicinity of the collocation and new tower sites. Section 6 outlines the results of
the surveys. Section 7 summarizes the findings of the cultural resources surveys and
recommendations for the identified cultural resources. Section 8 provides the references cited in
this report. Appendix A contains a shovel test log for all shovel test excavated during the
archaeological survey. Appendix B contains the NRHP Evaluation Inventory forms for the
architectural/aboveground resources.

with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, to address the
potential effects from the proposed undertaking, the upgrade of its Remote Video Surveillance
System (RVSS) program within the U.S. Border Patrol’s (USBP) Rio Grande City (RGC),
McAllen (MCS), and Weslaco (WSL) Stations’ Areas of Responsibility (AORs) (Figure 1-1).
BPFTI is preparing this Environmental Assessment on behalf of the USBP Headquarters.
USBP is the mobile uniformed law enforcement subcomponent of CBP responsible for patrolling
and securing America’s border between the Ports of Entry. As directed by DHS Analysis of
Alternatives (AoA), CBP is investing in the USBP border security technology plan for the Rio
Grande Valley (RGV) Sector. Accordingly, the new plan incorporates both the quantitative
analysis of science and engineering experts and the real-world operational assessment of USBP
on the ground (DHS 2011). This plan includes the utilization of RVSS to provide long-range,
persistent surveillance, enabling USBP personnel to detect, track, identify, and classify illegal
entries through a series of integrated sensors and tower-based surveillance equipment.
Technology considered in the project includes sensors and other surveillance assets, as well as
communications and Command and Control (C2) systems along the border. This technology
would communicate with the RGC, MCS, and WSL Stations’ C2 facilities and would provide an
overall network system of communications and surveillance along approximately 120 miles of
border. Infrastructure to be considered within USBP’s plan includes roadways to and from
RVSS towers, as well as support utilities. Meeting this purpose would provide more efficient
and effective interdiction while reducing the potential for adverse impacts from illegal crossborder activities on the natural and cultural environments in the RGC, MCS, and WSL Stations’
AORs.
The undertaking would provide long-range persistent surveillance capability and was identified
in the new border security technology plan as the most effective technology-based solution for
the RGC, MCS, and WSL Stations’ AORs. The upgrade of the RVSS program is expected to
allow Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) to spend less time locating illegal entries and focus efforts on
interdiction of those involved in illegal cross-border activities, thereby enhancing rapid response
capability through a dynamic enforcement posture.
The undertaking includes the construction, operation, and maintenance of a sufficient amount of
new RVSS towers for improved border surveillance coverage throughout the RGC, MCS, and
WSL Station’s AORs. CBP is currently analyzing 68 potential new field sensor tower locations
within the various AORs for use within the RVSS upgrade project (Table 1; Figures 1-2 through
1-45). There would be a total of 18 new RVSS towers and associated infrastructure in the RGC
AOR, 12 new RVSS towers and associated infrastructure in the MCS AOR, and 10 new RVSS
towers and associated infrastructure in the WSL AOR. Three relay towers, one per AOR, would
also be constructed. These towers are located on Federal, private, and state lands. The current
selected preferred RVSS towers and relay towers are indicated in Table 1.

Three types of tower structures are included as part of the Proposed Action: self-standing towers
(SSTs), monopole towers, and relocatable towers. Only the relocatable towers would require
guy wires. SSTs are steel, lattice-style structures, with a base of three circular concrete piers,
each approximately 4 to 6 feet in diameter. Other foundation types may be used depending on
the site-specific geotechnical characteristics. Depth of the pilings is dependent on tower height
and geotechnical characteristics at each tower site, but would be expected to be less than 60 feet
below ground surface (bgs). SSTs could be up to 199 feet high including lightning protection.
Monopole towers are metal, single-pole towers with reinforced steel and concrete foundations.
The depth of each tower foundation is dependent on tower height and geotechnical
characteristics at each tower site but is expected to range from 10 to 60 feet bgs. Monopole
towers generally range in height from 60 feet to 140 feet but could be up to 199 feet high.
Relocatable towers are towed in place on a trailer and placed on a level ground. The guy wires
will attach to the relocatable tower trailer outrigger infrastructure to stabilize the tower when
extended. If necessary, the guy wires can attach to concrete barriers or other anchors to increase
the tower stability as required. When fully extended these towers can reach a height of up to 120
feet. Each tower would have the design, power requirements, and site and fence enclosure
footprint described below, unless otherwise noted in the detailed proposed tower site discussions.
Figure 1-44 shows the typical elements and the usual layout of those elements associated with an
RVSS tower, regardless of the type of tower. Construction of SSTs or monopole tower sites
results in ground disturbance confined to a 200-foot x 200-foot area (40,000 square feet). All
staging of construction equipment and materials, as necessary, occurs within this footprint during
construction. Each permanent tower site footprint is expected to be up to a 100-foot x 100-foot
(10,000 square feet) square shape or non- square shape, depending on site-specific conditions for
both tower types, and includes a permanent parking area for vehicles. Each tower footprint is
confined to the dimensions mentioned above. Regardless of each tower site’s configuration, the
total area of temporary construction disturbance for each site does not exceed 30,000 square feet,
and the total area of permanent disturbance does not exceed 10,000 square feet. The 30,000square-foot temporary construction area and 10,000-square-foot tower site footprint are
completely included in the 40,000-square-foot survey area for each tower site.
Access drive construction and access road maintenance and repairs are required to move
construction equipment, materials, and personnel to and from the proposed tower sites during
construction. Access drive construction is required to provide access from established public or
private access roads to the proposed tower sites. Access drives would be constructed to provide
access to RVSS sites from established public or private roads. The access drives would be
constructed to provide a 12-foot-wide driving surface with 2-foot shoulders on each side. The
total width of new access drives would be 16 feet. Access drives would be constructed by
mechanically removing vegetation and grading native soils. Following construction activities,
any temporary impact areas would be revegetated with a mixture nursery plantings or a mixture
of native plant seeds (or both), as described previously.
Road maintenance and repairs include reconstruction, widening, or straightening of the existing
road, and installation of drainage structures, and could require either a 30-foot-wide or a 60-footwide temporary construction disturbance area. Drainage structures may include but are not
limited to ditches, culverts, and low-water crossings.

The access roads would be maintained and repaired to the design standard for FC-3 GradedEarth Road. All access roads would have a driving surface of 12 feet with a 2-foot shoulder on
each side of the road (16 feet total) along with improvements such as ditches, low-water
crossings, turnouts, and necessary erosion protection such as riprap and gabion headwalls.
Cultural resources surveys were conducted for all 68 of the proposed, alternate, tertiary option,
and relay tower location sites, though only 43 would be chosen for construction. A Texas
Antiquities Permit (Number 7564) was obtained for the survey of a portion of the survey area.
Two of the proposed tower sites are located on lands owned by the City of Pharr, a subdivision
of the State of Texas, WSL Pharr POE South Tertiary Option 1 and WSL Pharr POE South
Tertiary Option 2 (see Table 1-1). The surveys of those proposed tower sites are covered under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7564. Mr. John Lindemuth, Dr. Bretton Somers, Ms. Jenni
Bivona, Mr. David Hart, and Mr. Brian Thibodaux conducted the archaeological surveys. Ms.
Erin Edwards and Ms. Alexis Thomas conducted the survey of the aboveground/architectural
historic resources. Ms. Sharon Newman and Ms. Liz Ayarbe-Perez conducted the GIS analysis
and produced the maps for the report. Ms. Maria Vidrine helped with data entry and compiled
and formatted Appendix B, which includes all the photographs.

2.1.1 Geologic Unit Descriptions
2.1.1.1 Terrace deposits (Qt)
Terraces deposits are composed of sand, silt clay, and gravel in various proportions, with gravel
in older, higher terrace deposits. Locally these deposits are indurated with calcium carbonate
(caliche) in terraces along streams. The geologic age of these particular Terrace deposits are
Quaternary. Gravel found along the Rio Grande is subrounded clasts of locally derived
limestone and chert and rounded clasts of basalt, volcanic porphyry, quartzite, milky quartz, and
banded chalcedony derived from the west.
2.1.1.2 Yegua Formation (Ey)
Yegua Formation deposits consist of clay with minor beds of sandstone, some concretionary
limestone beds and lenses of oyster shell that are Eocene-Middle in age. In east Texas and the
Gulf Coast to the Rio Grande the formation overlies the Cook Mountain Formation and is in turn
overlain by the Caddell Formation. Deposits consist mainly of sandstone, clay, and lignite. The
sandstone is mostly quartz with some chert which is fine-grained, laminated, and crossbeded.
2.1.1.3 Jackson Group, undivided (OEj)
The Jackson Group, undivided consists of clay, sandstone, siltstone, and tuff. The age of this
particular is Eocene Oligocene.
2.1.1.4 Alluvium deposits (Qal, Qas, Qac)
Alluvium and low terrace deposits of Holocene age along streams. Deposits consist of sand, silt,
clay, and gravel. General alluvium deposits (Qal) also include areas along the lower course of
the Rio Grande River that are divided into areas that are predominantly mud (Qam), silt and sand
(Qas), and clay (Qac) (Barnes 1976).
2.1.1.5 Goliad Formation (Mg)
Goliad Formation (Mg) includes clay, sandstone, marl, calichè, limestone, and conglomerate of
Miocene age (Barnes 1976).
2.1.1.6 Lissie Formation (Ql)
The Lissie Formation is of Quaternary geologic age. Soils within the formation consist of sand,
silt, clay, and a minor amount of gravel. Iron oxide and iron-manganese nodules commonly
occur within the zone of weathering. The topography of the formation is fairly flat and
featureless with the exception of shallow depressions and the presence of pimple mounds.
2.2

FLORA AND FAUNA

The existing collocation and proposed new tower sites are located within the Gulf Coast Prairies
and Marshes and South Texas Brush Country Ecoregions of Texas (Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department [TWPD] 2011). Vegetation commonly found in the South Texas Brush Country
Ecoregion includes honey mesquite, blackbrush (Acacia rigidula), brasil (Condalia hookeri),
lantana, prickly pear (Opuntia spp.), and sideoats gramma grass (Bouteloua curtipendula).
Wildlife commonly found includes Texas horned lizard, great plains rat snake (Elaphe guttata
emoryi), collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu), coyote, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
black vulture (Coragyps atratus), Harris’s hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus), and red-tailed hawk.

PALEOENVIRONMENT

At the terminal Pleistocene, the South Texas environment is thought to have been like a
parkland, with both grassland and forest elements. Large megafauna, such as Mammoth and
Mastodon, as well as other now-extinct animal species, were present. After the end of the
Pleistocene, the climate is thought to have been one of gradually increasing aridity.
Temperatures during the early Holocene were similar to those today, with water more abundant
and vegetation more open. The uplands were probably more open but with groves of mesquite
and other trees, while along the streams there were concentrations of woody vegetation, as well
as occasional mesquite thickets (Hester 1980). Wood species identification of hearth charcoal,
mesquite was clearly present in riverine zones as early as 6000 years Before Present [B.P.]
(Hester 2004). The mesquite and thorny shrubs began to dominate the south Texas countryside
within the historic period. Animals available to prehistoric Indians in south Texas include bison,
pronghorn, antelope, bear, and prairie chicken. Other animals that are available today that were
not available to prehistoric populations include the armadillo and the Javelina (peccary), the
latter first appearing ca. Anno Domini (A.D.) 1400 (Hester 1980, 2004).

CULTURAL SETTING

3.1

PREHISTORIC OVERVIEW

The proposed primary and alternate tower location sites are distributed across the south Texas
archaeological region. The prehistoric cultural chronology of south Texas archaeological region
is split into six broad periods; Paleoindian, Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Protohistoric (Pertula 2004).
3.1.1 Paleoindian Period
The waning of the Ice Age, or Pleistocene, 11,000 years B.P., showed the first evidence of the
Paleoindians in the south Texas area. Their culture would last until 8000 B.P. These first people
relied upon hunting and gathering subsistence and moved as nomadic bands as the seasons
changed following the availability of edible vegetation and game animals in the region.
Archaeological sites have recovered the remains of multiple animals, including a broad range of
fish, horse, bison, rabbit, turtle, lizard, ducks, rats, and other species that the Paleoindian people
used for subsistence resources. It is believed that the Paleoindian population was sparsely
distributed throughout the region, forming small groups that moved frequently across large areas
(Black 1989; Hester 1989, 2004).
The Paleoindian cultural chronology is dependent on projectile points located on sites as being
the primary classification for dates and occupational periods. Archaeological sites in the region
for this period vary from early Paleoindian terrestrial sites to eroded late Paleoindian artifacts
found on the surface mixed with later Archaic period artifacts. Some of the lithic artifacts
recovered are the Folsom, Clovis, Golondrina, Barber, and Angostura projectile points that range
in complexity from early fluted forms to stemmed points by the end of the cultural period. The
late Paleoindian tools and the distinction of early archaic tools become harder to differentiate as
lifestyles drift toward the beginning of the Archaic period (Black 1989; Hester 1989; 2004).
3.1.2 Early Archaic
Archaeological evidence of the Early Archaic period, 8000 to 4500 years B.P., suggests
considerable increase of human population along with the change to a dryer and warmer
environment as compared to the evidence from the Paleoindian period. Hunting and gathering
continued to be the way of life with the major change of this culture being in the designs of flint
knapping. The new distinctive artifact styles found on archaeological sites include two unifacial
tool varieties of Clear Fork and Guadalupe tools, notched net sinker or bola stones, Gower
stemmed points, Early Corner-Notched, Early Expanding-Stem (Bandy, Martindale, Uvalde, and
related forms), Early Triangular dart points, and large-barbed Bell projectile points. Specialized
cooking apparatuses that use fired stone as heating elements began during this period, reflecting
the sophistication of the culture adapting to the region and subsistence techniques (Black 1989;
Hester 1980). Little or nothing is known about the settlement patterns of the Early Archaic in
south Texas. Hester (2004) has subsequently defined two horizons that make up the early
Archaic, the Early Basal-Notched horizon followed by the early Corner-Notched horizon. From
typological cross-dating of projectile point forms, the temporal span of the Early Corner-Notched
horizon extends from ca. 8000 to 5500 B.P. In south Texas the Early Corner-Notched horizon is
typified by corner-notched dart points with recurved or notched bases. These forms fit within the

Martindale-Uvalde-Baker-Bandy continuum and, to a lesser extent, some specimens of the
Gower type. Also associated with this Early Corner-Notched horizon are Guadalupe tools. The
subsequent Early Basal-Notched horizon extends from ca. 5500 B.P. to 2500 B.P. This horizon
is typified by dart points with deep basal notches, large barbs, and distinctive long stems.
Recognized types of this horizon include the Bell and Andice types and possibly Early
Triangular bifaces, which may first appear in the Early Corner-Notched horizon and extend into
this later horizon. Other recognizable traits of this horizon include large unifacial Clear Fork
tools, as well as smaller forms and multinotched “eccentric” Bell/Andice specimens (Hester
2004).
3.1.3 Middle Archaic
The artifact assemblages of the Middle Archaic period, 4500 to 2400 years B.P., are dominated
by Triangular dart points, known as Tortugas and Abasolo, along with regionally specific types
such as the Carrizo (Black 1989; Hester 2004). These newer designs can equally be used as
knives or as tips on darts, spears, or lances, possibly for hunting bison that migrated into the
region during the early part of the Middle Archaic period. In the northern portion of the south
Texas region, Middle Archaic sites are often identified by the presence of stemmed points that
can be cross-dated with projectile points from central Texas (Pedernales and Lange), the Lower
Pecos (Langtry), and the central coastal plain (Morhiss). Utilitarian lithic tools associated with
this period include smaller unifacial distally beveled tools, as well as some bifacial distally
beveled tools (Hester 2004). There is evidence of repeated reworking and resharpening of these
tools. Hester (2004) suggests that these tools may have been used primarily for woodworking.
Ground stone artifacts such as tubular stone pipes, grinding slabs, and manos are common at
Middle Archaic sites, as well as in later contexts (Black 1989).
The subsistence data available, particularly from the Choke Canyon Reservoir area, suggests that
plant resources were heavily utilized during this period. This is reflected in the increase in
formal hearths, earth ovens, and burned rock accumulations. Data recovered at Choke Canyon
from wood species identification from charcoal suggest the use of beans and nuts of mesquite,
acacia, oak, and hackberry (Hester 2004). Other faunal resources include land snails, freshwater
mussels, deer, and other mammals (Black 1989).
Data on settlement patterns from study areas such as Choke Canyon, Caparrosa, and East
Chacon, suggest that Middle Archaic open camp sites are found predominantly along present or
relict stream channels, with sites in the later part of the Middle Archaic being found on
floodplains, low terraces, and natural levees of present stream courses. Burial practices during
this period involved interment in cemeteries such as Loma Sandia. By the later Middle Archaic
period, climatic evidence suggests that the environment shifted to one of the driest environments
ever experienced in the region.
3.1.4 Late Archaic
Climate during the Late Archaic period, ca. 2400 B.P. to A.D. 600/700, slowly changed to a
moister environment with some of the vegetation from the arid period remaining in the western
reaches of Texas. Artifacts recovered from Late Archaic sites within the south Texas plains
include small, corner- or side-notched dart points including Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Fairland,
Shumla, Montell, and Ellis dart points. Other artifacts noted during this period include Olmos

bifaces, small triangular gouge-like tools with specialized resharpening techniques, which may
have also continued to be used into the Late Prehistoric period (Hester 2004). Small distally
beveled tools, such as Nueces scrapers, are also present in Late Archaic contexts, as well as
limited numbers of corner tang bifaces (Black 1989). Late Archaic sites also have extensive
deposits of fire-cracked rock (FCR), including both hearth and earth ovens, as well as grinding
implements such as manos and metates.
Subsistence data, as well as the presence of extensive deposits of FCR and grinding implements
noted above, suggest a further intensification of the exploitation of mesquite and acacia beans, as
well as other plant resources. Faunal data from the Late Archaic contexts show the exploitation
of small animals, such as rodents, rabbits, turtles, fish, lizards, snakes, and deer. Rabdotus snails
and mussels also continue to be common food sources.
Population density continued to rise during the Late Archaic, and camp sites, similar to the later
part of the Middle Archaic, are found concentrated adjacent to present stream channels or
adjacent sloughs. Cemeteries continue to be used during this period. There is evidence of
regional trade occurring during this period, particularly in central Texas (Black 1989; Hester
1980, 2004).
3.1.5 Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric
During the Late Prehistoric Period (A.D. 800 to A.D. 1600) the Late Archaic small, expanding
stem dart points were replaced with still smaller expanding stem Late Prehistoric arrow points.
The differences in typology are difficult to discern in the early portion of the Late Prehistoric
period. Hester (2004) provides an example where Middle Archaic type “dart points,” such as
Ensor, Matamoros, Catan, and Zavala, often occur in contexts that are otherwise Late Prehistoric,
or in some cases in very late parts of the Late Prehistoric period. A distinctive artifact that does
appear during this period is the arrow shaft straightener or spokeshave. This artifact is usually
made of limestone and is often broken from repeated reheating during the arrow-straightening
process (Hester 2004).
The Late Prehistoric can be divided into two time periods termed the Austin and Toyah horizons.
The Austin horizon dates between roughly A.D. 800 and A.D. 1350, while the Toyah horizon
dates after A.D. 1250/1300 (Black 1989; Hester 2004). The Toyah horizon is the best
documented Later Prehistoric pattern in the South Texas region. Cultural traits noted for Toyah
sites included Perdiz points, small end scrapers, flake knives, beveled knives, bone-tempered
pottery, perforators made on flakes, ceramic figurines, pipes, marine shell and freshwater mussel
shell ornaments, tubular bird bone beads, and spatulate objects made on bison bone fragments
(Hester 2004). Faunal material recovered from Toyah sites includes abundant bison bone,
though white-tailed deer may have been more extensively hunted, along with pronghorn and a
variety of smaller game. Turtles, freshwater mussels, and land snails also continue to be part of
the diet. Sites, like in the latter part of the Middle Archaic, as well as the Late Archaic periods,
are located along present stream channels or nearby sloughs, often buried just under the surface
of natural levees. The later part of the Late Prehistoric period, which includes the Toyah
horizon, also shows evidence of south Texas connections to a north-south Plains trade network
(Hester 2004).

By the early nineteenth century the native peoples of the area were either culturally or
biologically extinct or displaced. As a result, the information on the historic Native American
populations of the area is derived predominantly from historic documents from Spanish
expeditions, missionaries, and the earliest Anglo-European explorers and settlers. The Coastal
Bend subarea was inhabited by several different groups of Native Americans during the Historic
Period, including the Coahuiltecans, Karankawas, Lipan Apaches, and Tonkawas. These groups
were subdivided into numerous smaller bands including the Atakapa, Borado, Cavas, Capoque,
Emet, Kohani, Kopani, Malaquite, Payata, and Sana Tamique, as well as others (Hester 1989;
Newcombe 2002).

HISTORIC OVERVIEW

The historic chronology of the South Texas region can be divided into five temporal periods.
These historic periods are defined by distinct artifact assemblages along with historic archival
and documentary evidence. A brief overview of these periods is presented below. Section 3.3
provides a more detailed historic overview specific for the tower sites that have undergone
aboveground/architectural surveys.

3.2.1 Spanish Exploration Period
The Spanish Exploration period begins with the presence of European explorers, mostly of
Spanish descent in the Coastal Bend region. The first Europeans thought to enter the area were
Alvar Nuñez, better known as Cabeza de Vaca, along with three companions (Sánchez 1992).
The Panfilo de Narváez expedition, of which Cabeza de Vaca was a member, was shipwrecked
on the upper Texas coast, at a location they described as the Isla del Malhado (Sánchez 1992;
Hester 1999). The Isla del Malhado was probably Galveston Island or a nearby island, given the
known ethnohistoric and archaeological record (Hester 1999). There is disagreement among
historians, anthropologists, and archaeologists on the route taken by Cabeza de Vaca’s group
across Texas. The Krieger route, which takes Cabeza de Vaca from the upper and central Texas
coast, through southern Texas, into northeastern Mexico, and perhaps back into west Texas, is
the most probable of all the routes proposed given the archaeological and ethnohistoric record
(Hester 1999). By 1535, Cabeza de Vaca and his three companions crossed southern Texas,
reaching different points along the Rio Grande (Sánchez 1992).
3.2.2 The Spanish Colonial Period
No real attempts to settle the area were made until the late seventeenth century in response to a
French settlement established by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle on the Texas coast in
1685. After an unsuccessful attempt at establishing missions in east Texas during the latter part
of the seventeenth century, the Spanish decided that a three-pronged approach that included
mission, presidio, and civilian settlement would be the best strategy to establish a Spanish
presence in the area. The Corpus Christi Bay remained unexplored until 1747, when Joaquín

Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra led an expedition down the Nueces River to its mouth. After
several failed attempts, the first settlement in the area was founded by Blas María de la Garza
Falcòn in 1766. He established a ranch called Santa Petronila, on Petronila Creek. Despite
many ranchers from the RGV applying for and receiving land grants in the lower Nueces Valley
during the end of the eighteenth century, the area was slow to develop. By 1794, a large ranch
belonging to Juan Barrera, known as Rancho de Santa Gertrudis, was established on the north
side of Corpus Christi Bay. An Indian uprising in 1812 forced many of the colonists to seek
refuge in the RGV. Hostilities with the Comanches and Lipans in the area continued until the
end of Spanish Control of the region (Long 2010; A. Fox 1989).
3.2.3 Mexican Colonial Period
With Mexican independence in 1821, the region became part of Tamaulipas. Remaining land in
the area was deeded to individuals by the Tamaulipan government. After several unsuccessful
attempts to establish settlements in the area, Fort Lipantitlán was established in 1831 where the
road from Matamoros to Goliad crossed the river. Both Irish and German settlers also moved
into the area during the 1820s and 1830s (Long 2010; A. Fox 1989).
3.2.4 Texas Republic and Nineteenth Century American Period
The Texas Republic period began in 1836 after the Texas Revolution. During this time the
region became a no man’s land with both Mexican and Texan merchants engaging in illegal
trading within the Nueces valley. Henry Lawrence Kinney established a trading post and fort on
Corpus Christi Bay in 1839 in what would become Corpus Christi. By 1842, a post office had
opened, and in 1845 the settlement experienced a brief boom, though population declined after
the Mexican War (Long 2010; A. Fox 1989).
The Mexican War began only three months after Texas’ formal annexation to the United States.
The primary issue involved in the conflict was the border between Mexico and the United States.
When Texas gained its independence from Mexico in 1836, it claimed the Rio Grande as its
southern boundary. In contrast, the Mexican government considered the Nueces River as the
border. In March 1846, under orders from the president, General Zachary Taylor moved his
troops from Corpus Christi to Brazos Santiago near the mouth of the Rio Grande River. The
Mexican government considered this movement of troops as an act of invasion and engaged the
troops in battle at Palo Alto and Resca de la Palma on May 8 and 9, 1846. This prompted the
U.S. Congress to pass a declaration of war, and hostilities moved south into Mexico. The war
ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo where the United States gained California, Arizona,
New Mexico and the Rio Grande boundary for Texas, as well as portions of Utah, Nevada, and
Colorado. The United States established a series of military posts along the Rio Grande as a line
of defense against further armed incursions into Texas. These included Camp Ringgold (Fort
Ringgold), Fort Brown, Camp Crawford (Fort McIntosh), and Fort Duncan (Bauer 2011; THC
1993).
During this period, large-scale ranching rapidly became one of the major bases of the economy
(Long 2010; A. Fox 1989). Large ranches such as Toluca Ranch and King Ranch were
established in the region. King Ranch ranks as one of the most outstanding and best known of
all cattle enterprises in the history of the southwestern cattle frontier. In 1852, Richard King
purchased several tracts of land fronting Santa Gertrudis Creek. The first grant obtained was the

Ricón de Santa Gertrudis, consisting of approximately 6,273 ha (15,500 ac) of land at the
junction of the Santa Gertrudis and San Fernando creeks near where they join Laguna Madre.
This parcel included the area of present-day Kingsville. King also purchased Santa Gertrudis de
la Garza consisting of approximately 1,619 ha (4,000 ac) of land. It was on this land that King
would begin his cattle operation. In 1860, King founded R. King and Company, along with
partners James Walworth and Mifflin Kenedy, which joined all the land titles of James
Woolworth, King and his wife Henrietta, as well as Mifflin Kenedy (Coalson 2010; Chessman
2010; THC 1966). The Toluca Ranch was founded in 1880 by Florencio Saenz (1836 to 1927)
on part of the Llano Grande (Big Plain) Grant which was deeded to Juan Jose Hinojosa Balli by
the Spanish Crown in 1790. Saenz, a direct descendant of the Balli family, purchased a total of
6,434 ha (15,898 ac) of land to establish his ranch through multiple purchases (THC 1983).
The sectional controversies that divided the North and South in the 1850s troubled and divided
Texans. The secession convention met in Austin on January 28, 1861, and was dominated by
secessionists. On February 1, 1861, the delegates adopted an ordinance of secession, and on
February 23 the ordinance was approved by the voters. Sam Houston, the Governor of Texas at
that time and a Unionist, refused to recognize the authority of the convention and take an oath of
allegiance to the new government. The convention in response declared the office of governor
vacant and elevated Lieutenant Governor Edward Clark to the position (Wooster 2011). During
the Civil War, King and his partners entered into several contracts with the Confederate
government to supply European buyers with cotton while they, in return, supplied Confederate
forces with beef, horses, imported munitions, medical supplies, clothing, and shoes. King, who
also owned a steamship company, moved operations of the steamship to Matamoros under
Mexican registry, which successfully avoided Union blockades for the most part. At the end of
the war, King fled to Mexico, returning after securing his pardon from President Andrew
Johnson in 1865 (Coalson 2010; Chessman 2010; THC 1966).
3.2.5 Twentieth Century American Period
By 1903, the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway was being built through south Texas
to Brownsville, and Henrietta King opened several tracts of her land for sale. Florencio Saenz
also granted right-of-way over his property for the railroad in 1904. With the introduction of the
railroad, the economic base of the area began to change from ranching to farming and dairying.
The population continued to rapidly grow in the region during the early part of the twentieth
century. Several industries, particularly the oil and gas industry, in the early to middle twentieth
century prompted additional large population growth in the region (Stokes et al. 2009).

METHODOLOGY

4.1

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY METHODOLGY

Prior to the initial fieldwork, an archival record check was performed using the Texas
Archeological Site Atlas maintained by the THC. All previously conducted archaeological
investigations, archaeological sites, National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)-listed
properties, Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), Official Texas Historical Markers
(OTHMs), and Historic Texas Cemeteries (HTCs) recorded within the visual APEs of both the
proposed new and existing collocation towers were identified. This information was used to
identify any resources that may be affected by the proposed new tower and collocation of
equipment on existing towers. In addition, the information also provided insight into the types of
resources that may be encountered during the surveys. Project historians also examined the
Historic American Buildings Survey and Historic American Engineering Record of the National
Park Service (NPS), as well as historic maps and subdivision plats documenting the historic
development of the respective study areas.
Archaeological resource surveys were conducted at each of the proposed new and existing tower
sites with expanded footprints. Shovel testing was conducted at the tower footprints and along
non-disturbed portions of the access road and utility corridors where there was the potential for
buried deposits or where surface visibility was below 30 percent overall. Shovel testing was
conducted in accordance with linear surveys for the access road and utility corridors and three
shovel test pits (STPs) were excavated at tower sites with the potential for buried deposits or low
surface visibility. Shovel tests measured 30 centimeters (cm) by 30 cm and were excavated to
the base Holocene deposits where possible. All material was screened through ¼ in mesh
screens, and any recovered cultural material was analyzed in the field and returned to the STP
prior to backfilling. The majority of the access and utility corridors associated with the proposed
tower location sites are located along existing active unimproved roads. As a result, modern
material was present across the archaeological APEs of the proposed tower location sites.
Material lacking distinctive historic attributes (such as clear glass shards, amber glass shards,
aluminum, etc.) was determined to be modern in the field. As a result, those materials were not
considered to be archaeological resources. All STPs were backfilled upon completion.
Summaries of all the STPs excavated during the surveys are presented in tables organized by
tower location and locations of STPs excavated are presented on maps in Appendix A.
4.2

ABOVEGROUND/ARCHITECTURAL SURVEY METHODOLGY

Aboveground/architectural surveys were conducted in the APE for each of the proposed 144
primary and alternate tower sites to assess if there was the potential for effects on
aboveground/architectural historic resources. GSRC personnel consulted the Texas Historic Sites
Atlas to determine what previously recorded historic resources were located within each APE.
The survey crew conducted field investigations beginning in August 2015 and completed the
surveys in April 2016 and completed the following:

Identified and photographed non-archaeological, historic-age resources (built by 1966)
within the proposed 144 APEs.
Noted major physical attributes and design characteristics of each identified historic
resource.
Noted changes and alterations that may affect any of the aspects of integrity of each
identified resource.
Documented and photographed notable characteristics of neighborhoods and streetscapes
in areas previously listed as a registered historic district.
Evaluated historic age resources for inclusion in the NRHP, to be eligible a historic-age
resource must meet at least one of the four National Register Criteria, and it must retain
sufficient integrity to convey its significance. The resource should not only reflect or be
associated with any of the principal themes, patterns, and/or events discussed in the
historic context, it must also be significant within the framework of the context.

NRHP evaluations considered each historic resource on an individual basis and as a contributing
element within a district that meets the criteria for inclusion in the NRHP. When assessing each
historic-age resource on an individual basis, the NRHP evaluation considered the significance of
any known historic associations with important events, trends, or individuals of the past
(Criterion A or B), design and/or physical attributes (Criterion C), or its research potential
(Criterion D). A historic-age resource that is significant for its historical associations does not
need to retain its integrity to such a high degree as one that is significant for its design or
physical attributes; nonetheless, the resource must still be easily recognizable to the period in
which it achieved significance and be able to convey its significance as an NRHP-eligible
resource.
Concentrations of historic resources may lack distinction on an individual basis, but collectively
may constitute a noteworthy grouping that is separate and distinct from its surroundings. In such
a situation, the collection of resources may be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP as a historic
district. To be eligible, the majority of the resources must have been built within the time frame
in which the district achieved significance (period of significance). The historic character and
overall integrity of the potential district are determined by the degree to which physical changes
to the historic-age resources, as well as the construction of modern infill (outside the period of
significance) and/or the demolition of historic-age resources, affect the potential district’s ability
to evoke a sense of the past. To be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, the district must be
significant within the framework of the context developed for the reconnaissance-level survey,
and it must retain sufficient integrity to convey that significance.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

A records search conducted by remote terminal of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,
maintained by the THC, was conducted prior to the initiation of fieldwork to identify previously
conducted cultural resources investigations, previously recorded archaeological sites, and
previously recorded NRHP-listed or NRHP-eligible aboveground resources, such as buildings,
structures, objects, and districts, as well as resources that may have been recorded as part of the
Texas Historic Sites Inventory or other local survey, such as RTHL, OTHMs, and recorded
HTCs. The NRHP includes buildings, structures, sites, objects, and districts that possess
significance at a local, state, or national level and retain sufficient integrity to convey that
significance. An RTHL is a property judged by the THC to be historically and architecturally
significant. The THC awards RTHL designation to buildings at least 50 years old that are judged
worthy of preservation for their architectural and historical associations. The THC administers
another type of marker program that is solely educational in nature and conveys no legal
designation or restrictions on the property. A resource that falls within this category is listed as
an OTHM. Administered by the THC, HTC designation is an official recognition of family and
community graveyards and encourages preservation of historic cemeteries. The designation
imposes no restrictions on private owners’ use of the land adjacent to the cemetery but provides
for the recordation of the cemetery into the county deed records as a historically dedicated
property worthy of preservation. The records search utilized a radius of 1-mile (Table 5-1;
Figures A-1 to A-43). Historic resources located within the archaeological and visual APEs of
the towers are summarized below.

5.1.1.1 Previously Conducted Archaeological Investigations
Three previously conducted archaeological investigations (Atlas Numbers 565, 1260, and 15289)
were on file within 1 mile of the proposed RGC Inside Mustang Gate Chapeno alternate tower
site (THC 2016). All of the investigations consisted of surveys (THC 2016). A small portion of
the beginning of the associated 30-ft roadway overlaps with one of the investigations (565). No
additional information was available about that survey (see Figure A-1).
5.1.1.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
Fifteen previously recorded archaeological sites (41SR264, 41SR265, 41SR266, 41SR267,
41SR268, 41SR269, 41SR270, 41SR271, 41SR273, 41SR274, 41SR275, 41SR276, 41SR277,
41SR278, and 41SR279) are located within the 1 mile search radius of the proposed RGC Inside
Mustang Gate Chapeno alternate tower site and its associated roadway and utility corridors.
None of the archaeological sites fall within the footprint of the proposed tower or its associated
roadway and utility corridors.

5.1.10 RGC Papa Hill Primary
5.1.10.1 Previously Conducted Archaeological Surveys
Four previously conducted archaeological investigations (8848, 11336, 12069, and 20726) are on
record within the 1-mile search radius of the proposed RGC Papa Hill Primary tower site and
associated access and utility corridors (see Figure A-6). All of the archaeological investigations
consisted of surveys. Two of the surveys (8848 and 20726) overlap with the beginning and a 0.8mile section of the proposed RGC Papa Hill Primary tower site’s associated access and utility
corridor (THC 2016). One survey consisted of a linear survey conducted in 1997 for the Texas
Water Development Board under Texas Antiquities Permit number 1779. That survey overlaps
with the northern terminus of the access and utility corridor for the proposed RGC Papa Hill
Primary tower site. None of the archaeological sites recorded during the 1997 survey overlap
with the footprint of the RGC Papa Hill Primary tower site’s associated access and utility
corridor. The second survey (20726) was a survey conducted in 2012 for CBP for road
maintenance along 4.5 miles of road segments. No archaeological sites were recorded during
those surveys. An additional field investigation of an archaeological site that was inadvertently
discovered near the eastern terminus of the project area was conducted in 2015. The site
(41SR403) was exposed after heavy rains and the realignment of drainages led to significant
erosion in the area. The site overlaps with the access and utility corridor associated with the
RGC Papa Hill Primary tower site.
5.1.10.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
Six previously recorded archaeological sites (41SR295, 41SR308, 41SR391, 41SR392,
41SR393, and 41SR403) are on record within the 1-mile search radius for the proposed RGC
Papa Hill Primary tower site and its associated access and utility corridor (see Figure A-5) (THC
2016). One of those archaeological sites (41SR403) overlaps with a portion of the access and
utility corridor associated with the RGC Papa Hill Primary tower site. The site was recorded as a
result of an inadvertent discovery when it was exposed after heavy rains and the realignment of
drainages led to significant erosion in the area. The site consists of a lithic scatter covering a
10,136-square-meter area. Artifacts recorded at the site consisted of predominantly prehistoric
lithic debitage of chert, as well as limited stone tools such as core tools, biface fragments, and a
single projectile point. Lithic material was predominantly chert but also included a single
tertiary flake of chalcedony. The site is in good condition, but had limited potential for
subsurface deposits. Given the limited information potential for the site, the recorder

recommended the site as not eligible for the NRHP. While the site has been recommended as not
eligible, an NRHP eligibility determination was not on record for the site. As a result, the site is
considered to have an undetermined eligibility pending further consultation with the THC.
5.1.10.3 Previously Recorded Historic Resources
No historic resources are on record within the 1-mile search radius and the 0.5-mile visual APE
of the proposed RGC Papa Hill Primary tower site (see Figure A-5).
5.1.11 RGC Papa Hill Tertiary Option 1
5.1.11.1 Previously Conducted Archaeological Surveys
Six previously conducted archaeological investigations (559, 560, 8848, 11336, 12069, and
20726) are on record within the 1-mile search radius of the proposed RGC Papa Hill Tertiary
Option 1 tower site and associated access and utility corridors (see Figure A-6). All of the
archaeological investigations consisted of surveys. Two of the surveys (8848 and 12069) overlap
with the beginning of the proposed RGC Papa Hill Tertiary Option 1 tower site’s associated
access and utility corridor (THC 2016). One survey consisted of a linear survey conducted in
1997 for the Texas Water Development Board under Texas Antiquities Permit number 1779.
That survey overlaps with the northern terminus of the access and utility corridor for the
proposed RGC Papa Hill Tertiary Option 1 tower site. None of the archaeological sites recorded
during the 1997 survey overlap with the footprint of the RGC Papa Hill Tertiary Option 1 tower
site’s associated access and utility corridor. The second survey (12069) was a survey conducted
in 2004 for the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDot) for various road projects across the
Austin, Laredo, Pharr, and Yoakum Districts. This survey also overlaps with the northern
terminus of the access and utility corridor associated with the RGC Papa Hill Tertiary Option 1
tower site. One of the sites recorded during the survey conducted for the City of Roma Water
and Wastewater project and revisited during the 2004 TxDot project (41SR308) overlaps with
the footprint of the access and utility corridor on its extreme northern terminus.
5.1.11.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
Eleven previously recorded archaeological resources (41SR92, 41SR143, 41SR180, 41SR295,
41SR306, 41SR308, 41SR390, 41SR391, 41SR392, 41SR393, and 41SR403) are within the 1mile search radius for the proposed RGC Papa Hill Tertiary Option 1 tower site and its
associated access and utility corridor (see Figure A-6). Two of the archaeological sites
(41SR308 and 41SR392) overlap with portions of the tower site and its associated access and
utility corridor. Site 41SR308, which was recorded in 2001, consists of an extensive lithic
scatter which included lithic debitage as well as limited stone tools including bifaces and core
tools (see Figure A-6). No features were noted at the site and cultural material extended to an
estimated depth of 30 cmbgs. The NRHP eligibility of the site was reviewed in 2005 and the
portion of the site within the TxDOT right-of-way was determined to be ineligible for the NRHP
by the Texas SHPO. The portion of the site which overlaps with the access and utility corridor
of the RGC Papa Hill Tertiary Option 1 tower site is confined to the TxDOT right-of-way. The
second site (41SR392) consists of an open-air campsite recorded in 2008 as part of the Lower
Rio Grande Valley PF225 Border Fence Project for the DHS. The site consists of a lithic scatter
covering an approximately 27,000 m2 area, which overlaps with the RGC Papa Hill Tertiary
Option 1 tower site and a portion of its associated access and utility corridor (see Figure A-6).
Artifacts recorded at the site were dominated by lithic debitage but also included limited stone

tools such as a projectile point tip and semi-formal flake tool. Also noted at the site was
recent/modern historic material. Cultural deposits at the site extended to at least 1.4 mbgs.
Given the possible deeply stratified deposits, the site was recommended as eligible for listing in
the NRHP. While the site was recommended as eligible for the NRHP, no eligibility
determination was on record for the site with the THC database. As a result, the site is
considered to have an undetermined eligibility pending additional consultation with the THC
(THC 2016).
5.1.11.3 Previously Recorded Historic Resources
No historic resources are on record within the 1-mile search radius and the 0.5-mile visual APE
of the proposed RGC Papa Hill Tertiary Option 1 tower site (see Figure A-6).
5.1.12 RGC Relay Tower
5.1.12.1 Previously Conducted Archaeological Surveys
Four previously conducted archaeological investigations (559, 560, 12198, and 13661) are on
record within the 1-mile search radius of the proposed RGC Relay Tower site and associated
access and utility corridors (see Figure A-7). All of the archaeological investigations consisted
of surveys. Two of the surveys (559 and 13661) overlap with portions of the proposed RGC
Relay Tower site’s associated access and utility corridor (THC 2016). One survey (559)
consisted of survey conducted in 1994, but no additional information was on record for the
survey. The second survey (13661) was a survey conducted in 2006 for TxDot of the proposed
US 83 reliever route from Roma to Rio Grande City in Starr County, Texas. This project was
conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit number 4199. That project identified 14 new
archaeological sites and revisited and updated two previously recorded archaeological sites. One
of the newly recorded archaeological sites (41SR384) extends into the footprint of the access and
utility corridor associated with the RGC Relay Tower site (see Figure A-7).
5.1.12.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
Nine previously recorded archaeological resources (41SR143, 41SR298, 41SR299, 41SR301,
41SR342, 41SR381, 41SR382, 41SR383, and 41SR384) are within the 1.0-mile search radius for
the proposed RGC Relay Tower site and its associated access and utility corridor (see Figure A6). One of the archaeological sites (41SR384) overlaps with a portion the RGC Relay Tower’s
associated access and utility corridor (see Figure A-7). Site 41SR384, which was recorded in
2006, consists of a light to moderate density lithic scatter measuring approximately 290 m east to
west by 90 m north to south. Artifacts recorded at the site included prehistoric lithic debitage,
bifaces, core tools, and a possible pestle from the service. Cultural material was found to a depth
of 20 to 30 cmbgs. At the time it was recorded, the site was in poor condition with only
approximately 10 percent of the site being intact. An NRHP eligibility review was also on
record for the site, which states that the SHPO eligibility determination for the site is ineligible
for the NRHP (THC 2016).
5.1.12.3 Previously Recorded Historic Resources
Two OTHMs (Mission Mier a Visita [3405] and The Mier Expedition [5380]) are on record
within the 1-mile search radius of the proposed RGC Relay Tower site and its associated access
and utility corridor (see Figure A-7). Both OTHMs are outside of the 0.5-mile visual APE of the
proposed RGC Relay Tower site.

10724, 10952, 11336, 12069, 16364, 18704) are on record within the 1-mile search radius of the
proposed RGC Igloo House Primary tower site and its associated access and utility corridors (see
Figure A-8). All of the archaeological investigations consisted of surveys. The record
associated with one of the investigations (561) suggests that some limited testing was also done.
None of the surveys overlapped with the proposed RGC Igloo House Primary tower site or its
associated access and utility corridor (THC 2016).
5.1.13.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
Twenty-one previously recorded archaeological resources (41SR92, 41SR132, 41SR180,

41SR393) are within the 1-mile search radius for the proposed RGC Igloo House Primary tower
site and its associated access and utility corridor (see Figure A-8). None of the archaeological
sites overlap with the footprint of the RGC Igloo House Primary tower site or its associated
access and utility corridor (see Figure A-8) (THC 2016).
5.1.13.3 Previously Recorded Historic Resources
One NRHP-listed property (Roma-San Pedro International Bridge), one NRHP-listed district
(Roma Historic District), and 10 OTHMs (Guerra Manuel Store [3200], Memorial Hospital
[3324], Old Garcia Home [3734], Our Lady of Refuge Catholic Church [3885], Ramirez Hall
[4174], Old Roma Convent Building [4342], Noah Cox House [6055], Knights of Columbus Hall
[6058], Early Commercial Center [6062], and Heinrich Portscheller [16204]) are on record
within the 1-mile search radius of the proposed RGC Igloo House Primary tower site and its
associated access and utility corridor and within the 0.5-mile visual APE of the tower site (see
Figure A-8). All but one of the markers (Heinrich Portscheller [16204]) are registered RTHLs.
The Roma NRHP-listed historic district, also known as Roma-Los Saenz, is a fifteen block area
located on a bluff above the Rio Grande. The southwestern, boundary of the Roma Historic
District is formed by Hidalgo Street between Garfield and Zaragosa streets, a straight line from
the intersection of Zaragosa and Hidalgo streets to the bluff above the Rio Grande; the boundary
line then follows the edge of the bluff along the Rio Grande. The southeastern boundary of the
district runs from the International Bridge crossing the Rio Grande through the middle of the
block bounded by Juarez Alley, Estrella Street, Bravo Alley and Hidalgo Street, to the mid- point
of the block bounded by Juarez Alley, Grant Street, Bravo Alley, and Estrella Street. The
northeastern boundary is formed by a line bisecting the blocks between the above-mentioned
southeastern corner to a point at Garfield Street equidistant between Grant and Estrella streets.
The northwest boundary runs from this point to the intersection of Garfield Street equidistant
between Grant and Estrella streets. The northwest boundary runs from this point to the
intersection of Garfield and Hidalgo streets. Roma-Los Saenz, located on a high bluff above the
Rio Grande, in the extreme southern portion of Star County across the border from Mier,
Mexico, was originally a part of Jose de Escandon's colony. The first of Escandon's settlement in
the lower Rio Grande was founded in February, 1749, and it was named "Nuestra Senora de
Santa Ana de Camargo". In succession by 1753, Reynosa, Dolores and Revilla (Guerrero) and
Mier were established. In 1760 three members of this colony settled on the bluff at Roma,

naming their new community "Buena Vista." The present name of "Roma" was adopted by 1848,
after Texas had become a state in the Union. Roma was an important shipping point on the Rio
Grande and mercantile enterprises flourished until steamships were outmoded by the railroads
and highways. The era between the Mexican War and the Civil War, as well as the
Reconstruction Years, brought growth and prosperity to the community. Particularly during the
later period the town had a colorful history. The smuggling of contraband became a highly
organized and, if not completely respected, a condoned flourishing business that amounted to
hundreds of thousands of dollars. Today, the charm and character of the town results largely
from these homes and stores, many of which are superb brick structures designed and built by
Enrique Portscheller, a builder and master brick mason. The structures, with their classical
entablatures and pilasters of molded brick, which Portscheller built in Roma between the early
1880s and 1894, are a unique and sophisticated collection of buildings on the south Texas
border.

Highway 83 south, down the border to Brownsville, Texas. An in situ portion of the original
roadbed was recorded during a previous investigation of site 41HG177 which consisted of
aligned, rounded cobbles and associated large pieces of cedar at a depth of 46 cmbs. The
assessment of the site at that time determined that the historic Military Road is eligible for listing
in the NRHP on its own merit under Criteria A and D, and may be a component of a potential
National Register Archaeological District associated with Mexican American War Battlefield
Sites. The site is recorded as 41SR397 in Starr County, Texas, and as 41HG230 in Hidalgo

of the road within Starr County, Texas and site 41HG230 representing the portion of the site
within Hidalgo County, Texas. A description of the sites is presented in section 5.1.29.2. The
portion recorded as 41SR397 has no determination evaluation on record and is considered to be
of unknown eligibility pending consultation with the THC. The portion of the site within
Hidalgo County that is recorded as 41HG230 has three separate eligibility determinations on
record. The earliest determination, made in 2010, assigns the site an undetermined eligibility for
the NRHP. Two subsequent eligibility determinations found portions of site 41HG230 that were
within the right-of-way of the existing road to be ineligible for the NRHP. The eligibility of the
portion of the site that is adjacent to the utility corridor is considered to have an undetermined
eligibility pending further consultation with the THC.

project (13181) and one archaeological monitoring project (18439) (THC 2016).
Three of the archaeological investigations (9370, 9371, and 18417) overlap with the footprint of
the proposed MCS GF Military Area Alternate tower site (THC 2016). The first two
investigation (9370 and 9371) consisted of surveys that were conducted for the Texas Water
Development Board (TWDB) in 1999 under Texas Antiquities Permit number 2105. No
additional information was available about these surveys as there were no specific abstracts
associated with the atlas numbers. The third project (18417) consisted of an intensive survey
conducted in 2010 for the TWDB under Texas Antiquities Permit 5791 as part of the Agua
Special Utility District Wastewater line. While the record for 18417 states that the investigation
was an intensive survey, the abstract associated with the permit number states that the project
consisted of archaeological monitoring of 1.4 km (0.9 mile) of open trenching. It was noted that
another investigation (18439) within the 1-mile search radius is listed as an archaeological
monitoring project and shares the same Texas Antiquities Permit number. It is unclear whether
they are part of the same project with the information available.

One NRHP-listed historic district (La Lomita Historic District) and five OTHMs (831, 2872,
2997, 2998, and 5009) are recorded within the 1-mile search radius of the proposed MCS
Madero Primary tower location and its associated access and utility corridors. One of the
OTHMs (La Lomita Chapel [2997]) designates an RTHL. The proposed MCS Madero Primary
tower site is within the NRHP-listed district (La Lomita Historic District) and four of the
OTHMs (2872, 2997, 2998, and 5009) are with the 0.5-mile visual APE of the proposed MCS
Madero Primary tower site (see Figure A-29) (THC 2016).
La Lomita Historic District
The La Lomita Historic District is bordered by a small section of the Rio Grande River and
Levee Road on the west side, an unnamed service road to the northwest, South Farm-to-Market
Road 494 to the northeast, and a section of farmland to the southeast. The district contains the
La Lomita Chapel, 122 acres of the original ranch lands of the Oblate Fathers, and St. Peter’s
Novitiate. The property contains a rise of approximately 25 feet, giving the area the name “La
Lomita,” or “little hill.” The hillside is interlaced with trees, grass, and brush. The ruin of St.
Peter’s Novitiate sits at the highest point of the site. The Mission-style building was built in
1912 and originally consisted of a low-pitched tiled roof ending in a curvilinear gable on the
north (primary) façade. On the right and left sides of the gable were twin towers with arched
openings and pyramidal terracotta-tiled roofs. Between the two towers was a central bay which
contained a triple-arched entry on the first floor, while the second floor featured carved brackets
on each corner of the balcony. The first floor also contained four semicircular arches and four
segmental arches formed the gallery on the second floor. The east, west, and south façades
consisted of an arcade of semicircular arches on the first floor. All that remains of this structure
is the north façade. The structure was destroyed by a fire in 2009. According to research, the
site surrounding St. Peter’s Novitiate included a two-story frame house that housed an order of
nuns, bunkhouses for students and workers, and a dining hall. La Lomita Historic District was
nominated as a district because the 122-acre farm, in addition to being the location of La Lomita
Mission and St. Peter’s Novitiate, played a significant role in the settling of the area and the
eventual establishment of the town of Mission, Texas.

survey and the other investigation is listed as a reconnaissance and investigation (13841) (THC
2016).
One archaeological investigation (13841) overlaps with a portion of the MCS MacPump Primary
tower site. The survey consisted of a reconnaissance trenching and geomorphic study within the
a proposed levee expansion footprint, supplemented by 100 percent pedestrian survey, intensive
shovel testing, and backhoe trenching in areas with a high probability for historic or prehistoric
resources. The survey did not identify any archaeological resources within the footprint of the
MCS MacPump Primary tower site (THC 2016).
5.2.17.2 Previously Recorded Archaeological Resources
One previously recorded archaeological resource (41HG230) is within the 1-mile search radius

5.2.17.3 Previously Recorded Historic Resources
One NRHP-listed historic district (Louisiana-Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System), is
recorded within the 1-mile search radius of the proposed MCS MacPump Primary tower location
and its associated access and utility corridor and within the 0.5-mile visual APE of the proposed
MCS MacPump Primary tower site (see Figure A-31) (THC 2016). The Louisiana–Rio Grande
Canal Company Irrigation System is also known as the Hidalgo County Water District Number
2. The historic district consists of two pump houses and an extensive network of aboveground
and below ground irrigation canals dispersed over 12,686.9 ha (31,350 ac) of the south-central
portion of the county, encompassing the major population centers of Hidalgo, San Juan,
McAllen, Pharr, Alamo, and southern Edinburg. The canal system had its origin with the Rio
Grande Valley Reservoir and Irrigation Company founded by John Closner in 1904 to irrigate his
plantation in San Juan. Mr. Closner’s canal system was integrated into the newly incorporated
Louisiana–Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System in 1910. The initial focus of the
Louisiana–Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System was to service large-scale sugarcane
interests. The success of this endeavor was short-lived when, in 1912, a freeze heavily damaged
the cane crop, and alkali levels in the soil were found to be too high to sustain long-term success
of the crop if replanted. Despite the demise of the sugarcane, the Louisiana–Rio Grande Canal
Company promoted the use of the irrigated lands for a variety of agricultural uses, including

alfalfa, truck produce, corn, citrus, and other fruits. Eventually, the Louisiana–Rio Grande Canal
Company sold the irrigation system to the Hidalgo County Water Improvement District Number
2 in 1920, becoming publicly owned. A second boom in the economy occurred with the success
of citrus growing as a result of the irrigated lands from the 1910s to 1949. The citrus industry
also suffered a fatal setback when a hard freeze destroyed the majority of citrus trees in the area
in 1949. Since this period, agriculture has become more diversified in the area. The Louisiana–
Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System is significant due to its transformation of the area
from an arid mesquite- and brush-covered landscape dominated by a low population of ranchers
to a productive agricultural valley providing the catalyst for transportation and railroad
construction and an influx of new settlers forming the towns of Hidalgo, San Juan, McAllen,
Pharr, Alamo, and Edinburg during the early twentieth century (THC 1995). As such, the
irrigation system is significant at the state level under Criterion A for its contributions to the
development and irrigated farming in the Lower RGV of Texas (THC 1995). Additionally, the
first lift pump house is nominated for NRHP listing under Criterion C for its architecture and
engineering because it retains its original Mission Revival façade and steam pumping machinery
(THC 1995).
5.2.18 MCS MacPump Alternate
5.2.18.1 Previously Conducted Archaeological Investigations
Two previously conducted archaeological investigations (13841 and 63845) are on record within
the 1-mile search radius of the proposed MCS MacPump Alternate tower site and its associated

2016).
Both archaeological investigations (13841 and 63845) overlap with portions of the access
corridor associated with the MCS MacPump Alternate tower site. The first survey (13841)
consisted of a trenching and geomorphic study within the a proposed levee expansion footprint,
supplemented by 100 percent pedestrian survey, intensive shovel testing, and backhoe trenching
in areas with a high probability for historic or prehistoric resources. The second investigation
(63845) consisted of an archaeological survey of four road segments near the City of Mission for
CBP in 2014. The surveys did not identify any archaeological resources within the footprint of
the access corridor for the MCS MacPump Alternate tower site (THC 2016).

corridors (see Figure A-35) (THC 2016).
One of the previously recorded archaeological sites (41HG162) is adjacent to the northern
portion of the access corridor associated with the proposed WSL Phar POE South Tertiary
Option 1 tower site. Site 41HG162 consists of a late nineteenth to early twentieth century
historic farmstead site. Artifacts present at the site consisted of brick fragments, whiteware
sherds, decorated porcelain sherds, sherds of plain Mexican utility wares, bottle glass, window
glass, and a glass toy marble. No features were recorded at the site. The site was found to be
heavily disturbed and was estimated to be 0 percent intact. The associated eligibility
determination record for site 41HG162 indicates that the SHPO determined the site was
ineligible for the NRHP in their review conducted in July 1994 (THC 2016). One additional
archaeological site (41HG163) is adjacent to the footprint of the WSL Pharr POE South Tertiary
Option 1 tower site. That site consisted of an early to middle twentieth century historic house
site. Artifacts recorded at the site were sparse and included lead-glazed stoneware sherds,
whiteware sherds, porcelain sherds, glass shards including a possible milk bottle finish, fibertempered tile, brick, and mussel shell fragments. No features were recorded at site 41HG163.
The site had little integrity and was not recommended eligible for the NRHP or as a State
Archaeological Landmark. An associated eligibility determination record shows that the site was
determined not eligible for the NRHP during a review conducted in July 1994.

Two of the archaeological resources overlap with the access and utility corridor footprints for the
proposed Retamal South Primary tower site. The first site (41HG35) consists of a scatter of a
large quantity of bricks across an area measuring 250 feet by 50 feet. The site was recorded in
1972. At the time it was recorded the site was situated in an open plowed field. The landowner
stated that the site used to be an area utilized as a brick kiln. The recorder in 1972 recommended
additional testing for the site. There is no associated eligibility determination record for the site
and the site is considered to have an undetermined NRHP eligibility pending additional
consultation with the THC. The second archaeological resource (41HG230) overlaps with the
northern terminus of the access corridor associated with the proposed WSL Retamal South

CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS

Archaeological resource surveys were conducted for all the proposed tower sites, as well as their
associated access and utility corridors. Twenty-eight new archaeological sites were recorded
during the archaeological surveys. In addition to the newly recorded archaeological sites, two
previously recorded archaeological sites were revisited and updated. Historic resource surveys
were conducted for all the proposed tower sites where there was a potential for effects on
historic-age resources within the visual APE of the proposed tower. The results of these
investigations are presented below and organized by AOR and tower site.
6.1

RIO GRANDE STATION AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY

A total of 31 proposed tower sites along with their associated utility and access corridors were
surveyed for archaeological and historic resources within the Rio Grande Station AOR. An
additional four relocated tower sites were surveyed for RGC Inside Mustang Gate Chapeno
Alternate, RGC Speedios Escobares Tertiary Option 1,RGC Near Blas Chapas La Puerta
Primary, and RGC North of Silvertanks Military Road Primary tower sites. In addition, several
realigned access roads were also subject to survey after the original access roads were surveyed.
A total of 25 archaeological sites were recorded during the surveys conducted within the Rio
Grande City Station AOR. Another two previously recorded archaeological sites were revisited
and updated. Summaries of the results of the archaeological and historical resource surveys are
outlined in the following sections by tower.
6.1.1 RGC Inside Mustang Gate Chapeno Alternate
6.1.1.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The RGC Inside Mustang Gate Chapeno Alternate original tower site was located within a
heavily disturbed area that was used as a gas or oil well (see Photographs B-1 to B-8). Unused
pipes were located across the tower site and the pad itself was elevated with approximately 4 feet
of fill. In addition, the access road and access and utility corridor were both already located on
an existing maintained road which encompassed both the 30-foot access corridor and 60-foot
access and utility corridor. Surface visibility along the access and utility corridors and the tower
pad was excellent (~90 percent). Given the existing disturbance at the original tower site, the
overall good ground visibility, and low potential for subsurface deposits the RGC Inside
Mustang Gate Chapeno Alternate tower site and associated access and utility corridors were
subject to intensive pedestrian survey and no supplemental shovel testing was conducted.
After the initial survey of the RGC Inside Mustang Gate Chapeno Alternate tower site location,
the tower site was moved to the east in order to avoid potential hazardous material associated
with the original tower site. The RGC Inside Mustang Gate Chapeno Alternate (relocated) tower
site was also subjected to an intensive pedestrian survey (see Photographs B-9 to B-16). In
addition, the pedestrian survey was supplemented with the excavation of three STPs (T1-ST1 to
T1-ST3) across the tower site (Table 6-1; see Figure A-44). No archaeological resources were
found in either the original or relocated tower sites and no additional archaeological
investigations are recommended for this tower site or its associated access and utility corridors.

6.1.1.2 Historic Resource Investigations
The previously recorded Chapeno Cemetery (Cemetery ID No. SR-C053) is not located within
the visual APE, but is located on the southeast side of the access road (Chapeno Road),
approximately 0.85 km (0.53 mile) southwest from the center of the proposed tower site. No
established date is known. It is approximately 1.15 acres and is surrounded by a 3-foot wire
fence with wood post supports. A metal gate sits at the west (primary) side of the cemetery. The
tower site is visible from all points in the cemetery but does not constitute as an adverse visual
element, however, it is recommended that the utility corridor be placed on the opposite side of
the access road to avoid disturbing the cemetery. Additional structures present in the visual APE
consist of small residential buildings and utility structures.
Cemetery Chapeno-2
One newly recorded aboveground/architectural historic resource, a cemetery (Chapeno-2), was
recorded during the survey of the proposed RGC Inside Mustang Gate Chapeno Alternate tower
site and its associated access and utility corridors (see Figure A-45). The unnamed cemetery is
0.13 km (0.8 mile) southwest from the center of the proposed tower site on the southeast side of
the access road. Cemetery Chapeno-1 measures approximately 18 feet north to south by 14 feet
east to west and has an estimated area of 261 square feet (see Photograph B-17). The cemetery
is bounded by a low (3-foot-high) rock wall made from local stone and clay grout.
Three headstones were recorded within the cemetery. Headstone 1 (HS-1), the northernmost
headstone, is made of concrete and is broken apart and incomplete (see Photograph B-18). A
fragment from the headstone had a crucifix and dove motif embossed on its surface. Given the
orientation of HS-1, the headstone marks an east-to-west oriented grave. Headstone 2 (HS-19) is
an intact headstone, crucifix in form and made of rock and concrete (see Photograph B-20).
Given the orientation of HS-2 the headstone marks an east-to-west oriented grave. The third
headstone (HS-3) is the southernmost headstone and is made of concrete. HS-3 is partially
broken apart but most likely is crucifix in form (see Photograph B-21). Given the orientation of
HS-3 it marks a north-to-south oriented grave.
The Chapeno-2 cemetery is not mapped in the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and no additional
information is known about the cemetery. The proposed tower site is visible from the cemetery,
but is not considered an adverse visual element due to the presence of existing towers. It is
recommended that the access road be moved or the utility corridor be placed on the opposite side
of the access road to avoid disturbing the cemetery in any way.

6.1.2 RGC North of Bench Landing Salineno Primary
6.1.2.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The archaeological survey of the RGC North of Bench landing Salineno Primary Tower site and
its associated access and utility corridor consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey
supplemented with the excavation of three STPs at the proposed tower site (T1-STP1 to T2STP3) and the excavation of four STPs along the proposed access and utility corridor (T2-STP1
to T2-STP4) (see Photographs B-21 to B-28). Modern material associated with dumping from a
residential area to the east of the survey corridor was noted in the two initial STPs excavated
along the access and utility corridor. All of the material was determined to be modern in the
field and discarded. As a result, none of the STPs were positive for historic or prehistoric
cultural material (Table 6-2; see Figure A-46). A surface scatter of prehistoric artifacts was
noted across the proposed RGC North of Bench Landing Salineno Primary tower site and was
recorded as archaeological site 41SR444.

the surface scatter but none of the STPs were positive for cultural material (Table 6-3; see Figure
A-47). A typical shovel test profile for a STP excavated within the site boundary consisted of a
light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy clay to a depth of 50 cmbgs. Given the excellent
ground visibility and lack of subsurface deposits, the site was defined by the surface expression
of artifacts. Site delineation was confined largely to the proposed tower location survey
boundaries, but a limited surface reconnaissance was conducted along the landform extending to
the north and northwest. Additional cultural material was noted to the north and northwest and
the site extends beyond the survey limits to the north. As a result, the site boundaries, as
currently defined, are considered incomplete. The portion of the site recorded measures 55
meters by 58 meters and has a total area of 1,567 square meters. The site is positioned on a low
terrace that overlooks a junction of two unnamed arroyos to the south (see Photograph B-29).
Vegetation at the site was dominated by an understory of buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris) and an
overstory of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and huisache (Acacia farnesiana).

Large cobble at the base obstructing further

Artifacts recorded from the surface during the delineation of the site were dominated by lithic
debitage (30 primary flakes, 59 secondary flakes, 164 tertiary flakes, and 23 pieces of angular
debris) of chert, basalt, rhyolite, and chalcedony. In addition to lithic debitage, several chert
stone tools were recorded from the surface, including one unhafted biface fragment (T.1
Photographs B-30 and B-31), two multidirectional core tools (T.2 and T.3; see Photographs B-32
to B-35), and one unifacial flake tool (T.4). None of the artifacts recorded from the surface were
diagnostic of a particular temporal period or culture. One feature was noted during the
delineation of the site, which consisted of a thermally altered rock concentration of 25 fragments
within and area measuring 50 centimeters north-south by 65 centimeters east-west (see
Photograph B-36). In addition to the material comprising the feature, nine fragments of
thermally altered rock were noted across the site area, which suggests that other thermal features
may be present. Given the artifact assemblage and feature, the site probably represents a
repeated-use, open campsite. The site may have the potential to address research questions
regarding prehistoric adaptations in south Texas including stone tool manufacture, resource
processing, and subsistence. The current archaeological investigations were limited to the survey
area of the tower site and additional portions of the site extend outside the current survey
boundary to the north and northwest. As a result, the site has the potential to provide
information on prehistoric adaptations in the area and the eligibility of the site for the NRHP is
unknown.

6.1.2.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One previously recorded aboveground/architectural historic resource was examined within the
visual APE of the proposed RGC N of Bench Landing Salineno Primary tower site. The
Salineno Cemetery (Cemetery ID No. SR-C057) (see Photograph B-37) is located 0.49 km (0.31
mile) north from the center of the tower site. No established date is known. It is approximately
27 acres and is surrounded by a 3-foot-tall chain-link fence. A chainlink gate with red brick
posts and a cast-iron sign that reads CEMETERIO CATOLICO DE SALINENO TEXAS sits on
the west (primary) side of the cemetery. A flagpole sits to the left of the gate. The tower site is
likely to be visible all points in the cemetery, but does not constitute as an adverse visual effect.
Additional structures present in the visual APE consist of small residential and commercial
buildings.

excavation of 20 STPs along the proposed access and utility corridor (T2-STP1 to T2-STP20)
(see Photographs B-46 to B-52). None of the transect STPs were positive for cultural material
(Table 6-5; see Figure A-49). Two surface scatters of artifacts were noted during the survey
resulting in the recording of one archaeological site (41SR438) and one isolated occurrence (IO)

The site was originally recorded from a surface scatter of artifacts found within the footprint of
an unimproved dirt road. Surface visibility within the road was good to excellent (90 to 100
percent), but quickly dropped to poor (0 to 10 percent) outside of the dirt road footprint. An

additional five shovel tests were excavated outside of the dirt road, within the area of poor
surface visibility, none of which were positive for cultural material (Table 6-6). As a result, the
site boundary was determined from the surface expression of artifacts alone (see Figure A-50).
The site, as currently defined, measures 52 meters north to south by 12 meters east to west and
has a total site area of 373 square meters. The soil profile from one of the delineation shovel
tests excavated near the center of the site (D-5) consisted of a single stratum, Stratum I, a
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay loam to depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface at which
point the soil became too compact for further excavation.

The site is positioned on an upland flat that slopes very gentle to the south and east to a tributary
of the Arroyo de los Mudos. Vegetation at the site is dominated by an overstory of honey
mesquite and an understory of buffelgrass (see Photograph B-53).
All the artifacts recorded at the site were recorded from the disturbed roadbed. Artifacts
recorded at the site were dominated by lithic debitage (two primary flakes, four secondary flakes,
14 tertiary flakes, and five shatter) of chert. A single stone tool (T.1), a hafted biface, was also
recorded at the site (see Photograph B-54 and B-55). The hafted biface could not be identified to
a known type and may represent a preform. Given the limited artifact assemblage, the site
probably represents a single-occupation, open campsite where very limited resource processing
may have taken place. Given the site's limited artifact assemblage, the site has little or no
potential to answer questions regarding prehistoric settlement, subsistence, and resource
processing in south Texas.
IO-BlueandWhite-P-1
The IO (IO-BlueandWhite-P-1) was originally recorded from a sparse surface scatter of lithic
material noted within the existing road (see Photograph B-56). The surface artifact assemblage
consisted of a distal biface fragment (see Photograph B-57 and B-58) and two tertiary flakes of
chert. An additional five delineation STPs (D-1 to D-5) were excavated around the surface
scatter but no additional artifacts were recovered (Table 6-7; see Figure A-51). Given the limited
number of artifacts that were found in a disturbed context, the locus is considered to be an IO
and is recommended not eligible for the NRHP.

6.1.4.2 Historic Resource Investigations
No previously recorded aboveground/architectural resources that are listed in the NRHP or
eligible for listing in the NRHP are located within the visual APE of the proposed RGC South of
Blue White Pipes Primary tower site and along its access road. There are no visible structures
present in the APE.
6.1.5 RGC South of Blue White Pipes Alternate
6.1.5.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The archaeological survey of the RGC South of Blue White Pipes Alternate tower site and its
associated access and utility corridor consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey supplemented
with the excavation of three STPs at the proposed tower site (T1-STP1 to T2-STP3) and the
excavation of eight STPs along a 0.5-mile portion of the proposed access and utility corridor
(T2-STP1 to T2-STP8) (see Photographs B-59 to B-63). The remainder of the access and utility
corridor had natural gas pipelines adjacent to both sides of the road, which prevented the
excavation of STPs along this portion. None of the transect STPs were positive for cultural
material (Table 6-8; see Figure A-52). Four surface scatters of artifacts were noted during the
survey that resulted in the recording of four archaeological sites, 41SR434, 41SR435, 41SR436
and 41SR437.

41SR434 (BlueandWhite-A-1)
Site 41SR434 was originally located from a surface scatter noted at transect STP 2-1 along the
access/utility corridor for the proposed tower site. An additional six delineation STPs were
excavated at the site, none of which were positive for cultural material (Table 6-9). The soil
profile consisted of a single stratum of pale brown (10YR 6/3) silt loam that extended to a depth
of 50 centimeters below ground surface before encountering a shale-like bedrock. Surface
visibility at the site was good to excellent (70 to 80 percent). Given the good surface visibility
and lack of any subsurface artifacts, the site boundaries were determined by the surface
expression of artifacts. Site delineation was limited to the west by a fence and property line and
to the east by the limits of the survey corridor. A reconnaissance of the edge of the survey area
noted that additional artifacts extended beyond the survey corridor to the east. As a result, the
site boundary is considered incomplete and the site extends to the east. The portion of the site
recorded within the survey corridor measures 40 meters north-south by 30 meters east-west and
has a total site area of 750 square meters (see Figure A-53).

Notes

The site is positioned on a slight rise of a terrace that overlooks a tributary of Arroyo la Minita to
the east and north (Photograph B-64). Vegetation at the site was typical of thorn scrub brush
lands and is dominated by blackbrush acacia (Acacia rigidula) and lotebush (Ziziphus
obtusifolia). Other vegetation noted near the site includes guayacan (Guaiacum angustifolium),
bee brush (Aloysia gratissima), and Texas ranger (Leucophyllum frutescens). An understory of
buffelgrass is noted across the site becoming dense adjacent to the existing road. The landform
rises slightly to the east of the access road before dropping down into the arroyo. A tributary for
Arroyo La Minita lies 50 meters to the east and the main channel of the Arroyo lies 200 meters
to the north.

No subsurface artifacts were noted in any of the seven STPs that were excavated across the site.
Artifacts recorded from the surface included lithic debitage (four primary, 13 secondary, 10
tertiary, and six angular debris) and stone tools (one hafted biface [Early Triangular] [T.1], one
unhafted biface [T.2], one unhafted unifacial flake tool, and two core tools [1 possible end
scraper T.3]) (see Photographs B-65 to B-70). A possible deflated thermal feature, composed of
12 thermally altered rocks scattered across a 3-meter-diameter area, was recorded at the site just
outside of the survey corridor (see Photograph B-71). The presence of an Early Triangular
hafted biface would tentatively date the occupation of the site to the Early Archaic period. Given
the artifact assemblage and the one feature recorded, the site probably represents an Early
Archaic open campsite. Artifacts were more heavily concentrated near the eastern boundary of
the survey corridor and were noted extending beyond the survey corridor to the east. Given the
presence of stone tools, diagnostic artifacts, and a potential thermal feature, the site is considered
to have good potential to answer questions regarding prehistoric settlement and adaptation in the
area, including possible subsistence information. The site is recommended for additional
archaeological testing and is recommended to have an undetermined eligibility for the NRHP
until additional testing is conducted to determine its eligibility for the NRHP.
41SR435 (BlueandWhite-A-2)
Site 41SR435 was originally recorded from the observation of surface material near a transect
STP (2-3). Six additional delineation STPs (D-1 to D-6) were excavated across the site, one of
which was positive for subsurface cultural material (Table 6-10; see Figure A-54). As a result,
the site was delineated predominantly by the surface expression of artifacts. A typical shovel test
profile from a delineation STP (D-3) excavated within the site boundary consisted of a pale
brown (10YR 6/3) clay to a depth of 45 centimeters below ground surface before encountering
bedrock shale. Site delineation was limited to the west by a fence and property line, and to the
east by the survey boundary, which was set 60 feet east of the centerline of the existing
unimproved road. A reconnaissance of the eastern edge of the survey corridor noted additional
artifacts extending beyond the survey corridor to the east and the site boundaries are not
considered complete. The site, as currently defined, measures 69 meters north to south by 40
meters east to west and has a total site area of 1,812 square meters.

current survey area. Vegetation noted at the site was consistent with vegetation typical of thorn
scrub brush lands and is dominated by blackbrush acacia and lotebush. Other vegetation noted
near the site includes guayacan, bee brush, and Texas ranger. An understory of buffelgrass is
noted across the site becoming dense adjacent to the existing road.
All artifacts recorded at the site were from the surface. No subsurface artifacts were noted in the
transect or delineation STPs excavated at the site. Artifacts recovered from the site were limited
to lithic debitage (eight primary, 23 secondary, 65 tertiary, and two angular debris) of chert.
Stone tools recorded at the site included two core tools of chert. Additional artifacts were noted
outside of the survey corridor continuing uphill to the east. Given the limited artifact assemblage
within the recorded portion of the site, the site probably represents a short-term, singleoccupation open campsite of unknown cultural affiliation. Given the moderate artifact density
and presence of stone tools, the site has the potential to provide information on prehistoric
settlement and resource procurement in south Texas. Because of the limitation of the survey
corridor, only a portion of the site was delineated and additional archaeological investigations
would be needed to determine the site's eligibility for the NRHP.
41SR436 (BlueandWhite-A-3)
Site 41SR436 was originally recorded from the observation of surface material within the road
where it shifts from the west side of a fence line to the east side of a fence line. One transect
STP excavated within the boundaries of the site was negative for subsurface cultural material.
An additional five delineation STPs (D-1 to D-4) were excavated across the site, but none were
positive for cultural material (Table 6-11; see Figure A-55). A typical soil profile from a
delineation STP (D-2) excavated within the site boundary consisted of an upper stratum of light
gray (10YR 7/2) dry clay to a depth of 20 centimeters below ground surface followed by a
brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) clay from 20 to 50 centimeters below ground surface. Given the
lack of subsurface cultural material, the site was delineated by the surface expression of artifacts.
Site delineation was limited to the west and east by a fence and property lines and the survey
corridor boundaries, which were set 60 feet east and west of the centerline of the existing
unimproved road. A reconnaissance of the eastern edge of the survey corridor noted additional
artifacts extending beyond the survey corridor to the east and the site boundaries are not
considered complete. The site, as currently defined, measures 129 meters north to south by 30
meters east to west and has a total site area of 1,854 square meters.

The site is on a low terrace situated east of a confluence of Arroyo la Minita and one of its minor
tributaries (see Photograph B-73). The site occupies a relatively flat area that rises very
gradually to the east and north beyond the current survey corridor. Vegetation noted at the site
was consistent with vegetation typical of thorn scrub brush lands.
All artifacts recorded at the site were from the surface. No subsurface artifacts were noted in the
transect or delineation STPs excavated at the site. Artifacts recovered from the site were limited
to lithic debitage (four primary, seven secondary, 13 tertiary, two angular debris, and two tested
cobbles) of chert. No stone tools, diagnostic material, or features were recorded at the site.
Additional artifacts were noted outside of the survey corridor continuing to the east. Given the
limited artifact assemblage within the recorded portion of the site, the site probably represents a
short-term, single-occupation open campsite. Given the light artifact assemblage, the portion of
the site within the survey corridor has little or no potential to provide significant information on
the prehistoric settlement and adaptations in south Texas. While the recorded portion of the site
is limited, only a portion of the site was within the survey corridor and recorded. As a result,
additional work would be needed to determine the eligibility of the site for listing in the NRHP.
41SR437 (BlueandWhite-A-4)
Site 41SR437 is located on a broad, very gently sloping terrace that overlooks the main channel
of Arroyo la Minita to the west. The site is located on both sides of the road. Five additional
STPs (D-1 to D-5) were excavated during the delineation of the site (Table 6-12; see Figure A56). Transect and delineation STPs excavated within the site area failed to record any subsurface
cultural material. In addition, the disturbed area of the road widens within the site, taking up 40
feet of the 60-foot access/utility survey corridor. Given the lack of subsurface artifacts and good
ground visibility (80 to 90 percent), the site was delineated by the surface expression of artifacts
alone. Site delineation was limited to the 60-foot access/utility survey corridor. As a result, the
site may extend outside of the survey corridor. The site, as currently defined, measures 183
meters north to south by 106 meters east to west and has a total site area of 5,517 square meters.
Vegetation at the site is typical of thorn scrub brush lands (see Photograph B-74 and B-75).

In addition, the surface of the site was visibly disturbed with evidence of push piles of dirt
extending 40 feet from the road leaving only about 43 percent of the site intact as it is currently
delineated. Artifacts recorded at the site were dominated by lithic debitage (18 primary flakes,

17 secondary flakes, 30 tertiary flakes, and seven angular debris/shatter) and a single unhafted
biface (see Photographs B-76 and B-77). All lithic material was chert.
Given the lack of integrity and extremely low artifact density, the portion of the site within the
survey corridor has little or no potential to address research questions regarding prehistoric
settlement and adaptations in south Texas. Only a portion of the site has been recorded as part of
this survey and more substantial and intact deposits may exist outside of the current survey
corridor. As a result, the site is recommended to have an unknown eligibility for the NRHP until
additional investigations can be conducted at the site outside of the current survey corridor.

41SR432 (3CarGarage-P-1)
The site was originally recorded from a surface scatter of artifacts. Three transect STPs (T1STP1 to T1-STP3) and three delineation STPs (D-1 to D-3) were excavated across the area of the
surface scatter, but none of the STPs were positive for cultural material (Table 6-14). A typical
shovel test profile for a STP excavated within the site boundary consisted of a dark yellowish
brown (10YR 4/4) silt loam to a depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface. None of the
shovel tests excavated was positive for cultural material. Given the excellent ground visibility
and lack of evidence of subsurface deposits, the site was defined by the surface expression of
artifacts. Site delineation was limited to the survey corridor and the site may extend beyond the
survey limits. As a result, the site boundaries, as currently defined, are considered incomplete.
The portion of the site recorded measures 59 meters north to south by 216 meters east to west
and has a total area of 3,521 square meters (see Figure A-58). The site is positioned on the
western slope of a very gently sloping upland hill. Vegetation at the site was dominated by an
understory of buffelgrass and an overstory of honey mesquite.

Artifacts recorded during the delineation of the site were dominated by lithic debitage (19
primary flakes, 19 secondary flakes, 63 tertiary flakes, and 11 shatter). In addition to lithic
debitage, several stone tools were recorded from the surface, including one core tool, two
unhafted bifaces, and one unimarginal flake tool (see Photographs B-82 to B-84). None of the
artifacts recorded from the surface were diagnostic of any particular temporal period or culture.
No features were recorded during the delineation of the site. Given the artifact assemblage, the
site probably represents a single-occupation open campsite. The site may have the potential to
address research questions regarding prehistoric adaptations in south Texas, including stone tool
manufacture and resource processing. While the density of artifacts is light across the site,
investigations were limited to the survey corridor and additional portions of the site may extend

unknown.
41SR433 (3CarGarage-P-3)
Site 41SR433 was initially recorded from a single positive transect STP (T2-STP3). An
additional eight delineation STPs were excavated (D-1 to D-8), of which four (D-2, D-4, D-5,
and D-6) were positive for cultural material (Table 6-15; see Figure A-59). Cultural material
was recovered from depths ranging from 10 to 60 cmbgs surface. Site delineation was limited to
the survey corridor, so additional STPs were not excavated to the east or west of the 60-foot
access and utility corridor (see Photograph B-85). Outside of the roadway, surface visibility was
very poor (0 to 5 percent). As a result, the site was delineated by positive and negative STPs
alone. Given the fact that the excavation of STPs were confined to the current survey corridor,
the site potentially extends beyond the current survey corridor to the east and west. The portion
of the site within the survey corridor measures 74 meters north to south by 24 meters east to west
and has a total site area of 1,188 square meters.

The artifact assemblage from the site consisted of lithic debitage (two secondary flakes and eight
tertiary flakes) and a single stone tool consisting of a unimarginal flake tool (Photograph B-86).
All artifacts were recovered from STPs. Given the presence of possible intact deposits to a depth
of 60 centimeters below ground surface including stone tools, the site is thought to have the
potential to address research questions regarding prehistoric settlement and resource processing
in south Texas. Since the current investigations were limited to the survey corridor, additional
testing would be required to determine the eligibility of the site for the NRHP.

41SR428 (3CarGarage-A-1)
The site was originally recorded from the surface scatter of artifacts and one positive transect
STP (T1-STP3). An additional three STPs were excavated (D-1 to D-3), none of which were
positive for cultural material (Table 6-18; see Figure A-62). The site had good to excellent
surface visibility (60 percent) along its southern portion, near the top of the landform, but
reduced to poor (0 to 10 percent) surface visibility along the northern slope of the landforms (see
Photograph B-91). Given the limited subsurface material found, the site's boundaries were
largely determined by the surface expression of artifacts. Impacts on the site include an
unimproved road that cuts through the western portion of the site, a possible pipeline corridor
that cuts through the eastern portion of the site, and erosion of the hill. The soil profile of the
STP that was positive for cultural material consisted of a single stratum that was a very pale
brown (10YR 7/3) silty clay loam to a depth of 40 centimeters below ground surface. Vegetation
at the site consisted of a predominantly honey mesquite overstory and buffelgrass understory.

Artifacts recovered from the site included lithic debitage (six primary flakes, 16 secondary
flakes, 32 tertiary flakes, three angular debris), as well as stone tools (one core tool, two unhafted
bifaces tools, and one hafted biface [Matamoros projectile point]) (see Photographs B-92 and B93). The Matamoros projectile point has a fairly broad temporal association, dating the site from
the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods. Given the artifact assemblage, the site probably
represents a short-term open campsite where limited resource processing was taking place.
While there is limited evidence of subsurface deposits, the site does contain stone tools, one of
which is diagnostic. As a result, the site may have the potential to address research questions
regarding prehistoric settlement and resource processing in south Texas. The archaeological
investigations were largely limited to the survey corridor and the site boundary is considered
incomplete, with additional portions of the site extending outside the current survey boundaries
to the north and east. As a result, additional archaeological investigations would be needed to
determine the eligibility of the site for the NRHP.

41SR429 (3CarGarage-A-2)
Site 41SR429 was originally recorded from a surface scatter of artifacts. Six STPs (D-1 to D-6)
were excavated during the delineation of the site, but none of the test pits excavated was positive
for cultural material (Table 6-19; see Figure A-63). Soil stratigraphy in the STPs consisted of a
single stratum of a pale brown (10YR 6/3) silty clay to a depth of 50 centimeters below ground
surface. Given the lack of any subsurface deposits and the overall good surface visibility (95 to
100 percent), the boundaries of the site were determined from the surface expression of artifacts
and are considered complete. The site measures 108 meters east-west by 32 meters north-south
and has a total site area of 1,791 square meters (see Photograph B-94).

Notes

The site occupies an eastward sloping upland flat that drops into a slight drainage that forms into
a tributary of Arroyo la Minita to the north. Vegetation at the site was minimal and consisted of
a predominantly honey mesquite overstory and buffelgrass understory. Disturbance noted at the
site includes an unimproved road, which cuts through the center of the site, and off-road vehicle
traffic, which seems to have displaced surface artifacts. Erosion has also impacted the site,
particularly in the eastern portion where it drops into a small north-south drainage.
Artifacts recorded at the site were limited to surface material and consisted of predominantly
lithic debitage (eight primary flakes, 13 secondary flakes, 21 tertiary flakes, and one angular
debris) and a limited number of non-diagnostic stone tools (one core tool, one biface fragment
[distal]). Given the site's limited artifact assemblage, the site probably represents a singleoccupation, limited-use, open campsite. Given the light density of artifacts, limited artifact
assemblage, and noted disturbance which adversely impacts the integrity of the site, the site has
little or no potential to provide additional information about prehistoric settlement and adaptation
in south Texas.
41SR430 (3CarGarage-A-4)
The site was originally recorded from a surface scatter of lithic debitage recorded near transect
STP (T2-STP5). An additional five delineation STPs (D-1 to D-5) were excavated at the site, of
which one (D-1) was positive for cultural material to a depth of 20 centimeters below ground
surface (Table 6-20; see Figure A-64). The soil profile from the positive STP consisted of a
yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) clay loam to a depth of 30 centimeters below the ground surface
where the soils became too compact to excavate further. Surface visibility was 80 percent.
Given the limited subsurface deposits and the good surface visibility, the site boundary was

The site is positioned on a relatively broad, upland flat that gently slopes north to a drainage that
forms a tributary of Arroyo la Minita (see Photograph B-95). Vegetation at the site is dominated
by an overstory of honey mesquite and an understory of buffelgrass. Disturbance noted at the
site includes an unimproved road, which cuts through the center of the site, and a utility corridor
(Powerline), which cuts through another portion of the site. Approximately 20 percent of the site
is considered intact.
Artifacts recovered from the site were limited to lithic debitage (one primary, two secondary, and
five tertiary flakes) of chert. Given the limited artifact assemblage, the site probably represents a
short-term, single-use tool modification site. Given the limited artifact assemblage and the lack
of integrity of the majority of the deposits from the construction of an unimproved road and
power line through the site, the site is considered to have little or no potential to answer
questions about prehistoric adaptation and settlement in south Texas and is not recommended
eligible for listing in the NRHP.
41SR431 (3CarGarage-A-5)
The site was originally recorded from a surface scatter of lithic debitage. An additional six
delineation STPs (D-1 to D-6) were excavated at the site, none of which were positive for
cultural material (Table 6-21; see Figure A-65). The soil profile from one of the excavated STPs
consisted of two strata. Stratum I consisted of a light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silt loam to a
depth of 30 cmbgs. Stratum II consisted of a very pale brown (10YR 7/4) weakly cemented
caliche. Surface visibility was 80 percent. Given the lack of subsurface deposits and the good
surface visibility, the site boundary was determined from the surface expression of artifacts. The
site boundaries are considered complete and measure 39 meters east to west by 13 meters north
to south and the site has a total site area of 310 square meters.

6.1.8.2 Historic Resource Investigations
Two aboveground/architectural historic resources, identified by GSRC personnel, were recorded
within the visual APE for the proposed RGC NW of Horse Corrals Fronton Primary tower site.
Old Fronton Cemetery (Cemetery ID No. SR-C046) (see Photograph B-105) is located
approximately 0.74 km (0.46 mile) northwest from the center of the tower site. It is
approximately 0.37 acres and is surrounded by a 5-foot-tall chain-link fence. Two chain-link
gates sit on the east (primary) side of the cemetery. Facing southeast, the tower site is not likely
to be visible from the east side of the cemetery due to tree coverage. As a result, no adverse
effects on architectural or aboveground resources are anticipated. New Fronton Cemetery
(Cemetery ID No. SR-C101) (see Photograph B-106) is located approximately 0.59 km (0.36
mile) northwest from the center of the tower site. It is approximately 0.94 acres and is
surrounded by a 5-foot-tall chain-link fence on the north, south, and east sides. On the west
(primary) side is a fence constructed with red brick pillars and metal poles. Facing southeast, the
tower site is likely to be visible from the west (primary) and east (rear) sides of the cemetery but
does not constitute an adverse visual element. As a result, no adverse effects on architectural or
aboveground resources are anticipated. Additional structures present within the APE consist of
small residential, utility, and commercial structures.
6.1.9 RGC Northwest of Horse Corrals Fronton Alternate
6.1.9.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and six STPs (T2STP1 to T2-STP6) were excavated along the access and utility corridor during the survey of the
RGC Northwest of Horse Corrals Fronton Alternate Tower Site (Table 6-25; see Figure A-69;
see Photographs B-107 to B-114). One of the STPs was positive for cultural material and one
surface scatter was identified during the survey, which resulted in the recording of one
archaeological site (HorseCorral-A-2).

41SR440 (HorseCorral-A-2)
Site 41SR440 was originally recorded from a surface scatter of artifacts noted during the survey
of the tower site, as well as subsurface material recorded within a transect STP (T1-STP2). An
additional two delineation STPs were excavated (D-1 and D-2), of which one was positive for
cultural material (D-2) (Table 6-26; see Figure A-70). The soil profile from the positive
delineation shovel test consists of a pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay to a depth of 40 centimeters
below ground surface. The site is located in a recently plowed field that was fallow at the time
of the survey. As a result, no vegetation was present within the site boundary and surface
visibility was excellent (95 to 100 percent) across the site area. The site, as currently defined,
measures 38 meters north to south by 18 meters east to west and has a total site area of 538
square meters.

found to a depth of 20 centimeters below ground surface in two excavated STPs that were
positive for cultural material. The historic material (glass) was mixed with prehistoric material

to a depth of 20 centimeters below ground surface. Heavy clays and compacted soils limited the
excavation depth of shovel tests to 40 centimeters below ground surface. Given the mixture of
historic and prehistoric material to a depth of 20 centimeters below ground surface, plowing
seems to have disturbed the majority of the site and only an estimated 5 to 10 percent of the site
remains intact. No stone tools, diagnostic cultural material, or cultural features were recorded
during the delineation of the site. The limited artifact assemblage suggests that the site represents
a short-term, single-use open campsite.
Given the very limited artifact assemblage and the evidence of disturbance noted in the shovel
tests, the site is considered to have poor integrity and has little or no potential to address research
questions regarding prehistoric or historic adaptation in south Texas.
6.1.9.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource, identified by GSRC personnel, was recorded
within the visual APE for the proposed RGC Northwest of Horse Corrals Primary tower site.
New Fronton Cemetery (Cemetery ID No. SR-C101) (see Photograph 106) is located
approximately 0.68 km (0.42 mile) southwest from the center of the tower site. It is
approximately 0.94 acres and is surrounded by a 5-foot-tall chain-link fence on the north, south,
and east sides. On the west (primary) side is a fence constructed with red brick pillars and metal
poles. Facing southeast, the tower site is likely to be visible from the west (primary) and east
(rear) sides of the cemetery but does not constitute an adverse visual element. As a result, no
adverse effects on architectural or aboveground resources are anticipated. Additional structures
present within the visual APE consist of small residential, utility, and commercial structures.
6.1.10 RGC Papa Hill Primary
6.1.10.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and 17 STPs (T3STP1 to T3-STP17) were excavated along the access and utility corridor during the survey of the
RGC Northwest of Horse Corrals Fronton Alternate Tower Site (Table 6-27; see Figure A-71;
see Photographs B-115 to B-122). One of the STPs (T3-STP1) was positive for cultural material
and one surface scatter was identified during the survey, which resulted in the updating of one
previously recorded archaeological site (41SR403).

41SR403
Site 41SR403 was originally identified during a plant survey that was conduct by the USFWS in
2015. The previously conducted work at site 41SR403 has been described in section 5.1.10.2.
During the current survey of the southern portion of the access and utility corridor GSRC
personnel recorded an extension of 41SR403, which was identified from one positive transect
STP (T3-STP1) and an extensive surface scatter of artifacts (see Figure A-72). The site extends
from the eastern 2015 boundary approximately 490 meters south and southeast along the current
access and utility corridor and extending across the northern portion of the tower footprint. The
recording of the extension of 41SR403 was largely limited to the current survey area and the site
encompasses the entire survey corridor and the northern portion of the tower pad. A surface
reconnaissance beyond the survey area noted artifacts extending to the east, west, and north of
the current survey area and the site boundaries of the extension of 41SR403 are not considered
complete. An additional four (T3-STP2 to T3STP5) transect STPs were excavated across along
the access and utility corridor within the surface scatter of artifacts, but none of them were
positive for cultural material (see Table 6-27). In addition, none of the STPs excavated at the
tower site were positive for cultural material.
The site is positioned on a relatively high ridge that drops into a large tributary of the Rio Grande
to the west, and several smaller drainages to the east. Vegetation at the site was typical of south

Texas shrublands and consisted of predominantly honey mesquite overstory and buffelgrass
understory. Other vegetation noted near the site includes huisachillo (Acacia schaffneri),
limberbush (Jatropha cardiophylla), bee brush (Aloysia gratissima), five-needle dogweed
(Thymophylla pentachaeta), coyotillo (Karwinskia humboldtiana), guayacan (Guaiacum
angustifolium), huisache (Acacia farnesiana), and Texas ranger (Leucophyllum frutescens) (see
Photograph B-123). The soil profile from the single positive STP excavated within the site
boundary consists of a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay to a depth of 50 cmbgs.
Artifacts were recorded predominantly from the surface with a single secondary flake of chert,
which was recovered from a depth of 25 cmbgs. The artifact inventory from the site was
dominated by lithic debitage (84 primary flakes, 121 secondary flakes, 162 tertiary flakes, and 73
pieces of angular debris). A limited number of stone tools were also recorded at the site and
included five core tools and four bifaces (see Photographs B-124 to B-133). Finally a small
amount of faunal material (11 shell) was also recorded within the site boundary. All of the lithic
material recorded was composed of chert. Chert colors included white, brown, and gray. Given
the artifact inventory recorded within the extension of the site, GSRC personnel concur with the
interpretation of the site in 2015 that it primarily represents a quarry and lithic procurement site.
The larger proportion of latter stage reduction debitage, as well as the presence of several biface
tools, tool production and resource processing may have also been conducted at the site. The
presence of unworked shell at the site may also suggest that subsistence processing may have
also taken place at the site.
Only a limited portion of the overall site was investigated during the current survey, as work was
limited to the survey boundaries of the access and utility corridor and tower footprint. Limited
reconnaissance outside of the current survey boundary noted that surface artifacts extended
toward the north, west, and east of the current survey area and the site boundaries are
incomplete. The site may have the potential to address multiple research questions regarding
resource procurement, tool manufacturing and possibly subsistence within south Texas.
Additional archaeological investigations would be required to assess the potential of site
41SR403 for inclusion in the NRHP. As a result, GSRC recommends that the site have an
undetermined eligibility for the NRHP until additional archaeological investigations can be
conducted, including more extensive mapping of the site boundaries and surface expression of
artifacts and possibly additional subsurface testing to determine if intact subsurface deposits exist
outside of the current survey corridor.
6.1.10.2 Historic Resource Investigations
No previously recorded aboveground/architectural resources that are listed in the NRHP or
eligible for listing in the NRHP are located within the visual APE of the proposed RGC Papa
Hill Primary tower site and along its access and utility corridor. There are no visible structures
present in the APE.

survey (Table 6-28; see Figure A-73). This resulted in the recording of one new archaeological
site (41SR439), the updating of one previously recorded archaeological site (41SR395), and the
recording of three IOs (IO-PapaHill-3-1, IO-PapaHill-3-2, and IO-PapaHill-3-3).

41SR392
The site was previously recorded by e2M in 2007 during their survey of areas for the proposed
U.S. border fence and associated construction staging area. In 2007 they recorded 50 surface
artifacts and 99 subsurface artifacts. In shovel tests excavated at the site, they noted cultural
material to a depth of 1.4 meters below ground surface. The e2M recorder recommended that the
site be eligible for the NRHP and that it should be avoided or mitigated prior to construction of
the border fence. In 2007 the site was utilized as an observation point for CBP.
When GSRC revisited the site, CBP had erected a temporary remote video surveillance tower
within its boundaries. A built-up gravel platform was constructed for the placement of the
temporary remote video surveillance tower, with concrete anchors on the surface to secure and
stabilize the temporary tower. As a result, the establishment of the temporary remote video
surveillance tower resulted in little or no ground disturbance within the previously recorded site.
The current investigation utilized limited shovel test excavations (three STPs [T1-STP1 to T1STP3]) and surface inspection to relocate the site and verify that presence of the previously
recorded subsurface artifacts. Two of the three STPs excavated (T1-STP1 and T1-STP3) were
positive for cultural material to depths of 50 centimeters below ground surface (see Table 6-28;
see Figure A-74). Additional surface artifacts were noted and conformed in distribution to the
previously established site boundaries. No stone tools or diagnostic artifacts were noted during
the site revisit. Given the results of the site revisit, the condition of the site has largely remained
the same and GSRC concurs with the previous recommendations for the site.
41SR439 (PapaHill-3-1-1)
The site was originally recorded from a surface scatter of artifacts and a single positive transect
STP (T2-STP8). An additional five delineation STPs (D-1 to D-5) were excavated, but none
were positive for cultural material (Table 6-29; see Figure A- 75). As a result, the site boundary
was largely determined from the surface expression of artifacts. Site delineation was generally
kept within the limits of the survey corridor, though a surface reconnaissance noted artifacts
extending beyond the limits of the survey. As a result, the site boundary to the west is not
considered complete. The site boundaries to the north, south, and east are complete. The site, as
currently delineated, measures 56 meters north to south by 48 meters east to west and has a total
site area of 1,851 square meters. The site is positioned on a gently sloping upland terrace that
overlooks an abandoned tributary of Los Negros Creek. Vegetation at the site was dominated by
an overstory of honey mesquite and Texas ebony and an understory of predominantly buffelgrass
(see Photograph B-142).

Artifacts were recovered predominantly from the surface, though cultural material was recovered
to a depth of 20 centimeters below ground surface in the initial positive transect shovel test. The
soil profile of that positive shovel test consisted of a light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) silty loam
to a depth of 35 centimeters below ground surface, before encountering a weakly cemented
limestone bedrock. Artifacts recorded at the site were dominated by chert lithic debitage in
predominantly later stage reduction (10 primary flakes, 26 secondary flakes, 45 tertiary flakes,
and six pieces of angular debris). One stone tool was recorded from the surface, which was a
multidirectional core tool (see Photographs B-143 and B-144). A minimal amount (two
fragments) of thermally altered rock fragments were also recorded from the surface, which may
indicate the presence of unidentified thermal features at the site. Given the artifact assemblage,
the site probably represents a short-term, open campsite of unknown prehistoric cultural
affiliation. While the artifact assemblage lacks substantial stone tools and diagnostic artifacts,
the minimal presence of thermally altered rock at the site may indicate that unrecorded thermal
features may be present at the site. Given that a large portion of the site lies outside the current
survey corridor to the west and is unrecorded, the eligibility of the site for the NRHP cannot be
determined without additional archaeological investigations.
IO-PapaHill-3-1 (PapaHill-3-1)
IO-PapaHill-3-1 consists of a single concrete feature with no associated artifacts. The feature
consisted of a possible rectangular concrete watering trough for cattle (see Photograph B-145).
The trough was oriented southeast to northwest and measured 237 cm in length by 131 cm in
width. The walls of the trough were 20 cm thick. The exterior height of the feature walls were
65 cm while the interior height of the walls were approximately 50 cm in height. Given that the
locus consisted of an isolated feature with no associated artifact scatter it is considered to be an
IO. IO-PapaHill-3-1 is not considered eligible for listing in the NRHP and no further
archaeological work is recommended for the IO.
IO-PapaHill-3-2 (PapaHill-3-2)
IO-PapaHill-3-2 was originally recorded from a single positive transect STP (T2-STP11), which
recovered a single secondary flake from 20 to 30 cmbgs. An additional five delineation STPs
(D-1 to D-5) were excavated at the locus, but none of the STPs were positive for cultural
material (Table 6-30; see Figure A-77). Given that only a single artifact was recovered from the
locus it is considered to be an IO (see Photograph B-146). IO-PapaHill-3-2 is not considered to
be eligible for listing in the NRHP and no additional archaeological investigations are
recommended for the IO.

recovered a single secondary flake of bluish gray chert from 10 to 20 cmbgs. An additional five
delineation STPs (D-1 to D-5) were excavated during the delineation of the locus, none of which
were positive for cultural material (Table 6-31; see Figure A-78). Given that only a single
artifact was recovered from the locus, it is considered to be an IO (see Photograph B-147). IOPapaHill-3-3 is not considered to be eligible for listing in the NRHP and no additional
archaeological investigations are recommended for the IO.

6.1.11.2 Historic Resource Investigations
No previously recorded aboveground/architectural resources that are listed in the NRHP or
eligible for listing in the NRHP are located within the visual APE of the proposed RGC Papa
Hill Tertiary Option 1 tower site and its access and utility corridor. There are no visible
structures present in the APE.
6.1.12 RGC Relay Tower
6.1.12.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
On the eastern portion of the access and utility corridor the existing unimproved access road is
immediately bounded to the south by a barbed wire fence and property boundary and to the north
by a wide pipeline corridor. As a result, the excavation of STPs was not possible along an 880meter portion along the access utility corridor from the tower footprint west. Three STPs (T1STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and 22 STPs (T2-STP1 to T2STP22) were excavated along the remaining portion of the access and utility corridor during the
survey of the RGC Relay Tower and its associated access and utility corridor (see Photographs
B-148 to B-155; see Figure A-79). One of the STPs was positive for cultural material (T2STP14) and three surface scatters of artifacts were identified during the surveys (Table 6-32).
This resulted in the recording of three new archaeological sites (41SR425, 41SR426, and
41SR427).

41SR425 (RelayTower-1)
Site 41SR425 was originally recorded from a surface find of a chert secondary flake found near a
transect STP (T1-STP3). No subsurface cultural material was noted in any of the transect STPs
excavated and surface visibility across the site was excellent (90 to 95 percent). In addition, the
depositional environment and soil type present at the site suggests that there is little or no
potential for subsurface deposits at the site. Given the factors above, the delineation of the
boundaries of the site was determined from the surface expression of artifacts alone and no
additional delineation STPs were excavated (see Figure A-80). The site is positioned on the
gentle northern and western slopes of an upland hill (see Photograph B-156). The site measures
49 meters north to south by 35 meters east to west and has a total site area of 929 square meters.
Vegetation at the site was sparse and dominated by a honey mesquite overstory and buffelgrass
understory. Soils at the site were shallow and consistent with the typical pedon of the JimenezQuemado Association soil type. The soil profile from transect STP 1-3 was composed of two
strata. Stratum I consisted of a yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) loam with heavy gravel and cobbles
(60 percent) to a depth of 25 centimeters below ground surface, followed by Stratum II, a weakly

cemented caliche from 25 to 35 centimeters below ground surface. The limits of the site could
be determined in all directions and the site boundary is considered complete.
The artifact assemblage at the site was extremely light and consisted of lithic debitage (one
primary flake and three secondary flakes), as well as stone tools (three multidirectional core
tools) of chert (see Photographs B-157 to B-160). The artifact assemblage suggests that the site
represents a very limited-use, lithic procurement area of unknown cultural affiliation. Given the
lack of subsurface deposits, lack of diagnostic artifacts and features, and low artifact density, the
site is considered to have little or no potential to address research questions regarding prehistoric
settlement, tool production, or lithic procurement in south Texas.
41SR426 (RelayTower-2)
Site 41SR426 was originally recorded from a positive transect STP (T2-STP14), which
recovered material between 20 and 30 centimeters below ground surface. An additional four
delineation STPs (D-1 to D-4) were excavated, none of which were positive for cultural material
(Table 6-33; see Figure A-81). An extensive surface scatter of material was also noted across the
site area, increasing in density towards the north and west, outside of the current survey corridor.
As a result, the site boundary was determined through a combination of surface expression of
artifacts and excavation of delineation and transect STPs. The site boundary is complete on the
eastern, western, and southern edges. A surface reconnaissance conducted outside of the current
survey corridor to the north noted a large amount of cultural material extending in that direction.
As a result, the site boundary in that direction is not considered complete. As currently
delineated, the site measures 136 meters northwest to southeast along an unnamed dirt road by
79 meters southwest to northeast and has a total site area of 5,184 square meters.

STP excavated at site 41SR426 consisted of a single stratum of very pale brown (10YR 7/4)
loam to a depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface.
Artifacts recorded at the site were predominantly from the surface. Artifacts recorded were
overwhelmingly dominated by lithic debitage (10 primary flakes, 27 secondary flakes, 65 tertiary
flakes, and four pieces of angular debris) of chert. Only a single stone tool was recorded at the
site, which consisted of a distal biface fragment of chert (see Photographs B-162 and B-163).
The remaining assemblage consisted of a single specimen of thermally altered rock. Subsurface
artifacts were only recovered from a single transect STP and consisted of one secondary flake
and one tertiary flake recovered from 20 to 30 centimeters below ground surface. Given the
artifact assemblage, the site probably represents a limited, short-term prehistoric open campsite
of unknown cultural affiliation. While the site has a fairly limited artifact assemblage within the
current survey corridor, a large portion of the site extends northward and additional
archaeological investigations would be needed to determine the site's eligibility for the NRHP.
41SR427 (RelayTower-3)
Site 41SR427 was originally located from surface artifacts noted within the road, near transect
STP (T2-STP20). An additional five delineation STPs (D-1 to D-5) were excavated outside of
the surface scatter of artifacts to determine the boundaries of the site (Table 6-34). None of the
delineation STPs was positive for cultural material. The single transect STP (T2-STP20) that
was excavated within the site boundary was also negative for cultural material. A surface
reconnaissance outside of the survey corridor noted only a limited number of artifacts extending
beyond the survey corridor that were mapped and the site boundaries are considered complete
(see Figure A-82). The site, as delineated, measures 117 meters east to west by 39 meters north
to south, and has a total site area of 2,352 square meters.

light overstory of honey mesquite and understory of buffelgrass. The single negative transect
STP excavated within the site boundary recorded a single stratum consisting of a light yellowish
brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam to a depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface.

All the artifacts recorded from the site came from the surface. The artifact assemblage was
dominated by later reduction lithic debitage (three primary flakes, 11 secondary flakes, 18
tertiary flakes, and one angular debris) of chert. Stone tools recorded at the site were limited to
one multidirectional core tool of chert and one small unimarginal flake tool of chert (see
Photographs B-165 to B-168). Given the limited artifact assemblage, the site probably
represents a single-use, short-term open campsite of unknown cultural affiliation. Given the
limited and light artifact assemblage, lack of diagnostic artifacts and features, and lack of
evidence for subsurface deposits, the site is considered to have a poor potential to provide
information on prehistoric adaptations in south Texas.

The boundary of Roma NRHP-listed historic district (Reference No. 72001371) is located within
the visual APE of the proposed RGC Igloo House Primary tower site. The boundaries of the
historic district include 11 major architecturally significant structures by Enrique Portscheller, as
well as stone and adobe buildings typical of the Rio Grande Valley. Also included in the visual
APE are nine OTHM. The Roma City Hall marker (Marker No. 4341), the Noah Cox House
marker (Marker No. 6055), the Old Garcia Home marker (Marker No. 3734), the Our Lady of
Refuge Catholic Church marker (Marker No. 3885), the Old Roma Convent Building marker
(Marker No. 4342), and the Knights of Columbus Hall marker (Marker No. 6058) are all
medallion markers. The Early Commercial Center marker (Marker No. 6062) outlines the
history of the indigenous Mexican-style building. The Manuel Guerra Store marker (Marker No.
3200) details the construction of the classic-revival structure. The Memorial Hospital marker

(Marker No. 3324) details the construction of the building and its function. These three OTHMs
are medallions with plaques.
The proposed RGC Igloo House Primary tower site is visible from all historic resources present
in the APE and, while it does constitute an adverse visual element, the resources present would
not be directly impacted because the use of adjacent properties has changed dramatically. In
addition, adverse visual elements are already present within the visual APE. As a result, no
adverse effects on architectural or aboveground resources that are eligible for the NRHP are
anticipated. Other structures present within the visual APE are a combination of large and small
commercial and residential buildings.

Memorial Park (Cemetery ID No. SR-C084) is located approximately0.67 km (0.41 mile)
northwest from the center of the tower site. No established date is known. It is approximately
16.5 acres and is surrounded by a metal fence with red brick post supports on all sides of the
cemetery. A metal gate hangs from the center of the north (primary) side. Facing southwest, the
tower site is not likely to be visible from the north (primary) side because of tree coverage;

Three STPs (T1-STP1 toT1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and six STPs (T2STP1 to T2-STP6) were excavated along the access and utility corridor during the survey of the
RGC North of Dairy Pump Primary tower site and its associated access and utility corridor (see
Photographs B-204 to B-211). None of the STPs were positive for cultural material and no
archaeological sites or IOs were recorded during the survey of the proposed tower site or its
associated access and utility corridor (Table 6-39; see Figure A-87).
6.1.17.2 Historic Resource Investigations
Two aboveground/architectural historic resources were recorded within the visual APE of the
proposed RGC North of Dairy Pump Primary tower site. Los Garzas Cemetery (Cemetery ID
No. SR-C045) (see Photograph B-212) is located approximately 0.37 km (0.23 mile) southeast
from the center of the tower site. No established date is known for the cemetery. It is
approximately 0.21 acres and is not surrounded by a fence of any kind. Facing northwest, the
tower site is likely to be visible from the west (primary) side of the cemetery, but it will not
constitute as an adverse visual element. The Unknown Grave (Cemetery ID No. SR-C044) (see
Photograph B-213) is located 0.61 km (0.38 mile) east of the center of the tower site. No
established date is known for the cemetery. It is approximately 0.3 acre and is surrounded by
vegetation. At the center of the plot of land is a single gravestone that reads “N. Los Garzas.”
Facing west, the tower site is unlikely to be visible from the west (primary) side of the cemetery
due to tree coverage. As a result, no adverse effects on aboveground historic resources are
anticipated. Other existing structures present within the visual APE include both residential and
commercial structures.

6.1.18.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 toT1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and nine STPs
(T2-STP1 to T2-STP9) were excavated along the access and utility corridor during the survey of
the RGC North of Dairy Pump Alternate tower site and its associated access and utility corridor
(see Photographs B-214 to B-221). Two of the STPs were positive for cultural material (T2STP1 and T2-STP2) and two surface scatters of artifacts were identified during the surveys
(Table 6-40; see Figure A-88). This resulted in the recording of two new archaeological sites
(41SR442 and 41SR441).

41SR442 (DairyPump-A-2)
Site 41SR442 was originally recorded from a surface find near transect STP T2-STP6. An
additional five STPs (D-1 to D-5) were excavated during the delineation of the site, none of
which were positive for cultural material (Table 6-41). Surface visibility at the site was
excellent, with 95 to 100 percent surface visibility across the site. Given the lack of any
evidence of subsurface deposits and the overall excellent surface visibility, the boundaries of the
site were determined from the surface expression of artifacts alone. No additional cultural
material was noted extending beyond the survey corridor. As a result, the site boundary is
considered complete. The site measures 37 meters northwest to southeast by 12 meters northeast
to southwest, and has a total surface area of 325 square meters (see Figure A-89).

The site is situated on an escarpment that overlooks the Rio Grande floodplain to the south. The
area around the site has seen heavy modification for gravel or caliche extraction. Vegetation
across the site was sparse, and consisted of an overstory dominated by honey mesquite and an
understory dominated by buffelgrass (see Photograph B-222). The soil profile from the transect
STP located near the center of the site consisted of a single stratum of brown (10YR 5/3) sandy
loam to a depth of 76 centimeters below ground surface.
The artifact assemblage recorded at the site was sparse and consisted of lithic debitage (two
tertiary flakes and one angular debris) and stone tools (two unimarginal flake tools) (see
Photographs B-223 to B-226). All cultural material was recorded from the surface and no
subsurface cultural material was noted in any of the STPs excavated at the site. The limited
artifact assemblage suggests that the site represents a short-term, single-occupation, open
campsite. Given the limited artifact assemblage, as well as the questionable integrity, the site is
considered to have little or no potential to provide significant information on prehistoric
settlement, resource processing, or adaptation in south Texas.
41SR441 (DairyPump-A-1)
Site 41SR441 was originally recorded from two positive transect STPs (2-1 and 2-2). An
additional four delineation STPs (D-1 to D-4) were excavated during the site delineation, of
which three were positive for cultural material (Table 6-42). In addition to subsurface cultural
material, surface artifacts were noted within the site boundaries, with the heaviest concentration
in the southern portion of the site found within an artifact concertation mapped as AC-2 (see
Figure A-90). Site delineation was limited to the east by a property fence line and to the west by
the survey corridor boundary. This limited the excavation of STPs along that portion of the site
to a single line paralleling the road. Surface visibility at the site was poor (5 percent), with the
exception of the unimproved dirt road running through the eastern portion of the site, which
provided good surface visibility. Given the limitation of the survey corridor, the site boundary is
not considered complete and may extend further to the east or west. As currently defined, the site
measures 191 meters northeast to southwest by 17 meters northwest to southeast and has a total
site area of 3,064 square meters.

The site is positioned on a relatively flat and broad upland ridge that drops into the Arroyo
Quiote drainage to the west. Vegetation at the site had a limited overstory of honey mesquite,
which was concentrated along the property line on the eastern boundary of the site. The
understory was a thick ground cover of buffelgrass, creating poor surface visibility across the
majority of the site (see Photograph B-227). A profile from a positive STP excavated at the site
consisted of two strata. Stratum I consisted of a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sandy loam which
extended to a depth of 70 centimeters below ground surface, followed by Stratum II, which
consisted of a light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) compact and loosely cemented caliche.
Artifacts recorded at the site included both surface and subsurface cultural material. Subsurface
cultural material was recorded to a depth of 80 centimeters below ground surface. Artifacts
recorded included lithic debitage (four primary flakes, nine secondary flakes, 22 tertiary flakes,
and four pieces of angular debris) of chert, chalcedony, and quartzite and multiple chert stone
tools (two unimarginal flake tools, three core tools, two biface fragments) (see Photographs B228 to B-245). In addition to the flaked stone, fragments of thermally altered rock were recorded
in the STPs excavated in the northern portion of the site, which suggests that unidentified
thermal features may be present at the site. Given the artifact assemblage, the site probably
represents a single-occupation, open campsite. The presence of multiple stone tools and
thermally altered rocks suggests that resource processing was taking place at the site. Given the
artifact assemblage and presence of intact subsurface deposits, the site has the potential to
provide significant information about prehistoric settlement, resource processing including
subsistence data, and prehistoric adaptation in south Texas. Given that the investigation was
limited to the 60-foot survey corridor and only examined a portion of the site, additional
archaeological investigations would be needed to evaluate the site for inclusion in the NRHP.

6.1.22.2 Historic Resource Investigations
No aboveground/architectural historic resources were identified within the visual APE of the
proposed RGC Tower near Silos RGC Primary tower site. The boundary of Fort Ringgold
Historic District NRHP-listed historic district (Reference No. 93000196) intersects with the
visual APE of the proposed tower site. It is estimated that the proposed tower site will have
minimal visual impact on Fort Ringgold Historic District NRHP-listed historic district, as there
are no contributing elements of the historic district that would be directly impacted. The closest
historic site is 0.83 km (0.51 mile) away. As a result, no adverse effects on architectural or
aboveground historic resources that are eligible for the NRHP are anticipated. Other existing
structures present within the visual APE of the tower site are a combination of large and small
commercial and residential buildings.
6.1.23 RGC Tower Near Silos Alternate
6.1.23.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
One STP (T3-STP1) was excavated along the access and utility corridor for the proposed RGC
Tower Near Silos Alternate tower site. The area encompassing the tower footprint itself was
heavily disturbed with extant concrete structures present across the tower site (see Photographs
B-274 to B-281). The heavy disturbance and built environment prevented the excavation of
STPs within the footprint of the proposed RGC Tower Near Silos Alternate tower site. No
archaeological resources were recorded within the STP excavated or during the pedestrian survey
of the proposed tower site and associated access road (Table 6-48).

6.1.23.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One OTHM, identified by GSRC personnel, is recorded within the visual APE of the proposed
RGC Tower near Silos RGC Alternate tower site. The OTHM is the Lee House marker (Marker
No. 6059). The marker is a medallion. The proposed RGC Tower near Silos RGC Alternate
tower site is visible from this historic site and, while it does constitute as an adverse visual
element, the resource would not be directly impacted because the use of adjacent properties has
changed dramatically, as well as already present adverse visual elements within the visual APE.
As a result, no adverse effects on architectural or aboveground resources that are eligible for the
NRHP are anticipated. The boundary of Fort Ringgold Historic District NRHP-listed historic
district (Reference No. 93000196) intersects with the visual APE of the RGC Tower near Silos

6.1.24 RGC Los Velas Tertiary Option 1
6.1.24.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and seven STPs
(T2-STP1 to T2-STP7) were excavated along the access corridor during the survey of the RGC
Los Velas Tertiary Option 1 tower site (see Photographs B-282 to B-289). A 1,520-meter
portion of the access corridor has buried gas pipelines paralleling both side of the existing
roadway which encompassed the entire access corridor. This portion was excluded from
subsurface testing and the survey was limited to a pedestrian surface inspection. None of the
STPs were positive for archaeological material and no archaeological resources were recorded
during the survey of the RGC Los Velas Tertiary Option 1 tower site and its associated access
corridor (Table 6-49).

6.1.24.2 Historic Resource Investigations
No previously recorded aboveground/architectural historic resources that are listed in the NRHP
or eligible for listing in the NRHP are located within the visual APE of the proposed RGC Los
Velas Tertiary Option 1 tower site. The existing structures present within the visual APE are
utility facilities.
The Los Velas Soldier’s cemetery (Cemetery No. SR-C074) is not located within the visual APE
of the tower but is located on the western side of the access road (Los Velas Road),
approximately 1.45 km (0.9 mile) northwest from the center of the proposed tower site. The
cemetery is approximately 0.03 acre and is surrounded by a 3-foot chain-link fence on all four
sides. No additional information is known about the cemetery. The access road is not likely to
disturb the cemetery in any way, as it is located on private property.
6.1.25 RGC Los Velas Tertiary Option 2
6.1.25.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and 21 STPs (T2STP1 to T2-STP21) were excavated along the access and utility corridor during the survey of the
RGC Los Velas Tertiary Option 2 tower site and its associated access and utility corridor (see
Photographs B-290 to B-297). Surface visibility along the access and utility corridor was
excellent, 90 to 99 percent, with agricultural fields that were plowed and had experienced rain.
None of the STPs were positive for archaeological material and no archaeological resources were
recorded during the survey of the RGC Los Velas Tertiary Option 2 tower site and its associated
access and utility corridor (Table 6-50; see Figure A-98).

41SR443 (LaCasita-P-1)
The site was originally located from a surface scatter of historic material on the east side of
South Casita Farm Road. The site is positioned on a terrace overlooking the Rio Grande
floodplain. Vegetation noted at the site includes honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa),
bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris), tree tobacco (Nicotiana
glauca), Russian thistle (Salsola tragus), Palmer's amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri), and
silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium). Surface visibility at the site varied between 5
and 90 percent across the site (see Photograph B-322).
Given the potential for subsurface deposits and the poor ground visibility over some portions of
the site area, subsurface testing through the excavation of STPs was also conducted at the site.
An additional six STPs (D-1 to D-6) were excavated at the site, of which three were positive for
cultural material (Table 6-53). The soil profiles from the positive shovel tests were not typical of
the McAllen Sandy Loam soil type and may represent fill material brought in. A typical soil

profile from a positive STP consisted of a pale brown (10YR 6/3) clay loam to a depth of 50
centimeters below ground surface. Site delineation was limited by the survey corridor to the
east, which only allowed a single line of STPs to be excavated parallel to the road. As a result,
the site boundary to the east is not considered complete. The site, as currently delineated,
measures 71 meters southwest to northeast by 10 meters northwest to southeast and has a total
site area of 660 square meters (see Figure A-101).

Artifacts recorded from the surface and within STPs consisted of ceramics, including decorated
and undecorated whiteware, decorated and undecorated porcelain, undecorated stoneware, and
annular yellowware. Glass artifacts recorded included curved and bottle glass shards in various
colors including clear, amber, green, yellow, black (dark olive), and solarized manganese (see
Photographs B-323 to B-329). One clear glass bottle basal shard had an Illinois Glass Company
maker's mark of an "I" within a diamond (see Photograph B-329). The “I” within a diamond
maker’s mark was used from 1916 to 1929 (Toulouse 2001:264). Metal artifacts recorded
consisted of ferrous metal artifacts including wire nails and fence staples, and non-ferrous metal
fragments including aluminum foil and tin. Other artifacts included brick fragments, a cement
fragment, and a limited number of indeterminate faunal bone fragments. One possible feature
(Feature 1 [F.1]) was recorded at the site, which was a 1- to 3-foot-high earthen embankment
located in the central portion of the site and extending outside of the survey corridor to the east.
Heavy grasses obscured most of its surface, making the exact mapping of the rise difficult. The
rise may be a raised earthen foundation for a structure. The road located to the west of the site
seems to have been widened and may have impacted the western portion of the site.

Archival maps consulted show three structures on the east side of the road in the vicinity of the
site on the 1965 La Grulla, TX 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle. The 1956 Garcias, TX 15minute topographic quadrangle shows one structure in the vicinity of the site and it is marked as
a school. No earlier maps of sufficient scale to see structures were found during the archival
research.
Given the artifact assemblage and limited archival map evidence, the site probably represents
one or more farmsteads that were present in the area with an occupation dating from the late
nineteenth to middle twentieth century. Given the large number of turn-of-the-century farmstead
archaeological sites already investigated within south Texas, site 41SR443 has a relatively poor
potential to provide additional information regarding turn of the century historic settlement and
adaptation in south Texas. The site is not recommended as eligible for inclusion in the NRHP

6.1.28.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
An existing unimproved road and natural gas pipelines encompassed the entire footprint of the
associated 30-foot access roadway and the tower footprint itself was heavily disturbed by oil and
gas development. Overall surface visibility across the tower footprint and access road was good
to excellent, 70 to 90 percent (see Photographs B-330 to B-333). Given the heavy disturbance
and overall good surface visibility, both the tower footprint and access road were subject to an
intensive pedestrian survey and surface inspection. Three STPs were excavated at the tower
footprint, all of which were negative for cultural material (Table 6-54; see Figure A-102). No
archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of the RGC La Casita Main Alternate
tower site and associated access road.

After the original RGC North of Silvertanks Military Primary tower site and associated access
and utility corridor were surveyed, a relocated tower site and associated access road and utility
corridor were provided. As a result, the new relocated RGC North of Silvertanks Military
Primary tower site was subsequently surveyed. Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were
excavated within the tower footprint and one STP (T2-STP1) was excavated along the utility
corridor during the survey of the RGC North of Silvertanks Military Primary (Relocated) tower
site and its associated access and utility corridor (Table 6-57; see Figure A-104). The area
encompassing the tower footprint and associated utility corridor appeared heavily disturbed, with
push-piles of dirt noted in the northern portion of the tower footprint (see Photographs B-341 to

41SR420 (Silvertanks-P-1)
The site was originally recorded from a surface scatter of artifacts noted around a transect STP
(T2-STP6). An additional four transect STPs were excavated across the site, but none were
positive for subsurface cultural material (see Figure A-105). One additional delineation STP was
excavated to the east of transect STP T2-STP6, to further test for subsurface artifacts downslope
of the ridge, but was also negative for subsurface material (Table 6-58). The soil profile of the
delineation STP near the center of the site consisted of single stratum of brown (10YR 5/3) loam
with a heavy cobble and gravel concentration to a depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface.

seems to be the dominant soil type across the site, instead of either Ramadero Loam (Ra) or

Notes
Field Site 2; ~ 15 meters east of STP 2-6; high
concentration of cobble and gravel

The site extends along a ridgetop and eastern slope of a southwest-to-northeast trending ridge. A
barbed wire fence and property line runs along the top of the ridge and forms the western
boundary of the site. To the east the land drops to a southwest-to-northeast abandoned channel
that was a tributary of Salado Creek. The ridge and slope have exposed cobbles and gravel on
the surface. While the area is mapped as being predominantly Ramadero Loam and McAllen
Fine Sandy Loam, actual surface corresponds better with the typical pedon of the JiminezQuemado Association soil type. Vegetation at the site is dominated by an understory of
buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliare) and a scattered overstory of honey mesquites (Prosopis
glandulosa), Texas paloverde (Parkinsonia texanum), huisache (Acacia farnesiana), blackbrush
acacia (Acacia rigidula), spiny hackberry (Celtis pallida), and wild lime (Zanthoxylum fagara)
(see Photograph B-349).
Given the concentration of cobbles and gravel on the surface, the absence of any subsurface
artifacts across the site, and the good to excellent ground surface visibility, the surface
expression of artifacts was utilized to determine the site boundary. The boundary of the site to
the west was set at the barbed wire fence line which is thought to be the property boundary. Site
delineation was largely limited to the survey corridor, which extended 60 feet east from the fence
line. As a result, the site boundary is not considered complete and may extend further to both the
west and east, outside of the current survey area. The site, as currently defined, measures 398
meters northeast to southwest by 28 meters northwest to southeast and has a total site area of
7,505 square meters.
Artifacts recovered consisted of lithic debitage (83 primary flakes, 23 secondary flakes, 15
tertiary flakes, 19 tested cobbles, and four angular debris), flake stone tools (24 cores
multidirectional and unidirectional), and ground stone tools (two possible manos and three
possible metates) (see Photographs B-350 to B-365). All lithic material consisted of chert.
Given the predominance of early stage reduction debitage and the high percentage of cores, the
site probably represents a repeated-use, primary reduction locus or quarry site.
Given the large amount of artifacts recorded at the site, the site has the potential to provide
information on lithic procurement, lithic sourcing, and prehistoric adaptations in the area. The
current survey only recorded the portion of the site within the current survey corridor and
additional archaeological investigations would be needed to assess the site's eligibility for the
NRHP.

41SR421 (Silvertanks-P-2)
Site 41SR421 was originally recorded from a surface scatter of artifacts noted around a transect
STP (T2-STP10). An additional four delineation STPs (D-1 to D-4) were excavated across the
site, with one STP being positive for cultural material to a depth of 30 cmbgs (Table 6-59). The
boundary of the site to the west was set at the barbed wire fence line, which is thought to be the
property boundary. Site delineation was largely limited to the survey corridor, which extended
60 feet east from the fence line. The site boundary is considered complete, as additional material
was not noted outside of the survey corridor. The site measures 23 meters north to south by 16
meters east to west and has a total site area of 283 square meters (see Figure 106).

The soil profile of the positive delineation STP consisted of a single stratum of brown (10YR
4/3) loam with a heavy cobble and gravel concentration to a depth of 20 centimeters below
ground surface. The profiles noted in the STPs excavated across the site and the heavy
concentration of cobbles and gravel on the surface were more typical of the Jimenez-Quemado
association pedon, which seems to be the dominant soil type across the site, instead of Ramadero
Loam (Ra).
The site is located in an abandoned channel of a tributary of Salado Creek, between two ridges
that contain larger lithic procurement/quarry sites. Site delineation was limited to the west by a
barbed wire fence and property line, and to the east by the limits of the survey corridor. While
the site is positioned within an abandoned channel between two higher landforms, the soil type is
consistent with the tops of the landforms and has a heavy cobble and gravel content in the upper
stratum. Vegetation at the site is dominated by an understory of buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliare)
and a scattered overstory of honey mesquites (Prosopis glandulosa), Texas paloverde
(Parkinsonia texanum), huisache (Acacia farnesiana), blackbrush acacia (Acacia rigidula), spiny
hackberry (Celtis pallida), and wild lime (Zanthoxylum fagara) (see Photograph B-366).
Artifacts recovered consist of lithic debitage (eight primary flakes, two secondary flakes, four
tertiary flakes, and one piece of angular debris) and two flaked stone tools (one multidirectional
core tool and one unidirectional core tool) (see Photographs B-367 and B-368). All lithic
material consisted of chert. Given the predominance of early stage reduction debitage and the

larger quarry sites located to the north and south of this site, this site probably also represents a
limited-use, lithic procurement/quarry site.
Given the limited number of artifacts recovered from the site and the lack of diagnostic material
and features, the site is considered to have a low research potential, particularly compared to the
larger lithic procurement sites found to the north and south. The site is recommended not
eligible for the NRHP.
41SR422 (SilverTanks-P-3)
Site 41SR422 was initially identified from surface artifacts noted in the vicinity of several
transect STPs excavated across the site area. None of the nine transect shovel tests pits
excavated across the site were positive for subsurface cultural material. Given the lack of
subsurface cultural material in the initial transect STPs, the depositional environment, soil type,
and good to excellent ground visibility, the site boundary was delineated utilizing surface
expression of artifacts alone. The western boundary of the site was set at the barbed wire fence
line, which is thought to be the property boundary. The site boundary is not considered complete
and may extend to both the west and east beyond the current survey area. As currently defined,
the site measures 569 meters northeast to southwest by 24 meters northwest to southeast and has
a total site area of 12,203 square meters (see Figure 107).
The site extends across several low east-west trending broad finger ridges separated by
intermittent narrow arroyos that drain into an abandoned tributary of Salado Creek. The main
abandoned channel of the tributary is to the west, outside of the current survey area. Vegetation
across the site area is sparse and consists of a limited overstory dominated by honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa) and a very light understory of buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliare) (see
Photograph B-369).
Artifacts recorded from the surface were predominantly chert lithic debitage from early stage
reduction (107 primary flakes, 45 secondary flakes, 32 tertiary flakes, 30 tested cobbles, and nine
angular debris). Stone tools recovered were limited to nine unidirectional and multidirectional
core tools of chert (see Photographs B-370 to B-372). No diagnostic artifacts or features were
recorded during the delineation of the site. While the potential for subsurface artifacts is
limited, the site does contain a large number of artifacts related to lithic procurement. The
amount of material recorded suggests that the site may have the potential to address research
questions regarding prehistoric lithic procurement and lithic sourcing in south Texas. It is
recommended that the site undergo additional testing to determine its eligibility for the NRHP.
41SR423 (SilverTanks-P-4)
Site 41SR423 was originally recorded from a single positive transect STP (T2-STP1). Ground
visibility at the site was poor to fair (5 to 20 percent) and the site boundaries were determined
through the excavation of an additional five delineation STPs (D-1 to D-5) (see Figure A-108).
Site delineation was largely limited to the survey corridor, which only allowed for a single line
of delineation shovel tests to be excavated paralleling the west side of the road. Two of the
additional five STPs that were excavated during the delineation of 41SR423 were positive for
cultural material (Table 6-60). The site boundary is considered incomplete and the site may
extend further to the west. To the east the site is bounded by a road, as well as a developed

southern boundary is accurate and defined by shovel tests that were negative for cultural
material. The site, as currently defined, measures 43 meters north to south by 23 meters east to
west and has a total site area of 724 square meters.

The site is situated on an upper terrace that overlooks an abandoned channel of a tributary of
Salado Creek to the east. Vegetation at the site is dominated by honey mesquite in the overstory
and buffelgrass in the understory. Other vegetation noted near the site includes Texas paloverde
(Cercidium texanum), huisache (Acacia farnesiana), blackbrush acacia (Acacia rigidula), spiny
hackberry (Celtis ehrenbergiana), and wild lime (Zanthoxylum fagara) (see Photograph B-373).
Artifacts recovered at the site include both prehistoric and historic material. Prehistoric material
was limited to lithic debitage (one primary flake, one secondary flake, 10 tertiary flakes, and one
angular debris). No stone tools or features were recorded at site 41SR423. None of the historic
material recorded could be definitively dated to 50 years old or older and included glass (one
clear curved glass, one aquamarine curved glass) and a single ceramic (one whiteware sherd).
Modern material such as plastic, colorless glass bottles, and chicken wire, was scattered across
the surface of the site. Artifacts were recovered to a depth of 50 centimeters below ground
surface. One delineation shovel test recorded historic material mixed with prehistoric material to
a depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface, which suggests that the deposits may lack
integrity. No diagnostic artifacts or features were recorded during the delineation of the site.
The soil profile of the site consisted of a single stratum of brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam to a depth
of 50 centimeters below ground surface.

While there seems to be some subsurface material present at the site, including historic and
prehistoric material, there is evidence of potential mixing of the prehistoric and historic deposits.
As a result, the site is considered to have a low integrity of deposits. The artifact assemblage
recorded at the site is also limited. Given the site's lack of integrity and limited amount of
recorded cultural material, the site is considered to have little or no potential to address questions
regarding the prehistoric or historic settlement and adaptations in south Texas.

The site was originally recorded from a single positive transect STP (2-6), which recorded
cultural material to a depth of 60 centimeters below ground surface. An additional five
delineation STPs (D-1 to D-4) were excavated, of which one was positive for cultural material
(Table 6-62; see Figure A-110). The soil profile for the positive transect STP consisted of a
brown (7.5YR 5/3) silt loam with gravel to a depth of 20 centimeters below ground surface, a
brown (7.5YR 4/3) silt loam with gravel from 30 to 50 centimeters below ground surface, and a
brown (7.5YR 5/3) silty clay loam from 50 to 80 centimeters below ground surface. The site is
positioned on a slightly sloping but relatively flat upland overlooking the Rio Grande floodplain
to the south. Vegetation at the site was dominated by a sparse overstory of honey mesquite and
an understory of buffelgrass. Ground visibility varied across the site with poor visibility (10 to
20 percent) in the grassy areas beside the road and two-tracks, and good visibility within the
roads and two-tracks (70 to 90 percent) (see Photograph B-381).

A pipeline corridor passes through the northern portion of the site, which prevented further
subsurface testing to the north. The boundaries of the survey corridor prevented further testing
to the west and the STPs excavated on the east side of the road recorded no cultural material,

suggesting that the site does not extend to that side of the road. A two-track within the pipeline
corridor did have some cultural material recorded from the surface on the east side of the road.
Given the limits of the survey corridor, the site boundary is not considered complete. The site, as
currently defined, measures 47 meters northeast to southwest by 7 meters northwest to southeast
and has a total site area of 295 square meters.
Artifacts recovered from the site were limited to chert lithic debitage of latter stage reduction (10
primary, eight secondary, and 24 tertiary flakes). No stone tools, diagnostic cultural material, or
features were recorded during the delineation of the site. Cultural material was recovered from
the STPs to depths ranging from 30 to 60 centimeters below ground surface.
While the site does seem to have subsurface deposits of artifacts, the integrity of the site is
uncertain, as the area has been designated as Pits (Pt) by the soil survey, usually a designation
used to denote areas where active mining/gravel operations have taken place. The 2002 Sullivan
City, TX 7.5-minute and the 1956 Garcias, TX 15-minute topographic quadrangles do not
indicate that the area has been used as a gravel pit, but do show areas further to the north and
northeast as designated gravel pits. The site's eligibility for the NRHP cannot be determined
without additional archival and archaeological work.
6.1.31.2 Historic Resource Investigations
No previously recorded aboveground/architectural historic resources that are listed in the NRHP
or eligible for listing in the NRHP are located within the visual APE of the proposed RGC North

MCALLEN STATION AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY

A total of 20 proposed tower sites along with their associated utility and access corridors were
surveyed for archaeological and historic resources within the McAllen Station AOR. A total of
three archaeological sites were recorded during the surveys conducted within the McAllen
Station AOR. Summaries of the results of the archaeological and historical resource surveys are
organized in the following sections by tower.
6.2.1 MCS GF Military Area Alternate
6.2.1.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 toT1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint during the survey
of the MCS GF Military Area Alternate tower site (Table 6-63; see Figure A-111). The area
encompassing the tower footprint appeared heavily disturbed, with cut banks noted in the
western portion of the tower site and a gravel or caliche pit noted in the northern portion of the
tower footprint and extending north (see Photographs B-382 to B-389). None of the STPs were
positive for archaeological material and no archaeological resources were recorded during the
survey of the MCS GF Military Area Alternate tower site and its associated access and utility
corridors.

was identified. This resulted in the recording of two new archaeological sites and one IO (IOSamFordyce-P-1) during the survey of the MCS South Sam Fordyce Primary tower site and its
associated access corridor (Table 6-64).

The site consists of a surface and subsurface scatter of prehistoric and historic material. The site
was originally recorded from a single positive transect STP (T2-STP7), which recovered two
tertiary flakes, three heavily patinated curved aquamarine glass shards, and a ferrous tubular
fragment. An additional nine STPs were excavated during the delineation of the site (D-1 to D9), of which six were positive for cultural material (Table 6-65; see Figure A-113). Cultural
material was recovered to a depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface. The site has been
impacted by the gravel road, which cuts through the center of the site as delineated. The road
itself is down-cut and is 3 feet below the surrounding ground surface. Parallel barbed wire

fences are located on both sides of the road. Finally, a northeast to southwest trending pipeline
cuts across the southern boundary of the site. Material recovered from shovel tests on the
western side of the road seemed to have more integrity. Material recovered from the east side of
the road had historic material underlying prehistoric material, suggesting that this portion of the
site may be disturbed. Surface visibility during the delineation of the site varied from 90 percent
on the western side of the road to 5 percent on the eastern side of the road, which cuts through
the site. Delineation was largely confined to the survey corridor for the 60-foot access/utility
corridor.

The site is on a relatively flat but slightly southern sloping landform that overlooks the Rio
Grande floodplain to the south. Vegetation noted in the vicinity of the site is dominated by
buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliare) with scattered shrubs including honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa), huisache (Acacia farnesiana), wild lime (Zanthoxylum fagara), Texas ranger
(Leucophyllum frutescens), blackbrush acacia (Acacia rigidula), spiny hackberry (Celtis pallida),
wild olive (Cordia boissieri), coyotillo (Karwinskia humboldtiana), Texas ebony (Chloroleucon
ebano), and Berlandier wolfberry (Lycium berlandieri) (see Photograph B-398). Examination of
the aerial photographs suggests that the area may have been used for agriculture in the past but is
now reverting to shrubland.

Artifacts recovered from the site included prehistoric and historic material. Prehistoric material
was dominated by lithic debitage (one primary flake, two secondary flakes, and five tertiary
flakes of red, tan, and yellow chert). A single stone tool, a white chert multidirectional core tool,
was recovered from the surface (see Photograph B-399). Historic material included heavily
patinated curved glass shards (five aquamarine, two clear glass, and one amber), and one ferrous
tubular fragment. No diagnostic prehistoric or historic material was recorded during the
delineation of the site. As a result, the cultural affiliation of the site is unknown prehistoric and
historic. Given the limited artifact inventory, the site probably represents a limited-use, open
campsite with intrusive historic material. The site boundaries were determined through a
combination of surface expression of artifacts and excavation of STPs. Site delineation was
largely confined to the survey corridor and testing was not extended to the east or west. As a
result, the site boundaries are incomplete and the site may extend further to the west and east. As
currently mapped, the site measures 47 meters north to south by 35 meters east to west and has a
total site area of 1,114 square meters.
While the artifact assemblage is limited and lacks diagnostic material and the eastern portion of
the site has evidence of mixed deposits, the western portion of the site is more intact and includes
subsurface prehistoric material to a depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface. Only the
portion of the site within the current survey corridor was investigated and it is not known
whether portions of the site extend beyond the survey corridor, particularly to the west, where
surface visibility is poor. As a result, site 41HG257 is recommended to have an undetermined
eligibility for the NRHP until the site can be subject to additional archaeological investigations,
including a complete delineation of its boundaries. The portion of the site on the eastern side of
the road lacks integrity with evidence of mixed deposits found to a depth of a depth of 40 cmbgs.
As a result, the portion of the site east of the existing unimproved road retains little integrity and
no additional archaeological investigations are recommended for that portion of the site.
41HG258 (SilverTanks-P-3)
Site 41HG258 was discovered through two positive transect STPs (T1-STP1 and T1-STP2) that
were excavated within the tower footprint, as well as from an associated surface scatter of
artifacts. The site is located on a slight southern slope of a low hill (see Photograph B-400).
Overall surface visibility within the site was good to excellent (30 to 90 percent) with some small
patches of ground cover that provided poor ground visibility (<25 percent). Vegetation at the
site was dominated by buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliare), with few scattered shrubs (1-3 meters tall)
of honey mesquites (Prosopis glandulosa), Texas paloverde (Parkinsonia texanum), and lead
tree (Leucaena leucocephala).
The boundary of the site was determined through the combination of surface expression of
artifacts, as well as excavation of additional delineation STPs in areas of low surface visibility.
Three additional delineations STPs (D-1 to D-3) were excavated in addition to the three transect
STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) that were excavated. A total of four positive shovel tests were
excavated within the boundaries of the site, which included two transect and two delineation
STPs (Table 6-66; see Figure A-114). Artifacts from STPs were recorded to a maximum depth
of 40 centimeters below ground surface. A typical shovel test profile from a positive shovel test
excavated at the site consisted of a single stratigraphic level of brown (10YR 5/3) to pale brown
(10YR 6/3) silt loam to loam, which extended to a depth of 50 centimeters below ground surface.

Some weakly cemented caliche was noted at the bases of several of the STPs excavated, which
prevented deeper excavation. Site delineation was largely limited to the boundaries of the survey
area itself, but a reconnaissance to the north and northwest of the survey area noted that the site
extends in both directions and may be more concentrated near the top of the low hill to the north
and northwest. As a result, the current site boundary is not considered complete. The site
boundary, as currently defined, measures 85 meters north to south by 59 meters east to west and
has a total site area of 3,261 square meters.

Artifacts recorded at the site include lithic debitage and stone tools. Lithic debitage consisted of
one primary flake, six secondary flakes, 10 tertiary flakes, and seven flakes whose reduction was
not noted. All the lithic debitage was chert. Stone tools recorded at the site include five
unidirectional and multidirectional core tools, one hafted biface (Matamoros type point), and one
medial biface fragment (see Photographs B-401 to B-404). The Matamoros projectile point dates
to a relatively broad range from the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods. The medial biface
fragment could not be identified to a known type. In addition to the artifacts noted above,
thermally altered rock was noted across the site area. While no discrete concentrations of
thermally altered rock were noted during the delineation, the presence of thermally altered rock
across the site suggests that unidentified thermal features may be present. Given the artifact
assemblage, the site probably represents an open campsite and resource processing locus. Given
the presence of diagnostic material, stone tools, thermally altered rock, and subsurface deposits
across the site, the site has potential to have intact deposits that may provide information on
prehistoric adaptations in the area. Additional work, including more extensive subsurface
testing, would be needed to determine whether the site is eligible for the NRHP.
IO-SamFordyce-P-1 (SamFordyce-P-1)
IO-SamFordyce-1 was recorded from a positive transect STP (T2-STP1), which recovered
modern amber and clear glass from 0 to 30 cmbgs and a tertiary flake of black chert from 30-40
cmbgs. The locus was bounded to the west by an existing access road and a slurry pit from the
excavation of a sewer or water pipe. The east was bounded by the survey corridor. Testing was
limited to the survey corridor and included excavation of three addition STPs to the north and
south (Table 6-67; see Figure A-115). The STPs to the south were placed to avoid washout from

the slurry pit which was running into the survey corridor from the west (see Photograph B-405).
Material recovered from the STPs was limited to modern artifacts and a single fractured rock
fragment which was determined to not be culturally modified and possible road gravel from
either the construction of the access road or U.S. Highway 83. Given the modern nature of the
majority of the material recovered, the locus is considered to be an IO of a single black chert
flake. No additional archaeological work is recommended for the IO and the IO is not
considered to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

Three STPs were excavated at the tower footprint (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) (see Photographs B406 to B-413; Table 6-68). The MCS South Sam Fordyce Alternate tower site shares a portion
of the access and utility corridor for the MCS South Sam Fordyce Primary tower site. As a
result, the results of the survey for that portion of the access road (T2-STP1 through T2-STP7)
are the same (see Figure A-116). One archaeological site (41HG257 [SamFordyce-P-2]) and one
IO (IO-SamFordyce-P-1 [SamFordyce-P-1]) were recorded during the survey of the MCS South
Sam Fordyce Alternate tower site and its associated access and utility corridor. Descriptions of
the site and IO are provided in Section 6.2.2, which describes the results of the survey of the
MCS South Sam Fordyce Primary tower site.

6.2.4.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint during the survey
of the MCS Banworth Canal Primary tower site (Table 6-69; see Figure A-117). While the
heavy clay content and compaction of the soils prevented testing deeper than 30 cmbgs, the
survey area is within a recently plowed field with good to excellent surface visibility (70-80
percent) (see Photographs B-414 to B-421). None of the STPs were positive for archaeological
material and no archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of the MCS Banworth
Canal Primary tower site.

6.2.4.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource, identified by GSRC personnel, was recorded
within the visual APE of the proposed MCS Banworth Canal Primary tower site. Havana
Cemetery (Cemetery ID No. HG-C066) (see Photograph 422) is located 0.51 km (0.32 mile)
northwest from the center of the tower site. The cemetery was established circa 1887. It is

approximately 1.06 acres and is surrounded by a 3-foot-tall chain-link fence. A chain-link gate
sits on the north (primary) side of the cemetery. A flagpole sits to the right of the gate. The
proposed tower site is visible from the cemetery, but is not considered an adverse visual element
due to the presence of existing towers. The existing structures present in the visual APE of the
tower site consist of residential and commercial buildings.
One OTHM, identified by GSRC personnel, is recorded within the visual APE of the proposed
MCS Banworth Canal Primary tower site. The OTHM is the Havana marker (Marker No. 2408).
The marker is a medallion with a plaque. The proposed MCS Banworth Canal Primary tower
site is visible from this historic site and, while it does constitute an adverse visual element, the
resource would not be directly impacted because the use of adjacent properties have change
dramatically, as well as already present adverse visual elements. As a result, no adverse effects
on architectural or aboveground resources that are eligible for the NRHP are anticipated.

excavated during the delineation of the locus (Table 6-71; see Figure A-119). One (D-1) of the
four STPs excavated during the delineation of the site was positive for cultural material. Modern
material was also noted in one additional STP (D-3). Given the modern nature of the majority of
the material recorded during the delineation of the locus, the limited definitive prehistoric
material recovered, and the questionable integrity of the deposits since they are located within a
settling basin, the locus is considered to be an IO (IO-Banworth-A-1). The IO is not considered
eligible for the NRHP and no further archaeological work is recommended for the MCS
Banworth Canal Alternate tower site.

6.2.7 MCS HC Irrigation District #6 Tertiary Option 1
6.2.7.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated during the survey of the MC HC Irrigation
District #6 Tertiary Option 1 tower site and associated utility corridor (Table 6-73; see Figure A121). The northern portion of the tower footprint was previously disturbed by a buried pipeline
and the southern portion of the tower footprint had an existing temporary RVSS tower installed
(see Photographs B-440 to B-447). As a result, the STPs were placed between the pipeline
corridor and the temporary tower site. None of the STPs excavated within the tower footprint
were positive for cultural material. Disturbance from the Highway right-of-way and from a
buried gas pipeline prevented the excavation of STPs along the 30-ft utility corridor. One
surface scatter of artifacts was recorded within the utility corridor and extending slightly into the
tower footprint. This resulted in the recording of one archaeological site (41HG259) during the
survey of the MCS HC Irrigation District #6 Tertiary Option 1 tower site and associated utility
corridor.

41HG259 (Irrigation-Tert-1-1)
Site 41HG259 was originally recorded from a surface scatter of artifacts within a buried gas
pipeline right-of-way. The buried gas pipeline right-of-way and disturbed right-of-way of
Military Road took up the entire survey corridor, which did not allow for any subsurface testing
within the site boundaries. As a result, the site boundaries were determined by the surface
expression of artifacts alone (see Figure A-122). Site delineation was largely confined to the
survey corridor, though a limited surface reconnaissance was conducted outside of the survey
corridor to determine if the site extended further. To the north, site delineation was limited to the
property fence line, although a very heavy concentration of historic cultural material was noted
within the built-up and disturbed Military Road right-of-way. Additionally, cultural material was
noted outside of the survey corridor and disturbed pipeline right-of-way to the south. Given that
only a limited surface reconnaissance was conducted outside of the survey corridor, the site
boundaries are not considered to be complete (see Photograph B-448). The site, as currently
defined, measures 95 meters east-west by 28 meters north-south and has a total site area of 2,229
square meters.
The site is positioned on the relatively flat floodplain of the Rio Grande River. A large portion
of the site is within a fallow and maintained open field of grass. Heavier vegetation, consisting
predominantly of an overstory of honey mesquite and buffelgrass understory, exists within the
disturbed highway right-of-way between the property fence line and the edge of the highway.
Artifacts recovered from the site consisted of a mix of both prehistoric and historic cultural
material, all of which were recorded from the surface. Prehistoric artifacts consisted of lithic
debitage, stone tools, and thermally altered rock. Lithic debitage consisted of chert and included
seven primary flakes, eight secondary flakes, 11 tertiary flakes, and seven pieces of angular
debris. Stone tools included both hafted and unhafted bifaces, as well as a core tool
(Photographs B-449 to B-458). Hafted bifaces recorded during the delineation of the site
included three possible projectile points and point fragments. One hafted biface (T.1) was thick
and very crudely worked. The blade is oval in form, and the tool has very slight barbs and a
bulbous and rounded stem. While the projectile point resembles the Lone Oak type projectile
point, that type is not common to the area. Given how crudely it is worked, the tool probably
represents a preform. A second hafted biface (T.2) was limited to a proximal fragment of white
chert. The projectile point is triangular in form, with a slightly concave base and evidence of
basal thinning and grinding. The hafted biface probably represents an Early Triangular type,
which is attributed to the Early Archaic period (ca. 3700 to 3600 B.C.). The third hafted biface
(T.4) is elongate triangular in form and made of tan chert. The base is slightly concave and
thinned with vertical flaking. Given its form, the biface is most likely a Kinney Type, which has
been found in association with Middle Archaic occupations. The unhafted biface (T.5) is
circular in form and made of gray chert. The core tool (T.3) is a unidirectional core tool that
represents a turtleback scraper. A single prehistoric feature (F.1), consisting of a light
concentration of 13 fragments of thermally altered rock within a 14-square-meter area, was
recorded during the delineation of the site (see Photograph B-459). The feature may represent a
dispersed hearth.

Historic artifacts recorded at the site include ceramic, glass, metal, and brick. Ceramic artifacts
included decorated and 20+ undecorated whiteware (1830 to present), 20+ undecorated ironstone
(1840 to 1930), and undecorated porcelain (1800 to present) (see Photographs B-460 to B-461)
(Florida Museum of Natural History [FLMNH 2016]). Decoration noted on whiteware included
handpainted (1830 to present), annular (1830 to twentieth century), transfer print (black [ca.
1830 to 1850] and light blue [ca. 1826 to 1831]), and fiestaware (FLMNH 2016; Stelle 2011).
Porcelain ceramics included plain body sherds, as well as a porcelain insulator. Glass artifacts
were dominated by curved colorless shards (50+), but also included curved milk (20+) (ca. 1870s
to present), curved olive (10), curved aquamarine (5), curved cobalt blue (5), curved solarized
manganese (2) (ca. 1870s to 1920s), and curved black (dark olive) (1) (ca. 1840s to 1880s) glass
shards (see Photographs B-462 to B-464) (Lockhart 2006; Lindsey 2010a). A single rounded
bottle base fragment was found, which dates ca. 1870s to 1910s (Lindsey 2010b). Metal artifacts
were limited to a single 9mm bullet. Finally, a single brick fragment was noted during the
delineation. Faunal material was limited to unidentifiable bone fragments.
Given the artifact assemblage, the site has at least two occupations, including a prehistoric early
to Middle Archaic occupation that represents an open campsite, as well as a historic farmstead
that extended from the middle 1800s into the twentieth century. The general lack of architectural
material and the heavier concentration of historic artifacts noted in the Military Road right-ofway suggests that the original farmstead might be located further north and may have been
destroyed by the construction of Military Road. While neither the 2016 nor 1963 La Joya, TX
7.5-minute topographic quadrangles note any structures in the vicinity of the site, the 1916
Mission, TX 15-minute topographic quadrangle does show a structure immediately north of
Military Road and the railroad. The portion of the site within the current survey area has been
completely disturbed through the construction of a gas pipeline and Military Road. A surface
reconnaissance outside of the survey corridor noted additional artifacts to the south and the site
extends beyond the survey corridor and disturbance from the buried gas line. As a result, the
eligibility of the site cannot be determined without additional archaeological investigations.
While the site is recommended to have an undetermined eligibility for the NRHP, the portion of
the site within the tower footprint and utility corridor is completely disturbed and not a
contributing element of the site’s potential eligibility for the NRHP.

access and utility corridor (see Photographs B-507 to B-514). The area encompassing the tower
footprint had an existing temporary tower present. Push piles were also present near the edges of
the tower footprint, which suggests that the area was cleared, grubbed, and leveled previously.
Modern material was noted in one of the STPs excavated but was determined to be not historic in
the field. None of the STPs were positive for archaeological material and no archaeological
resources were recorded during the survey of the MCS Inspiration Canal Alternate tower site and

6.2.13.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One non-historic aboveground resource identified by GSRC personnel, was recorded within the
visual APE of the proposed MCS Inspiration Canal Alternate tower site. The Rio Grande Valley
State Veterans Cemetery is unnumbered by THC and is located 0.58 km (0.36 mile) south from
the center of the tower site. The cemetery was established in 2006. It is approximately 25 acres
and is surrounded by grass lawns. The front entrance to the cemetery has a stucco clad arch with
signage that reads RIO GRANDE VALLEY STATE VETERANS CEMETERY and sits on the
east (primary) side of the cemetery. The tower site is likely to be visible all points in the
cemetery but does not constitute as an adverse visual element, as there are existing towers and
new construction within the area already. Additional structures present in the visual APE of the
tower site consist of small residential and commercial buildings, as well as farmland.
6.2.14 MCS Madero Primary
6.2.14.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) within the tower footprint and four STP (T2-STP1 to T2STP4) were excavated during the survey of the MCS Madero Primary tower site and its
associated access and utility corridor (see Photographs B-515 to B-522). The area of the tower
was within an existing citrus grove, and ground visibility across the tower site and northern
portion of the access and utility corridor was excellent (95 to 100 percent). One of the STPs was
positive for archaeological material, which resulted in the recording of one IO (IO-Madero-P-1)
during the survey of the MCS Madero Primary tower site and its associated access and utility
corridor (Table 6-80; see Figure A-129).

IO-Madero-P-1 (Madero-P-1)
IO-Madero-P-1 was originally recorded from a single positive STP, T2-STP3. A single
secondary chert flake was recovered from the STP. An additional five STPs (D-1 to D-5) were
excavated to further delineate the find and to assess if any additional sub-surface cultural
material was present (see Figure A-130). None of the additional excavated STPs were positive
for cultural material (Table 6-81). An extensive surface examination of the area identified one
additional artifact, a flake of chert. Given the limited amount of material found the locus is
considered to be an IO (IO-Madero-P-1) and not an archaeological site. IO-Madero-P-1 by its
nature is not considered significant and is not considered to be eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP.

6.2.14.2 Historic Resource Investigations
The NRHP-listed La Lomita Historic District (Reference No. 75002165) is located within the
visual APE of the proposed MCS Madero Primary tower site. The District is approximately 3.45
acres in total and is located approximately 5 miles south of Mission, Texas, on the south side of
FM 1016, on the hill above the Rio Grande River. Inside the boundaries of the historic district,
there is one architecturally significant structure, built in 1899 by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate
as a chapel meant to serve the ranch workers at Rancho La Lomita. The City of Mission, Texas,
was named for the La Lomita Mission. The Mission became a RTHL in 1964, and was listed in
the National Register in 1975 under the areas of local significance in transportation, exploration
and settlement, architecture, and religion, with periods of significance from 1875-1924. The
Mission itself (see Photograph B-523) is located 0.25 km (0.16 mile) northwest from the center
of the tower site. The tower site is likely to be visible from all points in the District but does not
constitute an adverse visual element, as there are existing towers within the area already, as well
as new construction. Other existing structures present in the visual APE of the tower site are a
combination of large and small commercial and residential buildings, and the Anzalduas
recreational park to the north and west of the District.
One OTHM, identified by GSRC personnel, is recorded within the visual APE of the proposed
MCS Madero Primary tower site. The OTHM is the La Lomita Chapel marker (Marker No.
2997) (see Photograph B-527). The marker is a medallion, with two plaques beneath. One
plaque is for the state listing, and the other plaque is for the National Register listing. The
proposed MCS Madero Primary tower site is visible from the marker and, while it does
constitute an adverse visual element, the resource would not be directly impacted because the use
of adjacent properties has changed dramatically, as well as already present adverse visual
elements. As a result, no adverse effects on architectural or aboveground resources that are
eligible for the NRHP are anticipated.

Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) within the tower footprint were excavated during the survey
of the MCS Floodway Tertiary Option 1 tower site and its associated access road corridor (see
Photographs B-529 to B-536). The footprint of the 30-ft access road was taken up entirely by an
existing levee and an asphalt and concrete road. As a result, no STPs were excavated along the
access road and the access road was subject to pedestrian survey. The area encompassing the
tower footprint was in a fallow field with relatively poor surface visibility (10 to 20 percent).
None of the STPs were positive for archaeological material and no archaeological resources were
recorded during the survey of the MCS Floodway Tertiary Option 1 tower site and its associated
access and utility corridor (Table 6-83; see Figure A-132).

and North 23rd Street), east/west just south of Freddy Gonzalez Drive in Edinburgh, returns
south at County Road 5959C and Border Road, and stops just south of Military Highway at the
southern border. The boundaries of the historic district inside the APE include approximately 11
blocks of the historic district and include two groups of architecturally significant structures, the
Old Hidalgo Courthouse and Buildings (NRHP No. 80004136) by Juan Rios, and the First-Lift
Pumphouse (Reference No. 95001284).
The Old Hidalgo Courthouse and Buildings (see Photograph B-569) are located at Flora and 1st
Streets. They were constructed circa 1875 by Juan Rios, and the areas of significance include
politics/government, exploration/settlement, architecture, and commerce, with a period of
significance of 1875-1899. Additionally, the Old Hidalgo Pumphouse Museum and World
Birding Center (National Register No. 80004136) lies within the APE (see Photograph B-570).
The lower Rio Grande Valley was only suitable for a cattle grazing up until steam-powered
irrigation was introduced to the area in the early 1900s. After the establishment of the irrigation
plant, approximately 40,000 acres of land was able to be irrigated, which contributed to the
expansion of Pharr/San Juan/Alamo areas.
The proposed MCS Hidalgo POE Alternate tower site is visible from this historic district, and
while it does constitute an adverse visual element, the resources would not be directly impacted,
as adverse visual elements already exist, such as a new water tower and existing communications
towers. As a result, no adverse effects on architectural or aboveground resources that are eligible
for the NRHP are anticipated. Other structures present are a combination of large and small
commercial and residential buildings, communications towers, a water tower, and new municipal
buildings.
One OTHM, identified by GSRC personnel, is recorded within the visual APE of the proposed
MCS Hidalgo POE Alternative tower site. The OTHM is the Old Hidalgo Pumphouse Museum
and World Birding Center marker (Marker No. 2408). The marker is a medallion with a plaque.

organized by tower.
6.3.1 WSL South Settling Basin Alternate
6.3.1.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) within the tower footprint were excavated during the survey
of the MCS South Settling Basin Alternate tower site and its associated access road and utility
corridor (see Photographs B-571 to B-578). The entire survey corridor of the access and utility
corridor was within the footprint of an existing gas pipeline, which prevented the excavation of
STPs. This portion of the access and utility corridor was subject to pedestrian survey. None of
the STPs were positive for archaeological material and no archaeological resources were
recorded during the survey of the MCS South Settling Basin Alternate tower site and its
associated access and utility corridor (Table 6-88; see Figure A-137).

APE of the tower site.
6.3.2 WSL Dyer’s Farm Primary
6.3.2.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and 18 STPs (T2STP1 to T2-STP18) were excavated along the access and utility corridor during the survey of the
MCS Dyer’s Farm Primary tower site and its associated access road and utility corridor (see
Photographs B-579 to B-586). The final five shovel tests along the access and utility corridor
were not excavated, as the survey corridor is on top of a man-made levee structure. This portion
of the survey corridor was subject to pedestrian survey. One sherd of modern ceramic was
recovered in a STP but was determined to be not historic in the field. None of the STPs were
positive for archaeological material and no archaeological resources were recorded during the
survey of the WSL Dyer’s Farm Primary tower site and its associated access and utility corridor
(Table 6-89; see Figure A-138).

6.3.3.2 Historic Resource Investigations
No previously recorded aboveground/architectural historic resources that are listed in the NRHP
or eligible for listing in the NRHP are located within the visual APE of the proposed WSL
Dyer’s Farm Alternate site. The existing structures visible within the visual APE of the tower site
are utility and small commercial buildings.
6.3.4 WSL Pharr POE South Tertiary Option 1
6.3.4.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The area encompassing the proposed WSL Pharr POE South Tertiary Option 1 tower site and its
associated access road was previously surveyed by two investigations (491 and 500) that overlap
completely with the proposed tower footprint and access road. In addition, two archaeological
sites recorded during those surveys (41HG162 and 41HG163) have been evaluated for inclusion
in the NRHP and have been determined to be ineligible. Aerial photographs note that the area
has been completely cleared and leveled as recently as 2014. Currently there is a temporary
tower site established on the site (see Photographs B-595 to B-602). As a result, no subsurface
testing was conducted at the tower site or along the access road, but both areas were subject to
pedestrian survey.

6.3.4.2 Historic Resource Investigations
The proposed WSL Pharr POE South Tertiary Option 1 tower site is within the boundary of the
Louisiana – Rio Grande Canal Company Irrigation System NRHP-listed historic district
(Reference No. 95001284). The historic district contains approximately 3,135 acres and runs
from the Rio Grande in the south, north along Bridge Street (which turns into Depot Street and
North 23rd Street), and east/west just south of Freddy Gonzalez Drive in Edinburgh, and returns
south at County Road 5959C and Border Road, and stops just south of Military Road at the
southern border.
The proposed Pharr POE Tertiary Option 1 tower site is visible from this historic district, and
while it does constitute an adverse visual element, the resources would not be directly impacted,
as already present adverse visual elements exist, such as a new water tower and existing
communications towers. As a result, no adverse effects on architectural or aboveground
resources that are eligible for the NRHP are anticipated. Other structures present are a
combination of large and small commercial and residential buildings, communications towers, a
water tower, and new municipal buildings. The existing structures visible within the visual APE
of the tower site are small utility buildings.
One aboveground/architectural historic resource, identified by GSRC personnel, was recorded
within the visual APE of the proposed WSL Pharr POE South POE Tertiary Option 1 tower site.
An unnamed and unnumbered cemetery (see Photograph B-603) is located 0.57 km (0.36 mile)
northeast from the center of the tower site. The date of the establishment of the cemetery is
unknown. The cemetery is located off Pharr International Bridge Road, and south of Doffin
Canal Road, in the middle of farmland. It is approximately 0.39 acre and is surrounded by a 3foot-tall chain-link fence. A chain-link gate sits on the north (primary) side of the cemetery.
The tower site is likely to be visible from all points in the cemetery but does not constitute an
adverse visual element, as there are existing towers within the area already. Additional
structures present in the APE consist of small utility buildings, as well as farmland.
6.3.5 WSL Pharr POE South Tertiary Option 2
6.3.5.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and four STPs
(T2-STP1 to T2-STP4) were excavated along the access and utility corridor during the survey of
the MCS Pharr POE South Tertiary Option 2 tower site and its associated access road and utility
corridor (see Photographs B-604 to B-611). None of the STPs were positive for archaeological
material and no archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of the WSL Parr POE
South Tertiary Option 2 tower site and its associated access and utility corridor (Table 6-91; see
Figure A-140).

MCS Pig Pen Road Primary tower site and its associated access road and utility corridor (see
Photographs B-612 to B-618). After the initial survey of the tower and its associated access and
utility corridor, the access road for the site was realigned. An additional three STPs (T3-STP1 to
T3-STP3) were excavated along the realigned access corridor of the tower site. None of the

6.3.9.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource, identified by GSRC personnel, was recorded
within the visual APE of the proposed WSL South Tower Road Primary tower site. An unnamed
and unnumbered cemetery (Photograph B-640) is located 0.39 km (0.24 mile) northeast of the
center of the tower site. The date of the establishment of the cemetery is unknown. The
cemetery is located off Levy Road and west of South Valley View Road. It is approximately
0.85 acre and is surrounded by a 3-foot-tall chain-link fence. A chain-link gate sits on the south
(primary) side of the cemetery. The tower site is likely to be visible from all points in the

Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint during the survey
of the MCS Retamal South Primary tower site (see Photographs B-673 to B-678). The existing
road and paralleling water irrigation lines on both sides of the 30-ft access corridor prevented
excavation of STPs along that portion. The 60-foot access and utility corridor was entirely
within the footprint of an approximately 10-foot-high levee road, which also prevented the
excavation of STPs. Both these sections were subject to pedestrian survey. None of the STPs
were positive for archaeological material and no archaeological resources were recorded during
the survey of the WSL Donna Canal Alternate tower site and its associated access and utility
corridor (Table 6-100; see Figure A-149). The previously recorded archaeological site
(41HG35), which overlaps with a portion of the 60-foot access and utility corridor were not
relocated during the current survey. This portion of the survey corridor is on top of an
approximately 10-ft-high levee, which encompasses the entire survey corridor. It is likely that
the site has been destroyed by the construction of the levee.

6.3.15.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
The area encompassing the tower footprint of the MCS Retamal South Alternate tower site has
been heavily disturbed with pushpiles evident along the edges of the tower footprint and a deep
irrigation ditch and buried irrigation pipeline extending across a portion of the tower site (see
Photographs B-679 to B-686). Given the heavy disturbance and presence of a buried pipeline,
STPs were not excavated at the tower site. The survey corridor of the 30-foot access road was
entirely encompassed by an existing unimproved road and associated drainage ditches which also
prevented the excavation of STPs along the access road. The tower footprint and access road
had good to excellent surface visibility (80 to 90 percent) and were subject to pedestrian survey.
No archaeological resources were recorded during the survey of the WSL Retamal South
Alternate tower site and its associated access corridor.

6.3.17.1 Archaeological Resource Investigations
Three STPs (T1-STP1 to T1-STP3) were excavated within the tower footprint and three STPs

Whiskey Tree Alternate tower site (see Photographs B-695 to B-701). Two of the STPs (T2STP2 and T2-STP3) excavated along the access road encountered a buried white plastic sheet at
10 cmbs, which indicated that an unmarked buried utility or irrigation line was present along
both side of the access road. Given the presence of a buried line, no additional STPs were
excavated along the original access corridor and that portion of the road was subject to
pedestrian survey. After the original access road was surveyed a new realigned access road was
developed. The realigned access road followed an existing unimproved road which
encompassed the whole 30-ft corridor. As a result, excavation of STPs along the realigned
access road was not possible and the road was subject to pedestrian survey. None of the STPs
were positive for archaeological material and no archaeological resources were recorded during
the survey of the WSL Whiskey Tree Alternate tower site and its associated access and utility

6.3.17.2 Historic Resource Investigations
One aboveground/architectural historic resource, identified by GSRC personnel, was recorded
within the visual APE of the proposed WSL Whiskey Tree Alternate tower site. Guzman-Toluca
Cemetery (Cemetery ID No. HG-C005) (see Photograph B-702) is located 0.57 km (0.36 mile)
northeast from the center of the tower site. The cemetery was established circa 1904. It is
approximately 0.30 acre and is surrounded by a 3-foot-tall chain-link fence. A chain-link gate
sits on the west (primary) side of the cemetery. The tower site is likely to be visible from all
points in the cemetery, but does not constitute an adverse visual element, as there are existing
towers and new construction within the area already. The additional structures present within the
visual APE of the tower consist of grain silos, commercial buildings, and farmland.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

GSRC personnel conducted intensive pedestrian archaeological surveys at 68 proposed primary,
alternate, tertiary option, and relay tower location sites for the Rio Grande Valley RVSS Upgrade
project. Surveys conducted included both pedestrian survey and excavation of STPs across the
tower sites as well their associated access and utility corridors. A total of 28 archaeological
resources were recorded during the surveys. Another two previously recorded archaeological
resources were revisited and updated during the archaeological survey conducted for this project.
Table 7-1 summarizes the eligibility recommendations for the new and updated archaeological
resources identified during this survey. Eleven of the 28 archaeological sites recorded are
recommended Not Eligible for listing in the NRHP. No additional archaeological investigations
are recommended for these archaeological resources. The remaining 17 archaeological resources
would require additional testing to determine their eligibility for the NRHP and are
recommended to have an undetermined eligibility until additional testing can be done to
determine if they are indeed eligible for the NRHP. Only a limited portion of those sites have
been recorded during the current survey due to the limits of the survey corridor.

determine the extent and integrity of the newly
recorded portions of the site.

Two previously recorded archaeological sites were also revisited and updated. Site 41SR395
consisted of a previously recorded prehistoric site. The limited STPs excavated at the site during
the current survey confirmed the presence of subsurface deposits and a surface reconnaissance of
the site noted that its condition has changed little since it was initially recorded. As a result,
GSRC personnel concur with the recommendations of the original recorders that the site is
eligible for the NRHP. The second previously recorded site, 41SR403, consists of a prehistoric
site that is interpreted to be a prehistoric quarry and resource procurement site. The original
recorders recommended the site as not eligible for listing in the NRHP. During the current
survey an extension of the site was recorded, which contained stone tools and possible
subsurface deposits. The surface scatter of artifacts extended beyond the current survey
boundaries to both the north and south. Given the extent of the newly recorded portion of the
site and the fact that the site could not be fully documented due to the limits of the survey
corridor, GSRC recommends that the site have an undetermined eligibility until additional
investigations can be done and the boundaries of the site can be more fully defined.
The aboveground/architectural historic resource survey revisited previously recorded NRHPlisted and NRHP-eligible historic resources, OTHMs including RTHLs, and cemeteries that were
located within the 0.5-mile visual APE of each of the proposed tower sites. One new
aboveground/architectural historic resource was noted during the historic resource surveys,
which consisted of a newly recorded cemetery (Chapeno-2).
Table 7-2 presents the recommended effects determination for each of the proposed tower sites
surveyed during the current investigation. The effects determination assumes that the entire
proposed tower site and its associated access and utility corridors as mapped would be disturbed.
For the purpose of the effects determination, sites with an undetermined eligibility that would be
affected by construction are considered to have an adverse effect unless NRHP eligibility testing
and data recovery mitigation measures, if necessary, are implemented. Only
aboveground/architectural historic resources that are listed or are eligible for listing in the NRHP
were considered in determining the effects determinations for each of the proposed tower sites.
