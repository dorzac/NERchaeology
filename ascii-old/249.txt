ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for the proposed LaSalle to League Line Gravity
Sewer Main project in Montgomery County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley
Research Associates (BVRA) for the City of Conroe on November 29 and 30, 2010
under Antiquities Permit 5818. The project consists of 4.6 miles of proposed sewer
lines and three lift station locations. In all, thirty-seven acres were surveyed. One
previously recorded prehistoric site (41MQ215) is in the vicinity of the Area of
Potential Effect (APE). It was recorded by archaeologists from SWCA in 2007, but
they only examined a portion of the site. No evidence of this site was found in the
current APE. No new archaeological sites were found, and no artifacts were
collected. Copies of the report are on file at the Texas Historical Commission,
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, the Texas State Library, City of Conroe,
and BVRA.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The City of Conroe plans to install a gravity sewer main in the city limits of
Conroe, Texas (Figure 1). The route of the proposed sewer main consists of
segments parallel to existing roads and cross-country segments. The proposed
sewer line will be installed by trenching for a distance of approximately 3.6 miles
and directional boring for a distance of approximately one mile. Boring will be
performed in areas that closely parallel creeks and at creek crossings. Typically,
the location of the entry holes will be at least 100 feet from the creek banks. The
nearest major source of water is the West Fork of the San Jacinto River that is
300 meters southwest of the southernmost part of the project area at its closest
point. A few small streams and tributaries are also in the area. They are the
headwaters of larger creeks, are intermittent, and are not named. The project
area and previously recorded site 41MQ215 is depicted on two USGS 7.5’
topographic quadrangles Cowl Spur (3095-241) and Shepard Hill (3095-244)
(Figure 2).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the project area. The client is the City of Conroe, and
BVRA was retained to perform the archaeological survey. William E. Moore was
the Principal Investigator, and Edward P. Baxter was the Project Archaeologist.
The field survey involved nineteen person hours in the field and was performed
on November 29 and 30, 2010. The reviewing agency is the Texas Historical
Commission. No sites were found, and no artifacts were collected.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas were checked for the
presence of previously recorded sites and prior archaeological surveys and projects
in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work
in Montgomery County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of
prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. Those reports reviewed include work
in the San Jacinto River Basin by Harry J. Shafer (1968), investigation of a 450acre tract in Harris and Montgomery counties by BVRA (Moore 1991), a survey by
SWCS Environmental Consultants (Crow 2007), and three surveys in the city limits
of Conroe by BVRA (Moore and Baxter 2010a, 2010b, 2010c).
The project area was investigated by a surface inspection and shovel tests.
Special attention was given to the area near site 41MQ215. Shovel tests were dug
to sterile clay, and excavated matrix from the tests was screened using ¼ inch
hardware cloth. Information regarding the shovel tests was entered onto a log
(Appendix I), and the project was documented through field notes, a hand-held
GPS, and digital photography. The number of shovel tests excavated in the project
area is 73, and their approximate location is depicted in Figure 2 above.

RESULTS
Examination of the site files at TARL in Austin and the Atlas revealed one
previously recorded site (41MQ215) in close proximity to the project area. This is
a prehistoric site recorded in 2007 by SWCA Environmental Consultants (Crow
2007). They reported debitage, shatter, a possible awl made from silicified wood,
tested cobble, fragment of fire-cracked rock, one thermally altered core, and one
piece of quartzite shatter. That portion of the site they examined is on a slope of
a terrace overlooking Lake Conroe approximately forty meters to the west. They
determined the thickness of cultural deposits to be fifty centimeters. No further
work was recommended, but the top of the hill near the current APE was not
investigated. The area near the site was negative in terms of yielding cultural
materials. At the time of this investigation, the project area near the site was in
disturbed pasture with good surface visibility. The rest of the project area was in
disturbed pasture, thick woods, and private lawns. Figure 3 illustrates the
conditions encountered in the vicinity of site 41MQ215.
Sixty-three of the seventy-three shovel tests encountered clay at or within
ten centimeters of the surface. In the remaining tests, clay was present between
fifteen and sixty centimeters. Only one shovel test recorded sixty centimeters in
depth before clay was reached. The majority of the project area contained hardpacked clay at the surface. No standing structures or evidence of structures were
observed within the Area of Potential Effect. No archaeological sites were found
during this survey, and shovel testing in the vicinity of 41MQ215 did not produce
cultural materials.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of an archaeological site was found as a result of this survey. It
is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as planned.
Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the construction
of the gravity sewer line, all work must stop until the Texas Historical Commission
can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission.
