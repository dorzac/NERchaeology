ABSTRACT

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC conducted an archaeological assessment on property
associated with proposed Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) road widening
Project CSJ Number 1685-07-005 in Harris County, Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit
number 4286 was issued for this project.
Background research indicates that there is one archaeological site recorded within 1
kilometer (0.62 miles) of the project area. This site, 41HR412, is a prehistoric open
campsite. Fieldwork consisting of a pedestrian survey found the entire Area of Potential
Effect (APE) greatly disturbed by previous construction. Given the extent of disturbances
caused by construction in the APE and the lack of any cultural resources near the APE that
might be impacted by the project, HRA Gray & Pape recommend that no further work be
required and that TxDOT Project CSJ Number 1685-07-005 be cleared to proceed as
planned.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION

HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape), at the request of Berg-Oliver
Associates, Inc. conducted an archaeological assessment on property associated with Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Project CSJ Number 1685-07-005 in Harris County,
Texas (Figure 1). The project involves an estimated 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) of road
expansion along a section of (BF) 1960A located between Lee Road and Farm-to-Market
(FM) Road 1960 in Harris County, Texas. Within much of the project area, FM 1960 is
proposed for widening between approximately 18.3 to 100.6 meters (60 to 330 feet). The
Lead Federal Agency identified for this project is the Federal Highways Administration
(FHWA).
The goals of this investigation were to determine if the initiation of this project would
affect any previously identified historic properties as defined by Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended (36 CFR 800), and to assess the
potential for previously unidentified cultural resources to be located within the project’s Area
of Potential Effect (APE). Texas Antiquities Permit number 4323 was issued for this project.

REPORT ORGANIZATION
This document is organized into six numbered chapters and two lettered appendices.
Chapter I, is an introductory chapter describing the project and report organization. Chapter
II summarizes research design with respect to background research and field methods.
Chapter III summarizes the environmental setting of project area. Chapter IV summarizes
recent cultural resources management investigations in the vicinity of the project in light of
the broader cultural context of the project area in the region. Chapter V presents the results
of archaeological fieldwork, and Chapter VI provides conclusions and recommendations for
the project. Project plans are provided in Appendix A. A copy of the TxDOT provided
Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) is provided in Appendix B.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project area is associated with BF 1960A. This expansion will begin west of Lee
Road and extend to the east through Bordersville and Humble, Texas to FM 1960 (see Figure
1). Several alternates are proposed which have an impact on the geometry of the APE (Table
1). In total, this APE consists of approximately 24.4 hectares (57.9 acres) of land. Project
plans provided to HRA Gray & Pape at the time of permit application indicated that the APE
includes a linear corridor that is approximately 6.4 kilometers (4 miles) in length and
between 10.3 to 36.6 meters (60 to 120 feet) in width. The exception to this width is through

the Town of Humble, where one alternative involves one-way pairs eastbound on the BF
1960 and westbound on Second Street. There, the APE will widen at the junctions of the oneway pairs in Humble to a maximum width of 42.7 meters (140 feet) at the western junction
and a maximum width of 100.6 meters (330 feet) at the eastern junction. The APE depth is
estimated to be approximately 91.5 centimeters (3 feet) throughout the project area.
Table 1. ROW width for proposed alternatives in West, Central, and East project segments1.
West Segment:
Existing ROW = 100’ (except between Carver and Borders Roads – 60’ within this short stretch).
West Alternative 1: Expand to 100’ (4-lane, curb-and-gutter drainage, no median)
Alt. 1a – where ROW expansion is required, take the additional ROW equally from both sides
Alt. 1b - where ROW expansion is required, take the additional ROW from the north side
Alt. 1c - where ROW expansion is required, take the additional ROW from the south side
West Alternative 2: Expand to 120’ (4-lane, open ditch drainage, no median)
Alt. 2a – take the additional ROW equally from both sides
Alt. 2b - take the additional ROW from the north side
Alt. 2c - take the additional ROW from the south side
West Alternative 3 (Alt. 1c): Expand to 110’ (4-lane, curb-and-gutter, raised median)
West Alternative 4 (Alt. 1d): Expand to 110’ (4-lane, curb-and-gutter, continuous center turn lane)
West Alternative 5 (Alt. 1e): Expand to 150’ (4-lane, open ditch drainage, raised median)
West Alternative 6 (Alt. 1f): Expand to 160’ (4-lane, open ditch drainage, continuous center turn lane)
Central Segment (through Humble-town, TX):
Existing ROW = 60’
Central Alternative 1: Keep within Existing ROW only
Central Alternative 2: Keep within Existing ROW as East-bound only and build 2nd Street to the north as West-bound.
Requires between 160 and 330’ of ROW to connect the East- and West- bound lanes together at both ends of the segment.
Central Alternative 3: Expand to approximately 100’ (to 5 lanes). Will not be chosen due to too many impacts.
East Segment:
Existing ROW = 100’
East Alternative 1: Keep project within Existing ROW only (4-lane, curb-and-gutter drainage, with Raised Median)
East Alternative 2: Keep project within Existing ROW only (4-lane, curb-and-gutter drainage, with Center Turn-Lane)

Additional ROW will be taken equally from both sides on all alternatives

Project plans provided to HRA Gray & Pape at the time of permit application
indicated that the APE includes a linear corridor, that is approximately 6.4 kilometers (4
miles) in length and ranging from 18.3 to 100.6 meters (60 to 330 feet) in width (Figure 1).

The expansion will begin at Lee Road and end at FM 1960 in the Town of Humble,
Texas. Approximately 24.4 hectares (57.9acres) of land will be encompassed by the
proposed project area.
Existing project plans indicate the 4-layer pavement will be a total of approximately
55.9 centimeters (22 inches), and that roadside drainage ditches will be approximately 60.1
centimeters (24 inches) deep at their centerline. Therefore, the APE depth in the project is
expected to be approximately 0.92 meters (3 feet) to allow for excavation and the maximum
depth of cultural resources in the project footprint. It was the understanding of HRA Gray &
Pape that at the time the fieldwork commenced, all existing right-of-way (ROW) was
controlled by TxDOT.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Site file research was conducted by James G. Foradas, Ph.D. prior to the field visit
and included reviewing records maintained by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin, Texas, as well as consultation of on-line research archives maintained by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC). Archaeologist Rebecca Sick conducted a field visit
on November 3, 2006 and Dr. Foradas and Glen Wagner tested potentially undisturbed areas
on December 13 and 15, 2006. This survey required approximately 24 person hours to
complete. Activities conducted during the field visit included visual inspection of the project
area and the preparation of field maps. Photographs were also taken of the project area. Dr.
Foradas and Rebecca F. Sick, prepared this short report. James S. Hughey was the Project
Manager and edited the report. Graphics for this report were prepared by Tony Scott, Glen
Wagner, and Julia Balakirova. Melinda Mendoza-Scott produced the report.

CHAPTER II. RESEARCH DESIGN

SITE FILE AND LITERATURE RESEARCH STRATEGY
Site file research was conducted by consulting on-line research archives maintained
by the THC. Research objectives were to identify all recorded archaeological sites within 1.6
kilometers (1 mile) of a project area and all recorded historic structures located immediately
adjacent to the project’s APE. Literature searches also produced geoscience data concerning
the environmental setting of the project area, such as soil maps and geologic maps.

FIELD METHODS
Archaeological fieldwork on the project started with a pedestrian survey of the entire
APE. During the walkover, the project area was photographed and notes were made on
copies of project plan maps and other field maps. The project area was subdivided into five
survey segments to facilitate photo documentation and field mapping.
Areas in the APE determined to be potentially undisturbed during walkover were
subjected to subsurface testing. Typically this begins with the use of 2.54-centimeter (1­
inch) Oakfield soil probes to detect areas of disturbed soil. If shovel testing appears
necessary in an undisturbed area, shovel tests are excavated within the APE to a maximum
depth of 1 meter (3 feet), or until culturally sterile subsoil is reached. All soil recovered is
screened through ¼ inch wire mesh, except clay soils which are hand sorted. No cultural
resources were detected in the APE; therefore, site delineation, laboratory analysis, and
curation methods are not discussed in this report.

CHAPTER III. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

A review of the TxDOT Houston Area PALM (Abbott 2001; see Appendix A), Soil
survey data (National Cooperative Soil Survey [NCSS] 2007; Wheeler 1976), applicable
United States Geological Survey (USGS) and State of Texas Bureau of Economic Geology
geologic maps, topographic maps, and aerial imagery (USGS 1982a-b, 1983, 1995, 2002;
Van Siclen 1991) was conducted to predict factors that might affect site visibility and
integrity during the survey of the APE.

TXDOT PALM
TxDOT’s PALM (Abbott 2001) covers Harris County and other counties in the
greater Houston area, including the area around Humble (see Appendix A). These maps are
based on a combination of data, including soil associates, landform types, cultural and natural
resource distribution, and historic and modern land use data. The PALM is a cultural
resource management tool that predicts the likelihood of detecting intact prehistoric cultural
resources in various topographic settings around Houston. The model also recommends the
type of archaeological survey stratify that should be implemented for a given PALM unit.
For PALM Unit 1, surface survey is recommended, and deep inspection is
recommended if deep impacts are anticipated. For PALM Unit 2, only surface survey is
recommended. For PALM Unit 3a, no surface survey is recommended and deep
reconnaissance is recommended only if severe impacts are anticipated. For PALM Unit 4, no
survey is recommended.

PROJECT AREA GEOMORPHOLOGY AND SOILS
Approximately 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the APE is located in PALM Unit 2. Only
surface survey is recommended for these units. A total of 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) is located
in Unit 3a; deep testing is required in these areas only if severe impacts are anticipated.
Approximately 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) of the current APE is located in PALM Unit 4; no
survey is recommended in these areas. These PALM unit boundaries were verified in the
field. No deep testing was conducted due to the nature of the soils in the project area (see
below) and the relatively shallow depth of the APE; shovel test interval and dimensions were
consistent with approved THC standards.
The project area in Harris County is underlain by Pleistocene rocks of the Lissie
Formation. These are composed of clay, silt, sand, and small inclusion of siliceous gravel.
There are also some inclusions of iron oxide and calcium carbonate (Barnes 1982; Van
Siclen 1991).
6

Vegetation in the APE consists largely of grasses and weeds, with some areas of
plantation pine and deciduous trees. In the areas between Interstate 45 and through the town
of Humble, the landscape consisted of urban land and concrete with some areas of manicured
lawn (see NCSS 2007).
Soils in the project area (NCSS 2007; Soil Survey Staff, Natural Resources
Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture [SSS NRCS USDA] 2006,
Wheeler 1976) include Bissonnet very fine sandy loam (Bn), Boy loamy fine sand (Bo),
Gessner loam (Ge), Kenny-Urban land complex (Ku), and Wockley fine sandy loam.
Bissonnet very fine sandy loam (Bn) is a nearly level soil that occurs in irregularly shaped
timbered areas with smooth boundaries. Boy loamy fine sand (Bo) is nearly level to gently
sloping in areas along low terraces of natural drainageways. Gessner loam (Ge) is a nearly
level soil in broad, irregular areas and small depressions. Kenny-Urban land complex (Ku) is
made up of nearly level to gently sloping soils along ridges and natural drainageways; it is
often found in new housing developments. Wockley find sandy loam (Wo) is nearly level
soil that is found in broad areas of forest and prairie. These are upland soils, which generally
have a low potential to produce intact deeply buried resources.
According to Abbott (2001:table 2) nearly all of these soils typically have a low
geoarchaeological potential “or likelihood that the soil could contain buried cultural material
in reasonable context” (Abbott 2001:20). Gessner loam is considered to have a lowmoderate potential for containing buried resources.
Examination of recent aerial photographs (NCSS 2007; USGS 1995, 2002; Wheeler
1976:sheets 34 and 35) of the project area indicated that all of the property within the
existing project ROW has been disturbed, largely by recent urban processes as well as natural
erosion. Disturbances visible in the aerial photographs included cement and blacktop
driveways and parking areas, drainage ditches on both sides of the street, buried and
overhead utility lines, and construction of buildings adjacent to the roadway.

CHAPTER IV. PREVIOUS CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS

A preliminary search of the THC Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) online
indicated that there were no cultural resources located in or immediately adjacent to the
project APE. However, a review of the Handbook of Texas History online indicates that
historic events and historic individuals may be associated with the project area.
The prehistoric context of the area is best understood by starting with Aten (1983)
and Patterson (1996) treatises on the prehistory of southeast Texas. Prior to colonization of
the region, it was occupied by Karankawa Indians. More recent studies indicate there were
actually five different subgroups of Karankawa Indians with the northern most tribe, called
the Cocos, living in the area of modern day Brazoria and Harris Counties. Archaeological
evidence includes shell middens and campsites (Ricklis 2004).
Historians agree that in 1528, Alvar Nunez Cabez de Vaca landed on San Luis Island
and crossed the Brazos River in order to look for provisions in the area that would become
Brazoria County. Many other Spanish explorers passed through the area like Alonso De
Leon in 1689 looking for the lost La Salle expedition and in 1727 Joaquin de Orobi y
Basterra came through looking for French intruders in the Trinity River area. In the
eighteenth century Spain started to occupy Texas in an effort to stop French and English
incursions and would often enter the area of Harris County to trade with the local Indians and
search for their lost horses (Swett Henson 2001).
The First Congress formed Harrisburg County on December 22, 1836. In December
1839, Congress changed the name to Harris County, in honor of John R. Harris. By 1853, it
had a steam mill and was the terminus for the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway,
which crossed the county to Stafford's Point to facilitate the shipment of cotton and sugar.
Five other railroads followed before the Civil War. By the 1840s, a number of German and
French settlers had immigrated to Harris County (Swett Henson 2001).
In the post-Civil War era, Harris County became more industrial. The railroads
flourished, and additional settlers made their way to the region. Various agricultural
products, including cotton, rice, and lumber were produced in Harris County, and several
small towns sprang up to the north of the City of Houston, including Tomball and Spring. In
the early 1900s, the Harris County Ship Channel Navigation District was created in order to
manage the waterways and increase shipping traffic. This area was steadily developed, and
continues to be an important resource to the county today (Swett Henson 2001).
There is one archaeological site located within a 1-kilometer (0.62-mile) radius of the
APE. This site, Site 41HR412 is a prehistoric open campsite that consists of a lithic artifact
scatter which produced a single dart-type projectile point/knife. Given the environmental and
cultural setting of the project area in relation to previously recorded resources in the region,

8

the potential to find intact archaeological resources that may be eligible for listing on the
Nation Register of Historic Places (NRHP) is low to moderate.
Given the environmental and cultural setting of the project area and the paucity of
sites recorded in the Atlas in this part of Harris County (see Abbott 2001; Aten 1983), the
potential to find intact archaeological resources that may be eligible for listing on the NRHP
is low. In addition, resources are likely to be found at shallow depths within the APE and
much of this upland region.

CHAPTER V. RESULTS OF THE CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY

The project area was subdivided into five segments (Figure 2) based on
archaeological potential, access, and the level of investigation necessary to evaluate them
given the PALM based methodology. The largest segment was the Pedestrian Survey
Segment, which was subjected to surface survey only after walkover and or windshield
survey determined urban or natural disturbances extended to APE depth.
Four other largely wooded smaller segments were defined during the initial walkover
and windshield survey as locations where subsurface testing should be considered. Two of
these, were subjected to shovel testing (Figure 3) and named for property they are situated
on. The IAH Segment was named after the international airport abbreviation for the Bush
International Airport (IAH), and the DK Segment after the initials of the owning company.
Two others segments were named No Access Segments 1 and 2, respectively after no access
was obtained to the portions of these segment lying outside the existing FM 1960 ROW.
As a result of the current survey effort, no new cultural resources were encountered in
any of these segments. Each of the survey segments examined are summarized below, and
representative photographs of the project area are shown in Plates 1 through 6.

IAH SEGMENT: FM 1960 TO LEE ROAD
Survey activities were designed to assess the potential impact that construction
processes might have on cultural resources located within the APE. As there were some
areas within this segment on the south side of the road that appeared to have intact soils. A
total of four shovel tests were attempted within this area. The most typical shovel test within
this area contained a layer of mottled clay fill underlain by compacted light brownish gray
soil that extended to a depth of 40 centimeters below surface (cmbs) (15.7 inches below
surface [inbs]).
Disturbances (Plate 1) within the IAH segment include road construction, ditching on
either side of the road, buried utility lines and water lines supplying fire hydrants. The area
also appears disturbed from airport expansion (see USGS 1995, NCSS 2007). No cultural
resources were identified within this area.

NO ACCESS SEGMENT 1: LEE ROAD TO WOODYARD ROAD
No Access Segment 1 extended from Lee Road to Woodyard Road. The proposed
road expansion would consume approximately 18.2 meters (60 feet) within this area. As the
proposed expansion in this area is narrow, the corridor was clearly visible from the existing

public road. Visual inspection beyond the existing ROW suggested the area was disturbed to
the depth of the APE. Disturbances included but are not limited to the construction of
several buildings, road construction, and road ditching.

DK SEGMENT: WOODYARD ROAD TO DUNBAR AVENUE
The DK Segment, portions of which are shown in Plates 2 and 3, extended from
Woodyard Road to Dunbar Avenue. There were some areas within this segment on the north
side of the road that appeared to have intact soils. A total of eight shovel tests were
attempted in this area; a total of four shovel tests were successfully excavated. The
remaining four shovel tests were not excavated due to the presence of a water line and other
buried utility lines capped by dirt berms that were clearly visible on the ground surface. This
area was covered with vegetation consisting of grasses, weeds, and scrub-shrub.
While the profiles of these shovel tests varied greatly, the most typical shovel test
contained four strata in profile. Stratum I extended from the ground surface to 18 cmbs (7.0
inbs) and contained a layer of dark brown sand mottled with dark gray sand. Stratum II
extended from the base of Stratum I to a depth of 26 cmbs (10.2 inbs) and contained a layer
of light gray sand. Stratum III consisted of a layer of dark brown sand that extended from 26
to 28 cmbs (10.2 to 11.0 inbs). Finally, Stratum IV extended from the base of Stratum III to
100 cmbs (39.3 inbs). No cultural resources were identified within this area.

NO ACCESS SEGMENT 2: DUNBAR AVENUE TO CARVER ROAD
No Access Segment 2 extended from Dunbar Avenue to Carver Road. The proposed
road expansion would consume approximately 18.2 meters (60 feet) within this area. As the
proposed expansion in this area is narrow, the corridor was clearly visible from the existing
public road. Visual inspection beyond the existing ROW suggested the area was disturbed
by construction of several buildings, road construction, and road ditching.

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY SEGMENT: CARVER ROAD TO FM 1960
The Pedestrian Survey Segment extends from Carver Road to where FM 1960A
meets FM 1960 to the east of the Town of Humble (Plates 4 through 6). This area was
characterized entirely by urban landscape. Disturbances in this area include urban
development, shopping centers, Interstate 45 and numerous homes and businesses. There
was limited vegetation in this area, and the dominant form of vegetation consisted of

CHAPTER VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The results of the site file review indicate that no previously identified cultural
resources are located near the proposed project area (see Figure 1). Field investigations
indicate that the proposed project will largely impact areas in and adjacent to existing ROW
that have already been greatly disturbed by previous activities involving road and drainage
ditch construction, placement of underground and overhead utility lines; and construction and
demolition of modern houses and businesses.
The results of the site file review and the evidence of severe disturbance within the
APE, indicate that no archaeological resources will be affected by the proposed project as
currently planned. HRA Gray & Pape recommends that no further archaeological survey
work be required, and that the project be permitted to proceed.
