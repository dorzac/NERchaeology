Abstract

Abstract
Archeologists from AmaTerra Environmental, Inc., working on behalf of the North Texas
Municipal Water District and their engineering and environmental subconsultant,
Freese and Nichols, Inc. conducted intensive area survey within a 539-acre tract of land
including and surrounding their proposed Leonard Water Treatment Plant (LWTP)
Terminal Storage Reservoir (TSR) west of the community of Leonard, Fannin County,
Texas. The survey was conducted for Antiquities Code of Texas compliance to assess
potential archeological resource effects of revised TSR construction plans (the main TSR
site was surveyed previously), including newly-proposed outfall pipelines. In addition,
the survey was conducted beyond the TSR-related footprint for constraints mapping and
assessment for future, currently-undefined expansion planning. A separate linear project
located within the survey tract was surveyed as part of this field effort but coordinated
separately. The data from that investigation is, however, relevant to this project and
therefore is included here. Archeologists, working under Antiquities Permit 8873
conducted surface inspection and dug 187 shovel tests through largely open, agricultural
fields with shallow, upland-variety clay soils. Backhoe trenching was not conducted due
to the shallow nature of soils confirmed through shovel testing. Eight archeological sites
(41FN269, 41FN270, 41FN273, 41FN274, 41FN275, 41FN276, 41FN277, 41FN278), all
minor historic-age farmstead remnants, trash scatters, or isolated wells, were newlyrecorded while a known late nineteenth to early twentieth-century family cemetery (the
Deel-Whitworth Cemetery) was formally recorded and assigned trinomial 41FN272.
The mapped location of site 41FN173—a twentieth-century surface-sheared well—was
revisited, but archeologists were unable to relocate it. The Deel-Whitworth Cemetery is
recommended for avoidance while additional, targeted survey is recommended if any
future projects are planned within 350 feet of the marked cemetery boundaries. This
buffer will account for a discrepancy between the marked cemetery size (<0.1 acres)
and the acre set aside for burials in deed records. None of the remaining resources are
recommended as eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The
Principal Investigator recommends that the proposed TSR project components, including
the associated outfall pipelines, will have no adverse effect on SALs and should proceed
with no further archeological resource coordination required under the ACT. Future
projects located outside of the 350-foot Deel-Whitworth Cemetery buffer are unlikely to
impact significant archeological resources and should proceed with no further fieldwork
or coordination required for Antiquities Code of Texas compliance. Though this survey
was not explicitly conducted for Section 106 compliance purposes (no federal permits,
funding, or other undertakings for the TSR are anticipated), the lack of significant cultural
resources (including non-archeological resources) within or directly adjacent to, the
survey footprint, indicates that any future federal undertakings in the immediate vicinity
will not likely result in adverse effects to Historic Properties. Future federal undertakings
should, however, be coordinated individually with reference to the potential indirect
effects of such a project and the data collected for this project. All project-generated
notes, forms, photographs, and other materials will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.

Introduction
This report summarizes the results of intensive archeological area survey conducted on
behalf of North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) in the vicinity of previouslysurveyed and coordinated facilities associated with their Leonard Water Treatment Plant
(LWTP) west of the community of Leonard in Fannin County, Texas (Figures 1–2). At
this location, NTMWD has identified 539 acres of land surrounding the LWTP’s Terminal
Storage Reservoir (TSR) that includes newly-defined TSR components as well as additional
areas that may, at some date, be required for future infrastructure though no plans are
known at this time. Archeologists surveyed 100 percent of the study area footprint,
excavating 187 shovel tests (four of which were positive for archeological artifacts) and
newly-documented eight historic-age archeological sites (41FN269, 41FN270, 41FN273,
41FN274, 41FN275, 41FN276, 41FN277, 41FN278) and one historic-age family cemetery
(41FN272). With the exception of the Deel-Whitworth Cemetery (41FN272), these sites
are minor farmstead remnants in poor condition or isolated wells or trash scatters. In
addition, archeologists revisited the mapped location of 41FN173—a largely subsurface
well shaft, but were unable to relocate it. None of these sites is recommended as eligible
for listing as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs). The Deel-Whitworth Cemetery is
recommended for avoidance in future infrastructure planning.

Description of Proposed Project

Within the 539-acre study area, NTMWD has developed a formal design for their
originally-proposed, surveyed, and coordinated TSR (Appendix A). The TSR is used
to store approximately 1,500 acre feet of water and provide a hydraulic break for the
untreated (aka. “raw”) water being pumped from existing and proposed water storage
facilities, including the soon-to-be-completed Lower Bois D’Arc Reservoir, to the LWTP
being constructed just south of the current project area. The TSR occupies an area of
approximately 67 acres and consists of two storage cells enclosed by a roughly 225-footthick earthen berm that has a maximum height of 32 feet above the ground surface. A
roughly 32-acre borrow/disposal area has been defined just north of the proposed TSR
site that will provide the fill material for the berm then house any excess excavated
material at the construction’s conclusion. Surrounding the berm, NTMWD will install a
15-foot-wide access road while various buried and above-ground utilities, fencing, and
drainage systems will also be added.

In addition to the TSR facility itself, NTMWD plans to install approximately 3,000 linear
feet of 96-inch pipeline on the west side of the TSR as an outlet line. The large-diameter
pipes will be installed using open-cut trenching to a bedding (bottom) depth of 13–23
feet below the ground surface using open-cut trenches. Three additional smallerdiameter pipelines (two 24–36-inch reclaimed and recycled water lines and one 18-inch

underseepage drain line) will parallel the outlet and also be installed through open-cut
trenching.
The pipeline corridors are located on NTMWD-owned property with a proposed 100-footwide limit of construction. The most recent design plans for the site include a roughly
370-acre fenced area within which virtually all of the construction and ground-disturbing
impacts will take place with actual impacts occupying roughly 30 percent of this area.

All other portions of the survey footprint were evaluated with no specific project planned
at this time. The investigation was requested to identify potential archeological resource
constraints that might need to be factored into future infrastructure plans, should they
eventually be required.

Regulatory Framework and Management Summary

The proposed TSR and outlet pipelines will be constructed on lands owned by NTMWD,
a political subdivision of the State of Texas, making their installation subject to the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, all field investigations within the larger 539acre survey footprint were conducted on lands and/or easements owned by NTMWD,
therefore also subject to ACT compliance. The proposed TSR will be fed in part through
a raw water pipeline that is a component of the United States Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE)-permitted Bois d’Arc Lake/Reservoir (BDL) project, but the LWTP and its TSR
would be built regardless of the BDL’s approval. The National Environmental Policy Act
Final Environmental Impact Statement and resulting Record of Decision (NEPA-FEIS/
ROD) process resulted in the conclusion that the LWTP and TSR were of independent
utility and not included in the NEPA build alternatives analysis nor were they included
in the 404 Permit issued for the BDL project (USACE 2017, 2019). In addition, TSR
construction would not impact any Waters of the US, making it not subject to separate
USACE oversight. In short, no federal review or permitting is anticipated for the TSR, its
associated outlet pipelines, or for the constraints survey. Therefore, these components
are not subject to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (Section
106). However, future projects outside of the TSR footprint described here but within
the survey footprint may require federal permitting (e.g. Clean Water Act) or funding
and therefore fieldwork was conducted in anticipation of possible future Section 106
involvement (to the extent possible with undefined, future construction components and
impacts to resources eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP;
hereafter defined as “Historic Properties”). All archeological fieldwork was conducted
under Antiquities Permit 8873. No artifacts were collected during the course of the field
survey; however, all forms, photographs, notes, and other field-generated materials will
be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin
in compliance with the requirements of Antiquities Permit 8873.

Environmental Setting
The project is located in southwestern Fannin County, which falls within the Northern
Blackland Prairie ecoregion (Omernik and Griffith 2009). The Northern Blackland Prairie
is characterized by rolling hills and flat plains underlain by limestone, chalk and shale
beds of Cretaceous age (Omernik and Griffith 2009, Stahl and McElvaney 2012). The
average annual rainfall is approximately 35–45 inches (Stahl and McElvaney 2012). The
Blackland Prairies region was historically characterized as a prairie consisting of tall
grasses, productive soils, and gentle topography, however currently much of the region is
comprised of crop land and other agriculture activities (Texas Parks and Wildlife 2018).
Lee Creek and several of its tributaries bisect the eastern portions of the survey area
and converge at an artificial pond near the southern survey boundary edge. An unnamed
tributary to Bear Creek forms most of the survey’s western boundary, crossing into the
survey area north of County Road 4955.
The Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion is dominated by mid to tall grasses such as
little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Indian
grass (Sorghastrum nutans), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper), eastern gamagrass
(Tripsacum dactyloides), and switch grass (Panicum virgatum), which are the natural
vegetative species for this environment (Omernik and Griffith 2009). In addition, pecan
(Carya illinoinensis), hackberry (Celtis laevigata), elm (Ulmus sp.), eastern cottonwood
(Populus deltoides), and bur and Shumard oak (Quercus macrocarpa and shumardii) are
often observed within the low flat woodlands along streams located within the Northern
Blackland Prairie. Since the nineteenth century, human land modifications along with
ranching/grazing activities have resulted in a dramatic increase in other flora species
(e.g., mesquite, ash juniper and eastern red cedar; Stahl and McElvaney 2012). Today the
area is associated most strongly with cropland (Frye et al. 1984).

According to Collins (1995), the region is geographically characterized as an area of low
topographic relief and poor drainage that is prone to frequent flooding, conditions that
were prevalent at the time of the current survey (see Chapter 5). Archeologists observed
fallow and active croplands throughout the survey corridor and very little topographic
relief. Standing water observed particularly within the western half of the survey corridor
was a testament to the dense, sticky clays and poor drainage of the area.
Richard B. Thomas, who owned one of the parcels on which the current cultural resource
survey took place, wrote a series of letters between 1852 and 1853 shortly after emigrating
to the area that have been transcribed on the Fannin County Historic Commission’s
website (FCHC 2019). The letters enthusiastically describe the landscape, vegetation,
crops, and wildlife of the area. In a letter dated August 8, 1852, that he wrote from nearby
Bonham, Richard Thomas boasted of beautiful lands and abundant water in the area.
Included among the animals he reported were “...bear, panther, wolves, wild horses, foxes,

and [a] number of Prairie chickens and turkeys.” He would go on to say, “We have far the
best crops of corn this year… Wheat and oats very good and sweetpotatoes [sic]… grow so
large that a person can sit on one end and roast the other with convenience…”

Soils and Geology

The proposed survey area is centered along the north/south-trending Lee Creek just
south of the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas (MKT) Railroad where it meets US Highway 69,
while the Bear Creek headwaters follows most of the survey’s western edge. According
to the Geologic Atlas of Texas (USGS 2018), the entire project footprint overlies LateCretaceous-era Gober Chalk and Roxton Limestone (Kgc) geology (Figure 3). Recorded
soils (USDA-NCSS 2018) primarily consist of a broad sheet of ancient, dense, upland
clays derived from chalk residuum including Fairlie-Dalco (FdB), Fairlie (FaA), HoweWhitewright (HwC), Whitewright-Howe (WwD2) varieties (Figure 4). Each of these
soils consists of a shallow (generally 20–50 centimeters) Holocene zone overlying dense
subsoils. Pockets of shallow, Stephen silty clays (ShB) are located on high points in the
project’s southeastern region while a band of Tinn clay (Tc) follows the Lee Creek channel
and tributary lowlands that bisect the survey.
Waterways (such as Lee Creek) typically correspond with deeper Holocene soils generated
from erosion in the channels’ upper limits that is carried downstream and re-deposited
in floodplains. Topographic maps indicate that all of the currently-described project and
survey components correspond with erosional headwaters reaches of Lee Creek and
its tributaries and Bear Creek’s tributary and not any potential floodplains that may lie
farther to the south. Archeological survey confirmed that all of the soils in the channel
vicinities were in situ with sterile clays accessible through shovel testing alone (Figure 5).

Survey Area Natural Conditions Observed

The primarily agricultural nature of the survey area was clear at the time of the field
investigations with archeologists observing broad, open cropland on generally flat to
slightly-rolling terrain throughout. Creeks and tributaries typically incised into the
flat terrain while an artificial dam across Lee Creek produced a pond that was the only
significant water feature observed. Some of the fields were fallow with thick carpets of
knee-high grasses while others were still active, with crops harvested shortly before the
field survey (Figures 6–7). As stated above, poor drainage from dense clays resulted in
large portions of the project area containing standing water. In areas toward the southeast,
the vegetation was composed of shorter, pasture-type grasses which grew on more varied
terrain (though still not dramatically so; Figure 8). Along the property boundaries and
the waterway cuts, riparian zones were populated with various old-growth hardwoods
and ash-juniper along with various vines and scrub (Figure 9). The previously-surveyed
and coordinated components of the Bois D’Arc Lake Project were under construction at
the time of survey with a virtual city of construction vehicles, access roads, workers, and
administrative buildings occupying a large area immediately south of the current survey
footprint (Figure 10).

Cultural Background
Prehistoric Cultural Background
The project area is situated within the North-Central Texas Archeological Region
(Perttula 2004:7). Although still poorly understood because of the lack of excavations
conducted on well stratified and intact archeological sites within the region, there
are three periods that have most succinctly been defined by Dan Prikryl (1990) in his
synthesis of geomorphology and archeology along the Elm Fork of the Trinity River. They
are the Paleoindian period, the Archaic, and the Late Prehistoric, described in further
detail below.

Paleoindian Period

The first undisputed evidence of human habitation in North America is known as the
Paleoindian period and dates from 11,500–8000 BP in north-central Texas and the
Southern Great Plains (Prikryl 1990; Hofman 1989:29–45; Story 1990). Similarly, the
Paleoindian period dates from 11,500–8500 BP in central Texas (Collins 1995) where a
higher number of well-stratified sites have been recorded. The close of the Pleistocene
period is characterized by small bands of nomadic big game hunters with a lithic
technology consisting of Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Scottsbluff, Golondrina, and Plainview
projectile points (Black 1989). Several sites dating to the Paleoindian Period are found
throughout north-central Texas. One of the oldest Paleoindian sites in this region is
arguably the Aubrey Clovis Site (41DN479), located in Denton County, Texas. The Aubrey
Clovis Site has been carbon dated to 11,550 BP (Ferring 2001). A wide variety of lithic
material, which originated in distant locations, was found at 41DN479 under roughly
eight meters of alluvium on the Elm Fork floodplain.

Archaic

The Archaic Period immediately follows the Paleoindian Period and is typically divided
into the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic subperiods. Generally, the Archaic Period is
characterized by a more intensive reliance on local floral and faunal resources. The
Archaic period in north-central Texas is tentatively dated between 8500–2700 BP
(Prikryl 1990). The Archaic period saw an increase in the number of projectile point
styles (Collins 1995). The archeological record also suggests a heavier reliance on food
processing and a wider variety of site functions, as well as more localized geographic
distributions of artifacts. Increasingly complex settlement systems, increased population
sizes, gradually decreasing mobility, and development of distinct group territories define
the Archaic period in north-central Texas (Prikryl 1990). These circumstances may have
compelled Archaic populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of north central

Texas to diversify hunting and gathering strategies based on bottomland resources of the
rivers and tributaries, and bison hunting along the plains (Hofman 1989). Archeological
endeavors along the West Fork of the Trinity River suggest that primary contexts for Early
and Middle Archaic sites are likely to be identified only under deeply buried deposits of
floodplain alluvium (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986).
Early Archaic

Prikryl (1990) dates the Early Archaic from approximately 8500–6000 BP and suggests
a lack of regional differences in terms of adaptive patterns during this time. In the North
Texas region, subsistence data during the Early Archaic is scarce (Ferring and Yates 1997)
and of high integrity. Early Archaic projectile point styles in north-central Texas included
early split-stemmed varieties and possibly Angostura (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990). The
dwindling megafauna populations led to a shift in focus from large game to smaller game
such as deer, fish, and plant material (Black 1989).
Middle Archaic

The Middle archaic dates roughly from around 6000–3500 BP and the climate shift to a
warmer drier climate that began in the Early Archaic continued to persist into the Middle
Archaic, although as the Middle Archaic continued conditions became more mesic (Albert
and Wyckoff 1984), leading to the development of the Cross Timbers physiographic
region (Prikryl 1990). Prikryl’s (1990) research into the archeological data from the
lower Elm Fork of the Trinity River reveals that all Middle Archaic sites recorded prior to
1990 were situated on the first terrace above stream flood plains, with 55 percent along
the Elm Fork itself. This settlement pattern suggests that Middle Archaic peoples utilized
terraces along major drainages. Additionally, Prikryl’s studies revealed a complete lack
of burned rock middens in the lower Elm Fork region. Projectile points commonly found
in the lower Elm Fork region include Carrollton, Wells, and the Basal-Notched group that
includes Calf Creek, Bell, and Andice points (Prikryl 1990). The climate may have been
drier, and that the homogeneity of artifact types with adjacent regions might indicate that
Middle Archaic groups participated in broader cultural interactions (Ferring and Yates
1997:305).
Late Archaic

Prikryl places the Late Archaic period from 3500–1250 BP and observes at least three
increases in site frequency relative to the Middle Archaic period (1990). The Late Archaic
in the north central Texas region is characterized by an increase in the number of sites, a
greater distribution of sites over the landscape, and decreased mobility (Prikryl 1990).
Ferring (1986) suggests that the climate during the Late Archaic was even more mesic
than in the previous Early and Middle Archaic periods. It has also been hypothesized
that population densities increased dramatically during the Late Archaic, possibly due to
changing environmental conditions, new subsistence strategies, technological innovations,
reduced group mobility, or the increased accumulation of cultural knowledge. However,
as groups began to specialize in the procurement of resources available, mobility and
14

cultural interactions with neighboring groups may have decreased. This may be indicated
in the more diverse tool technologies and subsistence patterns. Projectile point style
varieties show an increase. Projectile points characterizing a Late Archaic component
include Ellis, Ensor, Palmillas, Yarbrough, Kent, and Gary points. Other styles include
Castroville, Elam, Dallas, Edgewood, Godley, Marshall, and Trinity points (Prikryl 1990;
Story 1990).
The lithic material used for tool manufacture in the Late Archaic suggests a decrease
in group mobility as compared to earlier periods (Skinner 1981; Prewitt 1983). Prikryl
(1990) found that 62 percent of the projectile points found within his area of study
(the Lower Elm Fork) were made from materials obtained locally, specifically Ogallala
quartzite. Smaller game and plant materials continued to be an important component
to Late Archaic subsistence strategies (Brownlow et al. 1999). Late Archaic deposits
along the Denton Creek drainage indicate an increased reliance on freshwater shellfish,
suggesting a possible decreased availability of large game, decreasing territory size, or
resource specialization (Anthony and Brown 1994).

Late Prehistoric

The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin falls roughly
between 1300–250 BP. Research at Lake Ray Roberts suggests that regional exchange
of technological information, rather than environmental change, likely explains the
shift from Late Archaic lifeways to Late Prehistoric (Ferring and Yates 1997:305). Both
Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) agree on the division of the Late Prehistoric into an
early and late phase based on arrow point and ceramic technologies. The early phase
dates from 1300–800 BP and reflects a continuation of the foraging subsistence system
of the preceding Late Archaic. Assemblages are characterized by sand and grog tempered
ceramics and by Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba arrow points (Lynott 1977;
Prikryl 1990). The introduction of the bow and arrow enabled prehistoric hunters to
harvest prey from greater distances more safely, and required less room to maneuver
than atlatls so hunters could conceal themselves in brush. Similarly to other temporal
periods, known sites appear to have occurred on terraces, although roughly one-third
are known to be situated on the floodplain. The climate is also believed to have become
drier around 1000 BP (Prikryl 1990). Climate stress and the presence of ecotones may
have contributed to the large numbers of sites located on the Cross-Timbers/Blackland
Prairie boundary. Prikryl argues that the regionalization observed during the early phase
of the Late Prehistoric shifts to one of greater mobility or trade with neighboring groups
(Prikryl 1990).

The late phase reflects Southern Plains influences and occurred from 750–250 BP
(Prikryl 1990). It is associated with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the
Henrietta focus, unstemmed triangular points (Fresno, Maud, Washita, and Harrell), and
the Perdiz point (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990). This period also exhibits some evidence
of horticulture and bison procurement. As bison herd sizes increased, hunter gatherers
became more reliant on them for subsistence (Baugh 1986; Prewitt 1981; Suhm 1957;
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

15

Archeological Survey for North Texas Municipal Water District’s Proposed Leonard Water Treatment Plant
Terminal Storage Reservoir and Future Infrastructure Constraints Planning, Leonard, Fannin County, Texas

Yates 1982). In north-central Texas, this phase demonstrates prominent influence from
settled agricultural peoples to the north and east. House structures, roasting pits, Alba
points, burned corn, and grog-tempered ceramics were documented at sites in the region
indicating significant adaptive transitions during the middle of the Late Prehistoric period
(Peter and McGregor 1988).

Historic Background

Europeans entered Texas starting around AD 1528, but visited only sporadically, and did
not settle there until around AD 1700 (Webb 1952). In response to the continuous threat
of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well as the French incursion into East Texas, the
Spaniards erected a series of missions and presidios in Texas during the eighteenth century.
Eventually, the newly independent Mexican government began granting impresario
contracts to allow more prominent Anglo settlement to facilitate development. Stephen
F. Austin, one such settler, eventually spearheaded a movement by Anglo and Mexican
settlers against Mexican authority and towards independence.
Anglo-American settlers first came to present-day Fannin County in the mid 1830s to
lay claim to land grants offered by the Mexican—and later the Texas—government. Two
colonies were formed in these early years: one on the Red River and another on Bois d’
Arc Creek near what would become Bonham (Pigott 2019). In December 1837, Fannin
County was formed by the Texas legislature, though its present-day boundaries were not
drawn until 1846. Early settlers often clashed with local Native Americans. Continuous
Indian raids in the late 1830s and early 1840s forced many settlers into or nearby one of
three protective forts in the county: Fort Warren, Fort Inglish, and Fort Lyday (Strickland
1930). The Treaty of Bird’s Fort, signed in 1846 largely ended hostilities (Pigott 2019).
In the decades leading up to the Civil War, Fannin County remained relatively sparsely
populated, reaching a population of 9,217 by 1860. The local economy relied on agriculture,
particularly cattle, corn, and cotton (Pigott 2019). Fannin County grew quickly from the
end of the Civil War to the beginning of the twentieth century. Immigration from other
states (particularly southern states), increased during this time, especially after the first
railroad was built in Fannin County in 1873. This was the Transcontinental division of
the Texas and Pacific Railroad that extended from Texarkana west to Fort Worth (Hymer
2019).

The current project is located in southwestern Fannin County, which was sparsely
populated until the late nineteenth century. This area was historically surrounded by
Wildcat Thicket to the south and Bois d’ Arc Thicket to the north, which made the prairie
between difficult to access. Moreover, the thickets attracted fugitives and outlaws (Hymer
2010). The railroad’s arrival in southwestern Fannin County in the 1870s and 1880s
made it much more accessible and attractive to settlers. Construction on the Denison and
Southeastern Railroad began in 1877 in Denison and reached its terminus in Mineola
in 1880 (Hymer 2019). This passenger rail line, which was sold to the MKT Railroad in
1889, became southwest Fannin County’s connection to larger Texas cities and to the rest
of the country.

Chapter 3

The town of Leonard, which lies approximately one mile east of the project area, was
founded in 1880 to be a stop on the new Denison and Southeastern Railroad. The heirs
of Solomon L. Leonard, who owned the property where the town was to be located,
negotiated with the railroad to auction off part of their land as town lots. The auction
took place at the newly established town square on July 22; within a week Mark Daniels
opened the first business in Leonard, a saloon (Hymer 1986). By 1885 the town had 350
residents and a number of thriving businesses and social institutions, including nine
stores, three blacksmiths, two hotels, two doctors, two lawyers, a gin, a school, and a
church (Hymer 2010). The town’s first newspaper, the Leonard Graphic was established
in 1890 and continues to publish on a weekly basis today (LPL 2005).

By the turn of the twentieth century, Leonard had grown to around 1,000 people and
included several businesses, churches, and even a small college that operated from 18941914 (Figure 11). Throughout the twentieth century the economy remained centered
around agriculture, especially cotton. By the mid 1970s, however, cotton crops began
to fail and by the late 1980s wheat, grain, sorghum, and cattle ranching had become
the mainstays of local economy (Hymer 2010). The author (Miller) remembers his
grandfather, a Leonard resident in life, harvesting such crops with a combine in many
fields surrounding the community and off loading the yield at grain elevators in town in
the mid-1980s.

In the summer of 1875, Elders S. Marshal, N.A. Rogers, and T.P. Reece organized the
Thomas Glade Church, the first Baptist church in the vicinity, approximately one mile west
of Leonard within the Thomas Glade School House. By 1882 the church and the school
house building were moved into the new town of Leonard, becoming the community’s
first school (LPL 2005:33). According to a map included in The History of Leonard, Texas
Volume II (LPL 2005:rear inside cover), the original school house site was located roughly
opposite the MKT railroad from the current project’s eastern boundary between the
rail line and present-day US 69 (roughly in the vicinity of the “Yahweh Street” label on
Figure 1). A review of aerial photographs and maps going back to 1936 did not result in
identifying any references to the church or the school in this location, therefore it is unclear
if this was located elsewhere. A mid-to-late twentieth-century housing development now
occupies the depicted church and school site and no remnants of such an occupation
were observed within the survey corridor.

Previously Recorded Cultural Resource Information

According to the Texas Historical Commission’s Online Sites Atlas (Atlas 2018), no
National Register-listed properties or districts, Official Texas Historical Markers
(OTHMs), or historic-age cemeteries are located within 500 meters of the current survey
footprint (Figure 12). A recorded historic-age cemetery and two markers are, however,
located in the western outskirts of Leonard, 1,000 meters from the project area. Atlas
records indicate that archeologists from AR Consultants surveyed a large area in the
immediate vicinity of the currently-proposed survey in 2014 for the main Lower Bois
D’Arc Creek Reservoir and Pipeline Project (Antiquities Permit 6626). This survey also
included evaluating the original raw water pipeline corridor leading to the TSR, from
the east. In addition, the Atlas depicts a 1976 survey on behalf of the Soil Conservation
Service along the lowlands surrounding Lee Creek, while two isolated area surveys were
also conducted on behalf of the SCS to the southeast in 1984. Finally, one segment of a
1982 EPA/Texas Department of Water Resources survey extends northeast of the project
footprint toward US 69, while the remaining two segments skirt the eastern edge of a
1,000-meter project buffer. AmaTerra archeologists investigated an unrelated linear
project that was co-located within the current area survey during fieldwork for this
project under Antiquties Permit 8683.

Four archeological sites were recorded in the currently-proposed project vicinity (1,000 m)
during the 2014 AR Consultants investigation (41FN172-41FN175; see Figure 12). Each
of the sites is historic-aged with no prehistoric components with most composed of
surface scatters of equipment and minimal historic-age artifacts, cisterns, and outbuilding
remnants typical of late nineteenth to early twentieth century farmsteads. All of the sites
were recommended as Not Eligible for listing as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or
on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

Historic-Age Map and Aerial Imagery Interpretation
All of the previously-recorded archeological sites within 500 meters of the project area
are historic-age and additional historic-age resources were considered probable prior
to survey. A 1936 Fannin County Highway Map does depict several structures within the
survey footprint, particularly along the county road frontages on the survey’s eastern
side (Figure 13). Early 1960s USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangles depict a survey
footprint that is largely devoid of structures, with the exception of two possible buildings
south of an unnamed road immediately south of County Road 4960 (Figure 14). A 1964
aerial photograph depicts the mapped structures as two likely farmstead complexes while
two possible minor outbuildings stand near the project’s southeast corner (Figure 15). In
addition, several off-channel tanks/ponds visible on the aerial photo and maps may still
be extant and therefore would be of historic-age. All of the distinct indications of historicage occupations are limited to the eastern half of the project area. Of particular note,
one structural complex north of CR 4960 appeared to potentially be of historic age from
modern aerial photography. The complex, a mobile home and surrounding outbuildings
(see Chapter 5), was investigated during the current survey but was found through postfield aerial photograph review to have been brought to the area some time after 1996
(Figure 16).

Field Methods
Archeological field investigations generally followed the prescribed minimum standards
for 100 percent intensive area survey.

Archeological Pedestrian Survey Methodology

The overwhelming majority of the survey area was evaluated in accordance with the
Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA’s) minimum standards for 100 percent intensive
survey of area projects of 200 acres or more. This includes surface inspection supplemented
with subsurface shovel testing at a rate of approximately one test per three acres, or 180
tests for this 539-acre project. Subsurface tests were excavated at opportunistic locations
throughout the survey tract but a portion specifically targeted the outfall lines located
in the western half of the project. In addition, as stated previously, a separate project
is co-located within the current survey tract, generally paralleling the Missouri-KansasTexas Railroad then turning west, south of County Road 4960 to its intersection with
County Road 4965. This component was surveyed following the CTA’s guidelines for
100 percent intensive linear projects (16 tests per mile per 100-foot of impact width)
during the area survey. Data from these tests are relevant to the larger area survey and
are therefore included in this report as well.

Shovel test frequency was increased or decreased depending on field conditions,
archeological probability, and evidence of previous disturbance. For instance, additional
tests were placed on either terrace of Lee Creek to assess floodplain potential. Each shovel
test was excavated by hand in roughly 20-centimeter levels to: 1) the predetermined
maximum depth of 80 centimeters, 2) to clearly visible, sterile subsoil or bedrock, or 3) to
evidence of disturbance; whichever was reached first. Soils were screened through ¼-inch
hardware cloth whenever possible, though recent heavy rains coupled with dense sticky
clays dictated that most soils were hand-sorted instead (Figures 17–18). Non-site shovel
test locations and observations were recorded on standardized logs and mapped using
handheld GPS units. Each test record included observations for topographic location, soil
stratigraphy, evidence of disturbance, and any artifacts observed. Once recording was
complete, each test was immediately backfilled.
Pedestrian survey confirmed the preliminary background research indications that
backhoe trenching was not warranted with all shovel tests adjacent to waterways reaching
sterile subsoil clays. Accordingly, backhoe trenching was not conducted.

‘chased’ outward beyond
the survey boundary. Locational information (features, fencelines, shovel tests, etc.) were
recorded within sites using a combination of compass and pace, hand-drawn maps and
the hand-held GPS units.
In accordance with the accepted research design, no artifacts were collected during field
survey. When observed, all artifacts (or a representative sample thereof) were recorded
through field notes, drawings, and/or photographs then returned to their find location.
Historic-age sites were further investigated through archival research and historic aerial
photograph overlays.

SAL Evaluation Criteria
The ACT allows for archeological resources to be evaluated for significance at the
state level as SALs. According to the ACT, any site located on state-owned land may be
considered a SAL if it meets any of the formal designation criteria (13 Texas Antiquities
Code [TAC] 26.8):
•

the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;

•

the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;

•

•
•

the site’s archeological deposits and artifacts within the state are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;

the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur
and official landmark designation is needed to insure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism
and relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

Laboratory

All artifacts observed in the field were recorded on site and returned to their find location.
All field-generated forms, notes, photographs, and other materials were organized and
curated at TARL in Austin.

In accordance with the accepted research design, no artifacts were collected during field
survey. When observed, all artifacts (or a representative sample thereof) were recorded
through field notes, drawings, and/or photographs then returned to their find location.
Historic-age sites recorded during the survey were further investigated through archival
research and historic aerial photograph overlays.

Results Of Investigations
During the course of seven days of field survey, archeologists surveyed the entirety of the
project area, excavating 187 shovel tests (183 negative and four positive) and documented
eight historic-age archeological resources (Sites 41FN269, 41FN270, 41FN273, 41FN274,
41FN275, 41FN276, 41FN277, and 41FN278, including the Deel-Whitworth Cemetery
(41FN272; Figures 19 and 20)). Information about FS-6 and a currently occupied
residence was recorded in the field, but the structures were determined to be of modern
construction and neither was assigned a trinomial. A general summary of the intensive
area survey is presented below.

The survey area was divided into three parts: 1) Western; 2) Northeastern; and 3)
Southeastern. The Western survey area includes two adjacent blocks of open, managed
hayfields, totalling 136.2 acres on the west side of CR 4965. Previously recorded site
41FN173 is within Survey Segment 1. Three new sites (41FN273, 41FN274, and 41FN276)
were recorded and 63 shovel tests were excavated in Survey Segment 1. The Northeastern
Survey Segment 2 is 152 acres of unmanaged high grasses in active agricultural fields
with minimal topographic variation on the east side of CR 4965 that was investigated
using 87 shovel tests, recording four sites (41FN269, 41FN270, 41FN275, and 41FN277).
The Southeastern Survey Segment 3 is 251.3 acres, including about 40 acres of water
with more rolling terrain and short grasses. It was investigated using 33 shovel tests,
recording 41FN278 and the Deel-Whitworth Cemetery.

Archeological Survey

Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
A total of 187 shovel tests was placed within the overall survey area, all but four of which
were negative for cultural resources (Appendix B; see Figures 19 and 20). A positive
shovel test was encountered at each of sites 41FN270 (JB13) and 41FN273 (WP6), while
two positive shovel tests (MG10 and MG12) were excavated at site FS5. Soils within the
survey area were generally clay or clay loam. Shovel tests were strategically placed within
the survey area and ranged in depth from 7 to 80 cmbs, averaging 34.3 cmbs. The color
and texture of the soil was generally very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay or clay
loam overlying brown (10YR 4/3) or dark gray (10YR 4/1) basal clay subsoil or decaying
limestone bedrock, with the calcium carbonate content of the soils tending to increase
with depth. The water table was shallow and was encountered in some excavations; much
of the survey area was saturated from periodic rains before and during the of survey. .

The survey area was mainly comprised of open agricultural fields and pasture (Figure 21),
with riparian vegetation associated with stock ponds, Lee Creek, the unnamed upland
headwater tributaries of Bear Creek, and fence lines. Four currently occupied (or recently
abandoned) residential complexes were also within the survey area, and about 1,488
meters (4,879 feet) of the survey area (at its northwestern and northeastern corners) are
adjacent to the MKT Railroad. The terrain throughout is mainly level with slopes ranging
from zero to three percent, although Lee Creek is deeply incised (about 3.5 meters [11.5
feet]; Figure 22). Ground surface visibility ranged from about 90 percent in the recently
cut cotton field to nearly zero in grassy pastures or fallow agricultural fields (Figure 23).
The prefabricated residence, barn, and outbuildings on the north side of CR 4960 were
investigated as FS6, but were not recorded as an archeological resource based on a postfield review of aerial photography that determined they were constructed or moved here
some time after 1996 (Figure 24). The barn and carport initially appeared older because
they were clad using repurposed corrugated tin (multiple rows of old nail holes were
visible upon closer inspection). Similarly, a currently occupied residential area at the
intersection of the MKT Railroad and CR 4965 (opposite site 41FN172) was determined
to be of modern construction (2005-2006), and was not assigned a temporary site name
or trinomial.

Site 41FN173 Revisit
Archeologists revisited the mapped location of Site 41FN173, a small well/cistern that
Davis et al. (2016) documented during AR Consultants’ survey of Lower Bois D’Arc Creek
Reservoir, its raw water pipeline, the proposed LWTP, and the then-defined boundary of
its TSR. The site was noted as a single well/cistern that had been scraped away to just
below the ground surface with only a single green lath depicting its location. The initial
recorders observed that the site was in poor condition and recommended 41FN173 was
ineligible for listing as a SAL. The current survey’s crew revisited the site area but were
unable to relocate the feature due to vegetation growth and the green lath no longer
being visible (Figure 25). It is presumed that if the site is still extant, it is buried beneath
the ground surface but it is highly unlikely that the site contains previously-unrecorded,
significant components and therefore no change in significance or resource management
recommendations is warranted.

Site 41FN269
Site 41FN269 is a historic-age (early-to-mid-twentieth century) farmstead remnant
measuring approximately 65 x 60 meters (north-south by east-west; 197 x 213 feet;
Figure 26). Site 41FN269 is situated east of, and adjacent to, the open and active agricultural
field within a wooded area with numerous saplings and a few mature deciduous trees in
Survey Segment 2. The remnants of a machine-made-brick-lined well (Figures 27–28)
and a wooden pole barn (Figure 29) were the only features observed, while a surface
scatter of burned household and farm refuse (landscaping timbers, rubber tires, modern
glass bottles, a flattened metal lubricant barrel, etc.)—a likely former burn pile—was
located adjacent to the barn (Figure 30). One double-rolled, unsoldered, sanitary food
can was the only clearly temporal diagnostic observed (Figure 31). According to a historic
can typology developed by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
(2019), this type of can dates from 1904-present.

The well, although damaged, has 14 visible courses of unmarked red brick (4 x 8 x 3-inch)
rising approximately three feet above the ground surface. The well is approximately 32
inches in diameter and extends to an unknown depth (it was full of water at the time
of survey). Additional red-paste bricks with no maker’s marks were scattered on the
surface around the well and were consistent with those comprising the intact portions of
the well. The pole barn stands approximately 30 meters to the southwest and measures
approximately 15 x 30 feet and 10 feet tall. It was constructed of modern milled lumber
and clad with corrugated tin. It had a wide door (about 2.5 meters [8 feet]), and may
have been used as an equipment shed. Additional structures were depicted within the
site boundary in a 1964 aerial photograph (Figure 32), but none of those structures is
extant. Six shovel tests were excavated to delineate the site (Table 1). All were negative
for cultural material. Besides modern trash, no diagnostic historic-age artifacts were
encountered on the surface of the site, much of which was covered by tall grass, leaf litter,
or duff, affording little visibility.
41FN269 Archival Summary

Deed research suggests that the property containing Site 41FN269 is associated with the
Key and Thomas families. In 1847 William H. Hunt and John D. Black received a land
patent from the State of Texas for 640 acres that included the land within 41FN269. Hunt
and Black owned a land company with vast holdings throughout Texas and it is unlikely
that either lived on or even saw the property. In 1852 Richard B. Thomas purchased 640
acres from Hunt and Black (Fannin County deed records F/149). It is likely that Thomas
and his family lived on the property. U.S. Census records indicate that the nearest post
office to the family home in 1860 was Oak Hill, which was located in Grove Hill (Hymer
1986), four miles northeast of 41FN269. In 1861, Richard B. Thomas sold 150 acres of
the property to the duplicately-named Thomas Thomas, who was probably his brother
(1870 U.S. Census; Fannin County deed records N/428). In 1894 Thomas and his wife,
Mary Ann, deeded 35 (?; specific number was difficult to read on the document) acres to
their son J. R. (Fannin County deed records 54/411).

J. R. Thomas and his wife, Jesse, owned the land until 1916 when they sold 49 acres that
includes the location of 41FN269 to John T. Key (Fannin County deed records 139/705).
John Key owned and probably lived on this property until his death in 1958 (LPL
2005:155). As part of the settlement of John Key’s estate, his son, Thomas, purchased
the 49 acres (Fannin County deed records 417/538). Thomas Key died in 1966, and his
widow deeded the property to their three children: Billy J., Thomas W., and Lowell G. Key
(Fannin County deed records 488/683). According to Thomas Key’s obituary, he had been
living in Fort Worth for a few years, as did two of his children (findagrave.com 2019). Billy
J. Key still owns the property today but does not live there.

Based on deed records, census data, and the early-to-mid-twentieth-century age of most
of the structures and artifacts at the site, 41FN269 is probably most closely associated
with John T. Key and his immediate family.

Summary
Overall, 41FN269 is an early-to-mid-twentieth-century archeological site centered around
a brick-lined well with an associated wooden barn/shed. No significant historic-age
diagnostic artifacts were encountered in any shovel test or on the surface besides a metal
can whose form has been in use for more than 100 years. Push piles of modern household
and farm refuse are indicative of the disturbances associated with the demolition of
the former structures. The well may date to the early twentieth century, but it is not a
particularly unique feature and was associated with a former historic-age residence and
outbuildings that have since been almost entirely removed. Thus, the integrity of the
well’s context has been permanently altered and further investigation would not likely
result in additional new information important to the history of Texas. The barn itself has
no known association with important historic events, trends, or persons and is a common
building type.
Finally, archival research suggests that the site is most likely attributed to John T. Key and
his descendants, who have owned the property from 1916 to the present. The 1936 Fannin
County Highway map depicts two structures in the general vicinity of Sites 41FN269 and
41FN270, the westernmost being 41FN269 (see Figure 13). Accordingly, the earliest
components of 41FN269 date at least as early as the Great Depression, a period when
the land was owned by John Key. While remarkable that the property has been owned by
one family (Richard B. Thomas) for 64 years followed by the current owner’s family for
the past 103 years, neither family was known to be associated with an important historic
event, person, or property.
The former residence has been demolished or removed, negatively affecting the integrity
of the remaining features (well and barn) because the site’s context has been permanently
altered. The barn and well lack research potential or association with individuals of
historical significance. Site 41FN269 is recommended as not eligible for designation as
an SAL. No further work is recommended at this site.

Site 41FN270
Site 41FN270 consists of a historic-age storm shelter, two barns, cow pens, animal troughs,
an animal shed, a functioning pump and well, a capped well, an area of burning associated
with a former structure’s footprint and surficial scatter of modern and historic-age artifacts.
No substantial complement of artifacts was associated with this functioning, historic-age
ranching complex on a terrace west of Lee Creek in Survey Segment 2 (Figure 33). The
site, whose boundaries were defined by various fence lines that encompass the site’s
features, measures approximately 155 x 170 meters (north-south by east-west; 509 x 558
feet) and is adjacent to (east) 41FN269. Three features are situated within the northern
portion of the site along CR 4960, including a semi-subterranean storm shelter (Figures
34, 35, and 36), a modern milled-lumber and plywood animal shed and adjacent light
pole (Figure 37), and an approximately 70-foot-long series of concrete animal troughs in
two-foot-wide semi-circle segments (Figure 38).
All other features are within the southern portion of the site, including a well that is
located near the site’s southern boundary (Figure 39). It was constructed of bricks
and measured 36 inches in diameter and was 30 inches tall with remnants of a cement
coating on its exterior. The cap, although much smaller, was similar to the well cap at
site 41FN275. The well’s location at the edge of a saturated swale with water pooled and
seeping around it was much the same as at both sites 41FN274 and 41FN275. A pump
was installed in association with the well at 41FN270, and a particle-board shed had been
built around it. A modern galvanized tub, presumably a cattle watering trough, was next
to the well, but on the opposite side of the fence.
The semi-subterranean storm shelter was made of formed concrete with only the opening
to a set of stairs, about two feet of the walls, and a flat roof with vent pipes visible above
ground. Below ground, the room had a set of shelves to one side that had canned goods
and other items stored on them.

A relatively common feature on the surrounding landscape, the semi-subterranean shelter
was probably constructed in the 1950s or 1960s and associated with the presumed
residence near CR 4960 depicted in a 1964 aerial photo (Figure 40), but that has since
been demolished or removed. Recent aerial photographs depict these same structures
(see Figure 33), indicating that they were removed within the last few years.
The 1964 aerial photo also documents several outbuildings associated with the residence,
but none of these structures is extant (see Figure 40). Conversely, the main barn, a side
barn, and a cow pen (Figure 41) associated with them in the 1964 aerial photo remain
standing to the south.
Of note: the plywood animal shed west of the storm shelter is not depicted on this image,
suggesting it was added after that date. A total of 10 shovel tests (Table 2) were excavated
to delineate the site, including one positive shovel test (JB13), and nine negative ones
(BB10, BB11, BB12, JB14, RB11, MG7, MM3, SP13, and SP14. JB13 contained architectural/
construction debris (nail, windowglass, etc.) and clear bottle glass and undecorated
whiteware sherds in the upper 30 centimeters of sediments. Negative tests contained
shallow, upland clays with minimal deposition and no subsurface artifacts.

A concrete cap on a former well was noted nearby during the survey. A highly fragmented
scatter of modern and historic-age artifacts was encountered on the surface. The historicage artifacts (some melted) consisted of plain whiteware, gilded-rim whiteware, and
embossed whiteware sherds, milk glass and cobalt-colored shards, brown-glazed ceramic
insulators, and a light green glass marble (Figure 42). The artifact scatter was mostly
visible on the scraped ground where a structure formerly stood, but also extended into
grassy areas nearby. The footprint of a former structure was discernible as an area of
burned earth.

observed on the ground surface within Site 41FN270.

Site 41FN270 Archival Summary
Deed research revealed a lengthy and complex chain of title for the property on which
41FN270 is located. It was first part of a 640-acre tract patented to the above-referenced
William Hunt and John Black in 1852. Since then the property, or parts of it, have been
bought and sold over two dozen times. In 1921 Byron Benjamin Braly purchased a 57-acre
tract that includes the site from G. P. Rhodes and his wife (Fannin County deed records
158/83). Through Ethel Braly Arnold (Figure 43), daughter of Byron Braly, a portion of
the property stayed in the family until 1949 when Ethel Arnold sold the land (one of six
tracts sold) to Weldon Jaco (Fannin County deed records 304/525–526).
Ten years later, Weldon and his wife, Carol Jaco, sold the property, along with six other
parcels, to C. E. Gray. Gray sold the same seven parcels along with the the 57-acre Site
41FN270 property to Ben Smithson and his wife in 1963 (Fannin County deed records
465/317). The property stayed in the Smithson family until Donald Spurgin bought it from
Ben Smithson’s heirs in 1998 (Fannin County deed records 863/383). The structures and
artifacts found at 41FN270 indicate that the farmstead dates to the early to mid-twentieth
century, meaning that early site components are more closely associated with the Braly
family, while later additions are attributed to the Jaco, Gray, and/or Smithson families.
U.S. Census records from 1910 to 1940 indicate the Bralys lived in Leonard proper and
likely did not live on this property, but they may have rented it to others.

including Ethel Braly Arnold (seated farthest to the right; from LPL 2005:71).

Of all of the property owners of note associated with Site 41FN270, only the Braly name
was included in the Leonard Preservation League’s History of Leonard, Texas Volume II
(2005:71). The Braly’s are described as a long-tenured family name in Fannin County
and Leonard in particular, with the first Fannin County Braly (Hugh Lee Braly; Byron’s
father) arriving from Ireland in 1844. According to the History of Leonard, Texas Volume II
(LPL 2005:71), H. L. Braly supplied much of the lumber and building supplies used in
the earliest construction of Leonard. At various times in his life, Byron Braly, who owned
the property from 1921 until his death in 1938 operated a cotton gin and bred Hereford
cattle, potentially using this tract for some of those activities (LPL 2005:71).
Even Ethel Braly Arnold’s passing in 1978 was noted in the History of Leonard, Texas
Volume II (LPL 2005:71) as “... of special importance to Fannin County and Leonard
historians. Her death signified the first time since 1844… that the county no longer had
representation by residency of a Braly family member.”
Summary

Overall, 41FN270 is an early-to-mid-twentieth-century archeological site whose presumed
main residence and a smaller dwelling or outbuilding have been recently demolished.
Features include a semi-subterranean storm shelter made of formed concrete, barns,
concrete troughs, and an animal shed constructed of modern lumber. Scraped earth and
a surface scatter of modern and historic-age artifacts were noted on the surface where a
small dwelling or outbuilding is depicted in historic aerial photography. The main barn, a
side barn, cow pens, and a well are features of the site that are farther south.

The highly fragmented historic-age artifacts encountered consisted of twentieth-century
ceramic sherds, glass shards, and other household refuse. No evidence was encountered
during the survey of the larger residence depicted closer to the road in the 1964 aerial
photograph. The 1936 Fannin County Highway Map (see Figure 13) depicts two structures
adjacent to one another in roughly the mapped location of Site 41FN270, suggesting that
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Archeological Survey for North Texas Municipal Water District’s Proposed Leonard Water Treatment Plant

the earliest components of this site date at least to this period. Lacking surface artifacts
throughout the site, it is difficult to discern which portions of the site originated first.
The storm shelter likely dates to the mid-twentieth century, and similar ones were
apparent in other yards in and around Leonard. Thus, it is not a particularly unique feature
and was associated with a former historic-age residence and outbuildings that have since
been removed. The integrity of the storm shelter’s context has been permanently altered
and further investigation would not likely result in additional new information important
to the history of Texas.

Finally, archival research suggests that the property is attributed to two members of the
Braly family: Byron and his daughter Ethel, who owned the property from 1921 through
1949. The depiction of a structure on the 1936 Fannin County highway map suggests
that some of the structures on the property are likely attributed to them, but the largest
structure (presumably the residence) is no longer extant. Those structures that are
present, the storm shelter, corrugated metal barns, and the plywood shed (particularly
the latter), are more likely attributed to later owners. Only the Braly family is specifically
listed in local histories, but the family’s local historical significance is derived from their
association with the founding of Leonard itself and not by the now-missing residence or
the agricultural activities carried out at Site 41FN270.
The former residence has been demolished or removed, negatively affecting the integrity
of the remaining features (storm shelter and barns) because the site’s context has been
permanently altered. Lacking research potential or association with the significance
of individuals of historical import, Site 41FN270 is recommended as not eligible for
designation as an SAL. No further work is recommended at this site.

The Deel-Whitworth Cemetery (41FN272)

During the current survey, archeologists recorded a small historic-age cemetery with
approximately nine interments in an isolated hardwood mott in Survey Segment 3,
approximately 50 meters west of a pond formed by damming Lee Creek (Figures
44–45). The markers reference different members of the Deel, Hall, and Whitworth
Families with interments dating from 1880 to 1925 (Table 3). A utilitarian barbed-wire
fenceline marked the cemetery’s visual boundary, forming a roughly rectangular area
of approximately 70 x 50 feet (north/south x east/west). A chain-link gate that has now
fallen originally allowed entrance from the west. The current barbed-wire fence was new
and formed an irregularly shaped perimeter, using available trees as fence posts.
Most of the interments include a headstone and footstone (the latter often inscribed with
the deceased’s initials). The markers were mostly plain text with the only embellishments
reserved for children’s markers (seven-year-old Mattie Deel’s marker included a dove
relief while one-year-old Alley Mae Moore’s headstone included a sleeping lamb relief).

Archeologists found the cemetery was in poor condition with almost all of the markers
toppled over (Figure 46). A cemetery record on Fannin County’s TXGenWeb site
postulates that this could be due to cattle getting into the cemetery (TXGenWeb 2019).
Due to vegetation overgrowth, archeologists were unable to observe much of the ground
surface and therefore were not able to identify any mounds that could suggest additional,
unmarked burials; however, several depressions were observed in the southern portion
of the cemetery near Richard and Jane Hall’s common grave. No depressions or mounds
were noted outside of the current fenceline. No shovel tests were excavated within the
cemetery, though Test MV11 was excavated approximately 10 meters to the north and
was devoid of artifacts.

Archival Summary
Deed research suggests that the artifacts and structural remains at the Deel-Whitworth
Cemetery (see Figure 46) are most likely associated with the Deel family and/or later
tenant farmers. The property was originally patented to William Hunt and John Black in
1847. The land company owned by Hunt and Black sold all 640 acres to Richard Thomas
in 1852 (Fannin County deed records F/149). Three years later, Richard Thomas gave his
daughter, Sarah Jane Thomas, 160 acres out of this parcel (Fannin County Deed Records
O/15). Census records from 1860 and 1870 indicate that Sarah continued to live with
her parents, unmarried, until she was at least 41; it is, therefore, unlikely that she lived

on the land given to her by her father. In 1872 she sold 25 acres of this land to Dillard
Deel (Fannin County Deed Records V/42). Deel built a homestead on this land for himself
and his large family, and he probably lived here until his death in 1901 (Fannin County
Deed Records 93/287). During the 30 years he lived there, he bought additional adjacent
land and established a small family cemetery on the original 25 acres. It is likely that
some of the artifacts from 41FN278 (see below) were associated with the Deel house or
outbuildings.

Between 1901 and 1903, Dillard Deel’s surviving children and heirs sold 42 acres of their
father’s land that included the original homestead and cemetery. In October 1901, about
six months after the death of Dillard Deel, seven of Deel’s children and presumed heirs
sold 43 acres of this land to J. F. Craven. However, this deed specifically reserved one acre
of land for the “Deel Graveyard” that was not included in the sale (Fannin County Deed
Records 88/175). Researchers could not find a specific definition of this reserved acre
and it is not included in any plat information. It is noteworthy that the cemetery is not
depicted on any topographic maps (modern or historic, see Figures 2 and 14), nor is it
shown on the 1936 Fannin County Highway Map (see Figure 13). It is, however, included
in the History of Leonard Volume II’s historic sites map (LPL 2005: inside rear cover).
Though the chain of title is somewhat unclear, A.J. and Cora Willis sold the same 42 acres
to B. B. Braly in 1914 (Fannin County Deed Records 135/77). The property stayed in
the Braly family until 1949 when Ethel Arnold, B. B. Braly’s daughter, sold the 42-acre
Deel tract and five other tracts totaling over 300 acres to W. R. Jaco (Fannin County Deed
Records 304/525). U.S. Census Records from 1910–1940 indicate that members of the
Braly/Arnold family lived in the town of Leonard rather than on a farm. They probably
rented out this land to tenant farmers as a source of additional income.

Nine graves are marked within the fenced bounds of the small cemetery, though it is
likely that additional unmarked graves are present in the vicinity. Table 3 shows the
names, birth, and death dates of marked graves. Archival research shows that all of these
individuals were related, with the possible exception of Mary Rilen, whose name could
not be found in available sources.
Dillard and Martha Deel and their children were the first of this extended family to move
from Tennessee to Fannin County sometime between 1865 and 1870 (1870 U.S. Census;
1880 U.S. Census; LPL 2005:96). His occupation was listed as “farmer” in U.S. Census data
spanning from 1860–1900. Dillard and Martha had at least ten children; only one, Mattie,
is known to be buried in this cemetery. One of their granddaughters, Alley May Morre, is
also buried here. Alley was the young daughter of Tennessee Deel Moore and M. C. Moore.

Richard and Jane Hall, brother and sister-in-law of Martha Deel, soon followed their
relatives to Texas, arriving in Ellis County between 1869 and 1870 (1870 U.S. Census).
By 1880 the Halls and their six children had moved to Fannin County, probably near their
relatives around Leonard (1880 U.S. Census).
Rachel Elizabeth Deel Whitworth was Dillard Deel’s younger sister. Rachel married
Andrew Fields Whitworth (from Mississippi) in 1868 and moved to Leonard from

Tennessee in 1889. Rachel and Andrew had twelve children, the youngest two of whom
were born in Leonard (LPL 2005:255).
Summary

The Deel-Whitworth Cemetery is a late nineteenth to early twentieth century family
cemetery located on a terrace overlooking what was, at the time of its use, Lee Creek.
The cemetery has suffered heavily from neglect and, according to some records, livestock
intrusion with almost all of the headstones no longer mounted to their bases. The cemetery
is attributed to at least three generations of the Dillard and Martha Deel Family, who
came to Leonard from Tennessee during the early Reconstruction Era (ca. 1865–1870).
If one assumes that individuals have not been re-interred from another location, it is
interesting to note that the Deel Family patriarch first buried his wife’s sister-in-law, Jane
Hall, here with blood relatives being buried in later years. With the Deel family known
to have been fairly large, it is likely that there are additional, unmarked graves within
the marked boundary. Though nine interments are known within the marked boundary,
several ground surface depressions could correspond with additional, unmarked burials.
Several interred individuals are listed in History of Leonard, Volume II (namely Dillard
and Martha Deel and AF and Rachel Whitworth), but none of the family descriptions or
individual biographies suggest that these were particularly historically significant people.
Census records suggest the Deels were farmers, which was common for this region.

The cemetery does not meet the criteria for listing as a SAL and is not listed on the Texas
Historical Commission’s Historic Sites Atlas but it is listed in deed records and it has been
depicted on several local historical sites maps and on the TxGenWeb website (2019).
Accordingly, it is not considered a newly-discovered cemetery that would require formal
recording at the Fannin County Clerk’s office. Under Chapters 711–715 of the Texas Health
and Safety Code, the cemetery is protected from future impacts and reasonable access
must be permitted to descendants unless the interments are removed and re-interred in
a perpetual care cemetery and the site undedicated.
Since this survey is intended primarily to identify potential archeological resource-related
constraints and no formal plans are proposed in the vicinity, the Principal Investigator
recommends that the Deel-Whitworth Cemetery is avoided. The Principal Investigator
recommends that the fallen gate is repaired to prohibit livestock from entering the site. In
addition, basic repairs, vegetation clearing, and general maintenance would be beneficial.
Deed records indicate that the Deel family had reserved one acre from their land sale for
the “Deel Graveyard.” With the marked cemetery boundary measuring less than a tenth
of an acre, and numerous Deel family members and descendants unaccounted-for in the
list of interments it is possible that additional, unmarked burials may be located nearby.
Though this is not intended to suggest an outright prohibition on construction in the
vicinity, should future needs require construction nearby, the Principal Investigator
recommends a 350-foot buffer surrounding the marked cemetery boundary be designated
for intensive survey for additional unmarked burials. This buffer should be sufficient to
account for any number of likely configurations of a one-acre tract unless specific metes

and bounds for it can be found. The results of such a survey can then be incorporated into
project’s design requirements.

Site 41FN273

Site 41FN273 is a small, diffuse historic-age trash scatter of glass, ferrous metal, and
ceramic artifacts located primarily on the ground surface near Survey Segment 1’s
southern boundary (Figure 47). All of the artifacts reflected domestic uses, dated to the
mid-twentieth century, and were fragmentary in nature given its context in a repeatedly
plowed field. The site measures approximately 22 x 72 meters (north-south by east-west;
70 x 237 feet), and at the time of survey, it was situated just north of an active construction
zone with pervasive disturbances associated with the construction of a terminal storage
reservoir. It encompasses 0.4 acres, and was defined by the extent of the surficial scatter
since only one whiteware sherd was encountered in a shovel test (WP6) and ground
surface visibility exceeded 30 percent (Figure 48). Site 41FN273 is about 125 meters
(410 feet) southwest of previously recorded site 41FN173.
One positive shovel test (WP6) was excavated within the site boundary along with three
other negative shovel tests (RB5, MM7, and WP7; Table 4), while three more negative
shovel tests (MG5, MM8, and MV5) were placed beyond the extent of the surficial scatter
of artifacts. Artifacts encountered include one intact amber-colored glass bottle; one
ferrous metal fragment (Figure 49); five whiteware sherds; one amber-colored glass
shard; two colorless glass pane shards; one cobalt-colored shard; one milk glass shard;
and a ferrous metal belt buckle fragment (Figure 50). None of the artifacts bore maker’s
marks and most of the artifacts were broken into small fragments, presumably from
repeated plowing. Site 41FN273 is on an upland terrace about 572 meters (1,875 feet)
east of an unnamed upland headwater tributary of Bear Creek. It is situated along CR
4950 about 366 meters (1,200 feet) west of CR 4965.
41FN273 Archival Summary

Several structures are depicted on the 1936 Fannin County Highway Map (see Figure 13)
paralleling what is assumed to be County Road 4950 near the recorded 41FN273 site
boundary, but these structures are notably set back from the roadway. The 1960/1964
topographic map of the area (see Figure 14) does not depict any structures along the
road while a detail of the 1964 aerial photograph suggests that this site is limited to what
appears to be a cleared county road frontage with no room for a residence or structural
complex (Figure 51). With no structural remains observed in the site vicinity or depicted
on any historic-age maps or aerial photographs, the authors interpret this site as an
isolated trash scatter that does not warrant more detailed archival review to assess SAL
eligibility.

Summary
Overall, 41FN273 is a minor mid-twentieth-century archeological site, based on its
assemblage. No features were recorded and no significant historic-age diagnostic artifacts
were encountered in any shovel test or on the surface. The crew noted no indication
of a former residence or structure. The artifact scatter may be associated with nearby
site 41FN173. It was also noted that the scatter was spread south of CR 4950, outside
the current survey area. It is possible that some trash along the recently cleared road
may have been spread out and exposed. Lacking research potential or association with
individuals of historical significance, site 41FN273 is recommended as not eligible for
designation as an SAL. No further work is recommended at this site.

Site 41FN276

Site 41FN276 consists of a surficial scatter of glass, metal, brick, and ceramic artifacts in a
fallow agricultural field in Survey Segment 1 (Figure 52). The assemblage was observed
on the surface of a recently cut hay field (Figure 53). All of the artifacts were fragmentary
in nature given its context in a repeatedly plowed field, and they reflected both domestic
and automotive uses. The site boundary measures approximately 86 x 74 meters (northsouth by east-west; 282 x 242 feet). It encompasses 0.13 acres, and was defined by the
extent of the surficial scatter since no artifacts were encountered in shovel tests and
ground surface visibility averaged 35 percent. Site 41FN276 is about 488 meters (1,600
feet) northwest of previously recorded site 41FN174, which is a free-standing cistern
made of unhewn limestone in an agricultural field, associated with whiteware sherds and
amethyst-colored shards. Site 41FN276 is also about 750 meters (2,460 feet) southwest
of previously recorded site 41FN172, which is a mid- to late-twentieth century house and
farm with a cistern along the west side of CR 4965. The age of site 41FN276 as indicated
by the artifacts observed would situate it between 41FN174 and the more recent site
41FN172.
One negative shovel test (MV8) was excavated within the site boundary, while three
others (RB7, WP9, and WP10) were placed beyond the extent of the surficial artifact
scatter (Table 5). Artifacts encountered include 25–30 red brick fragments (Figure 54);
one buff-colored brick fragment; one mortar fragment; one asphalt shingle fragment;
one brown-glazed crock sherd (Figure 55); one green-glazed lug sherd; five whiteware
sherds; one yellow-glazed sherd; one green glass bottle rim shard (Figure 56); five milk
glass shards; two AC 17 spark plugs; one ferrous metal buckle, one aqua-colored, glass
panel bottle, basal shard; one thick-pane glass shard; and several large (1 x 0.3 meter
[3 x 1 feet]) concrete slab fragments. Site 41FN276 is on a terrace about 96 meters (313
feet) east of an unnamed upland headwater tributary of Bear Creek. It is adjacent to the
south of an east-west trending transmission line corridor. Several of the concrete slab
fragments were piled around the nearby utility pole. No features were encountered at site
41FN276; artifacts were restricted to the surface and not found in subsurface contexts.
Based on the recent nature of most of the artifacts, the site may be an early- to midtwentieth century rural residence remnant that was razed, leaving fragments of building
materials such as shingles, bricks, mortar, and slab fragments. Most of the ceramic and
glass fragments are indicative of domestic uses, while the buckle may be from a horse
bridle, suggesting ranching or farming activities.

41FN276 Archival Summary
Several structures are depicted on the 1936 Fannin County Highway Map (see Figure
13) near the recorded 41FN276 site boundary with one structure notably set on the east
bank of Bear Creek. It is possible that 41FN276 is a scant remnant of a former structure,
particularly in light of bricks and concrete slab fragments being among the artifacts
observed, but with such a small survey area overlaid on a much larger-scaled map makes
definitive structure placement impossible. By the time the 1960/1964 topographic map
of the area (see Figure 14) was produced, no structures are depicted at all. The 1964
aerial photograph detail of the area shows a largely featureless field with no clear scars
or angular discolorations that would indicate a structure (Figure 57). With no structural
remains observed in the site vicinity or depicted on any historic-age maps or aerial
photographs, the authors interpret this site as an isolated trash scatter that does not
warrant more detailed archival review to assess SAL eligibility. With that stated, the site
may be associated with nearby, previously-recorded Sites 41FN172 and/or 41FN174, the
ownership histories of which were summarised in Cody et al. (2016:74, 77-78). Both sites
were determined to not be associated with individuals or events of historical significance.

Summary
Overall, 41FN276 is a mid-twentieth-century archeological site, based on its assemblage.
No features were recorded and no significant historic-age diagnostic artifacts were
encountered in any shovel test or on the surface. The crew noted no indication of a
former residence or structure, besides the fragmented construction material. The artifact
scatter may be associated with nearby sites 41FN172 and 41FN174, both of which had
residential components. Lacking research potential or association with individuals of
historical significance, Site 41FN276 is recommended as not eligible for designation as
an SAL. No further work is recommended at this site.

Site 41FN277

Site 41FN277 consists of a sparse, surficial scatter of early- to mid-twentieth century
glass, brick, and ceramic artifacts in a fallow agricultural field in Survey Segment 2
(Figure 58). The assemblage was observed on the surface of a recently harvested cotton
field (see Figure 7). All of the artifacts were fragmentary in nature given their context in
a repeatedly plowed field, and they reflected domestic uses. The site boundary measures
approximately 29 x 26 meters (north-south by east-west; 93 x 86 feet). It encompasses
0.14 acres, and was defined by the extent of the surficial scatter since no artifacts were
encountered in shovel tests and ground surface visibility averaged 85 percent.

Site 41FN277 is about 122 meters (1,090 feet) southwest of site 41FN269 about 333
meters (1,092 feet) west of Lee Creek. Given their proximity to each other and the similar
age of the artifacts, sites 41FN269 and 41FN277 may be associated. No sign of a former
residence or other structures was apparent at 41FN277.

Due to its small size, two negative shovel tests (RB12 and MV10) were excavated beyond
the extent of the surficial scatter of artifacts (Table 6; Figure 59). Artifacts encountered
on the ground surface within the scatter include five cobalt blue-colored ointment jar base
shards (Figure 60), five aqua-colored bottle glass shards, 34 colorless bottle glass shards
(Figure 61), two milk glass shards (including a Mason jar lid fragment [Figure 62]),
one amber-colored glass shard, one colorless bottle with stippling, one colorless window
pane shard, three whiteware sherds, one terracotta-colored sherd, and two graphite
battery insulators. The cobalt blue glass shards have a nested double triangle maker’s
mark that is attributed to Vicks Vaporub jars dating to roughly the 1910s through the
1930s (Whitten 2019).
No features were encountered at site 41FN277; artifacts were restricted to the surface
and not found in subsurface contexts. Based on the recent nature of most of the artifacts,
the site is interpreted as a mid-twentieth century refuse dump. Glass, brick, ceramic, and
battery fragments are indicative of domestic uses.

41FN277 Archival Summary
No structures are depicted on the 1936 Fannin County Highway Map (see Figure 13) near
the recorded 41FN277 site boundary nor are any depicted on the 1960/1964 topographic
map of the area (see Figure 14). A detail of the 1964 aerial photograph suggests that
this site may have been disturbed and displaced by field terracing (Figure 63). With no
structural remains observed in the site vicinity or depicted on any historic-age maps or
aerial photographs, the authors interpret this site as an isolated trash scatter that does
not warrant more detailed archival review to assess SAL eligibility.
Summary

Overall, 41FN277 is an early- to mid-twentieth-century archeological site, based on
its assemblage. No features were recorded and no significant historic-age diagnostic

Site 41FN278
Site 41FN278 consists of a surficial scatter of early-twentieth-century glass, ferrous
metal, brick, and ceramic artifacts in a pasture within Survey Segment 3 (Figure 64). The
assemblage was observed on the surface of a grassy pasture along the shore of the large
artificial Lee Creek stock pond (Figure 65). Some of the metal artifacts were intact, but
most of the ceramic and glass artifacts were fragmentary in nature given their context in
an active cow pasture. The assemblage reflects both domestic and ranching uses. The site
boundary measures approximately 48 x 58 meters (north-south by east-west; 158 x 192
feet). It encompasses 0.6 acres, and was defined by the extent of the surficial scatter and
six shovel tests since ground surface visibility averaged 20 percent. One whiteware sherd
in shovel test MG10 and one ferrous metal wire fragment in MG 12 were the only buried
artifacts (Table 7). The other four shovel tests (RB15, MG11, WP16, and MV13) were
negative for cultural resources.
Artifacts from the surface include 20 whiteware sherds (two with partial maker’s marks
that appear to be Royal Ironstone Patent marks; Figure 66–67); 20 shards of colorless,
aqua-, cobalt-, and amethyst-colored glass; 15 ferrous metal fragments; four cut limestone
blocks of various dimensions (Figure 68); one PALMER brick fragment; and one mule
shoe (Figure 69). No sign of a former residence foundation or other structures was
apparent at 41FN278.
The site is interpreted as an early-twentieth-century farmstead remnant lacking any
evidence of structures with a shallowly buried to surface scatter of household and farm
refuse. The single Palmer brick fragment is attributed to the Palmer Press Brick Company
in Palmer, Texas, which was founded in 1902. In 1929, Palmer bought the Standard Brick
Co. and changed its name to Barron Brick Company (Brown 2019). This suggests the
fragment observed within Site 41FN278 dates to the first three decades of the twentieth
century.

Site 41FN278 is on a terrace flanking Lee Creek about 123 meters (405 feet) southsouthwest of the Deel-Whitworth Cemetery, which is a small family cemetery used from
at least 1880 to the mid 1920s. Formally dedicated in 1902 by J. M. Deel, the cemetery
contains nine headstones for people with Deel, Hall, Moore, Rilen, and Whitworth last
names. There are also four footstones and several depressions suggesting additional
unmarked graves. Given the site and the cemetery’s proximity to each other and the
overlapping age ranges of the artifacts and headstones, they are likely associated. The
Deel-Whitworth Cemetery was discussed in depth above.
A two-track road traverses the western half of the site. No features were encountered
at 41FN278 and only two artifacts were shallowly buried (0–35 cmbs), the remainder
were on the surface. Three large limestone blocks were scattered around a tree on the
southeastern edge of the site, while two more were near the site’s northern edge. These
may have been used as foundation stones for a structure, or they may represent the raw
material for cemetery markers. The latter is particularly noteworthy in this instance due
to the site’s proximity to the nearby Deel-Whitworth Cemetery.

Deed research suggests that the artifacts and structural remains at site 41FN278 are most
likely associated with the Deel family and/or twentieth-century tenant farmers leasing
from the Braly family (both described above). The property was originally patented in
1847 to William Hunt and John Black, partners in a land company, who sold all 640 acres
to Richard Thomas in 1852 (Fannin County deed records F/149). Three years later he
gave his daughter, Sarah Jane Thomas, 160 acres out of this parcel (Fannin County Deed
Records O/15). In 1872 she sold 25 acres of this land to Dillard Deel (Fannin County Deed
Records V/42). Deel built a homestead on this land for himself and his large family, and
he probably lived here until his death in 1901 (Fannin County Deed Records 93/287). He
established a small family cemetery (Deel-Whitworth Cemetery) and it is possible that
some of the artifacts from 41FN278 were associated with the Deel house or outbuildings.
Between 1901 and 1903, Dillard Deel’s surviving children and heirs sold 42 acres of their
father’s land that included the original homestead and cemetery. A. J. and Cora Willis then
sold the same 42 acres to B. B. Braly in 1914 (Fannin County Deed Records 135/77). The
property stayed in the Braly family until 1949 (Fannin County Deed Records 304/525).
Based on census data, the Braly family lived in town and probably rented out this land to
tenant farmers.
A structure is depicted in the general site vicinity on the 1936 Fannin County Highway
map but none is depicted on the 1960/1964 topographic quadrangle of the area (see
Figures 13–14). The 1964 aerial photograph detail of the site area does show some trees
that are distributed in a way that could suggest a rectangular fenceline, but they are too
sparse to make a definitive conclusion (Figure 70).
Summary

Overall, 41FN278 is an early-twentieth-century archeological site based on its
assemblage and association with the nearby Deel-Whitworth Cemetery. No features were
recorded and no significant historic-age diagnostic artifacts were encountered in any
shovel test or on the surface. Crew noted no indication of a former residence or structure,
besides one fragmented brick and four possible foundation stones. The artifact scatter is
possibly the site of a former homestead and associated with the nearby Deel-Whitworth
Cemetery, a small family cemetery dating from 1880 to the mid 1920s. Lacking research
potential or association with individuals of historical significance, Site 41FN278 is
recommended as not eligible for designation as an SAL. No further work is recommended
at this site.

Site 41FN274

Site 41FN274 is an isolated well and small historic-age trash scatter on the edge of an
unnamed upland headwater tributary of Bear Creek in Survey Segment 1. (Figure 71).
The site boundary measures approximately 32 x 20 meters (north-south by east-west;
103 x 66 feet). It encompasses 0.13 acre, and its boundary was defined by buffering the
location of the two features recorded at the site. Seven shovel tests were excavated within
30 meters of the site, including JB8, JB10, and SP8 that were inside the site boundary
(Table 8).

None of the shovel tests were positive for cultural resources. Surface inspection of the
area farther afield also encountered no artifacts.

The well, designated Feature 1, is situated on a slope of the eastern bank of an unnamed
upland headwater tributary of Bear Creek (Figures 72–73). It is a single-course-thick
brick structure with a 1-inch-thick cement lining on the exterior. No markings or
engravings were observed on the bricks or the outer cement lining. Feature 1 measures
approximately 45 inches tall on the creek side and 18–24 inches tall on the bank side,
with an inner diameter of about 28 inches at the mouth. The uppermost courses of brick
were not present. The well’s interior is bottle-shaped with an outward curve, though not
much else could be determined about the interior shape because the water table was high
at the time of survey, being less than four feet from the mouth of the well.
Feature 2 at site 41FN274, a historic-age trash scatter, is situated on the opposite bank of
Lee Creek from Feature 1. Artifacts included one galvanized water tank/trough; one post1930s 55-gallon drum; one hood panel from a 1937 Ford truck (Figure 74); burned can
fragments; one roll of barbed wire; sparse miscellaneous metal fragments, undecorated
whiteware sherds, one Pierce Glass 2-ounce apothecary bottle (Figure 75); and one
Hazel-Atlas soda or condiment bottle.

The Pierce Glass apothecary bottle was manufactured from 1905–1987 (though most
likely pre-World War II; Lockhart et al. 2018a), while the Hazel-Atlas soda or condiment
bottle was manufactured after 1931 (Lockhart et al. 2018b). The absence of trash dating
to later in the twentieth century suggests that Feature 2 may date to the early- to midtwentieth century, possibly pre-World War II.
41FN274 Archival Summary

No structures are depicted in the vicinity of Site 41FN274 on the 1936 Fannin County
Highway Map or the 1960/1964 topographic quadrangle, nor are any structures visible
on the 1964 aerial photograph of the site area (see Figures 13–14, Figure 76). With no
structural remains observed in the site vicinity or depicted on any historic-age maps or
aerial photographs, the authors interpret this site as an agricultural feature that does not
warrant archival review to assess SAL eligibility.

Summary
Overall, 41FN274 is an early- to mid-twentieth-century archeological site, based on its
assemblage. Two features were recorded including an isolated brick and cement well
and a trash scatter. No significant historic-age diagnostic artifacts were encountered
in any shovel test or on the surface, and there was no indication of a former residence
or structure at this location. The artifact scatter may be associated with nearby sites
41FN172 or 41FN276, which had confirmed or potential residential components.
Lacking research potential or association with individuals of historical significance, Site
41FN274 is recommended as not eligible for designation as an SAL. No further work is
recommended at this site.

Site 41FN275

Site 41FN275 is an isolated well located approximately 15 feet south of the MKT
Railroad right-of-way in Survey Segment 2 (Figure 77). The site boundary measures
approximately 31 x 31 meters (north-south by east-west; 102 x 102 feet). It encompasses
0.16 acre, and its boundary was defined by buffering the location of the well. No shovel
tests were excavated in the site or in its vicinity because the entire surrounding area is
a natural seep several acres in size with standing water at the surface. No artifacts were
observed on the surface of the survey area within 100 meters of the well. Within the
adjacent railroad right-of-way were noted some metal cans, discarded crossties, and a
utility pole fragment (Figure 78).
The well housing is intact and its outer dimensions measure approximately 45 inches
tall by 45 inches wide. It is covered by a thick cement cap with an inset 10-inch cement
plug (Figure 79). No markings or engravings were observed on the bricks or the outer
cement lining. Because of the cap, the interior characteristics of the well could not be
inspected. Although larger than Feature 1 at site 41FN274, the well at 41FN275 was
similarly constructed as a brick structure with a cement lining on the exterior. Similar
wells were observed in Sites 41FN269 and 41FN270 as well.
41FN275 Archival Summary

With no structural remains observed in the site vicinity or depicted on any
historic-age maps or aerial photographs (Figure 80), the authors interpret this site as
an isolated agricultural feature that was placed to provide water from the natural seep,
potentially as an alternative to easily polluted surface water. Such an isolated feature
does not warrant archival review beyond what has been conducted here to assess SAL
eligibility.
Summary

Site 41FN275 is likely an early- to mid-twentieth-century archeological site, based on its
similar construction to area features. The site consists of an isolated brick and cement well.
No significant historic-age diagnostic artifacts were encountered in any nearby shovel
test or on the surface, and there was no indication of a former residence or structure at
this location. The well may be associated with nearby sites 41FN269 or 41FN270, which
both had agricultural and ranching components. Lacking research potential or association
with individuals of historical significance, Site 41FN275 is recommended as not eligible
for designation as an SAL. No further work is recommended at this site.

1996 Structure Complex
North of CR 4960 in Survey Segment 2 is a structural complex that was moved to the site
or constructed after 1996. It contains a circa 1996 prefabricated house (Figure 81) with
modern outbuildings and a barn. Located just north of CR 4960, the house has an attached
carport on the northwestern end. On the same property are two modern outbuildings
(Figures 82–83). The house is a manufactured home that is not of historic age and not a
permanent structure. The outbuildings are modern as well. Due to their recent age, they
are not eligible for designation as an SAL.

Northwest of and associated with the structure complex is a horse barn. The building is
a simple wood-frame structure with repurposed telephone poles, and corrugated metal
roofing and siding (Figure 84). The driveway from CR 4960 provides access to both the
house and barn. As a modern building possessing no exceptional historical significance,
it is not eligible for designation as an SAL.

Currently Occupied Residential Complexes

In the southeastern quadrant of the intersection of CR 4965 and the MKT Railroad
(opposite site 41FN172) are two adjacent residential complexes in Survey Segment 2
that are currently occupied. All structures were determined in the field to be of modern
construction. According to aerial photography, the two residences were moved to the
site or constructed between October 2005 and March 2006. Due to their recent age, they
were not assigned a trinomial and are not eligible for SAL designation.

Conclusions and Recommendations
AmaTerra archeologists surveyed approximately 539 acres of land west of the community
of Leonard on behalf of NTMWD under Antiquities Permit 8873. Within a portion of this
survey area, NTMWD plans to install a 67-acre TSR, 32-acre borrow area, access roads,
electrical lines, and various outlet and recycled water pipelines within a roughly 370acre fenced area that is equally overlapped by the current and previously conducted
archeological survey footprints. All of the known and defined project component areas
have been intensively surveyed at this point. Beyond this, NTMWD does not have any formal
plans for any portion of the remainder but requested the survey to gather archeological
constraints information for future project planning. While not explicitly conducted for
Section 106 compliance, the Principal Investigator did consider the possibility that
future projects could include federal involvement and therefore federal cultural resource
regulatory recommendations are provided where possible. Investigators found the TSR
survey area to be largely devoid of significant cultural resources despite extensive shovel
testing, pedestrian survey, and the attempted revisit of previously recorded site 41FN173.
Only four of the 187 shovel tests excavated within the survey area contained cultural
material, and in all instances this material was limited to typical historic-age isolated
debris located in the upper 20 centimeters of sediments. Eight archeological sites and
one family cemetery were recorded, none of which is recommended as eligible for listing
as SALs.
The current survey’s crew revisited the site 41FN173 area but were unable to relocate
the unmarked buried well feature due to vegetation growth. It is presumed that if the
site is still extant, it is unlikely to contain previously unrecorded significant components;
therefore, no change in significance or resource management recommendations is
warranted.
Site 41FN269 is an early-to-mid-twentieth-century archeological site centered around a
brick-lined well and a barn. No historic-age diagnostic artifacts were encountered in any
shovel test or on the surface. Disturbances were noted associated with the demolition
of the former residence at this location. The integrity of the site’s context has been
permanently altered by the removal of a former historic-age residence and outbuildings,
and further investigation would not likely result in additional new information important
to the history of Texas. Lacking research potential or association with individuals of
historical significance, site 41FN269 is recommended as not eligible for designation as
an SAL or as a Historic Property. No further work is recommended at this site.
Site 41FN270 is an early-to-mid-twentieth-century archeological site whose remaining
features include a historic-age storm shelter, two barns, cow pens, animal troughs, an
animal shed, a functioning pump and well, a capped well, an area of burning associated with
a former structure’s footprint and a surficial scatter of modern and historic-age artifacts.

The former residence and a smaller dwelling or outbuilding have been demolished or
removed from the site, negatively affecting the integrity of the remaining features (storm
shelter and husbandry features) because the site’s context has been permanently altered.
Lacking research potential or association with individuals of historical significance,
site 41FN270 is recommended as not eligible for designation as an SAL or as a Historic
Property. No further work is recommended at this site.
The Deel-Whitworth Cemetery (41FN272) has headstones dating from 1880 to the mid
1920s. Dillard Deel, the family patriarch, bought 25 acres in 1872 and built a homestead
on this land for himself and his large family. Nine graves are marked with Deel, Hall, Moore,
Rilen, and Whitworth last names within the fenced bounds of the small cemetery, though
it is possible that additional unmarked graves are present in the vicinity. The site is not
eligible for SAL or Historic Property designation, but it is protected by the Texas Health
and Safety Code. In addition to suggested basic maintenance and repair, it is recommended
that the Deel-Whitworth Cemetery be preserved in place. Deed records indicate that one
acre of land had been set aside for the “Deel Graveyard,” less than one tenth of which
is accounted-for by the marked cemetery. Accordingly, additional, unmarked burials are
possible beyond the marked boundary. If any future projects are proposed within 350
feet of the cemetery boundary, the Principal Investigator recommends intensive survey of
any planned impact footprint prior to construction to minimize the potential for impacts
to unmarked burials (Figure 85).

Site 41FN273 is a mid-twentieth-century archeological site with no features. No significant
historic-age diagnostic artifacts were encountered in any shovel test or on the surface. The
crew noted no indication of a former residence or structure. No structural remains were
observed in the site vicinity or depicted on any historic-age maps or aerial photographs.
Lacking research potential or association with individuals of historical significance, Site
41FN273 is recommended as not eligible for designation as an SAL or Historic Property.
No further work is recommended at this site.

Site 41FN276 is an early- to mid-twentieth-century archeological site with no features.
No significant historic-age diagnostic artifacts were encountered in any shovel test or
on the surface. The crew noted no indication of a former residence or structure, besides
fragmented construction material. No structural remains were observed in the site
vicinity or depicted on any historic-age maps or aerial photographs. Lacking research
potential or association with individuals of historical significance, Site 41FN276 is
recommended as not eligible for designation as an SAL or Historic Property. No further
work is recommended at this site.
Site 41FN277 is an early- to mid-twentieth-century archeological site with no features.
No significant historic-age diagnostic artifacts were encountered in any shovel test or
on the surface. Crew noted no indication of a former residence or structure, besides
fragmented brick. No structural remains were observed in the site vicinity or depicted on
any historic-age maps or aerial photographs. Lacking research potential or association
with individuals of historical significance, Site 41FN277 is recommended as not eligible
for designation as an SAL or Historic Property. No further work is recommended at this
site.

Site 41FN278 is an early-twentieth-century archeological site, based on its assemblage
and association with the Deel-Whitworth Cemetery. No features were recorded and no
significant historic-age diagnostic artifacts were encountered in any shovel test or on
the surface. Crew noted no indication of a former residence or structure, besides one
fragmented brick and four possible foundation stones. The artifact scatter may be a
former homestead, potentially that of Dillard and Martha Deel, or of later tenant farmers
leasing to the Braly family. Lacking research potential or association with individuals of
historical significance, Site 41FN278 is recommended as not eligible for designation as an
SAL or Historic Property. No further work is recommended at this site.
Site 41FN274 is an early- to mid-twentieth-century archeological site, based on its
assemblage from two features including an isolated brick and cement well and a trash
scatter. No significant historic-age artifacts were encountered in any shovel test or on the
surface, and there was no indication of a former residence or structure at this location.
No structural remains were observed in the site vicinity or depicted on any historic-age
maps or aerial photographs. Lacking research potential or association with individuals of
historical significance, Site 41FN274 is recommended as not eligible for designation as an
SAL or Historic Property. No further work is recommended at this site.

Site 41FN275 is likely an early- to mid-twentieth-century archeological site, based on its
similar construction to area features. The site consists of an isolated brick and cement well.
No significant historic-age diagnostic artifacts were encountered in any nearby shovel
test or on the surface, and there was no indication of a former residence or structure at
this location. No structural remains were observed in the site vicinity or depicted on any
historic-age maps or aerial photographs. Lacking research potential or association with
individuals of historical significance, Site 41FN275 is recommended as not eligible for
designation as an SAL or Historic Property. No further work is recommended at this site.

Based upon the information gathered through field survey, the Principal Investigator
recommends that the currently defined project components, including the TSR, borrow
pit, access roads, electrical utilities, and associated outflow pipelines should proceed
with no impacts to SALs or Historic Properties anticipated and no further archeological
fieldwork or coordination required. The Principal Investigator recommends that the
Deel-Whitworth Cemetery be avoided in future project planning. Intensive archeological
survey is recommended for any future development project that will be located within
a 350-foot buffer surrounding the cemetery to account for the discrepancy between the
marked boundary and the acre of land that had been set aside for use as a cemetery.
Once surveyed and confirmed to be devoid of marked or unmarked burials, construction
outside of the marked cemetery boundary should proceed.
The Principal Investigator recommends that any project plans outside of this buffer are
not likely to impact significant, intact archeological resources that would be eligible for
listing as SALs or Historic Properties. Planning and construction should proceed with no
further ACT-related coordination required. In addition, though survey was not conducted
explicitly for Section 106 compliance purposes, the dearth of significant non-archeological
cultural resources within and directly adjacent to the survey footprint suggests that
92

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 6

future federal undertakings located on this tract are unlikely to result in adverse direct
or indirect effects to Historic Properties and construction should proceed in accordance
with the procedures outlined in 36 CFR 800. Any currently-undefined, future project
that includes federal-level cultural resource coordination in the survey area is unlikely
to directly effect significant cultural resources. Indirect adverse effects are also not likely,
but the effects must be assessed on a case by case basis (indirect effects of a new road
are substantially different from a 200-foot-tall communication tower, for example) with
reference to the findings and recommendations provided in this report to assure Section
106 compliance. In the unlikely event that unrecorded, significant archeological or nonarcheological cultural resources are encountered on the property at a future date, all
work in the immediate area should cease until such time as the resource can be formally
assessed for significance and the THC can be informed.
This report is offered in partial fulfillment of Antiquities Permit 8873.
