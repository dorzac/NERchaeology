ABSTRACT

During the early and middle part of June of 2007, AR Consultants, Inc.
conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed
4,500 feet long force main pipeline route and a lift station in Mansfield
which is located in southern Tarrant County, Texas. The proposed force
main pipeline route and lift station are to constructed west of and mostly
adjacent to South Holland Road. The survey was done for Freese and
Nichols, Inc. which is doing the environmental permitting for the City of
Mansfield. Since Mansfield is a political entity of the State of Texas, the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission issued Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 4490 for the archaeological survey.
No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface
during the survey or uncovered during six shovel tests. Based upon the
absence of archaeological sites, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted. Also, we
recommend that if buried cultural resources are uncovered during
construction, construction should cease immediately in that area and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be
notified. Work should not continue until the necessary discussions with
the Texas Historical Commission have been conducted.

INTRODUCTION

The City of Mansfield intends to construct approximately 4,500 feet of force main and a
lift station which is approximately 50 feet wide and long and excavated to 40 feet in
depth approximately 3 miles southeast of Mansfield. The force main generally will
parallel an existing pipeline route and the lift station will be constructed west of an
existing lift station. The force main will be placed within a 120 feet right-of-way owned
and operated by the City of Mansfield. The proposed pipeline route begins southeast of
and adjacent to North Holland Road and most of the proposed force main route and lift
station will be located to the west of and adjacent to South Holland Road (Figure 1).
The purpose of the investigation was to determine if cultural resources are present in the
proposed construction areas and to make recommendations about their archaeological
significance, how they might be impacted by development and to place the discovered
cultural resources in a regional context. Antiquities permit number 4490 was issued to
AR Consultants, Inc. to do this survey since the City of Mansfield is a political entity of
the State of Texas and the Antiquities Code of Texas applies to this investigation. In
addition, Low Branch contains Waters of the US, and relevant federal legislation includes
Section 404 Permit for the Clean Waters Act, the National Historic Preservation Act of
1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93291), Executive Order Number 11593, “Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural
Environment”, and Procedures for the Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties
(36CFR800), Appendix C.
This report was written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Texas Historical Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report contains a brief description of the
natural environment and then a summary of previous archaeological investigations in the
area as known from published sources. This is followed by the research design and the
methodology. The description of the results of the field investigation constitutes the
major part of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations that arise from the
study. A list of references cited concludes the report.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Tarrant County is located in North Central Texas. The county consists mainly of
undulating to hilly land and vegetation consists of tall grasses and various species of trees
such as mesquite, elm, oak, pecan and walnut. The sandy loams in the Western Cross
Timbers drain into the West Fork of the Trinity River. Streams in the Fort Worth Prairie,
in which the study area lies (Dyksterhuis 1946:Figure 1), drain into the upper tributaries
of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River. The southwestern portion of the county drain into
the Brazos River (Dyksterhuis 1948:Figure 1).
The study area is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous-aged Eagle Ford Formation (Bureau
of Economic Geology 1972) which consists of shale. Low Branch is not mapped as
containing Quaternary alluvium.
Soils in the study area belong to the Houston Black-Navo-Heiden Association which are
gently sloping upland clays and loams (Ressel 1981:General Soils Map). The soil north
of Low Branch’s north bank is mapped as Chatt silty clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes and
Houston Black clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes. Both banks of Low Branch are mapped as
eroded Ferris clay with 5 to 12 percent slopes and Low Branch’s channel contains
frequently flooded Ovan clay (Ressel 1981:Inset 59).
Low Branch is mapped as perennial on both the USGS map but intermittent on the soil
map for Tarrant County, Texas.
Fauna are varied and abundant with at least 49 species of mammals, 39 species of snakes,
17 species of reptiles and other species (Blair 1950:101 – 102). Common forms of fauna
include deer, raccoon, opossum, rabbit, lizards and turtles. Armadillos have invaded the
area within the past 50 years. Various authors, including Lynott (1979), believed that the
prairie was inhabited by now extinct bison and antelope.
Prikryl (1993:192-193) suggested that prior to 12,000 B.C., the climate of north central
Texas was cooler and moister than at present. Between 12,000 and 8,000 B.C., the
climate became warmer and this continued to the present, but with brief mesic periods.
He adds that the presence of high grass pollen and low arboreal pollen between 5550
to1050 B.C. indicate a drying with a return of arboreal pollen after 1050 B.C. The later
change is similar to today’s environment. High grass pollen also occured at
approximately A.D. 450 and from A.D. 1550 to 1650, and this also indicates drier
periods. The presence of paleosols between A.D. 1 and 1000 suggested an increase in
moisture during this period with a return to drier conditions after A.D. 1000.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Over the past several decades, cultural resources investigations in North Central Texas
have varied due to the locations and types of projects being carried out. Therefore, the
database of information to which new projects can be compared is limited. The following
culture history is derived from the monograph Lower Elm Fork Prehistory by Daniel J.
Prikryl (1990). Prikryl's framework includes the six prehistoric periods, to which the
historic Native American and European periods have been added.
Using Prikryl’s time framework, the following paragraphs present a brief description of
the culture history of the region.
Historic European
Historic Native American
Late Prehistoric II
Late Prehistoric I
Late Archaic
Middle Archaic
Early Archaic
Paleoindian

AD 1800 to Present
AD 1600 to AD 1850
AD 1300 to AD 1600
AD 700 to AD 1300
2,000 BC to AD 700
4,000 BC to 2,000 BC
6,000 BC to 4,000 BC
ca. 11,000 BC to 6,000 BC

The Paleoindian period is distinguished by distinctive projectile point styles attributed to
this period (Meltzer and Bever 1995:Table 1). Many of the points are made of exotic
cherts that are not native to North Central Texas. The Lewisville site and the Aubrey
Clovis site in Denton County are the only excavated Paleoindian sites in the region.
Surface artifacts generally come from deposits on stream terraces above the level of the
active floodplain. This was a period when large mammals became extinct, and their
extinction is attributed in part to a general drying of the environment.
During the Early Archaic, the general drying continued, and sites are found on stream
terraces. There is a hint of population increase, and Lynott (1981:103) suggests that there
was increased emphasis on the use of bottomland food resources. Prikryl (1990:71) can
not confirm Lynott's suggestion, and in fact, he reports fewer bottomland sites than
during the previous period. Middle Archaic sites are predominantly found on the first
terrace above stream floodplains. As earlier, sites tend to be along the Elm Fork rather
than along the smaller tributaries. It appears that population density continued to be low.
Late Archaic sites increase in number over the previous period, and sites are located both
along the rivers and along tributaries. There appears to be a strong shift in site location to
the tributary streams and a pronounced population explosion. Local Ogallala quartzite is
being used prominently at this time, and this observation is taken by some authors as
evidence of increased territorial restrictions (Prikryl 1990).
During the Late Prehistoric I period, the bow and arrow and pottery appear in artifact
assemblages. Houses and probable evidence of agriculture first appear during this period,
although none are known in the immediate area. Site locations mirror those of the Late

Archaic, and quartzite continues as the common material used for chipped stone
projectiles and tools. The West Fork Paleosol is dated to this period, and drying
continued into the subsequent period (Peter and McGregor 1988; Ferring 1990).
The Late Prehistoric II is highlighted by the prominence of buffalo in archaeological sites
and the appearance of tools normally expected to occur at sites on the High Plains of
West Texas. It also appears that sites are once again located on sandy terraces above the
floodplains (Peter and McGregor 1988).
Beginning in the 1830s and continuing into the 1840s, according to some historical
documents, the aboriginal inhabitants of North Central Texas continued to play an
infamous if not important role in the history of that region. Very little archaeological
evidence, however, of historic Native American occupation has been found in the North
Central Texas. This is a pattern seen throughout much of Texas, and one which has been
suggested is due to the inability of the Native Americans to adapt to the changing climate
(Skinner 1988).
The 1830s and 1840s were decades of Anglo expansion into North Central Texas. Garrett
(1972:24), a well-respected Fort Worth historian, has stated that "Indian hostilities almost
depopulated North Texas [of Anglo settlers] after 1839. It dwindled to less than half".
According to tradition, many Indians of several tribes roamed the region until well into
the 1860s. Strategies for dealing with the illusive aboriginal population ranged from
armed confrontation and pursuit to across-the-table dialogue. Rising from a domestic
background of dealing with Indians, President of the Republic of Texas, Sam Houston,
realized rapprochement was preferable to direct confrontation. In the summer of 1843, a
council with the Indians was called, and in September of that year ten tribes signed a
treaty which was approved by the Senate the following January. The treaty provided the
needed impetus for settlement of several counties in the North-Central Texas area. The
earliest Anglo settlements in Tarrant County were Bird's Fort, established around 1840,
and Lonesome Dove, settled in 1845. Lonesome Dove, located near present-day
Grapevine, was the first permanent settlement in Tarrant County (Garrett 1972:55). The
county itself was organized in 1850, but it was not until 1860 that Fort Worth was
officially named the county seat, that designation having been transferred from Birdville
(Webb 1952:708). Settlers, however, had been steadily arriving in the county during
those 20 years. Many came through the auspices of Peters Colony land grants, although
only 160 families and single pioneers took advantage of the grants (Garrett 1972:57).
In 1849, Major Ripley Allan Arnold was assigned to build a military post on the upper
Trinity in the largely uninhabited geographical region of the Grand Prairie and the
Eastern Cross Timbers. This encampment was established on a high bluff overlooking the
confluence of the West and Clear Forks of the Trinity River. Within a short length of
time, there were about 12 double log cabins near the fort, and life in Fort Town definitely
had its refinements (Garrett 1972:80). The fort as a military post was relatively shortlived due to the continual westward movement of the frontier. In September of 1853,
troops abandoned the barracks and parade ground to the local population.

The Civil War took its toll on Tarrant County's population, as most of the able-bodied
men left to fight for the Confederacy. Fort Worth's renaissance was motivated by growth
of the cattle industry and the arrival of the railroad. By 1870, it is estimated that 300,000
head of cattle had been driven through Fort Worth. By the end of the nineteenth century,
Fort Worth had shed its "six-shooter" culture for a more refined cow town culture which
was beginning to use its past to advantage.
Oil was the next great influence on the life of Fort Worth. Fort Worth became the
gateway to the West Texas oil fields (Knight 1953:192) and both fed the population and
served as an impetus for post-World War II industrial development. The Convair plant
and Tarrant Field (later Carswell Field) had played an important role during the war, and
rather than lose their jobs the employees were retained to work on a secret project, the B36. Once again, Fort Worth became a focal point for an industry as she had for so many
decades.
The first steam-powered gristmill in the county, and possibly the state, was built in
southeastern Tarrant County. The settlement that grew up around the gristmill became
Mansfield (originally spelled Mansfeild after the co-owner of the grist mill and owner of
the merchandise store). By 1860, Mansfield had a post office, and several businesses, and
by the late 1860s, a college. The town continued to prosper as a rural city, but became a
modern suburb as people flocked to Mansfield to live and to work in Fort Worth. Several
manufacturing industries, such as the Carnation Company, moved into Mansfield
increasing its growth into Ellis County, Texas (Hart 2004).
Previous Investigations
The major archaeological survey conducted near Mansfield was for the proposed
Lakeview Lake (Skinner and Connors 1979). This survey discovered 37 historic and
prehistoric sites in addition to five already recorded sites. This survey was followed by
National Register testing and excavation of five of the sites (Raab et al. 1982). The
testing was followed by the excavation of six prehistoric sites by Southern Methodist
University (Peter and McGregor 1988) on what now was named Joe Pool Lake. The
investigated historical sites were described by Jurney and others (1988).
No archaeological sites were listed along the proposed pipeline route for the Britton,
Texas 7.5’ USGS map on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2007) or in the vicinity of
the study area. However, according to the Atlas, the Low Branch’s channel was surveyed
during the Joe Pool project. Two archaeological surveys along Walnut Creek were
conducted approximately 4 miles west of the survey area. AR Consultants (Skinner and
Whorton 1994) performed the archaeological survey for the Kathryn Rose Memorial
Park. Thirty-one acres were investigated and no archaeological sites were found. AR
Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2004) conducted an archaeological survey west of
and adjacent to Kathryn Rose Memorial Park. Approximately 19 acres and about 1,100
feet of trail route were investigated. No archaeological sites were seen on the ground
surface or found in 16 shovel tests.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The purpose of the research design was to insure that fieldwork would make a
contribution to the better understanding of prehistoric and historic settlement in the area.
Two research problems are presented below.
There is little potential of finding prehistoric or historic archaeological
sites in the Low Branch floodplain since it is subject to periodic flooding,
but the creek’s terraces may have potential due to its elevation above
flooding.
Historic residences may be present along the roadway above flooding that the
pipeline route parallels.
An even more basic, research problem guided the survey; simply stated the question
asked, “How did past people use the land, and what record of this use did they leave
behind?”
Most frequently, small-scale surveys of this type gather information in response to this
more open-ended research question, which guides almost all archaeological surveys.
Methodology
The surveyor, armed with plats of the survey area and USGS and soil maps, walked the
proposed pipeline. Shovel testing was done on a judgmental basis in the upland area
away from Low Branch as suggested by the Council of Texas Archeologists and adopted
by the Texas Historical Commission (2002). Shovel tests were excavated to
approximately 30 centimeters below the surface. The clay matrices were broken manually
and visually examined for cultural materials as were the pit walls. Areas with greater than
30 percent ground visibility and that had been mechanically disturbed were not shovel
tested. Notes on the terrain, vegetation and other relevant material were made and
photographs were taken.
Backhoe trenches were not excavated on both banks of Low Branch due to the removal
of the terraces from prior pipeline construction and the unlikelihood of buried cultural
deposits being present north and south of the drainage.

RESULTS
The results section is divided into various parts. The survey area described first, followed
by a description of the survey and the conclusions portion ends the chapter. Shovel tests
are described specifically in the text and their locations are shown in Figure 4.
Survey area
The terrain ranges from generally level to moderately to slightly steep slowing. The
proposed pipeline route runs through alternating unimproved and mowed pasture.
Vegetation consists mainly of johnson grass, thistle and native grasses (Figure 3) in the
unimproved/mowed pastures. Trees consisting of hackberry and elm are west of the
pipeline route and just prior to where the terrain slopes south to Low Branch. Eye-height
visibility was excellent and ground visibility ranged from less than 10 percent to 100
percent.
Low Branch is approximately 2 m wide and about 0.5 m deep. Clear water was flowing
in a loamy clay substrate (Figure 4). The original creek channel has been disturbed due to
the three pipelines through it. Low Branch east of South Holland Road is about 0.5 m
wide and deep. The terraces along the creek also have been removed due to pipeline
construction.
The survey
Survey began at the intersection of South Holland and North Holland Roads. Shovel test
(hereafter ST) was excavated approximately 120 cm south of the intersection and
uncovered 37 cm of very dark brown (10YR3/2) clay. Shovel test 2 was excavated
approximately 100 m southeast of ST 1 and uncovered about 36 cm of dark brown
(10YR3/3) clay and ST 3 encountered approximately 35 cm of fill when it was placed
about 100 m south of ST 2. The shovel tests were culturally sterile and no cultural
materials were seen on the ground surface from the intersection to ST 3.
From ST 3 to South Holland Road was surveyed only. No shovel tests were excavated
due to the good ground visibility and the ground disturbance. No cultural materials older
than 50 years were seen on the ground surface.
No shovel tests were excavated where the proposed pipeline route parallels and is to be
placed adjacent to South Holland Road (Figure 5). However, two shovel tests (4 and 5)
were excavated outside of and in undisturbed sediments just north of Low Branch. The
setting the shovel tests where the shovel tests were excavated is shown in Figure 6.
Shovel test 4 uncovered 36 cm of very dark grayish-brown (10YR3/2) clay while Shovel
test 5 encountered 35 cm of black (10YR2/1) clay. No cultural materials older than 50
years were seen on the ground surface or uncovered in the two shovel tests.

At the fence seen in the background of Figure 6, the ground drops at about a 45 degree
angle (Figures 7 and 8). At the fence, three pipeline routes emerge and their continuation
across Low Branch has severely disturbed the area; therefore no shovel tests were
excavated. The land rises south from Holland Creek at about a 35 degree angle and the
disturbance from the pipeline continues (Figure 9 and 10); therefore no shovel tests were
excavated.
West of the existing lift station is where the proposed lift station is to be constructed
(Figure 11). This area was intensely investigated for cultural materials but none were
seen on the ground surface. Although there was at least 30 percent ground visibility,
Shovel test 6 was excavated in the center of the lift station tract. The culturally sterile
shovel test uncovered brown (10YR5/3) clay to 36 cm below the ground surface.

Conclusions
No cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface or uncovered
in six shovel tests during the intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed
4,500 feet long force main pipeline route and proposed lift station. The absence of
prehistoric sites may be attributed to removal of any sites along Low Branch due to prior
pipeline construction and the absence of perennial water and low biotic diversity from
east of Low Branch to where the pipeline route begins. The absence of historic sites may
also be a result of prior pipeline construction, apartment complex construction or are
present further back from South Holland Road and but were not seen by the
archaeologist.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are
present along the proposed force main pipeline route and lift station. No evidence of
prehistoric or historic occupation was found. AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted due to the absence of
archaeological sites. We further recommend that construction supervisors be advised that
should buried archaeological materials be uncovered during construction, work should
immediately cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be advised of the discovery. Work should not continue until
discussions with the Texas Historical Commission have been completed.
