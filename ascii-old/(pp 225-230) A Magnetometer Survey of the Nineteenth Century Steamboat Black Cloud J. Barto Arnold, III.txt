NOTES
A MAGNETOMETER SURVEY OF
THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
STEAMBOAT BLACK CLOUD
J. BARTO ARNOLD

III

The river steamboat "Black Cloud", also known as the "Black Crook", was
one of two boats owned by Mr. Joseph Richardson which plied the Trinity
River in the 185Os and 1860s. The other boat was named the "Early B ird" The
identification of the site (41 LB 37) as the wreck of the "Black Cloud’" was
made by J. Frank Richardson, the owner’s son, and other local residents
(Fisher n.d.). An idea of the services and rates of freight and passage is
available from contemporary newspaper advertisements (Fig. 1). The size of
the boat is estimated at about 150 x 45 feet (Prewitt 1973:41). The "Black
Cloud" hit a snag near the old Atascosita Road River Crossing and sank. This
incident seems to have occurred between mid April and early May, 1869. The
last advertisement for the "Black Cloud" in Galveston gave a departure date of
March 30, 1869 (Galveston Daily News, Galveston Triweekly News). These
advertisements had been appearing at intervals indicating a round trip of
approximately one month (Ibid.).
Shortly after the boat sank, the ship’s bell was salvaged by the owner, Mr.
Richardson, transported to Liberty overland with a yoke of oxen, and donated
to the First Methodist Church in whose possession it has remained to this day
(Fisher n.d.). The name of the manufacturer is cast in raised letters on the bell
"G. W. Coffin & Co. Buckeye Bell Foundry Cincinnati". It is a large bell about
two and one-half feet high by two feet in diameter at its mouth and is in a good
state of preservation. The bell is still in use.
The wreck was hit during the laying of a pipeline in October and November,
1965, digging up what was apparently part of the vessel’s stern. When the
laying of another pipeline along the same route was imminent, the precise
location of the boat had to be determined to avoid further damage.

SURVEY
A magnetometer survey was carried out in early January, 1974, by the Texas
Antiquities Committee and sponsored by the Natural Gas Pipeline Company.
The instrument used was a Varian M-50 proton magnetometer with a marine
sensor head.

CONDITION
All accounts indicate that the artifacts recovered in 1965, both iron and
wood, were in a good state of preservation. Local legend has it that a boiler
embedded in the opposite bank of the river came from this site, but there is
nevertheless a substantial and fairly concentrated anomaly adjacent to the

The orientation of the wreck can be speculated upon since part of the stern
wheel was reportedly among the artifacts plundered from the site in 1965
(Illustrated Press of Liberty County, Nov. 1965). This fact in combination with
the magnetic data (Fig. 2) indicates that the boat lay roughly parallel to the
bank with the stern downstream to the south and the bow upstream to the
north. The area of reduced magnetic distortion in the left center of Fig. 2
probably represents the part of the wreck disturbed by the laying of the
pipeline. The survey also indicated that there is some widely scattered debris
downstream from the site concentrated in the part of the river adjacent to the
western bank. The main anomaly is approximately 75 feet long and this may
in fact correspond more accurately to the boat’s actual length than the estimated figures given above depending upon how much of the site was disrupted by the laying of the original pipeline.

CONCLUSIONS
The magnetic data indicate that the remains of the "Black Cloud" are fairly
concentrated. This is an important site which should be protected, and the
public-spirited attitude of the Natural Gas Pipeline Company in cooperating
in the magnetometer survey and rerouting the pipeline to avoid further
destruction is most commendable.
The advisability of large scale excavation of the site is questionable at this
time for a number of reasons:
1. The site has been disrupted to an unknown extent.
2. The boat was bound downstream when it sank. The cargo would
therefore have been agricultural products rather than the perhaps more significant manufactured and luxury goods that would be aboard on the trip
upstream.
3. There was at least s ome attempt to salvage the wreck soon after the boat
sank. It is reasonable to assume that the ship’s bell was not the only item of
value removed from the wreck.
4. Proper excavation and recovery efforts would be tremendously expensive.
In short, there are undoubtedly other wrecks in the rivers of Texas which
would yield better information in return for the investment of the large
amounts of time and money required for an underwater archeological excavation. However, this is not to say that the "Black Cloud" does not warrant our
efforts to protect it. Each archeological site both above and beneath water is a
vital part of the state’s cultural heritage. There is no doubt that there are many
items of ship’s fittings and equipment which would not have been considered
worth removing during salvage efforts in the 1870s. These artifacts are
nevertheless of considerable interest and importance to scholars of today. It
may be that in years to come excavation of this site may become advantageous.
