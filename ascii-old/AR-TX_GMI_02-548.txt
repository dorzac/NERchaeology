MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of the Geo-Marine, Inc., cultural resources monitoring and
testing phases for transmission tower installations along the 39.7-mile, 345-kilovolt Oncor
Electric Delivery Company, LLC, proposed Bell County East to Texas New Mexico Power
(TNP) One double circuit transmission line in Bell, Milam, and Robertson counties in Central
Texas. The line will connect the proposed Bell County East Switching Station located southeast
of the city of Temple to the existing TNP One Switching Station located near State Highway 6
south of the town of Bremond. This monitoring and testing project was the completion phase of
the prior survey investigations of the line by Power Engineers, Inc., and William Self
Associates, Inc., conducted between August 2010 and April 2011. Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted
testing and archeological monitoring for site 41BL1352 as well as monitoring for three sites
(41MM377, 41MM378, and 41MM379) and 27 selected tower locations because they were in
high-probably zones for cultural materials. Four towers were located between Walkers Creek
and Little Pond Creek, five towers were adjacent to Big Briary Creek, and 18 towers were
northeast of the Brazos River. These investigations took place from mid-July through late
October 2011 as specific tower installations were initiated.
Cultural resources monitoring of brush clearing encountered no new information regarding sites
41MM377, 41MM378, and 41MM379 and the brush clearing by hand did not appear to disturb
the deposits at the three sites. Monitoring of 18 auger holes for tower construction within the
Brazos River Holocene Valley indicated a high-energy depositional environment. Although
paleosols were observed within depths penetrated by augering, none of the excavated auger
holes encountered significant cultural resources or deposits. Nonetheless, since these auger
holes represented such a small sample of the alluvial valley, the results do not disprove the
potential for deeply buried archeological sites within the valley nor the need for monitoring or
deep testing in this area of the valley if the necessity arises. Monitoring between Walkers and
Little Pond creeks indicated that Holocene soils are shallow and no buried paleosols were
observed resulting in minimal potential for buried resources. Though only one flake was found
in the Holocene soils on Big Briary Creek, the potential for buried resources here are much
greater.

Testing at site 41BL1352 yielded a high density and wide variety of prehistoric artifacts, but the
presence of a Transitional Archaic Darl dart point found clearly below two Early Archaic dart
points was evidence of inverted stratigraphy and indicated that the deposits at the site retain little
integrity. Additionally, an intact historic trash pit feature was encountered, but archival
investigations and a conversation with the landowner failed to reveal data pertinent to National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility or State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
designation. Nonetheless, site 41BL1352 has not been fully assessed since it extends beyond the
current project right-of-way, so it was recommended as of unknown NRHP eligibility or SAL
designation. However, the portion of the site within the right-of-way would not contribute to the
siteâs NRHP eligibility if it were later determined eligible, and therefore no further work was
required at site 41BL1352 within the right-of-way. The results of the subsequent monitoring did
not change the recommendations of unknown eligibility for site 41BL1352.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The monitoring and testing conducted for this project could not have been completed without the
participation and support of many people. First and foremost is Tom Yank at Oncor who offered
much support and guidance throughout the project and helped with coordination between GeoMarine and Oncor support personnel. Steve Middleton at Oncor provided access to properties
and mediated coordination of field schedules with all parties involved in the project. Eric
Morales at Oncor provided access and coordination to properties where monitoring of brush
clearing was conducted. Finally, the staff members at Kleinfelder Engineering, particularly
Brandon Barefoot, went above and beyond their job obligations to ensure that Geo-Marine
personnel were continuously aware of the status of the drilling operations. These efforts were
greatly appreciated.
At Geo-Marine, Melissa Green, Principal Investigator, provided insight and advice throughout the
duration of the project. The field crew, Lindsey Skelton, Teresa Nugent, and Collin Rucker,
suffered through one of the hottest and driest weeks of the summer to complete testing
excavations in a short period of timeï¾their enthusiasm was greatly appreciated. Special thanks
to Steve Hunt and Lindsey Skelton for the lab responsibilities and preparing all materials for
analysis and curation. The production of the graphics in the report by Erin King is greatly
appreciated. Sharlene Allday did double-duty as a coauthor and editor of the report, and Denise
Pembertonâs formatting and production expertise in making the report visually pleasing and easy
to read was invaluable.
Finally, the authors assume the final responsibility for any omissions and/or mistakes in this

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report presents the results of the Geo-Marine, Inc., cultural resources testing and monitoring
phases for transmission tower installations along the 39.7-mile, 345-kilovolt (kV) Oncor Electric
Delivery Company, LLC (Oncor), proposed Bell County East to Texas New Mexico Power
(TNP) One double circuit transmission line in Bell, Milam, and Robertson counties in Central
Texas. The line will connect the proposed Bell County East Switching Station located southeast
of the city of Temple to the existing TNP One Switching Station located near State Highway (SH)
6 south of the town of Bremond (Figure 1). Transmission towers to be installed along the length
of the line average an approximate distance of 345 meters (m; 1,132 feet [ft]) from each other
(Figures 2â5).
Power Engineers, Inc., and William Self Associates, Inc., conducted the previous survey
investigations between August 2010 and April 2011, identifying six new archeological sites
(Karbula and Black 2011). In addition, recommendations were made for archeological
monitoring of selected areas and at sites recommended to be of unknown or undetermined
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility if avoidance was not possible during
construction.
Just prior to construction, Oncor contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (Geo-Marine project number
30682.00.01), to conduct archeological monitoring at 27 locations to be impacted by tower
support drilling and at three previously recorded archeological sites (41MM377, 41MM378, and
41MM379) to be impacted by right-of-way (ROW) brush clearing. Four towers were located
between Walkers Creek and Little Pond Creek, five towers were adjacent to Big Briary Creek,
and 18 towers were northeast of the Brazos River. Although monitoring of brush clearing at
41BL1352 also was originally recommended, clearing was unnecessary at 41BL1352 because the
ROW within this site location consisted entirely of an open, grassy pasture. Nonetheless, because
Oncor was unable to relocate the planned position of a tower within the site boundary, formal
eligibility testing for NRHP inclusion and/or State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation
was required prior to ground disturbance activities at this site. Geo-Marine conducted NRHP
testing at 41BL1352 from July 11â15, 2011, and archeological monitoring from August 15, 2011,
to October 24, 2011.

REGIONAL CULTURAL HISTORY

This chapter presents a very brief and very general discussion of Central Texas prehistory and
history (Table 1). Data taken from several regional chronologies (Black 1989; Collins 1995;
Johnson and Goode 1994) form the basis for the discussion of Central Texas prehistoric regional
chronology, which is divided into three basic periodsâPaleoindian, Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric, each further subdivided in the following discussion. The historic chronology is
presented in a brief discussion by county. Additional sources for more in-depth discussions are
provided throughout the chapter.

PREHISTORIC CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY

Paleoindian (10,000â6800 B.C.)
Human occupation in Central Texas is generally agreed to have begun during the terminal
Pleistocene. This initial Paleoindian cultural period is dated to approximately 10,000â6800 B.C.
(Black 1989; Collins 1995, 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994). In Central Texas, the Paleoindian
period is divided into Early (10,000â8900 B.C) and Late (8900â6800 B.C.) subperiods. The Early
Paleoindian period is characterized by fluted Clovis projectile points along with prismatic blade
manufacture. Subsistence economy for a highly mobile population during this subperiod appears
to have been diverse and focused on of both megafauna (e.g., mammoth and extinct large bison)
and smaller taxa such as badger, alligator, and moles (Collins et al. 1989), as well as available
vegetal resources. Prominent sites in the region with Early Paleoindian components include the
Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault sites. The Late Paleoindian continued with a
highly mobile mixed hunting-gathering tradition and is characterized by the Folsom and
Plainview point types (Collins 1998). Burned rock features first appear in the Central Texas
archeological record during the Late Paleoindian period (Collins 1995). Sites of note in the
region with Late Paleoindian components include Wilson-Leonard, Golondrina-Barber, and St.
Maryâs Hall.

Archaic (6800 B.C.âA.D. 750)
Johnson and Goodeâs (1994) formulation of the Central Texas Archaic makes use of three
subdivisions: Early Archaic (6800â4000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (4,000â2000 B.C.), and Late
Archaic (2,000 B.C.âA.D. 750) based on point typologies.

Early Archaic (6800â4000 B.C.)
The Early Archaic in Central Texas is most known for its large burned rock midden sites that
commonly constitute multiple tons of fire-cracked rock. Although burned rock middens are first
noted in the Late Paleoindian period for Central Texas, they became a prominent site type by the
Early Archaic. The Early Archaic is generally defined by three projectile point style intervals:
Angostura, Early Split-stem, and Martindale-Uvalde (Johnson and Goode 1994). In addition to
burned rock middens, site types include open campsites (Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, and RichardBeene) and caves (Hallâs Cave). Subsistence evidence for the Early Archaic was varied, with
deer, small animal, fish, and plant bulb being common taxa. Pollen and fluvial geological
evidence suggest that environmental conditions during the period fluctuated between mesic and
xeric conditions (Collins 2004).

Middle Archaic (4000â2000 B.C.)
Bell/Andice/Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan/Travis constitute the three projectile point styles
indicative of the Middle Archaic period (Johnson and Goode 1994). The Bell/Andice/Calf Creek
point technology along with environmental data suggesting mesic conditions are seen by Collins
(1994) as evidence for a focus on bison hunting. However, by the latter portion of the Middle
14

Archaic, environmental conditions appear to have shifted again to being more xeric. The xeric
conditions of the latter Middle Archaic have been correlated with an increase in burned rock
midden deposits, and this association is believed to have been due to a greater reliance upon
tuberous plants such as sotol iris (Johnson and Goode 1994).

Late Archaic (2000 B.C.âA.D. 750)
According to Johnson and Goode (1994), the Late Archaic for Central Texas can be subdivided
into (ascending chronological order) six style intervals:
Bulverde, Pedernales/Kinney,
Lange/Marshall/Williams, Marcos/Montell/Castroville, Ensor/Frio/Fairland, and Darl. The Late
Archaic in Central Texas began with xeric conditions and progressively became more mesic.
Burned rock midden deposits continue to be a significant part of many site assemblages and
actually peak in density during the Pedernales/Kinney interval (Collins 2004). Dart points,
corner-tanged knives, and cylindrical stone pipes are associated with Late Archaic site
assemblages from Central Texas. A mixed hunting-gathering economy of large and small
animals as well as various reliable plants of the region (e.g., stool iris and pecan) became well
developed by the end of the Late Archaic and continued largely unchanged into the early Late
Prehistoric.

Late Prehistoric (A.D. 750â1540)
The Late Prehistoric period of the region is divided into Early (Austin interval) and Late (Toyah
interval) subperiods (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994). The evolution to the Late
Prehistoric period in Central Texas is signaled by the introduction of bow and arrow technology
that occured during the Austin interval. Although the arrow point made its introduction in the
Late Prehistoric, it is initially underrepresented when compared to dart points. The later Toyah
interval of the Late Prehistoric is characterized by the dominance of the arrow point, specifically
the Perdiz type. The constellation of Perdiz arrow points, locally manufactured ceramics, end
scrapers, and prismatic blades is seen as an indication of a focus on large game animals (e.g.,
bison, deer, and antelope). Researchers currently disagree on whether this artifact assemblage
represents a techno-complex (Ricklis 1994) or an actual cultural group (Johnson 1994).

HISTORIC CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY (A.D. 1540â1900)
The Historic period began with the arrival of the first European in the area, Coronadoâs 1540â
1542 expedition to the Plains of CÃ­bola, the High Plains west of the study area (CastaÃ±eda
1554[1904]). Coronadoâs chroniclers and those of later Spanish expeditions (e.g., Posada
1686[1982]) report that the region was occupied by Apacha (Apache) people. Based on Spanish
descriptions of Apache lifewaysâwith limited sedentism and a seasonal round of bison hunting
and foragingâit seems that the Garza and Toyah archeological complexes may represent early
Apache occupations (Boyd 1997). In an alternative interpretation that has not yet gained traction
in the Texas archeological community, Garza and other Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric
assemblages have also been linked to the Wichita (Baugh and Perkins 2008; Roberts and
Bradford 1997).

15

If Garza and/or Toyah indeed represent early Apache occupations, the Apache were the primary
native group in the area until the early to mid-eighteenth century, when nomadic Comanche
hunters arrived from the Great Basin and plains northwest of Texas (Lipscomb 2008). Various
Anglo, French, and Spanish traders maintained commercial relationships with the Apache and
Comanche, but the locations and timing of these interactions are debated; for instance, sites of the
Spanish traders known as comancheros have not been securely identified because âno one is sure
what they should look likeâ (Freeman and Boyd 1997:82). Shoshonean-speaking Comanche
continued their dominant presence in Central Texas until the end of the nineteenth century.

Bell County
Although the Spanish do not seem to have entered what is now Bell County, they explored the
Little River in adjacent present-day Milam County and set up missions along the San Gabriel
River in the eighteenth century. The earliest historical residents of the future Bell County area
were the buffalo-hunting Tonkawa, who transitioned to a horse culture and the use of firearms in
the eighteenth century. However, Lipan Apache, Waco, Anadarko, Kiowa, and Comanche also
hunted and camped by waterways. Most tribes had been driven out by Anglo settlers and
European diseases by the late 1840s (Connor and Odintz 2012).
Anglo settlement in Bell County began in the 1830s when eight families moved to the Little
River. Indian attacks, such as the Comanche attack on Fort Parker in 1836, caused the settlers to
sporadically abandon and reoccupy the area until after the mid 1840s when Indian raids became
less frequent, essentially ending by 1859. Bell County was formed in 1850 and named after Peter
H. Bell, only but assumed its present boundaries in 1860. Nolan Springs was chosen as the
county seat, but was later renamed Belton. By 1850, the population of the county stood at
approximately 660, and by 1860 had risen to 4,800, with the communities of Belton, Aiken, and
Salado, on a stage route from Austin, the only towns. Most of the residents raised cattle and
sheep because an uncertain water supply limited farming. The majority of the county voted in
favor of secession in 1861, and more than 1,000 Bell County men served in the Confederate or
state military.
During the post-Civil War era, the county economy plummeted to half its value, and
Reconstruction brought violence, lawlessness, political feuds, murders, and lynchings. Cotton
and cattle booms, along with the arrival of the first railroad, establishing Temple as a rail center
and the largest town in the county in the late nineteenth century, began to improve the economy.
However, cotton production was decimated by soil depletion, overproduction, and the boll weevil
in the 1920s, resulting in a population loss. Those who remained turned to alternate crops and
poultry production. World War II had a dramatic effect on the county when Fort Hood was
established. The military base brought economic recovery to the county and continues to
function as a major training center. The 2000 census showed 237,974 residents engaged
primarily in manufacturing and agribusiness pursuits (Connor and Odintz 2012).

Milan County
The Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache became neighbors in the present-day Milam County area
sometime after 1300. By the eighteenth century Caddo, Tehuacana, and Waco Indians were also
in the area. The first European exploration of the area that became Milam County took place in
16

1716 as Fr. Isidro Felix de Espinosa and Domingo RamÃ³n crossed the San Gabriel and Little
rivers when the Spanish sent expeditions to discourage French settlement. Between 1746 and
1749, the Spanish established several missions along the San Gabriel River in an effort to
Christianize the Indians, but by the mid-1750s they had abandoned the missions because of
disease and unfriendly Indians. Although the Tonkawa were generally friendly in the eighteenth
and the early nineteenth centuries, the nearby Apache and Comanche remained a constant threat
(Harper and Smyrl 2012).
The first Anglo presence in the area was instigated by Robert Leftwich, who obtained an 1825
colonization grant from Mexico. However, leadership of the colonization effort changed to
Sterling Robertson in 1827, but by 1830 the contract was suspended because of failure to settle
the area. In 1831, the Mexican government transferred the grant to Stephen F. Austin and his
partner, Samuel May Williams. After Austin lost the grant back to Robertson in 1834, actual
settlement of the region began. The Mexican government called the colony the Municipality of
Viesca, but in 1835 the Provisional Government of Texas renamed it the Municipality of Milam,
in honor of Benjamin Rush Milam. At that time, the colony boundaries covered one-sixth of
Texas, âfollowing the Navasota River, turned southwest along the San Antonio Road to the divide
between the Brazos and the Colorado rivers, then northwest to the Comanche Trail, and east back
to the Navasotaâ (Harper and Smyrl 2012), an area from which all or parts of 34 counties would
be derived. By 1850, Milam County had been carved down to its present size. By the time of the
Texas Revolution, the county was sparsely settled, with only the community of Nashville-on-theBrazos and several families along the Brazos and Little rivers. After Texas independence,
families trickled in but were frequently forced to leave by roaming bands of Kickapoo, Lipan,
Kiowa, and others. As the frontier was pushed northward, Indian raids gradually lessened, the
last occurring in 1846. In 1846, Cameron was selected as the permanent county seat, and by 1850
the county population totaled 2,907 (Harper and Smyrl 2012).
Subsistence farming and cattle and hog raising formed the basic economy in the 1850s. As new
people arrived from the southern states, cotton production and the number of slaves increased.
The county voted overwhelmingly for secession, and a majority of the men volunteered for
Confederate military units. Reconstruction brought severe economic decline, and recovery was
slow because of the lack of transportation and the dependence on cotton. The arrival of the
railroads in the 1870s brought economic recovery and an influx of new residents, and by 1900 the
county population reached 39,666 residents. Soil depletion and the Great Depression forced
many residents to seek better employment elsewhere, and many of those that remained turned to
the cattle industry. Lignite mining and the discovery of the Minerva-Rockdale oil field spurred
population growth, reaching 38,104 in 1920, but declining shortly thereafter as other industrial
areas arose in connection with the growth of war industries. The county population throughout
the 1970s continued to slowly decrease, but by 1990 the number of residents rose slightly to
22,946. Although agriculture continues to be an important influence, more than 50 percent of the
work force is employed in professional and related services, manufacturing, and wholesale and
retail trade (Harper and Smyrl 2012).

Robertson County
Prior to the first European arrival in the area that became Robertson County, the Tawakoni,
Tonkawa, and Waco tribes dominated the region, with occasional Comanche, Kiowa, and LipanApache forays into the area for buffalo hunts and raids on enemy villages. Domingo TerÃ¡n de los
17

RÃ­os was likely the first European to enter the area as he passed through en route to Northeast
Texas in 1690. Domingo RamÃ³n crossed the area in 1716 on his was to found Spanish missions
in East Texas. No permanent Spanish settlements were made during this period, even though
occasional groups of priests or soldiers passed through as they journeyed to resupply the East
Texas missions (Hailey and Long 2012).
The first settlers in the area were a group of buffalo hunters who camped at the Brazos crossing of
the Old San Antonio Road in 1822, and six Kentucky families who built a temporary settlement
at the mouth of the Little River in 1823. The same year Sterling C. Robertson and a group of
Tennesseeans representing the Texas Association of Nashville explored the area for eventual
colonization, and Robert Leftwich, acting as agent for the Texas Association, received a Mexican
government contract in 1825 to settle 800 families in an area bound âon the south by the Old San
Antonio Road, on the north by the Comanche Trace, on the east by the Navasota River, and on
the west by the watershed separating the Brazos and Colorado riversâ (Hailey and Long 2012).
In 1826 a party of 30 Tennesseeans under the auspices of the Texas Association established a
camp at the mouth of the Little Brazos. However, leadership of the colonization effort was given
to Sterling Robertson in 1827, but by 1830 the contract was suspended because of failure to settle
the area. In 1831, the Mexican government transferred the grant to Stephen F. Austin and his
partner, Samuel May Williams. In 1834, Austin lost the grant back to Robertson, who worked
tirelessly to bring about actual settlement of the region. During these legal battles, small groups
of colonists arrived in the area. A fort was built by James Dunn in 1832 at a site later known as
Old Cobb Prairie, and the following year the Wheelock settlement was begun. Much of the area
was temporarily abandoned in 1836 during the Texas Revolution (Hailey and Long 2012).
The First Texas Congress established Robertson County in 1837 from portions of Milam, Bexar,
and Nacogdoches counties, naming it in honor of Sterling Robertson. The settlement of Old
Franklin became the county seat. The county assumed it current configuration in 1846 after 16
other counties were taken from its original area. Over the next several years, the county seat was
moved from Old Franklin to Wheelock to Owensville, where it remained until after the Civil
War. During the mid-1830s, Anglo settlers and Indian tribes were in numerous battles, the most
famous of which was the 1836 attack on Fort Parker on the Navasota River (now in Limestone
County but originally part of Robertson County), in which the young 11- or 12-year-old Cynthia
Ann Parker was captured by the Comanche and for nearly 25 years lived with the Indians, âforgot
white ways, and became thoroughly Comanche,â eventually becoming the wife of Peta Nocona
and mother to two sons, Chief Quanah Parker and Pecos, and a daughter, Topsannah (Hacker
2012). After 1838, however, Indian raids became less frequent as the frontier was pushed farther
west and by 1846 were rare (Hailey and Long 2012).
The county population increased very slowly and in 1850 numbered only 934, but as new settlers
arrived because of the fertile Brazos and Navasota river bottomlands had increased to 4,997 by
1860. Most of the immigrants were from the South, bringing their slaves and cotton production
with them, and established a flourishing plantation economy. Based on their Southern heritage,
the county voted overwhelmingly for secession, and residents supported the Confederacy through
military service as well as providing beef and grain to the army and constructing a textile and
flour mill near present-day Hearne. After the war, Reconstruction brought a collapse to the
economy. By the late 1860s, the economy began to recover with the coming of the Houston and
Texas Central Railway, the influx of white farmers from the South attracted by fertile land, and
numbers of former slaves recruited to work as farmhands. In 1878, the county seat was once
again moved, this time to the community of Morgan, on the railroad line near the center of the
18

county, and the town was renamed Franklin in honor of the original seat. In 1880, the
International-Great Northern and the Houston and Texas Central railway linked together at
Hearne, resulting in an important rail center, and together with the rising population, spurring the
agriculture business (Hailey and Long 2012).
By the late nineteenth/early twentieth century, soil depletion, falling cotton prices, and the boll
weevil had affected the economy and population again declined during the Great Depression. By
the start of World War II, however, agricultural demand and prices were up, and the discovery of
oil in 1944 brought additional income. By the 1960s, ranching had begun to replace farming, and
by the 1970s livestock raising had become the focus, dominating the economy by the 1990s, and
along with brick manufacturing, oil and natural gas, and lignite mining, providing income for a
population of 15,511 (Hailey and Long 2012).

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

SITE DESIGNATION
The purpose of tower monitoring was to assure that neither surficial nor deeply buried, unknown
sites would be encountered and affected by support excavations. In the event that additional
cultural materials were encountered during monitoring, the determination of whether the material
constituted a site would be based on several criteria. In general, Geo-Marine defines an
archeological site on the basis of content and extent. If an excavation were to yield subsurface
cultural material, units are excavated in a cruciform pattern at 5-m intervals around the initial
excavation, where right-of-way limits and/or soil conditions permit, until two sterile excavation
units are encountered. For surficial materials, a site is defined as five or more cultural items of at
least two different artifact materials or classes (e.g., prehistoric stone tool manufacturing debris of
different raw materials, or manufacturing debris in combination with stone tools; or for historic
sites, several different historic-era ceramic [or glass] types, or ceramics in addition to glass)
within a 20-m (65.6-ft) square. A site is then defined within the extent of positive excavation
units and/or surface scatter and the data submitted for official site trinomial designation.
Conversely, surface or subsurface individual artifacts or small groups of similar nondiagnostic
artifacts (for example, fewer than five flakes composed of the same material) not meeting the
above site definition criteria are recorded as isolated finds and not assigned a locus number or
considered for listing in the NRHP.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

National Register of Historic Places
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria (36 CFR [Code of Federal Regulations] Part 60.4 [aâd]) for evaluating
properties for inclusion in the National Register are codified under the authority of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation has set forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Based on Advisory
21

Council guidelines, any resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National
Register is a âhistoric property.â Federal regulations state that âThe term âeligible for inclusion in
the National Registerâ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of
the Interior and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteriaâ (36 CFR Â§800.2
[e]). Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions,
the following four criteria for eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR
Part 60.4 (aâd)].

The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses
the potential to contribute to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Therefore, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from both archeological and,
if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because
research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design,
determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly
important objective during the inventory process. The objective of this current project was to
locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe
those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.

State Archeological Landmark
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) is responsible for designating a resource as a State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) under Antiquities Code of Texas criteria (THC 1997). At issue,
however, is whether a site meeting those criteria is significant and eligible for designation as an
SAL or for inclusion in the National Register. Listing in the National Register is a prerequisite
for a building to be designated as an SAL. Archeological sites may be considered significant at
the state level and be recognized or designated as an SAL provided that at least one of the
following conditions is met:
(1) The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
(2) The archeological site is situated on private lands that have been specifically designated as an
SAL . . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the siteâs original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
22

(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter
41.7, Antiquities Code of Texas].

SAL designation encourages preservation and ensures that a property is at least documented if it
cannot be preserved (THC 1997). An SAL designation for a site on privately owned land must
have the written consent of the landowner and is recorded in the county deed records; this
designation is conveyed with the property when sold:
(a) Any site located on private land which is determined by majority vote of the committee to be of
sufficient archeological, scientific, or historical significance to scientific study, interest, or public
representation of the aboriginal or historical past of Texas may be designated a state
archeological landmark by the committee.
(b) No site may be designated on private land without the written consent of the landowner or
landowners in recordable form sufficiently describing the site so that it may be located on the
ground.
(c) On designation, the consent of the landowner shall be recorded in the deed records of the county
in which the land is located [âDesignating a Landmark on Private Landâ; Title 9, Chapter 191,
Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094].

SECTION II: NRHP ELIGIBILITY TESTING:
SITE 41BL1352

CHAPTER 4
SITE 41BL1352 NRHP TESTING METHODS

FIELD METHODS
As part of the monitoring phase for the Bell County East to TNP One 345 kV transmission line
installation, Geo-Marine, Inc., personnel conducted Phase II testing at site 41BL1352, situated
approximately 20 miles southeast of the city of Temple, in southeastern Bell County, Texas, in
July 2011. The Phase II testing was undertaken near the center of the site where an Oncor tower
was to be installed (Figure 6). Due to the intervals between the towers, the planned location of
the tower fell in the center of the site, and Oncor was unable to relocate the tower at a great
enough distance to the east or west to avoid construction within the site boundary. As a result,
formal testing to determine eligibility for NRHP inclusion and/or SAL designation was required
prior to ground disturbance activities at the site. This work was conducted from July 11â15,
2011.
The testing plan was focused primarily on examining the portions of the site where maximum
construction impacts would occur. At the same time, it was necessary to place the excavation
units at a safe enough distance from the tower location to ensure that the structural integrity of the
deposits adjacent to the tower location was not compromised for Oncorâs purposes. As a result, a
150-ft (46-m) arbitrary buffer âimpact zoneâ was placed around the proposed tower location and
was subdivided into four cardinal direction quadrants (Figure 7). Initially, the testing plan was to
consist of the placement of a single 0.50-x-0.50-m (1.6-x-1.6-ft) test unit within each of the four
quadrants and then several 0.50-x-0.50-m (test units at the outskirts of the site boundary. The
option to expand the units into 1-x-1-m (3.3-x-3.3-ft) units was to be dictated by the findings in
the 0.50-x-0.50-m units.
Test Unit (TU) 1 was a 0.50-x-0.50-m test unit excavated in the northwest quadrant of the impact
zone on the northern promontory of the terrace, and TU 2 was a 0.50-x-0.50-m test unit excavated
in the southwest quadrant of the impact zone on the broad, level portion of the terrace. Although
artifact counts were fairly sparse in these initial test units, the presence of a projectile point base
and fire-cracked rock (FCR) below the plowzone prompted the expansion of TUs 3 and 4 into 1Â­
x-1-m units. These test units were excavated in the northeastern and southeastern quadrants,
respectively. Based on the findings in TUs 1â4, it was determined that the additional units
originally planned at the outskirts of the site boundary were unlikely to contribute additional

information to the siteâs eligibility determination. As a result, excavations were terminated upon
completion of TUs 1â4. Below, a description of the environmental setting observed at the site is
presented, followed by a brief background on the previous investigations at the site. The detailed
results of the investigations then follow with the prehistoric and historic artifact assemblages, as
well as the collected faunal remains, presented separately.

ARTIFACT TREATMENT AND ANALYSIS
All artifacts recovered from shovel tests, as well as select artifacts from surface scatters, were
briefly examined, bagged, and labeled by provenience in the field. Upon arrival at the GeoMarine laboratory facilities in Plano, Texas, artifacts were inventoried, cleaned, analyzed, and
catalogued (Appendix A). Each artifact was thoroughly examined in order to identify and
determine, to the extent possible, its function or role and cultural or chronological affiliation
within the identified contexts.

Prehistoric Cultural Material
The prehistoric artifacts all fell within lithic artifact classes. Analysis detailed enough to
categorize items as biface, uniface, edge-modified flake, unmodified debitage,
ground/pecked/battered stone, and unworked stone was conducted at the laboratory at GeoÂ­
28

Marine (see Appendix A). For each artifact, raw material was identified when possible, the size
based on US Geological Survey (USGS) size grades was taken, and the weight in grams (g) was
noted. All of these attributes were recorded and entered into an ACCESS database.

Chipped Stone

Finished Biface
Finished bifaces are those finely worked stone pieces in which the manufacturing process has
apparently been brought to completion, as evidenced by secondary retouch, edge straightening,
hafting preparation, notching, and similar characteristics. Eleven subcategories are recognized:
(1) Dart point; (2) Arrow point; (3) Indeterminate point; (4) Axe; (5) Thinned biface (knife); (6)
Chopper; (7) Drill; (8) Adze/Gouge; (9) Marginal biface retouch; (10) Indeterminate biface, and
(11) Gunflint. These tools are further divided into a number of subcategories: (1) Complete; (2)
Tip; (3) Midsection; (4) Base/stem; (5) Longitudinal fracture; (6) Tang; (7) Blade; (8)
Proximal/Medial;(9) Distal/Medial; and (10) Indeterminate fragment.

Unfinished Biface
Unfinished bifaces are those in which the manufacturing process has not been brought to
completion. These artifacts tend to be somewhat crude, lacking the fine workmanship of finished
tools. Five subcategories are recognized: (1) Aborted, Early; (2) Aborted, Late; (3) Arrow point
preform; (4) Dart point preform; and (5) Unidentified fragment. Unfinished bifaces are further
categorized as complete or fragment.

Uniface
Unifaces are tools that exhibit flake scars on one face only. Fifteen basic subtypes have been
identified: (1) Marginal modified/retouched uniface; (2) Borer; (3) Burin; (4) Denticulate; (5)
End scraper; (6) Side scraper; (7) Scraper with Graver spur; (8) Graver; (9) Notch; (10) Burin
spall; (11) Adze/Gouge; (12) Circular scraper; (13) Gossett uniface; (14) End/Side scraper; and
(15) Indeterminate. These categories are further distinguished by whether the specimen is
complete or fragmentary.

Edge-modified Flake
Edge-modified flakes exhibit discontinuous retouch or very abrupt retouch of an edge, often on
both faces, which, if caused by human activity and not acts of nature or by animals, likely reflects
modification through use, rather than intentional, formal modification. Edge-modified flakes
were classified as expedient tools (i.e., reflecting human modification) if exhibiting more than
one edge or an entire edge (as opposed to a very small area) with modification. The 11 categories
recognized are the same as for unmodified debitage.

30

Unmodified Debitage
Unmodified debitage is the unused debris resulting from lithic reduction processes; it usually
takes the form of flakes, which must exhibit a platform and a bulb of percussion, and
nondiagnostic shatter. Debitage may be further distinguished by the amount of cortex remaining
on the piece. A total of 11 subcategories is recognized: (1) Primary Decortication Flake, 75
percent cortex; (2) Secondary Decortication Flake, less than 75 percent cortex; (3) Tertiary Flake,
no cortex; (4) Biface thinning flake; (5) Angular shatter; (6) Platform-bearing remnant; (7) Thin
flake fragment; (8) Distal flake fragment; (9) Blade; (10) Blade fragment; and (11) Not
applicable.

Core
A core is a cobble or mass of lithic material exhibiting scars that result from the systematic
removal of flakes by human activity. Four subcategories of cores are recognized: (1) Tested
pebble/nodule; (2) Complete core; (3) Fragment/indeterminate; and (4) Exhausted core. Cores
are further subdivided into morphological and technological categories: (1) Bipolar; (2)
Discoidal; (3) Multidirectional; (4) Unidirectional; and (5) Not applicable.

Ground/Pecked/Battered Stone
The ground/pecked/battered stone artifact class includes those specimens that have been modified
by grinding, pecking, or battering or any combination of the three processes. Seventeen
subcategories, divided further into complete and fragmentary pieces, are recognized: (1)
Abrader; (2) Anvil; (3) Celt; (4) Hammerstone; (5) Incised Stone; (6) Mano; (7)
Mano/hammerstone; (8) Metate/grinding slab; (9) Pendant/gorget; (10) Polished Stone; (11)
Smoothed Stone; (12) Sinker (fishing weight); (13) Bead; (14) Multi-purpose; (15) Atlatl
weight/bannerstone; (16) Mano/metate; and (17) Stone hoe.

Unworked Stone
Unworked stone refers to materials at a site that, although not formally or directly utilized or
modified by humans, have nevertheless been affected by human activity. Three formal
subcategories are recognized: (1) Manuport cobble (i.e., not natural to site context, but brought
onsite); (2) Burned or Fire-cracked Rock (FCR); and (3) Ochre. An additional category, Not
Applicable, is included for those materials that do not fit into these categories.

Historic Cultural Material
The analysis of the historical material made use of four major analytical categories of artifacts
based on South (1977), consisting of four major functional categoriesâ(1) Domestic (which
includes Furnishings), (2) Architectural, (3) Personal, and (4) Activitiesâand a minor category of
(5) Indeterminate when function cannot be established.

31

The four major artifact categoriesâDomestic/Furnishings, Architectural, Personal, Activitiesâare
divided into various subcategories. These subcategories are then subdivided into various classes,
types, and subtypes, depending on the type of subcategory and material type. In the case of
ceramics and glass, these subtypes are associated with manufacture or use dates whenever possible.
The final category aboveâIndeterminateâis reserved for unidentifiable metal, ceramic, and glass
fragments (e.g., pieces of thin metal, burned/melted glass globules, etc.) that are unclassifiable as to
category or function.
Domestic
The Domestic category includes artifacts related to food service (i.e., tableware and food storage,
including food preparation), metal, ceramics, and glass items associated with plates, serving pieces,
glass containers, cooking pots, etc. The Furnishings subcategory includes all nonfood service- or
nonfood storage-related household items such as furniture, stove, and lamp and table glass or
ceramic vase or figurine. An âUnidentified Domesticâ subcategory subsumes the remainder of the
food-related items such as bone and shell. It should be noted that not all ceramics or glass artifacts
fall within the Domestic category; in some cases, artifacts of these materials belong within the
Architectural (e.g., window glass) or Activities (e.g., electrical insulators) categories.
Architectural
The Architectural category includes all items that could be related to buildings or structures, such as
window glass, nails, brick, mortar and/or plaster, and ceramic tile or pipe.

Personal
The Personal category includes items of individual use such as clothing, buttons, shoes, doll parts,
cosmetic bottles, snuff bottles (identified on the basis of characteristics such as glass color, bottle
shape, and lip shape), musical instruments, and smoking pipes.

Activities
The final functional categoryâActivitiesâincludes all nonhousehold items such as those
associated with transportation and farm-related equipment. Activities category items include truck
or tractor parts, harness buckles, fence staples, fence wire, horseshoes or horseshoe nails, and
firearms/weapons parts and cartridges. As with Personal items, the Activities category often makes
up only a small proportion of the overall assemblage of identifiable historical artifacts from a site.

Faunal and Vegetal Material
Faunal bone and vegetal remains are categorized by class (animal bone, shell, or vegetal) and
analyzed for taphonomic characteristics and type (burned/unburned, worked/unworked, and
vegetal type [e.g., wood charcoal]). When possible, each specimen is identified to species level
or to at least bone type and animal/size (e.g., long bone fragment, medium-large mammal, etc.).
Any indications of calcination and/or human modification are noted and described.

CHAPTER 5
SITE ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING AND PREVIOUS
INVESTIGATIONS

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Site 41BL1352 is situated on a high terrace overlooking the confluence of Big Elm Creek and
Camp Creek to the northeast. The soils at the site and in similar topographic locations in the
region are mapped as the Branyon series, which consists of very deep, moderately well-drained,
very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey sediments (NRCS 2011). Branyon
soils are characterized as fine, smectitic, thermic Udic Haplusterts and are grouped under the
Vertisol soil order. As a suborder of Vertisols, the Usterts defining characteristic is the presence
of cracks developed over at least 90 cumulative days per year (Buol et al. 2003). These cracks,
which form during the dry season due to shrinking of the clay matrix, can range from 2.5â7.6 cm
(1â3 in) in width, extending from the ground surface to depths of 1 m (3.3 ft) or greater (Buol et
al. 2003). Through numerous processes such as wind, water, and animal activity, sediments enter
the cracks and are incorporated into the subsurface. Upon rewetting of the soil, this added
material expands, causing masses of soil to slide over another to produce slickensides (Duffield
1970). In addition, this contraction-expansion characteristic of Vertisols can cause upwelling of
masses of clay, forming an undulating surface called gilgai topography. In archeological
contexts, these processes can have such detrimental effects on the integrity of archeological
deposits as translocating artifacts, differentially modifying soil horizon depths, and blurring
occupation zones. Because eastern Central Texas is known to contain some of the most extensive
Vertisols in the United States (Holliday 2004:277), the effects of these processes must be
considered when interpreting sites in this region (Figure 8).

The previous Phase I archeological survey conducted at the site when it was initially discovered
consisted of the excavation of 12 shovel tests, seven of which yielded cultural materials (Karbula
and Black 2011). The assemblage totaled 202 artifacts and consisted of a wide variety of cultural
materials that included both historic and prehistoric materials. The historic assemblage was
sparse, consisting of only eight fragments of ceramics and glass recovered strictly from the
ground surface and within the plowzone. The prehistoric assemblage, on the other hand, was
dense and highly variable and included bifaces, hammerstones, debitage, expedient tools,

preforms, projectile points, and FCR. The presence of FCR indicated that intact hearth features
could be present below the plowzone. Although a portion of the prehistoric assemblage was
found intermixed with historic materials on the ground surface and within the plowzone, a
definitive presence of prehistoric materials was consistently found below the plowzone at depths
ranging from 50â70 cmbs. The thickest portion of the prehistoric component was found on the
northeast promontory of the terrace but thinned farther to the northeast and to the south and west.

CHAPTER 6
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Four test units were excavated at site 41BL1352. TUs 1 and 2 were both 0.50-x-0.50-m units and
TUs 3 and 4 were 1-x-1-m units. All test units were excavated in arbitrary 10-cm levels to depths
ranging from 80â140 cmbs. These units yielded primarily prehistoric material. Artifacts were
recovered variously from depths ranging from the surface to 140 cmbs. Projectile point dates and
types are based on Turner and Hester (1999).

TEST UNIT 1
TU 1 was a 0.50-x-0.50-m unit excavated in the northwest quadrant of the impact zone on the
northern promontory of the terrace. The unit consisted of very compact, very dark gray (10YR
3/1) clay between 0 and 60 cmbs and very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay with grayish brown mottles
(10YR 5/2) with common calcium carbonate threads between 60 and 80 cmbs (Figure 9). The
upper 30 cmbs exhibited a granular structure consistent with a plowzone, whereas slickenslides
were common between 30 and 80 cmbs. Extensive cracking was observed throughout all depths
excavated within the test unit and appeared to extend much deeper. Numerous pieces of debitage
were observed at random orientations within the cracks, indicating that an unknown proportion of
the recovered artifacts was not in primary context.
Cultural materials retrieved from TU 1 consisted of lithics (0â70 cmbs), historic artifacts (0â40
cmbs), and a limited amount of mussel shell fragments (0â10 and 60â70 cmbs; see âFaunal
Remainsâ discussion at the end of this chapter).

Prehistoric Artifact Assemblage
TU 1 yielded 45 prehistoric lithics from 0â70 cmbs (Table 2). The upper 30 cm was clearly
represented by the plowzone because a mixture of historic and prehistoric artifacts was recovered.
Approximately half of the prehistoric materials were recovered from the plowzone (n=21; 47
percent). The remainder of the prehistoric materials was found sparsely scattered between 30 and
70 cmbs with no observable pattern in artifact distributions. The unit was terminated at 80 cmbs
because no cultural materials were found between 70 and 80 cmbs, at the onset of subsoil. The
prehistoric cultural assemblage consists primarily of debitage; only three stone tools were found.

Among the three lithic tools in the unit is one very small Edwards chert projectile point fragment
found at 30â40 cmbs. The stem and base of this small arrow point (Field Specimen [FS] 5/1) is
broken at the likely stem/blade junction; the stem has straight lateral edges and a sharply convex
base, suggesting a Late Prehistoric Perdiz-like point fragment (Figure 10). A single piece of
Edwards chert shatter (40â50 cmbs) shows minimal edge modification (FS 6/4). A small,
triangular, very thin, fragment of Edwards chert appears to be a dart point preform (60â70 cmbs)
with medial and lateral breaks across the blade; one face is well flaked (FS 8/1).

The majority of the lithics class, however, is unmodified debitage: 46 percent pieces of shatter
and 24 percent tertiary flakes, followed by 11 percent thin flake fragments, 8 percent biface
thinning flakes, 5 percent distal flake fragments, 2 percent each of platform-bearing remnants and
secondary flakes. Raw material observed among the assemblage consists of predominantly
Edwards chert (78 percent), with minor amounts of Ogallala quartzite (14 percent), and
fossiliferous chert, jasper, and quartzite (3 percent each). Most of the debitage shows no
indication of thermal alteration, but four pieces of shatter appear to have been heat-treated. The
debitage primarily falls into the 12.5â19-mm size range (41 percent). Five pieces of FCR (13.7
grams [g]) were scattered throughout the depth of the unit from 20â70 cmbs.

Historic Artifact Assemblage
Among the limited historic materials from TU 1 are three brick fragments (post-1903), classified
as Architectural building material, from the upper 10 cmbs (Table 3). Ceramics consist of one
Domestic porcelain (bluish gray glaze) fragment of indeterminate age. Glass fragments are
composed of Domestic clear (post-1880; 0â10 cmbs) and light green (20â30 cmbs) sherds, as
well as an angular, clear glass fragment (post-1880) of Indeterminate function also collected from
20â30 cmbs. Wire nails (post-1890) comprise the metal items.

TEST UNIT 2
TU 2 was a 0.50-x-0.50-m test unit excavated in the southwest quadrant of the impact zone on the
broad, level portion of the terrace (Figure 11). The soils encountered within TU 2 were similar to
TU 1, but artifact counts were noticeably lower, yielding only 19 lithics from 10â90 cmbs (Table
4 ).

The assemblage consists entirely of lithics, primarily unmodified debitage found in relatively
equal amounts in all levels except between 50 and 70 cmbs, from which no chipped stone
artifacts were recovered. Four pieces of FCR and one possible mano/hammerstone complete the
artifact assemblage from TU 2. No historic, faunal, or vegetal material was recovered from this
unit.
The outer face of a large, heat-fractured quartzite cobble fragment appears to have possibly been
smoothed and polished with one end potentially battered, perhaps used as a mano/hammerstone
tool. The internal fractured faces show intense thermal alteration. The fragment was collected
from the 60â70 cmbs level.
The 14 pieces of debitage consist of distal flake fragments (29 percent), a secondary flake (7
percent), and tertiary flakes (14 percent), but pieces of shatter (50 percent) comprise most of the
assemblage. Debitage was found from 10â50 cmbs and 70â80 cmbs. Edwards chert was noted
as the primary raw material (86 percent), with small amounts of fossiliferous chert and quartzite
(7 percent each). The majority of the flakes falls into the 19â25- and 25â51-mm (29 percent
each) size ranges. Five pieces of debitage appear to have been heat-treated. The four pieces of
FCR (35.4 g) came from 10â60 cmbs.

TEST UNIT 3
TU 3 was a 1-x-1-m test unit excavated in the northeast quadrant of the impact zone on the
northern promontory of the terrace. Just below the surface, the unit consisted of very dark gray
(10YR 3/1) clay in the southern half of the unit and brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) clay with
abundant very dark gray (10YR 3/1) earthworm castings in the northern half. It was initially
unclear as to why the brownish yellow clay, consistent with the typically underlying B horizon,
was present just below the ground surface. It was obvious that some type of soil disturbance had
occurred, but it was not until an ash layer associated with numerous historic-age artifacts was
encountered at approximately 28 cmbs (Figure 12) that it became apparent that the feature
represented a historic trash pit and that the brownish yellow clay represented pit fill. Deeper
excavation revealed that the test unit had encountered the southwestern portion of the trash pit as
the pit fill narrowed to the northeast with depth (Figure 13). The base of the trash pit within the
confines of the test unit was encountered at approximately 120 cmbs in the northeast quadrant.
Outside of the pit feature, the matrix consisted of very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay between 0 and
100 cmbs, over light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) clay mottled brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) and very
dark gray (10YR 3/1) with many calcium carbonate nodules between 100 and 120 cmbs, and
brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) clay with many calcium carbonate nodules between 120 and 140
cmbs. With artifact counts dropping significantly in the lowest levels and the onset of subsoil, the
unit was terminated at 140 cmbs. Aside from 11 pieces of debitage and an edge-modified flake
found within the historic feature fill, the prehistoric materials described below were recovered
from darker sediments clearly separate from the feature fill. The 12 prehistoric artifacts
recovered from the feature fill likely fell into cracks from the surface.
Cultural material from this test unit was composed overwhelmingly of lithic artifacts, with
historic materials accounting for less than 20 percent. In addition to these artifacts, animal bone
and mussel shell fragments were recovered throughout the depth of the unit (see discussion on

âFaunal Remainsâ at the end of this chapter). A total of seven chunks of charcoal was recovered
from TU 3. Five chunks were found within the upper 20 cm of the plowzone and two chunks
were found between 40 and 50 cmbs within the historic trash pit feature. It is likely that all of the
charcoal originates from the trash pit, because the top of the ash layer appears to have been
disturbed during previous plowing of the field.

Prehistoric Artifact Assemblage
The majority of the prehistoric lithic materials at the site came from TU 3. Projectile points,
chipped stone tools, ground stone, unmodified debitage and cores, as well as FCR were retrieved
from 0â130 cmbs (Table 5).

*28â40 cmbs represents prehistoric materials recovered from the historic trash pit feature

Ten projectile points/fragments were recovered from TU 3 from 0â100 cmbs. The three from 0â
10 cmbs are a cultural mix of a dart point and an arrow point, as well as an untyped indeterminate
projectile point fragment. A large, contracting-stem, dart point fragment of Edwards chert (FS
17/1) has a slightly convex base and is well made. The break appears to be at the blade/stem
junction. Based on the stem morphology, the fragment most likely represents a point similar to
the Transitional Archaic Gary type (Figure 14). A very small arrow point blade made on a flake
(FS 17/4) shows flaking across the entire face, but the opposite face is flaked only along lateral
edges. A slightly oblique fracture across the jasper blade removed the proximal portion of the
point (Figure 15). The tip of a small, indeterminate finished biface (FS 17/3) of Edwards chert
exhibits an oblique break across the blade (Figure 16). Although the fragment most likely
represents a small dart point, it could also be part of a very large arrow point.

Two untyped arrow points were found in the 10â20-cmbs level. A small Edwards chert arrow
point blade (FS 18/1) was broken at the stem/blade junction just below the one extant tang. The
blade is narrow and recurved, with edge retouch along both edges (Figure 17). A second small
untyped arrow point (FS 18/2) was broken across the blade distal to the stem/blade junction; the
Edwards chert fragment, possibly heat-treated, is very well made, with an oblique break across
the triangular-shaped blade (Figure 18).

The 20â30-cmbs level yielded a projectile point fragment (FS 19/1). Missing roughly the distal
half and tip of the slender blade as well as one shoulder, the blade exhibits an extant flared
prominent shoulder that angles toward both the stem on the proximal edge and toward the blade
on the distal edge. The sharply contracting, almost nonexistent stem (approximately 3.75 mm in
43

length) ends in a point. The Tecovas jasper point is extremely thin with minimal edge retouch
and an oblique break across the blade (Figure 19). The point morphology most closely resembles
the Late Prehistoric Cliffton arrow point type.

An untyped dart point distal blade/tip fragment (FS 35/1) of Edwards chert (recovered from 60â
70 cmbs) exhibits a very narrow blade with serrated lateral edges. The blade maintains the
relatively same thickness until near the tip, at which point the more convex face angles sharply to
the tip, to adjoin the opposite very flat face. Slight lateral edge beveling is noted on the more
convex face (Figure 20).
The 70â80-cmbs level yielded the stem and proximal blade fragment of an Early Archaic Nolan
dart point (FS 24/1). Of Edwards chert, the blade edges are relatively straight with alternate
beveling; the stem is slightly flaring with alternately beveled edges and a nearly straight base.
Slight shoulders are above the long stem (Figure 21). An almost straight break across the blade
removed part of a lateral edge and the distal portion of the blade.
A small untyped stem/medial dart point fragment from 80â90 cmbs is missing the distal blade
and tip (FS 25/1). The Edwards chert point is poorly made with little edge retouch and large
flake scars across both faces. The blade, with rather straight lateral edges, is strongly shouldered;
the stem is straight on one lateral edge, but expanding on the opposite edge; and the base is
relatively straight (Figure 22).

A rather crudely made dart point of heat-treated Edwards chert has weak shoulders, a slightly
expanding stem with ground edges, and a concave base (FS 26/1). The blade exhibits alternate
beveling on the lateral edges. Based on the general morphology, this point, recovered from the
90â100-cmbs level, is typed as a Transitional Archaic Darl point. A significant step fracture is
noted on one face distal to the shoulder between the blade midline and the lateral edge (Figure
23). The presence of a Transitional Archaic Darl point approximately 20 cm below the Early
Archaic Nolan point is clear evidence that significant post-depositional mixing has occurred at
the site (see âDiscussionâ section in the following chapter).
In addition to the above projectile points, nine chipped stone tools were found in the unit. A
relatively thin, apparently finished, indeterminate biface of Edwards chert (FS 17/8) is an unusual
oval-shaped bifacial tool with both faces flaked and all edges thinned except for an area on one
small thicker broken edge. All the thinned edges appear to be battered and blunted. Its true
function is unknown, although it is possible that it could have been used as some sort of chopper
(Figure 24); this specimen was recovered from the upper 10 cm of the unit. A small unstemmed
dart point preform of Edwards chert from the upper 10 cm has a slightly concave, thinned base
and symmetrical recurved lateral edges (FS 17/2); both faces on one lateral edge exhibit step
fractures, likely the reason for abandonment. Two late aborted biface fragments were also found.
One very large, very thin biface fragment (FS 22/1) from the 50â60 cmbs level is well flaked on
one face but exhibits large gross flake scars on the opposite face; the extant tip with a small patch
of cortex is rather thick. The other late aborted biface (FS 23/1; 60â70 cmbs) is a tip fragment
with one thick lateral edge and the opposite edge relatively thin. Four small unidentified biface
fragments of Edwards chert were collected: three from the 0â10-cmbs level (FSs 17/5â17/7), and
one from the 10â20-cmbs level (FS 18/44). A single uniface from 10â20 cmbs (FS 18/3) is a
large secondary flake with the entire length of the edge opposite the cortex flaked into a series of
small notches, with at least two rows of internal flaking within the notches (Figure 25).

An end fragment of an Edwards chert cobble from 90â100 cmbs (FS 26/3) is roughly triangular;
one face and the adjoining end retain cortex but the opposite face is decorticate. The decorticate
face shows several large, old flake scars and a large fresher flake scar. The cortical face exhibits
multiple small flake removals opposite the cortical end with battering evident along this flaked
edge, suggesting use as a small, core chopper (Figure 26). Three other Edwards chert cores were
also found: exhausted cores from 0â10 cmbs (FS 17/11) and 100â110 cmbs (FS 27/3); and a
tested cobble from 0â10 cmbs (FS 17/12).
Eleven pieces of edge-modified debitage were collected throughout the depth of the unit. Ten
specimens are of Edwards chert and one is of fossiliferous chert. Each shows evidence of
minimal modification along at least one edge. These primary and tertiary flakes as well as flake
fragments and shatter were modified for likely use as expedient tools for a variety of functions.
A single complete unburned quartzite cobble (FS 19/3) showing battering on one end was used as
a hammerstone and was retrieved from the 20â30-cmbs level. Six other burned fragments of
quartzite may have been possible mano fragments, although the small sizes of the fractured pieces
make this a rather ambiguous determination.
Aside from the above tools, the majority of the recovered lithic material from the unit consists of
unmodified debitage. Edwards chert varieties, as well as minimal amounts of fossiliferous chert
and translucent chert, make up more than 98 percent of the raw materials, with quartzite varieties
comprising less than 2 percent of the assemblage. Shatter was most in evidence (approximately
38 percent), followed by thin flake fragments (19 percent) and tertiary flakes (15 percent). The
remaining debitage assemblage is composed of distal flake fragments (11 percent), biface
thinning flakes (8 percent), secondary flakes (7 percent), and platform-bearing remnants (0.9
percent) and primary flakes (0.7 percent). Among the debitage assemblage, the limited number

of primary flakes (n=9) is noticeable. Approximately 38 percent of the specimens show
indications of burning (28 percent) or heat-treatment (10 percent), but the majority
(approximately 62 percent) appears not to have been subjected to thermal alteration. The
majority of the debitage (97 percent) exceeds 9.5 mm in size, and of that percentage,
approximately 41 percent falls into the 12.5â19-mm size range.
Below the plowzone, a noticeable peak occurs in debitage frequency between 60 and 70 cmbs,
and counts remain high until the onset of the B horizon at 110 cmbs (Figure 27).
FCR was retrieved throughout the depth of the unit: 329 pieces (approximately 1928 g) were
collected from subsurface contexts. No clustering suggestive of intact hearths was noted.
Instead, FCR was found scattered throughout the unit with no particular patterning.

Historic Artifact Assemblage
Approximately 96 percent of the historic materials recovered from site 41BL1352 were found in
TU 3, the majority of which are associated with the historic trash pit feature discussed above.
The unit yielded 310 historic artifacts, of which Metal fragments comprise the major part (Table
6). Building material consists primarily of Architectural brick fragments, with one piece of
Activities asphalt (10â20 cmbs), likely from road construction, and a piece of asbestos siding
(30â40 cmbs).

The 21 recovered ceramics are primarily Domestic whiteware (pure white, n=9, post-1890; light
ivory, n=1, post-1920; and light blue tinted, n=3, 1880â1930), as well as one burned/discolored
fragment) and porcelain (bluish gray glaze, n=4) fragments. However, the 28â40-cmbs level
yielded an Architectural redware terra cotta tile fragment and two Personal 4-hole porcelain
buttons. The Domestic ceramic fragments are predominantly body sherds, with only three rim
sherds found. One whiteware bowl fragment consists of a rim and footring.

Glass composed of Architectural window glass (n=17; primarily from the upper 40 cmbs),
Domestic bottle and body sherd fragments (n=59; 0â110 cmbs), Furnishings lamp glass
fragments (n=2, 30â40 and 80â90 cmbs), and a Personal 2-hole milk glass button (10â20 cmbs)
comprise the classifiable glass items. Two glass fragments (0â10 and 20â30 cmbs) were of
Indeterminate function. Domestic glass consists of amber/brown (n=10), aqua (n=3), ash tint
(n=10, post-1915), clear (n=29, variously from post-1880â1930), light green (n=2), light tint
(n=1), and manganese/solarized (n=4, 1870sâ1920) fragments. One glass fragment is a basal
sherd (post-1880), five are from the same bottle base with an Owens ring makerâs mark (1930),
and one is an automatic bottle machine lip (post-1910), but the major portion of the glass consists
of body sherds (n=52).
Metal fragments of Indeterminate iron and lead (n=121; 0â140 cmbs) make up the majority of the
historic artifacts from the unit. However, among the identifiable metal are Activities items
(n=22; 0â70 cmbs) such as machine parts, staples, .22 short cartridge cases (post-1867, n=5; and
post-1931, n=2), a piece of barbed wire (post-1874, n=1), bolts, nuts, and a possible rivet, washer,
and a possible syringe needle; Architectural items (n=40; 0â100 cmbs) of cut (1830â1880, n=1)
and wire (post-1890, n=39) nails; and Domestic items (n=4; 10â70 cmbs) of a tin can rim (postÂ­
1904), two crown bottle caps (post-1892), and copper wool. Items classified as Other are
Personal 2-hole shell buttons (n=3; 10â20, 20â30, and 28â40 cmbs) as well as a sheet of modern
plastic (30â40 cmbs, post 1945) and slag (28â40 cmbs).

Surface South of Test Unit 3
Two artifacts were collected from the general site surface approximately 10 m south of TU 3
(Table 7). A small, complete, unstemmed Edwards chert biface (FS 1/1) has a slightly concave
base; one lateral edge has a smooth curve from base to tip, but the proximal half of the opposite
lateral edge is relatively straight then angles to the distal tip. The curved edge has finer retouch
than the angled edge. This very thin biface was likely hafted for use as a knife (Figure 28). The
second artifact from the surface south of TU 3 is a large, edge-modified Edwards chert tertiary
flake with minimal modification along the ventral face of one distal lateral edge.

TEST UNIT 4
TU 4 was a 1-x-1-m test unit excavated in the southeast quadrant of the impact zone. Again,
extensive cracking was noted in the walls of the unit (Figures 29 and30) and debitage was
consistently found in random orientations within peds (Figure 31).
As with the other units, TU 4 yielded primarily lithic materials (0â90 cmbs). No FCR or vegetal
material was found in this unit, and historic material was limited to only two pieces of glass.
However, 14 fragments of mussel shell were discovered between 0 and 70 cmbs (see âFaunal
Remainsâ discussion at the end of this chapter).

Prehistoric Artifact Assemblage
TU 4 yielded the second highest amount of prehistoric lithic material. Debitage and cores
(n=136) comprised the major classification category, with only five tools among the assemblage.
Artifacts were recovered from 0â90 cmbs (Table 8). The majority of the artifacts were recovered
from the upper 30-cm plowzone, and artifacts gradually decreased with depth below the
plowzone. It is interesting to note that the artifact peak observed between 60 and 70 cmbs in TU
3 was absent in TU 4. On the other hand, another Early Archaic (Hoxie) dart point was recovered
between 60 and 70 cmbs in TU 4 (see description below), just one level above the Early Archaic
Nolan dart point recovered from TU 3.

The base/stem and proximal blade forms the extant portion of an Edwards chert projectile point
fragment (FS 47/1) found at 60â70 cmbs. An estimated one-third to one-half of the distal blade is
missing. The point exhibits a strong shoulder on one lateral edge, but the opposite shoulder and
some of the adjacent blade above the shoulder location are missing. The stem is expanding and
has a slightly concave base; minimal grinding is noted on the stem edges. Predominantly large,
gross flake scars are across both faces, with minimal edge retouch evident. An impact fracture
observable at midpoint within the blade break near the surface of one face likely contributed to
the removal of the distal half of the blade (Figure 32). The morphology of the extant point is
closely akin to the Early Archaic Hoxie dart point type.

Figure 32. Early Archaic Hoxie dart point stem and proximal blade fragment (FS 47/1), TU 4.

A distal flake fragment from 50â60 cmbs shows minimal edge modification along one short
extant original edge (FS 46/3). All other edges are broken but no modification is apparent on any
of these other edges.
The three pieces of ground/battered stone consist of two hammerstones and a possible
hammerstone/polishing stone. The possible hammerstone/polishing stone (0â10 cmbs) is a
complete, cortical, medium-sized, round, relatively flat pebble of unidentifiable material with
indication of a possible smoothed-over battered area on one end. Of the other two hammerstones
(20â30 cmbs), one consist of a large oval-shaped, relatively flat, pebble (probably quartzite) with
indication of battering on one end, and the other is a small quartzite pebble with indication of
battering at the break on one end.
The two cores are both of Edwards chert, one a multidirectional indeterminate fragment (20â30
cmbs) and the other an exhausted core (40â50 cmbs).
The 134 pieces of debitage are all of Edwards chert and made up primarily of shatter (27 percent),
followed by tertiary flakes (22 percent) and thin flake fragments (16 percent). Comprising lesser
amounts of debitage types are distal flake fragments (11 percent), secondary flakes (9 percent),
biface thinning and platform-bearing flakes (4 percent each), and primary flakes (1 percent). The
majority of the assemblage falls into the 12.5â19-mm size range (34 percent) and the 9.5â12.5Â­
mm range (23 percent). Most of the debitage (60 percent) shows no indication of thermal
alteration, but 28 percent is burned/potlidded and 12 percent appears to have been heat-treated.

Historic Artifact Assemblage
The historic material from TU 4 was limited to two pieces of glass: one piece of Architectural
light green window glass and an Indeterminate clear glass (post-1880) angular fragment (Table
9).

FAUNAL REMAINS
Because of evidence for postdepositional mixing and the presence of both historic and prehistoric
components, it was not possible in all cases to confidently separate faunal remains into their
respective cultural components. Except for the presence of two saw-cut deer size specimens that
are clearly historic, the temporal assignment of faunal remains is treated here conservatively.
Table 10 shows the distribution of animal bone and mussel shell for each test unit. A total of 201
faunal remains (189 mussel shell fragments and 12 bone fragments) was recovered from testing at
41BL1352, with approximately 92 percent (n=184) of the total recovered from TU 3. No animal
bone or mussel shell was recovered from TU 2 and only sparse fragments of mussel shell were
recovered from TUs 1 and 4. No patterning with depth was observed within TUs 1 and 4.
All of the animal bone (n=12) was recovered from TU 3, the majority of which came either from
the upper 20 cmbs within the plowzone (n=5) or from the historic trash pit feature (n=4). The
majority of these bones are small mammal or deer size shaft fragments unidentifiable to elements,
but one saw-cut deer size rib fragment was found within the historic trash pit. The remaining
three bone fragments (two deer size shaft fragments and one small mammal shaft fragment) were
recovered below the plowzone and outside of the feature fill; however, given the evidence of
artifact translocation associated with shrink-swell, in addition to the abundance of earthworm
castings within the feature fill, it is possible, if not likely, that all of the animal bone recovered
from 41BL1352 is associated with the historic component.
Consistent with the patterning of most of the other artifact types recovered from the site, the
mussel shell fragment density within TU 3 is highest in the upper 30 cmbs within the plowzone,
representing approximately 34 percent (n=59) of the total mussel shell recovered from the unit.
Between 30 and 50 cmbs, mussel shell counts seem to fluctuate with no discernable pattern, but a
clear increase occurs between 50 and 90 cmbs and also between 100 and 110 cmbs (Figure 33).
When compared to debitage distributions within TU 3, it is interesting to note that mussel shell
and debitage counts each peak at approximately 60â70 cmbs. This adds additional support to the
interpretation that a lower component is represented at the site.

CHAPTER 7
SITE 41BL1352 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

DISCUSSION

Prehistoric Component and Artifact Assemblage
Site 41BL1352 yielded a total of 1803 prehistoric artifacts. All material falls into the lithics
categoryâchipped stone, ground stone, or FCR. Among the tool assemblage are 12 projectile
points (six dart, four arrow, and two indeterminate point fragments) representing cultural
timeframes from the Early Archaic to the Late Prehistoric; 26 stone tools (10 chipped stone
bifaces/fragments and one uniface, 14 edge-modified debitage pieces, and a core tool), as well as
10 possible ground/battered stone tool fragments. Five cores, 1412 pieces of unmodified
debitage, and 338 pieces (1977 g) of FCR were all collected from subsurface contexts. All but
two of the lithic artifacts came from the four test units. These two are from the general site
surface, collected south of TU 3.
Excluding FCR, the overwhelming raw material observed within the 1455 chipped lithics
assemblage is chert: Edwards chert varieties (n=1398; 96 percent), with markedly less amounts
of fossiliferous chert (n=16; 1 percent), translucent chert (n=6; 0.4 percent), and burned
undifferentiated chert (n=2; 0.1 percent). Limited quantities of quartzite (n=30; 2 percent) and
jasper (n=3; 0.2 percent) were also noted among the chipped stone. Of the 10 possible ground
stone pieces, eight (80 percent) are of quartzite and two (20 percent) cortical pieces are of an
unidentifiable material.
The majority of the combined 1466 chipped stone and ground stone assemblages show no
indication of having been subjected to thermal alteration (n=910; 62 percent, which includes 3
ground stone), but 164 (11 percent, which includes 2 ground stone) pieces appear to have been
heat-treated to facilitate chipping qualities. Burned, potlidded, crazed fractures or surfaces were
noted on 391 (27 percent, which includes 5 of the ground stone) specimens. Heating/burning on
one piece of cortical ground stone was indeterminate.

59

Debitage sizes range from less than 6.3 mm to greater than 51 mm. Among the 1412 flakes and
pieces of shatter, 576 (approximately 41 percent) fall into the 12.5â19-mm size range and 308
(roughly 22 percent) are between 19 and 25 mm in size, together accounting for approximately 63
percent of the assemblage. The remaining debitage falls into size ranges either larger or smaller
than these ranges in decreasing amounts: 9.5â12.5 and 25â51 mm (n=242 and n=240,
respectively, each approximately 17 percent), 6.3â9.5 mm (n=42, roughly 3 percent), and 51â76
mm and less than 6.3 mm (n=2 each, less than 1 percent).
The definitive presence of artifacts at all excavated depths, particularly within TU 3, indicates
that either (1) continuous occupations occurred on a slowly aggrading surface or (2) artifacts were
deposited on a stable surface or surfaces and were later incorporated at greater depths due to
shrink-swell processes. Due to the difficulty in visually identifying occupation horizons within
the dark, Blackland clay in addition to the evidence for shrink-swell processes, it is not possible at
the current scale of analysis to distinguish between these two potential scenarios. On the other
hand, the distinct peak in both debitage and mussel shell found at approximately 60â70 cmbs in
TU 3 may suggest that a lower occupation component is present at the site. The recovery of an
Early Archaic Nolan dart point between 70 and 80 cmbs in TU 3 and an Early Archaic Hoxie dart
point between 60 and 70 cmbs in TU 4 seems to indicate that the lower occupation component is
of Early Archaic age; however, the recovery of a Transitional Archaic Darl dart point between 90
and 100 cmbs, below the Early Archaic points, confounds this interpretation. From this evidence
of inverted stratigraphy, it is clear that significant postdepositional mixing has occurred and that
occupation horizons have been obscured.
Such evidence of inverted stratigraphy is not uncommon in sites dominated by clay-rich
sediments. For example, Hofman (1986), conducting analysis on a site with vertic characteristics
along the Duck River in Tennessee, found that artifacts spanning 7000 years of prehistory had
moved vertically 20â40 cm. In other instances, archeologists have noted that once-horizontal
paleosols have been turned to near vertical through time by shrink-swell processes.
Due to the postdepositional artifact movement, it is also ambiguous as to if or how lithic
reduction strategies may have changed through time at 41BL1352. When the site is considered as
a whole, the presence of the full range of lithic classes from core reduction to biface thinning and
a diverse tool assemblage suggests that all reduction stages were performed at the site. On the
other hand, it is unclear if such was the case for each occupation or if specific stages were
performed at particular intervals but were later blurred by shrink-swell dynamics. In addition,
although it is clear from the artifact assemblage that the site was used as a campsite in the past, it
is unclear whether the high density and wide range of artifacts indicate that the site represents
numerous small-scale occupations or several intensive occupations. Unfortunately, the absence
of intact features and clearly defined living surfaces precludes this distinction.

Historic Component and Artifact Assemblage
The comparatively limited historic assemblage from site 41BL1352 totals 321 artifacts. Among
the total assemblage, artifacts fall into the major functional categories of Activities (n=28),
Architectural (n=75), Domestic (n=84), Furnishings subcategory (n=2), and Personal (n=6), as
well as within the Indeterminate category (n=126) for those items to which a function cannot be
assigned, based on Southâs (1977) classification system.

60

Among the historic artifact assemblage collected from site 41BL1352, the 28 Activities-related
artifacts include seven .22 Short cartridge cases, a piece of barbed wire, a box staple, a piece of
braided copper wire and an associated crimp connector, a castle nut, three fence staples, a lump of
asphalt, five pieces of slag, two iron machine parts, a poultry staple, a rivet, a square-headed bolt,
part of a hypodermic needle, and a washer. The piece of barbed wire is a single strand with a
two-prong barb, consistent with either a Gliddenâs Barb, One-Stranded Variation, or a Putnamâs
Fence Wire (Cliffton 1970:31â32). Two of the .22 Short cartridge cases have a diamond
headstamp indicating that they were produced by the Winchester Western Company (post-1931),
and the remaining five cartridges have a âUâ headstamp indicating that they were made by the
Union Metallic Cartridge Company (post-1867 [Remington 2011; Steinhauer 2011]). The box
staple is a flat piece of iron recurved on one end that is similar in form to the copper staples used
today to join corrugated cardboard boxes. Two possible machine parts were also collected.
Finally, the hypodermic needle fragment consists of a nickel- or chrome-plated brass ferrule
about 6 mm in diameter and 14 mm in length that represents the portion connecting the needle to
the syringe. One end of the artifact is open, but the other end narrows to a point. A small spot of
rust at the end of the point is thought to be the remains of the needle. The artifact is marked âB-D
YALEâ; an Internet search shows that B-D Yale is a current manufacturer of hypodermic needles.
The 75 Architectural items include 10 pieces of machine-made brick (post-1903), three pieces of
hand-made brick (pre-1903), a redware tile fragment, 18 pieces of window glass, one cut (1830â
1880) and 41 wire (post-1890) nails (Nelson 1968), and a piece of asbestos siding. The
proportion of wire nails to cut nails suggests that the initial construction may have been in the
1890s, when cut nails were rapidly being replaced by wire nails. This contention may also be
supported by the presence of both hand- and machine-made brick in the assemblage.
Alternatively, these data could indicate a reuse of salvaged materials.
Comprising the 84 Domestic items are 19 pieces of historic ceramics, 61 pieces of glass, and four
metal artifacts. The 19 pieces of ceramic include pieces of porcelain (n=5); as well as
whitewareâwhite whiteware (n=9; post-1890), light blue tinted whiteware (n=3; 1880â1930,
light ivory tinted whiteware (n=1; post-1920) (Moir 1987:102)âand one burned/discolored
whiteware fragment. The 61 glass artifacts include amber/brown body sherds (n=10), aqua body
sherds (n=3), clear with ash tint body sherds (n=10; post-1915), clear body (n=23; post-1880
[Kendrick 1971]) and basal (n=1; post-1880) sherds, light green body sherds (n=3), light tinted
body sherd (n=1), and manganese/solarized body sherds (n=4; 1870sâ1920 [Lockhart 2006:52]).
More-distinctive glass artifacts include a clear glass bottle neck with a straight brandy finish that
was produced on an automatic bottle machine (post-1910 [Society for Historical Archeology
(SHA) 2011a, 2011b]) and a bottle base with an off-center Owens ring. The bottle base consists
of five fragments (originally nine fragments, of which five refit) that were recovered as a broken
but single artifact. The base is embossed with â1 [I in diamond over oval] 0/3â and the â3â is at a
right angle to the remaining marks. The â1â is the plant where the bottle was produced (in this
case Toledo), the âI in diamond over ovalâ mark was used by Owens-Illinois between 1929 and
1954, the â0â is the last digit of the date of manufacture, and the â3â indicates the mold used
(Toulouse 1971:403). Although the â0â date stamp could represent one of several years of
production, Toulouse (1971:395) shows that the Toledo plant closed in the late 1930s, indicating
that this bottle was most likely made in 1930. The remaining Domestic artifacts recovered
include a sanitary can rim (post-1904 [Busch 1981:97â98]), two crown caps (post-1892 [SHA
2011c]), and a mass of copper wool.

61

The Furnishings category includes two pieces of clear lamp glass (post-1880). The Personal
category is composed solely of buttons: one milk glass 2-hole, two porcelain 4-hole, and three
shell 2-hole buttons.
The 126 Indeterminate artifacts are largely composed of wire fragments (n=55) and unidentifiable
thin metal fragments (n=60). Other metal artifacts consist of a rectangular iron bar 135-x-45-x-3
mm in size, two pieces of sheet lead about 2 mm thick, a tapered iron rod, a bent spike consistent
in form with the steps used on utility poles, and a teardrop-shaped piece of iron consistent with a
finial from eating utensils. The remaining Indeterminate artifacts are a small sheet of pink plastic
(post-1945), as well as an amber/brown angular glass fragment, a burned/melted piece of clear
glass, and two clear glass angular fragments.
The presence of a cut nail (1830â1880) in the collection indicates an occupation beginning in the
late nineteenth century, which is supported by the presence of manganese/solarized glass (1870sâ
1920) and light blue tinted whiteware (1880â1930). The cut nail was found in the 80â90 cmbs
level below numerous wire nails (post-1890) in upper levels, which seems to suggest
bioturbation. Other materials such as the bottle base (1930), Winchester Western cartridge cases
(post-1931), and plastic (post-1945) indicate that occupation continued into the mid-twentieth
century. The other datable materials occupy a broad late nineteenth-century to twentieth-century
timeframe and are of little use in refining the site chronology.
Based on the presence of the historic component, historic maps of the area were consulted to
provide information of past structures that may have been either onsite or in the vicinity of site
41BL1352. A review of historic aerial images from the Army Map Service (via Earth Explorer)
flown in 1953 and from the United States Geological Service (USGS) flown in 1962, USGS
topographic maps (1963 Yarrelton 7.5' and 1964 Rogers 7.5' quadrangles), and a 1918 Bell
County soils map (United States Bureau of Soils 1918) did not identify any mapped structures at
the location of 41BL1325. According to the 1918 soils map, the two nearest structures mapped at
that time are approximately 300 m and 400 m to the south and southwest of site 41BL1352,
respectively (Figure 34). The soils map also shows a historic road skirting across the terrace near
site 41BL1352 before descending across Big Elm Creek west of the site. The road appears to
have been approximately 50 m from the site in 1918. According to the landowner, who has
occupied this landscape for approximately 70 years, no structures have been present at the
location of site 41BL1352 during this time. As no diagnostics were found that could tie the
feature to a particular person, place, or event, the origin of the trash pit remains unclear.

SITE 41BL1352 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Though site 41BL1352 yielded a high density and wide variety of artifacts and diagnostic
materials, a Transitional Archaic Darl dart point was found clearly below two Early Archaic dart
points. This evidence of inverted stratigraphy in combination with additional evidence of
significant shrink-swell processes such as extensive cracking and random orientation of artifacts
within the clay matrix indicates that the deposits at the site retain little integrity. In addition, the
lack of intact subsurface prehistoric cultural features within and below the plowzone limits the
research potential of site 41BL1352. Although an intact historic trash pit feature was
encountered, archival investigations and a conversation with the landowner failed to reveal data
pertinent to NRHP Criteria aâd (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a-d]) or to SAL designation criteria (Title 9,
Chapter 191) in reference to the historic component.
62

Therefore, the portion of the site within the project corridor is considered to have little research
potential due to poor contextual integrity and the lack of intact in situ diagnostic artifacts or
features. Nonetheless, site 41BL1352 has not been fully assessed since it extends beyond the
current project right-of-way, so it is recommended as of unknown NRHP eligibility or SAL
designation. However, the portion of the site within the right-of-way would not contribute to the
siteâs NRHP eligibility if it were later determined eligible, and therefore, no further work is
required at site 41BL1352 within the right-of-way.

CHAPTER 8
MONITORING LOCATIONS

The 27 monitored tower locations (Table 11) were identified by Power Engineers, Inc. (Karbula
and Black 2011), during the initial Phase I survey of the Bell County East transmission line. The
tower locations were clustered in three separate locations (Figure 2). Four towers were located
between Walkers Creek and Little Pond Creek and five towers were north of Pond Creek on the
western (right bank) of the Brazos River, and 18 towers were on the eastern (left bank) of the
Brazos River. The recommendations for monitoring of drilling at the tower locations were based
on the presence of Holocene sediments below depths excavated during shovel testing (i.e., below
80 centimeters below surface [cmbs] or 32 inches below surface [inbs]). During the
geoarcheological investigation portion of the Phase I survey (Frederick 2011), the Brazos River
valley was found to have a high probability of containing Holocene sediments up to 16 m below
surface (mbs; 53 ft below surface [ftbs]), and buried living surfaces (paleosols) were likely to be
present to this depth. Cultural resources monitoring at archeological sites 41MM377, 41MM378,
and 41MM379 to be affected by brush clearing was recommended to ensure that disturbances to
cultural deposits at the sites were minimal (Figure 3). The monitoring conducted during drilling
of the tower supports within the previously tested portion of site 41BL1352 was to ensure no
cultural deposits were affected by tower installation.

METHODS

The methods employed by Geo-Marine during geoarcheological monitoring of tower support
drilling followed PBS&J (2008), which outlines the generic research design for archeological
surveys of Oncor transmission lines in Texas. In short, geoarcheological monitoring was
conducted during all ground-disturbing activities that had the potential to encounter archeological
materials. Deep trenching, the method typically used to test for archeological materials below 80
cmbs (32 inbs), could not be conducted near the proposed tower locations because trenching
would destabilize the ground and undisturbed soil is required to support the tower structure
foundations. As a result, the only suitable method for determining if deeply buried archeological
deposits were present at the tower locations is to monitor the soil as it is being removed by an
auger from the foundation excavation. Specifically, monitoring involves visual examination of
soil as it is being removed from the auger with the goal of identifying high-probability strata as
well as screening a small sample of the soil matrix from the auger as frequently as possible.
During the current project, it was not possible to screen a sample each time the auger was
removed as outlined in PBS&J (2008) because this procedure would have slowed the drilling
process significantly. Descriptions of the examined soil followed the guidelines and terminology
established by the National Soil Survey Center (Schoeneberger et al. 2002), and soil colors were
recorded using a Munsell Soil Color Chart. To prevent interruption of the drilling process, depths
of soil horizons were estimated, based on observation of the auger shaft depth rather than
precisely with a tape measure each time the auger was removed.
If cultural material is encountered in an auger hole, a larger sample of the soil yielding the
artifact(s) will be screened. If significant archeological materials are present, operations will be
halted and the onsite Project Archeologist will contact the Principal Investigator to describe the
findings. A professional opinion will then be made concerning the potential significance of the
remains and the likelihood of further damage to the resource if augering is continued. If it is
determined, after consultation with the THC Archeology Division, that the archeological deposits
are significant but will not suffer any additional adverse impacts, augering will be allowed to
continue. On the other hand, if it is determined that the deposits will be damaged further by
continuing to auger, then the Oncor Electric Project Manager will be notified and the structure
will be moved. If the structure cannot be moved due to engineering designs, then augering will
be allowed to continue, but at a slower pace and larger samples of fill will be thoroughly
screened.
73

If significant archeological materials are encountered, a minimum of six smaller auger holes
(approximately 1 ft [30 cm] in diameter) will be excavated along transects radiating out from
each of the structure footings. The additional auger holes will be placed approximately 30 to 40
ft (9â14 m) away from each structure footing. Following the testing, a sketch map will be drawn
showing all of the activities performed in the area and a permanent trinomial designation will be
obtained.
In addition to monitoring of tower support drilling, monitoring was also required during ROW
vegetation clearing at three previously recorded archeological sites (41MM377, 41MM378, and
41MM379). Each of the sites was visited prior to brush clearing and the site boundaries were
marked with wooden stakes and flagging tape. Crews were then instructed that all clearing
methods within the flagged boundaries were to be conducted under the supervision of a cultural
resources monitor.
Typically, ROW clearing is conducted by a bulldozer equipped with grubber blades to uproot and
move trees and brush. Although the majority of the sediment movement during grubbing is
minimized by the design of the grubber blades to filter the sediment once the root system is
removed, disturbance to the surface and subsurface is unavoidable. As a result, efforts were made
to use a FECON machine to clear brush from culturally sensitive areas. The FECON causes less
impact to the subsurface because vegetation is not uprooted. Instead, churning blades cut
vegetation just above the surface, leaving the root structures intact. The only impact to the
subsurface during this process results from penetration of small spikes located on the metal tracks
of the FECON; however, the depth of impacts is limited to just several inches below the ground
surface.
The FECON was used to clear brush at 41MM377 and 41MM378 since it was determined that
there was no significant archeological materials on or just below the ground surface. Site
41MM379, on the other hand, required hand cutting of vegetation due to the potential for intact
archeological materials on or just below the ground surface. The potential for ground disturbance
within the ROW at 41MM379 was limited to brush clearing and foot traffic since a tower location
is not proposed within the site boundary. No vehicular traffic was anticipated within the site
boundary since the site is along the bank edge of Little Pond Creek, which is too entrenched to
warrant a bridge or culvert. The initial survey did not encounter any diagnostic materials or intact
features at the site during pedestrian walkover and shovel testing; however, it was noted as a
possibility that dense vegetation may have prevented the identification of significant
archeological deposits on or just below the ground surface. Due to the potential for intact cultural
materials on the ground surface, strictly hand clearing without use of the FECON was
recommended.

74

CHAPTER 10
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project area is located within the Blackland Prairie Physiographic Region, characterized by
gently rolling prairies underlain by marls, calcareous clays, and chalk (Griffith et al. 2004). The
base geology underlying the four tower locations between Walkers Creek and Little Pond Creek
is the Navarro Group and Marlbrook Marl, undivided. The base geology underlying the five
towers north of Big Briary Creek consists of the Navarro Group and Marlbrook Marl, undivided,
the Midway Group, undivided, and Holocene alluvium. Lastly, the geology underlying the tower
locations within the Brazos River valley is primarily Holocene alluvium, though small portions of
Pleistocene and Holocene terrace deposits are present at the northeastern extent of the monitoring
project area. In total, the monitoring project area crosses 20 soil map units (Natural Resources
Conservation Service [NRCS] 2012) (Figures 37 and 38; Table 12).

WALKERS CREEK AND LITTLE POND CREEK
Soils adjacent to the four towers between Walkers Creek and Little Pond Creek are mapped as the
Burleson series and the Houston series. Both series consist of very deep, moderately well-drained
soils that formed in alkaline clayey sediments. According to the geoarcheological investigation
conducted as part of the Phase I survey for the Bell County East transmission line (Frederick
2011), Holocene sediments extend to at least 2 mbs (7 ftbs) in proximity to Walkers Creek and to
2â4 mbs (7â13 ftbs) in the Little Pond Creek stream valley.

BIG BRIARY CREEK
During the Phase I survey, the area adjacent to Big Briary Creek and an unnamed tributary to the
creek was subjected to intensive surface survey without shovel testing due to good ground surface
visibility within the cultivated fields encountered in this area. However, shovel testing was
conducted on both banks of Big Briary Creek and the tributary, but due to extremely dry, compact
clay, shovel tests were terminated at 60 cmbs (24 inbs) or above. As a result, the presence of
deep Holocene sediments was not disproved, and the potential for intact archeological sites
beyond the reach of shovel testing was considered high. A review of the Wilson and Gowen
series soils mapped in this area (see Figure 37) indicates that deep, potentially Holocene-age soils
may be present within the floodplain and along the stream terraces flanking the floodplain.

BRAZOS RIVER HOLOCENE VALLEY
The geoarcheological investigation determined that approximately 18,000 linear feet (or 3.4 miles
[mi; 5.5 kilometers {km}]) of the Brazos River Holocene Valley is traversed by the transmission
corridor. The results of the investigation also indicated that between 12 and 16 m (39 and 53 ft)
of Holocene deposits may underlie the current ground surface where the 18 monitored tower
78

locations traverse the left bank of the river. Buried A-horizons have been mapped in soils similar
to the types within the Brazos River Holocene Valley, particularly within the Weswood series, the
Ships series, and the Highbank series, which have been shown to contain sequences of buried
soils below 180 cmbs (71 inbs). This indicates potentially long periods of stabile surfaces were
present adjacent to ancient meanders of the Brazos River. Rapid deposition associated with highenergy flooding typical of the Brazos River in the past likely produced high probability settings
for deeply buried, potentially intact archeological sites within the locations to be penetrated by
deep augering.

RESULTS

CULTURAL RESOURCES MONITORING OF TOWER SUPPORT DRILLING

Walkers Creek and Little Pond Creek
Monitoring of the tower support structures was initiated at the four tower locations (19/4, 19/5.
20/1, 20/2) between Walkers Creek and Little Pond Creek (Figure 39; see Figure 35). The
augering encountered variable depths to sterile subsoil below the ground surface ranging from
approximately 50 cmbs (20 inbs) in tower 20/1 to 140 cmbs (55 inbs) in tower 19/4 (Table 13).
Holocene sediments observed above these depths consisted of very dark gray clay with many
stream-polished limestone pebbles that was underlain by sterile subsoil consisting of light olive
brown clay with yellowish brown to light brownish gray mottles and many stream-polished
limestone pebbles (Figure 40). No cultural materials or buried surfaces were found during
drilling of these four tower structures.

Big Briary Creek
Monitoring of tower support drilling was resumed adjacent to Big Briary Creek (Figure 41). The
soils encountered during augering at the five locations (25/2, 26/1, 26/2, 26/3, 26/4) adjacent to
Big Briary Creek and its unnamed tributary were very similar to soils encountered between
Walkers Creek and Little Pond Creek discussed above. Holocene soils were observed to extend
beyond 80 cmbs (32 inbs) in three of the five tower locations (see Table 3) and were all underlain
by subsoil consisting of grayish brown to light olive brown and olive brown clay with light
brownish gray mottling and calcium carbonate masses. Augering extended to beyond 400 cmbs
(158 inbs) and no buried A-horizons were encountered below the onset of subsoil. Interestingly
though, a single chert flake was recovered from the southeast tower support hole at a depth of
approximately 200 cmbs (79 inbs). The matrix containing the flake consisted of a clay loam with
very dark gray and brown mottles and may represent a transitional zone between the uppermost
A-horizon and the underlying sterile subsoil. However, it is also possible that the flake originated
from sediments closer to the surface within the upper A-horizon and was moved to lower depths
due to auger disturbance. Careful screening of a larger sample of the soil above and below the

Brazos River Holocene Valley
flake did not reveal additional evidence of an archeological site being present and the flake was
thus considered an isolated find. Due to the isolated nature of the find and questionable origin, it
was determined to be unnecessary at the time to halt the drilling process or to excavate additional
auger probes. No additional cultural materials were recovered during tower support drilling at
these five locations.
The soils encountered during augering at the 18 locations (31/2-31/4, 32/1-31/5, 33/1-33/4, 34/1Â­
34-4, 35/1) for tower construction within the Brazos River Holocene Valley were highly variable
due to the dynamic nature of this high-energy depositional environment (see Table 3). Augering
was initiated closest to the current path of the Brazos River (Figure 42) and progressed to the
northeast. The soils encountered at the first tower (31/2) location were consistent with levee
deposits since sediments consisted of loose fine sandy loam with distinct 2â3-millimeter (mm;
0.8â0.12 in) bedding plane lenses and rounded limestone pebbles and hematite nodules to over
600 cmbs (236 inbs). Progressing to the northeast, the soils encountered in the next two tower
locations (31/3, 31/4) were consistent with Holocene clay floodplain deposits and augering was
terminated at approximately 500 cmbs (197 inbs) in reddish brown friable silty clay with calcium
carbonate threads.

For the five towers numbered 32/1 through 32/5, the textures of the soils encountered from the
ground surface to the base of the auger holes were highly variable alternating between silty clay,
clay, and silty loam. It was clear that the alternating textures were controlled primarily by flood
deposition of varying energies, although varying degrees of soil development was also observed
within these depths. Due to the evidence of deep flood deposition, buried-A-horizons were
anticipated within and below depths of auger termination. In fact, a dark brown (10YR 3/3)
buried-A-horizon consisting of silty clay with crushed snail shells was found from approximately
458â610 (180â240 inbs) cmbs in tower 32/3. The approximate 150-cm (59-in) thickness of the
buried-A-horizon suggests that a stabile surface persisted for a long period of time prior to being
buried by the thick flood deposits overlying it. Although this is considered a high probability
horizon for the presence of intact archeological sites, none was found. This distinct buried Ahorizon was not located again during augering but may still present in some areas to the northeast
up to the onset of the Pleistocene and Holocene terraces at the northeastern extent of the
monitored project area. Textures at augering termination depths to the northeast of 32/3 were
variable with some foundations ending in fine sandy deposits and others ending in compact silty
clay with calcium carbonate. Due to a reroute shortening the length of the ROW northeast of the
Brazos River, tower number 33/5, which was among the original numbering system for towers
that required monitoring during augering, was eliminated from the design plans. Augering of the
last two tower supports (34/5 and 35/1) encountered terrace deposits consisting of large limestone
pebbles and parent material consisting of weathered shale. No cultural materials were recovered
in any of the 18 tower locations within the Brazos Holocene River Valley.

CULTURAL RESOURCES MONITORING OF ROW BRUSH CLEARING

Site 41MM377
Brush clearing at site 41MM377 was conducted strictly with the use of the FECON and no
grubbing was conducted (Figure 43; see Figure 36). No cultural materials were observed during
or subsequent to clearing and the process did not appear to significantly affect the integrity of the
deposits at 41MM377.

Site 41MM378
Brush clearing at site 41MM378 was also conducted strictly with the use of the FECON and no
grubbing was involved. No cultural materials were observed during (Figure 44a) or subsequent
to (Figure 44b) clearing and the process did not appear to significantly affect the integrity of the
deposits at 41MM378.

Site 41MM379
The final monitoring during ROW brush clearing was conducted at site 41MM379. Geo-Marine
personnel first identified the site boundary using flagging tape (Figure 45a), and then crews were
instructed to hand-cut all vegetation within and immediately adjacent to the marked site
boundary. In addition, all vegetation was carried and not dragged along the ground surface
(Figure 45b). The brush was then placed in a pile safely outside of the site boundary. Because
vegetation within the site was sparse, the clearing process observed by Geo-Marine imparted
minimal impacts to the integrity of 41MM379.
Site 41BL1352
Prior to monitoring at site 41BL1352, eligibility testing was undertaken because a transmission
tower was to be installed within the boundary of the site. Section II above provides an in-depth
discussion of site testing at 41BL1352. Subsequent to eligibility testing at the site, cultural
resources monitoring was conducted during drilling for the installation of the Oncor transmission
tower within the site boundary. A monitor was present during drilling for each of the four tower
support piers, which ranged in depth between 5 and 6 mbs (15 and 20 ftbs), to ensure that no
deeply buried intact features or buried surfaces were present below previously excavated depths.
The sediments expelled during each of the drill increments and the sidewalls of the drill holes
were carefully examined during the drilling process; however, no intact features, diagnostic
materials, or buried surfaces were encountered during monitoring (Figure 46). In short, the
results of the monitoring did not change the recommendations of unknown eligibility for site
41BL1352.

CHAPTER 12
MONITORING CONCLUSIONS

Geo-Marine, Inc., personnel was present during augering of all 27 of the tower locations
requiring monitoring, and this cultural resources monitoring of tower support drilling did not
encounter any significant archeological materials to slow or alter Oncorâs drilling process. The
drilling process only encountered one isolated chert flake at 200 cmbs (79 inbs) adjacent to Big
Briary Creek. No other archeological materials were found. Although three of the five tower
locations adjacent to Briary did not encounter Holocene deposits below 80 cmbs (31 inbs) or
paleosols below the onset of sterile subsoil, the presence of a flake at approximately 200 cmbs
(79 inbs) may indicate the potential for deeply buried archaeological materials adjacent to Big
Briary Creek. As a result, future impacts below 80 cmbs (31 inbs) in this area should require the
presence of a cultural resources monitor or trenching.
Monitoring of augering between Walkers Creek and Little Pond Creek encountered relatively
shallow depths of Holocene sediments ranging from 50 cmbs (20 inbs) to 140 cmbs (55 inbs) and
no buried soils were observed below these depths. As a result, future cultural resources surveys
in this area should consist of shovel testing without major concerns for deeply buried
archaeological materials.
Monitoring of augering within the Brazos River Holocene Valley indicated a high-energy
depositional environment extends a great distance beyond the current channel of the Brazos
River. Although paleosols lacking archeological materials were observed within depths
penetrated by augering, the auger holes represent only a very small sample of the alluvial valley,
and the results do not disprove the presence of deeply buried archeological sites within the valley
nor the need for monitoring or deep testing in this area of the valley if the necessity arises.
However, it is clear that the 18 tower supports excavated within the valley did not encounter
significant archeological materials.
Cultural resources monitoring of brush clearing did not encounter any new information regarding
sites 41MM377, 41MM378, and 41MM379. The brush clearing by hand and by the FECON did
not appear to significantly disturb the deposits at the three sites.

93

Monitoring at 41BL1352 during the drilling process subsequent to testing identified no intact
features, diagnostic materials, or buried surfaces. The results of the subsequent monitoring did
not change the recommendations of unknown eligibility for site 41BL1352.

Rectangular piece of metal
135-x-45-x-3 mm in size

Discarded after analysis;
Appears to be an actuating
handle from a piece of farm
machinery; artifact is 142
mm long, up to 18.5 mm
wide, and 7.5 mm thick; there
is a round portion at one end
that is 17 mm in diameter
with a 6 mm wide hole in the
center; this is attached to a
smaller linear section 47-x-10Â­
x-7.5 mm in size, which
gradually expands into the
full width; a small knob 7
mm in diameter and 4 mm
tall protrudes from the
beginning of the full width
section that probably served
as a pivot for whatever the
handle controlled; the full
width section has a bump-out
that was probably used to
lock the handle on a metal
bar; the end is rounded and
curves upward
