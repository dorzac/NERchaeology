ABSTRACT
The City of Farmers Branch intends to expand the existing
Camelot Landfill in Denton County, Texas. The landfill expansion
areas encompass approximately 118.85 acres within a 469.62 acre
permit area on the east side of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River
south of Lewisville Lake. The existing and active landfill occupies
the 350.77 remaining permit acres. AR Consultants, Inc.
conducted an intensive pedestrian survey and shovel testing of
the proposed expansion area on December 17, 2010 and January
4, 2011. Trenching in the flood plain was performed on January
26, 2011. Investigations found no evidence of prehistoric
occupation in the floodplain or on the upland edge. A structure
plotted in the project area was not found and was determined to
have been completely destroyed. Consequently, ARC
recommends that further cultural resource investigations are
unwarranted and that the Texas Historical Commission concur. If
buried cultural deposits are discovered during the landfill
expansion, work in the area should cease immediately and the
Texas Historical Commission should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Farmers Branch intends to expand the existing Camelot Landfill in Denton
County, Texas. The landfill expansion areas encompass approximately 118.85 acres
within a 469.62 acre permit area on the east side of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River
south of Lewisville Lake. The 469.62 acres includes the existing permit boundary and the
proposed permit boundary (Figure 1). The landfill expansion will be excavated below
grade and a liner will be installed, and then fill will proceed.
Weaver Boos Consultants, which is developing a major permit amendment application
for submittal to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to authorize
future expansion of the Camelot Landfill, contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to
conduct the cultural resource investigations of the landfill. The purpose of the archival
research and archaeological survey was to determine if cultural resources had been
recorded or were present within the 469.62 acre permit boundary area, and, if present,
make recommendations about their significance and how they might be impacted by
construction.
Because the City of Farmers Branch is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, a
Texas Antiquities Permit was required for this project and permit number 5830 was
issued for this project. Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 also
applies to the environmental permitting. Other relevant federal legislation includes the
Clean Water Act, as amended (PL92500), the National Environmental Act of 1969 (PL90-190), and the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL93-291).
This report was written in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division, and developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists
(n.d.). The following report contains a brief description of the natural environment, the
cultural history of North Central Texas, and a summary of previous archaeological
investigations in the area as known from published sources. This is followed by the
research design and methodology. The description of the results of the field investigation
constitutes the majority of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations that
arise from the study. A list of references cited and an appendix containing shovel test
information concludes the report.

NATURAL SETTING
The landfill lies in the Blackland Prairies near the Eastern Cross Timbers ecotone
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). The Blackland Prairie is associated with an
outcropping of Upper Cretaceous marine chalks, marls, and shales from which the black
soil is derived. Level to gently rolling topography populated by tall grasses like little and
big bluestem would have largely defined the prairie in its native state. Wooded
bottomlands and isolated woodland clumps provide contrast to the dominant grassland.
Denton County is drained by the Elm Fork of the Trinity River and several major creeks.
Average rainfall is approximately 33 inches while the average temperature ranges from
34 degrees in January to 96 degrees in July (Odom 2010).
The landfill is underlain primarily by Quaternary-aged alluvium composed of silt, sand,
clay and gravel in the floodplain of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1991). The soil atop the northern fluviate terrace formations is the
Frio-Ovan association, of well to moderately well-drained, level, slowly permeable,
bottomland floodplain soils (Ford and Pauls 1980: General Soils Map). Specific soils
include occasionally flooded Ovan and Trinity clays, Bastrop fine sandy loam, and
Crockett fine sandy loam (Ford and Pauls 1980: Sheet 47). The Frio and Trinity clays
constitute the floodplain of the Elm Fork and across which Midway Branch flows
through the eastern edge of the landfill. The Bastrop fine sandy loam constitutes the
terrace deposits above the floodplain, while the Crockett fine sandy loam marks the
smooth upland slopes encountered in the northern extreme of the landfill.
A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North-Central Texas over the
past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring (1990),
Humphrey and Ferring (1994) and Brown (1998) offer disparate interpretations based on
different analytical approaches. The following discussion relies heavily on Ferring's
investigations and focuses upon the past two thousand years. Correlating periods of rapid
alluviation with higher precipitation and slow alluviation with drier conditions, Ferring
has concluded that the Late Holocene [5000 yr B.P. to the present] was a wet period with
moderate alluviation, except for a dry period between 2000 to 1000 yr B.P. [A.D. 11000]. It was during this dry period that the West Fork Paleosol was established on the
stable surfaces of the river meanders along the Upper Trinity and its tributaries. This
interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope analysis. Brown
(1998) offers a different interpretation based on isotopic analyses of mussel shells from a
prehistoric site (41DL270) on Denton Creek. He concludes that the period from 1500 to
2500 yr B.P. was cooler and/or wetter and that before and after that time period, the
environment was warmer and drier. He points out, however, that this interpretation may
only be applicable for the Elm Fork tributary and not the region.

CULTURAL HISTORY
The history and prehistory of Denton County are summarized in several reports prepared
by the University of North Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990; Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring
and Yates 1997). The most commonly used chronology for the region was established by
Prikryl (1990) which divides the Late Prehistoric, the time from the use of the bow and
pottery to the Historic Native American period, into two periods: Late Prehistoric I (A.D.
700 to 1300) and Late Prehistoric II (A.D. 1300 to 1600) (Table 1).

6,000 B.C. to 4,000 B.C.
ca. 11,000 B.C. to 6,000 B.C.

Prehistoric Native American occupation in Denton County began at least 10,000 years
ago as attested to by the presence of distinctively shaped dart points (Crook and Harris
1957; Bever and Meltzer 2007) at the Lewisville site and the Aubrey Clovis site (Ferring
2001). Moreover, artifact collectors report the presence of Clovis, Folsom, Scottsbluff
and other Paleo-Indian points from the surface of sites in the region. The presence of
exotic, non-local lithic resources indicates that these early people traveled to territory
where higher quality lithics were available, or were involved in a system of raw material
trading. These early people hunted now extinct large game, but probably also foraged off
the land.
The subsequent Archaic period lasted from 7,000-6,000 B.C. to as late as A.D. 700-800.
The Archaic peoples lived throughout the county, with particular focus along the major
and minor stream valleys where they were able to hunt and gather native foods. Large
Archaic sites are generally located on terraces or ridges that overlook the Elm Fork of the
Trinity River. Smaller lithic scatters have been recorded in upland areas throughout the
county. These sites appear to be Archaic in age, but few have been thoroughly studied.
Dart points, grinding stones, fire-cracked rock, and scrapers are common artifacts found
at Archaic sites. The earliest Archaic peoples continued using exotic cherts for dart
points, but, as time passed, there was a shift toward the use of locally available quartzite
for chipped stone tools. These materials are described as Uvalde Gravels (Menzer and
Slaughter 1971).
During Late Prehistoric I, a small amount of pottery appears at the Baggett Branch site,
41DL149 (Prikryl and Perttula 1995:189). Dated between A.D. 1000 to 1300, some
pottery recorded at sites in North Central Texas has similarities to Caddoan pottery to the

east, but was locally manufactured. Genuine Caddoan and Jornada Mogollon ceramics
also occur at sites in North Central Texas (Prikryl and Perttula 1995:189). Arrowheads
appear about this same time, signaling the bow and arrow’s introduction to the hunting
toolkit. In addition, houses were found at the Cobb-Pool site, 41DL148 (Peter and
McGregor 1988:140). Fritz (1993) mentions the use of corn for food in North Central
Texas during this time and Todd (1999) suggests that the presence of mussel shell hoes in
North Central Texas indicates some form of farming.
It has been suggested that the climate was drier during the Late Prehistoric II. Bison may
have been relied upon for subsistence more than in Late Prehistoric I times. The presence
of bison-scapula hoes, especially in northern North Central Texas, suggests an increase in
horticulture. This concept is supported by the location of sites along sandy terraces
instead of the floodplain area where Late Prehistoric I sites are found. Also, pottery
similar to Nocona Plain has been recorded at sites in North Central Texas dating to this
time period (Prikryl 1990:80).
At the end of the Late Prehistoric periods, there appears to have been a general
abandonment of the North Central Texas area (Skinner 1988). Yet to the north, along the
Red River in Montague and Cooke Counties and across Red River in Oklahoma, there is
both archaeological and ethnographic evidence of historic Taovayas, Wichitas, and
Yscanis Indians (Bell, Jelks and Newcomb 1967; John 1992:204). Since the Spanish
could not subdue these tribes, they made them their allies with promises of help against
the Osages.
There is tantalizing evidence found on the Trinity River in Dallas County of a possible
visit by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto (Bruseth 1992). Artifacts found consist of a
chain-mail gauntlet, a halberd, and a spur. Current research, however, seems to indicate
that Anglo settlers were the first non-Indians to settle in North Central Texas.
The first established European settlement in Denton County began before the mid-1800s
with the establishment of the Peter’s Colony after Texas gained independence. These
early settlers were farmers who selected bottomland along the Elm Fork of the Trinity
(Bridges 1978). Denton became the county seat in 1856. Commercial farming was not
important until after the Civil War, and the early settlers were essentially self-sufficient.
Besides the plants and animals they grew, wild varieties were commonly consumed. By
1875, cotton, corn, and wheat were the main cash crops. Up to half of these crops were
grown by tenant farmers who either paid rent to the land owner for their house, tools, and
seed or by tenants who gave the landowner a third of the grain and a quarter of the cotton
or other cash crops. By the turn of the century, all of the major communities were
established and some had passed away.

Previous Investigations
The most comprehensive archaeological investigations in Denton County and in
proximity to the study area are those undertaken at Lake Lewisville, located
approximately two miles to the north. Stephenson (1949) originally surveyed the GarzaLittle Elm Reservoir, now known as Lake Lewisville. Twenty-seven sites were recorded,
though it should be noted that this initial survey focused upon recording prehistoric sites
and incorporated little subsurface testing, therefore no historic sites were recorded.
During dam construction, what became know as the Lewisville site (41DN72) was found
during a borrow pit excavation on a terrace 70 feet above the Elm Fork of the Trinity
River. Between 1951 and 1957, 21 hearths were discovered as well as Late Pleistocene
faunal remains and a Clovis point. The site dated to approximately 37,000 years BP, but
this date has been questioned, as later testing indicated that lignite contaminated the dated
samples. A revised date of circa 12,000 years BP has been more recently attributed to the
site (Crook and Harris 1957, 1961; Banks 2010).
Nunley (1973) and students from Richland College surveyed the lake edge and recorded
58 historic and prehistoric sites for the USACE. The University of North Texas
conducted an archaeological survey of approximately 14,000 acres of shoreline and
recorded or relocated 66 prehistoric and 85 historic sites, many of which had originally
been recorded by Stephenson and Nunley (Lebo and Brown 1990). Sites ranged in age
from the Archaic to 1950, and were recorded in a number of settings, including the
floodplains, terraces adjacent to drainages, upland, slopes and the ridge tops of the upland
edge (Lebo and Brown 1990: Table 6.1). Thirty-nine of the sites, almost all of which
were in the settings above the floodplain, were recommended for further testing,
including backhoe trenching, which was done the next year (Brown and Lebo 1991). Of
the 39 sites, five were then recommended for intensive testing, including both further
trenching and excavation units, which was done in 1997 (Ferring and Yates 1998).
Studies continue to be carried out at the lake to the present day, with a large area survey
conducted there in 2009 by Brockington and Associates, Inc. (TASA 2011).
Numerous smaller projects have been undertaken near the landfill as well. AR
Consultants, Inc. conducted a survey of the Lewisville Athletic Complex located less than
a mile to the west of the study area, directly across and within the floodplain of the Elm
Fork (Todd 2006). Though 6 shovel tests and 13 backhoe trenches were excavated, no
cultural resources were located during the survey, likely due to the location of the
Complex within the frequently flooded floodplain adjacent to the channel (Todd 2006:
17). Approximately one mile to the south, ARC surveyed and tested along Hebron
Parkway in 1992 (Skinner 1992). During the survey, a prehistoric shell lens site
(41DN488) was recorded on the west side of the Elm Fork, though no further testing was
done due to the area being heavily disturbed by initial construction. However, additional
extensive testing on the east bank of the Elm Fork failed to find any buried cultural
resources.
AR Consultants, Inc. has also conducted a number of surveys in the uplands and upland
edges surrounding the study area. These include a 1996 survey of the Prairie Creek

Interceptor pipeline route (Trask, Whorton and Skinner 1996), a survey along Office
Creek (Skinner 2002), and a survey of the Baruch 116 development tract (Todd 2003).
Though these surveys achieved generally negative results, the historic site 41DN523 was
recorded during the Baruch 116 survey, and consists of a partially collapsed, multistructure homestead that likely dates to the mid-20th century. AR Consultants, Inc.
performed a survey of the Valley Ridge Boulevard extension north of the proposed
landfill (Coleman, Turley, and Davis 2010). The Valley Ridge Boulevard survey
recorded 41DN576, an early to mid 20th century historic site consisting of house and
garage foundations, a well, septic tank, and trash scatter.
A search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) indicates that eight sites are
present within one mile of the 469.62 acre study area (TASA 2011). This includes three
sites that were recorded during the numerous investigations undertaken at Lake
Lewisville: 41DN30, 41DN39, and 41DN486. Site 41DN30, which sits at the confluence
of Stewart and McWhorter Creeks was recorded by Stephenson in 1949, and consists of a
lithic scatter of debris that he speculated to be a Henrietta Focus site. It was rerecorded in
1973 by Nunley. 41DN39, recorded by Harris in 1951, consisted of a prehistoric lithic
scatter and a historic house site. Though relocated by Nunley, the site could not be found
in 2009 during a survey of Lewisville Lake, and is believed to have been destroyed.
41DN486 was recorded during the 2009 survey, and consists of an early 20th century
farmstead with foundation remains and historic domestic artifacts present on the surface.
There is no information available for site 41DN242, which is located on a small knoll
north of SH 121. 41DN540 is a prehistoric site recorded in 2005 by Lopez Garcia Group
during a survey of the DFW Landfill west of the Elm Fork. It features both a shell
midden and a hearth, and was likely a mussel shell processing site. There is no
information available for sites 41DN333 and 41DN334, which sit southeast of the study
area on a ridge on the east bank of the river between an intermittent tributary and Midway
Branch. However, it may be reasonably assumed that they are likely prehistoric, given
their close proximity to the channel. No NRHP properties, historical markers,
neighborhood surveys or cemeteries are located within one mile of the study area.
Finally, a review of the Denton County Highway map (Texas State Highway Department
1936) and the USDA Denton County Soils map (1918) located no structure plotted within
the study area on either map.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Two research questions were developed to address prehistoric and historic archaeological
potential within the study area. First, the study area possesses low to moderate potential
for encountering prehistoric sites. This is due primarily to the location of the study area
mostly within the Elm Fork floodplain. The 1986 survey at Lake Lewisville recorded 66
prehistoric sites, only three of which were in the floodplain (Lebo and Brown 1990:
Table 6.1). Additionally, of the three sites recorded, no further action was recommended
on two, and only minimal testing was recommended on the third. Stephenson’s (1949)
work at Lewisville Lake (formerly Lake Dallas), investigated areas that were flooded
during the later 1990 survey. The survey showed “villages” to exist on elevations above
the floodplain, though some did extend into the floodplain. Stephenson also found
infrequent and small temporary occupation sites contained within the floodplain.
Potential is higher in the terraces overlooking the floodplain, though this type of setting
comprises less than five acres of the study area, and along Midway Creek.
The second question addresses historic site potential in the region. There is relatively low
potential for historic sites in the study area. Early farming settlers would select
bottomland locations, but later trends removed new homes and farmsteads to higher
ground. A review of historic Denton County highway and soil maps of the area showed
no structures mapped within the study area. However, a structure on the 1960 (1981
photorevised) Lewisville East, Texas 7.5’ USGS map and on more recent aerial
photography is shown in the extreme northern portion of the study area at the upland
edge. This would place it on the small area of terrace in the study area. The most likely
site types for the majority of the area are trash scatters, which could occur near any
drainage. The upland edge holds potential for other site types including farmsteads.
Methodology
The field teams walked parallel transects spaced 20 to 30 meters apart in the 118.85 acre
expansion area and made field notes about ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed
areas. Shovel tests were excavated at intervals of 150 to 300 meters along each transect
and where ground visibility was less than 30 percent. Each was excavated to the bottom
of the Holocene deposit according to THC standards (n.d). Shovel tests averaged 30 cm
in diameter, and were supplemented by an auger. The clay fill from the shovel tests was
hand sorted and sandy fill screened through 1/4” hardware mesh to determine if cultural
materials were present. Trench profiles were described following the procedures
developed by Vogel (2002) and photographs were taken. Soil from trench walls, floors,
and backdirt was screened in order to explore for artifacts. Shovel test and trench
matrices were also described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color
Chart was used to identify the specific soil colors in each test. Shovel test and trench
locations were recorded using either a Garmin GPS Map 76 or a Garmin Colorado 400t
handheld GPS receiver. Photographs were taken throughout the survey area using a
Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph 8.0 mega pixel digital camera.

RESULTS
This chapter is separated into three sections, the first describes the terrain and natural
setting of the study area. The results of the survey and trenching follow, and conclusions
derived from the results end the chapter. Though shovel tests are described generally
within the text, a complete description can be found in Appendix A.
Study Area
The survey area consists of an approximately 118.85 acre tract situated immediately
north and east of the current Camelot Landfill property. Two distinct settings are
encountered in the study area. These are the level, wooded Elm Fork floodplain, in which
the majority of the study area is situated, and the upland edge encountered in the study
area’s northeastern corner. The landfill expansion tract has been divided into Areas A, B
and C for ease of description (Figure 2). The 350.77 remaining permit acres south of the
surveyed area are developed as the existing and active Camelot Landfill. The existing
landfill operation extends from the southern edges of areas B and C down to the Elm
Fork (Figure 3). Landfill operations have been ongoing in this area for 30 years, which
negates the need for a detailed survey.

The upland edge setting in Area A features more sloping topography, which rises
appreciably to the northeast. Elevations in this setting range between 460’ on the edge of
the floodplain and 477’ msl in the northern end of the study area. This area is far less
thickly wooded. Vegetation is much the same as in the floodplain to the south, though
tree and undergrowth cover is far less extensive. Ground visibility in the southern portion
of the section was below 30 percent, but the northern two-thirds of the upland edge had a
visibility of 40 to 80 percent.
The floodplain setting in Areas B and C is heavily wooded, and features generally level
terrain, with elevations between 450’ and 460’ asl. Vegetation consists of plentiful
mesquites, scattered pecans, cedar elms, various species of oaks and scattered junipers,
with thick understory vegetation including ankle to knee-high prairie grasses, weeds,
green briar and poison ivy. Given the abundant vegetation, ground visibility was
accordingly poor, and averaged between 0 and 30 percent. However, occasional clearing
and other disturbances exposed dark gray clay soil. Topography in the floodplain is
gently undulating, with scattered, gentle rises present throughout. Midway Branch, which
flows south into the Elm Fork, traces the eastern edge of the property, and a small
unnamed tributary of Midway Branch runs through the southeastern portion of the study
area (Area C). The landfill development avoids impacts to Section 404 jurisdictional
areas in Area C, negating any present concern of sub-surface impact related to landfill
activities.

Survey Results
Area A is a narrow section that extends north-south on the west side of the landfill access
road. The southern portion of the section is mapped as Ovan clay, floodplain sediment,
and the northern section is mapped as Bastrop fine sandy loam and Crockett fine sandy
loam. Two shovel tests were placed in the northern two-thirds of Area A within the two
mapped soil of the upland edge (Figure 3). Shovel test 01 exposed Crockett soil in the
north extreme of the section; the profile recorded was characterized by brown loamy sand
to 32 cmbs, strong brown loamy clayey sand to 60 cmbs, and reddish brown to red clayey
sand to 85 cmbs. Elevation decreases sharply just south of the shovel test and allowed
the survey crew to quickly cut a profile from the slope that showed the edge of the
Crockett soil (Figure 4).

The next shovel test (ST02), revealed the Bastrop terrace soil. The profile recorded
consisted of very dark gray clayey sandy loam to 25 cmbs, strong brown sand to 46 cmbs,
clayey loamy sand to 87 cmbs, and very dark gray sandy clay to 95 cmbs. No cultural
materials were found in the shovel tests or on the ground surface in Area A. Historic
maps and aerials showed a structure at the northern end of Area A, adjacent to the current
landfill weigh station. The structure appears to have been removed or destroyed during
landfill improvements and a utility shed now sits on the location. A cut-off utility pole
that may have once served the structure is all that remains (Figure 5).

In Area B, shovel tests were excavated on eight parallel, east to west transects spaced 2030 meters apart. Four shovel tests, placed at 150 to 300 meter intervals, were dug along
each transect. A total 32 shovel tests (ST03-ST34) were excavated in Area B. The
general subsurface profile found during the testing matched what was expected for the
Ovan clay soil. Shovel tests contained dark gray to very dark gray clays or loamy clays
over dark grayish brown clays in most of the area, but the southern transects revealed a
more mottled, less stratified profile. Many of the shovel tests also contained CaCO3
(trace amounts to 10%) in the lower depths, evidence that the soil is relatively stable. No
cultural materials were observed in any of the excavated material or on the ground
surface.
The area had been cleared in the past and has recently been left to re-grow as scrub forest,
and several invasive species like mesquite account for much of the new vegetation.
Survey crews encountered several very large earthen mounds around a constructed stock
pond in the eastern half of the area. The mounds are as high as two meters, with
diameters up to 30 meters (Figure 6). Presumably, the mounds are either push piles from
clearing, construction spoil from the stock pond, or a combination of both. A small,
recently constructed shed was encountered south of the pond (Figure 7).

In Area C, shovel tests were evenly distributed throughout the approximately 20-acre
tract, with a total of six tests excavated in this area. Five of the tests (ST35-ST39) were in
the portion of the section mapped as Ovan clay, and the soil profiles observed were
analogous to those found in the southern transects in Area B. The southwest corner of
the section is mapped as Trinity clay. Despite the different soil plotted in this corner,
shovel test 40 contained a sediment profile that matches those found throughout Area C.
No cultural materials were discovered in any of the shovel tests or on the ground surface.
Area C, like Area B, was cleared in the past and left to re-grow as a forest. Growth in
this section is more advanced with many large trees and fewer invasive species than in
Area B. Midway Branch enters the section in the northeast corner, meanders southwest
into the center of the area, and it then turns southeast to exit the corner. The original
meander has been channelized from the center of Area C west to the elevated road, then
north to parallel the east side of the road (Figure 8). Although the drainage system is
modified, the old channel is still easily identifiable on the landscape. Its incision is
shallow, no more than 50 cm, and narrow at 1 to 2 meters wide. Area C extends
approximately 30 meters west of the elevated road into a recently cleared area where a
north to south pipeline has been installed (Figure 9). Ground visibility in this narrow
band was above 50 percent and no cultural materials were observed on the surface.

Trenching Results
Four backhoe trenches were excavated in the proposed landfill expansion area, one in
Area B (T1) and three in Area C (T2-T4) (Figure 10). Detailed trench descriptions are
presented in Table 2.

Figure 10.

Trench locations shown on a section of the Lewisville East, TX 7.5’
USGS map.

Trench T1 was excavated in the southwest section of Area B as a control measure to
compare those dug in Area C closer to the drainage. T1 contained a profile of dark gray
and grayish brown clays, showing an increase in CaCO3 clasting at depth; this profile
with moderately stable deep horizons was typical of what had been expected in this
floodplain location (Figure 11). Trenches T2, T3, and T4 were excavated on the west,
northeast, and southeast perimeter of Area C respectively. Rain and snow fall prior to
trenching inundated much of Area C, prohibiting backhoe excavation in the interior. The
three trenches exhibited profiles typical of floodplain settings, although there was some
variance between these and the Area B control including an 87 cm layer of construction
fill at the top of T4 (Figure 12). The primary variance is related to particle sorting.
Matrices in T1 were well sorted, containing uniform clays. In contrast, the matrices of
T2 through T4 often contained a small measure of sand and up to 10 percent pea-sized
sandstone and quartzite gravel. The disparate matrices observed in the two areas is likely
the result of location; that is, trenches T2, T3, and T4 are much closer to Midway Branch
and the upland edge to the east where they might be exposed to more energetic hydraulic
forces that carry larger particles.

Conclusions
No prehistoric or historic cultural resources were located during the pedestrian survey of
the Camelot Landfill permit boundary area. The results of the survey confirmed the
hypotheses presented in the research design that posited the low to moderate
archaeological potential of the majority of the survey area. This low potential was a
direct result of the landfill’s location primarily in the Elm Fork floodplain in which the
lack of prehistoric and historic archaeological resources has been paralleled in numerous
other studies. The upland edge in Area A was considered to have the highest
archaeological potential in the project area, but no evidence of cultural resources was
encountered. The extremely small amount of this upland setting within the project area
did not afford the survey crew enough area to encounter archaeological resources.
Almost all historic elements in this small section were removed by prior improvements.

RECOMMENDATIONS

The purpose of this investigation was to determine if cultural resources were present
within the Camelot Landfill permit boundary area, and, if so, to make recommendations
on their significance and assess how they might be impacted by construction. No
archaeological resources were found during pedestrian survey, shovel testing, or
trenching. Based upon the results of this archaeological survey, ARC recommends that
further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted in the study area and asks the
Texas Historical Commission to agree with our findings. If buried cultural materials are
discovered during the construction of the landfill expansion, work should stop in that area
immediately and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be
notified immediately. Work should not continue until the necessary investigations have
been carried out after consultations have been completed.
