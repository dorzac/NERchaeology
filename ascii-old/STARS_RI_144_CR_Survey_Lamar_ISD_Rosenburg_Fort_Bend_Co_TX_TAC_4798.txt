Abstract
In early Febuary, 2008, South Texas Archeological Research Services, LLC, conducted an archeological
survey of the Lamar Consolidated ISD new school project area near Rosenberg, Fort Bend County, Texas. Because
of the impending development of the project area into a new public school, the Antiquities Code of Texas applied to
the project, and Texas Antiquities Permit 4798 was issued for the survey by the Texas Historical Commission.
The area surveyed was the archeological area of potential effects for construction of the proposed school. It
consisted of about 14 acres of nearly flat open fields southeast of Rosenberg along Ricefield Road. Installation in
fairly recent times of gas pipelines, a large drainage ditch, associated berm, and laterals had also impacted parts of
the survey area. A segment of Dry Creek was relatively close to the area, increasing the odds that the area contained
prehistoric archeological resources.
A Texas Archeological Sites Atlas search conducted prior to fieldwork indicated that no previously
recorded archeological resources were within or adjacent to the survey area and that the area had not been
previously investigated archeologically. The survey included pedestrian visual examination of the ground surface,
survey-level subsurface testing, and report preparation. The survey revealed that the area investigated contained only
short field grasses and weeds over dark gray, gummy clay topsoil several meters thick, over Beaumont clay subsoil,
and that just prior to fieldwork, area boundaries were staked and flagged by land surveyors. Otherwise, nothing of
cultural origins was found during the survey and nothing was collected or curated in conjunction with the survey.
Based on the negative results of the survey, the Principal Investigator believed that the proposed school
project should not affect any archeological resources eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or
for designation as State Archeological Landmarks. Therefore, it was recommended to Terracon Consultants, Inc.;
Lamar Consolidated ISD; and the Texas Historical Commission, State Historic Preservation Officer that the project
should proceed without further archeological work. It was also recommended that if any archeological resources
were encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until the finds were
examined and evaluated by a qualified archeological consultant and/or the State Historic Preservation Officer.

Introduction
On February 7, 2008, South Texas Archeological Research Services, LLC (STARS), conducted the
fieldwork phase of an archeological survey of the Lamar Consolidated ISD new school project area near Rosenberg,
Fort Bend County, Texas (Figure 1), for Terracon Consultants, Inc (TCI). Because of impending development of the
project area into a public school, the Antiquities Code of Texas applied to the project and Texas Antiquities Permit
4798 was issued for the survey by the Texas Historical Commission (THC), State Historic Preservation Officer
(SHPO).

The area surveyed (Figure 2) was the archeological area of potential effects for construction of the school.
It was irregular in shape and contained about 14 acres of nearly flat prairie about 26 m above sea level. It was
completely cleared of native vegetation and used for rice production during recent decades, and it was bounded on
all sides by undeveloped agricultural land.

A Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) search conducted by STARS prior to the survey indicated that no
previously recorded archeological sites were within or near the project area and that the area had not been previously
investigated archeologically (THC 2008). However, the proximity of the project area to Dry Creek, which trended
roughly east-west a few hundred meters south of the area, increased the odds that the area might contain previously
undiscovered and unrecorded prehistoric archeological resources and prompted the survey.
The survey included pedestrian visual examination of the ground surface, survey-level subsurface testing,
and report preparation. It was conducted by Principal Investigator Herbert G. Uecker, who was assisted during
fieldwork by archeological mapping specialist Albert Uecker, RPLS, and by archeological technician Mark Kohnitz.
This report of findings conforms to the Council of Texas Archeologists guidelines for short reports in cases of
negative findings.

General Background and Setting
At the time of the STARS survey, the natural setting, natural history, culture history, and general historical
background of the project area were relatively well known and available in several excellent sources (cf. Abbott
2001; Bureau of Research in the Social Sciences of the University of Texas 1942; Johnston 1994; Henson and Ladd
1988; Houghton et al. 1991). Several authoritative histories of local communities, some of which were associated
with specific ethnic groups or families, had also been compiled (cf. Henson 1986; Henson and Parmelee 1993;
Kreneck 1989). Before the STARS survey, many of these aspects of the area, as well as the archeological
background of the area, were summarized in the archeological literature by Donachie and Moore (2003). This
section and the following one, which are adapted from and closely follow similar sections in Uecker and Molineu
(2004), contain only a summary of these topics. Interested readers are referred to Donachie and Moore (2003) and
the other references on which these sections are based, for additional information.
The major city closest to the project area was Houston. In the mid 2000s, the Houston metroplex, the third
largest in the United States, contained about 8,778 square miles and had a population of over three million people.
The city of Houston is situated within the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province about 90 km inland from the
Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf Coastal Plain is a broad outwash plain of the Southern Rocky Mountains that formed
during about the last 65 million years. The Houston area is within the Austroriparian biotic province and consists at
the local level of three principal biomes, the pine forest or East Texas Timberlands, the Coastal Prairie Area, and the
Salt Marsh flats. Pine forests are to the north and east and coastal prairies and salt marshes to the west and south.
The climate of the Houston area is subtropical humid and primarily maritime, with short, mild winters.
Other seasons are quite warm. Average summer temperature is about 93°F (34°C) and average winter temperature is
about 64°F (18°C). As is the case for many major cities in such regions, local weather in the modern urban core of
Houston is subject to the heat island effect, whereby approaching weather systems are frequently diverted around the
city by rising warm air generated principally by radiation and reflection from building and street surfaces, by heat
from motor vehicle discharges, and other artificial sources. The city’s annual rainfall in recent decades has averaged
about 45-50 inches, and occurs primarily during thunderstorms generated by the collision of encroaching gulf
moisture with dryer, warmer air masses of continental origins. Unlike regions slightly further west, where rainfall
maxima occur bimodally in the spring and fall, Houston’s natural precipitation is distributed about evenly
throughout the year and the city is often very humid and foggy. However, severe flooding occurs when hurricanes or
tropical storms occasionally impact the area.
Although the environment of the Houston area was drastically altered by modern development that
occurred during the period from the early twentieth century until the present, prior to the modern era, the area was
very diverse ecologically. The region was dissected by two major rivers, the Trinity and San Jacinto, and numerous
perennial spring-fed streams such as Buffalo and White Oak Bayous, and was the home of at least several hundred
species of plants and animals as well as numerous groups of aboriginal peoples. In general, pine forests in the
vicinity tend to be situated on acidic sand and sandy loam soil formations and prairies are found on clay and clay
loam soils. The forests are dominated by pine trees, oaks, and many other deciduous trees, and prairie landscapes are
dominated by several principal grasses including little bluestem, switch grass, Indian grass, big bluestem, and
eastern gama grass, and by a succession of woody shrubs. Even within areas dominated by clays and clay loams,
areas of sand, sandy loams, and sandstone outcrops are relatively common near springs and in other alluvial settings.
The prehistory and paleoecology of the Houston area generally mimic those of the Southwest United States
region (cf. Abbott 2001:4-39; Aten 1983:151-159). The area’s forests and its springs and stream courses were
important resource-refugium zones for human populations since at least the middle of the Holocene geologic epoch
about 7,000 years before present (B.P.; present being arbitrarily defined by culture historians as A.D. 1950). It was
at that juncture in time that the onset of the Altithermal climatic episode (Nance 1972) began to substantially alter
the climate of the North American southwest and Texas. The Altithermal was a period of relatively intense heating

and drying that lasted, with many short interludes of moderately cooler and wetter climate, until the present time. As
the lush tall-grass or mixed-grass prairies of the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain were reduced to thorn scrublands and
short grass scrub prairies over several millennia, both animal and human populations congregated in such areas as
the Rio Grande basin, the mountain forests of west Texas and northern Mexico, the central Texas Hill Country north
of San Antonio, and the Big Thicket of east Texas. During this period, native peoples would have been attracted to
the San Jacinto and Trinity River corridors and the routes of the various bayous in the vicinity of what later became
the city of Houston, as well as to the forested areas of the region. Archeological work has revealed that prehistoric
sites are indeed concentrated in such settings within the area.
In spite of modern impacts to the environment, in the mid to late 2000s, there were hundreds of species of
plants, animals, birds, and insects thriving in Houston and surrounding areas. It is beyond the scope of this report to
include a comprehensive listing or description of these species but the interested reader is referred to publications by
Abbott (2001), W. B. Davis (1960), Everitt and Drawe (1993), and Simpson (1988) for additional information about
them. Major terrestrial faunal species and avifaunal species of the general area include the white-tailed deer,
javalina, coyote, red fox, opossum, raccoon, ring-tailed cat, squirrel, striped skunk, armadillo, wild turkey, bobwhite
quail, Inca dove, white-winged dove, box tortoise, water moccasin, copper head, and eastern diamondback
rattlesnake. Prominent raptors of the region include turkey and black vultures and various species of owls; and redtailed hawks, eagles, and peregrine falcons.
Prominent plant species and communities of Houston are typical of those found throughout much of east
Texas. Loblolly, short leaf, slash, and longleaf pines are the major tree varieties in the pine forests north and east of
the city, and live oak, southern red oak, shumard oak, sweet gum, and eastern cottonwood dominate the arboreal
landscape to the west and south of the city, and along major drainages. The stream courses and river bottoms, and
the forest floors of the area contain a broad spectrum of native shrubs and forbs. Dozens of types of short and mid
grasses carpet the area's prairies and grasslands.
Local Cultural Ecology and Culture History
Greater Houston Area
Probably attracted by the abundance of pristine water, the steep ecological gradients, the rich biotic
microenvironments present in the forests and drainage basins of the area, and the relative proximity of the ocean,
humans first occupied the Houston vicinity at least 11,000 years B.P. In addition to today’s spectrum of edible plants
and animals, during prehistory, bison, antelope, and alligator would also have been present in the Houston vicinity.
The culture history of the area contains four broad divisions (cf. Hester 1980:27-37; Moore 1995; Patterson 1995;
Turner and Hester 1999:50-63): the Paleoindian period (ca. 11,000-8000 B.P.), the Archaic period (ca. 8000-1500
B.P.), the Late Prehistoric or Woodland period (ca. 1500 B. P. to A.D. 1528), and the Historic period (ca. A.D. 1528
to present). During all but the Historic period, local human populations were engaged in a nomadic to semisedentary hunting and foraging life way. Archeological evidence indicates that they were organized as small groups
or bands that traveled much of the time in regular patterns, known as subsistence forays, in order to exploit a variety
of seasonably available natural resources. This life way was practiced in most of North America for many thousands
of years before the fifteenth century infusion of Europeans to the New World. Additional information about
prehistoric subsistence and settlement patterns in the Houston area and surrounding regions is included in Hall
(1981), Moore (1995), and Patterson (1995).
Although Alonzo Álvarez de Piñeda sailed the Texas coastline as he mapped it in 1519, the first Spaniard,
if not the first European, to explore Texas in any substantial way was probably Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca.
Cabeza de Vaca was sailing the Caribbean with an exploratory Spanish expedition and was shipwrecked off the west
coast of Florida in 1528. The survivors built rafts from the resulting debris and began the arduous journey westward
along the Texas coast toward Mexico. A few, including Cabeza de Vaca, allegedly landed at Galveston Island later

that year, and for about the next eight years, wandered along the gulf coast, well into Texas, and finally arrived in
Mexico in 1536. By that time, the Spanish had conquered and subjugated many of the aboriginal cultures of Mexico,
Central America, and a sizeable portion of South America, and thus established a foothold of European-style
civilization in those areas. During the period from roughly the second decade of the sixteenth century to the terminal
seventeenth century, the Spanish colonized all of what is now Mexico to the Rio Grande. In 1691, an expedition of
Spaniards from Mexico penetrated Texas to present-day San Pedro Springs in north central San Antonio.
The landing of the Frenchman René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, on Matagorda Island in 1684 and
the subsequent activities of the French, and later, the English, in Texas, appear to have consolidated the resolve of
the Spanish to colonize the region north of the Rio Grande, including east Texas and the Houston area. Some
Spanish families had permanently settled in the vicinity of San Antonio by 1715 (Chabot 1936:8), and by 1718 the
Spanish officially established the first settlement north of the Rio Grande at San Antonio. It consisted of a mission
and a presidio based on agriculture employing Indian labor and irrigation. This subsistence pattern was used by the
Spanish throughout their New World empire.
In an attempt to thwart French incursion into southeast Texas during the mid-eighteenth century, the
Spanish began in earnest to assert their authority over the area where Houston later developed. In September, 1754,
Governor Jacinto de Barrios y Jáuregui dispatched Lieutenant Marcos Ruiz and 25 soldiers to the area near the
mouth of the Trinity River. Ruiz arrested two Frenchmen and their black slaves and confiscated contraband
consisting of clothing and munitions at one of the villages of the local Indians in that vicinity (Chipman 1992:164).
In 1755, the Spanish established trade relations with the Orcoquisa Indians who occupied the area between
the lower Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers near present-day Houston (cf. Bureau of Research in the Social Sciences of
the University of Texas 1942:8-14; Houghton et al. 1991:1-3). By 1756, the Spanish had founded the Presidio de
San Augustin de Ahumada and the mission Nuestra Señora de la Luz along that portion of the Trinity. However, by
1772, these settlements were closed and abandoned by the Spanish, who by then considered the harsh bayou country
in the Houston vicinity uninhabitable (Texas State Historical Association 2005).
Incipient Anglo-European settlement in the Houston area began in the early-to-mid 1820s when John
Richardson Harris sailed up Buffalo Bayou and established the trading post of Harrisburg near the confluence of
Brays and Buffalo Bayous. The Anglo-European presence blossomed during the late 1820s, after Stephen F.
Austin’s grant from the Mexican government was expanded eastward to include the area. Early settlements during
this period were established at Lynch’s Ferry near the confluence of Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River, and at
Morgan’s Point near present-day Baytown.
Shortly after the Texas Revolution, two entrepreneurs from New York, brothers Augustus Chapman Allen
and John Kirby Allen, purchased a league of land consisting of 4,428 acres in the vicinity of White Oak and Buffalo
Bayous. By late August, 1836, they owned 6,642 acres of bayou land in the area and had founded the town of
Houston on the west banks of Buffalo Bayou. Apparently due in good part to the aggressive marketing efforts of the
Allens, the town was virtually an instant success. It expanded during the first four months from 12 residents and one
log cabin to a population of 1,500 occupying 100 houses, and grew steadily during succeeding decades (Texas State
Historical Association 2005). Between 1837 and 1839 it was the capital of the new Republic of Texas.
Until after the Civil War when the conversion of part of Buffalo Bayou to the Houston Ship Channel began,
the economy of Houston was largely dependent upon cotton production and local trading. Shortly after the channel
was completed and opened in 1914, Houston became a deep-water international trading port that has been ranked
either second or third largest in the United States from then until the present (Texas State Historical Association
2005). Beginning in 1853, a network of railroads was established from Houston to the surrounding countryside,
including the sugar plantations of the Brazos River valley. When it reached Denison in 1873, this system became
linked to the national railways.

The discovery of oil in 1901 at Spindletop Hill was a major landmark in the development of Houston.
Refineries rapidly developed along the Houston Ship Channel and 40 major oil companies were producing in the
Houston vicinity by 1929. By 1930, Houston was the largest city in Texas. With the widespread advent of the
automobile in the Houston area, road improvements became a priority, and all-weather highways were constructed
throughout the region during the 1920s. The Gulf Freeway connected Houston with Galveston in 1952. Houston
opened its first airport in 1928. Two more major airports were opened in 1954 and 1969.
An aggressive annexation impetus in the late 1940s resulted in doubling of the area within the city. As the
population of Houston increased during subsequent decades, the city began to experience pollution, urban sprawl,
traffic jams, and land subsidence due to the extraction of ground water. Major developments during the post-World
War II era include the Astrodome sports stadium, built in 1965, the famous Galeria shopping mall, built in 1970, and
the Texas Medical Center. The medical center, consisting of 14 hospitals, and world renowned for treatment of heart
disease and cancer, was the largest employer in Houston in 1990.
The Houston Independent School District, which officially began in 1924 but was functioning as a free
public school system as early as 1877, was at this writing one of the largest in the nation. Rice University, which
began in 1912, was founded by nineteenth-century Houston entrepreneur William Marsh Rice. The University of
Houston began in 1927 as a privately funded junior college supported primarily by oilman Hugh Roy Cullen, but it
was added to the state university system in 1963. At this writing, other major institutions of higher learning in the
Houston area included Texas Southern University, University of St. Thomas, and Houston Baptist University.
At the time of the STARS survey, the modern metropolis of Houston also boasted numerous major
attractions for residents and visitors alike. These include Hermann Park, started in 1914 by George H. Hermann,
with its 32-acre world-class zoo and the Houston Museum of Natural Science; Memorial Park, which was founded
in 1924; the Houston Symphony Orchestra, formed in 1913; the Houston Grand Opera, begun in 1956; the Houston
Ballet, created in 1969; the George R. Brown Convention Center, the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, the
Houston Aquarium, and major sports teams including the Houston Astros baseball team, Houston Texans football
team, and the Houston Rockets basketball team.
Fort Bend County
The following information about Fort Bend County closely follows that in the Handbook of Texas Online
(Texas State Historical Association 2008a):
Fort Bend County is in the coastal plains of southeastern Texas. Richmond, the county seat, at 29°35' north
latitude and 95°45' west longitude, is 28 miles west-southwest of Houston and at the approximate center of the
county. The county comprises 869 square miles of level to slightly rolling terrain with an elevation ranging from 80
to 250 feet above sea level. Temperatures range from an average high of 94° F in July to an average low of 44° in
January; rainfall averages slightly more than 45 inches a year, and the growing season lasts 296 days. The Brazos
River flows diagonally northwest to southeast through the county and drains the broad central valley via numerous
creeks and bayous. The San Bernard River, which forms the west boundary, drains the western quarter of the
county. Major streams include Big Creek, which flows east into the Brazos River; Oyster Creek, which winds
parallel to and east of the Brazos River; and Buffalo Bayou, which rises in the northern tip of the county and flows
east into Harris County. Soils vary from rich alluvial in the Brazos valley to sandy loams and clay on the prairies.
Native trees include pecan, oak, ash, and cottonwood; there are some timberlands in the north and along streams.
Mineral resources include natural gas, oil, and sulfur; sand, clay, and gravel are also produced in commercial
quantities.

The settlement of Fort Bend County began in the early 1820s as part of the Anglo-American colonization
of Texas under the auspices of the Spanish government. Authorization to settle 300 families in the valleys of the
Brazos and Colorado rivers was initially granted to Moses Austin, but plans were delayed by his death in June,
1821, and Mexican independence from Spain. Stephen F. Austin assumed the responsibility of leadership from his
father and gained confirmation of the original Spanish grants from the newly established Mexican government in
1823. Following arrangements with Austin, a group of colonists sailed from New Orleans in November, 1821, on
the schooner Lively and anchored near the mouth of the Brazos River on the Texas coast.
In 1822, a small party of men from this group left the ship and traveled inland some ninety miles and, on a
bluff near a deep bend in the river, built a two-room cabin. As the settlement grew, the cabin became known as both
Fort Settlement and Fort Bend. The latter name, in time, prevailed. In 1824, the Mexican government issued
documents officially granting to the colonists their leagues of land. Of the 297 grants, 53 were issued to Fort Bend
settlers. The presence of the Karankawa Indians near the new colonial settlements proved to be a comparatively
minor problem. The first settlers had a few skirmishes, but as the colonies increased, the Karankawas began moving
out of the area and by the 1850s had migrated as far south as Mexico.
In May, 1837, the Congress of the Republic of Texas passed an act incorporating 19 towns, including
Richmond. Robert Eden Handy of Pennsylvania and William Lusk of Richmond, Virginia, both of whom had
arrived in Texas shortly before the war for independence from Mexico, founded and named the town with eight
other proprietors, including Branch T. Archer, Thomas Freeman McKinney, and Samuel May Williams. An act
establishing Fort Bend County and fixing its boundaries was passed on December 29, 1837. Wyly Martin was
appointed the first chief justice. On January 13, 1838, the citizens voted to make Richmond the county seat. The
county was taken from portions of Austin, Brazoria, and Harris counties. Its irregular shape was, in part, the result of
using waterways to form the west and segments of the south and east boundaries. Several efforts have been made to
change the lines but with little success.
Some of the first settlers in Fort Bend County played prominent roles in early Texas history. Nathaniel F.
Williams and Matthew R. Williams cultivated and milled sugar on their Oakland Plantation near Oyster Creek in the
early 1840s, thus laying the groundwork for an industry that continued to develop and thrive in Sugar Land. In 1837,
Jane Long opened a boarding house in Richmond, where she lived until her death in 1880; and Mirabeau B. Lamar
moved to Richmond in 1851 and built a plantation home on land purchased from Jane Long. Both Mrs. Long and
Lamar are buried in Morton Cemetery, Richmond. During the Texas Revolution many of the people of Fort Bend
fled in great haste as Antonio López de Santa Anna's army marched through the area. Part of this army camped at
Thompson's Ferry on the Brazos River while part marched on to meet defeat at the battle of San Jacinto. Fort Bend
settlers returned from the Runaway Scrape to find their homes plundered or burned and their livestock scattered or
dead.
Soon after its founding, Richmond developed into a prosperous trade center for the surrounding agricultural
region of the lower Brazos valley. Barges and steamboats plied the Brazos River, transporting cotton and other
products to the port at Galveston, as merchants of Richmond and other river towns vied with Houston for the
lucrative agricultural trade. Transportation facilities were greatly improved in 1853, when the Buffalo Bayou,
Brazos and Colorado Railway was completed to Stafford's Point from Harrisburg, which was located on Buffalo
Bayou's navigable channel to Galveston. The prosperity of the 1840s and 1850s, however, ended with the Civil War.
In antebellum Texas slaves were essential to the development of the valley plantations. As early as 1840,
there were already 572 slaves in Fort Bend County, and by 1845 that number had risen to 1,172, placing Fort Bend
near the top of counties with the largest slave populations. In 1850, Fort Bend was one of only six counties in the
state with a black majority. The labor provided by the burgeoning slave population made possible the growth of the
plantation economy.

In 1860, there were 159 farms in Fort Bend county, with about 12,000 acres in cotton, 7,000 acres in corn,
and 1,000 acres in sugarcane. The slave population totaled 4,127, more than twice that of the 2,016 whites. Fort
Bend planters, believing that their economic and social successes, among other reasons, justified the institution of
slavery, strongly supported the Confederacy, and, in 1861, voted 486 to zero for secession from the United states.
The majority of county men volunteered for Confederate service. Many joined the Eighth Texas Cavalry (Terry's
Texas Rangers), a regiment organized by Benjamin Franklin Terry, a wealthy sugar planter from Sugar Land.
Although battle never reached Fort Bend, the war's duration and ultimate loss imposed economic hardships
and social and political stress on the community. During Reconstruction, efforts to live in peace with politics
dominated by Radical Republicans and black officeholders brought no more than an uneasy compromise. White
Democrats, outnumbered by blacks more than two to one, were unable to regain control of local government until
the late 1880s, when their all-out campaign to attract black as well as white votes led to the Jaybird-Woodpecker
War. This brief but violent conflict, which took place on August 16, 1889, abruptly ended the Republican, or
"Woodpecker" rule, and the Democrats quickly formed the Jaybird Democratic Association. With a constitution that
declared as its purpose the "protection of the white race" and "an honest and economical government," the
association controlled local politics mainly through the white primary, which excluded blacks until the United States
Supreme Court, in 1953, supported a lower court's ruling forbidding the practice. The Jaybird Association accepted
the ruling, continued for a few years, then disbanded in 1959.
Fort Bend County remained a state Democratic party stronghold until the 1970s, when the combination of
population growth and the growing association of conservative political ideas with the Republican party broke the
trend. In a special election held in April, 1976, the county elected Ron Paul, a physician from Lake Jackson in
Brazoria County, as congressman, the first Republican elected to office in Fort Bend County since Reconstruction.
Paul focused his campaign on the evils of "big government" and the "ultraliberalism" of his Democratic opponent.
New towns and a new demography began to develop in the last quarter of the nineteenth century as
railroads branched out across the county. In 1878, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe line from Galveston crossed the
Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio (the former Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado) one mile west of
Richmond. This junction, called Rosenberg, became a community when the developers of the New York, Texas, and
Mexican Railway made it their headquarters in 1882. With the addition of the San Antonio and Aransas pass and the
Texas and New Orleans railroads, all parts of the county were served. The new lines, with routes passing through
potentially productive farmlands, attracted new settlers, many of whom were immigrants from Central Europe.
Germans, Austrians, and Bohemians comprised 400 of the 5,259 new residents entering the county from 1890 to
1900. They were primarily agrarian in orientation—small farmers or merchants serving farmers—and many were
Catholic. Their distinctly different cultural and linguistic characteristics added a new dimension to the established
Anglo-Protestant community, and their agricultural achievements contributed to the county's economic stability and
development. Among the many towns founded in the 1890s by or for these immigrants were Beasley, Needville, and
Orchard, which still exist as small rural communities serving farmers.
Missouri City, on the far eastern edge of the county near Houston, was founded in 1894. Katy, a tri-county
town in Fort Bend, Waller, and Harris counties, developed after the Missouri, Kansas and Texas (Katy) Railroad
was completed to that point. In the 1890s, a million-dollar refinery was built at Sugar Land and a new cane mill was
constructed. In 1907, they were purchased by the Imperial Sugar Company, a major industry in the county and the
only cane-sugar refinery in Texas.
In 1920 Rosenberg's population edged past Richmond's by the thin margin of 1,273 to 1,279. By 1950,
Rosenberg residents overshadowed those of Richmond 6,210 to 2,030. Two decades later, Rosenberg-Richmond, as
the "twin cities" population center, had counts of 12,098 and 5,777, respectively, in a county of 52,134 residents.
Fort Bend County population declined between 1940 and 1950; however, in the same period, Rosenberg grew by
nearly a third and Richmond held steady, a fact that reflects the national rural-to-urban movement.

Fort Bend County produces substantial minerals. Throughout the county subterranean salt domes hold
concentrated deposits of oil, gas, sulfur, and salt that made early development possible. Gulf Oil Company brought
in the first commercially producing oil well in 1919 at Blue Ridge and, three years later, located another major field
at Big Creek. Thompsons had a major oilfield in 1921. In 1926, Gulf discovered a major sulfur and gas deposit in
Orchard. The Humble Oil Company (predecessor of ExxonMobil Corporation) opened a high-producing gas field
near Katy in 1935 and later built a gas plant that produced 450 million cubic feet of gas daily in the mid-1980s.
Between 1954 and 1957, oil production in the county averaged 30,000 barrels a day, as compared to the 21,600
barrels a day in 1963. As demand for petroleum increased in the mid-1970s, developers managed to bring in 40 new
wells in 1976 and 1977, providing the county with $121 million from the sale of crude oil. Since that time a
recession in the petroleum industry has caused development in the county to drop sharply. In 1976, the top three
taxpayers in the county were, in order, Exxon, Gulf, and Houston Lighting and Power Company; in 1983 the top
three taxpayers were Houston Lighting and Power, Exxon, and Utility Fuels. Gulf dropped to fourth place.
Farming and ranching have been the central focus of Fort Bend County economic and social life since its
inception. The influx of new settlers in the 1880s and 1890s helped county agriculture change from antebellum
plantations to productive small farms. The county had 2,365 farms with 183 acres each in 1900, in contrast to 995
farms with 154 acres each in 1890. The national recession of the 1890s, a major flood on the Brazos River in June
1899, and the great Galveston hurricane of 1900 forced many farmers into tenantry. By 1910, 61 percent of the
county's farmers were working as cash or share tenants. By 1925, of the 3,659 farms in the county, approximately 72
percent were operated by tenants, a partial result of a statewide economic recession and adverse summer weather
from 1919 to 1922. During the World War II years, with the rural to urban movement and military service, farm
tenantry dropped, and full ownership of farms increased. Since the 1960s, home developments, industry, business,
and commerce in the county have forced a trend toward fewer commercial farms.
The 1974 Census of Agriculture reported 1,340 farms in the county, but only 758 of these reported cash
sales in excess of $2,500. Among the four top agricultural commodities for cash income in the mid-1980s were
cotton, sorghum, beef cattle, and rice. Cotton culture, a source of income for nearly 700 families in the county,
varies greatly with seasonal weather, allocated acreage, and selling prices. Sorghum culture has increased in recent
years due to favorable selling prices and more consistent profit. Total value of the crop in the county in 1976 was
$11 million. Rice culture began as early as 1901 with plantings on acreage once considered worthy only of grazing.
Rice yielded 18 to 20 bags an acre in 1903. The 1990 annual acreage was just above 25,000 acres, with a yield of
4,488 pounds per acre. In 1982, agriculture provided more than $90 million in average annual income for the
county.
Ample grazing land and free-roaming herds of longhorn cattle encouraged the first settlers in Fort Bend
County to combine cattle raising with farming. The Fort Bend County Book of Brands indicates that landowners
with minimal acreage tried to turn a profit in the cattle business. As elsewhere in Texas, the boom years of the 1870s
and early 1880s culminated in the bottom falling out of the market by 1886. Local cattlemen began fencing their
pastures and upgrading their herds with shorthorns, Brahmans, and Herefords. Today, more farms in the county
produce cattle than any other cash crop.
Until the last decade commerce and industry have been associated with the development and transport of
oil, gas, and sulfur in the county. Local businesses provided agricultural needs and products and services for the
communities. As the population increased in east Fort Bend County, a result of Houston's westward expansion,
industry and commerce became more diverse. Among the top 10 commercial taxpayers in Fort Bend County in 1983
were three property-development corporations and two high-technology corporations.
In the last decades of the twentieth century, Fort Bend was among the fastest-growing counties in the
United States. Between 1980 and 1990, the population nearly doubled, from 130,960 to 225,421. In 1990, 62.6
percent of the population was white, 20.7 percent black, 19.5 percent Hispanic, 6.4 percent Asian, and 0.2 percent

American Indian. The largest communities were Rosenberg (20,183), Houston (with 27,027 in Fort Bend County),
Missouri City (32,219 in Fort Bend County), and Sugar Land (24,529). Two major social and cultural events
characteristic of the county and its people are the Fort Bend County Fair, first held in 1933 and still held annually
each October; and the Fort Bend County Czech Fest, first held in 1976 as a spring tourist attraction and continued
annually each May.
Rosenberg
The following information about Rosenberg closely follows that in the Handbook of Texas Online (Texas
State Historical Association 2008b):
Rosenberg is 28 miles southwest of downtown Houston, and on U.S. Highway 59 in central Fort Bend
County. The area was originally settled by Stephen F. Austin's Old Three Hundred around 1823. Richmond, the
county seat, inadvertently gave birth to the city of Rosenberg by refusing right-of-way to the Gulf, Colorado and
Santa Fe Railway. In 1880, the railroad built three miles to the west of the Richmond area and established a station
at the crossroads of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe and the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio railroads. At
Rosenberg, Joseph Telfener, an Italian count, established the headquarters of the "Macaroni Line," the New York,
Texas and Mexican Railway building toward Victoria. The Union Depot was built in 1889. The town was named in
honor of Henry Rosenberg, a Swiss immigrant, who settled in Galveston and from 1874 to 1877 was president of the
Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway Company.
Soon after the coming of the Macaroni Line and the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway in 1883, Santa
Fe purchased 200 acres from the Henry Scott league and platted and squared them off around a city square between
the river and railroads, at the site of the present Jackson Intermediate School on Third Street. The town at that time
had a store, a saloon, and Mrs. Ebell's hotel, although most residents lived in tents. In 1881, a post office opened,
and in 1894 a Wells Fargo shipping office came to town. A new resident, R. T. Mulcahy, raised funds to build the
first school, the first of many community enterprises that earned Mulcahy the nickname "Father of Rosenberg."
Between 1890 and 1900, the population increased to 1,000, with the coming of the Czechs, Germans, and
Poles. The Rosenberg Progress was purchased by George B. Lang, who changed its name to the Silver X-Ray. Two
black churches, Mount Vernon Missionary Baptist and St. Luke's Methodist, were started in 1882 and 1883
respectively, and were still active in the late 2000s. The First Methodist Church was organized in 1895, and the First
Baptist Church was started in 1896. By 1898, Rosenberg had incorporated its school district, and voters passed a
bond to build a new school.
In 1902, the "City of Mud" was incorporated into the city of Rosenberg. Robert H. McCormick was the
chief proponent of incorporation and became the town's first mayor. R. T. Mulcahy completed McCormick's
unfinished term. The town got its first telephone, located in the Cumings Drug Store, in 1902, and a Masonic lodge
was established in 1903. By 1906, there were 100 telephone subscribers, enough for Pat Roberts to set up a
Southwestern Bell Telephone switchboard in Kubena's Boot Shop in the Moers Building. In 1912, the first electrical
generating plant was built, and Rosenberg had 56 businesses.
Rosenberg suffered floods in 1913, 1922, 1929 and 1957. Although the 1913 flood was particularly severe,
the town rebuilt and continued its progress. In 1914, a volunteer fire department was started, and C. H. Waddell
established the Fort Bend telephone company in Needville. In the early 1920s, major oilfields were developed in
Fort Bend County, and Rosenberg became a boomtown. The first hospital was built in 1922. Following the
discovery of sulfur at nearby Orchard, workers in the sulfur industry also augmented the population. In 1945, the
town estimated 3,457 residents and 128 businesses. By 1956, the total had almost doubled to 6,210 residents and
234 businesses. The growth continued through the 1960s and 1970s. Rosenberg had a population of 17,900 in 1980
and 21,577 in 1990. In 2000, the population was 24,043.

A strong mineral and petroleum industry produces petroleum, sulfur, natural gas and its derivatives, salt,
clay, sand, and gravel. Farming and agribusinesses are also important in the local economy. The area produces
livestock, cotton, rice, sugar, sorghums, pecans, feed, and some vegetables. The town provides low site and
construction costs, varied transportation facilities, inexpensive fuel, low living costs, good schools, and ample
recreational facilities as well as an abundance of historical sites, museums, and memorials. Rosenberg has a daily
newspaper, the Herald-Coaster, and a radio station, KMPQ. Its residents support 47 churches of 17 communions. In
1946, Rosenberg and Richmond formed the Lamar Consolidated Independent School District, which serves more
than 13,000. There are also two church schools, one Catholic and one Episcopalian. The community holds the
Rosenberg Czech Fest on the first weekend in May and the Fort Bend County Fair in October.
Archeological Context
Fort Bend County is in the Eastern Planning Region as defined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (ed. 1993:4). The
east Texas region and Fort Bend County are rich in archeological resources; however, the scope and findings of the
STARS survey of the project area merit only brief mention of those resources in this report. Readers interested in
additional information about the regional archeological background of the project area are encouraged to consult
Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document (Kenmotsu and Perttula ed. 1993) and the
other referenced cited in this section.
A check of the Atlas at the time of the survey revealed that about 230 archeological sites were previously
recorded in Fort Bend County (THC 2008). Among these sites were approximately 17 designated state archeological
landmarks. Most of the sites previously recorded in the county were of prehistoric origins and were discovered since
about the late 1960s in conjunction with surveys triggered by archeological compliance requirements under federal
and state antiquities laws. However, in recent years archeological investigations conducted in adjacent Harris
County in conjunction with several major downtown Houston renovation or construction projects resulted in the
discovery and recording of numerous sites that originated during the Historic period (cf. Carlson 2001; Donachie
and Moore 2003; Molineu et al. 2003; Uecker and Molineu 2004). Moore (1995) formulated a predictive model for
the occurrence of prehistoric sites in Harris County and the Houston-Harris County area was recently the focus of a
comprehensive overview of regional geoarcheology by Abbott (2001).
Soils
According to the Web Soil Survey for Fort Bend County, Texas (United States Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources Conservation Service 2008a), soils within the project area consist primarily of Bernard clay (Bb)
and Bernard-Edna complex (Be):
The Bernard series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils
that formed in thick clayey sediments on marine terraces of Pleistocene age. These soils are on
broad Coastal Prairies. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.
TAXONOMIC CLASS: Fine, smectitic, thermic Vertic Argiaquolls
TYPICAL PEDON: Bernard clay loam--cropland.

slow internal drainage; very slow permeability. The soil is saturated within 2 feet of the surface
during the winter and early spring.
USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for growing corn, cotton, grain sorghums, and rice
[United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 2008b].
The Edna series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that
formed in thick clayey sediments. These soils are on broad Coastal Prairies. Slope is dominantly
less than 1 percent, but ranges up to 5 percent along narrow drainageways.

GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Edna soils are on broad, nearly level coastal prairies. The soil formed
in clayey sediments of the Pleistocene age Beaumont Formation.
DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Permeability is very slow.
Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes, medium on 1 to 3 percent slopes, and high on 3 to 5
percent slopes. Water perches on top of the argillic horizon for periods of 2 to 4 weeks following
extended heavy rain.
USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for growing rice and for native range for beef cattle.
Native grasses are mainly prairie grasses of species of Andropogon, Paspalum, Panicum, and
Sporobolus. Oak, elm, and Hackberry trees have encroached in some areas [United States
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 2008c].
Methods and Results
At the time of fieldwork, the project area consisted of grassy fields cleared in recent decades for
agricultural purposes, and contained several gas pipelines and easements that obviously also originated in recent
times. The area was not fenced, but boundaries had just been staked and flagged by land surveyors. A drainage ditch
about 4-5 meters wide and three meters deep (Figure 3), and an associated berm were present along the northern
boundary. About a dozen lateral ditches each extended several meters south of and perpendicular to the main ditch.
Each of the lateral ditches was only about a half meter below the average grade of the fields and was cut transversely
through the berm, which averaged about 3-4 meters high and 6-8 meters wide.
Ground surface visibility was poor to zero in most of the project area at the time of fieldwork due to the
presence of a thick mat of short winter field grasses and weeds. Accordingly, in addition to conventional pedestrian
visual examination of the surface on about 15-20 meter transect intervals and careful visual inspection of the main
ditch profiles, 15 archeological shovel tests were excavated within the area (Figures 2 and 4; Table 1). Each shovel
test was about 30 centimeters in diameter and the tests averaged about 80-100 centimeters deep. Screening of
excavated matrix was not feasible due to the high water saturation level resulting from recent rains and the greasy
consistency of clays, but most of the matrix was troweled through and carefully examined for the presence or
absence of cultural evidence. All shovel tests encountered very dark gray (about 10YR2/1) gummy clay from the
surfaces to the bottoms, and except for small plant roots and detritus near the surface, excavated matrix was virtually
devoid of visible natural inclusions. In each case, excavations were stopped at the depth at which water began to
pool in the bottoms of the pits.
Other than the afore-described agricultural fields, drainage ditch, berm, laterals, and gas pipeline easements
within the project area, all of which obviously originated during very recent times, and the land survey flags and
stakes placed along the boundaries of the area just before fieldwork, nothing of cultural origins was encountered,
and nothing was collected or curated in conjunction with the survey.
Interpretations and Recommendations
Based on the negative results of the survey, the Principal Investigator believed that the proposed school
project should not affect any archeological resources eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or
for designation as State Archeological Landmarks. Therefore, it was recommended to TCI, Lamar Consolidated
ISD, and the SHPO that the project should proceed without further archeological work. However, since no survey is
100 percent foolproof, it was also recommended that if any cultural resources were encountered during construction,

per applicable antiquities statutes and regulations, construction work should immediately be halted in the vicinity
until such finds were examined and evaluated by a qualified archeological consultant and/or the SHPO.
