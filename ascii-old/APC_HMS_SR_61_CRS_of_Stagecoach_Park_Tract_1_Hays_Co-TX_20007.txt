Abstract
The City of Buda, contracted with Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC), Kyle, Texas, to conduct
a cultural resources survey of Tract 1 of the proposed Stagecoach Park. The survey was conducted during
March 2007 in accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1969 (NHPA), as amended.
The area surveyed covered 1.892 acres. The results of the cultural resources survey were positive;
one new archeological site was recorded. Site 41HY433 is a multi-component historic site made up of
archeological deposits and features associated with the Onion Creek Post Office (built 1875-6) and the
McElroy-Severns House (built 1886+). The deposits have high research value related to early Onion Creek
settlements, Post Road/Old San Antonio Road, and Central Texas stage and mail stops. The deposits
contribute to the eligibility of the structures and are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. No diagnostic nineteenth century artifacts were
recovered. Although, artifacts were present in shovel test, no diagnostic items were found and therefore, no
artifacts were curated.
The findings of the survey demonstrate that significant archeological features that must be avoided
and that eligible deposits are located inside Tract 1 of the proposed Buda Stagecoach Park that could be
affected by the construction. The features will be preserved in place and incorporated into the historic park’s
design. APC concludes therefore, that no archeological features or deposits that are eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places and/ or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark will be
impacted by the Tract 1 park development, as proposed.
APC recommends that construction of the proposed park proceed, as planned, without additional
archeological work or consultation. In the future, if plans are changed and excavation, digging, and/or
trenching of any sort is proposed, the affected areas should be subject to archeological testing and possible
data recovery before digging begins. If any archeological features such as cisterns, privies, and/or cellars are
uncovered during park development, work should stop at the location, and the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) should be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. The find must be evaluated by a professional
archeologist in consultation with the THC.

1.0 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The City of Buda in partnership with Nighthawk Frozen Foods proposes to build the 53-acre
Stagecoach Park located along Onion Creek. The focal point of the park and its entry will be the historic
McElroy-Severns House and the Onion Creek Post Office located in Tract 1 of the proposed park. The
structures are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and designated as State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs). However, an archeological survey of the tract has not yet been conducted. For this
reason, and because the development is on land owned by the City of Buda, an archeological survey with
shovel testing was performed inside the 1.895-acre tract in accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code. The
survey was augmented by monitoring of floor removal and footing installation at the McElroy-Severns
House. In addition, preliminary archival and historical research and oral history were performed.

Survey results were positive, early twentieth century artifacts and nineteenth and twentieth
century features were identified and designated as temporary Site 41HY433. A small amount of
household refuse was recovered from shovel tests located on the east and south side of the house.
The deposits are discrete and stratified and contribute to the eligibility status of the structures.
Additional household items were observed during monitoring after flooring was removed from the
rear and eastern portion of the McElroy-Severns House. Materials consisted primarily of kitchen
items. All materials date from the 1920s-1990s. No diagnostic nineteenth century artifacts were
found. Although upper archeological strata are disturbed, features are and lower strata are not.
Initial reviews of deed records and census data show that the area of Onion Creek near the
Hays County crossing of the Old San Antonio Road/Post Road has been occupied since the mid­
1850s. Deed research demonstrates that persons important to local history are associated with the
tract and are S.V.R. Eggleston, Richard Wells, A.N. Hopkins, Martha F. Good, Boone and Zoe
Heep, T.E. McElroy, and John Severns. Preliminary research also raised questions about historic
activities in the tract that should be studied further in the future. Foremost is the construction date
of the two buildings. Second, is the multi-purpose use of the name “Onion Creek” for various
communities in Travis and Hays counties and/or a variety of post office locales.
Several recommendations may be drawn from the results of the survey. The archeological
deposits at Site 41HY390 are eligible for listing in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. APC
recommends that construction be allowed to proceed with conditions. Archeological testing should
be performed at locales inside Tract 1 in the future where any digging, trenching, or blading is
proposed. Lastly, if at any time in the future historic or archeological deposits are exposed by
restoration or development activity and/ or by vandalism by park visitors, the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), Archeology Division should be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. The
discovery and/or vandalism of archeological and historic NHRP and SAL deposits must be
evaluated by archeologists and/or architects in consultation with the THC.

2.0 STAGECOACH PARK TRACT 1
The City of Buda plans to develop Stagecoach Park on land it owns located on North Loop 4. The urban
park contains two tracts and has been developed in two stages. The second stage consists of the development of
Tract 1, a 1.895-acre upland tract with historic structures. The tract has not been surveyed by archeologists,
although it contains two properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a State Archeological
Landmarks. For these reasons, Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC) was contracted with to perform a
pedestrian survey of Tract 1 in accordance with Texas Archeological Survey Standards. Archival and historical
research and monitoring was conducted following the survey and results are summarized in this report that meets
standards of the Council of Texas Archeologists.
Tract 1 consists of a large 1.895-acre lot with two historic structures and one modern out building (Figure
1). The project includes the renovation of the historic McElroy-Severn House ( built ca. 1886), the stabilization
of the Onion Creek Post Office (built ca. 1876)(Figure 2) and limited development around the structures (Figure
3). Both buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and as State Archeological
Landmarks (SALs). Most impact will be to the interior and exterior of structures, not the grounds around the
buildings, with the exception of clearing vegetation and unearthing and/or exposing certain cement features. At
the time of the survey, work on the structures had begun, foundations were uncovered and add-on roofing was
removed. In addition to the historic structures, a modern chicken coop is in the tract that will be demolished.
Archeological deposits located around the buildings were examined to see if intact deposits are present.The tract
is located in northeast Buda, Texas, in Central Texas (Figure 4). The 1.895-acre locale is urban and has been
occupied since at least 1875. It contains the frame McElroy-Severn(s) House (built after 1886) and the limestone
Onion Creek Post Office (built ca. 1876). Entry to the park and house, hike and bike trail, and parking are
planned inside Tract 1. Some parking is located in Tract 2 and was surveyed in 20003 and is not included here.

The project area is situated on a low north-south trending ridgetop and its north slope that overlooks the
flood plain of Onion Creek to the north and an intermittent stream to the east. Elevation range from 700 ft above
mean seal level (amsl) to 670 ft amsl. Ridgetop vegetation consists of many mature oaks older than 100 years
it age. Cedars, elm, and hackberry line the intermittent creek. Ornamental plants in the yard and native plants
outside the yard make up the sparse under story. The ground surface is deflated and visibility ranges from 30 to
80 percent. Soils consist of shallow very dark brown silty clay over reddish-brown clay sitting on decomposing
limestone bedrock. The soil unit mapped for the tract is Gruene clay (1-5 percent slope) in the uplands and Tinn
clay , frequently flooded, is present along the intermittent creek. The houses and property have been unoccupied
for more than 10 years. Recently the lot was cleared of brush and trees were trimmed.

3.0 CULTURAL HISTORY
INTRODUCTION
The lengthy culture history of the Central Texas archeological region is recognized as quite rich and
possesses a variety of archeological and historical resources (Alexander 1963; Black and Creel 1997; Brown and
Anthony 1989; Collins 2003; Prewitt 1974; Ricklis and Collins 1994; Suhm et al. 1954; and Weir 1976; 1985).
The Onion Creek drainage contains numerous known historic and prehistoric archeological sites (Davis and
Jones 1994a, 1994b; Garber 1992a, 1992b; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Evidence of human occupation from the
region now spans 10,500 years and includes, but is not limited to, prehistoric food processing areas, burial sites,
stone quarries, and campsites and historic farmsteads, stage stops and roads , post offices, and rock walls.
Chronology
For archeological purposes, regional culture history falls into two gross categories: prehistoric and
historic. The term "prehistoric" refers to the time that encompasses more than 10,500 years, generally before
A.D. 1550, for which no written history exists. Historic periods are those times for which written accounts and
documents exist, generally after the year A.D. 1550. Within the gross categories, a temporal framework made
up of broad time periods has been derived from area investigations, including in Hays County by Ricklis and
Collins (1994) and in Bell County to the north by Collins (2003). The framework consists of the four temporal
stages that have been subdivided into stages and are summarized in Table 1.

The park will be built inside a tract that has historic significance related to early colonists, settlers, and
transportation. The proposed park is in the boundaries of a Mexican land grant acquired in 1835 by Steven
Eggleston (Giberson and Younts 2003:212). The first groups of colonists settled on Onion Creek west of Buda
near Driftwood (Stoval et al. 1981). As early as 1848, the Tarbox and Brown Austin to San Antonio stage coach
route included the location that would become Buda. Stages carried passengers and mail daily. Leaving Austin,
the eighth landmark on the trip was the home of Colonel Dick Well, now the city of Buda (Dobie 1932). One
historic ford at Onion Creek is at the low water crossing west of the 1880 railroad bridge (CR 236), ca. onequarter mile to the east of the Onion Creek Post Office/Severns Stagecoach House. Another historic route known
to be used by stage coaches is the present-day Old San Antonio Road segment from Buda to Manchaca and
Manchaca Springs one-quarter mile east of the park locale). During wet periods, the stage coach route west of
Buda was used and during dry periods the favored route was the prairie to the east (Stoval et al. 1981:360).
Onion Creek was the name for the locations of several post office locales where mail was dropped. The
earliest were west of Buda at Driftwood, Elm Grove, and Mountain City. The Onion Creek Post Office of interest
here served most of northern Hays County from ca. 1875-1880, and in 1875 the Post Master was George W aters,
according to Giberson and Younts (2003:276).The arrival of the railroad brought platted communities at regular
intervals, similar to stage stops, including Buda. At first, the community was known as DuPre and it was platted
six months after the railroad arrived in 1880. In 1887, the new name of Buda was adopted for the new railroad
town to eliminate duplication. Between 1885 and 1898, the McElroy-Severns house was constructed by Ada and
T.E. McElroy Sr., a couple who owned most of the land northeast of Buda (Giberson and Younts 2003:277).
Other sources, including the Texas Historic Sites Atlas place construction at 1885.

Local histories and anecdotal accounts contain numerous references to the ownership of land along
Onion Creek, including Tract 1 and the stage coach house. In 1906, widow Ada McElroy sold the land to John
and Ann Severns who held the property until their deaths in 1919 and 1921 (Giberson and Younts 2003:278),
hence the naming of the house.
I remember Ronnie’s father A.W. Franke, who owned the old “stage coach house”, the land
where President Johnson’s grand parents settled.(close to Night Hawk Frozen Foods and south of the
Santa Cruz Catholic Church) and the land where the Allen Family Cemetery is located (Giberson
2003:131-132).
A General and Mrs. Whitaker held the property for a number of years, according to Younts (2003:278).
The house has been vacant since at least ca. 1989 and was acquired by the City of Buda in 1996-1998. Table 2.
contains ownership data derived from historic and anecdotal accounts and from the proposed park survey plat.
This data needs to be confirmed by detailed archival and historical research and gaps need to be filled in.

Previous Archeology
Archeological investigations have been conducted in the Middle Onion Creek Valley (Ricklis and
Collins 1904). Archeological surveys have been conducted at the neighboring Heep Ranch, Jardine Foods, Inc.
plant, and the Night Hawk frozen foods plant (Davis and Jones 1994, Garber 1992a, 1992b). The archeological
survey of the county road right-of-way leading to the Jardine property was negative (Garber 1992b). Surveys
have been performed downstream at the neighboring Heep Ranch (Davis and Jones 1994a1994b). Upstream form
the proposed park, archeological investigations have been conducted in the Middle Onion Creek Valley ( Ricklis
and Collins 1994). Findings demonstrate that Onion Creek played an integral part in the settlement of Hays and
Travis Counties in both prehistoric and historic times.
The survey of the Nighthawk Facility resulted in the recording of one site, 41HY190 and the
documentation of a prehistoric artifact scatter. Site 41HY190 is a scatter of historic household debris, a stone
alignment, cut limestone blocks, and a possible subterranean feature. According to Garber (1994b:3), the stone
alignment is strikingly similar in appearance to the nearby Allen Cemetery (41HY189). The prehistoric artifact
scatter was observed throughout the 10.49 acres surveyed at the Nighthawk plant. The scatter was uniformly
distributed, surficial, and consisted of flakes, shatter, small cores, and broken crude bifaces. No artifact
concentrations or diagnostic artifacts were observed. Further work was recommended at the site which was
avoided by the development.
North of the study area, at the Heep Ranch, segments along Onion Creek have been visited by
archeologists (Davis and Jones 1994a, 1994b). As early as 1941, archeological sites were recorded on the ranch
and fifty years later, the systematic looting of the sites became a problem for the landowner. Site 41TV16 is a
burned rock midden that is associated with Scallorn, Darl, Bulverde, Nolan, Pedernales, Ensor, and Travis
projectile points. One single pot sherd was collected from the site. Site 41TV19 is a habitation site with midden
remains associated with Meserve, Travis, Pedernales, Nolan, Lange, Marcos, Darl, and a few arrowpoints.
Artifact assemblages and features such as these indicate that the campsites along Onion Creek were occupied
by prehistoric groups for at least 10,500 years.
In addition to significant archeological sites, the Heep Ranch as it is known today contains several

Page 7

historic ranch houses and the site of the historic Manchaca Springs (Davis and Jones 1992;1994). The home built
by Boone and Zoe Heep ca. 1929-30 on Travis County FM1327. The W.T. Ruby/Woods House is likely the
oldest structure on the Heep property and in 1994 was in very dilapidated condition and considered a ruin (Davis
and Jones 1994:17). Elements of nineteenth century construction reported by Davis and Jones (1994:17) include
cut limestone block exterior chimney, wood shingles, two-over-two pane with very thin glass, hand-hewn cedar
log ceiling rafters, and cut nail use. There is also a bell shaped cistern under the back porch and a hand-dug well
behind the northeast corner of the house. This locale was not recorded as an archeological site, despite its
nineteenth century age which might be as early prior to 1870. The second historic structure discussed by Davis
and Jones (1994:13) is the Rylander House located on North loop 4 near the junction with Post/Old San Antonio
Road and east of the McElroy-Severns House.
Also present in the vicinity of the project area is the brick Birdwell House (built in the 1925) on the south
side of North Loop 4 and is located just east of the original Herman Heep home that burned (Giberson and
Younts 2003:50). East of the house is a modern frame structure. To the southeast of the Birdwell house is a
standing frame house with a pyramidal roof with central chimney from the late nineteenth/early twentieth
century; its windows and exterior are boarded over with metal siding. The Rylander -Hehl House was built in
1903 and was located on the south side of Loop 4 (Giberson and Younts 2003: 267). It was built by Buckner
an Lula Adair Rylander. For years Justice of the Peace Orlena Hehl Giberson and Younts : 279) and it was torn
down during the recent Walmart development.
The survey of Tract 2 of the City of Buda Stagecoach Park covered ca. 51.6 acres in the flood plain along
Onion Creek below Tract 1, to the north (Godwin 2005). The results of the cultural resources survey were
positive; one new archeological site was recorded. Site 41HY390 is a sparse prehistoric artifact scatter. It has
low research value due to disturbance and is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. No historic sites were found and no historic structures
were observed during the survey of Tract 2.

The project area is located in the historic Eggleston League along the banks of Onion Creek and is an
area that is known to contain historic buildings, cemeteries, and prehistoric archeological sites. APC proposes
to inventory cultural resources in accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code and to identify any significant
cultural resources present for avoidance purposes. The survey scope will include the an intensive pedestrian
survey to visually inspect 1.89 acre tract with shovel testing, as needed, monitoring, and preliminary archival
and historical research.
Research Direction
The survey area is located in the Edwards Plateau region of Central Texas on Onion Creek and is an area
known to contain many archeological sites. The overall purpose of the survey is to collect new data about
local and regional cultural history. The overall goal of the survey is to identify, inventory, and describe any
archeological deposits present that could be affected by the proposed action. Other specific goals are related
to the known historic components at the locale. First, anecdotal accounts of ownership will be verified and a
preliminary chain of title will be determined through archival and historical research. Second, subsurface
examination will be used to identify contents and determine relative dates of deposits and to determine the need
for additional significance testing. Third and lastly, artifact analysis will be performed for artifact recovered
from controlled shovel tests to determine if any deposits represent discrete components.
Methods
APC prepared an application for and obtain an Antiquities Permit from the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) before starting any work. Survey work consist of multiple stages of work.
Background research, intensive pedestrian survey with systematic shovel testing, site mapping,
photodocumentation, and preliminary archival and historical research will be performed. Monitoring of the
removal of floor boards and installation of concrete footings will also be performed. APC reviewed records from
the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the THC, and Texas State Library (TSL). Site files and pertinent
archeological literature were reviewed. Maps and indices were checked to determine if any historic properties
listed on the National Register of Historic Places, State Archeological Landmarks, and/or recorded sites are
inside the project area. A review of data collected by APC from the Stagecoach Park Tract 2 survey was
included.
Preliminary archival and historical research was performed at the Hays County Clerk’s Office and the
Hays County District Court office in San Marcos in order to construct a chronology and line of ownership of
the 1.895 acre tract. Anecdotal accounts and historic accounts were verified, whenever possible, by searching
historic records. Deed, probate, census, city directories, aerial photos, and historic maps were researched, as
needed. Former owners and/or persons knowledgeable about the property were sought out. Oral history accounts
were taken from A. W. Franke’s son Ronald Franke and long-time City of Buda Secretary Annette Chambers.
The intensive pedestrian survey complied with Texas State Survey Standards and covered 100% of the
tract. The survey was conducted by two archeologists in a 3-4 day period.. In addition, APC conducted
systematic shovel testing in grid pattern inside the tract around structures and features, as needed. A total of 18
shovel tests was dug to delineate the horizontal extent of buried deposits present and examine the vertical extent
of deposits. Shallow soil profiles were exposed and described. No artifacts were recovered that were judged to
be scientifically redundant will be subjected to limited field analysis and left in place. No temporally or
stylistically diagnostic artifacts were recovered, therefore, no collection was made. Shovel test locations were
mapped and backfilled.

5.0 RESULTS
INTRODUCTION
Archeological deposits were found during the pedestrian survey of Tract 1 that are associated with the
McElroy-Severns House and the Onion Creek post office. The structures and the archeological deposits were
designated Site 41HY433. During the survey, archeologists monitored work done by stabilization contractors
including removal of floors, porch removal, and foundation repair. A scatter of early twentieth century household
materials litter the ground surface beneath the McElroy-Severns House, rear and east wing. Archival and
historical research revealed a long chain of ownership of the property, the house, and the Onion Creek Post
Office building back to the early days of Texas statehood. Persons integral to the founding and settlement of
Buda were associated with the house and the property making up the park. Due to time and budget constraints,
questions arising about the construction dates of structures were not answered and needs to be addressed in the
future.
SURVEY
The results of the intensive pedestrian survey were positive. One new archeological site was recorded.
Site 41HY433 consists of archeological, historical, and modern deposits and/or features associated with the
McElroy-Severns House (1896-1898) and the Onion Creek Post Office (1876). One late nineteenth century well
is present ca. 25 feet form the northeast corner of the house on the side of the property closest to the intermittent
stream. Historic roads beds and/or driveways thought to be stage coach roads are present in the south and
southeastern part of the site. Four twentieth century features are present made of concrete and native stone. They
are two sidewalks, two retaining walls, and one subterranean concrete architectural feature that can be described
as an open “box”. In the north east corner of the site is a concrete dam/low water crossing. Shovel testing
demonstrated that two discrete twentieth century deposits from the 1920s and 1970s-1980s are present at the site.
No evidence of a privy, cistern, or cellar was found in the yard behind the houses. No late nineteenth century
materials were recovered from shovel tests or observed during the monitoring of foundation work beneath the
floor of the McElroy-Severns House.
Site 41HY433
Environmental Setting. Site 41HY433 is situated on a low ridgetop that overlooks the flood plain of
Onion Creek to the north and an intermittent stream to the east. It sits at elevation 705 ft above mean seal level
(amsl). Ridgetop vegetation consists of many mature oaks older than 100 years it age. Ornamental plants and
native plants make up the sparse under story. The ground surface is deflated and visibility ranges from 30 to 80
percent. Soils consist of shallow very dark brown silty clay over reddish-brown clay sitting on decomposing
limestone bedrock. The soil unit mapped for the site is Gruene clay (1-5 percent slope). The houses and property
have been unoccupied for more than 10 years. Recently the tract has been cleared of brush and trees have been
trimmed that might fall on the structures. The McElroy-Severns House is undergoing stabilization and renovation
for use as a park building/interpretative center.
Site Description. The site is roughly rectangular and measures 628 feet (200 m) north to south by 471
feet (150 m) east to west (Figure 5). Cultural materials surround the structures and features. Beneath the floor
of the McElroy-Severns House and around the Onion Creek Post Office artifacts from the 1920s were present
in moderate to dense numbers. The materials can be described as Art Deco and are likely associated with the
Heep occupation of the property (1921-1929). To the north of the houses and yard, the property has been cleared
by machinery and a burn pile (10ft east to west by 6 feet north to south by 3 feet tall is present. It contains
abundance of glass and aluminum beer bottle and cans, brick, miscellaneous metal objects, fence post, barbed

wire. The beer bottles and cans are from the 1970s-1980s and they are associated with the Stanzel ownership
(1971-1989) of the tract, when it was rental property. Archival and historical research revealed that the property
has a long detailed history of ownership and was associated with persons important to local and regional history.
Features
A total of three features has been identified. They include a nineteenth century well, an early twentieth
century subterranean concrete vault/box, and a nineteenth century stage road. No evidence of cisterns, cellars,
privies, septic features, stables, and/or corrals were observed. Also present are modern sidewalks, retaining
walls, and driveways. A garage was present to the northwest of the McElroy- Severns House, but was torn down
by the time of the survey. The large barn located to the northwest outside park and the frame chicken coop

Page 11

located northeast of part of Tract 1 are reportedly affiliated with the Whiteaker/Franke occupation.
Feature 1. Feature 1 is a 15-foot deep hand-dug well lined with stacked limestone rock (Figure 6). The
well is located about 15 feet northeast of the kitchen portion of the structure. It is one of the earliest features on
the tract and is probably nineteenth century in age. It measures 3 feet in diameter with a stone curb. It contains
a 1-inch diameter galvanized metal pipe starting about six inches blow the curb, extending into the well. The
pipe appears to connect the well to Feature 2 which is located about three feet to the north. The same pipe is
present adjacent to the masonry building and extends above the ground about 3 feet and extends and/or the
addition to the back of the building. It appears that the below-the-ground well may have been filled in later time
by an above the ground water well pump.

Figure 6. Overhead Photograph Showing, Feature 1, a Hand-Dug Well with Galvanized Water Pipe Fixture.

Page 12

Feature 2. Feature 2 is a subterranean concrete “box” with drains and metal water pipe that connects
it to the well and to the early twentieth century “pump house” at the back of the masonry building (Figure 6).
Its function is not yet known; it could be a cold box to keep items chilled or it could be a settling or holding tank
for water piped to and/or from the pump house locale, the box, and the well. Feature 2 is about 24 inches deep.
It is rectangular and measures 3.6 feet north to south by 2.5 feet east to west from the edges of the concrete
walls. The eastern and western side of the walls of the feature contain brick-shaped openings for drainage
(Figure 7). It is probable that cool well-water chilled foods and beverages stored in the box. Similar concrete
features are reported at dairies on the Heep farm by Davis and Jones (1994). The addition on the back of hte
Onion Creek Post Office is a “pump house” , among other things and contained an electric water pump, and
a natural gas outlet, and a hot-water heater. It appears this was the hot and cold water system for the house and
was probably added on during the Whiteaker occupation from 1933-1958 and in use through the 1970s when
the property was rented.

Water Pipes Connecting it to Water Wells.

Page 13

Feature 3. Feature 3 is the remains of a historic road bed, thought to be a segment of the late nineteenth
century stage route (Figure 8). It consists of two open lanes with a 200-300 year old oak at the center and around
them. A loop is formed by the lanes that are about 20 feet wide. The broad lanes enter the property from the
east after they cross the intermittent stream that forms the boundary of the eastern park. In the vicinity of the
park are several low water crossings of Onion Creek and its tributaries which may have been used by stagecoach
traffic which routes were varied in wet and dry weather to the post passable one. Also present on the Jardine
tract to the west are slough-like features, that may in fact be the remains of historic road beds. Unfortunately,
the portion of the road bed north of Loop, has recently been impacted by the installation of a new sewer line and
lift station. Loop 4 drainage was also improved in the 1940s by the state highway department.

Shovel Testing
Shovel tests were used to locate evidence of intact, buried late nineteen century deposits and/or features
and were laid out checkerboard-fashion (Figure 8). The shovel tests covered the front and back yards of the
structures and the open area downslope and to the north of the backyard. A total of eighteen shovel tests were
dug during the survey. Shovel test depths ranged from 3 cm below the surface (bs) to 40 cm bs. Shallow clay
loams over clay over bedrock were encountered. Artifact recovery was quite sparse compared to the numbers
of artifacts on the surface.

Page 14

The artifact collection recovered from shovel testing is made up of routine household items such as
undecorated dinnerware, decorative glass, and clear glass. During monitoring, many early twentieth century
materials litter the ground surface. In the eastern portion of the McElroy-Severns House was the location of an
early kitchen, based on the artifacts, such as silverware, and butchered meat bones present. The amount of bone
under the house indicates the presence of a dog(s) and a preference for beef.

Figure 8. Portion of Buda, Texas USGS Map Showing Survey Area and Shovel Test Locations.
Shovel testing revealed that although sparse in nature, stratified, intact archeological deposits are
present. Modern materials from the 1970-1980s are present on the surface away from and around the structures.
Beneath the McElroy-Severns House is a surficial component made up of household debris from the 1920s­
1970s. Some of the debris surrounds the masonry structure as well, and 1920s-1930s household debris was
exposed by stabilization activity. No shovel tests were dug under the house., as new concrete piers and footings
were built on top of the existing surface and no excavation took place. Materials located at 20-30 cm bs, in
Shovel Test 7 may be late nineteenth century in age.
Three of the tests (6, 7, and 17) were positive and fifteen (5, 8-16, 18) were negative. Materials
recovered from level ST 6 in Level 1 (0-10 cm bs) included one piece of depression ware glass and in Level 2
( 10-20cm bs) one piece of clear glass. Shovel Test 7 recovery was sterile in Level 1 (0-10cmbs), and 2 pieces
of white ware ceramics were found in Level 2 (20-30 cm bs). These could be late nineteenth century in age and
represent the earliest buried component at Site 41HY433. In Shovel Test 17, one prehistoric chert flake was
found in Level 1 (0-10 cm bs). In sum, shovel testing yielded five artifacts, four historic artifacts and one
prehistoric artifact, and no new feature data (See Appendix I).

ARCHIVAL AND HISTORICAL RESEARCH
Onion Creek has long attracted settlers to the area. This was in part due to its spring-fed streams and
fertile farm lands, its location near major transportation routes of the time, and proximity to the state capitol.
Late nineteenth century military roads were laid out to connect posts between Austin and San Antonio. Often
routes followed existing trails and roads, including Spanish roads established in the 1700s and later. Segments
of the stage coach road associated with the McElroy-Severns House and Onion Creek Pos Office building is
known today as (Old San Antonio Road or OPR). Following the initial subdivision of the S. V. R. Eggleston
League No. 3, three waves of migration into the region occurred from the mid-1850s, to 1870s, to the late 1880s.
Settlement and Settlers
Issuance of patents for head right leagues brought colonists to the region in the 1830s. The opening of
Post Road in 1841 brought travelers who liked the scenic area and springs and stayed. In the mid-1850s and
early 1860s, westward movement of frontier brought. An influx of new arrivals came with the end of the Civil
War. In the late 1860s and as the frontier moved steadily west in 1870s, settlement began in earnest. In 1880,
the railroad trestle at Onion Creek was completed and the townsite of Dupre was created and a real estate boom
ensued. By the mid-1850s Buda-area settlement was well-established. A plantation and agricultural economy
grew up in the vicinity of the project area. Early settlers in the area, such as the Robbins, Rubys, Wallings and
their descendants stayed until after the Civil War. The 1860s-1870s brought new families and freed slaves
stayed and began farming in the region. The arrival of the railroad in 1880 brought the first influx of
“townspeople” to newly platted railroad towns of Dupree (Buda) and Kyle.
The Allens and the Labenskis made their home in northern Hays County in 1850 at what would become
Buda and at Elm Grove, respectively (1850 Census Page 119). In 1860 the area was designated by census
enumerators as Subdivision 12. Families living in the vicinity of the Eggleston League who received their mail
at the Manchaca Post Office were the Robbins, Harris, Bainter, Walling, Ruby, Kelly, Labenski, Malitsky,
Crews, Goforth, Gatlin, and Hughs households (1860 Census:27). The area was delineated as Precinct 5 in 1870
and the post office was at Mountain City. The families living in the area were named Good, Woods (at the Ruby
place), Trimble, Stephenson, Carpenter, McWilliams, Needham, Goforth, Labenski, Ruby, Martin, and
Barrett(?) (1870 Census:240-242).
In 1880, the area was called Precinct 2 and household names included Goforth,. Henick, Franks, Everett,
Williams, Gatlin, Good, and Esmerosa. Census records from 1880 also revealed clues about the location of the
construction camp for the International & Greater Northern Railroad (IGNRR) trestle over Onion Creek (1880
Federal Census Page 71). The camp was in place in June of 1889 on the north side of Onion Creek at the low
water crossing at the north of Main Street leading to Manchaca. It was probably located east of the railroad rightof-way between and was between the dwelling of the Rubys on one side and the Nivens and Hamiltons on the
opposite side. Robert Reed of Scotland was the contractor for the effort. About 70-80 workers lived at the camp
in three locales. The railroad workers were from northern and southern US states, Texas, Canada, Scotland,
Ireland, and Mexico. Deeds from the Rubys and the Nivens and the IGNRR should be reviewed for more
location details. By the mid-1890s, settlement was well established, but roads were not paved (Figure 10).
Post Road/Old San Antonio Road
Roads were integral to the settlement of Central Texas and influenced migration waves into northern
Hays County and the distribution of early communities. One such road of interest here is known today as South
Congress Ave. in Austin and the Old San Antonio Road in Manchaca, Buda, Kyle, and San Marcos (Figure 9).
Originally it was called Post Road and connected military posts in San Marcos and Austin. Post Road was one
of the few roads constructed during the Texas Republic period (Stovall 1986:70) and it shortened the route of
the well-established El Camino Real (also known as the “King’s Highway”, “Old Bastrop Highway”, and Hays
County Road 227). According to Stovall, the construction was overseen by Captain Wiehl’s, Company H, First
Regiment of Infantry and crossings were prepared at Williamson, Slaughter, Onion, and Plum Creeks. It was
in operation in 1841, when the Texas Republic army was disbanded and Post San Marcos was closed; troops
marched back along the road to discharge in Austin (Stovall 1986:71).
By 1848, the road was used by the Tarbox and Brown Stage Line to deliver mail and passengers (Dobie
1932). Stage stops evolved along the route, approximately every 10 to 12 miles. The most often repeated
journey on the route is that of D. P. Hopkins relayed by Dudley Dobie in his 1932 masters thesis. The stage left
the Sunshine Hotel in Austin at Sixth and Congress. Four miles south of the Colorado River , Williamson Creek

Page 16

was crossed, then Slaughter Creek. A few miles farther Onion Creek was crossed and then the stage stopped at
the stand at the Weir place at Manchaca Springs. Next the stage came to what is now Buda passing the homes
of Dick Wells, J.A.P. Carr, John Trimour, to the W .W. Haupt’s stage stop at Old Mountain City. In 1850, one
third of Hays County’s population resided along Onion Creek (Schwartz 1986:346).

Crossing, and Communities.
Historic Chronology.
The property upon which the McElroy-Severns House and the Onion Creek Post Office sit has a long
history of ownership beginning with a Mexican Land Grant to Stephen B. von Eggleston (Table 3). Eggleston
was one of Ben Milam’s Colonists first six colonists who came Mina (Bastrop) from North Carolina with his
wife, Juila Ann, and their six children (Stovall et al. 1986:359). The league was divided between the heirs and
widow, Juila Ann Eggleston conveyed 1,111 acres to Richard Wells of Travis County in 1856 for $1111, $611
of which she loaned to him (Hays County Deed C:194).

Page 17

W ells subdivided the acreage and conveyed many tracts the same year. Among purchasers were Austin
investor/speculator/merchant/undertaker A. N. Hopkins and early Onion Creek settlers. Hopkins died in 1863;
his estate was administered in 1868 by his widow, Cornelia Amelia Brownrigg McGaffey Hopkins Trimble,
known as the founder of Dupre/Buda (Braume and Franke 2006).
Wells sold 832 acres in the southwest quarter of the league to brothers Constantine and Andrew N.
Hopkins (Hays County Deed C:194), a husband of Cornelia Ann Trimble, founder of Dupree/Buda. A. N.
Hopkins subdivided the property and sold about 277 acres or one quarter of a quarter league of land to Issac Kelly
(Stovall et al. 1986:363). Hopkins was gunned down in a dispute in at his casket store on Congress Avenue in
Austin in 1863 (Braume and Franke 2006). In 1868, Cornelia with then husband David Trimble administered
the Hopkins estate (Giberson and Younts 2003:245), which included about 554 acres of land on Onion Creek,
being the southwest quarter of the southwest quarter of the Eggleston league.
The earliest known residents of the parcel where Stagecoach Park is located were Joseph and Elizabeth
Robbins from 1856(?)-1861. Where they lived for about five years in the 277.5-acre tract that they owned is not
yet known. Others who purchased the former residence of the Robbins were O. M. and Dora Smith, who flipped
the property to J. M. and Emma Hamilton (Hays County Deed D:326; F:128). The Hamiltons owned the property
during and immediately after the Civil War when they conveyed 234 acres to H. W . McMahon (Hay County
Deed F:127). During the Hamilton, occupation the amount of acreage was reduced by 39 acres, from 277 to 234
acres. In 1871, Martha F. or J. Good purchased the 234 acres , with husband John H. Good (Hays County Deed
H:733).
During the Good period of ownership, it is reported that the Onion Creek Post Office was built (Giberson
and Younts 2003). The nearby Allen-Good Cemetery was also constructed and in use at this time. The location
of the Good homestead is not yet known. The Good family intermarried with the Allen Family, founders of Buda.
During this time, the nearby Allen (Allen-Good) Cemetery was dedicated by 1876 (Hays County Deed J:268).
Members of the Allen, Good, and Severns families area buried in the cemetery. If the masonry building known
as the Onion Creek Post Office 1876 was constructed during this time period, it was built during the Good
occupation. It is presumed the Goods lived in the tract, but it is not yet known where. Was the masonry building
a dwelling? Was a frame house present near the masonry building?
Martha J. Good sold the acreage to Austin merchant George W. Sampson (Hays County Deed J:267) who
held it from 1876 to 1882. Sampson deeded land for the railroad right-of-way in 1880 (Hays County Deed
N:237). S. G. Babcock bought the 234 acres in1882 (Hays County Deed Q:253) and sold it to T. E. McElroy in
1886 ( Hays County Deed U:564). The McElroys owned the tract from 1886 to 1906 and aggregated it with other
parcels to form the 481-acre “McElroy Place”. It is believed that the McElroy-Severns house was built between
1886-1888 (Giberson and Younts 2003). The Severns took possession of “the McElroy Place” in 1906 and lived
in the house until 1921, when it was sold to Boone and Zoe Heep (Hays County Deed 82:514). The Severns
broke up the McElroy place and sold parts of the 481 acres, including 143.82 acres sold to the Heeps.
In 1929, the Heeps sold to O. T. and Dora Moore of Caldwell County (Hays County Deed 97:414); the
Moores flipped the property to M. F. White (Hays County Deed 97-639). In 1933, the Whites sold to B.B. and
Velma D. Cowden (Hays County Deed 105:403). The Cowdens sold the property to R. O. and Eva Dabney
Whiteaker in 1937 ( Hays County Deed 114:68). The Whiteakers occupied the property until 1958, when they
sold the house and 143 acres to A. W. Franke (Hays County Deed 176:12). After Mr. Fanke’s death in 1971,
the property was sold and partitioned. Stanzel Rentals purchased 71.70 acres (includes Stagecoach Park Tract
2). Victor and Joe Stanzel purchased 71.72 acres (includes Stagecoach Park Tract 1, Nighthawk tracts, and church
property) ( Hays County Deed 247:79). The City acquired ca. 52.296 acres of the Stanzel property for Stagecoach
Park.

McElroy-Severns House
Tom E. (Sr.) And Ada McElroy bought 234 acres from Babcock (Hays County Deed U:564) and
additional acreage in the area to put together the 481-acre “McElroy Place”. Tom McElroy ran gin located
northeast of Buda (Stovall et al. 1986:397). It is during this period that it is believed the McElroy-Severn House
was built in front of the Onion Creek Post Office building. Unfortunately, budget and time constraints prevented
the review of tax records, mechanics liens, and other documents that might shed light on the construction date
of the frame structure. Additional archival work is needed in the future to address this topic. Other long-time
owners of the house and adjacent property at the turn of the twentieth century, were John and Ann or Nancy
Severns who held 142.82 acres from 1906-1917 ( Hays County Deed 51:136). In 1917, the Severns conveyed
their 143.82 acres to H.F. Severns (Hays County Deed 71:84).
Boone and Zoe Heep acquired the house and property in 1921 (Hays County Deed 97:414). Boone was
the son of Fred Heep and brother of Herman. The Heeps were an imminent early twentieth century Buda/Hays
County farmers, ranchers, dairymen, and oilmen. Boone and Zoe lived in the house during the first years of their
marriage (Giberson and Younts 2003: 179). They also became leading ranchers and dairyman in South Travis
County. Newspapers dating from 1922-1927 found under a layer of linoleum in the McElroy-Severns House were
apparently laid down after the later part of the Heep occupation, by the Heeps or the Whites who held the
property form 1929-1933. In her memoir “Zoe’s Story”, M rs. Heep talks about her first home with Boone.
According to ?, the McElroy Severns house was the first home they purchased. Zoe states that they married in
1917 and lived with her Heep in laws near Buda during the first year of the marriage. After their financial
situation improved, she remembers the following:

Page 19

... we bought a place, a beautiful old home across the street from Mother Heep in Buda. It was
built before the Civil War, and it’s still standing there. We lived there until Kathryn was seven (Crosby
1983:43).
Deed records show that the Boone Heeps owned the McElroy-Severns House from 1921-1929. In 1917,
the Fred and Alma Heep home was “just” east of the location where the Birdwell-Turner House was built in 1925
on the south side of Loop 4 (Giberson and Younts 2003:48-50). The Birdwell-Turner House was built after the
two-story Fred Heep Home burned. Mrs. Zoe Cage Heep’s account is the only written comment found that
alludes to an earlier date of construction for the McElroy-Severns House than previously thought. The style of
the house is quite similar to that of the Joe Bob Rodgers, Sr.s home in the Dripping Springs community
constructed in 1879. Could this reference be about the McElroy -Severns House or could it have been about an
earlier structure, perhaps the Good House of the 1870s? or the Richard Wells House of the 11850s? Mrs Heeps’
comment was made in 1982, when she stated that it was still standing. Much more detailed research is needed
to answer these questions and verify Mrs. Heeps account/memory.
Boone and Zoe Heep moved to their third home located on FM1327 which they built in 1928; they sold
the 143.82 acres with houses to O. T. and Dora Moore (Hays County Deed 97:414), who turned the property to
M. F. and Willie White less than a week later taking a slight loss (Hays County Deed 97:639). In 1933, B.B. and
Velma Cowden purchased the property (Hays County Deed 105:403). R.O. and Eva Dabney W hiteaker bought
the house and land in 1937 and lived there until 1958 (Hays County Deed 114:68). The Whiteakers were known
for keeping the property like a show place (Gibberson and Younts 2003: 278).
Mr. A.W. Franke bought the property in 1958 (Hays County Deed 176:12), and older people today refer
to the property as the “Franke Place” (Hardy 2007). The Frankes refer to the McElroy -Severns House as the “Old
Ranch House”. It was vacant from 1958 to 1971 (Ron Fanke 2007). The Frankes lived in the rock house and
frame house on the tract adjacent to the west of the proposed park, known today as “Stagecoach Antiques” and
PDQ Realty (Chambers 2007). After Mr. A.W. Franke died, the property and structures were purchased by
Victor and Joe Stanzel of Fredricksburg, probably for investment purposes. The Stanzel’s divided the property
into two tracts (Hays County Deed 247: 79,83); a total of 70.72 acres was put into rental property and another
71.70 acres was placed in a trust. The City of Buda purchased 52.296 acres of the Stanzel land for Stage Coach
Park. Tact 1 of the Park falls in the trust holdings and the bulk of Tract 2 falls in the rental holdings.
Onion Creek Post Office
Scwhartz (1986) is quoted directly here to explain the locations and name of the Onion Creek Post
offices locations in the Buda Area. Schwartz also provides a map from the United States Postal Service that
shows the locations of post offices near Onion Creek and the Hays/Travis County lines (Figure 11). The map
shows the 1875 location of the old and new Onion Creek Post office, the Manchaca Post Office, and the
Mountain City Post Office. The map shows that the Onion Creek Post Office locations were north of the
Manchac Post Office at that time. Manchaca Springs is located south of Manchaca or “Manchac”, Texas, and
was referred to as “Onion Creek” for periods of time. Post office locations near the Onion Creek community at
the Post Road/Old San Antonio Schwartz is quoted below and are summarized below with dates of operation,
postmasters, and locations in Table 4.
After the road was completed between Austin and San Marcos, the traveling was made easier.
As mentioned before, the stage stop was at Manchaca Springs. By 1867 the Manchaca Springs post office
had a postmaster. John S. Spence, who was appointed on Dec., 12, 1867. The name of the stage stop and
the post office at Manchaca Springs was changed to Onion Creek, Texas, post office.
On April 3, 1875 the Onion Creek post office and stage stop were moved to one fourth mile east
of the present downtown Buda on Loop North 4. George W. Waters was appointed the postmaster. It was
still called the Onion Creek, Texas, post office.
The combination post office and stage stop was built of native stone.
The Manchaca stage stop and post office was located near the property of the Hays Youth
Athletic Complex.
After the railroad came to Hays County, the Manchaca stage stop and post office was moved
again to the site of the present town of Manchaca (Schwartz 2003:365).
The masonry building known today as the Onion Creek Post Office has a lintel that is engraved with the
date 1876. If this is correct, the building served as post office until 1881. At that time, the Onion Creek post office

Page 20

name and location was changed to Dupre, Texas, which was renamed Buda in 1887 (Stovall et al. 1986). It is
interesting to note that members of the McElroy family served as Buda Post Master in the late 1890s in to the
early 1900s (Wheat 2007).

In summary, although archeological deposits are sparse, initial reviews of records and census data show
that the Onion Creek area near the Hays County crossing of the Old San Antonio Road/Post Road has been
occupied since the mid-nineteenth century. A small community of farms and plantations were present in the early
1850s in the S.V.R. Eggleston League that continued into the 1860s. After the civil war, ownership changed
hands, plantations were eliminated, and a farming economy developed. In 1880, the railroad arrived and crossed
Onion Creek, spurring the growth of railroad communities, such as Buda (formerly known as Dupre). The rural
landscape was becoming “urban” by 1880, as town lots were laid out near the railroad, and by 1890, residences
and farms were well established in the vicinity of the park. Deed research conducted to date demonstrates that
some historic personages important to local history are associated with the tract are S.V.R. Eggleston, Richard
Wells, Marthat Good, and Cornelia Trimble.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Tract 1 of Stagecoach Park is a known significant historic locale that contains archeological deposits
associated with the McElroy-Severns House and the Onion Creek Post Office. The intensive pedestrian survey,
shovel testing, monitoring, research, and oral history conducted during the Buda Stagecoach Park Tract 1
archeological survey contributed a wealth of new data about late nineteenth and early twentieth century life ways,
civic growth and economic development in northern Hays County. In addition, new questions were raised about
data not found during the study, in particular, the construction dates of extant structures and verification of the
presence of earlier structures in the tract. Obviously, an historic themed passive, park is the highest and best use
for such a tract. However, future park design and development should avoid blading, cut and fill, trenching,
and/or excavation until additional archeological investigation is performed.
Based on the results of the shovel testing, APC concludes that although modern and historic land uses
have impacted components at Site 41HY433, but discrete early twentieth century deposits and possible late
nineteenth century deposits are discernable. Intact late nineteenth and early twentieth century features are present
near the masonry building. Despite the presence of late nineteenth century features, no diagnostic artifacts from

Page 21

that period were recovered. The late nineteenth century archeological deposits likely to be present under and
adjacent to the buildings, but have been obscured by early twentieth century activity and materials, which litter
the ground surface. A cistern, privies, cellars, septic, and other subterranean features from both centuries may
be present in the back yard of the house and should be preserved.
The archeological deposits and features at Site 41HY433 can contribute new data about local and
regional history when studied. Features 1 and 2, the well and cold box, are in good condition and will be
preserved in place. Portions of Feature 3, the stage coach road have been previously impacted by modern road
and sewer installation. Overall, the road bed inside Tract 1 is quite discernable, its condition is good, and the
remainder merits preservation in place.. For these reasons, the late nineteenth features and the early twentieth
century deposits contribute to SAL and NR eligibility status and must be protected and preserved in place. Based
on the results of the archival and historical research, more in depth research is needed in the future, unrelated to
the current park development, to identify construction dates of the structures.
APC recommends that development of Tract 1 of Stagecoach Park be allowed to proceed with conditions.
First, impacts to all historic Features 1 and 2 should be avoided. Second, Feature 3, the stage coach road segment,
should be incorporated into park plans and the historic landscape associated with the structures. Third, the SAL
boundary and NR boundary should be modified to include historic road routes inside the park. Fourth, because
late nineteenth and early twentieth century features may be present, no excavation or digging should take place
inside Tract 1 until additional subsurface archeological investigation in the form of shovel testing and/or
significance testing is conducted. Fifth, and lastly, if at any time in the future historic or archeological deposits
are exposed by restoration or development activity and/ or by vandalism by park visitors, the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), Archeology Division should be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. The discovery
and/or vandalism of archeological and historic deposits must be evaluated by archeologists and/or architects in
consultation with the THC.

City of Buda Stagecoach Park; TAC Pennit 4416
Site 41HY433: Discovery

!11{ y Z<-­
Dear Mr.:Oaks,

/

At the request of the City of Buda, Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC) perfonned
additional survey work at the Stagecoach Park in Tract 2. An historic well (Feature 4), a set of
three modem concrete blocks (Feature 5), and a prehistoric artifact concentration (Area B) were
found that are part of Site 41HY433. Site 41HY433, Area B, contains significant prehistoric
archeological deposits that includes a knapping station, a Plainview Paleo point fragment ca.
8,000 - 10,000 years old, and Archaic period bifaces 6500-8000 years old.
Although the context of the deposits is mixed historic and prehistoric, the contents of the
deposits have the ability to provide new data about area chronology and lithic technology. For
these reasons, the archeological deposits in Area B are judged to be contributing factors to the
sites' National Register and State Archeological Landmark eligibility status. Impacts to the Area
B deposits should be avoided. If avoidance is not possible, additional archeological work is
necessary to mitigate impacts. In addition, Feature 4 is a contributing factor to the eligibility of
Area A and historic structures and should be avoided and preserved in place. Feature 5, however,
a set of concrete blocks, is not a contributing factor to eligibility and may be removed.
Area B should be treated by capping it with clean fill at least 4-6 inches deep. The
playscape should be constructed above-the-ground. If it cannot be placed on a pad, it is
recommended to eliminate it from Area B and/or move it. Do not dig in Area B and minimize
surface disturbance when removing silt fencing and laying sod or spreading filL While uncovered
and bare of vegetation, park personnel should periodically monitor the locale for artifact
exposure, erosion impacts, and metal detecting, surface collection, and/or digging activity by the
public or subcontractors.
In closing, as a result of the significant discovery a new recommendation is fonnulated
for Tract 2 development. City Parks and Recreation Director Danny Zincke, who is
knowledgeable about prehistoric deposits, should periodically monitor excavation of the proposed
pond in Tract 2. Any buried artifacts and cultural horizons discovered during pond excavation
should be reported to the Texas Historical Commission and evaluated for significance. At this
time, concurrence is requested that installation of the playscape can proceed according to the
conditions listed above.

ATTN: Mr. Mark Denton
RE: City ofBuda Stagecoach Park; TAC Permits 3703
Dear Mr. Oaks,
On February 11, 2008, Danny Zincke, City of Buda Parks and Recreation Department, notified
Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC) that an historic feature and a prehistoric artifact scatter were
revealed after brush and undergrowth were cleared from the eastern boundaries of Tract 1 and Tract 2 of
the Stagecoach Park. The eastern boundary is an intermittent stream and minor tributary of Onion Creek.
The purpose of this letter is threefold. The first is notify your agency of the discoveries and second, is to
report findings of a site visit made December 11, 2008, by a representative from APe. Third and lastly, is
to make recommendations regarding the discovery during construction.
The results of the site visit confirmed the report. Inside Tract 1, a late nineteenth or twentieth
century well obscured by vegetation is now visible. The feature is in good condition and lined with native
limestone cobbles. It has a more recent cement top and cap (Attachment 1). Its use could date from 1890s­
1950s, and may be contemporaneous with the cement dam across the stream. Inside the northeast comer
of Tract 1 and the southeast portion of Tract 2, is a prehistoric artifact scatter is present. It is surficial and
measures ca. 40 m north to south and 30 meters east to west. A portion of the locale was shovel tested
during the Tract 1 survey, but with negative results. The newly found scatter is concentrated and contains
fragments of diagnostic stone tools (Attachment 2) and lithic cores and debitage. The scatter is made up
of initial reduction cores and flakes, broken bifaces, biface blanks, and a thin biface distal tip. Severla
artifacts have been burned. Many decorticate thinning flakes are also present, indicating that the entire
reduction sequence is present at the locale. The scatter falls in and out of site 41HY 433 in Tract 1 and
Tract 2. The site is not associated with site 41HY390, found in Tract 2 under TAC permit 3703.
The final report for TAC permit 4416 has not yet been submitted. It is recommended that a survey
of the newly cleared areas be performed and that the findings be included in the final report, as an
addenda. The well should be documented and assigned a feature number for site 41HYl33. The
prehistoric scatter should be documented and included in site 41HY433. The boundaries of the site need
to be enlarged and the site map revised. A site revisit form should be filed with the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory.
At this time, concurrence is requested that additional work should be performed
under TAC Permit 4416.

INTRODUCTION
On February 11, 2008, Danny Zincke, City of Duda Parks and Recreation Department,
notified Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APe) that an historic feature and a prehistoric
artifact scatter were revealed after brush and undergrowth were cleared from the eastern
boundaries of Tract 2 of the Stagecoach Park (Figure 1). A small, level terrace overlooking the
floodplain and below the ridgetop was exposed Surface visibility is now 100 percent. The ground
surface is covered in a 5 cm thick humic layer with a dense leaf duff and has been churned by
recent hand-clearing activity, exposing the artifact concentration. Small outbuildings have been
removed and areas are now exposed that were not accessible during the previous surveys.
METHODS
An intensive one hundred per cent survey with shovel testing of the newly cleared area
was conducted by APC personnel. The new discoveries were located inside the boundaries of Site
41HY433 and extended north outside the site. The discovery is in the southeastern part of Tract 2
(Figure 2). Pedestrian transects five meters apart and random transects were walked in cleared
areas. All artifacts observed on the surface were collected by transect. The first transect was the
easternmost and at the base of the slope. The second transect was mid-way up the slope and the
third was on the upper portion of the slope. Third, the terrace was collected and fourth, the
floodplain below the terrace. Lastly, a separate random collection was gathered after a heavy rain
for limited analysis. The limits of the artifact concentration were determined to be on a bench or
second terrace of the creek at 965 ft amsl that measures about 20 meters in diameter. It overlooks
the creek and is below the ridge top to the south where the structures are located.
Four controlled shovel tests were dug in Area D, where the playscape will be installed
and the most artifacts were found during the surface collection. The purpose of the shovel testing
was to determine content and depth of the artifact concentration (Figure 2). They were placed in a
grid pattern; five meters apart. The tests were dug in 10 cm increments to depths of 30-40 cm
below the surface. Of the four shovels tests, fill from three were dry-screened through V4 inch
mesh. One was water screened through 1/6 inch mesh in order to recover small artifacts and any
micro-artifacts present. Artifacts from the surface collection and the shovel tests were subjected
to limited field analysis. The specimens are not diagnostic and were not curated.

RESULTS
Pedestrian Survey
Survey results were positive and showed that site 41HY 433 is multi-component site with
historic and prehistoric components. The historic component and structures make up Area A,
while the prehistoric component is Area B. Two new historic features were observed that are
associated with the McElroy-Severns House. Feature 4 is an early to mid-twentieth century creek
side sump/well (Figure 2). Feature 5 is also twentieth century in age and is a group of three large
thick cement blocks placed mid-slope between the ridge top and the creek bottom (Figure 3). The
uppermost block contains a centrally located rebar for re-enforcement or for anchoring.
A prehistoric loci was delineated inside the newly cleared area and named Area B.
Prehistoric lithics, including bifacial tools, were exposed on the surface after the humic layer was
disturbed by clearing. Flaking debris from early to late stage reduction are present in moderate
numbers. A sparse number of small burned rock fragments area associated with the artifacts. The
concentration is measures 25 meters north-to-south by 20 meters east-to-west. It is situated on a
bench or second terrace overlooking the tributary and below the ridge the historic structures sit
on. Elevation ranges from 696 ft amsl to 698 ft amsl.

Surface Collection (n=95)
Three surface collections were made inside Area B (Table 1). The ftrst was a random
surface collection (n=15) was made by city personnel before the survey. Historic and prehistoric
materials are mixed and present within 5 cm of the surface in a thick layer of humic layers. A
total of 8 items were collected and are 9 historic items and 6 prehistoric artifacts (Figure 3). The
historic pieces are metal and are a chain and a grouping of machine-cut square nails. The
prehistoric specimens are two thin biface distal tips, three thick biface preforms, and one early
stage biface blank.
The second was a 100 percent surface collection (n=50) in Area B. During the second
collecting period, a one hundred percent surface collection was made inside Area B. Of the
specimens were collected, 16 or about 32 percent are historic and 34 or 68 percent are prehistoric.
The historic collection contains 11 bottle, window, and decorative glass fragments and 5 ceramic
dinnerware sherds. The prehistoric collection is made up of I quartzite hammerstone, 1 medial
perfonn ftagment, and 32 flakes and broken flakes. The third was a random sample (n::;=30)
from
Area A and Area B taken after the survey and shovel testing, and a heavy rain. It contained 2
pieces of glass, 2 whiteware ceramic sherds, and 26 prehistoric flakes and flake fragments
Historic items make up of33 per cent of the collection and 67 percent is prehistoric.
Historic items are household related and are ceramic dinnerware (plain white and transfer
ware), a figurine fragment, window glass, bottle glass, and decorative depression ware glass.
Metal items make up the remainder of the collection and are a link of chain, machine cut square
nails, a handmade square nail, and unidentifiable metal fragments. Prehistoric materials show that
raw material was reduced on site. The collection reveals that the locale is a knapping station
where all levels of flint knapping took place.
In addition to reduction material, evidence of tool making and tool use was also found.
Blade flakes, a core-scraper, and a projectile point basal ftagment were also found. The projectile
point base appears to be a Plainview paleo point (Figure 4). Raw material is made up of natural
occurring cobbles from Onion Creek. Most rock is dark yellowish brown (10YR4/2) or grayish
brown (lOYR3/2), followed by a range of pale yellowish brown (lOYR6/4), grayish brown
(l0YR5/2), grayish brown (5YR5/2), dark grayish black (N2), light gray (N8). The surficial
deposits are disturbed by erosion and some items have been burned during historic and modem
periods.
Shovel Test Recovery (n=175)
Four shovel tests were dug in the artifact concentration which is designated Area B of
Site 41HY433. All of the tests were positive and 165 items were recovered (Table 1). Levell (0­
10 em) contained 81 items; Level 2 (10-20 em) contained 38 items, and Level 3 (20-30 cm)
contained 42 items. Of the recovered items, 21 or ca. 12 percent are historic and 145 or 84
percent are prehistoric artifacts, and 8 or about 5 percent are faunal specimens. The moderate to
dense concentration of mixed historic and prehistoric artifacts is 0-30 em deep.
A total of 49 specimens were recovered from Shovel Tests 19, 20, and 21 (1/4-inch
recovery); 116 specimens were recovered from ST 22 (1/6 -inch recovery). Water screening and
use of 1/16-inch mesh increased recovery by 70+ percent. Historic recovery includes a square nail
(n=I), a fence staple (n=I), clear and brown glass fragments (n::;=l1),miscellaneous oxidized
metal fragments (n=7), and white ware ceramics (n=I). Prehistoric materials recovered are 71
flakes, fragments, and shatter greater than I em in size and 74 microflakes less than .5 em in size.
Faunal material recovered includes bird bone fragments (n=2) and unidentifted bone (n=6).

Artifact Analysis
A total of 260 items were recovered from the surface (n=95) and shovel tests (n= 165) in
Area B. The artifacts are mixed historic and prehistoric. Historic items number 51 and make up
20 percent of the sample collected. Prehistoric items number 204 and make up ca 78 percent of
the items collected. Five fuanal specimens make up ca.2 percent of the collection. Of the 260
items, a sample of 153 pieces of lithic debitage or 73 percent of prehistoric specimens were
selected for limited analysis. Artifact attributes were examined in order to determine the level and
types of lithic activity practiced at the knapping station. Flake type, maximum length, and wear
pattern characteristics were measured and/or tallied.
The sample analyzed contains 42 whole flakes; 67 proximal, 12 medial, 9 distal flake
fragments; and 23 pieces of shatter. Of the 42 flakes, 9 are primary, 12 are secondary, and 21 are
tertiary level with all cortex removed. Of the 42 whole flakes, 21 are very small (.5-2 cm), 25
small (2.1-4 cm), 9 are medium (4.1-6cm), and 6 are large (6.1-8cm) in size. Small and very
small tertiary flakes are representative of tool making and re-sharpening. Wear patterns resulting
from use are present on 26 of the 42 whole flakes or 62 percent and are visible on 28 of the 66
broken flakes or 42 percent. Wear patterns indicate that the majority of pieces of lithic debitage
were used as expedient tools to cut and scrape.
The historic collection was not analyzed, but is characteristic of typical household items
from the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth century. The prehistoric lithic collection is
representative of bifacial thinning, sharpening, and re-sharpening related to tool and dart point
manufacture. Most artifacts are small, broken, and have been subject to disturbance. The bone is
well preserved; some could be deer bone.
CONCLUSIONS
Site 41HY433, Area B, contains significant prehistoric archeological deposits that
contain a Plainview Paleo point fragment ca. 8,000 - 10,000 years old and Archaic period bifaces
6500-8000 years old. The tools are associated with a discrete knapping station of uncertain age.
Artifacts analyzed reflect the entire sequence of lithic reduction, tool manufacture, tool
sharpening, and use from multiple time periods. Although the context of the deposits is mixed
historic and prehistoric, the contents of the deposits have the ability to provide new data about are
chronology and lithic technology. For these reasons, the archeological deposits in Area B are
judged to be contributing factors to the sites' National Register and State Archeological
Landmark eligibility status. Impacts to the deposits should be avoided. If avoidance is not
possible additional archeological work is necessary to mitigate impacts.
RECOMMENDATIONS
It is recommended that archeological deposits in Area B be avoided and protected and
preserved in place. The locale should be treated by sealing it with clean fill at least 4-6 inches
deep, as soon as possible. The playscape should be constructed above-the-ground. If the
playscape cannot be placed on a pad, it is recommended to eliminate it from Area B and/or move
it outside Tract 1. Do not dig in Area B and minimize surface disturbance when removing silt
fencing and laying sod or spreading fill. While uncovered and bare of vegetation, park personnel
should periodically monitor the locale for artifact exposure, erosion impacts, and metal detecting,
surface collection, and/or digging activity by the public or subcontractors. In closing, as a result
of the significant discovery in Area A, a new recommendation is formulated for Tract 2
Development. City Parks and Recreation Director Danny Zincke, who is knowledgeable about
prehistoric deposits, should monitor excavation of the proposed pond in Tract 2. Any buried
artifacts and cultural horizons discovered during pond excavation should be reported to the Texas
Historical Commission and evaluated for significance.

RECEIVED

TEXASHISTORICALGOMMISSION

Dear ~s,
The purpose of this letter is twofold. The first is to clarify the location of the proposed entry way for
the City of Buda Stagecoach Park. The second is to report findings of a site visit made December 10, 2007,
by a representative from Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC). The proposed entry way is located about
60 feet east of the existing private driveway used to access the property (Figure 1). The visit revealed that a
small portion of Site 41HY433 has been impacted by blading.
The proposed public park entry was moved to the east to avoid the private drive and so that the entry
road could be widened. In addition, the move was made for safety purposes to prevent the large oak tree east
of the private drive from obscuring line of sight. The proposed entry runs northwest across the southwest
portion of Tract 1, also the southwest portion Site 41HY433. The visit by APC revealed that blading for the
entry has been performed prior to any archeological shovel testing. Topsoil has been removed to a depth of
ca.34 inches to expose caliche road base and decomposed/weathered caliche soil and placed in backdirt piles
(Figure 2). The blading showed the absence of any soil development and/or feature remnants of the stage coach
road bed.
A part of Feature 3, the nineteenth century stage coach road, that has been previously disturbed was
affected by blading for the entry (Figure 3). This portion of the Feature 3 has been previously impacted by the
installation of subterranean telephone, water and sewer lines, an overhead power line, and drainage
improvement for Loop 4 (Figure 4). Due to the disturbance this portion of the feature, it is not a contributing
factor to the site's significance. Lastly, a portion of the circular twentieth century driveway identified in APC
Shovel Test 2 and believed to be associated with the Whitaker (1937-1958) and Franke (1959~1971)
occupations has also been impacted. This modem historic feature consists of caliche roadbase ca.3 inches thick
and does not contribute to the significance of the site 41HY433.
The results of the site visit were negative; no evidence of nineteenth or twentieth century subterranean
features were observed in the bladed area which has been previously disturbed. No artifucts were observed in
backdirt pushed up during blading. The significance contributing components of the historic features in Tract
1, were avoided and were protected. Therefore, APC recommends that construction of the entry way proceed
with no further work.
