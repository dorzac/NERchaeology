ABSTRACT
This multivolume report contains the substantive findings and management
recommendations of two cultural resource inventories conducted by Integrated
Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for the Speegleville Road Improvements
Project and Surrey Ridge Lane Widening Project located in McLennan County,
Texas. The proposed projects required coordination with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) prior to construction, per the provisions of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). In addition, as each project will require a Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act (CWA) Nationwide Permit (NWP) 14 from the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE), portions of each project under USACE jurisdiction
will be subject to the provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended
The results of the two projects, conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit #7969,
were documented within two draft interim reports. Each interim report has been
included as a separate volume within this report. The individual interim reports
contained within this document received formal review from the Texas Historical
Commission (THC). The THC comments issued for each interim report are
included in Volume III. Records collected for each report will be curated
temporarily at IES and permanently curated at Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL).
The goal of the surveys was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources,
which include standing structures and archeological sites that could be adversely
affected by proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for their
potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). All work
conformed to 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the
regulations for implementing the ACT.
During the intensive archeological survey, IES investigators encountered two
newly recorded historic-period sites (see following page for listing of all sites).
Through subsequent analysis, all sites recorded were determined to be not eligible
within the APE for listing on the NRHP or as a SAL. No further work warranted.

ABSTRACT
This interim report documents the substantive findings and management
recommendations of a cultural resources inventory conducted by Integrated
Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for the Speegleville Road Improvements Project in
McLennan County, Texas. As McLennan County is a political entity of the State of
Texas, the proposed project will require coordination with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) prior to construction, per the provisions of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). In addition, as the project will require a Section 404 of the Clean Water
Act (CWA) Nationwide Permit (NWP) 14 from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE), portions of the project under the USACE jurisdiction will be subject to the
provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
All work conformed to 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800, and 13 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the regulations for implementing Section
106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively. The goal of the survey was to locate,
identify, and assess any cultural resources, which include standing buildings/structures
and archeological sites that could be adversely affected by the proposed development,
and to evaluate such resources for their potential eligibility for listing as a State
Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources inventory was conducted by archeologists Thomas Chapman and
Anne Gibson on 09 and 10 May 2017, under Antiquities Permit No. 7969. The proposed
project will span the 4.02-mile segment of Speegleville Road between the Middle Bosque
River and State Highway (SH) 6. Although overall designs for the project are still in the
early stages of development, the County is currently planning to completely reconstruct
the existing two-lane Speegleville Road between the Middle Bosque River and Marie
Drive. North of Marie Drive, Speegleville Road will be rerouted to include a minimally
cured arc connection to SH 6. Current plans for the new alignment section call for
construction of a two-lane road with shoulder and drainage ditch within a 120-foot Rightof-Way (ROW). The ROW spans 100 feet in existing sections of closed road. The Area
of Potential Effects will encompass approximately 48.92 acres.
Although two historic-period sites (41ML318 and 41ML319) were documented during
the field survey, based on each site’s lack of association with a significant historical
event(s) or person(s) and low potential to yield significant archeological data, the portion
of each within the APE should be considered not eligible for listing in the NRHP under
Criteria A, B, or D as enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4, nor considered for SAL designation.
No further work is warranted. However, if any cultural resources, other than those
documented within this report, are encountered during construction, the operators should
stop construction activities and immediately contact the project environmental
representative to initiate coordination with the THC prior to resuming any construction
activities.
This interim report serves as partial fulfillment of the requirements of the Antiquities
Permit No. 7969. The results of these investigations will be compiled into a single report
containing all projects completed under Antiquities Permit No. 7969. All project related
documents and photographs will be curated with the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report was written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project corridor or Area of
Potential Effect (APE), environmental setting, and methodology; followed by the results of the
investigations and recommendations. This report serves as the cultural resources report to satisfy the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106
requirements.

1.1 Introduction
As the project cultural resources consultant for Walker Partners, McLennan County, and the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE), Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) performed an intensive
cultural resources inventory for an approximate 48.92-acre road located along Speegleville Road between
State Highway (SH) 6 and the Middle Bosque River, McLennan County, Texas. The APE is plotted on
recent aerial photography and the Speegleville and South Bosque 7.5-minute series U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) Quadrangle sheets (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
During the desktop analysis and background review, conducted prior to the pedestrian survey, it was
determined that the natural landscape had been exposed to a variety of activities that have drastically
affected the soil’s stratigraphic integrity prior to the current project. Although the natural setting within
the vast majority of the project area may have been altered, an investigation was conducted to identify any
archeological sites, buildings, structures, or other resources located within the project area that may be
eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or listing as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL).

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
1.2.1 Direct APE
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) will encompass approximately 48.92 acres. The proposed project
will span the 4.02-mile segment of Speegleville Road between the Middle Bosque River and SH 6.
Although overall design plans for the project are still in the early stages of development, the County is
currently planning to completely reconstruct the existing two-lane Speegleville Road between the Middle
Bosque River and Marie Drive. North of Marie Drive, Speegleville Road will be rerouted to include a
minimally curved arc connection to SH 6. Current plans for the new alignment section call for
construction of a two-lane road with shoulder and drainage ditch within a 120-foot-wide Right-of-Way
(ROW). The ROW spans 100 feet in existing sections of closed road.
1.2.2 Indirect APE
As the project will require federal permitting from the USACE, an assessment of the indirect effects will
be required within USACE jurisdiction to satisfy Section 106 of the NHPA requirements. Although exact
designs are not currently available, surface elements of the project will be typical for multi-lane
roadways. To account for these potential above-ground design elements, a 100-foot wide indirect effects
APE will be considered surrounding the direct effects APE within USACE jurisdictional areas.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
2.1.1 Climate
McLennan County is in the north-central part of the State of Texas. This region has a humid subtropical
climate and an annual rainfall averaging between approximately 35 and 40 inches. About half of the rain
usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year. The
humid, temperate climate tends to have long summers and short winters with occasional cold snaps
(Estaville and Earl 2008; Miller et al. 2001).
2.1.2 Topographic Setting
The USGS Speegleville 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map illustrates the APE as located across an
upland terrace dissected by several streams. The headwaters to Davis Branch form approximately 0.22mile northwest of the of the APE, flows to the southeast, and cross the APE north of the original
Speegleville Road. Hog Creek bisects the central portion of the APE north of County Road 451-B. An
unnamed tributary of Middle Bosque River form approximately 0.8-mile northwest of the APE, flows to
the southeast, and crosses the APE between Farm to Market (FM) 3047 and Windsor Way. The southern
terminus of the APE is located immediately north of the Middle Bosque River (see Figure 1.2).
2.1.3 Geology and Soils
The APE is located within the Limestone Cut Plain section of the Cross Timbers ecoregion, which is
characterized by low-relief topography, lower drainage density, and more open woodland components
(Griffith et al. 2007; Miller and Greenwade 1981). Soils within the APE are underlain by the Cretaceousage Main Street Limestone (Kms) and Grayson Marl formations, characterized by alternating beds of
limestone and marl with some sand near the upper portion of the formation (Proctor et al. 1979).
Quaternary-age alluvial deposits are also present adjacent to major waterways (Figure 2.1).
As shown by the Soil Survey of McLennan County, Texas, there are nine mapped soil units within the
APE (Miller and Greenwade 1981; Table 2.1). The entire APE contains soils typical of the Limestone
Cut Plain, with clay and silty clay mantling flood plain and terrace landforms and thin silty clay and
gravelly clay loam on interfluvial ridges. Soil data was viewed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Figure 2.2; Web Soil
Survey 2017).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
A records review within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) maintained by the THC identified
that there are no National Register properties, historical markers, cemeteries, or previously recorded
archeological sites located within the APE. Based on TASA records, three previous archeological
surveys have been conducted within 1 mile of the proposed project APE (Table 3.1; Figure 3.1). In
1975, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) sponsored a survey that loosely follows New
Windsor Parkway and encroaches into the southern third of the APE. In 1983, the Rural Electrification
Administration (REA; now the Rural Utilities Service branch of the USDA) sponsored a survey for an
electric transmission line that extends west of Speegleville Road in the southern third of the APE. One of
several archeological surveys related to Waco Lake, located approximately 1 to 2 miles west of the
proposed APE, was conducted in 1985 on behalf of the USACE Fort Worth District. As a result of these
surveys, three previously recorded archeological sites are located within 1 mile of the APE (Table 3.2).
Site 41ML116 is located approximately 150 feet west of the APE south of Chisolm Drive. This site is a
large moderately dense prehistoric lithic scatter containing flakes and other lithic debris extending to
approximately 30 centimeters below surface (cmbs) with a minor historic-period component reflected by
a minimal amount of comingled domestic artifacts. Site 41ML117 is a large prehistoric lithic scatter
located approximately 0.85 mile west of the APE on a terrace within a meander of the Middle Bosque
River. Site 4ML131, located approximately 1 mile east of the proposed APE along Hog Creek, is a
deeply-buried prehistoric habitation site comprised of several observed thermal features eroding from the
banks of the creek channel and gullies and in an area disturbed by the use of excavation machinery.

3.2 Regional Historical Background
The Central Texas region, including McLennan County, has supported human habitation for thousands of
years. Archeological evidence suggests that hunters and gatherers, some of whom may have been the
ancestors of the Tonkawa people, lived in the area as early as 11,000 years ago (Smyrl 2016). The City of
Waco is located on the site of an agricultural village once inhabited by the Native American Waco tribe
(Conger 2010; Sawyer 2016). The Wacos were a band of the Wichita Tribe that came to Central Texas in
the 1700s. The village in Waco served as the permanent settlement during planting and harvesting
seasons, consisting of beehive-shaped dwellings made of grasses and willow. Crops farmed by the Wacos
included corn, melons, squash, and beans. During the fall and winter, the Wacos traveled the plains to
hunt deer and buffalo (Sawyer 2016).
The first written encounter between the Wacos and Europeans was in 1772 by Spanish settlers. During
the early 19th century, settlers of European descent began to arrive in the area, leading to tension and
hostility between both groups until a peace treaty in 1824. By 1830, old Waco Village ceased to exist as
the Wacos had either been driven out by a band of Cherokee or fell victim to a smallpox epidemic
(Conger 2010; Sawyer 2016). The remaining members of the Waco tribe in the county were eventually
forced out and, through a series of treaties, relocated with the Wichita Tribe to a reservation in Oklahoma.
In 1825, the area of McLennan County was part of the colonization grant obtained from the Mexican
government and later part of Robertson’s Colony. After the desertion of Waco Village and treaties with
the Waco and Wichita groups, settlers began to move into the area. Fort Fisher, established in 1837,
became the first Anglo-American settlement. In the 1840s, a land grant including the original old Waco
Village was sold, divided into blocks and lots, and sold at dollars apiece, leading to the creation of Waco
Village, which was later incorporated as the Town of Waco. McLennan County, named after Neil
McLennan, was established in 1850 with Waco selected as the county seat. Much of the county’s early
economy was based on agriculture, especially cotton. The local economy declined during the Civil War
as draining of man power for the Confederate army left few workers in the area (Conger 2010; Smryl
2016).
The economy began to boom again in the county after 1870. Production of cotton, wheat, and corn, as
well as the raising of cattle, hogs, and sheep fueled much of the economy. In 1870, the Waco Bridge
Company opened the Waco Suspension Bridge spanning the Brazos River. The bridge not only
connected Waco and East Waco, but also provided a safe, direct route to travel across the river. In 1871,
Waco and Northwestern Railroad was built, making McLennan County a significant point for settlers
heading farther west and a center for shipping in the area (Conger 2010). As a result of increased traffic
through the county, saloons, gaming houses, and a legal red light district were opened, attracting
cattlemen from the Chisolm Trail, drifters, and others to Waco (Conger 2010). In the 1880s, the St. Louis
and Southwestern Railroad and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad were built in the region, making
Waco a significant transportation center between regional farms, factories, and consumers throughout the
nation (Smyrl 2010).
The population of McLennan County steadily rose as the economy prospered, although the population
balance shifted from mostly rural areas to urban settings. The opening of Camp MacArthur and Rich
Field during World War I significantly increased the population of McLennan County. Although
agriculture continued to dominate, industry began to grow within the county. Several large manufacturers
moved into the county including the Barton Dyanshine factory, the Borden Company, and the Atlas
Portland Cement Company. The county’s growth slowed during the Great Depression and a severe
drought (Smyrl 2010).

The start of World War II aided McLennan County’s industrial growth. The Bluebonnet ordnance plant
and the Waco Army Airfield was established in addition to several new industrial companies. Stimulated
by these new developments, McLennan County shifted from an agricultural focus to an industrial focus.
Agriculture changed from small family farms to larger commercial establishments and incorporated more
diverse crops (Smyrl 2010).
Following World War II, McLennan County experienced a resurgence of population growth. In 1953, the
county, and especially Waco, experienced a serious setback in May, when a tornado struck the downtown
area. Several city blocks were destroyed leaving 144 people dead and 1,097 injured. Another setback
occurred in the 1960s when Connally Air Force Base closed, leaving a large quantity of workers
unemployed, and the decline of the railroad led to economic pressures in several of the small towns
surrounding Waco. To combat this series of setbacks, several urban renewal projects were initiated that
included the construction of Interstate Highway 35, the establishment of McLennan Community College,
the expansion of Lake Waco, and the establishment of the Texas State Technical College in Waco. A
new interest in local history prompted the reconstruction of Fort Fisher as the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame
and Museum and the renovation of the suspension bridge (Smyrl 2010).
In more recent years, approximately 76 percent of McLennan County was used for the cultivation of
crops with a focus on cotton, corn, oats, and wheat. For the most part, industry surpassed agriculture in
terms of numbers of employees and income. Poultry processing, manufacture of prepared feeds, and
dairy production were among the county’s important businesses (Smyrl 2010).

3.3 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
McLennan County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas – Waco Sheet, USGS topographic maps, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) digital soil database
for McLennan County, the Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) Waco District, the National Archives and Records Administration’s (NARA)
1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for McLennan County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO)
georeferenced maps, and both past and current aerial photography.
3.3.1 Prehistoric Resource Potential
According to the PALM for the Waco District, the majority of the APE contained a low to moderate
potential for containing shallow and deeply buried cultural materials within a reasonable context. Two
portions of the APE featured a high potential for containing cultural materials. These areas included a
central 1,250-foot-long portion of the APE adjacent to Hog Creek and within approximately 900 feet of
Middle Bosque River. Portions of the APE within close proximity to the unnamed tributary of Middle
Bosque River featured a moderate potential for containing cultural materials.
During background review, it was determined that ground-disturbing activities related to past land use
and transportation development have transpired within the APE. Historical aerial photography indicated
the majority of the APE was used for agricultural, pastoral, and transportation purposed as early as 1952.
During that time, the majority of the APE traversed agricultural fields. The APE in proximity to Hog
Creek and Middle Bosque River was uncultivated. Between 1955 and 1964, Speegleville Road was
constructed south of Marie Drive. Modern aerial photography illustrated the southern three-quarters of
the APE as occupying Speegleville Road. Due to the degree of disturbance, it was concluded that the
APE does not retain reasonable contextual integrity. As such, the APE featured a low potential for
encountering prehistoric cultural materials.

3.3.2 Historic-Period Resource Potential
Historical-period resources within North-Central Texas are primarily related to farmsteads, houses, and
associated outbuildings and structures that date from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Typically,
these types of resources are located along old roadways, but can be located along railroads, creeks, and
open pastures. Although determining the presence of the earliest of these buildings and structures was
problematic, thorough and accurate maps depicting these features were widely available post-1915.
The 1905 USDA soils map for the Waco area illustrated the APE as being void of historic-period
structures. Aerial photography between 1952 and 1970 depicted a series of storage structures located
approximately 0.56 mile southwest of the intersection of Speegleville Road and SH 6. By 1995, these
structures were largely removed, and the area was developed. Modern aerial photography depicted
rectangular foundations of the southwestern most of these storage structures. An additional outbuilding
associated with a dwelling was located within the APE south of McLennan Crossing Road. It was
demolished during the construction of Speegleville Road prior to 1964. As the APE occurs partially
within the boundary of Speegleville Road and an undeveloped agricultural field, the APE is considered to
have a low potential for containing historic-period resources.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory and architectural survey for the Speegleville Road Improvements Project was
conducted on 09 and 10 May 2017. The methods and shovel test interval met the minimum requirements
for field methods stipulated by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for Texas. Prior to
field work, the IES staff conducted an historical and archeological records search to determine what
cultural resources have been recorded within the APE and within a 1-mile radius of the APE. This
information was detailed in Chapter 3. Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, and soils
data, as well as, historic and recent topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Survey Methods
The 100-percent intensive pedestrian survey consisted of careful examination of the ground surface and
existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. The survey consisted
of multiple transects within the ROW extending the entire length of the APE. Areas within the existing
ROW and roadway that displayed high levels of disturbance were photographed to document the lack of
potential for intact archeological deposits. Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps,
and shovel test records.

4.2 Shovel Testing
In areas with the potential to preserve buried archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to a
depth of 80 centimeters (cm) or the bottom of culturally sterile deposits, whichever was encountered first.
Each shovel test was 30 cm in diameter and was hand excavated in natural stratigraphic levels not
exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using ¼-inch hardware cloth to facilitate the
recovery of buried cultural materials. All tests were recorded on maps and plotted using hand-held
Global Positioning System (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of each test on standardized
shovel test forms. According to the Archeological Survey Standards of Texas, for linear projects
displaying little to no disturbance, 16 shovel tests should be excavated per mile per transect. However,
shovel test numbers varied based on the amount of disturbance, exposed bedrock or culturally sterile soil,
ground visibility, and steep slope present within the APE, or if archeological site(s) were encountered.
During the pedestrian survey, 66 shovel tests were excavated within the 48.92-acre APE. All positive
shovel tests, cultural features, and other site data was geospatially recorded using Trimble Geo XT handheld GPS unit.

4.3 Site Recording
When applicable, archeological sites were evaluated through no fewer than six shovel tests to document
their horizontal extent and assess the depth of archeological deposits. Negative shovel tests, the
distribution of surficial artifacts/features, topography, and/or the APE extent delineated the boundary of
each site. For the purposes of this survey, an archeological site was defined as five or more surface
artifacts within a 10-m radius, a cultural feature observed on the surface or exposed during shovel testing,
a positive shovel test containing two or more subsurface artifacts, or two or more positive shovel tests
located within 30 m of each other. All newly-documented sites were assigned a temporary field number
and were recorded on State of Texas Archeological Site Data forms, photographed, sketch mapped, and
plotted on the USGS topographic quadrangle.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this
reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in feet or miles within this
report, archeological measurements and observations are expressed in metric, unless it is more relevant to
present artifact diagnostic elements in imperial unit measurements (e.g., historic-age artifacts or features).

IES Project No. 04.142.013
Page 21

4.4 Site Assessment
A scaled map was prepared for each identified archeological site, and each site was plotted on the
Speegleville and South Bosque 7.5-minute USGS topographic maps. The data from any encountered site
was recorded in the field and processed at the IES office in McKinney, Texas to determine site
significance and potential eligibility as a SAL or listing on the NRHP. When applicable, a variety of data
was used to assess site significance including date(s), artifact density, artifact variety, features density,
feature variety, feature preservation, stratigraphic integrity, and amount of disturbance. Completed site
forms were submitted to the TARL.

4.5 National Register Evaluation Criteria
When evaluated within its historic context, a cultural resource property must be shown to be significant
for one or more of the four criteria for evaluation (A, B, C, or D) (36 CFR 60.4 [a-d]). These criteria
pertain to cultural resource properties, which include districts, sites, buildings, structures, objects:
A) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
B) that are association with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history.

4.6 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation are included in the curation package. All field-generated documents are temporarily
curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and photographs were
organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During pedestrian survey, two archeological sites were encountered within the 48.92-acre APE. Shovel
test unit locations are illustrated in Figures 5.1 and 5.2. A photograph location map and project
photographs are located in Appendix A. Archeological site maps are illustrated in Figures 5.3 and 5.4.
Archeological site locations are in Appendix B.

5.1 Archeological Survey
5.1.1 Past Ground Disturbances
During background review, it was determined that ground-disturbing activities related to past land use
and transportation development have transpired within the APE. Historical aerial photography indicated
the majority of the APE was used for agricultural, pastoral, and transportation purposes as early as 1952.
During that time, the majority of the APE was located within active agricultural fields. The APE in
proximity to Hog Creek and Middle Bosque River was uncultivated. Between 1955 and 1964,
Speegleville Road was constructed south of Marie Drive. Modern aerial photography illustrated the
southern three-quarters of the APE as encompassing the original Speegleville Road.
5.1.2 Survey Observations
Field investigations verified the disturbances depicted in historical aerial photographs and documented
that the majority of the APE had been exposed to some form of ground disturbances that would have
affected shallowly buried archeological deposits (Appendix A, Photographs 01 through 23). Identified
disturbances included transportation development and associated infrastructure and agricultural land use.
5.1.3 Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
During the IES survey, 66 negative shovel tests were excavated throughout the APE (see Figures 5.1 and
5.2). Most of the APE accommodated two transects situated on the opposing margins of the existing
ROW or within the proposed new ROW. Survey of the portion of the APE between Marie Drive and
Speegleville Road utilized a single pedestrian transect. Shovel tests were spaced at approximately 100-m
intervals along each transect where applicable. Due to observed disturbances and plowed fields with 100
percent visibility, small portions of the APE required less-intensive shovel testing. As such, small
portions of the APE were only photographed and visually inspected for cultural materials on the surface.
Field survey verified the disturbed nature of much of the APE.
Shovel testing within the APE revealed a predominant soil type consisting of a very dark gray clay (10YR
3/1) or brown clay loam (10YR 3/2) containing small gravel and larger rocks within the existing ROW.
These shovel tests rarely exceeded 40 cm in depth due to extremely compact soils. Soils within the new
ROW in agricultural fields revealed a dark gray loam (10YR 4/1) that featured no gravel. These shovel
tests ranged between 40 to 60 cm in depth. In addition to shovel testing, subsurface exposures including
animal burrows, disturbed areas, and the cut banks of streams were examined.

5.2 Encountered Archeological Resources
5.2.1 41ML318
During the IES survey, a newly recorded historic-period site (41ML318) was encountered within the
northern 0.3 mile of the APE southwest of the intersection of Speegleville Road and Texas Loop 340 (see
Figure 5.3). Topographically, the site was situated in a generally level upland terrain setting. Through
the comparisons of the site’s location and historical aerial photography and maps, it was determined that
41ML318 pertained to the remnants of a farm established between 1902 and 1952. The site measured
approximately 30 m by 30 m, and was defined by a surface feature and an ephemeral accumulation of
surface and subsurface artifacts.

Page 27

A complete delineation of the site boundary was not possible due to the limitations of the APE. Based on
a review of historical aerial photographs, the site likely extends outside the APE to the northwest.
5.2.1.1 Past Ground Disturbances
Aerial photographs from 1952 illustrate the site was a component of a well-organized farm with
approximately 16 large-scale animal pens and associated outbuildings. Aerial photographs show that the
site was expanded to include seven additional animal pens to the north and west of the previous
structures. Between 1970 and 1982, the farm was largely cleared and the land within and surrounding the
site was left undeveloped.
5.2.1.2 Survey Observation and Shovel Testing
Through the excavation of 10 shovel tests, it was determined that the artifacts associated with the site
consisted of scrap metal concentrated near surface features. A low-density artifact scatter was
encountered within one positive shovel test and was observed in extremely low density within Feature 1.
Artifacts observed during the site delineation consisted of scrap metal, galvanized steel pipes, and bottle
glass. However, the majority of the artifacts observed consisted of modern debris (Attachment A,
Photographs 24 through 26).
A variable accumulation of artifacts was observed across the ground surface within the site, which was
characterized by oxidized scrap metal, corrugated scrap metal, colored bottle glass, clear flat glass,
modern ceramic sherds, and modern plastic debris. Shovel testing was conducted across the site to
determine the type of artifacts buried and the level of subsurface integrity. Although shovel testing was a
component of defining the site boundary, the site boundary was defined primarily through surface
features and historical aerial photographic interpretations. Shovel testing within and surrounding the site
revealed a soil profile consisting of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay loam soils overlaid by dark
brown (10YR 3/3) clay soils. Termination of shovel tests within 41ML318 ranged from 30 to 40 cmbs
with disturbed soils and heavily compact clay as reasons for termination. Through the excavation of 10
negative shovel test excavations in proximity to Feature 1 and the distribution of surficial scatter, it was
determined that the vertical extent of the site was restricted the surface.
5.2.1.3 Archeological Features
Feature 1 was an approximate 40-foot by 23-foot concrete foundation located near the westernmost
large-scale structure observed in historical aerial photography from 1964. Feature 1 is a small portion of
a larger foundation feature that terminates approximately 100 feet northwest beyond the boundary of the
APE (Attachment A, Photograph 27). It is comprised of a 6-inch concrete curb-like raised foundation
that ranged in height from 2 to 6 inches above the modern ground surface.
5.2.1.4 Archival Research
41ML318 was located within the F. Dean survey (Abstract No. 298), which was patented on the 17 April
1847 and comprised 320 acres. Using public deed records from the McLennan County Clerk’s Office, a
chain-of-title for the property encompassing the historic-period farmstead was generated (Table 5.1).
According to the deed card, the farmstead originated in 1902, when the land was deeded to the Burnham
Land-Livestock and Farming Company. Based on these records and historical aerial photographs, the
historic-period site most likely pertains to the Youngblood and Chapin family ownerships. None of the
names associated with these families were listed in the Handbook of Texas or on TXGenWeb.org
website.

5.2.1.5 Site Summary
Site 41ML318 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained the remnants of a farm that
originated sometime prior to 1952 and was in use until between 1970 and 1982 when the property was
transferred and domestic dwellings were erected. Shovel testing within the site encountered minimal
household debris from the 20th century. Most of the shovel tests were negative for cultural materials,
while one positive shovel test unearthed shallow artifacts. No subsurface features were encountered
within the site. While one surface feature was documented during the site delineation, IES archeologists
observed additional features northwest of the APE.
5.2.2 41ML319
During the IES survey, a newly recorded historic-period site (41ML319) was encountered along the
southern APE boundary along the Middle Bosque River (see Figure 5.4). Topographically, the site was
situated on the mid-slope separating the Middle Bosque River terrace and an upland terrace. Through the
comparisons of the site’s location and historical aerial photography and maps, it was determined
41ML319 pertained to an erosion scar that has accumulated historical and modern debris. The site
measured approximately 7 m by 20 m and was defined by an accumulation of historic-period artifacts
within an erosion scar. A full delineation of the site boundary was unobtainable due to the APE
limitations. Based on historical aerial photographs, the site extends outside the APE to the south.
5.2.2.1 Part Ground Disturbances
Aerial photographs from 1952 depict a road on the upper terrace that parallels the Middle Bosque River.
This road existed near the northern boundary of the site. By 1970, use of the road waned and the banks of
the Middle Bosque River became overgrown. The erosion scar was clearly visible on aerial photography
from the 1970s. Since that time, the land within and surrounding the site was left undeveloped and
avoided significant artificial disturbances.
5.2.2.2 Survey Observation and Shovel Testing
During site delineation, IES investigators excavated four negative shovel tests. Ground visibility during
the survey was approximately 5 percent. Investigators observed a low density surficial scatter of clear

glass, colored bottle glass, scrap metal, unmarked bricks, and tabular concrete blocks. Overall,
approximately 10 to 25 artifacts were observed. All artifacts were observed within an erosional setting
within little to no contextual integrity. Through the site delineation, it was determined that the southern
half of the site was located on moderately-sloped terrain approaching the Middle Bosque River and would
not be shovel tested. Shovel testing revealed a layer of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) clay soils
that featured common limestone gravel inclusions. Shovel testing was terminated at a depth of
approximately 40 cmbs due to the extremely compact clay soil. Shovel testing recovered no cultural
materials.
5.2.2.3 Archeological Features
Feature 1 was an approximate 10-foot by 36-foot erosional feature that contained large (<15 cm in
diameter) limestone cobbles and tabular cement blocks (Appendix A, Photographs 28 through 33).
Within the erosional feature, investigators observed modern debris, scrap metal, and tabular concrete
blocks.
5.2.2.4 Archival Research
41ML319 was located within the Thomas H. Barron survey (Abstract No. 126), which was patented on
the 19 September 1845 and comprised 1,280 acres. Using public deed records from the McLennan
County Clerk’s Office, a chain of title for the property encompassing the historic-period farmstead was
generated (Table 5.2). According to deed records, the property on which the site is located was
purchased by the Rolf family in 1966. None of the names associated with these families were listed in the
Handbook of Texas or on TXGenWeb.org website.

5.2.2.5 Site Summary
Site 41ML319 was a newly recorded historic-period site that contained the accumulation of historic-aged
artifacts and modern debris within an erosion scar along an upland terrace of the Middle Bosque River.
Shovel testing within the site recovered no cultural materials. No subsurface features were encountered
within the site.
5.2.3 Indirect APE Assessment
To satisfy NHPA requirements, visual impacts were assessed. Historical maps and modern aerial
photographs indicated the indirect APE was void of historic-period resources. The indirect effects
assessment verified the current land use identified through background review. Most of the indirect APE
occupied open land, water features, and the banks of the water features. A small portion of the indirect
APE encroached into a residential development constructed between 2005 and 2008.

41ML318, 41ML319

41ML318 is a newly-recorded historic-period archeological site containing the remnants of a farm that
originated sometime prior to 1952. It was in use until between 1970 and 1982 when the property
transferred ownership and domestic dwellings were erected. Shovel testing within the site
encountered minimal household debris from the 20th century. No subsurface features were
encountered within the site. Based on the lack of association with a significant historical event(s) or
person(s) and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the portion of site 41ML318
within the APE should be considered not eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D
nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is recommended at this location.
41ML319 is a newly-recorded archeological site that contained an accumulation of historic-period
artifacts and modern debris within an erosion scar along an upland terrace of the Middle Bosque
River. Shovel testing within the site recovered no cultural materials. No subsurface features were
encountered within the site. Based on the site lack of association with a significant historical event(s)
or person(s) and the low potential to yield significant archeological data, the portion of site 41ML319
within the APE should be considered not eligible for listing in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or D as
enumerated in 36 CFR 60.4, nor considered for SAL designation. No further work is recommended
at this location.
It is the recommendation of IES that the Speegleville Road Improvements Project be permitted to
continue without the need for further cultural resource investigations. However, if any cultural resources,
other than those detailed within this report, are encountered during construction, the operators should stop
construction activities immediately in those areas. The project environmental consultant should then be
contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC/SHPO prior to resuming construction activities.
This interim report serves as partial fulfillment of the requirements of the Antiquities Permit No. 7969.
The results of these investigations will be compiled into a single report containing all projects completed
under Antiquities Permit No. 7969.

ABSTRACT
This interim report documents the substantive findings and management
recommendations of a cultural resource inventory conducted by Integrated
Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) for the Surrey Ridge Lane Widening Project in
McLennan County, Texas. As McLennan County is a political entity of the State of
Texas, the proposed project will require coordination with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) prior to construction, per the provisions of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). In addition, as the project will require a Section 404 of the Clean Water
Act (CWA) Nationwide Permit (NWP) 14 from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE), portions of the project under the USACE jurisdiction will be subject to the
provisions of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended.
All work conformed to 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 800, and 13 Texas
Administrative Code (TAC) 26, which outline the regulations for implementing Section
106 of the NHPA and the ACT, respectively. The goal of the survey was to locate,
identify, and assess any cultural resources, which include standing buildings/structures
and archeological sites that could be adversely affected by the proposed development,
and to evaluate such resources for their potential eligibility for listing as a State
Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources inventory was conducted by archeologists Thomas Chapman and
Anne Gibson on 08 May 2017, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7969. The proposed
project will span the 1.36-mile stretch of Surrey Ridge Lane between IH 35 and FM 3148
and encompass approximately 12.47 acres. During the IES survey, no cultural resources
were documented within the Area of Potential Effects. No further work is warranted.
However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction, the operators
should immediately stop construction activities in those areas, and contact the project
environmental representative to initiate coordination with the THC prior to resuming any
construction activities.
This interim report serves as partial fulfillment of the requirements of the Antiquities
Permit No. 7969. The results of these investigations will be compiled into a single report
containing all projects completed under Antiquities Permit No. 7969. All project related
documents and photographs will be curated with the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project corridor or Area
of Potential Effect (APE), environmental setting, and methodology; followed by the results of the
investigations and recommendations. This report serves as the cultural resources report to satisfy the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) and National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106
requirements.

1.1 Introduction
As the project cultural resources consultant for Walker Partners, McLennan County, and the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE), Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC. (IES) performed a cultural
resources inventory to locate any prehistoric or historic-period cultural resources. Proposed construction
will transpire within an approximate 1.36-mile long (12.47-acre) corridor that is located along Surrey
Ridge Lane between the Interstate Highway (IH) 35 and Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 3148, McLennan
County, Texas. The APE is plotted on recent aerial photography and the Lorena 7.5-minute series U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) Quadrangle sheets and (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
1.2.1 Direct APE
The proposed project will span the 1.36-mile stretch of Surrey Ridge Lane between IH 35 and FM 3148
and encompass approximately 12.47 acres. Current designs call for the widening and repaving of Surrey
Ridge Lane and will include road restriping, shoulders with roadside drainage ditches, and stormwater
pipe installation. To widen the road, additional right-of-way (ROW) will be acquired along the west and
east sides of Surrey Ridge Lane that will typically be 20 feet wide. The vast majority of the new ROW
that will be acquired will be located along the west side of Surrey Ridge Lane. New ROW, west of
Surrey Ridge Lane, will be acquired from private landowners and has not been previously developed. For
an approximately 0.5 mile section of the APE, new ROW will be acquired on both the west and east sides
existing ROW. Along the east side of Surrey Ridge Lane, an approximate 1.5 acre area will be needed to
construct a culvert from several ponds east of the road underneath Surrey Ridge Lane.
1.2.2 Indirect APE
As the project will require federal permitting from the USACE, an assessment of the indirect effects will
be required within USACE jurisdictional areas to satisfy Section 106 of the NHPA requirements.
Although exact designs are not currently available, elements of the project that will remain aboveground
will be typical for multi-lane roadway. No bridges or elevated components will be constructed as part of
the project. To account for these above ground elements, a 100-foot wide indirect effects APE is
considered surrounding the direct effects APE within USACE jurisdictional areas.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
2.1 Environmental Setting
2.1.1 Climate
McLennan County is in the north-central part of the state of Texas. This region has a humid subtropical
climate and an annual rainfall averaging between approximately 35.01 to 40.00 inches. About half of the
rain usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year.
The humid, temperate climate tends to have long summers and short winters with occasional cold snaps
(Estaville and Earl 2008; Miller et al. 2001).
2.1.2 Topographic Setting
The USGS Lorena 7.5’ Quadrangle map illustrates the APE as located within the margins of an upland
ridge that is dissected by several narrow valleys leading to Chambers Creek. The headwaters of
Chambers Creek are located approximately one mile north of the APE and flow in a generally southeast
direction between approximately 0.25 mile and 0.50 mile east of the APE.
2.1.3 Geology and Soils
The APE is located within the Northern Blackland Prairie, which is characterized by low-relief
topography containing dark, thick, plastic clay soils typical of the Houston Black, Heiden, and Wilson
soil series (Miller and Greenwade 1981). Soils within the APE are underlain by the Austin Chalk
Formation (Kau), characterized by thin beds of marl with interbeds of massive chalk deposits and the
Wolfe City Formation (Kwc), characterized by discontinuous beds of silt, fine-grained sand very fine
grained, and yellow-gray marine megafossils dating to the late Cretaceous (Scoggins 2004) (Figure 2.1).
As shown by the Soil Survey of McLennan County, Texas, there are four mapped soils within the APE
(Table 2.1) (Miller and Greenwade 1981). The entire APE contains soils typical of upland settings
within the Northern Blackland Prairie. Soil data was viewed from the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Web Soil Survey 2017)
(Figure 2.2).

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) maintained by the THC identified that
there are no National Register Properties, historical markers, cemeteries, or previously recorded
archeological sites located within the APE or within one-mile (~1,600 meters [m]) of the APE.
According to TASA records, six cultural resources surveys were previously conducted within one-mile of
the APE (Table 3.1; Attachment A, Figure 3). Two of these surveys were completed directly adjacent
to the northern and southern extents of the APE along IH 35 and FM 3148. The northern survey was
completed in 1998 and was sponsored by the Texas Water Development Board (TWDB). The southern
survey was completed in 2005 and was sponsored by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT).
No cultural sites were recorded during these surveys.

3.2 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
McLennan County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas, Waco Sheet, USGS topographic maps, the NRCS
digital soil database for McLennan County, the Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for Waco,
the National Archives and Records Administration’s (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps
for McLennan County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and both past and current
aerial photography.
3.2.1 Prehistoric Resource Potential
According to the PALM for the Waco TxDOT District, the vast majority of the APE featured a low
potential for containing shallow and deeply buried cultural materials within a reasonable context. A 550foot portion in the northern third and a 300-foot portion of the southern third of the APE contain a
moderate potential for containing cultural materials.
In addition, it was determined that ground-disturbing activities related to past land use and transportation
development have transpired within the vast majority of the APE. The 1915 Center for American History
Postal Routes Map depicted Surrey Ridge Lane was already in use. This road has been improved and
widened through time and has had maintained shoulders and roadside ditches as early as 1980s.

Surrounding Surrey Ridge Lane, the land was primarily used for agricultural and ranching purposes until
the early 2000s when residential subdivisions began appearing along the east side of the road. However,
the west side of Surrey Ridge Lane had remained undeveloped and still nearly entirely used for
agricultural and ranching purposes at the time of the survey. Although the additional ROW to be acquired
was undeveloped, and had avoided significant disturbances from road construction and maintenance, the
overall topographic setting of the APE contained a low potential for prehistoric archeological sites. The
remainder of the APE within the existing Surrey Ridge Lane ROW has a negligible potential.
3.2.2 Historic-Period Resource Potential
Historic-period resources within North-Central Texas are primarily related to farmsteads, houses, and
associated outbuildings and structures that date from the mid-19th to the mid-20th centuries. Typically,
these types of resources are located along old roadways, but can be located along railroads, creeks, and
open pastures. Although determining the presence of the earliest of these buildings and structures was
problematic, thorough and accurate maps depicting these features were widely available post-1914.
Historical aerial photography depicted five historic-aged farmsteads within or directly adjacent to the
APE as early as 1952. The northernmost farmstead contained a dwelling and three outbuildings located
southeast of the intersection of Surrey Ridge Lane and IH 35 Frontage Road and outside the APE. The
buildings and structures were demolished by 2012 during the construction of IH 35 Frontage Road.
The second was identified in historical aerial photography as early as 1952. The farmstead contained a
dwelling, a barn, and one building located on the west side of Surrey Ridge Lane west of modern day
Beauford Street cul-de-sac. Although the dwelling and outbuilding were located adjacent to Surrey Ridge
Lane and were within APE, they were demolished prior to 2003. The barn is approximately 231 feet
southwest of Surrey Ridge Lane and outside the APE.
The third farmstead was approximately 0.43 mile north of FM 3148 along the east side of Surrey Ridge
Lane and outside the APE. The farmstead contained a dwelling and detached garage that were
constructed as early as 1952. The farmstead was demolished between 2012 and 2015.
The fourth farmstead was located approximately 0.36 mile north of FM 3148 along the west side Surrey
Ridge Lane and outside the APE. The farmstead was comprised of a dwelling and two outbuildings that
was constructed prior to 1952. Between 2003 and 2005, these structures were demolished and a new
dwelling and garage were constructed in their place.
The southernmost farmstead was located 0.13 mile north of FM 3148 along the east side of Surrey Ridge
Lane and outside the APE. The farmstead was comprised of a dwelling with three outbuildings that were
demolished by 2011.
Although a significant portion of the APE has been disturbed or located within the existing Surrey Ridge
Lane roadway, due to the previously identified historic-aged farmsteads and the undeveloped setting
along the west side of Surrey Ridge Lane, limited portions of the APE were determined to have a
moderate to high potential for containing historic-aged archeological deposits.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY
The archeological inventory and architectural survey for the Surrey Ridge Lane Widening Project was
conducted on 08 May 2017. The methods and density of excavating shovel test met the minimum
requirements for field tactics stipulated by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for Texas.
Prior to field work, the IES staff conducted an historical and archeological records search to determine
what cultural resources have been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile (1,600 meter [m])
radius of the APE. This information was detailed in Chapter 3. Additionally, IES staff reviewed
ecological, geological, soils data, as well as, historic and recent topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Survey Methods
The 100-percent intensive pedestrian survey consisted of careful examination of the ground surface and
existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. The transect survey
consisted of a single transect scheme that was located within the 20-foot wide additional ROW along the
west and east sides of Surrey Ridge Lane. Areas within the existing Surrey Ridge Lane ROW and
roadway that display high levels of disturbance were photographed to document the lack of potential for
intact archeological deposits. Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps, and shovel
test records.

4.2 Shovel Testing
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to 80 centimeters (cm) or
the bottom of culturally sterile deposits, whichever is encountered first. Each shovel test was 30 cm in
diameter and was hand excavated in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness.
Excavated soil was screened using ¼-inch hardware cloth to test for the presence of buried cultural
material. All tests were recorded on maps and plotted using hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS)
units. Investigators documented the results of each test on standardized shovel test forms. According to
the Archeological Survey Standards of Texas, for linear projects displaying little to no disturbance, 16
shovel tests should be excavated per mile per transect. However, shovel test numbers varied based on the
amount of disturbance, exposed bedrock or culturally sterile soil, ground visibility, and steep slope
present within the APE, or if archeological site(s) are encountered. All positive shovel tests, cultural
features, and other site data was geospatially recorded using Trimble Geo XT handheld GPS unit.

4.3 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation are included in the curation package. All field-generated documents are temporarily
curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and photographs were
organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS
During the pedestrian survey, no cultural resources were encountered within the 1.36-mile long (12.47acre) APE. Shovel test unit locations are illustrated in Figure 5.1 and a photograph location map and
general photographs are located in Appendix A.

5.1 Archeological Survey
5.1.1 Past Ground Disturbances
Through the background review, it was determined that the APE contained a low degree of subsurface
integrity. Significant ground disturbances related to agricultural practices and transportation development
have transpired within the entire APE. Surrey Ridge Lane was constructed prior to 1915 and has
undergone a series of improvements since the 1980s. Agricultural fields bordered Surrey Ridge Lane
until the early 2000s when residential subdivisions were constructed along the east side of the road.
Agricultural and pastoral land use has continued until the time of field survey for a large part of the west
side of Surrey Ridge Lane.
5.1.2 Survey Observations
Field investigations verified the disturbances depicted in historical aerial photographs and documented
that the majority of the APE had been exposed to some form of ground disturbances that would have
affected shallowly buried archeological deposits (Appendix A, Photographs 01 through 24). Identified
disturbances included transportation development and associated infrastructure and agricultural land use.
Outside of the limits of Surrey Ridge Lane, the majority of the APE occupied agricultural fields that were
being cultivated at the time of survey. In areas not being cultivated, the APE includes open yards
associated with households off of Surrey Ridge Lane.
5.1.3 Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
During the IES survey, 27 negative shovel tests were excavated throughout the APE (Figure 5.1). The
majority of the APE utilized a single transect situated on the west side of Surrey Ridge Lane.
Concentration was placed on the west side of Surrey Ridge Lane due to the fact that the existing road was
along the margins of the APE’s eastern boundary leaving the western boundary location in largely
undeveloped land. South of Palomino Trail, the APE transitioned to be more centered along Surrey
Ridge Lane with equal-part undeveloped land on both the eastern and western portion of the road. Along
this portion of the APE, two transects were utilized running parallel to Surrey Ridge Lane. Shovel tests
were excavated at an approximate 100 m interval along transects.
Shovel testing within the APE revealed a predominant soil type containing brown clay loam (10YR 3/2)
containing frequent small gravel and larger rocks. Shovel tests rarely exceeded 35 centimeters below
surface (cmbs) in depth due to extremely compact soils and quantity of gravel. Shovel testing revealed no
cultural materials. In addition to shovel testing, subsurface exposures including animal burrows, disturbed
patches, and eroded areas were examined.
5.1.4 Indirect APE Assessment
To satisfy NHPA requirements, visual impacts were assessed. Historical maps and modern aerial
photographs indicated the indirect APE was void of historic-period resources. The indirect effects
assessment verified the current land use identified through background review. The indirect APE
majority of the indirect APE occupied open land and water features. A small portion of the indirect APE
encroached into a housing track constructed between 2005 and 2008.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
During the pedestrian survey, 27 negative shovel tests were excavated within the 1.36-mile (12.47-acre)
APE. No cultural resources were encountered within the direct and indirect APE.
Therefore, it is the recommendation of IES that the Surrey Ridge Lane Widening Project be permitted to
continue without the need for further cultural resource investigations. However, if any cultural resources,
other than those detailed within this report, are encountered during construction, the operators should stop
construction activities immediately in those areas. The project environmental consultant should then be
contacted to initiate further consultation with the THC/SHPO prior to resuming construction activities.
This interim report serves as partial fulfillment of the requirements of the Antiquities Permit No. 7969.
The results of these investigations will be compiled into a single report containing all projects completed
under Antiquities Permit No. 7969.
