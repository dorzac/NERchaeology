ABSTRACT

An intensive pedestrian archaeological site survey was
conducted of an approximately 17 acre site located in
Longview in Gregg County, Texas on February 20, 2007
by AR Consultants, Inc. The proposed development site is
located east of and adjacent to FM 145 and west of an
intermittent tributary to Iron Bridge Creek. The survey was
done for Adams Consulting Engineers, Inc. which is doing
the environmental permitting for the Lowe’s Corporation.
A records search did not reveal any historic or prehistoric
cultural resources in the study area. Analysis of aerial
photographs over time indicates the increasing disturbance
to the study area. A comprehensive survey of the tract and
thirteen shovel tests only located an isolated buried
quartzite secondary flake within the heavily disturbed
proposed development site.
Based upon the absence of archaeological sites, the planned
project should proceed and we ask that the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and
the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers
(FWCOE) agree with our recommendation. However, if
buried cultural materials are discovered during
construction, work in that area should stop and the
Archeology Division of the THC and the FWCOE should
be notified.

LOWE’S LONGVIEW DEVELOPMENT SITE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY

INTRODUCTION
On February 20, 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey of a proposed Lowe’s commercial development site which is to be
situated on approximately 17 acres located in Longview in Gregg County, Texas. The
proposed development site is located west of and adjacent to FM 145, west of an
intermittent tributary to Iron Bridge Creek and about 1,085 feet southeast of US 20
(Figure 1). The archaeological survey was done for the Adams Consulting Engineers, Inc.
which is doing the environmental permitting for the Lowe’s Corporation. Lowe’
Corporation does not own the land at this time but has acquired rights to do an
archaeological survey.
The purpose of the survey was to locate any cultural resources that are present within the
project limits and to make recommendations about their significance and how they might
be impacted by construction. The scope of the project included a records review, a field
survey during which sites found were to be recorded and during which shovel testing was
to be carried out, and a final report. Since a tributary toIron Bridge Creek is within the
study area, possible relevant federal regulations includes the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974,
as amended (PL-93-291). Although the Texas Antiquities Code does not apply, the report
has been formatted as per the guidelines for a letter report suggested by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (N.D.).

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is located in the forested region of East Texas. The topography of the
surrounding area is the dissected rolling upland near the upper end of the watershed on
the west side of Grace Creek. The Eocene age Queen City Sand formation underlies the
entire survey area, in fact all of the upland between the valleys of the Sabine River to the
south and Little Cypress Creek to the north (Bureau of Economic Geology 1965). The
Queen City formation is composed of quartz sand and clay along with concretions and
ledges of ironstone and ferruginous sandstone.
Soils in the survey area are the upland association known as the Bowie-Cuthbert-Kirvin
(Roberts 1983:General Soil Map). Specific soils consist of Bienville loamy fine sand with
0 to 3 degree slopes, Cuthbert fine sandy loam with 8 to 25 percent slopes and Kullit very
fine sandy loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes (Roberts 1983:Sheet 42). The tributary does
not appear on the Soils Map for Upshur and Gregg County, Texas. The majority of the
soil in the study area consists of Cuthbert fine sandy loam which has a subsoil described
as being 8 inches (20 centimeters) below the ground surface (Roberts 1983:53).
The tributary to Iron Bridge Creek is mapped as intermittent on the USGS map.

CULTURE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Archaeological investigations in Gregg County are limited to a number of small-scale
investigations. For extensive review of archaeological work in the surrounding area the
reader is referred to these sources and to the descriptive reports on which they are based
as well as the recent and comprehensive synthesis prepared by Dee Ann Story et al.
(1990).
The earliest known Native American occupation of the region was during the PaleoIndian period. Such sites are essentially unknown in Gregg County (Meltzer and Bever
1995:50), although Story (1990:185) mentions the presence of Clovis points associated
with mammoth bones at the Murphey site which is near the dam at Lake O’ the Pines to
the north. Jones (1957) mentions the presence of Paleo-Indian artifacts in the county, but

does not discuss them in detail. The subsequent Archaic period began about 9,000 years
ago and ended circa 200 B.C. The lifeway continued as a hunting and gathering
adaptation until the appearance of ceramics and the bow and arrow. The Archaic is best
known for a wide variety of dart points and the presence of groundstone tools (Perttula et
al. 1986:48-53).
The presence of pottery in East Texas sites signals the beginning of the Early Ceramic
period from 200 B.C. to A.D. 800. During this period, a more sedentary lifestyle was
adopted and farming had begun. Burial mounds are known from surrounding areas, but
not from the Cypress Creek basin to the north. The lifeway was similar to that of the
Archaic people, except that the bow and arrow may have been introduced late in this
period. The prehistoric Caddoan period lasted from A.D. 800 to 1680, and extended into
the historic period. Decorated pottery and arrow points are two major markers for the
Caddoan period, and it has been shown that farming was a major source for food, along
with hunting and some gathering. Villages are located along major streams early in the
period and move into the headwaters of tributaries later in time (Perttula 1992). Earthen
mounds have been reported from the Big Cypress Creek drainage to the north and the
Sabine River to the south.
Historic Native American occupation has been documented in the surrounding area, and
Buddy Jones (1968) has described two historic Caddoan or subsequent intrusive Native
American sites in Gregg County. The Cherokee Trace is a transportation route through
the area that is believed to have roots in the historic Native American utilization of the
area. Historic settlement in the Longview area began in earnest about 1850 and has
continued to the present. Farming and timbering were major sources of income in the
area, and cotton was a major farm product until the middle of the twentieth century.
No sites are listed within the study area on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (2007).
However, according to the Atlas, site 41GG32 was recorded by the Bill Young family
and is located about 1,632 feet northwest of the study area. A dart point and 5 lithic tools
were collected from the site. The site is now beneath US 20. A historic site (41GG80)
was recorded by SWCA and is located about 2,439 feet southeast of the study area. The
site consists of remnants of a 1900s to 1950s residence with an associated historic trash
scatter. Only the location is provided for site 41GG18 which is located approximately
1,858 feet south, southeast of the study area.

METHODOLOGY
Based upon the presence of recorded sites in the area, both prehistoric and historic sites
might be present within the study area. Also, it appears that residences are present
southeast of the study area on the 1983 Lakeport USGS map. In order to find any site, the
archaeologists walked east-west oriented meandering transects spaced approximately 30
m apart. Shovel testing was done on a judgmental basis in the upland setting as
recommended by the Council of Texas Archeologists (2002) and accepted by the Texas
Historical Commission. Shovel tests were excavated until the subsoil was encountered.
The sandy loam and loamy sand was screened through a ¼-inch hardwire screen and the

pit walls were visually examined for cultural materials. Notes on the topography, soil,
vegetation and on other relevant information were made. Photographs were taken.
Backhoe testing was not done, due to the shallowness of the topsoil and the absence of
aggradation in the upland setting.

RESULTS
A description of the survey area is presented first and is followed by a discussion of the
survey area. Shovel tests are described generally in the text, but specific information is
provided in Table 1. Shovel test locations are shown on Figure 1.
The survey area
The survey area consists of a southwest sloping area west and southeast of a northwestsoutheast trending ridge. Trees include pine, American elm, winged elm and hackberry.
Understory vegetation consists of saw greenbriar, grape vine and native grasses and
bushes. The land had been disturbed due to prior timbering activities. The increase in
disturbance in the study area is able to be seen over time. Three aerial photographs are
presented to illustrate that disturbance over time. The terrain was hummocky, similar to
those that result from tree removal, and push piles (Figure 6) were abundant. In addition,
roads had been bulldozed (Figure 7) throughout the area. Due to prior disturbance,
ground visibility was at least 60 percent and eye-height varied from 30 to 100+ meters.
Iron Bridge Creek is approximately 7 m wide and the banks are about a meter high. The
channel itself is only about 30 cm across (Figure 8). Push piles were evident along the
east bank. Palmetto trees were present along the drainage along with the prior described
vegetation.
The survey
Survey began in the northeast corner and went west. Shovel test (hereafter ST) 1 was
placed on a slight knoll just south of the Perry-Clay Cemetery. The shovel test uncovered
28 cm of sandy loam overlying sandy clay. Shovel test 2 also was excavated on a slight
knoll and encountered soils similar to ST 1 but the contact was at 50 cm and the shovel
test was terminated at 61 cm below the ground surface. Shovel test 3 was placed on a
bench and uncovered 11 cm of loamy sand overlying sand that extended to 35 cm which
in turn overlaid sandy clay that extended to 37+ cm below the ground surface. All of the
shovel tests were culturally sterile and no cultural materials older than 50 years were seen
on the ground surface.
Shovel test 4 encountered 3 cm of fill overlying sandy clay that extended to 7+ cm below
the ground surface and ST 5 uncovered 11 cm of sandy loam overlying sandy clay that
ranged to 14+ cm below the ground surface. The shovel tests were culturally sterile and
no artifacts older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface to ST 5.

area.

A secondary quartzite flake was uncovered in ST 6 at 25 cm below the ground surface in
sandy loam that extended to 38 cm which overlaid sandy clay that ranged to 51+ cm
below the ground surface. In order to determine if other buried cultural materials were
present, 4 shovel tests (7 through 10) were placed approximately 6 m southwest,
southeast, northwest and northeast of ST 6. The shovel tests encountered sandy loam
overlying sandy clay. The soil horizons were at 35, 29, 32 and 27 cm, respectively, and
the shovel tests were terminated at 39, 33, 32 and 27 cm below the ground surface,
respectively. All were culturally sterile. No cultural materials older than 50 years were
seen on the ground surface to ST 10.
Shovel test 11 uncovered 7 cm of loamy sand overlying sandy clay that extended to 11+
cm below the ground surface and ST 12 encountered the same soil matrices but the
contact was 6 cm and the shovel test was terminated at 9 cm below the ground surface.
Shovel test 13 uncovered 7 cm of loamy sandy clay overlying sandy clay that extended to
13+ cm below the ground surface. The shovel tests were culturally sterile and no cultural

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Only one quartzite flake was found during the intensive pedestrian archaeological survey
and shovel testing. Any prehistoric sites may have been destroyed and/or removed during
the bulldozing activities and tree removal. The presence of fill further indicates
disturbance to the area. The absence of historic sites also may be attributed to the same
reason. The disturbance to the study area was done by other companies who owned the
land. At this moment, Lowe’s does not own the land, but has acquired rights to conduct
an archaeological survey. It is AR Consultants’ recommendation that the Lowe’s
Corporation should proceed and request that the Texas Historical Commission agree to
that recommendation No other cultural resources investigations are warranted in the
survey area, unless cultural resources are discovered during construction. If this should
happen, work should immediately cease in that area and the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission and the Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of
Engineers should be notified. Although not part of the survey area, caution is urged
during construction adjacent to the Perry-Clay Cemetery.
