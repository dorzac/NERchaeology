ABSTRACT

Geoarchaeological Investigations at the McNeill-Gonzales Site
(41VT141), Victoria County, Texas. (May 2006)
Michael John Aiuvalasit, B.A., The University of Texas at Austin
Chair of Advisory Committee: Dr. Michael R. Waters

The McNeill-Gonzales site is a stratified multi-component prehistoric site in
Victoria County, Texas. The site is located in approximately 2 meters of fine sand that
mantle a fluvial terrace of the Guadalupe River. Geoarchaeological investigations were
conducted at this site to determine the stratigraphy of the archaeological deposits, the
processes that led to the formation of the site, and the integrity of the archaeological
deposits. Three Holocene deposits of fine sand are mantling the tread and slope of a
Pleistocene fluvial terrace of the Deweyville Formation. Granulometric studies and the
stratigraphic position of the sands suggest the deposits are eolian in nature. Artifacts
from the Late Paleoindian period (10,000 B.P.) to the Historic period were found in
generally good stratigraphic position and made possible the correlation of the three
deposits of fine sand across the site. There is evidence of bioturbation across the entire
site and disturbance by colluvial action on the southeastern slopes of the site; however,
intact human burials, hearth features, and artifacts in stratigraphic position indicate that
secondary processes have not completely compromised the integrity of the
archaeological deposits.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

As with any archaeological project, this work owes a great debt to a number of
individuals. First I must thank my advisor, Dr. Michael Waters, whose considerable
knowledge and pragmatic approach kept me focused on completing my research. Next I
thank the remainder of my committee: Dr. David Carlson for his help with the
archaeological section, and Dr. Brian Willis for entertaining the questions of an
archaeologist pretending to be a geologist. Other faculty members have provided
assistance, whether in instruction or help during my research. I would like to thank the
late Dr. Robson Bonnichsen, Dr. Vaughan Bryant, Dr. Alston Thoms, and Dr. Vatche
Tchakerian. A special thank you goes to Dr. Thomas Hallmark and his lab director Mrs.
Donna Prochaska for the training and lab time to process soil samples at the Soils
Characterization Lab in the Department of Soil and Crop Sciences.
The McNeill family deserves special appreciation from not only me but also the
entire archaeological community. Not only are they protecting an important site on their
property, but encouraging and facilitating archaeological research. Three generations of
the McNeill family have been gracious hosts to me and other researchers. Without their
support this project would not have been possible.
Mr. James Bluhm deserves special gratitude for all his work in discovering the
site, developing a strong working relationship with the McNeil family, directing the test
excavations at the site, and promoting the site to the archaeological community. His
efforts on this and other archaeological projects as a Texas Historical Commission
Steward deserve recognition from both the public and archaeological community.

v

I would like to thank the rest of the THC stewards and volunteers who have done
a tremendous job excavating and processing artifacts at the site. Special thanks go to
Mr. Bill Birmingham, Mr. Nelson Marek, Mrs. Pat Braun, and especially Mrs. Helen
Shook.
Other researchers outside A&M provided significant help. Mr. Wes Miller and
Ms. Amanda Bragg of the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) deserve
special thanks for bringing out a coring truck to excavate deep cores during some
inhospitable weather. I thank Dr. Steven Forman of the University of Illinois at Chicago
for analyzing my OSL samples. Dr. Charles Frederick, Dr. Bob Ricklis, and Dr. Ken
Brown gave valuable perspectives on research issues of the region. I appreciate the
advice Dr. Chris Caran and Dr. Steven Black have given me throughout my developing
career in archaeology.
I would like to thank the Council of Texas Archeologists and the Texas
Archeological Societies Donorâs Fund for providing financial support for the OSL
samples. Thanks go out to my archaeological colleagues who helped in the field: David
Foxe, Robert Lassen, Jessi Halligan, Tim Riley and John and Adrianne Campbell. I also
appreciate the help of the other researchers conducting work at the site: Matt Taylor, Dr.
Jennifer Rice, and Dr. Michael Bever.
I have to thank my family for always supporting and encouraging the path I have
found myself on. They raised me to follow my dreams, so Iâm sticking to them. I must
thank my new wife Leslie. I couldnât have completed this without her encouragement,
strength, and love. Sheâs going to be a much better wife than my thesis ever was.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION

The McNeill-Gonzales site (41VT141) is a stratified multi-component prehistoric
archaeological site in Victoria Co., Texas. The site, located on private property, was
accidentally discovered during removal of topsoil for commercial sale. The
archaeological community discovered the site in 2003 when Texas Historical
Commission (THC) Archaeological Steward, James Bluhm, traced the topsoil being sold
with artifacts back to the property of its excavation. Upon learning that the topsoil
removal was damaging an archaeological site, the landownerâs suspended the borrow pit
operation and THC stewards began salvage and test excavations at the site. The
excavations and lab analysis by the THC Stewards recovered a number of prehistoric
human burials and artifacts from the Late Paleoindian period (10,000 B.P.) to the
Historic period. The THC Stewards have made their discoveries available for viewing to
the larger archaeological community and the site has been acknowledged by visits from
state archaeologists, the academic community, and cultural resource professionals for its
potential to contribute to the archaeological knowledge of the region.
In the spring of 2004 the Texas A&M University (TAMU) Center for the Study of First
Americans (CSFA) was contacted and a team of TAMU archaeologists and physical
anthropologists visited the site. The team led by the late Dr. Robson Bonnichsen saw

2

great potential for the burials and archaeological findings from this site to provide
evidence of the earliest inhabitants of the region, and Dr. Michael Waters encouraged
my participation. The THC Stewards welcomed the involvement of the TAMU
Department of Anthropology and since the summer of 2004 I have conducted
geoarchaeological investigations at the McNeill- Gonzales site. Granulometric analysis
was conducted during the summer and fall of 2005 in the Soil Characterization Labs at
TAMU, and Dr. Steve Forman of the University of Illinois at Chicago analyzed OSL
samples during the winter of 2006.
Project Goals
The goals of the geoarchaeological investigation are threefold: (1) to describe
and interpret the cultural and natural stratigraphy at the site; (2) develop a chronology of
these deposits; and (3) make interpretations of the archaeological record from these data.
This study will determine how archaeological materials that span the Holocene became
buried in an alluvial terrace that is identified as being Pleistocene in age. It is
hypothesized that a combination of colluvial, eolian, and bioturbating processes led to
the burial of archaeological deposits in a sandy mantle that overlays a paleosol and
underlying fluvial deposits of the Pleistocene terrace. The sands of this potentially
eolian sandy mantle are hypothesized to derive from the local reworking of fluvial
deposits. Examining the complex relationships of sediments, soils, paleosols, and
archaeological materials across the site and adjacent landforms through field and lab
investigations tests these hypotheses. Conversely, if the deposits at the McNeillGonzales site do not correlate to sedimentological and stratigraphic models for

3

deposition by eolian, colluvial, or fluvial transport than the deposits could only have
been buried through a complex process of bio- and pedoturbation of Deweyville
formation sediments.
The second goal of this project is to develop a chronological framework for the
site by establishing stratigraphic relationships of deposits across the terrace from
diagnostic artifacts. Previously reported archeometric dates of burials at the site, as well
as the luminescence dating of sediments reported in this thesis will establish a
chronology that further defines the stratigraphic context of the site. Specifically, if dates
of sediments from below the paleosol in the fluvial sediments are Pleistocene in age and
sediments from above the paleosol are Holocene than a model of site burial in
Pleistocene sediments through bio- and pedo-turbation processes is untenable.
The ultimate contribution of the geoarchaeological research at the McNeillGonzales site is to interpret the stratigraphic and chronological data in order to
understand the evidence of prehistoric human behavior at both a site and regional level.
At this time analysis of the archaeological materials by the THC Stewards is ongoing, so
limited data from the analyses of artifacts and the burials are available for interpretation.
Observations of site integrity, and interpretations of paleo- landscapes are possible, and
future excavations will benefit greatly from having a geoarchaeological model of the site
to guide excavations.
Methods
A combination of field and lab work was required for this geoarchaeological
investigation. Profiles exposed during topsoil excavation and test units excavated by the

4

THC Stewards were recorded using methods and terminology specified by the USDA
Soil Survey Division Staff (1993), as well as common stratigraphic nomenclature. Hand
augering, backhoe trenching, and mechanical coring were employed to examine
subsurface portions of the site and adjacent areas. A map of the site was created using a
transit, Sokkia Total Data Station (TDS) and Garmin Geko 201 GPS Receiver.
Archaeological data from the THC Stewards excavations was used to provide the
stratigraphic position of diagnostic artifacts across the site and densities of
archaeological material by unit level in Excavation Area 4. Granulometric and limited
chemical characterization of sediments was determined using the Soils Characterization
Lab in the Agronomy Department of Texas A&M. Granulometric analyses methods
followed Kilmer and Alexander (1949) and the Soil Survey Laboratory Staff (1996).
Granulometric data was statistically analyzed in order to compare grain size distributions
to models of soil formation and sediment deposition. Dr. Steve Forman of the
University of Illinois at Chicago analyzed two sediment samples using Optically
Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) to provide dates of the underlying fluvial deposits and
colluvial deposits that contained scattered, undated artifacts. Pollen samples from the
site were processed and analyzed in the Palynology Laboratory in the Department of
Anthropology at Texas A&M to assess the potential for pollen recovery from the
archaeological deposits.
The thesis is organized to facilitate the use of these data by the widest range of
practitioners. First the physiographic, geological, environmental, and archaeological
contexts are defined. This is followed by the description and interpretation of the

5

stratigraphic units at the site. The stratigraphy of the archaeological deposits follows,
with archaeological interpretations and implications for regional geomorphic studies
concluding the work. In order to keep the body of the text free of copious tables and
data the appendices contain the majority these data. The detailed core, auger, backhoe
trench, excavation unit, and borrow pit exposure descriptions are found in Appendix A.
Granulometric data are found in Appendix B. Artifact distributions of excavation units
are found in Appendix C. The study of the potential to recover pollen from the
Holocene deposits is found in Appendix D.

CHAPTER II
SITE SETTING

Geologic and Physiographic Setting
Regional Geology. The McNeill-Gonzales site is located in the southeastern
portion of Texas (Figure 1). The geologic area is the south-central portion of the West
Gulf Coastal Plain. The boundaries of this region are the Balcones Escarpment to the
north and northwest, the Rio Grande and the Sierra Madre Oriental to the south and
southwest, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south and southeast. The West Gulf Coast
Plain extends east and northeast through Texas and Louisiana to the Mississippi River.
The geologic deposits of the region range from the Late Mesozoic through the Cenozoic,
and were deposited along the prograding margin of the Gulf of Mexico. Older layers
were successively overlain by younger sediments, which created an arcuate pattern of
deposits parallel to the Gulf Coast. The gently dipping beds of ancient littoral, estuarine,
deltaic, and fluvial deposits form the rolling to level surfaces of the Coastal Plain.
Parallel low ridges of resistant units, called cuestas, punctuate the plains. The cuestas
have gentle slope gulfward to the southeast and steeper northwest- facing escarpments
(Bryant et al. 1991: 17).
The Reynosa Plateau is the most coastward cuesta, expressed on the surface in
Bordes-Oakville Escarpment on the northwest side and a low ridge on the eastern
boundary called the Reynosa cuesta where the deposits dip below later Plio-Pleistocene
deposits of the Willis and Lissie Formation (Price 1933). The Reynosa Cuesta derives

7

Figure 1. Regional map with sites mentioned in text (based on USGS 2001)

from the Goliad Formation, which are of Miocene age and contain thick caliche deposits
that are resistant to erosion (Miller 1979: 87). The Guadalupe River forms the northern
boundary of the Reynosa Plateau, and to the north, the Hockley scarp separates
coastward Pleistocene Lissie Formation fluvial deposits from interior Plio-Pleistocene
Willis Formation deposits (Thornbury 1965:63-65). The McNeill-Gonzales site is
located on a terrace of the Guadalupe River just northeast of the Reynosa Plateau (Figure
2).

Late Quaternary Geology and Geomorphology. After the Guadalupe River
passes the Reynosa Plateau it enters the level Coastal Plain deposits of fluvial, deltaic,
and estuarine sediments that can be correlated to Pleistocene glacial cycles. Small
exposures of the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene Willis Formation fluviatile deposits
exist on the uplands to the north of the site (Figure 3.). The uplands immediately
adjacent to the McNeill- Gonzales site are mapped as Lissie Formation, which are
considered to be early to middle Pleistocene and consist of sandy fluvial deposits
(Barnes 1987).

9

Figure 3. Region geologic units (Barnes 1987)

The uplands adjacent to the McNeill-Gonzales site are mapped as Lissie,
however the soils are mapped as Lake Charles clay, which is widely considered to form
in Beaumont Formation deposits (Barnes 1987, Miller 1979, Miller personal
communication 2004). Because of this though the deposits are mapped as Lissie, the
tested uplands in the project area will be considered Beaumont. The Beaumont
Formation Pleistocene fluvial, estuary-marsh, and littoral deposits of dominate large
portions of the Coastal Plain. Recent synthesis of chronometric data from across the
Coastal Plain (Figure 4) has shown the Beaumont Formation to be diachronous, with
deposits ranging from 116-74 ka to 74-30 ka (Otvos 2005). Locally,

10

thermoluminescence dating of the Beaumont Formation along the margins of the Nueces
River produced dates of 91.7 + 7.9 ka and 71.9 + 6.9 ka (Durbin et al: 1997: 122).
The Guadalupe River is one of the numerous major drainages that have their source on
the Edwards Plateau and drain across the Western Coastal Plain into the Gulf of Mexico.
It flows approximately 230 miles (370 km) and drains an area of approximately 6,070
square miles (15,720 km2 ). There are three post-Beaumont alluvial deposits associated
with the Guadalupe River. According to Barnes (1987) they are: 1) Fluviatile terraces
undetermined, which are fluvial deposits along the valley walls that could possibly
correlate to any of the Pleistocene deposits; 2) the Deweyville Formation which consists
of fluvial deposits with relict meanders of a much larger radius and curvature than the
modern channel; and 3) Holocene alluvial deposits (Figure 5). Of these deposits the
Deweyville Formation deserves the most attention because the McNeill- Gonzales site is
situated on the slope of what is mapped as a Deweyville Terrace.
Luminescence dating is providing a clearer understanding of the Deweyville
terraces across the Coastal Plain (Blum et al 1995, Durbin et al 1997, Sylvia and
Galloway 2002, Otvos 2005). Synthesis of dates on a regional level from across the
Gulf Coastal Plain suggests that the Deweyville terraces aggraded from between 60 and
18 ka, however the aggradation and incision sequences are not coeval between different
valleys of the Coastal Plain. Otvos (2005) compared dates of samples from six localities
across the Coastal Plain and found that typically a series of up to three post-Beaumont
terraces with large arcuate relict meanders are cut into older valley margins. This

12

confirms the ages presented in a local study of the Lower Nueces River, which is the
next major river valley to the south of the Guadalupe River (Durbin et al: 1997, Durbin
1999). Durbin et al (1997: 122) dated the three periods of Deweyville terrace
aggradation, which they classified as High Deweyville 60â47 ka; Middle Deweyville
43â40 ka; and Low Deweyville 35â31 ka. The only known published date for a
Deweyville terrace on the Guadalupe River comes from geoarchaeological investigations
at the Buckeye Knoll site, which is located approximately 30 km downstream from the
McNeill-Gonzales site. Five dates of sediments below archaeological deposits in the
terrace dated from between 49 and 53 ka correspond to the High Deweyville deposits of
the Nueces River (Frederick and Bateman 2004: 10).
The formation of the Deweyville terraces occurred during the Wisconsonian
(Isotope Stage 3) glaciation period of the Pleistocene. During this time sea levels
dropped dramatically due to moisture being sequestered by glaciers. By the end of this
period during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at approximately 20 ka shorelines
along the Gulf of Mexico dropped to the mid-shelf and edge of the continental shelf,
approximately 200 to 300 km from the modern shoreline. Due to this cha nge in base
level, channels of the major drainages lengthened and down cut into the Beaumont
Formation. During this cooler, drier period the preserved Deweyville terrace sediments
are thick channel belt sands with few overbank mud deposits that commonly have a
well-drained paleosol bounding the top of the deposits. The interglacial period, which
ended the Pleistocene, caused a transgression of sea level and increase of inland
moisture. Although the increase of inland moisture caused an increase in stream

13

discharge, which caused some channel incision, rising sea level lowered stream gradients
(Blum and Tornqvist 2000: 33). This caused the drainages to accommodate more
sediments as muddy overbank deposits in the floodplain during the Late Pleistocene and
Holocene. Aggradation led to the burial of some Low Deweyville terraces (Abbott
2001: 99). The high position of the Deweyville terrace at the McNeill-Gonzales site is
inferred to be an older High Deweyville terrace and that younger Low Deweyville
terraces may be buried in the modern floodplain.
Eolian deposits comprise another geomorphic landform of the Gulf Coastal Plain.
There are two types of eolian landforms in the Gulf Coastal Plain: coastal zone dune
fields of reworked littoral sediments, and thin sandy mantles and mounds located on
high terraces, floodplains, and upland margins of streams (Abbott 2001: 50). There is
little question about the eolian origin of the coastal dune fields, but the sandy mantle
deposits are poorly understood. Debate on the depositional mechanisms of the mantle
deposits exist because the process of their formation has not been observed, they
typically lack intact bedding where disrupted by soil formation and bioturbation (Abbott
2001, Aten and Bollich 1981, and Heinrich 1993). Recent work by Otvos (2004)
provides chronological and paleoclimatic interpretations for eolian features across the
Gulf Coastal Plain. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), thermoluminescence
(TL), and archaeological materials were used to date eolian deposits. Dune deposits
ranged in age from post-Beaumont through the Holocene, and of these samples ten
prairie mounds were dated. Of the samples collected from prairie mounds in Texas and
southwestern Louisiana the majority dated from between 1,600 and 800 yr ago, but two

14

samples dated to 6,000 yr and 3,000 yr ago. All samples were uncomformably resting
on Beaumont or older surfaces (Otvos 2004: 114). Eolian deposits suggest a degree of
aridity during the Late Holocene, which is supported by evidence of aridity during this
time from faunal records of the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas and eolian features of
Southern High Plains (Holliday 2002, Toomey et al 1993). Unfortunately Otvos did not
sample any dunes from Deweyville Terraces or other fe atures further inland that have
questionable eolian origins, so currently there is no consensus on the ages, depositional
mechanisms, and structure of these deposits observed in the interior Coastal Plain.
Soils. The soils of the McNeill- Gonzales site and the surrounding landforms
have clear relationships to the area geology. All descriptions come from the Soil Survey
of Victoria County (Miller 1979: 147) (Figure 6). The Beaumont-Lissie Formation
uplands of clayey coastal marsh, deltaic deposits are mapped as Lake Charles (LaA) and
Decosta (DaA) Series. The Lake Charles Series is classified as fine, montmorillonitic,
thermic Typic Pelluderts. The Decosta Series are fine, montmorillonitic, hyperthermic
Vertic Ochraqualfs. The gradual scarp of the Beaumont Formation has a complex series
of soils that have mixture of properties of the clayey uplands and sandy deposits of the
Deweyville Formation terrace. The soils of the scarp are mapped as Telferner (TeA and
TeB), Dacosta-Contee Complex (DnA), and DaCosta and Telferner (DvC). DacostaContee Complex (DnA) is described as being located in depressions of Beaumont
uplands. The steepest slope of the scarp is mapped as DaCosta and Telferner (DvC).
Telferner soils are fine sandy loams that are classified as fine montmorillonitic,
hyperthermic Typic Albaqualfs.

15

Figure 6. Project area soil series (Miller 1979)

The Deweyville Terrace is mapped as Kuy (KyC) loamy sand and Fortran (FoB)
loamy fine sand. The Kuy series are deep loamy sands classified as loamy, siliceous,
hyperthermic Grossarenic Paleudalfs, and though Fortran series are described as deep
loamy fine sands that are classified as clayey, mixed, hyperthermic Grossarenic
Paleudalfs. The floodplain of the Guadalupe River consists of three soil series, Meguin
(Me), Sinton (Sn), and Trinity (To). Starting from the soils immediately adjacent to the
Deweyville terrace, the Trinity (To) are occasionally flooded deep clays that are
classified as very- fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Typic Pelluderts whereas the Meguin

16

(Me) occasionally flooded deep silty clays are classified as fine-silty, mixed,
hyperthermic Fluventic Haplustolls. The Sinton (Sn) soils are developing along the
active channel and overbank deposits of the Guadalupe River. They are classified as
fine- loamy, mixed, hyperthermic Cumulic Haplustolls.
The soils of the McNeill-Gonzales site are mapped as Kuy series. Kuy soils are
found on upland terraces along streams and make up only 1.2 percent of the soils of
Victoria County. The surface A horizon is a slightly acid, light brownish gray loamy
sand about 15 cm thick. The A21 horizon is slightly acid, light gray loam sand from 15
to 101 cm. The A22 horizon is from 101 cm to 130 cm and is mildly alkaline white
loamy sand. The B2tg horizon is strongly acid, mottled, light gray sandy clay loam
subsoil that was described to the depth of 203 cm. The soil is moderately well drained,
with moderate permeability, and low available water capacity. There is a perched water
table at a depth of 90 to 150 cm during rainy seasons. Surface runoff is very slow and
the potential for water erosion is slight (Miller 1979: 22). Detailed descriptions of the
site soils will be described in the next chapter.
Environmental Setting
Modern Climate and Biota. General interpretations of the environment are
derived from the ecoregion systems interpretations of Omernik (1987), from local
environmental data sets acquired from the USDA Soil Series guide for Victoria County
(Miller 1979), and from a report on groundwater resources of Texas (Keese et al 2004).
The region is considered a warm temperate climate, with a mean rainfall of 965 mm and
a mean temperature of 21.2Â°C. The mean wettest month is September, and the mean

17

driest month is March. The mean wettest month correlates to the period of the year
when tropical storms from the Gulf of Mexico move in from the west. The average last
freeze of the spring is March 6 and the average first freeze of the fall is November 12
(Miller 1979).
On a continental scale the Western Gulf Coastal Plain is a subregion of the Great
Plains. This subregion is further divided into: the mid-Coastal Barrier Islands and
Marshes along the San Antonio Bay, Northern Humid Gulf Coastal Prairies that form the
level clayey uplands of the Beaumont and Lissie Formation, and the complex
Floodplains and Low Terraces of the Guadalupe River. The vegetation types by region
are: sea-oats and seacoast bluestem grasses in the mid-Coastal Barrier Islands and
Marshes; smooth cordgrass with post oak motts in the Northern Humid Gulf Coastal
Prairies; and predominantly deciduous hardwoods on the Floodplains and Low Terraces
(Griffith et al 2004, Omernik 1987: Table 1, and Telfair 1999:19). Vegetation of the
McNeill-Gonzales site is dominated by deciduous hardwoods along the edge of the
terrace and a mixture of grasses and forbs on the level terrace surface. The deciduous
species observed in the immediate vicinity of the site are Quercus (oak), Prosopis
(mesquite), Carya (pecan), Celtis (hackberry), Ehretria elliptica (anaqua), and Ulmus
(elm). The flowering forbs are typically Asteraceae (sunflower/daisy family), Lupinus
(bluebonnet), Urticia (nettle), Solanum (nightshade), Castilleja (paintbrush), Argemone
(prickly poppy), and numerous unidentified graminoids (grasses). A surface soil sample
analyzed for a study of the potential to recover pollen from sediments recovered many of
the species observed in the site area (Appendix D).

18

Within this region 250 edible taxa have been identified which could have been
consumed or used by aboriginal peoples (Abbott 2001: 36). Floral resources can be
divided into five categories: high protein masts such as hickory and pecan; seeds from
amaranths and graminoids; fruits such as blackberries, mulberries, prickly pear tunas,
mesquite beans and anaqua fruit; roots such as arrow root and wild onions; and greens
such as prickly pear pads.
The faunal resources of the region are diverse and variable in their distribution.
Waterfowl, mollusks, and fish are located in mid-Coastal Barrier Islands and Marshes
Region. A number of species, such as black drum, redfish and sea trout come to the
lower salinity waters of bays, lagoons and tidal passes of the to spawn and then spend
their adulthood in deep waters (Ricklis 1996: 15). The McNeill-Gonzales site is much to
far inland to directly exploit these resources, however it is well situated to exploit
resources of the Coastal Prairies and the complex Floodplains and Low Terraces of the
Guadalupe River. White-tailed deer, amphibians, freshwater fish, mussels, and squirrels
are found in the bottomlands of the major rivers. The Coastal Prairies see deer and
rabbit, as well as prairie chicken and doves. Bison were present historically on the
Coastal Prairies (Ricklis 1996: 21, Telfair 1999:19-21). Deer are the dominant large
game animal. The Coastal Prairies have the second highest deer population in the state.
Data on modern deer populations shows an intraregional difference in deer populations
of coastal and immediately interior counties (Texas Parks and Wildlife 2003).
Paleoenvironment. Abbott (2001) provides the most recent and comprehensive
summary of paleoenvironmental conditions of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain.

19

Numerous lines of evidence augmented by data sets from adjacent regions are used to
interpret past climates, and sea level change. These sources include: palynological
records from bogs of the inner Gulf Coastal Plain; faunal assemblages (particularly
microfaunal assemblages of Central Texas Caves); carbon and oxygen stable isotope
data from sediments, human and faunal skeletal material and gastropod shell;
geomorphic studies and mathematical models of large scale climate patterns (Abbott
2001: 26-30). Abbott lists potential sources of paleoclimatological data that are
currently not being applied in the region, such as tree ring dating, phytolith and diatom
studies, macrobotanical studies, and aquatic bivalve distributions (Abbott 2001: 30).
Until the local paleoclimate record becomes more robust the interpretations will continue
to rely heavily on proxy data from adjacent locales.
Pollen records from Central Texas bogs show that the Late Pleistocene Full
Glacial period (16,000-12,000 B.P.) was cool and moist compared to modern climates.
Taxa of cold-tolerant species that in modern environments are associated with mixed
boreal/deciduous forests were recovered, and interpreted to indicate that the inner Gulf
Coastal Plain had a vegetation cover of sheltered cold tolerant species in open prairies as
opposed to full boreal forests (Bryant and Holloway 1985). Faunal assemblages of
extinct megafauna from this period were recovered from an alluvial terrace of Blanco
Creek at the Buckner Ranch site, in Bee County (Sellards 1940). The Late Glacial
period (14,000-12,000 B.P.) was as cool as the previous period, but drier. Clovis
occupations are found from this period across Central Texas and the Southern High

20

Plains (Abbott 2001: 31-32). During this time period sea level was up to 100 m lower
than today, and approximately 200 km further out to sea (Ricklis and Blum 1997).
The Holocene climate is divided into Early (12,000-8,000 B.P.), Middle (8,0004,000 B.P.), and Late (4,000 B.P. to the present). During the Early Holocene there was a
warming and drying trend, though temperatures were cooler than today. Bousman (1998)
interprets the cause of the cooler, drier temperatures to be an influx of glacial meltwater
into the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River between 12,000 B.P. and 10,000 B.P.
This event corresponds to the Clovis archaeological period. The cooling of Gulf of
Mexico water temperatures would have led to less evaporative moisture and
precipitation. During the later part of the Early Holocene the glacial meltwater was
diverted to the Atlantic, causing the Gulf of Mexico to warm. The warmer temperatures
correlate to the Folsom archaeological period, and sea level rapidly raised to only 9
meters below the modern shoreline to approximately 30 km offshore (Blum et al 2002).
A terrestrial shift from arboreal to grassland pollen occurs during this period, which
suggests a change towards prairie-savannah vegetation similar to modern conditions
(Abbott 2001: 32). This transition would have occurred during the Late Paleoindian
period, which is reflected in subsistence, technological, and possibly social changes
during the Paleoindian period. The Middle Holocene is considered warmer and drier
than the previous period, and some researchers see evidence that the conditions would
have been drier than modern conditions (Abbott 2001: 33). Drier conditions would
result in less biomass and probably less expected prey than modern conditions. Sea level
continued to rise, and there is evidence of sea level rising up to 2 meters above modern

21

conditions at approximately. Sea level lowered after this point to near modern
conditions towards the end of this period (Blum et al 2002). Middle Holocene correlates
to the Early and Middle Archaic archaeological periods, during which it is expected to
see greater diversity in resource exploitation. The Late Holocene is interpreted to see an
increase in moisture and possibly a decrease in temperature relative to Middle Holocene
conditions (Abbott 2001: 34). Using the modern analog for the Late Holocene it can be
inferred that there was an increase in biomass and prey from the drier Middle Holocene.
This period is known archaeologically as the Late Archaic 4000-1500 B.P. and the Late
Prehistoric 1500 B.P.-to Historic. During this time period food resources should have
increased, and larger game should have become more abundant, which is possibly
evidenced by an increase in bison remains found at archaeological sites (Ricklis 1992).
Archaeological Setting
An abbreviated survey of the archaeological record of the Central Gulf Coastal
Plain of Texas is presented below. See Hester 2004, Ricklis 2004a, 2004b for a more
comprehensive synthesis of the archaeological research of the region (Figure 7).

22

Figure 7. Regional archaeological chronology and diagnostic artifacts (based on Collins
2004, Hester 2004, Ricklis 2004a)

23

There are very limited data on Early Paleoindian period (12,000 to 10,000 B.P.)
and limited data on the Late Paleoindian Period (10,000 to 8,000 B.P.) for the Central
Gulf Coastal Plain compared to other regions of the state. Clovis and Folsom artifacts
have only been recovered from sites of limited integrity, which include the Buckner
Ranch (41BE2) paleontological site in Bee County, and Clovis artifacts and Pleistocene
fauna washing ashore on McFaddin Beach (41JF50) (Sellards 1940, Hester et al 1992).
Late Paleoindian points such as Golondrina and Angostura have been found with greater
frequency and some have been excavated in situ. Examples are Buckeye Knoll
(41VT98), the Johnston-Heller site (41VT14), and the McNeill- Gonzales site (41VT141)
(Ricklis and Doran 2003, Birmingham and Hester 1976, Taylor 2005). Berger Bluff
(41GD30) is a site that will be discussed later due to its proximity and similar
geomorphic context to the McNeill- Gonzales site. It has a radiocarbon dated Late
Paleoindian component with evidence of local faunal remains of riparian and upland
taxa (Brown 1996).
The lack of Early Paleoindian archaeological data in the region is probably due to
the lack of exploration, but also widespread submergence of sites caused by sea level
rise (Ricklis 2004a, Ricklis and Weinstein 2005). Late Paleoindian sites are too few to
allow a regional synthesis. In adjoining regions it appears that the Late Paleoindian
period is characterized by a decrease in interregional mobility for the exploitation of
large megafauna to one that exploited intraregional, local resources (Bousman et al
2004).

24

By 8,000 B.P. the initial widespread evidence of marine and geophyte food
processing, as well as the cultural development of cemeteries signal the development of
Archaic lifeways. There are few sites from the Early Archaic (8,000-6,000 B.P.),
perhaps because many were inundated during sea level rise in the Early Holocene
(Ricklis 2004a, Ricklis and Blum 1997). The change to a broader diet is seen
archaeologically by the presence of shell middens for processing shellfish (primarily
Rangia) in what would have been coastal environments, and burned rock middens in the
interior plains for processing geophytes. Deer and other medium to small mammals
make up the majority of the faunal assemblages.
Shellfish midden deposits from the Early Archaic have been excavated at coastal
sites of Eagle Ridge (41GV53) and McKinzie (Ricklis1988, Ricklis 2004b). These sites
would have been at the edge of the coastal estuaries forming in the inundated river
valleys. These sites are much smaller than later shellfish middens, and are typically
small scatters of shell and faunal material which could either represent small short term,
logistical foray sites of an intensified population, or conversely are longer term
occupational remains of a society with lower population densities (Ricklis 2004a). There
have been few well-excavated Central Gulf Coastal Plain sites not immediately on the
coast with Early Archaic components. The only interior sites suitable for comparison
are at the extreme western margin of the Coastal Plain near the Balcones Escarpment.
Burned rock middens at the Wilson Leonard site and the Richard Beene site provide
examples of intensified exploitation of floral resources during the Early Archaic (Collins
1998, Thoms 2004).

25

One of the earliest cemeteries in North America, the Buckeye Knoll site, is
located on the Coastal Prairie, and it suggests intensive local occupation during the Early
Archaic period. Isotopic values of skeletal material indicate a mixed diet of both coastal
and interior resources, which in turn indicates that during the Early Archaic mobility was
not restricted as to prohibit movement from the coastal zones into the interior, but that
local populations of the Early Archaic probably lived exclusively within the Coastal
Plain (Ricklis and Doran 2003).
During the Middle Archaic (6,000-2,500 B.P.) the Archaic lifeways continued
but with an increase in the number and size of inland sites on the northern portions of the
upper Texas coast. This suggests increasing populations to the north, however in the
central and southern Coastal Plains there appear to be fewer coastal sites. This may be a
function of sea level rise reducing the productivity of central and southern Coastal Plain
nearshore environments (Ricklis 2004a, Ricklis 2004b). Sites further inland suggest
larger interior populations, as evidenced by large cemetery sites such as the Loma
Sandia site, and a compone nt of the Ernest Witte site (Taylor and Highley 1995, Ricklis
2004b).
The Late Archaic (2,500-1,500 B.P.) saw further signs of local intensification
and reduced mobility with poorer quality, local lithic resources being more frequently
used, increased numbers and sizes of coastal archaeological sites with thicker and larger
shell midden components, and larger cemeteries. This increase in sites corresponds with
the stabilizing of sea level and formation of productive estuary environments that appear
to have been absent or submerged during the Middle Archaic. An example of resource

26

intensification is an increase in coastal fishing, as evidenced by an exponential increase
in fish remains recovered archaeologically along the Nueces and Corpus Christi Bays
(Ricklis 2004a). Large Late Archaic cemeteries are found in a component of the Ernest
Witte site, the Morhiss site, and the Blue Bayou site (Ricklis 2004a). Other data that
suggests decreased mobility due to population pressures, include stable isotope ratios of
human skelatons at the Blue Bayou site that show primarily non- marine resources
dominating the diet at a site less than 20 kilometers from the coastline (Ricklis 2004a).
This site is approximately as far inland as the Buckeye Knoll site, which suggests
reduced mobility from mixed shoreline and interior diets during the Early Archaic to a
more restricted diet and mobility pattern by the Late Archaic. Estuarine resources along
the recently stabilized shoreline were heavily exploited during the Late Archaic.
Facilitated by a greater number of well excavated sites with large artifact assemblages,
Ricklis (1996) proposed there is enough evidence from the Late Archaic to postulate a
seasonal adaptive pattern of exploiting estuarine resources in the fall and winter, and
then moving to the immediately adjacent interior upland prairie environments during the
spring and summer. This pattern seems to continue into the Late Prehistoric, and
corresponds to the ethnohistorical record of the Karankawa (Ricklis 1996).
In comparison to the Archaic, the Late Prehistoric (1,500 B.P. to 400 B.P.) saw
the incorporation of ceramic and bow and arrow technology, and an ever- increasing
intensification of land use, with some new resources. The Late Prehistoric Period is
characterized by Rockport Phase Ceramics. The Rockport Phase material culture
consists of bone tempered, asphaltum decorated ceramics, hunting with the bow and

27

arrow, and large sites with intensive marine exploitation. Bison becomes present on the
Coastal Plain during the Late Prehistoric. Toyah Phase material culture from the Plains
enters the interior of the Central Coastal Plain, though it is debated whether this is due to
a migration of bison hunters into the region, or if it is an introduction of material culture
associated with bison hunting (Ricklis 1992). Although there is archaeological evidence
that people with coastal material culture hunted bison in the interior at the Melon site
(41RF21), the ethnohistorical record of Cabeza de Vaca suggests it was not a regular
occurrence (Ricklis 1996: 97, Kreiger 2002). Seasonal rounds of historically observed
aboriginals of the region are hypothesized to have begun in the Late Archaic and
continue through the Late Prehistoric, with population densities equivalent to
ethnohistorical estimates.
Researchers are fortunate to have ethnohistorical evidence documenting
indigenous populations of the Gulf Coastal Plain. It is a rich history since the earliest
imperial Spanish and French explorations of Texas occurred on the coastal plain. The
Western Gulf Coastal Plain was home to the historically documented Karankawa
Indians, who lived along the Central Coast between the Colorado and the Nueces Rivers.
The most comprehensive analysis of Karankawa culture is by Ricklis (1996). Ricklis
develops a cultural ecology of the Karankawa that interprets seasonal exploitation of
coastal and inland plant and animal resources within a 40 km of the coastline by
synthesizing historical documents and the archaeological record. Fall and winter were
spent on the coast exploiting the near-shore marine resources of bays and estuaries. The
spring and summer saw a transition to inland resources, such as men hunting large

28

mammals and women gathering floral materials such as seeds, fr uits like prickly pear
tunas and edible greens (Ricklis 1996: 23). The McNeill-Gonzales site is located
approximately 30 km inland from the Karankawa territory, so the site area was probably
a border area between the Karankawa and inland cultures. The Coahuiltecan are a
poorly defined interior cultural group that consisted of numerous bands and small tribes.
These tribes and small bands would have been located in the area of the McNeillGonzales site, but they experienced significant cultural upheaval during the historic
period, and only a few sources, primarily Cabeza de Vaca, are considered representative
of the inhabitants of the interior Coastal Plain. These groups had diverse land use
patterns that exploited the full spectrum of possible food resources; that in comparison to
the coastal environments were limited. Opunita fields, mesquite peas, roots, and
occasional small game and amphibians, deer, as well as occasion bison seem to have
made up the diet of interior inhabitants (Nunez 1993: 62-63).
Historically the area of the McNeill- Gonzales site has seen settlement by
Spanish, Mexican, and Anglo-Northern Europeans. The Spanish transferred Mission
Espiritu Santo de Zuniga from a location in modern Victoria, TX to a site on the west
banks and terraces of the Guadalupe River immediately to the west of the McNeillGonzales site. The mission existed at this location from 1726 to 1747 and served local
Coahuiltecan tribes called the Aranama and Tamique and some Karankawa who came
inland from the coast (Ricklis 1996, Walter 1999). Ranching, hunting, gathering, and
possibly farming would have occurred near the McNeill- Gonzales site during this time
period. The Gonzales family acquired the property where the McNeill- Gonzales site

29

exists in the mid to late nineteenth century, though they are unsure if it was a land grant
or purchased property (Gonzales n.d.). For at least 125 years descendants of the
Gonzales family have been ranching and farming the property in an area of Victoria
County that has remained primarily agricultural.

30

CHAPTER III
STRATIGRAPHY

The archaeology of the McNeill-Gonzales site is best understood by placing the
site in geologic context. This was accomplished by: studying maps, surface survey,
examinations of exposures created by borrow pit operations, and subsurface testing.
These studies facilitated the creation of a valley cross section (Figure 8, 9). The
characterization of stratigraphic units was made possible by subsurface testing, profile
descriptions, granulometric stud ies, radiocarbon dating, and luminescence dating (Figure
10). The identified stratigraphic units are presented (Figure 11) with descriptions of
each unitâs stratigraphic position, sedimentology, pedology, and chronology (Table 1).
The units are compared to other described localities of similar stratigraphy to place the
landforms of the McNeill- Gonzales site in a regional context. All of the detailed
descriptions of site stratigraphy and lab analyses are found in the appendices.

Beaumont Formation
The Beaumont Formation forms the northeastern margin of the Guadalupe River
valley and rise approximately 5 meters above the Deweyville Terrace. These level
clayey uplands were sampled with a truck mounted core rig (Figure 12). Though the
uplands are mapped as Lissie Formation the cores generally corresponded with the
mapped Lake Charles (Key West), Decosta, and Telferner Soil Series, which are
considered soils of the Beaumont Formation. Core 1 was excavated on the level uplands
of the Beaumont Formation. The profile consisted of a shallow 20 cm plow zone of very

36

Figure 12. Cross section of the Beaumont scarp

dark gray clay, underlain by 80 cm of very dark gray clay. Below these clays to the limit
of core 5 meters below the surface was a brownish yellow to light reddish brown silty
clay to clay with common strong calcic soft masses and nodules.
Cores 2 and 3 had similar profiles on the same upland setting but were near the
edge of the slope. Core 5 is on the convex portion of the gentle scarp of the Beaumont
Formation. This exposure was like the previous exposures, except the clayey sediments
above the underlying calcic horizons were reddish brown silty clay loams. Core 7 was
located on the concave toeslope of the gently sloping escarpment. This core was quite
similar to the profiles of Cores 1-3. Three augers (4, 10-4, and 10-5) located at the

37

surface contact between the sandy deposits atop the Deweyville terrace and the
Beaumont clays all had a sandy loam A horizon of the Holocene eolian sands mantling a
shallow sandy clay loam to sandy clay like the Decosta Series description, but with a
few red mottles of iron redox features. Archaeological site 41VT144 was found in this
thin sandy mantle abruptly overlaying the Decosta Series soil along the edge of the
terrace. The contact between the Deweyville Terrace and the Beaumont upland is quite
abrupt, and augers and cores less than 20 meters away to the south of the contact (Core
7, Auger 10-3) have no evidence of Beaumont soils to the limit of exposure at
approximately 3 meters. The cores and augers on the Beaumont surface show that the
uplands are stable, have not seen severe erosion, and have experienced significant
pedogenic alteration. Beaumont Formation deposits presumably dip below the
Deweyville Terrace, but no augers on the Deweyville Terrace encountered any
Beaumont sediments at depth.
Deweyville Formation
The Deweyville Terrace is an unpaired terrace on the northern margin of the
valley that is 5 meters below the upland Beaumont formation and approximately 7
meters above the modern floodplain. It is between 26-33 meters above sea level,
however portions of the upper 1-2.5 meters of the terrace have an eolian Holocene
component. The area of the terrace is 0.5 km2 . Due to the abrupt contact with the
Beaumont uplands the terrace appears to be erosional, however the lack of deep
exposures of the Deweyville Terrace and few exposures of the contact with the

38

Beaumont Formation do not preclude it being a depositional terrace with limited erosion
at the valley margins.
Sedimentological and Pedogenic Attributes. The Deweyville Formation deposits
form the core of the alluvial terrace, with a mantling of Holocene sands that contain the
archaeological deposits. Exposures that encountered the Deweyville Formation consist
of three pedo/depositional units: a discontinuous buried paleosol here named the
Deweyville Paleosol; light yellowish brown medium sands to gravelly fluvial sands; and
a deeply buried calcic horizon. No exposures were extensive enough to determine
bedding structure of the sands, but the presence of gravel lenses and coarser sands
suggest these are fluvial deposits. Six samples from three exposures of sands were
selected for particle size analysis (Auger 5-9, Paleo Profile Auger, Auger 5-36). The
samples averaged 91.3% sand, are slightly gravelly (1.3%), and weakly alkaline with an
average pH of 8.2. The average of the sand size fraction (0.0625-2.0 mm) for the six
samples is moderately sorted fine skewed medium- fine sand.
Five exposures of the complete paleosol show variability in thickness from 75 cm to 175
cm. The paleosol has been truncated with no associated epipedon, and is laterally
eroded at the edges of the terrace. The upper meter of the paleosol is an argillic dark
gray sandy clay loam to clay loam with distinct common red mottles and a strong coarse
blocky subangular structure. In four exposures (A5-9, A5-29, A5-40, C8) below the
upper argillic portio n of the soil is a lower horizon of dark gray sandy clay loam with
common, distinct calcium carbonate nodules (Figure 13). In one exposure of the
Deweyville Paleosol at the central portion of the terrace there is no calcic horizon, but

39

Figure 13. Comparisons of Deweyville Paleosol exposures

instead strong well-developed wavy clay lamellae that are up to 2 cm thick at 15 cm
intervals that extend 1.4 m into the fluvial deposits (Figure 14). Particle size
distributions for two samples of the Deweyville Paleosol were conducted (Excavation
Area 4-Sample D9692, A5-9). The average particle size distribution of the two samples
are 60.6% sand, and is classified as an extremely poorly sorted strongly fine skewed
medium silt. The upper portion of the paleosol is acidic, with an average pH of 5.8. The
red mottles are iron redox features that indicate seasonal wetting and drying. Water
flows through the mantle of well-drained fine sands until it reaches the impediment of
the buried paleosol. The active process of cyclical wetting and drying is probably
causing the redox features, which considering the lower calcic horizon indicates a
polygentic nature to the deposit. The thickness, well-developed redox features, calcic
horizon, and age of the sandy parent materia l indicate it is a buried paleosol and not a
soil formed solely from illuvial processes during the Holocene.

The calcic portion of the Deweyville Paleosol that underlies the redox mottled
sandy clay loam derives its calcic character from the accumulation of secondary
carbonate. This has resulted in the formation of a Stage II calcic horizon with common
nodules and soft masses (Birkeland 1999: 357). The standard model of carbonate
formation (Birkeland 1999) would interpret that in this setting the intermittent saturation
of sediments from water that flows through the mottled sandy clay loam was not
sufficient to leach carbonates out, and they have accumulated below the mottled sandy
clay as nodules and soft masses. The processes of calcification in the Gulf Coastal Plain
has come into question by James Abbott, who contends that carbonate horizons found in
this region do not allow the typical interpretations of climate and carbonate formation

41

chronology. In this region carbonate horizons are typically found in the saturated
phreatic zones as opposed to the vadose zone (Abbott 2001: Appendix II). The standard
model of carbonate formation was developed in studies of carbonates in the only
seasonally wetted vadose zone. Considering that in this context the upper clay horizon
has led to the formation of a perched water table the carbonate development of the
Deweyville Paleosol may not be accounted for in standard interpretations of carbonate
formation. Unfortunately compared to the vadose models there have been little work on
phreatic carbonates of humid regions, and little acknowledgement of this form of
carbonate development in the United States (Abbott 2001).
The Deweyville Paleosol is not uniformly present across the Deweyville Terrace,
particularly on the margins of the terrace where it has been eroded and colluvium and
eolian sediments are unconformably resting on the fluvial sands of the Deweyville
Formation. The relationship between the sandy mantle and the underlying Deweyville
Formation will be discussed in detail in the section on Holocene deposits.
A final feature of the Deweyville Terrace is a deep calcic horizon located below
the bedded fluvial sands. A strong, cemented gravelly to silty calcic horizon was only
encountered on the southeastern portion of the terrace. The calcic horizon was
encountered in Auger 1, Auger 2, Auger 5, the Paleo Area Excavation, Auger 10-6, and
Auger 10-7. The thickness of the horizon was only exposed in a borrow pit cut near at
the southeastern margin of the terrace (Figure 15). Here the calcic horizon is
discontinuous with a thickness ranging from 40 to 80 centimeters, and is unconformably
overlain by Holocene deposits with archaeological material. Fluvial deposits with small

42

Figure 15. Exposure of deep calcic horizon in Deweyville Formation

boulder sized gravels underlie the calcic horizon, and though the horizon is primarily
formed in silty sediments, portions of the calcic horizon have formed in the gravelly
deposits. Only the auger furthest upslope (Auger 1) has an exposure of the calcic
horizon buried deeply under fluvial sands of the Deweyville Terrace.
Chronometric Evidence. OSL sample #1 was collected from the fluvial sands
below the Deweyville Paleosol in a deep exposure created by the borrow excavations
(Figure 14).

The sample was collected from medium sands between well-developed

lamellae, 115 cm below the top of the buried paleosol. Methods outlined by Jain et al
(2003) for the analysis of multiple aliquots were used after single aliquot sample did not
produce a finite age. Multiple aliquots were analyzed by three excitation methods, blue
light, green light, and infrared. Of these three methods only the green light stimulation

43

of quartz minerals produced a finite age. Blue light produced an estimation of >26,700
+ 1900 yr (UIC1690BL), while infrared excitation of Feldspars produced an estimation
of >50,400 + 3200 yr (UIC1690IR). The green light stimulation produced a finite age
of 63,100 + 4000 yr (UIC1690GR), which gives age estimation at the 2-sigma age range
of 55,100-71,100 yr. Corroborating evidence of this age is the complete lack of
prehistoric artifacts in any exposures or subsurface tests below the paleosol, and the
similar ages reported by other researchers.
Correlations to Other research. The deposits of this terrace correlate to other
descriptions of Deweyville Formation deposits, and in particular descriptions of deposits
labeled âHigh Deweyvilleâ. The Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98) has a similar
stratigraphy. Fine well-sorted sands with archaeological deposits overlie a buried
truncated paleosol (Frederick and Bateman 2004). Like the McNeill-Gonzales site there
were instances where the upper mantling sands were resting directly on the underlying
fluvial deposits of the Deweyville Formation. They were able to date the deposits by
OSL, and conduct granulometric analyses of the lower fluvial sands and buried paleosol.
In their samples they were not able to discern any textual difference between the
underlying sands and the sandy mantle, but a series of OSL dates identified a clear
difference in age between the deposits. The underlying deposits all dated between 49
and 53 ka while the upper deposits were Holocene in age (Frederick and Bateman 2004:
10).
In a geomorphic study of the Nueces River Durbin (1999) recorded numerous
Deweyville Terraces he described as Holocene sandy A-E soil horizons mantling a

44

buried paleosol with red mottling and calcic nodules, and underlying bedded fluvial
deposits. Although he did not date the upper sands, and did not address the depositional
mechanisms for the upper mantling sands, samples from the lower fluvial deposits
produced the 60-47 ka dates for the âHigh Deweyvilleâ (Durbin 1999, Durbin et al
1997). A geomorphic survey for the proposed Lake Creek Reservoir in Montgomery
County, Texas recorded numerous instances of eolian sands mantling Deweyville
terraces (Mandel 1987). Mandel recorded profiles that conformed to the A-E sandy
mantle with a buried paleosol with red mottles, though he was not able to directly date
the Deweyville terraces or the mantling sands. Finally, in a geoarchaeological model of
the distribution of archaeological sites in the Houston area, Abbott (2001: 99) identifies
deposits on the San Jacinto River where sand sheets overlie a truncated Pleistocene soil
on Deweyville Terraces.
Infilled Channel, Possibly Low Deweyville
Along the southern and eastern margins of the Deweyville Terrace there is
evidence for a buried paleochannel inset into the High Deweyville Terrace and partially
buried by later Holocene colluvium and sandy mantle. This feature is present along a
low table of sediments that exists at the margin of the terrace before its steep scarp onto
the Holocene floodplain. The buried, infilled channel was encountered in Augers 5-5, 56, near the burial area, Auger 5-28 near the Anaqua Mott Area and backhoe trenches 2
and 3 on the far southeastern edge of the terrace. The sediments of Augers 5-5 and 5-6
consisted of dark grayish brown weakly calcic silty clay that was relatively uniform to
the maximum depth of the augers. Backhoe trenches 2 and 3 had clay to sandy loam

45

sediments with only minimal carbonate filaments. The facies relationship between these
deposits, the Deweyville Formation deposits, and the Holocene colluvium and sandy
mantle is quite abrupt, with completely different profiles existing within 5 to 10 meters
of the silty clay to sandy-clayey loam sediments. Auger 5-6 and Trench 3 were attempts
to identify a southern facies relationship with the other side of the channel, but it appears
this facies is completely eroded away.
Holocene Deposits
The Holocene deposits are located on the terrace tread, the slopes of the terrace,
and the Holocene floodplain. The deposits mantling the Deweyville Terrace are
sediments deposited by colluvial and eolian mechanisms that have since undergone postdepositional processes such as pedogenesis, erosion, and bioturbation. This has created
a complex stratigraphy that required extensive subsurface testing to correlate
stratigraphic units across the terrace. These correlations are in a general project area
cross section (Figure 11), and a series of cross sections that encounter archaeological
deposits at the edge of the terrace (Figures 16, 17, 18, 19). There are three stratigraphic
units identified on the Deweyville Terrace. The Holocene deposits of the floodplain were
only minimally examined because investigations focused on the archaeological deposits.
Many localities with Holocene deposits are found where erosion of the Deweyville
Terrace created depressions and steep grades that then became filled with sediments
during the Holocene. Localized erosion is evident from instances of the truncation of the
Deweyville Paleosol, the complete removal of the argillic portion of the Deweyville
Paleosol leaving only the calcic horizon, and examples of Holocene sands

46

unconformably resting on sands of the Deweyville Formation. The most dramatic
examples of erosion are where the buried Deweyville Paleosol has been completely
eroded down to the fluvial deposits or the deep buried calcic horizon. Subsequent
alluvial and colluvial deposits rest unconformably on these eroded surfaces. Evidence
for erosion was found primarily along the margins of the terrace, however an ancient
gully or depression was identified at the southern portion of the central part of the
terrace. Here profiles created by borrow pit operations and auger 5-22 found no
evidence of the Deweyville Paleosol and the fine sands of the Holocene deposits are
unconformably above coarser fluvial deposits. Augers and profiles approximately 30 m
to the east and west of auger 5-22 have evidence of the paleosol. Due to the localized
nature of this erosion it may represent a gully that eroded only a portion of the terrace,
and then infilled during the Holocene with colluvium and eolian sediments.
In other locations on the south and east portions of the terrace the argillic portion
of the Deweyville Paleosol has been eroded to expose the underlying calcic component
of the paleosol. This erosion was widespread across these portions of the terrace, which
suggests a larger scale erosion event like scouring by fluvial processes. These calcic
soils were then exposed to the surface during early portions of the Holocene, and were
prehistoric living surfaces. Later Holocene deposits then mantled these portions of the
terrace; however the deposits are not nearly as thick as the sandy deposits that filled the
gully in the central portion of the terrace.

Evidence of the buried Deweyville Paleosol being truncated comes from the lack
of an epipedon in augers, profiles, and cores. A deep pit on the terrace has an extensive
lateral profile of the contact between the paleosol and Holocene deposits. The contact is
abrupt and irregular with no evidence of an illuvial Bt horizon welded to the buried
paleosol. Because the paleosol is actively experiencing illuviation and gleying in some
locations it was impossible to discern the topography of the upper portion of the buried
paleosol in these locations. The mechanism for the truncation of the paleosol and its
epipedon is unknown, but eolian deflation or water erosion by gullying of the epipedon
could have stripped upper horizons leaving the endopedon susceptible to further
localized erosion.
The first period of Holocene deposits (Ia) are relatively thin sand deposits that
began filling depressions along the southern scarp; and exposed calcic portions of the
Deweyville Paleosol reworked as colluvium along the southeastern scarp edge. This unit
was identified atop the buried Deweyville paleosol in the central portion of the site and
at the southeastern portion of the terrace in the reworked calcic colluvium. Much of this
depositional unit has undergone pedogenesis with clay illuviation. The next Holocene
deposit (Ib) is a sand deposit of varying thickness that continued to fill low-lying
portions of the terrace scarp. This deposit is more uniform across the terrace scarp,
slope, and it may mantle the terrace tread. The deposits have a weak but distinct
paleosol, which is found across the entire scarp and slope of the southern portion of the
terrace. The final period of Holocene deposition on the terrace tread and slope (Ic) is a
sandy deposit that forms the modern surface. These deposits are mollic with a darkened

52

A horizon along the terrace edge that loses its dark color upslope on the terrace tread.
On the terrace tread up to the edge of the terrace scarp these deposits have a weak albic
endopedon with distinct clay lamellae. The southeastern portion of the terrace has only a
thin mantling of Ic deposits and no endopedon. The Holocene floodplain deposits (II)
were not systematically studied, however it was observed that the floodplain deposits
along the terrace edge are fine overbank deposits.
Sedimentological and Pedogenic Attributes. The Holocene deposits have many
similarities: the obliteration of primary bedding structure by biological and pedological
processes; the sediments are uniform fine sands, and the deposits of the terrace edge are
much darker in color than the sediments further upslope. The lack of bedding structure is
evidenced in excavation unit profiles and exposures across the site. Bioturbation as
evidenced by modern roots, infilled root casts, ant hills, insect tunnels, and human
activities have led to the destruction of bedding structures, however the primary form of
disturbance is due to the activity of gophers. Gopher mounds are quite common across
the terrace (Figure 20). The building of gopher mounds was primarily observed
occurring in the early spring when vegetation is at its lowest, and potentially a large
volume of sediment is moved. This has caused a homogenization of the deposits and
translocation of artifacts, which hinders the interpretation of depositional processes and
integrity of the archaeological deposits. Though there is variability in burrow depths, it
is reported that gophers typically do not burrow deeper than 60 cm (Johnson 1989), so
the disturbance by gophers should be limited to the upper portions of each Holocene
depositional unit. The impact of bioturbation on the archaeological stratigraphy and

53

Figure 20. Photo of gopher mounds

integrity of the deposits will be discussed in the next chapter as well, but it should be
said here that there is evidence for burial by sedimentation and not predominately by
biomantle formation.
The evidence for burial by sedimentation comes from the preservation of intact
archaeological features and human burials; diagnostic artifacts that were found in a
stratigraphically consistent manner with the regional chronology; and a physiographic
position on a slope that would be subject to primarily aggradational processes. Features
consistent with pedogenesis and artifact redistribution by biomantling were relatively
limited in the Holocene deposits on the terrace surface, with only limited evidence of

54

artifact translocation to the base of the deposits to form stone lines as defined by Johnson
(2002), or the wholesale mixing of diagnostic artifacts.
Holocene Unit Ia. Holocene Unit Ia is located immediately above the variously
eroded Deweyville Formation deposits along the southern edge of the terrace and has
varying degrees of pedogenic alternation. In excavation unit exposures on the terrace
tread the unit is aggradational, has seen weak clay illuviation, and the partial obliteration
of a weak paleosol at the top of the unit. The remnant A horizon is a 10 cm thick dark
grayish brown loamy fine sand, with evidence of infilled root casts below the A horizon.
The underlying illuvial horizon is 45 cm thick and texturally a sandy loam to sandy clay
loam. This aggradational portion of Unit Ia is weakly acidic (pH 6.2) and has a similar
particle size frequency clustered around fine sands like subsequent sand deposits of the
Holocene. It is assumed this unit exists at the base of the infilled gully on the
southwestern portion of the terrace, though this was not identified in Auger 5-22.
Unit Ia as identified on the southeastern portion of the terrace consists of
sediments from the truncated Deweyville Paleosol that was reworked during the
Holocene as colluvial slopewash. Along this portion of the terrace the argillic portion of
the Deweyville Paleosol was truncated, exposing underlying sandy calcic horizon. The
edge of the terrace was laterally eroded, creating a relatively steeper grade. Portions of
the exposed calcic horizon were mobilized and locally redeposited downslope. These
sediments retained the calcic nodules that developed when the unit was overlain by the
argillic horizon of the Deweyville Paleosol, which is still preserved further upslope. The
deposits are approximately 50 cm thick loamy fine sands that have experienced clay

55

illuviation from Unit Ib. They are weakly alkaline (pH 8.2) like the calcic deposits and
sands of the underlying deposits of the Deweyville Formation.
Holocene Unit Ib. Unit Ib is found across the southern edge of the Deweyville
Terrace and possibly on portions of the terrace tread. In all locations along the scarp the
deposit is aggradational in low portions with a paleosol developed at the top of the
deposit. The deposits are thickest on the central and western edges of the terrace, where
it filled the paleo-gully and mantled Unit Ia with a dark gray fine sand. The deposits are
approximately 75 cm thick and are texturally similar to the aggradational deposits of Ia
in this portion of the site. The paleosol is manifested by an abrupt change in soil
structure from the structureless massive sands of Unit Ic to a weak coarse blocky
subangular structure. On the southeastern portion of the site Unit Ib is a 40 to 60 cm
mantle of dark grayish brown fine sandy loam. This deposit lies directly on the
reworked colluvium of Unit Ia and is found across the southeast portion of the terrace.
During a period of stability this deposit developed into a paleosol with medium weak
blocky angular structure.
The unit may be present on the terrace tread, but unfortunately this is hard to
determine without chronological control on the terrace tread. The paleosol loses its
structure in exposures upslope of the scarp edge, making direct correlation difficult. One
possibility for correlation is that the upper Unit Ic unit has an albic horizon with clay
lamellae that does not extend to the depth of Unit Ib in exposures at the scarp edge
where the paleosol is extant. If the pedogenic process of clay lamellae formation is

56

uniform between the scarp edge and the terrace tread than it suggests that the sands
below the depth of clay lamellae can be at least no younger than unit Ic.
Holocene Unit Ic. The final depositional unit of the terrace is Unit Ic. The
uniformity of the deposit, the texture, and its position on the landscape gives it the
greatest likelihood to be entirely eolian. As opposed to the two lower units that fill low
portions along the edges of the terrace scarp this deposit is of uniform thickness across
much of the terrace. The surface of the unit on the terrace tread is nearly level with a
slightly irregular dome like topography (Figure 21). There are approximately 5 to 8 low
domes no more than 50 cm high and approximately 40 m in diameter across the surface
of the Deweyville Terrace. The stratigraphy of the deposit on the terrace tread consists
of A1-A2 soil horizons of brown fine sands approximately 85 cm thick, underlaid by a
90 cm elluvial E horizon of brown loamy fine sand with clay lamellae for a total
thickness of 175 cm. The lamellae are approximately 5 mm thick, bedded roughly
horizontal, and are spaced approximately 10 cm apart (Figure 22). Below the E horizon
is either a C-horizon of massive fine to medium sands or an abrupt contact with the
Deweyville Paleosol. As the deposit nears the edge of the scarp the sediments become a
very dark grayish brown and the clay lamellae become less pronounced. The sediments
on the slope of the scarp lack clay lamellae, and across portions of the scarp a midden of
prehistoric cultural debris formed. The deposit of the Ic on the slope of the scarp is
thickest at the central portion of the scarp forming one of the low dome-shaped mounds,
and is thinnest on the southeastern portion where it is just a thin mantle approximately

57

Figure 21. Photo of Deweyville Terrace tread

Figure 22. Photo of clay lamellae in Holocene Unit Ic

58

30 cm thick. The sediments are over 90% sand, with just over 60% of the sand fraction
being fine sand. The sand fraction is moderately sorted and coarse skewed. All of the
exposures have examples of bioturbation in the form of insect and rodent burrows, as
well as floralturbation from roots.
Holocene Unit II. Holocene Unit II consists of the floodplain deposits of the
Guadalupe River. These deposits were not studied because this investigation focused on
the deposits of the Deweyville Terrace. The sediments of the floodplain are primarily
overbank deposits that are dark gray silty clays to silty loams. The deposits of the
floodplain near the base of the Deweyville terrace deposits have no similarities to the
Holocene deposits mantling the terrace, which suggest very different inherited properties
of the deposits, and that there is relatively little erosion of the sandy deposits from the
terrace onto the floodplain. No subsurface excavations were conducted on the
floodplain, so the geometry of the deposits or the potential for buried terraces younger
than the Deweyville Terrace is unknown.
Chronometric Evidence. The chronometric data for the Holocene deposits comes
from archaeological artifacts, radiocarbon dating of human burials, and OSL dating of
sediments provide direct dates for the Holocene deposits. No effort was made to date
Unit II.
Unit Ia is dated by diagnostic artifacts and an OSL date. Diagnostic artifacts date
the Ia deposits on the south-central portion of the terrace, while an OSL date and
diagnostic artifacts date the more complicated mixed deposits of Ia on the southeastern
portion of the terrace. OSL Sample #2 is from the sandy colluvium of the reworked

59

Deweyville Paleosol on the southeastern portion of the terrace. The sample was
collected from 1.6 m below ground surface. Though most of the cultural material of this
unit is found above the sample there are scattered artifacts at the level of the sample and
deeper in the profile. Like OSL Sample #1 the single aliquot method was not successful
in producing a finite age. Instead multiple aliquots with infrared and green light
excitation were used to date the sample. Both excitation methods produced finite ages.
Infrared excitation of Feldspars produced an age of 25,800 + 1630 yr (UIC1691IR),
while green light excitation of quartz minerals produced an age of 23,700 + 1495 yr
(UIC1691GR). The two-sigma age ranges overlap with these samp les, being 24,20027,400 yr and 22,500-25,200 yr. These ages are much older than the earliest dated
archaeological components in the region, and probably reflect the limitations of the
aliquot method of OSL dating in depositional settings that have the potential for poor
bleaching. In this colluvial setting not all of the sands may have been bleached during
deposition, which would lead to poorly bleached or unbleached Deweyville sands being
mixed with sands that were bleached later in time during the colluvial process. This
would lead to a mixed value that would average paleodose rate between the age of the
Deweyville sediments 55,000-71,000 yr and Holocene deposits at approximately 10,000
yr. Bioturbation could be another factor with the contribution of younger sediments into
the older deposits. Considering these results future dating should apply the single grain
OSL dating method, which has been shown to successfully identify sediment ages in
poorly bleached, or mixed signature deposits (Bateman et al 2003).

60

The diagnostic artifacts are probably more reliable indicators of the age of Unit
Ia. On the southeastern portion of the terrace the artifacts are primarily in the upper
portion of the colluvial Ia unit with only scattered artifacts deeper in the colluvium
where OSL Sample #2 was collected. On the south-central portion of the terrace unit Ia
consists of aggrading deposits filling depressions atop the Deweyville Paleosol on the
edge of the terrace tread. Diagnostic artifacts of the Late Paleoindian to the Early
Archaic are found in Unit Ia. These artifacts date from between 10,000 to 7,500 B.P.,
and have some degree of stratigraphic separation during this 2,500-year period.
Diagnostic artifacts from the Late Paleoindian period found in this unit were Plainview,
Golondrina, Big Sandy, St. Maryâs Hall, and Angostura. The Plainview and Golondrina
were found towards the bottom of this unit, which suggest the initiation of occupation
and deposition at approximately 10,000 B.P. The Early Archaic diagnostics were found
higher in the profile, though Golondrina points were commonly found intermingled with
these younger diagnostic artifacts. Early Archaic artifacts, which consisted of Gower,
Abasolo, Uvalde, and Lerma dart points were typically in the upper portion of the
deposit, and commonly mixed with the Late Paleoindian artifacts. These data indicate
that the Ia deposits on the terrace tread experienced relatively slow aggradation deposit,
which at its thickest is only 50 cm. The weak paleosol at the surface indicates that this
unit had a period of stability and non-aggradation. The expression of Unit Ia on the
southeastern portion of the scarp is more complicated because it is the result of colluvial
action. Due to lateral movement incurred by colluvial processes the deposits should be
time transgressive, with older deposits upslope and younger deposits downslope,

61

however this could not be tested because systematic excavations in Unit Ia only occurred
in one locality on the southeastern portion of the terrace.
Diagnostic artifacts and the radiocarbon date of a prehistoric burial provide a
chronology of Unit Ib. The unit dates from the Early Archaic to slightly after the Middle
Archaic, which spans from 7,500 to 2,500 B.P. This long period of deposition is
represented at the site by fewer diagnostic artifacts than Unit Ia or Ic. Diagnostic
artifacts recovered were Pedernales, Refugio, Tortuga, Pandora, and a Bell- like dart
point. The Early Archaic artifacts were found in the lower portion of this approximately
60 cm thick deposit that suggests aggradation began around 7,500 B.P. A date from the
top of this depositional unit comes from a burial in the southeastern portion of the
terrace. The researcher analyzing the burial has not published the date, so to not publish
the date before the researcher has an opportunity to the date is presented without the
standard deviation age range. Bone collagen from the burial dated by AMS to 3,650 14 C
yr B.P. (Rice personal communication 2006). This burial appears to be excavated into
older Ib deposits, though there were no older diagnostics near the burial to corroborate
this. A paleosol developed in the upper portions of this unit, and the paucity of Middle
Archaic artifacts and the absence of any artifacts from the earliest part of the Late
Archaic suggest that this deposit stopped aggrading and was stable until 2,500 B.P.
During the Late Archaic burials were excavated into this unit, which has further
complicates the understanding of this unit.
Diagnostic artifacts, radiocarbon dating of two burials, and rates of pedogenesis
date Unit Ic. Numerous diagnostic artifacts date this deposit to the Late Archaic, Late

62

Prehistoric and Historic periods. This unit, which is up to 1 m thick, was aggradational
through this entire period, and there seems that there was no depositional hiatus between
these archaeology periods. Late Archaic artifacts are found at the base of the deposit,
and one burial from this period is excavated into the lower Ib unit. The bone collagen
from two burials was dated. The burial excavated into Unit Ib was dated by AMS to
1730+40 14C yr B.P., while the other located at the base of Unit Ic dated to 2020+ 40 14 C
yr B.P. (Taylor 2005:23). Diagnostic Late Archaic artifacts recovered were Marcos,
Fairland, Ensor, Darl, Catan, Matamoros dart points, and a Friday biface. This in
conjunction with the burials dates the Late Archaic component from 2000 to 1000 B.P.
The Late Prehistoric artifacts consist of Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points, and these are
typically found in the upper portions of the unit, mixed with later historic aboriginal and
European artifacts. European ceramics were found to a depth of 60 cm, which suggests
the upper portion of this unit is mixed through bioturbation. The formation of clay
lamellae is another indicator of age that in this setting helps correlate depositional units
across the terrace. Though the rate of lamellae formation is varied and relative to locale
conditions it is widely accepted that lamellae increase in thickness and frequency with
time (Holliday and Rawlings 2006, Rawlings 2000). Clay lamellae are found in Ic
deposits on the scarp edge in the central portion of the terrace, and in exposures on the
terrace tread. The lamellae formation is comparable between these exposures, which
indicates that deposits on the terrace tread could be Ic, and therefore is no older than
2000 B.P.

Depositional Origin of Holocene Sands. It has been hypothesized that the sands
of the Holocene depositional units are eolian in origin. This is based on observations of
a distinct textural difference between the underlying gravel deposits and the fine sands of
the upper deposits, the sandy mantle topography of the Deweyville Terrace surface, and
the Holocene artifacts recovered in stratigraphic context at the edge of the scarp of the
McNeill-Gonzales site. Extensive field observations, particle size distribution studies,
and radiometric dating tested this hypothesis. The results of the studies cannot entirely
confirm that the sediments are eolian in origin, but it seems likely that they are. First
there is a significant age differences between the Deweyville Formation deposits and the
mantling sands. The OSL date of 63,100 + 4000 yr (UIC1690GR), with a 2-sigma age
range of 55,100-71,100 yr for the gravelly sands underlying the Deweyville Paleosol and
the Holocene age cultural artifacts found above the Paleosol establishes that the Paleosol
is a buried soil that formed, at least in part, on the ancient terrace surface. Therefore the
sands that mantle the paleosol are required to be depositional and are not ancient
Deweyville Formation deposits that have remained in place since the Pleistocene.
The sediment particle size and the very limited chemical study of soil pH suggest
a distinct textual difference between the Deweyville sediments, modern overbank flood
deposits of the Guadalupe River, and the Holocene sands. Determining the mode of
transport by particle size analysis has always been questioned (Tucker and Vacher 1980,
Boggs 2001: 72-74) however one method of determining mode of transport was applied
to this setting. Leigh (2001) compiled a list of grain size attributes of eolian sand (Table
2). Sands from the Holocene sandy mantle, which were two samples from the terrace

64

scarp and one from the terrace tread, modern Guadalupe River overbank deposits, and
the underlying gravelly deposits of the Deweyville terrace are compared to these criteria.
Of the three Holocene sandy mantle samples only the sample from the Sand Pit on the
terrace tread met all the attributes of eolian sand (Table 3). The other two samples met
all of the attributes except they were less than 90% sand. The sample from Excavation
Unit 4 was 86.8% sand while the A horizon of the Paleo Profile was 83% sand. The
average phi size of all the samples was fine sand.
The slightly finer particle size distribution of the samples from the terrace scarp
can possibly be attributed to processes that occurred after initially being deposited by
eolian processes. Colluvial action, increased human and biological activity, as well as
extreme flooding events should be considered as possible sources of fine deposits. One
point that should be made about the sample processing is that none of the samples

processed for particle size distributions were digested with hydrogen peroxide to remove
the organic portion of the samples. The sediments on the terrace scarp and slope are
very dark with suggests a higher organic content than terrace tread deposits. The higher
organic content may derive from prehistoric cultural inputs such as human wastes and
food possessing but more than likely the greater amount of biological activity occurring
at the edge of the terrace over the millennia has contributed to this darker color and
slightly higher clay content. The organics may have added a slight amount of weight to
the fine clay fraction. Another possibility for the slightly higher clay content in one of
the samples could be the addition of clay from flood deposits. During the flood of
record in the late 1990âs the landowner noted that floodwaters came slightly above the
Deweyville terrace scarp on the far southeastern portion of the terrace. The scarp sample
with the highest clay content was taken from this portion of the terrace and extreme but
infrequent flooding could be a possible explanation for the slightly higher clay content.
The particle size distribution of the mantling sands was compared to overbank
deposits of the modern Guadalupe River. Overbank deposits from a recent flooding of

66

the Guadalupe River were collected from the T1 terrace of the deeply incised channel of
the Guadalupe River. Interestingly the overbank deposits met all of Leighâs criteria for
eolian sands. The deposits were 90% sand with a distinct lack of coarse >2 mm and
coarse sand particles. The only distinct difference was that while the sandy mantle
deposits are strongly coarse skewed the Guadalupe River deposits are strongly fine
skewed. Though the average particle size for both deposits are fine sand the Guadalupe
River sample has approximately 3 times the medium sand size fraction than the samples
from the sandy mantle. The Deweyville Terrace deposits fluvial sandy deposits are
distinctly different from the mantling sands, and the Guadalupe River overbank deposits.
They are slightly gravelly (1.3%) moderately sorted fine skewed medium- fine sands.
The gravels preclude an eolian origin for these deposits, which was expected.
These differences are further illustrated by a comparison of the fine to coarse
sand fractions (Figure 23). The silt and clay fractions are not included in this
comparison to negate the potential impact of illuvial clays skewing the frequency curve.
The graph shows that samples from the Holocene sandy mantle are better sorted, finer,
and are uniform in their sand fraction distribution. Samples from the Deweyville sands
and the Guadalupe River overbank deposits are not as well sorted, and are slightly
coarser textured. The similarities between the Deweyville sands and the Guadalupe
River suggest a similar method of deposition, which is most certainly fluvial. The
different curve of the Holocene mantling sands is additional evidence of that the mantle
was deposited by a process other than fluvial.

Though the application of granulometric studies relative to Leighâs criteria
provided ambiguous results the uniformity of the finely skewed fine sand deposits on the
terrace suggests an eolian origin. Granulometric studies were only conducted at a few
localities, but the particle sizes values of these samples largely reflect observations made
at most exposures of the sandy mantle. This large body of uniform fine sands suggests
deposition by an eolian process. Fluvial processes typically have greater variability in
both the vertical and horizontal distribution in particle sizes. There is no fining upward
sequence in mantling sand deposits and no significant differences laterally across the
terrace. These circumstances in conjunction with the evidence presented earlier strongly
suggest an eolian mode of deposition for these sands.

68

An unresolved concern is the sediment source of the mantling sands. There are
four possible sources for the sands: localized eolian reworking of sands from the
Deweyville Terrace that were exposed from below the eroded paleosol; sands
transported from the Beaumont uplands down onto the terrace surface; fluvial sands
from point bars of the Holocene floodplain transported upslope to the Deweyville
Terrace; or sands deposited after long distance transport. The two modes of transport
that can be immediately ruled out are transport from the Beaumont surface, and long
distance transport. If long distance transport were the case much larger areas of the
coastal plain would be covered in sand sheets. The sands that mantle the Deweyville
Terrace are localized, and an examination of the soil series of Victoria County shows a
limited area has sandy soils. The other argument is that the Beaumont surface once had
a veneer of sand that eroded or deflated downslope onto the Deweyville Terrace.
Holocene sand deposits do exist on the Beaumont Formation, but not in this setting.
These deposits are known as the Ingleside Units and are considered relict barrier island
features that are found much closer to the coast. Considering there are no relict sand
features on the adjacent Beaumont uplands, no relict sand pedoturbated down vertic
cracks into the Beaumont soil, and the sand does not mantle down the slope of the
Beaumont onto the Deweyville Terrace there is little evidence that the sands derive from
colluvial and eolian deflation from the Beaumont uplands.
This leaves localized reworking of the Deweyville Terrace sands and the
deflation of Guadalupe River floodplain sand and the subsequent deposition on the
Deweyville Terrace as possible sources of the Holocene eolian sands. There are ample

69

source materials that the Guadalupe River traverses through on the interior Coastal Plain.
Within 50 km upstream there are sandstone deposits of the Quaternary Willis Formation,
Miocene Fleming and Oakville Formation, and there are numerous sandy formations
further upstream (Barnes 1974). These deposits, in addition to sands residing in
Quaternary fluvial terraces present numerous potential sediment sources for the
Deweyville terrace, and for floodplain sands that could be mobilized by eolian
processes. Deriving the sediment sources and depositional mechanisms will most likely
only be resolved with an intensive regional study of multiple localities; however the
applicability of some possible depositional mechanisms should be tested.
The localized reworking of Deweyville Terrace sands could have occurred in two
ways. One mechanism would be if the Deweyville Paleosol were eroded to expose the
underlying fluvial sands. After the exposure the sands could be entrained and
redeposited above the paleosol. Evidence for the erosion of the Deweyville Paleosol
exists along the margins of the terrace and in the paleo- gully on the south-central portion
of the terrace. Situations like these could expose the sands, however considering that
fluvial erosion would probably be necessary to erode the fine textured paleosol one
would have to question if the climate would be arid enough and the surface void of
vegetation to facilitate eolian transport. Another possible source could be the adjacent
valley slope of the Deweyville terrace. Currently the terrace slope is heavily vegetated
by deciduous hardwoods. If the slope wasnât vegetated and the underlying sands of the
Deweyville Terrace were laterally exposed there is the potential that they could be
entrained and redeposited on the surface of the terrace. This seems unlikely because it is

70

hard to envision the large quantity of sand mantling the Deweyville Terrace could have
been redeposited from the slope that seems to be depositing colluvium and sand sheets
through the Holocene.
The deflation of floodplain sands and deposition onto nearby terraces is another
distinct possibility. The Guadalupe River floodplain is not particularly wide at this
portion of the draina ge, and though the active channel is 1.1 km to the south of the
Deweyville Terrace there are numerous examples of paleochannels on the northern
margins of the valley. Channels with braided streams or large point bars located near the
northern edge of the valley would be opportune sediment sources for eolian deflation.
Because the current study did not conduct subsurface investigations on the modern
floodplain the location, much less the age, of channels near the northern margins of the
river valley it is not possible to directly correlate channels to possible depositional
events.

CHAPTER IV
ARCHAEOLOGICAL STRATIGRAPHY

Site Stratigraphy
The site is located on the complex slope and tread of the southern and eastern
sides of a Deweyville terrace. The total site area is approximately 44,500 m2 , however
only approximately 20,000 m2 of the site along the southern slope and tread has
significant archaeological deposits in stratigraphic context. The geoarchaeological
studies focused on four areas in the southern portion of the site (Figure 24). The Main
Site Area is a dome shaped sandy mantle on the tread and crest-slope of the terrace. This
westernmost portion of the site was disturbed by borrow pit operations, which created
numerous exposures. The THC Stewards work on this portion of the site consisted of
salvage excavation of Burial Areas 1 and 2 and Excavation Area 4 and Area 5. A deep
pit with exposures of underlying Deweyville terrace deposits in the Main Site Area was
also examined. The Anaqua Mott Area is on a gentle rectilinear slope both down slope
and to the east of the Main Site Area. This area is disturbed and the THC Stewards
excavated two test units: the Anaqua Mott 1 x2 unit and the Anaqua Mott 2 x2 m unit.
The Paleo Area is located on the southeastern portion of the terrace further down the
gentle rectilinear slope. Here borrow pit excavations created an upslope exposure named
the Paleo Area Profile, and the bottom of the borrow pit exposed prehistoric surfaces.
Two test units were excavated in the Paleo Area, the Paleo Area Excavation unit and the
Paleo Area Burial unit. The final portion of the site examined was the Sand Pit.

72

Figure 24. Excavation area map

73

The sand pit is on the terrace tread in the open level sand fields. There were no
excavations at this portion of the site. Only scattered lithic artifacts were recovered from
exposures, but the borrow pit excavations provided extensive exposures of the upland
sandy mantle of the terrace tread. Very limited subsurface testing has occurred in the
northern and eastern portion of the site, but auger test and exposures in the sand pit
suggests there is limited potential for intact, stratified archaeological deposits.
An important consideration and acknowledgement needs to be made regarding
the archaeological data presented in this section of the thesis. The THC Stewards
conducted the archaeological excavations at the site with their own goals and research
objectives. They allowed me to use their archaeological data for my study. Their test
excavations are completed they have begun to inventory and catalog the excavated
material. There has been no detailed analysis of the artifacts and the designations of
artifact types come only from their field and lab descriptions. Future analyses may show
that diagnostic artifacts should be reclassified, which may impact the interpretations of
the site stratigraphy.
Main Site Area. The burial areas were excavated as salvage excavations, and
therefore unit records are less detailed. Due to the gap in time between the excavation of
the burials and the geoarchaeological investigations Burial Area #2 was not accessible
due to slumping of the unconsolidated walls of the deep pits. Profiles of Burial Area #1,
adjacent borrow pit exposures, and a profile and auger of exposure adjacent to Burial
Area #2 provide an outline of the cultural stratigraphy of this portion of the site. In the
burial areas the fluvial deposits of the Deweyville Formation, as well as Holocene

74

depositional Units Ib and Ic were encountered. There is some evidence for Unit Ia, but it
appears to be mixed with the upper units, eroded, or non-existent.
Burial Area #1 consisted of excavations to a depth of 225 cm below ground
surface (Figure 25). This portion of the Main Site Area was a slight knoll near the scarp
of the Deweyville Terrace before the borrow pit excavations destroyed much of the knoll
feature. The excavation encountered Holocene Unit Ib and Ic, which had an A1-A2E/Bt-2Ab soil sequence. The A1-A2-E/Bt deposit correlates to Holocene Unit Ic while
the 2Ab deposit correlates to Holocene Unit Ib. The upper cumulic A1-A2 horizons are
combined 107 cm thick very dark grayish brown fine sand. Extensive evidence of
bioturbation in the form of infilled rodent burrows exists in these units. Prehistoric lithic
artifacts and one historic ceramic sherd were observed in these horizons. The E/Bt
horizon consists of 50 cm of dark grayish brown fine loamy sand with very dark brown
fine loamy sand lamellae. The lamellae are approximately 1 cm thick, and are found at 5
cm vertical intervals. They are wavy and discontinuous, and provide no evidence of
bedding structure. There is weak medium blocky subangular structure, and fewer
observed rodent burrows. Prehistoric artifacts were found in this level. Below this unit
the 2Ab horizon is very dark grayish brown loamy fine sand, which correlates to
Holocene Unit Ib. The deposit has a weak fine blocky subangular structure and the
exposure is 60 cm thick. Prehistoric lithic artifacts and burned rock were observed in
profile, and Burial #1 was recovered from this horizon. AMS was used to date bone
collagen from this burial to 1730+40 14 C yr B.P. (Taylor 2005:23). Considering that the

75

Figure 25. Burial Area 1 photo and profile

burial age is younger than the paleosol age it is likely that this burial was excavated into
the 2Ab horizon from the upper horizons. The only diagnostic lithic artifact from the
burial area was a Darl point found 50 cm above the burial, which dates to approximately
1,000 B.P., at the transition from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric.
The stratigraphy of Burial Area #2 was not recorded directly because the unit
was too unstable to record. The unit was 2 x 2 m in area and reached a depth of 2.35 m
below surface. A flexed burial was recovered 1.7 m below surface and a bundle burial
was recovered higher in the profile from 1.05 m below the surface. The flexed burial
dated to 2020 + 40 14 C yr B.P. (Taylor 2005: 23). A dart point that conformed to some
of the attributes of the Plainview point was found above the burial, which dates far

76

earlier to the Paleoindian period. In limited observations it was found that burials were
mixed with prehistoric occupational debris. There may be more than one possib le cause
for this mixing. Certainly bioturbation took place in these units as it did across the entire
site, and the process of burying the individual would have disturbed sediments, but
infilling sedimentation of the paleo gully in this location could ha ve contributed to the
mixing of archaeological deposits. These causes may explain why such an early point
form was found above a Late Archaic burial.

Figure 26. Burial Area 2 photo and profile

77

In order to record a representative profile of the area a nearby exposure was
sectioned and described. Auger 5-22 was excavated to a depth of 2.75 m below surface
to provide a more comprehensive exposure (Figure 26). Unfortunately no diagnostic
artifacts were observed in the profile description, but the profile and auger description
provide evidence of significant Late Holocene sedimentation. The profile consists of a
thick cumulic A horizon over a weak 2Ab, underlain by a weak illuvial horizon above
fluvial sands. Holocene Units Ib and Ic, and Deweyville Formation were recorded in
this profile, and had a soil sequence of: Ap-A1-A2-A3-2Ab1-2Ab22-2Bt2-2BC-3C.
Unit Ic was represented by soil sequence Ap-A1-A2-A3. The upper cumulic A horizons
had one historic whiteware sherd and very common prehistoric lithic artifacts and animal
bone. A few burned rocks and possible scattered human bone fragments were observed.
The sediments are generally very dark grayish brown fine sand to fine loamy sand with
very weak fine blocky subangular structure parting to single grain. The upper A
horizons extend from the surface to a depth of 1.85 m. The flexed burial in the nearby
excavation unit was recovered at what would be the base of this upper horizon dates to
2020 + 40 14C yr B.P. (Taylor 2005: 23). This indicates that the Holocene unit Ib with
the soil sequence of 2Ab1-2Ab2-2Bt2-2BC would have begun being deposited before
2000 B.P. The 2Ab1 horizon is approximately 110 cm thick and is identified by its
darker very dark gray color and slightly more developed structure. Prehistoric artifacts
continue in this horizon and considering this horizon is below the horizon that the flexed
burial was found it suggests this paleosol corresponds to Holocene unit Ib. Below 2Ab1
there is a 25 cm thick brown sandy loam 2Ab2 horizon with prehistoric material. Below

78

this horizon a weak argillic horizon of brownish yellow sandy loam to sandy clay loam
was encountered. This horizon does not resemble the Deweyville Paleosol because there
is no gleying, less overall clay content, no underlying calcic horizon, and the structure is
not as strong as the Deweyville Paleosol. It may represent clay illuviation during the
Holocene, as seen in the welded soil at the base of Excavation Area 4. No artifacts were
observed in the auger from this approximately 1 m thick horizon. Below a 50 cm
transitional 2BC horizon were gravelly medium to coarse sands of a 3C that correlate to
other Deweyville Formation fluvial deposits across the site.
The Excavation Area 4 is located at the edge of the terrace tread, on the eastern
side of the Main Site Area. The excavation was 3 x 2 m in area and reached a maximum
depth of 2.35 m below surface. This excavation unit had the most complete record of
the prehistoric occupation at the McNeill- Gonzales site. Diagnostic artifacts spanning
the Late Paleoindian to the Historic Period were recovered from the excavation unit, and
all of the Holocene depositional units and the contact with the Deweyville Paleosol were
identified (Figures 27, 28). The soil sequence for this excavation unit is Ap-A1-AC2Ab-3Ab-3AB-3Bt1-3Bt2-4Bt. Preliminary artifact counts for unit levels by weight;
pollen studies by stratigraphic horizon; and a continuous particle size distribution study
were conducted for this unit. The data from these studies is found in the appendices.
Holocene Unit Ia was found at the base of the excavation unit. It is
approximately 80 cm thick, and is above the Deweyville Paleosol. The only expression
of the paleosol at the top of Ia (3Ab) is in unit N398 E852. The remnant A horizon is a

Figure 27. Excavation Area 4 profile and particle size analysis

79

80

Figure 28. Photo of Excavation Area 4, Unit N397 E850, West Wall

10 cm thick dark grayish brown loamy fine sand. Evidence of bioturbation of this
horizon and the lower horizon (3AB) are vertical root casts 2.5 cm wide, up to 20 cm
long, filled with dark grayish brown sand from above horizon. Other units in Excavation
Area 4 do not have a preserved A horizon, and instead the underlying 3AB horizon is
directly overlain by the subsequent Ib depositional unit. As evidenced by the particle
size distributions there is a textural break below the 3Ab horizon. The clay content

81

increases as an illuvial Bt horizon has formed in the Holocene sediments. This sandy
loam to sandy clay loam is welded with the underlying Deweyville Paleosol (4Bt). The
pollen samples (#3, #7) from this unit had practically no preserved pollen (Appendix D).
The prehistoric cultural material from unit Ia in Excavation Area 4 consists
primarily of lithic artifacts and fire cracked rock. The diagnostic artifacts from
Holocene Unit Ia are Clear Fork gouge tools and Angostura, Golondrina, Big Sandy,
Lerma, Hoxie, and Abasolo points dart points that date to the Late Paleoindian and the
very early Archaic period. The artifact densities are highest in the 3Ab and 3AB
horizon, and then decrease with depth (Figure 29). Unit levels in these horizons have the
greatest weight of fire cracked rock of the entire profile, which raises the possibility of
this concentration deriving from a pedogenic stone line as opposed to cultural behavior.
Closer review of the FCR distributions finds and average increase in FCR by level but
large fire cracked rock concentration feature in one level of unit N397 E852 accounts for
over half the FCR weight in level 20. This variability does not suggest the development
of a uniform stone line. Another more definitive argument against the development of a
stone line is that there is no spike in lithic artifact weight that corresponds to the increase
in FCR. Lithic debitage does not increase in weight at these levels, which suggests the
increased FCR weight is due to cultural processes and not pedogenic ones.
Holocene Unit Ib is an approximately 60 cm thick buried cumulic 2Ab horizon.
The horizon is dark gray fine sand with a weak coarse blocky subangular structure. The
particle size distributions reveal a very slight fining upwards sequence to this deposit;
otherwise the uniform characteristics of the soils provide little to differentiate horizons.

82

Figure 29. Excavation Area 4 artifact distributions by unit level

The pollen assemblage from this unit was nearly as poor as the samples from Unit Ia,
with only a few Populus, ASTERACEAE, POACEAE, and FABACEAE Mimosa-like
pollen recovered. Diagnostic prehistoric artifacts from this horizon date to the Middle
Archaic. Pandora (2), Tortuga (2), and Pedernales, dart points were recovered, as well as
Clear Fork gouges and bone tools. The concentration of artifacts decreases relative to
later upper horizons, but there is still more lithic debitage by weight than lower Early
Archaic/Late Paleoindian occupations.
Holocene Unit Ic is approximately 110 cm thick and is a mollic epipedon. The
soil stratigraphy of this unit is an Ap-A1-AC, though the sediments are quite uniform
and the AC horizon could be just as well described as an A2. More pollen was
recovered from this unit than the lower two units, however pollen concentrations were
still very low. ASTERACEAE was most prevalent, though approximately half the
pollen grains observed were not identified because they were too degraded. The

83

sediments are very dark gray loamy fine sand with massive single grained structure.
Historic, Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic diagnostic artifacts were recovered from this
unit. The Historic and Late Prehistoric artifacts are found in the upper 60 cm, while Late
Archaic artifacts extend from the upper 60 cm to the base of the unit. Forged and square
nails, as well as a clay marble and various historic ceramics were recovered. The Late
Prehistoric diagnostic artifacts consist of indigenous pottery, Perdiz arrow points, and
Scallorn dart points. One hearth was recorded in this upper portion of the horizon, and
two hearths were recorded in the lower Late Archaic component. Marcos, Friday, and
Ensor diagnostic points were recovered from the Late Archaic component. Artifact
concentrations are highest in the lower A1 and AC horizons. There are clear examples
of bioturbation in the form of large roots, infilled rodent burrows, and fine insect
burrows. However though there are examples of bioturbation the three intact hearth
features suggest that bioturbation has not been significant enough to totally obliterate the
cultural context of unit Ic.
The Excavation Area 5 is located approximately 30 m downslope to the
southwest of the Excavation Area 4. The stratigraphy of the unit is similar to Area 4,
except Holocene Units Ia and Ib are not present in this unit. Instead two thick cumulic A
horizons (A1-A2) that correlate to Holocene unit Ic were identified above the
Deweyville Paleosol. The unit is 1 x 2 m in area and extends to a depth of 150 cm. An
auger (# 5-33) was excavated to 230 cm below the bottom of the unit. Approximately
120 cm of deposits with diagnostic Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric artifacts
unconformably overlie the Deweyville Paleosol (Figure 30). The upper A1 horizon is 54

84

Figure 30. Excavation Area 5 profile

cm thick. A greater concentration of prehistoric artifacts observed in this horizon, and
included lithic debitage and tools, animal bone, mussel shell, snail shell, and occasional
charcoal. Some historic artifacts were also observed in this upper horizon. There are
large roots in the profile and no bedding structure but otherwise there is little evidence of
severe bioturbation. The underlying Deweyville Paleosol is 100 cm thick with both the
argillic and calcic portions of the soil intact. Below are fine sands with gravelly
components that correspond to the fluvial deposits of the Deweyville Formation.
Anaqua Mott. The two excavation units in the Anaqua Mott portion of the site
encountered relatively shallow but quite concentrated archaeological deposits that date

85

from the Late Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. These deposits form a midden
approximately 40-50 cm thick from 20 to 30 cm below ground surface. Artifact
concentrations decrease with depth until all artifact material ceases at a gradual
unconformable contact with Deweyville calcic and fluvial deposits.
The Anaqua Mott 1 x 2 m unit (Unit N341 E883-883) is positioned
approximately midslope of the Anaqua Mott area. This excavation unit was excavated
to 140 cm below surface, and an auger (#5-37) continued another 260 cm below the
bottom of the excavation unit (Figure 31). The profile including the auger data consists
of Holocene Unit Ic and the Deweyville Formation, with a soil sequence of A1-A2-A3AE-2C. Unit Ic is a thick cumulic mollic epipedon, and a weak elluvial horizon with a
gradual boundary with underlying sands and deep calcic horizons of the Deweyville
Formation. The archaeological materials are confined primarily to the upper horizons
A1, A2, A3, and AE. A distinct midden has formed between 34 and 88 cm below the
surface in horizons A2 and A3 with very dark brown organic rich loamy fine sands. The
soil color of the midden is distinctly darker than the upper and lower horizons and has
abundant charcoal wood fragments and stains, animal bone, snail shell, mussel shell,
small fire cracked rock, and lithic artifacts. Diagnostic dart and arrow points from this
midden date the deposit to the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric (2,000-300 B.P.).
According to THC Stewards records four Perdiz arrow points, one glass Cameron point,
one Scallorn point, one Fairland, one Marcos, and two unidentified Triangular dart
points were recovered. The majority of the diagnostic artifacts were recovered from the
midden levels, but the Fairland and one of the Late Triangular dart point were recovered

decrease with depth, and no earlier archaeological components were identified.
Evidence of bioturbation in the form of roots and burrows infilled with sandy sediments
throughout the profile demonstrates that the area has experienced some disturbance.
Deweyville Paleosol is completely eroded exposing the underlying fluvial sands.
Anaqua Mott 2 x 2 m unit (Units N 324-325 E 886-887) is 17 m downslope of
the Anaqua Mott 1 x 2 m unit. This excavation unit has a very similar stratigraphy to the
1 x2 m unit, but the Holocene depositional unit Ic mantling the Deweyville Formation is
not as thick. It the 2 x 2 m unit was excavated to a depth of 94 cm and an auger (#5)

87

continued 108 cm from the bottom of unit N324 E886. The archaeological deposits
consisted of the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric midden in Unit Ic which has a soil
designation of A1-A2-A3-AE (Figure 32). The THC Stewards records show from this
unit Perdiz, Darl, Fairland, a Pandora- like knife, and Scallorn points were recovered.
These diagnostic artifacts were recovered from the midden levels of the unit, and unlike
the Anaqua Mott 1x2 m unit there is not a Marcos component. This suggests a slightly
younger age for this portion of the midden, as the diagnostics dating back to only 1800
B.P. The midden formed between 20 and 64 cm below ground surface. Like the midden

deposits in the other unit the sediments are a darker color than the upper and lower
horizons, with abundant prehistoric cultural material. A few scattered mussel shells and
a proximal fragment of a Golondrina- like point were recovered at the base of the unit at
the gradual contact with the 2Ck calcic soil deposits of the Deweyville Formation.
Though the recovery of early artifacts was limited to the possible Golondrina point, it
suggests the possibility of an earlier archaeological component below the midden. There
is less evidence for disturbance in these excavation units, except for burrows in the AE
horizon that are infilled with A horizon sediments from the upper levels.
Paleo Area. The Paleo Area is located on the southeastern margin of the terrace.
The surface of the terrace is approximately 2-3 m lower in elevation than the Main Site
Area. The Paleo Area has produced many intriguing early prehistoric artifacts, but the
borrow pit excavations and subsequent erosion has been both a blessing and a curse for
the geoarchaeological investigations (Figure 33). Numerous Late Paleoindian/Early
Archaic diagnostic artifacts have been recovered from this portion of the site; however
they have primarily come from disturbed contexts. Fortunately, two excavations
conducted by THC Stewards in conjunction with geoarchaeological investigations have
helped place some of these artifacts in context.
The Paleo Area Profile consists of the profile description of a large section of
wall created by the borrow pit operations on the northwestern, upslope side of the Paleo
Area (Figures 34, 35). This wall was described on three occasions. The first recorded
the basic stratigraphy and collected samples for particle size analysis. The second
description consisted of cleaning a large portion of the wall and a smaller section to the

north to examine the stratigraphy in a larger section and to assess artifact distribution of
artifacts in the profile. The third description came during the collection of OSL samples.
The stratigraphy recorded at this exposure formed the foundation for correlating the soils
and sediments of this portion of the site. The profile and auger has evidence of
Holocene Units Ia, Ib, Ic, and the Deweyville Formation. The soil horizon sequence is
A-2Ab1-2AB-3Btkb1-3Btkb2-3BC-3C-3Bk. Holocene Unit Ic correlates to the very
dark grayish brown loamy fine sand from 0-65 cm below ground surface. The A horizon
was soft with massive to fine blocky subangular structure. Few prehistoric artifacts were
observed in this unit, which is quite different from other examples of this unit in the
Anaqua Mott and the Main Site Area that have abundant prehistoric artifacts. Below this
horizon is a buried paleosol at the top of Holocene Unit Ib that can be correlated to the
paleosol (2Ab) in Excavation Area 4 and the Burial Area #1 and #2. This 2Ab1 horizon
is a dark grayish brown fine sandy loam found 65-100 cm below the ground surface.
The horizon is firm when wet and has a weak coarse parting to fine blocky subangular
structure. Prehistoric lithic artifacts are very common in this horizon, as are snail shells.
The snail shells include Rabdotus and an unidentified species, and most are broken.
This depositional unit continues with a 2Ab2 horizon from 100-138 cm below the
ground surface, though it is not present across the entire profile. This horizon is a
grayish brown fine sandy loam with weak fine blocky subangular structure. Few lithic
artifacts were observed but numerous snail shells, both Rabdotus and the unidentified
species, were observed. Though most of the snail shell was broken some of the
Rabdotus were whole. Freshwater mussel shells were also observed in this horizon.

92

Unit Ia is found from 138-174 cm as a weak 2Btkb1-calcic horizon with prehistoric
cultural material. This horizon correlates to the calcic portion of the Deweyville
Paleosol that underlies the red gleyed sandy clay loam, however it was reworked during
the early Holocene. As evidenced in this profile and adjacent augers the red paleosol is
eroded away exposing the lower calcic horizon, which was then subsequently
redeposited as colluvium then formed a prehistoric living surface. This 3Btkb2 horizon
is a brown fine sandy loam with weak fine blocky subangular structure. There are
common (15%) calcic filaments and fine soft masses. There are occasional lithic
artifacts with a white to grayish patina, and numerous snail and freshwater mussel shell.
One Clear Fork gouge tool was identified in the profile. The calcic horizon of Unit Ia
continues as 2Btkb2 from 174-202 cm below ground surface. This light yellowish
brown fine sandy loam sees a decrease in calcium carbonate, with only occasional large
granule to small pebble sized calcic nodules. OSL sample #2 was collected from the top
of this level, and produced dates of 25,800 + 1630 yr (UIC1691IR), and 23,700 + 1495
yr (UIC1691GR) with the two-sigma age ranges overlapping at 24,200-27,400 yr and
22,500-25,200 yr. This is probably the result of partially bleached, mixed sediments, and
does not represent the true age of the sediments or cultural deposits. The artifact content
of this horizon decreases, with no shells and only one flake of lithic debitage observed.
The final horizon observed in profile is a very pale brown medium to fine grained sand
that extends from 202 cm to the limit of the profile exposure at 250 cm. This sand has
only very occasional granule sized calcic nodules. A biface fragment with significant
calcic patina, as well as one chert flake of debitage was observed in this profile.

93

Considering the OSL date of from approximately 40 cm above these artifacts they can be
explained either as artifacts translocated by bio-pedoturbation into the sandy substrate or
artifacts deposited in portion of the fluvial sands that were reworked colluvially before
the calcic horizon was redeposited above the sands. Only additional OSL dating using
methods that can account for mixed bleaching of sediments, as well as additional
excavation will be able to determine the nature and chronology of these scattered
archaeological deposits. Auger #1 below the surface continued the exposure to a depth
of and additional 40 cm. The Deweyville sands with very occasional calcic granules of
soil horizon 3C continued to a depth of 280 cm below ground surface, with no additional
prehistoric artifacts recovered. The sands became more gravelly and coarse with depth.
The auger reached its maximum depth at 290 due to contact with impenetrable gravelly
calcic sandy clay of the 3Ck horizon. This deep calcic horizon may correspond to deep
calcic horizons encountered adjacent to the Paleo Area Excavation Unit, Auger #2 in the
bottom of Paleo Burial Excavation Unit, and Auger #10-6 however these deep calcic
horizons are found up to 1.5 m deeper in profile than the deep calcic horizon in the Paleo
Profile.
The Paleo Area Excavation Unit is an area of 3 x 4 m that was excavated to a
depth of approximately 65 cm below the truncated surface (Figures 36, 37). The
excavation unit is 20 m to the south and down slope of the Profile exposure. The THC
Stewards have not completed the artifact inventory of this excavation unit, so at this time
only diagnostic artifacts and a general summary of artifact findings are available for
stratigraphic interpretation. Approximately 50-75 cm of the A1 soil horizon that

94

Figure 36. Paleo Area Excavation unit profile

95

Figure 37. Photo of Paleo Area Excavation unit (facing west wall)

correlates to Holocene unit Ic and the top of the 2Ab horizon that correlates to Holocene
unit Ib were removed as part of the borrow pit excavations. The excavation units
encountered 10-15 cm of disturbed sediments underlain by a soil horizon sequence of
2Bt1-2Bt2-2BC-2CB that were probably buried by slope wash as Holocene unit Ia. The
2Bt1 is approximately 15 cm thick very dark grayish brown sandy clay with strong
coarse blocky angular structure. The THC Stewards recovered numerous diagnostic
artifacts from this horizon. This horizon encountered one Clear Fork Gouge,
Golondrina, Angostura, Uvalde, and Saint Mary Hall dart points, which date from the
Late Paleoindian to the Early Archaic periods. Biface preforms, lithic debitage, and
scattered burned rock were also observed in the profile and in excavation at this horizon.
A Bulverde dart point and three Clear Fork Gouges were recovered at the contact

96

between this horizon and the next lower horizon. If the field designation of the Bulverde
point, which dates to the Late Archaic, holds after the analysis of diagnostic artifacts it
will imply significant mixing of prehistoric components at this portion of the site. The
2Bt2 horizon is approximately 15 cm thick and consists of dark grayish brown sandy
clay loam with moderate coarse parting to fine blocky subangular structure. This
horizon produced four Clear Fork Gouges and another unidentified gouge tool. At the
base of this horizon a Golondrina dart point was recovered. The 2BC horizon consisted
of a 15 cm thick brown sandy loam with weak medium blocky subangular structure and
approximately 1% small pebbles. A Plainview dart point and four Clear Fork gouge
tools were recovered in this horizon. Below this horizon was a15 cm thick 2CB horizon
only exposed in the northern upslope portion of the excavation unit. This horizon was a
brown medium sandy loam with common small pebbles and few boulders at the base of
the excavation unit with a massive structure. Very few artifacts were recovered from
this unit with only one Clear Fork Gouge tool recovered. Based on the position of these
gravels relative to gravels encountered in augers further upslope it is presumed that the
gravels correlate to the gravel of the underlying fluvial deposits of the Deweyville
Formation.
No features were recorded in these units, and field observations found many of
the artifacts orientated at an angle with a general appearance of being disturbed or in
secondary context. The stratigraphy of the diagnostic artifacts shows some mixing of
Late Paleoindian, Early Archaic occupations, and possibly Late Archaic artifacts
considering the recovery of the Bulverde point. Considering the unit location some

97

degree of slope wash would have translocated artifacts before their burial by Holocene
depositional units Ia and Ib. There is no evidence of the calcic portion of the Deweyville
Paleosol, which is found upslope. Instead the remnants of a lower nearly entirely
cemented calcic horizon of the Deweyville Formation are found immediately east of the
excavation unit. In a nearby cut there is an example of the 2Btb soil unconformably
above the calcic soil. There are no artifacts in the calcic soil or the fluvial deposits
observed in profile below the calcic horizon.
Approximately 20 m to the southeast of the Paleo Area profile two human
remains was recovered in salvage and test excavations. A 1 x 2 m unit was excavated to
a maximum depth of 110 cm below ground surface (Figure 38). The original surface
was truncated by borrow pit excavations, and based on a small island of the original
surface to the south and natural ground surfaces to the southeast the original ground
surface is estimated to be 40-60 cm above the current surface. The missing section
would have included Holocene Unit Ic. A portion of Holocene Unit Ic is present, as is
all of Holocene Unit Ib and a portion of the Deweyville Formation were identified in the
section. Holocene Unit Ia may exist in this section below Ib. The excavation unit has a
stratigraphy similar to the Paleo Area Profile, except the upper A-2Ab horizon is thicker
at the burials and the calcic horizon is thinner than the Paleo Area Profile.
On the borrow pit surface badly disturbed and poorly preserved human remains
were identified. These remains consisted of some scattered teeth, femur, and fragments
of the tibia and fibia. These remains were not dated. In an effort to understand the
stratigraphy of this portion of the site an auger was placed near the burial (Auger 2) and

98

Figure 38. Paleo Area Burial unit profile

coincidentally human remains were recovered from a burial approximately 90 cm below
surface. The THC stewards and physical anthropologist Dr. Jennifer Rice conducted test
excavations to recover this burial. The truncated A horizon would have been
approximately 60-80 cm thick, though only the bottom 18 cm are preserved as the upper
albeit disturbed horizon of the unit. The sediments are a very dark brown fine sandy
loam. The deposits are hard when dry but are massive and structureless. Snail shell
fragments, lithics and unidentified bones were observed in profile. From 18-40 cm is the
2Ab1 horizon, which is the upper portion of Unit Ib. This horizon is very dark grayish
brown fine sandy loam that is very hard when dry and very firm when moist. The
horizon was observed as massive and structureless, however the profile was not
disturbed to test ped structure to maintain the integrity of the profile wall. This unit had

99

a dark greasy midden- like color and texture, and prehistoric lithics, shell, and FCR were
observed in profile. Unit Ib continues below this soil horizon as 2Ab2 and 2Ab3
horizons that extend to a variable depth of 80-100 cm below ground surface. These
horizons are very dark grayish brown fine sandy loams that are massive but soft in
texture as opposed to the overlying 2Ab1 horizon. Prehistoric artifacts were observed in
both horizons, though the upper 2Ab2 horizon had fewer prehistoric artifacts. The 2Ab3
horizon has more prehistoric artifacts than the upper horizon and appears to truncate
lower horizons in the location of the burial. The burial was recovered from the base of
this unit approximately 90-100 cm below ground surface. The burial was dated in a
sample submitted by Dr. Jennifer Rice to Beta Analytic Inc. AMS dated the bone
collagen sample to 3,650 14 C yr B.P., making it the oldest dated burial of the site (Rice
personal communication). Considering the evidence of the upper horizon truncating the
lower horizon in the area of the burial the 3,650 14 C yr B.P., date probably occured
before the formation of the 2Ab1 paleosol. Below this horizon the excavation unit
encountered dark grayish brown to grayish brown fine sandy loams that have a decrease
in the amount of prehistoric artifacts. The 3AbC horizons are a transition between these
Holocene Unit Ib and possibly Unit Ia depositional units and the lower reworked calcic
horizon of the Deweyville Paleosol. The limit of the exposure of the excavation unit
was 110 cm below ground surface; however Auger 2 extended the exposure by 65 cm.
This transitional horizon continues for another 15 cm. Below the horizon is a 35 cm
thick 3Bk horizon. This horizon correlates to the calcic paleosol portion of the
Deweyville Paleosol. The deposit is a light brownish gray fine sandy loam with

100

calcareous granules and calcium carbonate crusted large rounded pebbles. Observed
mussel shell fragments suggest that this was once a living surface during the Holocene,
or that Holocene artifacts were translocated down the profile through bio-pedoturbation.
Below this horizon to the limit of the exposure at 175 cm below the ground surface is the
weakly cemented buried calcic horizon, which is encountered upslope below the sandy
Deweyville deposits and downslope to the southwest near the Paleo Area Excavation
Units below the Holocene deposits. The deposit is pale yellow coarse sandy clay that is
entirely calcified. No cultural material was observed in this horizon.
Sand Pit. The Sand Pit is an area approximately 40,000 m2 on the tread of the
Deweyville Terrace that was excavated for fill dirt. The pit is largely devoid of cultural
material, with only occasional, scattered lithic artifacts observed. No test or salvage
units were excavated in this portion of the site, but the walls of pit provided abundant
opportunities to examine the deposits (Figure 39). Subsurface testing to determine the
relationship between the upper Holocene deposits and the underlying Deweyville
Paleosol and fluvial deposits were described in previous sections. This section describes
a detailed profile of the upper sandy deposits in relation to the Holocene stratigraphy,
and details the archaeological findings from this portion of the site.
One portion of the sand pit was cleaned and profiled. This section was 3 m wide
and 1.75 m deep with a 0.25 m pit to extend the profile deeper (Figure 40). Holocene
Units Ic, was identified in this profile, though unit Ib may be present at the base of the
profile. The profile exhibited an A1-A2-E/Bt-C horizon sequence, and did not encounter
the Deweyville Paleosol. The A1-A2-E/Bt sequence is similar to Holocene Unit Ic, and

101

Figure 40. Sand Pit photo and profile

102

though the C horizon does not have the paleosol at the top of the Unit Ib the C horizon is
in the same stratigraphic position below an E/Bt horizon like exposures of Unit Ib on the
edge of the terrace. The epipedon is brown fine sand with little to no evidence of
cultural material, however bioturbation in the form of infilled insect and rodent burrows
is common. Below the A1-A2 horizon the E/Bt horizon has clay lamellae that increase
in frequency with depth. The evidence of bioturbation decreases in this level, but there
are still infilled rodent and insect burrows. The upper 40 cm of this level has dispersed
fine charcoal and occasional undiagnostic lithic artifacts and small well rounded pebbles.
The artifacts and pebbles were all recovered from a cluster in a rodent burrow,
demonstrating the impacts of bioturbation. The surfaces of the chert artifacts have a
shiny polish and feel slick to the touch. This cond ition may result from abrasion by
sands, which could have been caused by artifact translocation through the profile. No
artifacts were recovered from below the upper portion of the E/Bt horizon.
The lack of diagnostic artifacts, and the effects of bioturbation complicate
developing an archaeological stratigraphy of the Sand Pit and the tread of the
Deweyville Terrace. Lithic artifacts and diffuse charcoal flecks were observed in other
exposures in the Sand Pit, but the abundant evidence of disturbance and potential for
artifact translocation has potentially obliterated any cultural stratigraphy. Considering
the likely eolian reworking of the upper horizons of this surface, and the probably
limited prehistoric occupations on the tread, there appears to be limited potential for
future recovery of archaeological deposits in this portion of the site.

103

Comparison to Similar Sites
Though there are a number of archaeological sites in the region associated with
Deweyville terraces there is little work on site formation processes associated with these
terraces. The stratigraphy of this site is compared to the stratigraphy of three other sites,
however only one of the sites is in an analogous context. First the stratigraphy will be
compared to the Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98). This site is most analogous to the
McNeil- Gonzales site, and has had the most comprehensive geoarchaeological
investigation of any site in the region (Frederick and Bateman 2004). The site will also
be compared to the Berger Bluff site (41GD30) (Brown 1983, Brown 1986, Brown
1996). This site is in a different physiographic setting and the final report of the site has
not been published, but it worthwhile to compare because it is the earliest recorded site
in the region, and shares some of the same depositional processes as the McNeilGonzales site. Finally the Loma Sandia site will be examined. The Loma Sandia site
(41LK28) is found in a very different setting in the interior of the Coastal Plain, but
similar stratigraphy, cultural artifacts, and a prehistoric cemetery make it a worthwhile
comparison (Taylor and Highley 1995). Other sites such as Blue Bayou (41VT94), and
the Cinco Ranch sites in Fort Bend County have similarities to the McNeill- Gonzales
site, but they either have limited geomorphic data to compare with, like Blue Bayou, or
they do not have a cemetery component and are limited to relatively late deposits such as
the Cinco Ranch sites (Huebner and Comuzzie 1992, Ensor 1987).
Buckeye Knoll (41VT98). The most comprehensive study is the work by
Frederick and Bateman (2005: 11-15) at the Buckeye Knoll site. As described in the

104

previous chapter the site is located in a mantle of Holocene sands on a Deweyville
Terrace, and Beaumont Formation upland of the Guadalupe River Valley. The
Deweyville Formation stratigraphy was described in the previous chapter, but the
Holocene sands were not compared to the archaeological deposits and Holocene
depositional units of the McNeill- Gonzales site. The research identified four Holocene
depositional units that were dominated by sands with pedogenic alteration but no Bhorizons. The deposits aggraded episodically, first mantling the Beaumont Formation,
then infilling depressions in the buried paleosol of the Deweyville Formation, and finally
aggrading atop the sandy mantle. Though there was variability across the site the
general soil horizon sequence was A-2Ab-2AC-2CA-3AC-3CA (Fredrick and Bateman
2004: Figure B). Holocene Unit 1 mantles the Beaumont Formation and contains Early
Archaic Bell and Early Triangular points in one portion of the site, and Late Paleoindian
Dalton, Barber, and Golondrina points in another. The bottom of the unit was a
yellowish brown, and the unit became a very dark gray at the top of the unit. Analysis of
total organic carbon found an increase in organic carbon at the top of the deposit, which
they interpreted along with the darker color to be a paleosol capping the deposit. There
Holocene Unit 1 is similar to the Holocene Unit Ia in Excavation Area 4 at the McNeillGonzales site, except that at the McNeil-Gonzales site the Unit Ia formed on the
Deweyville Terrace, not the Beaumont Formation.
Holocene Unit 2 truncated portions of Holocene Unit 1 and began infilling
depressions on the truncated Deweyville Paleosol and the Beaumont Formation. The
unit had a lighter color C horizon and a darker buried A horizon above. OSL dating

105

dated the deposit from 6 to 4 ka, which corresponds to the Early-Middle Archaic. Most
of the prehistoric burials dated to the early part of this period of deposition. This unit
corresponds to Unit Ib at the McNeill- Gonzales site. A difference is that there is not
evidence of this unit truncating the earlier Unit Ia.
Holocene Unit 3 continued filling depressions and intense prehistoric occupation
led to the formation of a midden. The unit had a distinct A-C horizon sequence, except
for areas with dense midden accumulation. The unit had quite variable ages, ranging
from 3.8 to 1.2 ka, which spans from the Late Middle Archaic to the Early Late
Prehistoric. It appears that deposition of this unit took place at different times across the
terrace surface. This unit has some attributes of Unit Ic at the McNeill-Gonzales site,
but the chronology is different. Midden deposits did occur at the McNeill-Gonzales site,
but the artifact content of horizon and the middens dated only to the Late Archaic and
Late Prehistoric. Holocene Unit 3 of the Buckeye Knoll site began aggrading earlier and
at varying times across the site. The McNeill-Gonzales site may have seen variable
periodicity in the aggradation of unit Ic as well but the chronometric resolution is poor
considering that diagnostic artifacts were the only means of establishing chronology of
these deposits.
The final unit identified at the Buckeye Knoll site was Holocene Unit 4. This
unit is a cumulic dark A horizon that is time transgressive as it moves up the slope of the
terrace surface. The lower portions are the thickest and date from the Late Archaic to
the Late Prehistoric (2.5 ka to present), while the portions further up the slope are thinner
and only date to the Late Prehistoric (approx 1 ka to present). This unit lacks a strong

106

midden component. In some ways it is like the upper- most portion of Unit Ic at the
McNeill-Gonzales site which typically has approximately 20-30 cm of dark cumulic
sediments above the midden portion of the unit, and some downslope areas such as in
the Paleo Area Burial Unit have a thickened horizon as compared to areas further
upslope.
The stratigraphy of the Buckeye Knoll site is very similar to the McNeillGonzales site, and their study into the origin of the deposits has the potential to shed
light on the depositional origin of the McNeill- Gonzales site. Numerous methods were
employed to determine the method of deposition and the sediment source for the
Holocene sands, however the results were inconclusive. Granulometric, heavy mineral,
mineral magnetics, elemental, and SEM studies of quartz grain surface
micromorphology provided conflicting results. In the end the researchers hypothesized
that the deposits originated from local eolian reworking of Deweyville sands based on
the morphology of the sand sheet deposit, but they could not come to a firm conclusion
because of the discrepancies in the data sets (Frederick and Bateman 2004: 15-19).
Berger Bluff (41GD30). The Berger Bluff site provides an interesting
comparison because it has one of the earliest dated archaeological components in the
region. The site is located on a bluff on Coleto Creek, and has been inundated by the
Coleto Creek Reservoir. Like the McNeill-Gonzales site it has a long history of
occupation with stratified archaeological deposits from the Paleoindian period to the
Late Prehistoric, though in a mixture of aggrading floodplain deposits for the earlier
archaeological components and an upper mantle of colluvium and eolian deposits for the

107

later components that has characteristics similar to the McNeill-Gonzales site. A distinct
difference is that the earliest components of the site were buried by alluvial
sedimentation, and then subsequently indurated by calcium carbonate from a now buried
spring. These deposits had exceptionally well preserved faunal remains, unlike the Late
Paleoindian components of the McNeill-Gonzales site (Brown 1986). In comparison far
fewer lithic artifacts were recovered from these early components and it appears that a
short term occupation with specific activity areas occurred at the site (Brown 1996). The
middle 4.5 m of the site were not tested but the upper portions of the site were tested by
excavation units and had Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components remarkably
similar to the McNeill- Gonzales site. The upper deposits are described as brown loamy
fine sand with dense Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic artifacts (Brown 1983). These
deposits are similar to the deposits of the McNeil- Gonzales site and are an example of
how a sandy loam mantle of colluvial and potential eolian sediments can exist on lower
order streams like Coleto Creek, and with different underlying geologic formations.
Though the Paleoindian component is in a different depositional setting than the
McNeill-Gonzales site it demonstrates how complex depositional environments can
preserve multicomponent sites.
Loma Sandia (41LK28). The Loma Sandia site is located on a sandy knoll
overlooking a small tributary of the Frio River in the interior of the Gulf Coastal Plain.
The site has occupations spanning back to the Paleoindian Period, though the most
impressive feature of the site is the very large cemetery that dates from the Middle
Archaic period (2,850-2,550 B.P.). Holliday summarized the geoarchaeology of the site,

108

though his research was hindered by being written after the completion of the field work
(Holliday 1995). The site primarily consisted of approximately 1 to 3 m of loamy fine
sands (Stratum 3) overlying a truncated buried paleoargillic horizon (Stratum 1) and
colluvial wash on the margin of the knoll (Stratum 2). The paleoargillic horizon is
described as red sandy clay, which is similar to the Deweyville Paleosol at the McNeillGonzales site. The upper deposits consisted of an A-AC-C soil horizon that saw
significant bioturbation. The deposits were generally gray brown in color and possibly
had clay lamellae developme nt. The upper A horizons were stained with dark colored
organics and contained primarily Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric components. This is
similar to the Ic deposits of the McNeill- Gonzales site. The older Middle and Early
Archaic components occurred in the thicker AC and C horizons. These thicker horizons
saw less pedoturbation and appear to have aggraded fairly rapidly during these periods.
This correlates to the Ib deposits on the upper portion of the McNeill- Gonzales site.
Though the McNeill- Gonzales site Ib unit is typically darker colored with a preserved A
horizon paleosol it is a relatively thick deposit with a general decrease in artifact
concentrations. This may help corroborate a regional correlation of more arid climates
and increased eolian transport during the Middle Archaic. The Late Paleoindian
component at the base of the sand deposits is relatively minor at this site and does not
provide much opportunity for comparison. A final observation from the Loma Sandia
site is how localized and compact a prehistoric cemetery can be, which suggests a great
deal of the prehistoric cemetery at the McNeill- Gonzales site may have been destroyed.
According to the report approximately 205 individuals were excavated primarily from an

109

area 144 m2 (Taylor and Highley 1995: iii). Approximately 5,625 m2 around the
excavated burial areas were destroyed by borrow pit operations at the McNeill- Gonzales
site. If the McNeill- Gonzales site had burials at even a fraction of the density of the
Loma Sandia site than a significant number of burials were destroyed and are now
presumably resting in countless Victoria area gardens.

110

CHAPTER V
CONCLUSION

Geoarchaeological investigations at the McNeill-Gonzales site placed this site in
a stratigraphic context, as a framework for future archaeological research. It also
developed a model of site formation that can be tested at other sites in similar
geomorphic settings, provided information on the soils and slope processes of
Deweyville terraces, and presented additional dates on the Deweyville Formation. This
conclusion presents a model of site formation and prehistoric occupation at the McNeillGonzales site, and suggests future lines of investigation.
Model of Site Formation and Prehistoric Occupation
Interpretations of site formation at the McNeill-Gonzales site most closely
resemble a model presented by Paine for sites on the slopes of the San Jacinto River
terrace (Paine 1987, 1990, Abbott 2001). In this model a Pleistocene surface of the
Beaumont Formation is laterally incised by the San Jacinto River as it downcuts during
the Late Glacial sea level lowstand. This lateral incision and gullying of the terrace
continues until the Early Holocene when sea level rise and floodplain aggradation
begins. Slopes then develop a colluvial mantle on the margins of the Pleistocene terrace.
This mantle laterally truncates the Pleistocene soil, and archaeological deposits become
incorporated into the colluvial mantle. The sites Paine (1987, 1990) studied were
primarily Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric in age, and the colluvial mantle were finegrained sediments that derived from the Beaumont Formation.

111

Landscape development of the McNeill-Gonzales site is very similar, except
instead of being clayey sediments of the Beaumont Formation the deposits are
predominately sandy fluvial deposits of the Deweyville Formation. The other important
factor involved is that a sandy mantle of Holocene deposits covers the Deweyville
Terrace. At the McNeill- Gonzales site the Deweyville terrace stopped aggrading and
developed a soil beginning shortly after 60,000 yr. Sea level drop associated with the
Late Glacial led to downcutting and the lateral erosion of the Deweyville surface, which
created the terrace. This lateral erosion stripped off portions of the Deweyville Paleosol
as well as underlying fluvial deposits. Surficial erosion and gullying also impacted the
Deweyville surface. These actions truncated the surface of the terrace creating
topographic depressions, and gullies that exposed the calcic portion of the Deweyville
Paleosol, and the underlying sandy fluvial deposits. The remnant of a small postDeweyville paleochannel on the edge of the terrace is testament to the erosional forces
acting on the Deweyville terrace. This channel probably rapidly filled during the initial
period of floodplain aggradation, though chronological control of this feature is very
weak.
The truncated Deweyville Paleosol became the first living surface for prehistoric
peoples approximately 10,000-8,000 B.P. People using Plainview and Golondrina
projectile points occupied the slopes of the Deweyville terrace, primarily on the
southeastern portion atop the exposed calcic paleosol, and atop the relatively minimally
eroded paleosol further upslope on the central portion of the terrace. Though the artifact
analysis has yet to be completed, the numerous wood working gouge tools in these early

112

portions of the site suggests woodworking activities at the site. It stands to reason that
during this period of the early Holocene when it was cooler and drier than present the
riparian zones along the floodplains may have been the only locations where hardwood
for tools, shelter and transport were located.
Sometime after the incision and lateral erosion that created the Deweyville
terrace the deposition of an eolian sandy mantle began on the terrace (Unit Ia). Low
surfaces along the terrace margins began aggrading with fine sand. It is uncertain how
much sand was deposited on the terrace tread at this time because the deposits atop the
tread have not been correlated and dated. Along the terrace scarp prehistoric settlement
continued with additional Late Paleoindian to Early Archaic diagnostic artifacts being
recovered. Angostura, Saint Mary Hall, Big Sandy, and Lerma Late Paleoindian/Early
Archaic dart points were recovered, as well as the ubiquitous Clear Fork gouges. A
weak paleosol developed atop the fine sands of these deposits on the western edge of the
terrace and while fine sands began to fill the paleo- gully on the western portion of the
scarp, and mantle the reworked colluvial deposits of the Deweyville paleosol calcic
horizon on the eastern side of the terrace. The soil did not form on the eastern side of
the terrace and instead the sedimentation continued into the Early Archaic where Uvalde
and Bulverde dart points of the Early to Middle Archaic are found mixed with the earlier
Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic dart points.
A thicker sand deposit of Unit Ib continued filling low- lying portions of the
terrace and possibly mantled the entire tread of the Deweyville terrace. This thicker
sand deposit has artifacts of the Middle and Early Archaic (8,000-2,500 B.P.). This

113

potentially correlates to the Middle Holocene period of aridity that is inferred to have
occurred on a regional scale. On the eastern edge of the terrace in the Paleo Area fine
sands continued aggrading with the continuation of prehistoric occupation. The earliest
dated burial is found in this deposit, and it dates to 3,650 14 C yr B.P. Freshwater mussel
shells and snail shells appear in the site matrix, which suggests close proximity to a
channel that could support beds of mussels. The interpretation of a nearby stream
channel also implies that sandy would have been adjacent to the terrace, and point bars
or overbank deposits could have been deflated in close proximity to the terrace. There
are fewer mussel shells on the western portion of the site, though by this time the paleogully below the Burial Areas had nearly completely filled to the level of the terrace
tread.
Towards the end of the Middle Archaic (2,500-3,000 B.P.) a paleosol formed at
the top of the fine sand deposits. This paleosol is a mollic and has more strongly
developed soil structure. This soil is found on the western portion of the terrace scarp in
the Burial Areas, the Area 4 Excavation unit, and on the eastern edge of the scarp in the
Paleo Area. There was enough stability in the Paleo Excavation Area for the formation
of a weak illuvial horizon in the lower portions of Early Archaic/Late Paleoindian
deposits.
From the Late Archaic to the Present (2,500 B.P. to present) sedimentation
continued across the tread and the scarp. During this period the aggradation Unit Ic
covered the entire surface, with thick sand deposits aggrading at the Main Site Area on
the western edge of the terrace, colluvial deposits accumulating at the central portion of

114

the terrace for the first time in the Anaqua Mott Area, and a relatively thin deposit of
sand mantling the eastern portion of the terrace in the Paleo Area. In the thicker portions
of the deposit pedogenic clay lamellae develop, which can be traced from the Main Site
Area to the Sand Pit on the terrace tread. This depositional unit has the greatest
concentration of prehistoric artifacts, with distinct midden deposits of darker sediments
and high concentrations of cultural artifacts occurring in the Anaqua Mott and
downslope portions of the main site area in Excavation Area 5. The two of the burials
recovered from the Main Site Area date to the Late Archaic and considering much of the
area where the burials were located were destroyed by the borrow pit operations there
may have been a substantial Late Archaic cemetery at this portion of the site.
Suggestions for Future Work
Future work at the site would benefit from more radiometric dating to better
correlate deposits across the terrace and scarp. Most of the soil and sediment ages come
from relative ages of diagnostic artifacts. Although dating by diagnostic artifacts is a
useful method for dating archaeological deposits some point types were used over long
periods of time, and the range of some tool forms are poorly defined. These factors and
considerations for the impacts of bio-pedoturbation on the Holocene depositional units
make their dating rather general at this time. Because charcoal preservation is so poor at
the site other methods such as dating bone collagen by AMS or dating sands by OSL
remain as productive ways to date the site and the Deweyville terrace. Both methods
have been used to good effect, and future OSL dating of the mantling sands will be
required in order to better understand the depositional processes that led to the formation

115

of the sandy mantle. Pedoturbation may hinder the interpretative value of OSL dating,
but advancing in interpreting OSL data and the application of the single grain method of
paleodose rates has the potential to not only provide more accurate dates, but potentially
measure the amount of pedoturbation that has occurred in the samples (Bateman et al
2003).
The understanding the soil formation processes and the depositional origin of the
Holocene deposits of the site and the terrace mantle would benefit from additional soil
chemistry, soil magnetism, isotopic studies, and micromorphological studies. A study of
the amount of organic carbon and phosphorous in the Holocene deposits may help define
the paleosols. Increases of organic carbon are shown to relate to the increase in organic
matter associated with buried soils (Frederick and Bateman 2004). Increased
concentration of phosphorous in archaeological sites has been shown to derive from
prehistoric cultural activities (Holliday 2004). Conducting studies of the magnetic
properties of the Holocene sediments may assist in identifying sediment sources (Lees
1999). Stable isotope studies of the bulk soil organic matter could provide data on
changes in vegetation types present through time on the slope and scarp of the terrace.
Finally scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies of grain morphology could help
with identifying sediment sources. Comparing grain morphology of the Holocene sands
to known fluvial and eolian sands could assist in determining the mode of transport,
though results could be inconclusive if the eolian sediments were transported only a
short distance. Most studies of eolian grain morphology are from sands that would have
experienced extensive eolian transport in arid desert environments (Tchakerian 1991).

116

This full suite of studies along with heavy mineral and elemental analyses was
undertaken at the Buckeye Knoll site (41VT98), however the results were often
contradictory (Frederick and Bateman 2004). Replicating some of the studies at the
McNeill-Gonzales site would further facilitate the comparison of these sites, and may
help resolve some of the contradictory results of their analyses.
The work at the terrace would benefit from additional geomorphic testing on the
Holocene floodplain adjacent to the site and deep cores to understand the relationship
between the Deweyville Terrace and the Beaumont Formation. Understanding the
Holocene floodplain would help with understanding the fluvial response to sea level
change during the Late Quaternary by identifying terraces that may be buried by
Holocene floodplain aggradation. It would also help discern the location and nature of
Holocene channel deposits, which would assist in evaluating the potential scenarios of
eolian deflation of floodplain deposits onto the Deweyville terrace.
Ultimately regional geomo rphic surveys of similar settings on other remnant
Deweyville Terraces will be required to determine the nature and extent of the Holocene
mantle on Deweyville Terraces. Archaeological deposits are buried in deposits of
Deweyville Terraces of the Guadalupe River and until a uniform theory can explain the
processes that buried these sites the site formation processes at this site will remain
uncertain. A cursory examination of site distributions along the lower Guadalupe River
shows that many prehistoric sites identified in the region are located on slopes and high
terraces along the margin of the Guadalupe River. A larger sample size of sites in
similar settings with geomorphic investigations, and a spatial analysis of site

117

distributions relative to geomorphic surfaces would provide valuable insight into site
preservation, site distribution, help future systematic archaeological investigations, and
the management of these archaeological resources.
Additional studies of materials recovered from excavations could contribute to
the understanding of site formation processes and paleoenvironment. Continuing studies
of artifact distributions through the profile based on artifact weight and size could
provide information on the impacts of bio-pedoturbation on the cultural stratigraphy of
the site. Vertical sorting of artifacts by size or weight may suggest that pedoturbation
decreased site integrity. The presence of diagnostic artifacts in good stratigraphic
context and intact features is evidence that bioturbation has not disturbed the
archaeological deposits to the degree where integrity is compromised. Faunal studies of
mussel and snail shells, as well as animal bones recovered would help in understanding
the local environments during the Holocene. Studying mussel and snail shell species
could provide important data on the behavior of the Guadalupe River by correlating the
environments that the modern mussel species live to the species found in the
archaeological record. Faunal remains from mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and fish
that were recovered from the excavations could provide a wealth of information on the
local environment during the Holocene due to changing distributions of species, as well
as changing dietary patterns of prehistoric peoples.
The understanding of the site stratigraphy and archaeological deposits would
benefit from additional excavations, and geoarchaeological studies. First, the age and
the nature of the archaeological deposits found the in the Paleo Area profile below the

118

colluvially reworked calcic horizon have not been adequately examined. Based on
stratigraphic studies these deposits could be Late Paleoindian or older and as of
publication there have been no excavations into the horizon that contain these deposits.
The Paleo Area needs a systematic excavation unit in an undisturbed portion of the site
to obtain a complete representation of the prehistoric deposits in the area. Test
excavations focused on the exposed earlier components of the site, and the later
components have not been examined. Test excavations of these components would help
relate the stratigraphy and archaeological deposits of this portion of the site to the other
portion. Though more Late Paleoindian artifacts were recovered in the Paleo Area than
anywhere else, it may not be the best part of the site to recover discrete Late Paleoindian
components. Significant mixing of Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic artifacts, the
position on a colluvial slope, significant clay illuviation, and the observations of
scattered artifact distributions suggest that this portion of the site has seen significant
mixing of archaeological components, artifact translocation, and post burial pedogenic
alteration. The deeply buried Late Paleoindian component of Excavation Area 4
indicates that this portion of the site may hold more intact Paleoindian deposits. The
Paleoindian component at this portion of the site was effectively sealed from later
disturbance by a palesol at the top of the unit. As opposed to being an occupation on a
slope these deposits are found in a slight depression on the edge of the terrace tread that
was buried through vertical aggradation as opposed to colluvial deposition. Though
some clay illuviation has occurred in this horizon it is far less pronounced than in the

119

Paleo Area. Based on the stratigraphic work it is estimated that an area of approximately
800 m2 may contain these deposits in the area around Excavation Area 4.
Artifacts from the Early to Middle Archaic are less common than the Late
Archaic/Late Prehistoric and the Late Paleoindian, but there are some locations where
deposits exist. First the burial in the Paleo Area is from the late Middle Archaic and
additional excavations could possibly identify more burials from this time period.
Considering that the archaeological record of the Middle Archaic is poorly understood
on the Coastal Plain and the interior Coastal Plain the burial and Middle Archaic
artifacts from Excavation Area 4 could provide needed information on this period of
prehistory (Ricklis 2004a). The timing of the paleosol development atop the Archaic
period deposits in the Paleo Area could be facilitated by additional excavation of the
Archaic components.
Finally the Late Archaic/Late Prehistoric occupations of the site could provide a
wealth of information on these prehistoric time periods. These periods have the greatest
density and distribution of artifacts, with middens and burials that date to this period.
The mixing of deposits during the late 2,500 years does complicate the interpretive value
of these deposits, but the sheer volume and wide distribution of artifacts is a compelling
reason for future studies. These levels have the best preservation of charcoal, shell, and
faunal material, which would further contribute to interpretations of subsistence patterns
and environmental setting. The Paleo Area is the only portion of the site where
significant deposits from these time periods have not been recovered. Targeted

120

excavations of midden deposits would be best served in the Anaqua Mott area, while
burials most likely still remain to be excavated in the Burial Areas of the Main Site Area.
Though much work has been done these suggestions show just how much work
is possible. I hope future investigations at the site will be facilitated by this
geoarchaeological research and that this research will contribute to and help stimulate
future geoarchaeological studies in the region.

APPENDIX D
POLLEN ANALYSIS

For this report sediment samples from one excavation unit profile were analyzed
to assess the potential for pollen preservation in the Holocene sands mantling the
Deweyville Terrace. The following report details the archaeological and ecological
context the samples were taken from, the methods used to process the sediment samples
for pollen analysis, and the analyses of the pollen data. This report finds pollen
preservation at this site is very poor and the potential does not exist to recover pollen in
quantities necessary to make paleoclimatic interpretations.
Site Context
The McNeill-Gonzales site is located in the Floodplains and Low Terraces
ecological sub-region along the Guadalupe River and the modern vegetation is
dominated by deciduous hardwoods along the edge of the terrace and a mixture of
graminoids and forbs on the terrace tread (Griffith et al 2004). The deciduous species
observed in the immediate vicinity of the site are Quercus, Prosopis, Carya, Celtis,
Ehretria elliptica, and Ulmus. The flowering forbs are typically Asteraceae, Lupinus,
Urticia, Solanum, Castilleja, Argemone, and numerous unidentified graminoids. The
region is considered a warm temperate climate, with a mean rainfall of 965 mm and a
mean temperature of 21.2Â°C. The mean wettest month is September, and the mean driest
month is March. The average last freeze of the spring is March 6th and the average first
freeze of the fall is November 12th (Miller 1979).

170

Samples were collected from Excavation Area 4, which has the most complete
record of Holocene sedimentation with chronological control. The west wall of unit
N397 E850 was sampled on July 9, 2004. The profile was cleaned before collection, and
samples were taken from the top and bottom of each stratigraphic unit using a trowel
cleaned with distilled water between each sample. Seven samples were collected from
this profile. A surface sample was collected from random grab samples collected across
the surface of the site area on March 13, 2005. All eight samples were collected in
plastic ziplock bags and were left untreated (Table D-1).

The sediments within the archaeological deposits are dark gray (10YR3/2)
organic rich loamy fine sands. The dark color may be due to decay of organics from the
increased biomass along the terrace edge, or the anthropic input of organics and human
wastes. Post-depositional disturbance by bio- and pedoturbation is common. There was

171

moderate to good recovery of bone and shell in the upper Holocene Unit Ic deposits, but
the abundance and presumably the preservation of these artifact types decreases with
depth. Charcoal was only observed in Unit Ic.
Expectations for Pollen Recovery
The expectations for recovering pollen from this context were low because the
environmental region and many variables at this site are not conducive to the
preservation of pollen. The Loma Sandia site (41LK28), which is found in a very
similar environmental and geological context as 41VT141, saw no recovery of pollen
from archaeological sediments (Jones and Sobolik 1995). Both the southern and eastern
portions of Texas are characterized as having poor pollen preservation, and there is an
almost nonexistent pollen record in this region (Bryant and Holloway 1985: 54, 60-61).
The frequent wetting and drying of the well drained sandy soils can cause the
degradation of pollen grains. Studies conducted by Holloway (1989) have shown that
repeated wetting and drying cycles, which occur in the warm-temperate climate of the
Gulf Coastal Plain, cause significant destruction of pollen through breakage, warping,
and corrosion of the pollen exine. Alkaline sediments, and soil formation processes such
as illuviation of clays and carbonates has the potential to damage pollen. There is the
potential for pollen recovery from high pH sediments, though pollen is typically in a
poor state of preservation (Bryant and Hall 1993). Though anthropogenic inputs to the
pollen record could contribute to the amount of pollen present at the site, deleterious
impacts of mechanical destruction by human activities should be considered as well.
Finally, biological activity is also an agent of pollen destruction. The relatively high

172

biomass along the terrace scarp, the warm temperatures, and moist climate are conducive
to the growth of bacteria and fungi, which have been shown to feed on pollen (Holloway
1989).
Processing Methods
Eight samples from the McNeil Gonzales site were processed. Seven samples
were selected to provide a representative sample of the potential for recovery of pollen
of each soil horizon and one surface sample was collected to provide data on the modern
pollen rain. Beginning on September 23, 2004 three samples were processed by the
author and Tim Riley. The remaining four samples were processed by author between
February 7 and 16, 2005. Samples were weighted before processing and two
Lycopodium 13,500 grain marker tablets were added to each sample. For the first three
samples 10 grams of sediment were processed. There was very minimal recovery of
pollen in these samples so it was decided to double the sample size in order to increase
the potential for pollen recovery. 30% HCl was added to each of the samples to dissolve
the Lycopodium tablets and carbonates. Additional water was added to dilute the HCl
and samples were then screened with 150 micron mesh screens. Samples were then
âswirledâ to reduce the amount of larger silicates in the sample. The supernatant was
collected and the heavy fraction was discarded. The supernatants were allowed to settle
overnight and the water was suctioned off. Unfortunately after the water was sucked off
the samples they were allowed to dry out. The samples were probably desiccated for 4
hours, and desiccation for any period of time has the potential to degrade pollen. Due to
increased clay content samples 3 and 7 were sonicated with a small amount of soap to

173

disaggregate the fine clay sediments, which releases pollen that is potentially trapped in
the sediments. These samples were then repeatedly washed in water and centrifuged to
remove the soap from the samples. All of the samples were then treated with 48% HF to
dissolve the remaining silicates. A small amount of HF was added to each of the
samples, which were then allowed to sit overnight. Water was then added to the samples
to dilute the HF. The samples were washed three times and allowed to settle for three
hours between washes. The samples were then transferred to centrifuge tubes and water
with a small amount of 1% KOH was added to each sample. Samples were then
repeatedly washed and centrifuged, and then transferred to 12 mL centrifuge tubes. The
next stage of sample preparation was acetolysis to remove cellulose from the sample,
and the use of KOH to remove humic acids. The KOH step was used on samples 1-3,
but it was accidentally not conducted on samples 4-7. The acetolysis process consisted
of first adding glacial acetic acid to the sample, then centrifuging and decanting the
supernatant. Then 5 mL of the 9:1 acetic anhydride: sulfuric acid acetolysis mixture is
added to each of the samples. The samples were then placed in the heating block for 8
minutes, and were frequently stirred. This process broke down the cellulose molecules.
Glacial acetic acid is then added to stop the chemical reaction and the samples were
centrifuged. The samples were washed with water repeatedly and centrifuged with 95%
alcohol to drive out any water. Samples were then treated with the Zinc Bromide
Procedure to separate the pollen grains from any remaining minerals. This procedure is
predicated on the differences in specific gravity of pollen and minerals. A ZnBr2
solution of a specific gravity of 2.0 causes the lighter 1.5 specific gravity pollen to float

174

to the top of the tube and the heavier silicates to sink to the bottom. Approximately 8
mL of ZnBr2 are added to each sample, as well as a small amount of water to the top of
the sample. The samples were centrifuged for 8 minutes and then the water and pollen
that had risen to the top of the solution were collected with a pipette. 50 mL of alcohol
was added to this supernatant and then the samples were centrifuged down and the
alcohol supernatant was discarded. Water and one drop of red stain was added to each
sample to stain the pollen. This was centrifuged once to set the stain. The samples were
then transferred to 1 dram vials and centrifuged once more to separate the alcohol that
was used in the process of transferring the sample from the test tube to the dram vial
from the pollen. The alcohol was decanted and three drops of glycerol were added to
each sample as a substrate. The samples were then left on the hot plate overnight to
dissolve the remaining alcohol. Slides were made for each sample and were examined
using light microscopes at 400X power. Tallies of all pollen and Lycopodium tracer
spores were made, and digital photographs of representative pollen grains and
questionable pollen grains were taken. Pollen types were compared to type collections
at the Texas A&M Palynology Lab, Knappâs guide (2000), and internet sources (Davis
2005).
Results
The results of the pollen count detailed in Table D-2 show a very poor recovery
of pollen from the archaeological samples. For the sake of time and due to the extremely
poor recovery it was decided to only count one slide for each of the samples. Sixteen
taxa were identified however the concentration values for the archaeological samples are

175

very low. Photographs identifying some of the taxa identified in the samples are found
in Figure D-1. While continuing to count more slides would probably increase the
number of taxa in the samples, the concentration values would still be too low to
consider these samples meaningful representations of paleoenvironments.
The surface sample had a very high percentage of Celtis, which may be a result
of the surface collection coinciding with its period of bloom. All of the taxa identified in
the surface sample are present in the area, except for Pinus. The pollen types identified
are all represented locally in the grass/forbs terrace tread and the riparian scarp of the
site area. Though Pinus is not present in the site area its presence is to be expected
considering it has such a wide area of dispersal and is grown ornamentally. The pollen
identified indicates a pollen spectrum not too different from the local vegetation, a
mixture of arboreal pollen associated with riparian environments, with grass and forbs
pollen from the open terrace tread and adjacent uplands.
The samples from the upper portion of the test unit (1 and 4) which correspond
Holocene Unit Ic (2,500 B.P. to present) have higher concentration values than the lower
deposits, though recovery was still very poor. Though there were a high number of
spores present in this sample, with the majority being Pucciniaceae sp. and an
unidentified Spheroid Dark Red Spore, the spores were not counted. These upper
samples were dirtier slides and Sample 1 still had a number of silicate grains, which
suggests the potential for error in processing. The number of spores decreased
dramatically with depth.

The pollen recovery from the lowest parts of the site was practically nil. The
samples from the intermediate portion of the site (2, 5, and 6) correspond to the
Holocene Unit Ib (7,500-2,500 B.P.). These samples had a marked reduction in spores,
and it can be assumed that the barrage of post-depositional processes had destroyed
much of the pollen record. The deepest samples which correspond to Holocene Unit Ia
(10,000-7,500 B.P.) had only the most minimal amount of pollen recovered, and
considering the development of a weak illuvial horizon this unit has experienced more
pedogenesis and weathering than the upper deposits.
Conclusions
The analysis of sediment samples found the potential for pollen recovery is
extremely low, and future pollen analyses at this site are not recommended. The
environmental setting is clearly not conducive to pollen preservation, but that does not
discount the utility of this exercise because it serves as a model for pollen preservation
for similar sites located in sandy sediments along alluvial terraces of the Gulf Coastal
Plain. One can certainly not rule out the potential for pollen to have been lost during
processing, especially since the sample dried out before the HF treatment. In
conclusion, analysis of these samples tested and confirmed the hypothesis that sandy
open sites in humid-temperate environments have poor pollen preservation and are
poorly suited for pollen analysis.

VITA

Michael John Aiuvalasit received his Bachelor of Arts Degree in archaeological
studies, anthropology, and history from The University of Texas at Austin in 2001.
During his time at UT he attended an archaeological field school in Belize and was an
assistant on a research project in Mexico directed by Dr. James Neely. Coursework in
geoarchaeology under Dr. Karl Butzer and fieldwork in Mexico along side Dr. Chris
Caran kindled his interest in geoarchaeology. After graduation he spent three years
working in cultural resource management for a number of private and university contract
archaeology firms in Texas and for the National Park Service in New Mexico. He
enrolled at Texas A&M University in the fall of 2003 and received his Masters of Arts
Degree in anthropology in May of 2006. During his time at Texas A&M he conducted
geoarchaeological research on a prehistoric hunter- gatherer site in Victoria Co., Texas;
large prehistoric water management features in the Tehuacan Valley, Puebla, Mexico;
and began a pilot study of gleaning environmental and geomorphic data from historical
documents of the Spanish mission period of Texas.
His research interests focus on geoarchaeological investigations, with specific
interests in archaeological site stratigraphy and modeling the distribution of
archaeological sites. He is conducting ongoing research in Texas and Mexico.
Mr. Aiuvalasit may be reached at 1901 Columbia Dr., Richardson, TX 75081.
