Abstract
In 1983, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department granted funds to
the Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at Austin, to
attempt to date prehistoric pictographs by radiocarbon assay of
remnant lichen bodies underlying and covering pictographs. The Red
Monochrome paintings in 41VV72, Seminole Canyon State Historical Park,
were selected from several sites with lichen growth because this style
is known to post-date A.D. 600. The radiocarbon dates generated from
the lichen samples were erratic, probably because of contamination
introduced by the metabolism of minerals from the parent rock and by
the presence of insoluble dolomite particles.
