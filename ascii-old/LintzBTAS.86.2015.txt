A Steatite Vessel Fragment from 41SS178, San Saba County,
Texas: Consideration of Late Prehistoric Connections
between the Northwestern and Southern Plains
Christopher Lintz and Daniel Prikryl

ABSTRACT
Archeological testing at 41SS178 in San Saba County, Texas, recovered a stone steatite vessel rim sherd from
Late Prehistoric contexts containing diagnostic arrow points from both Austin and Toyah phases and probably
dating between ca. A.D. 1000 and 1600. The scarcity of stone bowl technology and absence of comparable
steatite vessels from Texas suggests that the vessel was probably from a distant source. The inability to geochemically source steatite limits source identifications to vessel form comparisons. Prehistoric steatite vessels
are commonly made in three places in North America: the Appalachian Mountains in the Eastern United States
during Middle-Late Archaic times; the northwestern Plains during the Late Prehistoric through Historic times;
or the West Coast from Archaic through Late Prehistoric times. The vessel form and temporal context of the
San Saba County specimen suggests a closer relationship with the northwestern Plains than other areas. It
is postulated that the vessel arrived in Texas from the northwest as part of the same kinds of interaction that
brought some 115 northwestern Plains obsidian artifacts to the southern Plains.

INTRODUCTION
Recent testing to assess impacts to 41SS178 of
a proposed foot bridge over a tributary creek within
the Lower Colorado River Authority’s San Saba
River Nature Park recovered a small rim sherd of a
ground stone steatite vessel (Hixon et al. 2011:38).
The site is near the confluence of Mill Creek and
the San Saba River within the city limits of San
Saba, Texas. Prehistoric steatite artifacts from
Texas are rare and a soapstone vessel fragment
from Central Texas is unique. Herein we describe
the form and context of the stone vessel fragment
and examine the formation processes and occurrence of steatite. Geochemical sourcing studies of
steatite are in their early stages of development.
The range of geochemical variation of steatite
quarries from the three vessel manufacturing areas
in North America remains unknown. Comparative studies of archeological steatite vessel forms
in North America suggest that this vessel most
closely resembles those from the northwestern
Plains in shape and age. Its presence in a Central
Texas site is postulated to be related to the kinds
of interactions that occurred between aboriginal

groups with the transport of obsidian between the
northwestern and southern Plains during the Late
Prehistoric period.
DESCRIPTION
The vessel fragment is a small (1.80 x 1.62 cm)
piece of soft, silvery-gray steatite or soapstone with
a greasy or slick feel. The specimen measures 0.51
cm thick at the body portion furthest from the lip and
narrows to a thickness of 0.41 cm at a bevel juncture
point some 0.29 cm below the lip. At that point the
exterior edge of the vessel is markedly beveled to
form a nearly pointed rim. Prominent manufacturing striations parallel to the rim axis are present on
the interior surface. The exterior body has striations
perpendicular to the lip, while the exterior rim
bevel has abrasion marks parallel to the rim (Figure
1). The striation orientations suggest that the later
stages of vessel shaping were made with a coarse
abrading stone. A concentric circle chart indicates
that the vessel had a projected orifice diameter of
about 20 cm. This projected diameter suggests that
the sherd is from a bowl or cup, rather than a pipe or

smaller artifact. The vessel height is unknown, but
the rim slope from a plane perpendicular to the lip
axis indicates that the upper vessel body probably
had a relatively deep, conical form.
CONTEXT AND POSSIBLE CULTURAL
AFFILIATION OF THE SAN SABA,
TEXAS SPECIMEN
The specimen was recovered during screening
fill from Unit 2 South, level 2 (99.7-99.6 m below
datum point) at 41SS178 (Hixon et al. 2011:38).
The survey phase placed 17 shovel tests and two
backhoe trenches to delineate site limits of about
105 x 75 m, which is bounded on three sides by the
incised channel of Mill Creek. The testing phase
included two more backhoe trenches and three 1 x
2 m hand-excavated units excavated to depths of
1 m each. The northern half of the northernmost 1
x 2 m unit was subsequently excavated down an
additional 50 cm as was the southern half of the
southernmost 1 x 2 m unit.

Culturally and temporally diagnostic implements recovered during the testing phase include
two contracting stemmed Perdiz points (one each
from levels 1 and 2), three plainware pottery sherds
(one each from levels 1, 2, and 3) and four small,
stemmed or corner-notched arrow points loosely
resembling the corner-notched Scallorn type (two
from level 2, and one each from levels 3 and 7; Figure 2). Considerable morphological variation exists
in the range of point forms assigned to the Scallorn type from this site. They vary from minimally
modified corner-notched flakes to spike-like forms
with only slight shoulders and basal tangs. Based
on the distribution of these diagnostic projectile
points, the steatite vessel fragment was recovered
from the lower portion of a probable Toyah phase
component (ca. A.D. 1250-1600, as indicated by
Perdiz points and Leon Plain pottery) or the upper
portion of a probable Austin phase component (ca.
A.D. 1000-1250, as indicated by Scallorn points).
A charcoal sample from level 3 (20-30 cm
below surface), yielded a conventional age of
870 ± 40 B.P. (Beta-287767) and a calibrated two

standard deviation age range of A.D. 1040-1260 for
the zone below the fill containing the stone vessel
rim. Thus, the steatite vessel post-dates A.D. 1000
and is unquestionably associated with the Late Prehistoric period at the site (e.g., Collins 1995:385;
Prewitt 1981, 1985).
Although the site is only some 500 m from the
edge of town, less than a half dozen historic artifacts were recovered from 41SS178 from all phases
of the project. The scarcity of historic remains on
site suggests that the steatite stone bowl fragment
is not an intrusive 20th century artifact that has
worked its way into prehistoric subsurface contexts
by bioturbation processes.
STEATITE COMPOSITION
AND FORMATION
Steatite or soapstone is composed mostly of
talc, a hydrated magnesium silicate that naturally formed by one of two ways (Greene 1995:5;

Truncer 2004a:489). The more common manner
of formation involves the metamorphic alteration
of ultramafic rocks, such as periodite or other dark
mantle rocks rich in irons and magnesium but
low in silica. Typically these ultramafic rocks are
chemically altered during bedrock deformation
associated with heating in subduction zones by
plate tectonics. The less common way that steatite
forms is by hydrothermal chemical replacement
changes, or metasomatism, which adds chemicals
and silica and alters carbonate-rich sedimentary
rock, such as dolomite (Greene 1995:5; Truncer
2004a 489). Steatite derived from altered periodite
forming near tectonic boundaries sometimes contain ubiquitous microscopic inclusions of chromite
and nickel sulfides and from one to three percent of
iron oxides; whereas steatite formed from hydrothermic changes of dolomites do not contain these
sulfides, and usually have less than one percent
iron oxide (Jim Burton, personal communication
2011; Greene 1995:10). These differences make it
possible to differentiate between the two forms of

134

steatite. Steatite is very soft, measuring only 1.0
on the Mohs hardness scale. It is easily cut and
ground into a variety of forms with simple implements. One advantage of the metamorphic kind of
steatite is that it is resistant to thermal shock, and
it functions well as fire-proof cooking containers.
Few geological talc-bearing districts occur in
Arkansas (n=1), Texas (n=2), and New Mexico
(n=1) of the south-central United States (Greene
1995). The closest reported source of steatite to
41SS178 is about 72 km from San Saba near the
southern margin of the Precambrian Llano Uplift or
Central Texas Mineral Belt (Beste 2005:395; Figure 3). As many as 17 soapstone mining prospects
have been geologically mapped for the region, with
most occurring along the southern part of the Llano
Uplift and with serpentine occurrences associated
with Packsaddle schist (Dietrich and Lonsdale
1958; Green 1995:65). These steatite outcrops
are generally small, non-commercial, exposures
of ocean floor serpentine that has been altered by
metamorphism and the heat from intrusive igneous rocks and conform to the ultramarfic type of
steatite formation processes (Barnes et al. 1950).
Modern commercial soapstone and talc mines
are present along the Allamoore Formation exposed
near the south end of the Sierra Diablo Mountains

about 16 km west of Van Horn, in Hudspeth and
Culbertson counties, and some 585 km west of San
Saba, Texas (Bourbon 1982; King 1965; King and
Flawn 1953). Here a series of at least 20 mines
and 23 prospects of steatite and talc outcrop in
a 24 km long segment of the formation derived
from altered sedimentary rocks (Greene 1995:63).
Large-scale commercial mining of these deposits
began in 1952, and by 1994 about 8,880,000 tons
have been mined from the Allamoore Formation
quarries (Greene 1995:65).
The earliest geological survey of Texas reported other occurrences of impure “soapstone
deposits” from Frio, Bandera, and either Bexar
or Kendall counties (Dumble 1889:61). However,
since none are associated with igneous or metamorphic regions or known talc-deposits, their identifications as steatite sources are regarded as unlikely
(Greene 1995; Swanson 1995).
SOAPSTONE ARTIFACTS FROM
ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES IN TEXAS

A search of the Texsite Atlas electronic database found a few reported soapstone or steatite
artifacts attributed to two groups (Figure 4). First
are late 19th or early 20th century
historic soapstone utilitarian or
decorative ware artifacts that include a soapstone pencil, a tailor’s
seam-marking bar, and a sherd
from a decorative soapstone urn,
bowl, or ashtray from historic
homesteads in Atascosa, Bell, and
Marion counties.
The second soapstone group
consists of legitimate prehistoric
artifacts that occur as pendants
and pipes. Soapstone pendants are
reported from two sites in Presidio
and Brewster counties south of the
Allamoore Formation deposits in
far West Texas. The rare occurrences
of prehistoric soapstone pipes are
reported from Central and South
Texas. Two steatite elbow pipes
have been reported from Burnet
and Bosque counties northeast of
the Llano Uplift soapstone sources
region of Central Texas (Field
1956:172; Olds 1965:129). The

specimen from Burnet County has an outward facing anthropomorphic head carved in the bowl which
may represent an indigenous copy of European trade
pipes. Two tubular or conical pipes are reported
from Uvalde and Live Oak counties in South Texas
(Brown et al. 1982; Chandler 1995:10; Texas Beyond
History 2005). These kinds of pipes are sometimes
called cloud-blower forms and are commonly found
in northern Mexico and South Texas westward to
El Paso, Southern Arizona, and beyond (Switzer
1969:27-34). The orifice diameters of the two South
Texas steatite pipes range from 2.5-3 cm to 6.4 cm,
which is considerably smaller than the projected 20
cm diameter of the San Saba vessel fragment.
The Texsite files also list four other steatite
or soapstone specimens attributed to prehistoric
contexts. Unfortunately they are not described, but
merely listed as two pieces of worked steatite found
in Jasper and Navarro counties, an unmodified piece
of steatite from Panola County, and a “soapstone
abrader” from Nueces County. Unless the abrader is a
socio-technic item that represents a ritualistic artifact
based on the selection of an overly-soft, non-utilitarian material to absurdly represent a metaphor for
heavy-duty work implements (cf. Brown 1976:148),
the raw material attributed to the abrading stone is
probably misidentified in the database.
A search of the Texsite database for the occurrence of ground stone bowls turned up several
examples of mortar holes, but no reported examples
of portable stone vessels. One shallow stone bowl

not yet in the Texsite database and made from a nonsteatite rock was recovered during the 2013 Texas
Archeological Society field school from a Late Archaic component at the Eagle Bluff site (41ME147)
in Medina County. Illustration of the fragmentary
specimen shows the vessel to be a small (ca. 6.5
cm diameter), shallow, dish-shaped bowl (Hester
2013:12 and Figure 17). The differences in vessel
form, lithic resource material, and age from the San
Saba specimen clearly show that it was not part of the
same stone vessel manufacturing tradition.
In summary, steatite artifacts are rarely recovered
from prehistoric contexts in Texas. Most identifiable
prehistoric steatite implements from Texas are confined to jewelry or pipes. No comparable steatite stone
bowls have been reported from Texas, and indeed, no
sustained stone bowl manufacturing industries were
extant in Texas or the southern Plains. Based on the
absence of comparable kinds of artifacts, the solitary
San Saba steatite vessel was probably not made in
Texas. So the question remains: what is the probable source of the steatite vessel rim sherd found at
41SS178 in San Saba County?
OCCURRENCE OF STEATITE
OUTCROPS IN VESSELS: EASTERN
NORTH AMERICA
The distribution of talc, and related minerals—
steatite/soapstone, and serpentine deposits—in

136

Texas Archeological Society

North America as summarized by Greene (1995)
and Truncer (2004a) reflects high densities of
bedrock exposures in primarily three geographical
areas (Figure 5 a-b). These include:
1.

approximately 135 talc-deposit districts occur in the Appalachian Mountain range extending from east-central
Alabama northeastward through 15
states and the District of Columbia to
southwestern Maine;

2.

approximately 32 main talc districts
across the Sierra Nevada, Coastal, and
Cascade Mountain ranges of California, western Nevada, southwestern
and northeast Oregon, and across
Washington state; and

3.

approximately 14 main talc districts in
the northwestern Great Plains, mostly
in the Yellowstone and surrounding
mountainous areas of Wyoming,
southwestern Montana, and eastcentral Idaho.

Less common are relatively small talc and
related materials districts in the Superior region of
Wisconsin, the Ouachita Mountains of west-central
Arkansas, the Llano Uplift of Central Texas, the
basin and range areas of the Texas Trans-Pecos,
and the San Andrea Mountains of south-central
New Mexico. Of all these outcrop occurrences,
aboriginal stone bowl industries utilizing steatite/
soapstone are present only in the three main areas.
The age and style of vessel morphology differs to
a great degree from one area to another. The following briefly summarizes the steatite stone bowl
manufacturing industries to isolate temporal and
form characteristics that are comparable to the
example found in San Saba County.
Occurrence of Steatite Vessels: Appalachian
Mountains of Eastern North America
Along the East Coast/Appalachian Mountains
area, more than 50 of the 135 geological talcdeposit districts have documented quarries used
for the manufacture of steatite bowls. These prehistoric quarries extend across east-central Alabama,
northern Georgia, the western margins of both
North and South Carolina, western Virginia, central
Maryland, southeast Pennsylvania, as well as Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts (Truncer

2004a:489, 2004b, 2006). Other New England
steatite outcrops in Vermont, New Hampshire, and
Maine were not used as vessel quarries. Truncer
(2004a:490) postulates that steatite vessel quarries
correlate to the distribution of nut mast-dominated
woodlands, whereas the steatite outcrops not associated with stone vessels coincide with conifer/
hardwood forests with low mast yields. Truncer
also maintains that vessels made from the metamorphic form of steatite are used to process nuts
due to their superior ability to withstand heat.
Crushed steatite was among the earliest kinds of
pottery tempers used in the Mid-Atlantic states,
and its ability to stand up to high temperatures was
undoubtedly one of its desirable attributes (Griffin
1952:Figure 21).
The range of artifacts made of steatite in the
Eastern United States includes pipes, figurines, and
cooking vessels (Figure 6 a-c). Since most steatite
vessel fragments are small, the range of vessel
forms is uncertain. Some stone vessels are largemouth, rectangular-to-oval bowls with flat bottoms
and occasional lug handles and/or rare surface decorations (Tuck 1978:38; Griffin 1952:Figures 21,
138, 147). Other steatite cooking utensils are perforated flat griddle-like containers (Custer 1989).
In the Eastern United States, steatite vessel
fragments are usually found as isolated fragments
within 550 km of the nearest outcrop source, although some fragments from southern Florida are
about 950 km from the closest bedrock outcrop
(Truncer 2004a:490 and Figure 2). Abundant stone
vessel sherds have been reported from sites in eastern Tennessee, western South Carolina, southern
Virginia, southeast Pennsylvania, and Connecticut
within 125 km of the steatite outcrops. Some of
these sites may contain multiple steatite vessel
fragments found in graves, caches (non-graves),
and in habitation refuse (Truncer 2004a:495).
Caches of steatite vessel fragments are known
to occur only in the lower Mississippi River valley—especially at Claiborne in south Mississippi
(Gagliano and Webb 1970), and Poverty Point in
northeast Louisiana (Gibson 1996, 2001; Webb
1944, 1982). At the latter site, a single oval pit
southwest of the big mound yielded thousands
of soapstone vessel fragments. No complete or
restorable vessels were recovered and only a
few refit sherds were present from this context
(Gibson 1996). However, sherds from the pit conjoined other fragments from ridge-top locales up
to 1.2 km away from the Poverty Point site. Both

Texas specimen is about 1,150 km from the closest

thermoluminescence dates from Eastern U.S.
contexts yielding steatite vessel fragments indicate vessel usage from ca. 4300 B.C. to 50 B.C.
during the Middle and Late Archaic periods, with
most fragments dating between 2100 B.C. and
500 B.C. (Truncer 2004a:496-506). The earliest
stone vessels predate the occurrence of pottery,
but considerable temporal overlap exists in the two
technologies (Sassaman 2006). The persistence of
stone and ceramic vessel technologies reinforces
the notion that steatite vessels may have operated
in a different functional or symbolic realm from
that of pottery containers, perhaps due to differences in cooking temperatures, or porosity.
Occurrence of Steatite Vessels:
Northwestern Great Plains
of North America
Geologists have identified at least 14 steatite
or talc-bearing districts in the northwestern Plains,
including 12 ultramarfic sources in Wyoming, one
ultramarfic source from Idaho, and one carbonate source from Montana (Greene 1995). At least
seven steatite vessel quarries have been found in
the Laramie, Big Horn, Wind River, Gros Ventre,
and Teton Mountain ranges of Wyoming (Adams
2006:Figure 1; Frison 1982; Wedel 1954; see Figure 5b). Some steatite vessel quarries have partially
delineated vessel preforms, stubs of successfullyremoved vessel blanks, split vessel fragments,
stone choppers to rough-out container preforms,
and scrapers thought to have been used to hollow
out the bowls (Frison 1982). The final vessel shaping usually occurred at sites away from the quarry
sources. The northwestern Plains steatite vessel
industries are about 1,360 km from the San Saba,
Texas specimen.
Frison (1982:282) documents 11 steatite vessels from Wyoming. The typical northwestern
Plains vessel shapes are dominated by: tall “flower-pot” conical vessels with flat, flanged bases,
hemispherical bowls, and cup-like vessels. Some
conical vessel rims curve inward slightly and lips
range from rounded, flattened, or pointed (Frison
1982:281). Many vessels have a small notch-like
dimple along the rim to facilitate pouring (see
Figure 6). Very few vessels are decorated. Two
Wyoming vessels have a raised collar or band below their rims. The interior surfaces tend to show
more care in manufacture than the rough-scratched
and abraded exterior surfaces. The dimensions

139

of 11 relatively complete vessels range from 7.1
to 25.2 cm tall, 9.5 to 23.8 cm in diameter at the
orifice/rim, and 5.5 by 14.5 cm in diameter at the
base. Although vessel walls often ranged from 8.6
to 10.5 cm thick, on some vessels, the walls may
have areas ground to less the 0.2 cm thick, and
some even have holes worn through their walls.
Rarely drill holes are placed on opposite sides of
the vessel to facilitate carrying; and occasionally
paired drilled holes along a crack allowed damaged
vessels to be sewn and stabilized.
The greatest occurrence of steatite vessel
fragments is from northwestern Wyoming, Idaho,
and Montana (Frison 1982:283, 285). Vessel fragments are occasionally found on the foothills of the
Bighorn, Beartooth, Absaroka, Washakie, Teton,
Gros Ventre, Owl Creek, Wind River, Rattlesnake,
Seminoe, and Salt River Mountain ranges. Some
vessel fragments occur above timberline elevations, but most fragments are from lake shorelines
and mountain passes.
Both Frison (1982) and Wedel (1954) suggest that most steatite vessels probably date to the
early Historic period, for stone pots are mentioned
among early historic descriptions of Shoshonean
groups by Lewis and Clark (Schoolcraft 1851;
Thwaites 1904-05; Lowie 1924). Vessels are
also archeologically associated with bison horn
sheaths and projectile point forms attributed to
the historic period. The morphological similarity
of steatite vessels to conical, flat-bottom ceramic
vessels of the Intermountain Tradition suggests
there may be a cultural connection between them,
if not continuity in form. The conical ceramic
vessel form has been radiocarbon-dated as early
as A.D. 1100-1200 and persisted for perhaps 500
years (Frison 1982:284). Only 22 of 195 recorded
soapstone bowls are from Late Prehistoric contexts
(A.D. 1000-1500), whereas 30 vessels have metal
implement manufacturing marks suggesting that
stone bowl production persisted into the early A.D.
1800s Adams (2006:534).
Occurrence of Steatite Vessels:
Western North America
Steatite bowls are widespread and common
in the far West and extend from the Arctic, the
Northwest Coast, and throughout California (Adams 2006). Geologically, talc-producing districts
in the lower coterminous United States include
18 in California, three in Nevada, one in Oregon,

140

Texas Archeological Society

and 10 in Washington (Greene 1995; see Figure
5). More than two-thirds are ultramarfic forms,
but carbonate forms of steatite are also present,
especially along the Sierra Nevada Mountains
outcrop exposures.
The types of vessels commonly found in the
Arctic consist of small, relatively flat bowls that
served as oil lamps (Fitzhugh and Crowell 1988;
Willey 1966). The Northwest Coast groups historically made elaborately carved vessels of argillite
for the tourist trade. But prehistoric soapstone
manufacturing industries in the Northwest Coast
began as early as 5,000 years ago and produced
lip ornaments, ear spools, pendants, and other
jewelry rather than stone bowls or other containers
(Dahm 1994). Most of these steatite objects are too
far away to be seriously considered as a possible
source of the San Saba, Texas, vessel fragment.
Prehistoric manufacture of steatite ollas,
bowls, and tray-like vessels were common and
widespread across California (Adams 2006; Heizer
and Treganza 1944, 1972; Wlodarski 1979). Flat
tray-like drip pans for collecting cooking grease
were made near the Klamath River basin in northern California, and tall cylindrical jars were made
in the Stockton-Lodi area of the central interior valley (see Figure 6). One of the more famous steatite
olla manufacturing areas is Santa Catalina Island,
located some 1,850 km away from the San Saba
specimen from Central Texas (Wlodarski 1979).
Carved olla technology began about 4,000 years
ago, but the most intensive stone bowl production,
involving trade into the interior San Joaquin valley
and Sierra foothills, occurred during the Late Prehistoric period. Even though basketry was highly
developed, the steatite vessel industry supplied
products primarily used for supplemental cooking.
The common vessel forms are globular ollas,
wide mouth hemispherical bowls, asymmetrical
bowls, and flat griddle plates with low rims and
a drilled hole used to assist dragging the plates
from fires. Steatite was also commonly shaped into
jewelry and effigy charms with inlayed shell beads.
THE STATUS OF STEATITE
GEOCHEMICAL SOURCING STUDIES
The range of parent materials altered by either
thermal subduction or hydrothermal chemical replacements are expected to reflect great chemical
variations within steatite outcrops, so extensive

testing of sources is required to document their
chemical perimeters at any source area (Kenneth Sassman, personal communication, 2011).
Pioneering geochemical studies examined trace
elements (TE) and rare earth elements (REE) to
quantitatively characterize steatite source differences using a variety of methods. Early spectrographic steatite studies lacked precision and robust
sample sizes necessary to yield conclusive results
(Bullen and Howells 1943). Other investigations
tried combined atomic absorption and optical mineralogy techniques (Turnbaugh and Keifer 1979;
Turnbaugh et al. 1984). Still other studies used
Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA)
to measure REE abundances and delineate source
differences (Allen et al. 1975, 1984; Holland et
al. 1981; Luckenbach et al. 1975; Rogers et al.
1983). These studies had hoped that TE and REE
concentrations would remain relatively constant
across lateral occurrences of a steatite outcrop,
even though drastic changes may occur in overall
mineralogy (Allen and Pannell 1978). But the
REE occurrences among metamorphically-altered
mineral components proved to be relatively low
and bordered on the lower levels of instrument
measurements using INAA procedures (Allen et
al. 1984; Frey 1984).
Some outcrops were found to have tremendous
variations within a single source exposure. Other
researchers using radiochemical separation-INAA
on REE and ultramafic complexes found wide
and inconsistent variation in rare earth elements
from intra-source samples (Moffat and Butler
1986). Model mineralogy involving petrographic
studies of bulk steatite samples can yield very
heterogeneous results within a single source area,
reflecting an uneven distribution of TE and REE
concentrations over short distances even within a
quarry. Clearly to overcome these variances, large
bulk samples would have to be ground and well
mixed, resulting in the inevitable destruction of
artifacts to obtain comparative sourcing geochemical results. Thus, alternate avenues of analysis were
needed to overcome this undesirable consequence
of investigations.
One attempt to advance the analysis involved
using INAA combined with microprobe sampling
points on 400 unground steatite samples from eight
Appalachian quarries coupled with multivariate
statistics used to investigate an expanded range of
target elements to include TE, REE, minor trace elements, and transition metals (Truncer et al. 1998).

Lintz and Prikryl—A Steatite Vessel Fragment from 41SS178, San Saba County, Texas
The results suggested that rare earth elements were
less useful than relying on transitional metals in
differentiating sources at a regional level, but possibly not at the quarry level.
Other researchers explored the use of expanded
elemental lists employing results from INAA and
Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectometry
(ICP-MS) (Jones et al. 2007). The combination of
the two analytical approaches increased the confidence of REE concentration measurements over the
use of INAA alone based on the study of soapstone
source samples from Shetland, England. However,
identification on critical TE, REE, and transitional
metals to differentiate quarries remains elusive.
Other approaches have investigated the use
of basic electron microprobes analysis (EMPA)
to characterize fundamental mineral composition,
chemistry, and textural variations between steatite
sources (Ige and Swanson 2008). The microprobe
application has tremendous advantages over the
mixed bulk chemistry approach by being able to
recognize specific mineral compositions within
samples.
Building on these studies, Radko (2011) used
traditional thin section point counts to characterize
the modal and textural variability from samples
derived from 10 artifacts and three quarries. He
then employed both electron microprobes and xray diffraction methods to examine the constituent
chemical compositional data of the talc, chlorite,
oxide, and amphibole (dark-colored chain silicate
mineral) components of steatite samples from both
quarry and artifact specimens. Applying multivariate statistics to the data resulted in the identification of low calcium amphibole and titanium-iron
oxides (ilmenites) as the specific minerals that
best segregated the quarries and provided strong
correlations with the artifact samples.
Despite these encouraging results, considerably more work needs to be completed on many
more quarries throughout the United State before
the full utility of geochemical methods is developed for identifying steatite quarry sources for
specific artifacts. Unfortunately, the lack of comparable geochemical studies using broad suites of
metals, and REE for the Wyoming, most California, and known Texas steatite sources, hinders the
ability to correlate the San Saba, Texas, sample to
known steatite outcrops. This lack of an existing
comparative steatite database was the primary
reason for not pursuing geochemical studies on the
vessel fragment from San Saba, Texas.

DISCUSSIONS:
POSSIBLE NORTHERN-SOUTHERN
PLAINS INTERACTIONS
The foregoing survey suggests that steatite is
a naturally-occurring soft rock used by prehistoric
people to make mostly charms, ornaments, pipes,
and occasionally cooking vessels. Steatite cooking
vessels may have been independently invented
multiple times and places in North America. The
manufacture of stone vessels from the Eastern
United States developed during the Middle Archaic
period but persisted alongside the manufacture and
use of clay ceramic vessels. Stone vessels on the
West coast were also made during the Archaic and
persisted into the Late Prehistoric period. The stone
vessels on the northwest Plains developed during
the Late Prehistoric and persisted into Historic
periods (ca. A.D. 1000 to 1850).
Based on the lip form and projected orifice diameter, the steatite rim sherd from San Saba County,
Texas, appears to be most similar to the shape and
size of soapstone vessels from western Wyoming
(Adams 2006; Frison 1982). While many of the
Wyoming vessels are attributed to Protohistoric Numic and Historic Shoshonean groups, a few steatite
vessel fragments have been found in Late Prehistoric
contexts, and indicate the technology has sufficient
time-depth to have been contemporaneous with the
age of the San Saba County specimen.
The Texas rim form example and temporal
context is unlike the forms and ages of steatite
vessels from Archaic contexts in Eastern United
States (Truncer 2004a) and California/West Coast
regions (Wlodarski 1979). The vessel rim form
most closely resembles the deep flower-pot vessel shapes and general ages of stone vessels from
the northwestern Plains. We postulate that the San
Saba specimen was carried about 1,360 to 1,900
km to Central Texas from some steatite outcrop
sources in central or western Wyoming. These
northwestern Plains steatite sources are about 20
to 66 percent farther from 41SS178 than the closest
Southeastern U.S. Appalachian steatite source in
Alabama. But the distance to Wyoming is comparable to the distance to the nearest reported steatite
sources in southern California.
As discussed above, no geochemical characterization methods have been used to identify the origin
for the stone vessel from 41SS178 due to the lack
of comparative source deposit data, especially from
Texas, the northwestern Plains, and the West Coast.

Texas Archeological Society
THE NORTHWEST-SOUTHERN
PLAINS OBSIDIAN CONNECTION

So what is such a rare and exotic stone bowl
doing so far from the northwestern Plains in prehistoric times? The archeological record suggests
that this steatite vessel fragment is not the only
artifact reflecting probable connections between
the northwestern Plains and Texas. An opportunistic compilation of reported sourced obsidian
maintained by the senior author indicates at least
41 artifacts from 25 Texas sites are attributed to
two obsidian sources in the same general area as
the northwestern Plains steatite outcrops (Baugh
and Nelson 1987; Hester et al. 1986; Kibler 2005).
Most Texas obsidian specimens derived from the
northwestern Plains are from the Malad source
in southeast Idaho (n=39 artifacts from 23 Texas
sites), but smaller frequencies are also sourced
to Obsidian Cliff, in northwest Wyoming (n=2
artifacts from two Texas sites). While it may seem
that the two Obsidian Cliff source pieces are occurrence anomalies, when obsidian sourcing studies are expanded to include sourced obsidian from
Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas, no fewer than five
different northwestern Plains obsidian sources are
present on the southern Plains as represented by
115 artifacts from 71 archeological sites (Tables 1
and 2). The northwestern Plains obsidian sources
are generally located northwest of the Wyoming
steatite quarries, and movements of obsidian from
this region to the southern Plains would have
passed within a few score kilometers of the northwestern Plains steatite quarries (Figure 7).
The northwestern Plains sources represent
between 9.3 and 18.5 percent of the identified
reported sourced obsidian in the database from
Kansas (34 of 285 pieces; 11.9 percent), Oklahoma (40 of 216 pieces; 18.5 percent) and Texas
(41 of 443 pieces; 9.3 percent). Whereas volcanic
glass artifacts from Obsidian Cliff, Wyoming,
are comparatively rare in Texas (n=2), 21 other
pieces from this source area have been found in
greater abundance in Oklahoma and Kansas. The
combined sources from Malad, Idaho (n=85; 73.9
percent), and Obsidian Cliffs, Wyoming (n=27;
23.5 percent), account for 97.4 percent of all the
recorded northwestern Plains obsidian sources in
the three state southern Plains database. Three
other northwestern Plains obsidian sources are
represented by two temporally undiagnostic flakes
and a Late Paleoindian projectile point recovered

from two sites in the Oklahoma panhandle and one
site in western Oklahoma. Single obsidian flakes
from Owyhee, Idaho, and Teton Pass (also known
as Fish Creek), Wyoming, sources are from the
central and eastern counties in the Oklahoma panhandle, and a Scottsbluff point most likely made
from Wright Creek obsidian outcropping near the
Obsidian Cliffs source was recovered from Washita
County in west-central Oklahoma.
The five northwestern Plains obsidian sources
are located about 1850 to 2000 km from the San
Saba, Texas, site, and are generally northwest of the
seven steatite stone vessel quarries found in various
mountain ranges in Wyoming (Adams 2006). Any
direct or indirect movement of obsidian from these
sources would pass close to a number of steatite
outcrops in Wyoming, which range from 1300 to
1800 km from the San Saba, Texas, locality.
The nature of the interaction is indicated by
the kinds of artifacts made of northwestern Plains
obsidians on the southern Plains. Of the 115 obsidian artifacts, only 21 (18.3 percent) are identifiable
tools. These include 12 projectile points, six biface
fragments, one scraper, and two unifaces. The nontool assemblage consists of one core and 72 flakes;
the latter most likely represent tool manufacture or
maintenance activities. An additional 21 artifacts
have not been identified as to type. Overall, the
northwestern Plains artifact assemblage is characteristic of a generalized hunting tool kit and does not
reflect exotic status items, such as eccentrics pieces.
This is not unexpected as the foreign obsidian in
Texas occurs primarily among the relatively mobile
hunter-gatherer band level groups in Central Texas.
These people were probably organized around extended family ties, rather than elite headmen/chiefs
requiring symbols of office and power.
The age of the southern Plains-northwestern
Plains interaction is inferred directly from temporally diagnostic artifacts made from northwestern
Plains obsidian, and indirectly from ascribed cultural affiliation of the sites yielding the obsidian materials based on presumed associations with other kinds
of temporally diagnostic materials. Although the
widths of hydration rims absorbed on the surface of
obsidian was once touted as being a possible direct
dating method, further research has identified issues
making the method problematic (cf. Miller 1996).
Of the dozen projectile points made of northwestern Plains obsidian sources, four (33 percent)
are either unspecified or too fragmentary for identification. One specimen from western Oklahoma

the most intense interaction period
between ca. 1000 and 2000 years ago.
This temporal range of interaction based on only a dozen artifacts
is mirrored by the cultural affiliations ascribed to sites containing the
obsidian artifacts (Table 3). Solitary
northwestern Plains obsidian artifacts
have been reported from single sites
assigned to the Late Paleoindian and
the Early/Middle Archaic periods.
Five obsidian artifacts are from generalized Archaic period sites which
provide little indication of which
millennia are represented. However,
based on assigned site affiliations,
more regular contacts between the
northwestern and southern Plains began in the Late or Transitional Archaic
and intensified throughout the Late
Prehistoric I (Woodland) and II (Village) periods. This pattern is indicated
by 17 obsidian artifacts (14.8 percemt)

Late Prehistoric period sites artifacts,
the 23 artifacts (20.0 percent) from

with northwestern Plains obsidian from a single
source, and the other six have sites with multiple
northwestern Plains obsidian sources. Not a single
one of the 12 counties with multiple sites have artifacts from different northwestern Plains sources,
even though some, such as Odessa Yates in Oklahoma, have artifacts from New Mexican or other
Southwestern obsidian sources (Brosowske 2004,
2005, 2006). This lack of multi-sourced northwestern obsidian found at single sites suggests
that the obsidian moved as single-source package
units, rather than from the amassing of samples
from northwestern Plains sources before being
transported to the southern Plains, or the meeting
of various northwestern Plains groups with access
to different obsidian sources in rendezvous places
on the southern Plains.
Figure 8 compares the density distribution of
all obsidian in the current data compilation relative

to the frequency and percent per county of the
combined northwestern Plains obsidian across
Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. A comparison of the
distribution of the entire obsidian database against
either of the two maps showing the northwestern
Plains obsidian frequency and percent shows that the
southern high plains of Texas has been well sampled
for sourced obsidian. Yet, except for the Oklahoma
panhandle region, the northwestern Plains obsidian
rarely occurs on the short grass plains of western
Kansas or Texas. The paucity of obsidian in the
western counties may suggest that northwestern
Plains obsidian found in Central and South Texas
sites does not reflect the kinds of material density
drop-off that might be from down-the-line economic
models of obsidian traded from one group to the
next. Instead, the frequency distribution south of
Kansas shows the northwestern Plains obsidian to
be concentrated along the counties of the Oklahoma

obsidian in the southern Plains.

Lintz and Prikryl—A Steatite Vessel Fragment from 41SS178, San Saba County, Texas
panhandle and along the Balcones Escarpment/
Central Texas Hill country.
In Kansas and Oklahoma, the northwestern
obsidian artifacts are scattered in counties with
low frequencies across the tall grass prairies and
woodlands of central and eastern Kansas and
Oklahoma (see Figure 8). However, when the
percentage of northwestern Plains obsidian per
county is considered, the highest percentage of
northwestern Plains obsidian in Kansas and Oklahoma is perhaps surprisingly located in the eastern
and northeastern counties within these states, rather
than in the northwestern counties closest to the
obsidian outcrop sources. Indeed the counties in
western Oklahoma and Kansas have low to moderate percentages of northwestern Plains obsidians,
which reflect the occurrences of moderate amounts
of obsidian from New Mexican and other Southwestern sources. In light of the periods of obsidian

151

occurrences on the southern Plains, it has been
suggested that the low frequency/high percentage
occurrence in the northeastern parts of Kansas
perhaps reflects the southwestern spread of these
exotic kinds of obsidian from the Hopewellian and
Oneota interaction sphere(s) of Ohio, Illinois, and
Iowa (Griffin et al. 1969; Hatch et al. 1990; Hughes
1992, 1995; Roper 2000). However, due to the
paucity and distribution of counties in Texas with
high percentages of northwestern Plains obsidian,
a different source route may be operating in Texas.
When the distributions of the obsidian from
each northwestern source area are plotted, other
patterns emerge (Figure 9). As previously discussed, Malad and Obsidian Cliffs obsidians dominate the distribution of northwestern Plains types
across the southern Plains. Malad is abundantly
represented across all three states, especially in
Central Texas, the Oklahoma panhandle, and west

Figure 9. Distribution of Malad, Obsidian Cliff, and minor other obsidian sources in the southern Plains.

central Oklahoma proper and across central and
northeastern Kansas. In contrast, Obsidian Cliffs
obsidian occurs across the northern tiers of counties in the Oklahoma panhandle and Oklahoma
proper, and in a few counties in Kansas; it is very
rarely present in Texas.
The most insightful information pertains to
the distribution of minor obsidian sources, where
Owyhee and Teton Pass/Fish Creek obsidian occurs in the Oklahoma panhandle, and the Wright
Creek obsidian occurs in western Oklahoma. The
absence of these minor source obsidians in northeastern Kansas and Oklahoma where low frequencies, but high percentages, of northwestern Plains
obsidians occur suggest that they are not linked
to Malad or Obsidian Cliff obsidian movements
from Idaho and northwestern Wyoming into the
Missouri and Mississippi river valleys.Their
presence in the Oklahoma panhandle and western
Oklahoma is derived from routes and movement
mechanisms other than the spread of materials along the Hopewellian/Oneota interaction
sphere(s). The high incidence of obsidian across
the Oklahoma panhandle and across northern
Oklahoma may reflect routes southward along the
Trapper’s/Cherokee Trial along the eastern side of
the Rocky Mountains and then eastwards along
the Picuris/Taos/Osage trail across the Great Salt
Plain in northwestern Oklahoma (Ferring et al.
1976:36-45; Foreman 1925; Lecompte 1986:67;
McDermott 1940:250, 272).
The correlation of Malad obsidian artifacts
with 10 Central Texas counties along the Balcones
Escarpment has long been recognized (Hester et al.
1986; Kibler 2005). But the significance of these
patterns remains uncertain. Undeniably, the Balcones Escarpment is a region with an abundance
of springs and a tremendous habitat diversity that
is unique for conditions on the Plains (Kay 1998).
The paucity of northwestern Plains obsidian southeast of the Balcones Escarpment might reflect the
extent of northwestern prehistoric Plains people
drawn to this moderately unique habitat within the
Plains region. Alternatively, the obsidian occurrence in Central Texas may reflect the movement
of small parties of nomadic people northwestward
towards the unique resources of the Yellowstone
region. Further examination of northwestern Plains
lithic assemblages for Edwards Plateau or Alibates
chert debris, or studies of Central Texas lithic assemblages for Harteville Uplift, Spanish Diggings,
or Flat-Top cherts documentation may help resolve

the movements of northwestern Plains obsidian to
the Texas region.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This article documents the presence of a
steatite bowl fragment from a Central Texas site
that is attributed to sources from the northwestern
Plains based on the absence of a local steatite bowl
industry, and similarities in vessel age and form between the Texas specimen and steatite vessels made
elsewhere in the coterminous North America. The
current inability to geochemically source steatite
using REE or metals renders as tentative positive
source identification of the steatite. However, the
suggestion of a northwestern Plains connection
with Texas based on the San Saba steatite bowl
sherd is strengthened by examining the occurrence of northwestern Plains obsidian across the
southern Plains. The most intense period of obsidian movement into Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas
occurred during the Late Prehistoric Period I/II
(ca. 500-1500 years B.P.) when an estimated 59.1
percent of northwestern Plains obsidians attributed
to a period are recovered. The Late Prehistoric
context of the San Saba steatite vessel fragment
is also supported by the presence of eight artifacts
of Malad, Idaho, obsidian recovered from the Fall
Creek site (41SS1) located less than 100 river km
(ca 40 straight-line km) from 41SS178 and within
the same county (Hester et al. 1986; Hester 1991).
Our contention is that the projected diameter
of the San Saba bowl makes this artifact substantially larger than other steatite objects from Texas,
and similarities in vessel rim form and Late Prehistoric temporal context all point to a northwestern Plains source of manufacture for the vessel.
The northwestern-southern Plains connection is
strengthened by the occurrence of obsidian from
the same region as the steatite bowl quarries in the
northwestern Plains. Unworked nodules and small
artifacts of steatite have been rarely reported from
sites in Texas and adjacent areas of the southern
Plains (cf. Pillaert 1963). But most, if not all, may
be from steatite sources other than from the northwestern Plains.
The distribution of northwestern Plains obsidian across Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas supports
the absence of neighbor-to-neighbor or downthe-line exchange from the northwestern Plains
sources. Instead, the distribution suggests obsidian

movements along two routes. One involves the
connections of obsidian between the northwestern
Plains and the upper Missouri River valley with a
secondary spread along the Hopewellian and later
Oneota interaction spheres toward the southwest
into northeastern Kansas and Oklahoma. The
second route involves the possible movement of
obsidian south along the eastern side of the Rocky
Mountains front range along the Taos/Trapper’s/
Cherokee trail and then eastward across the Oklahoma panhandle towards the Great Salt Plains
resources, and perhaps spreading southeastward
across Texas. This latter route passes close to the
Teton, Gros Ventre, and Wind River, Wyoming,
mountain ranges containing steatite outcrop quarries used by Late Prehistoric and Historic period
people for making stone vessels. Although the
mechanism of steatite and obsidian movements
has yet to be discerned, further efforts to identify
minor “unknown chert” debris in Late Prehistoric
assemblages may provide the insights needed to
refine the connections between these two areas.
