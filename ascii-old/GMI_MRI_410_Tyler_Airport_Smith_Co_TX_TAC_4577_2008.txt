ABSTRACT

Under contract with Coffman Associates and the City of Tyler, Texas, Geo-Marine, Inc.,
conducted an intensive archeological survey for improvements to the Tyler Pounds Regional
Airport in Tyler, Smith County, Texas (GMI project # 30585.00.01.01). Approximately 103.24
acres were examined by reconnaissance and intensive pedestrian survey. Two historic sites
(41SM386 and 41SM387), and four nonsite localities were identified as the result of field efforts.
None of these meet the criteria for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for
listing as a State Archeological Landmark. No further work is recommended. All records and
collected materials will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

The city of Tyler is planning improvements to Tyler Pounds Regional Airport, which is owned by
the city. Proposed development includes extension of an existing runway, relocation of runway
lights, and construction of an air traffic control tower. To accommodate the planned
improvements, small segments of Pleasant Retreat Road and Dixie Road will be realigned. In
compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, National Historic Preservation Act, and
the Antiquities Code of Texas, the airport, through Coffman Associates, contracted with GeoMarine, Inc. (GMI, project number 30585.00.01.01), to conduct a cultural resources survey of the
areas to be affected.
The project area consists of property within and south of the existing Tyler Pounds Regional
Airport. The airport is located on the south side of SH 64, approximately 2.5 miles west of the
Tyler city limits in Smith County, Texas (Figure 1). The remainder of the airport facility is
roughly circumscribed by CR 1184 to the west, Pleasant Retreat Road to the south, and Dixie
Road to the east (Figure 2). Part of the planned development of the airport includes extending a
northeast-to-southwest–trending runway 1,425 feet (ft) to the southwest. Runway lights will be
spaced along an additional 1,000 ft to the southwest. Approximately 4,925 ft of Pleasant Retreat
Road and 1,250 ft of Dixie Road will be realigned to accommodate proposed expansions to the
airport. A forested area encompassing roughly 67.14 acres (ac) along the southern border of the
airport will also be affected by construction of an air traffic control tower. Assuming a 100-ftwide right-of-way for the linear segments, total project area is estimated to be 103.24 ac.
The project area occurs on a series of level to gently rolling uplands and is dissected by several
channels of Indian Creek that vary in size from shallow ditches to wide chasms. Land use of the
project area consists of a combination of developed airport property, residential property, open
pasture, and young forest. The wooded areas typically consist of deciduous forest of oak, sweet
gum, and elm interspersed with pines and junipers and a dense understory of greenbrier, other
vines, scrub brush, Spanish dagger, and occasional prickly pear. Portions of pine forest are also
common in the northcentral portion of the wooded area.
On November 7–9, 12–16, and 27–29, 2007, GMI archeologists conducted an intensive
pedestrian archeological survey of the areas of proposed improvement. Melissa Green served as
the project’s Principal Investigator, while Angela Tiné, the Project Archeologist, planned and
1

directed the field efforts. Steven Hunt, Bethany Oliver, and Ryan Bennett participated in the field
activities. Mr. Hunt and Ms. Oliver also assisted in the laboratory. The following report details
the methods and results of the archeological survey.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project area lies within the Interior Coastal Plains of the Gulf Coastal Plains physiographic
province. The province is part of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic coastal geosyncline (Murray 1960).
This geosyncline consists of a gradually sloping basin that dips toward the Gulf of Mexico and
contains formations of limestone and sandstone deposited along the margins of an ancient
receding coastline. As the Gulf of Mexico formed during the late Cretaceous, clastic sediments
and carbonates were deposited over the worn-down Ouachita Mountains to the northwest, and
along the broad marginal shelf of the gulf basin. The Lower Cretaceous sandstones, mudstones,
limestones, and marls found throughout northeast Texas represent cycles of marine transgression
and regression throughout the period. By Upper Cretaceous times, infilling of the gulf basin and
shoreline progradation predominated as evidenced by Upper Cretaceous sandstones and
mudstones throughout much of the region (Bureau of Economic Geology 1992). As part of the
South Central Plains Ecoregion, the project area occurs along tertiary uplands that slope gently to
moderately and consist primarily of Eocene sediments (Griffith et al. 2004). The Neches River is
the nearest major drainage to the project area. The river runs for 416 miles and drains over
10,000 square miles of eastern Texas (Bureau of Economic Geology 1996). Several channels of
Indian Creek, a tributary of the Neches River, meander through the project area.
The underlying geology for the project area consists of the Sparta Sand Formation, and surface
soils are mapped as Pickton loamy fine sand, 1 to 6 percent slopes, Tonkawa fine sand, 1 to 6
percent slopes, Wolfpen loamy fine sand, 1 to 6 percent slopes, and Wolfpen loamy fine sand, 8
to 15 percent slopes (Hatherly 1993). Pickton soils are common in the northern wooded area
examined and occur along the northwest segment of the proposed realignment of Pleasant Retreat
Road. Pickton series soils are very deep, well-drained, sandy upland soils formed in
unconsolidated sandy and loamy sediments (Hatherly 1993:90). A small portion of the northern
wooded area is mapped as Tonkawa fine sand. The Tonkawa series consists of very deep,
excessively drained, sandy upland soils formed in thick sandy deposits (Hatherly 1993:93).
Wolfpen soils are the most common soil series within the project area. They occur in the
investigated western wooded area, in a small portion of the north wooded area, along the
proposed runway extension outside the present airport boundary, along the southeast segment of
the Pleasant Retreat Road realignment, and along the entire proposed Dixie Road realignment.
The Wolfpen series is made up of very deep, well-drained, sandy upland soils formed in sandy
and loamy sediments, particularly under hardwood and pine forest (Hatherly 1993:94). Areas
7

within the present airport facility closest to the runways are mapped as Urban Land, where
development has disturbed the natural soils to the extent that they cannot be classified (Hatherly
1993:45), and pits. The latter probably consists of areas used for borrow to level the airfield.
Climatically, the project area is characterized by long hot summers and short cool winters. Cold
waves in the winter are rare and not severe, usually lasting only one or two days. Winter
temperatures average 46 degrees Fahrenheit with an average daily low of 34 degrees. In the
summer, temperatures average 80 degrees with an average daily high of 92 degrees. The number
of days in the growing season with temperatures above freezing typically ranges between 200 and
220 (Hatherly 1993).
Precipitation is fairly heavy throughout the year. Prolonged droughts are rare, and the frequent
afternoon thunderstorms in summer are adequate to maintain crops. Severe storms, including
tornadoes, strike the area occasionally and the damage is varied and spotty. Every few years in
the summer or fall, a tropical depression moves inland, causing extremely heavy rains for one to
three days. Average annual precipitation is 118.8 centimeters [cm; 44 inches (in)], 52 percent of
which falls between April and September. Snowfall averages about 5.1 cm (2 in) a year, with an
average of one day with at least 2.5 cm (1 in). However, the annual number of such days varies
considerably (Hatherly 1993).
The Shortleaf Pine-Post Oak-Southern Red Oak forest covers a large portion of Northeast Texas,
including the project area. Trees commonly present within this vegetation zone iclude red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Q. stellata), hickory (Carya spp.), shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata).
loblolly pine (P. taeda), black hickory (C. texana), bluejack oak (Q. incana; also known as
sandjack oak), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana),
sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), sassafras (Sassafras albidum), and winged elm (Ulmus
alata). Understory vegetation consists of greenbrier (Smilax spp.), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), wax
myrtle (Myrica cerifera), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), hawthorn (Crataegus
spp.), and sumac (Rhus spp.). Grasses and ground cover include supplejack (Flagellaria indica),
beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), spranglegrass (Diplachne spp.), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum
spp.), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), pinehill bluestem (Schizacyrhium scoparium var.
divergens), narrowleaf woodoats (Chasmathium sessiliflorum), three-awn (Aristida spp.),
bushclover (Lespedeza capitata), and tickclover (Desmodium illinoense) (Griffith et al. 2004;
McMahan et al. 1984).
In the past, in addition to the timber and wood resources of the area, acorns, nuts, berries, and
grasses were available to both prehistoric and historic-era groups. Trees bearing edible nuts
identified as being present in Northeast Texas include eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra), pecan
(C. illinoinensis), shellbark hickory (C. laciniosa), shagbark hickory (C. ovata), mockernut
hickory (C. alba), black hickory (C. texana), nutmeg hickory (C. myristiciformis), swamp hickory
(C. cordiformus), pignut hickory (C. glabra), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), Allegheny
chinquapin (Castanea pumila), Ashe chinquapin (Castanea pumila ozarkensis), white oak (Q.
alba), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), and live oak (Q. virginiana) (Heartfield and Dieste 1984a,
1984b; Vines 1977).
Faunal resources available to prehistoric and historic-era populations in Northeast Texas include
numerous types of invertebrates along the major streams, as well as various species of mollusks,
including both bivalves and gastropods, and crustaceans (Swanton 1946). In prehistoric and early
historic times, fish resources would have included gar (Lepisosteus spp.), crappie (Poxomis spp.),
8

white bass (Morone spp.), black bass (Micropterus spp.), buffalo (Ictiomus spp.), shad
(Dorosoma spp.), bowfin (Amia calva), various shiners (Notropis, Cyprinella, and Notemigonus
spp.), chain pickerel (Esox niger), catfish (Ictalurus and Pylodictus spp.), sunfish (Lepomis spp.),
and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) (Blair 1950; Heartfield and Dieste 1984a, 1984b:2–
6). Frogs, turtles, salamanders, and alligators (Alligator sinensis) would have been present, as
well as a wide variety of migratory birds such as ducks, geese, and cranes (families Anadidae and
Gruidae). These would have been most numerous in the late fall and early winter, and other
resident birds, such as turkeys (Meleagris gallapavo) and mourning doves (Zenaida macroura),
would have been available year-round. Species of mammals included whitetail deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), bear (Ursus americanus), squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), opossum
(Didelphis marsupialis), and raccoon (Procyon lotor) (Swanton 1946). Valuable fur-bearing
animals would have included rabbit, beaver (Castor canadensis), raccoon, weasel and mink
(Mustela spp.), ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), opossum, red fox (Vulpes vulpes), gray fox
(Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Felis rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), badger (Taxidea taxus),
spotted skunk (Spilogale spp.), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus),
and river otter (Lutra canadensis) (Blair 1950). Several economically important species that may
have once inhabited the area, such as pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) and bison
(Bison bison), are now locally extinct (Blair 1950:100–102).

CULTURAL SETTING

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Early archeological research in Northeast Texas was intermittent and of limited scope. The
earliest known investigations occurred in 1879–1880 in Northeast Texas and were conducted by
Edward Palmer of the Peabody Museum. Although his primary occupation was the collection of
plants, he also collected artifacts for the museum and wished to ascertain whether the “Mound
Builders” were to be found in East Texas. His investigation was apparently cursory, as Palmer
concluded that mound sites were not to be found in Texas (McVaugh 1956; Putnam 1880). After
this, no archeology is known to have been undertaken in the northeastern portion of Texas until
early in the twentieth century, when Clarence B. Moore of the Philadelphia Academy of Science
ascended the Red River to investigate the archeology of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas,
publishing his findings in 1912. No excavations were undertaken in Texas, but the Cabe Mounds
site (41BW14), the E. H. Moores site (41BW2), and the A. J. Hatchel site (41BW3) were
examined (Moore 1912).
Beginning in the 1920s, more intensive and regionally based archeological investigations were
begun by J. E. Pearce, the founder of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Texas.
Early research was concentrated in Northeast Texas due to the large number of mound and burial
sites reported for this region. In 1919, Pearce was able to get funding from the Bureau of
American Ethnology (BAE) that allowed a reconnaissance into Northeast Texas. Based on the
examination of numerous collections, visits to sites in 14 counties, and limited test excavations,
Pearce concluded that Northeast Texas had tremendous research potential (Barnard 1939; Pearce
1924, 1931, 1932a). Funding proved to be the major constraint on Pearce’s research, as he did
not receive another major grant until 1927, when he was awarded monies from the Laura
Spelman Rockefeller Foundation of New York City (Barnard 1939). From 1920 until 1935,
Pearce and his crews conducted excavations at approximately 123 sites in Northeast Texas.
Gardner (1931), Goldschmidt (1935a, 1935b), Jackson (1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938), and
Pearce (1931, 1932a, 1932b) reported on some of those investigations.
Truly intensive archeological research had to wait until the Depression, when archeological
projects became one component of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal jobs
program. Funding under the WPA greatly exceeded anything previously seen in Texas, allowing
extensive site investigations and the accumulation of a huge regional database. Among the sites
11

investigated by the WPA in Northeast Texas were the Hatchel-Mitchell site complex (41BW3
and 41BW4, respectively) along the Red River (Davis 1970; Doran 1975; Dow 1987; Duffen et
al. 1940; Gilmore and McCormick 1980; Krieger 1946; Maples 1962; Suhm et al. 1954); the
George C. Davis site (41CE19) along the Neches River (Duffen et al. 1940; Ekland-Olson 1981;
Fritz 1975; Keller 1974; Newell and Krieger 1949; Shafer 1973; Spock 1977); and the Yarbrough
(41VN6) and Joslin (41VN3) sites in the Sabine River basin (Johnson 1962). Only interim
reports were published for much of that work; however, the database thus derived has provided
fertile ground for later students.
Avocational archeologists also began to work intensively in the region during the 1930s (e.g.,
Miroir n.d.). The most prominent was Dr. Clarence H. Webb, a pediatrician from Shreveport,
Louisiana. Webb’s work in northern Louisiana and East Texas was influential in the
development of the regional culture history, especially for the Caddoan tradition (e.g., Ford and
Webb 1956; Fulton and Webb 1953; Webb 1941, 1945, 1946, 1948a, 1948b, 1956, 1959, 1960,
1961, 1963, 1968; Webb and Dodd 1939, 1941; Webb and McKinney 1975; Webb et al. 1969,
1971). Some of the sites excavated by Webb and his associates include the Smithport Landing
site (16DS4), the Belcher Mound site (16CD13), the Gahagan Mound site (16RR1), the Mounds
Plantation (16CD12), and the Resch site (41HS16). At the same time, nonprofessionals and
collectors from Dallas and Texarkana also began to excavate into Caddoan mound and cemetery
sites in extreme Northeast Texas (see, for example, Harris 1953 and Miroir n.d.).
After World War II, there was no need for the WPA, and large-scale investigations were no
longer funded by the federal government. However, since the government was proposing the
construction of a series of reservoirs across the country, it was determined that archeological
investigations would be funded in order to salvage some of the data that would otherwise be
destroyed. The National Park Service served as the lead agency for this work, but the actual
fieldwork was undertaken by the River Basin Survey (RBS), which was formed as a part of the
BAE. Investigations undertaken at relevant lakes in North Texas by the RBS and successor
organizations included Lake O’ the Pines (Davis 1958, 1970; Davis 1961; Davis and Gipson
1960; Davis and Golden 1960; Jelks and Tunnell 1959; Lisk 1984; Miller et al. 1951; Thurmond
1981, 1990; Tunnell 1959; Turner 1978); Wright Patman Lake (Briggs and Malone 1970; Jelks
1961; Stephenson 1950); Lake Tawakoni (Duffield 1961; Duffield and Jelks 1961; Johnson
1957); and Cooper Lake (Duffield 1959; Gilmore and Hoffrichter 1964; Harris 1955;
Hatzenbuehler 1953; Johnson 1962; Moorman and Jelks 1952).
Beginning in the late 1960s, the federal and state governments began to require consideration of
the potential environmental impacts of government-funded projects. These regulations included
assessing the impacts to archeological resources. During the last several decades, the gradual
growth of the cultural resources management (CRM) industry, composed of government
agencies, universities, and private companies, has taken place. Survey and testing were
undertaken at a number of Northcentral and Northeast Texas reservoirs during this period,
including Lake Bob Sandlin (Driggers 1985; Flaigg 1982; Herrington 1979; Hsu 1969; Sullivan
1975; Thurmond 1981, 1990); Lake Fork Reservoir (Bruseth 1975; Bruseth and Perttula 1981;
Bruseth et al. 1977; Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Skiles et al. 1980; Skinner 1975;
Thurmond 1985); Black Cypress Reservoir (Northern and Skiles 1981); and Big Sandy Reservoir
(Gibson 1982; Perttula et al. 1986); and Lake Gilmer (Horizon Environmental Services, Inc.,
1992; Nichols et al. 1997). In addition, further investigations were undertaken at previously
inundated lakes such as Lake O’ the Pines (Gulf South Research Institute 1974; Thurmond 1981,
1990), Wright Patman Lake (Shiner 1982), and Caddo Lake (Campbell et al. 1983; Gibson 1969;
Gulf South Research Institute 1974; Thurmond 1981, 1990).
12

Intensive CRM studies have been undertaken at the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in eastern
Harrison County, near Karnack (Cliff et al. 1995; Cliff and Peter 1994a; Cliff, Peter, Largent, and
Waite 1996; Dieste et al. 1985; Peter and Stiles-Hanson 1989). Several lignite mines have also
been examined in the area, including Karnack (Heartfield, Price, and Green, Inc., 1986), Darco
(Carlson 1985; Corbin et al. 1976; Perttula and Skiles 1987; Studer 1980, 1982), and South
Hallsville (Dibble 1977; Espey Huston & Associates, Inc., 1979, 1984; Freeman 1978; Keller
1990a, 1990b, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996a, 1996b, 1998, 1999, 2000a, 2000b; LaVardera 1983a,
1983b, 1984a, 1984b, 1985; North American Consultants, Inc., 1984, 1985). More recent work in
the Caddo Lake area has focused on surveys of Harrison Bayou (Perttula and Nelson 1999), test
excavations at the Timber Hill site, a historic-age Caddo village on James Bayou (McCrocklin
1998; Parsons 1999), and intensive survey and some test excavations at Lake Bob Sandlin Park in
the Big Cypress Creek drainage (Perttula and Nelson 2002).
Two large, recent projects near Wright Patman Lake (formerly Lake Texarkana) have been
undertaken at the White Oak Creek Wildlife Management Area (WOCWMA) in Cass, Bowie,
Morris, and Titus counties, and at the Red River Army Depot and Lone Star Army Ammunition
Plant (RRAD/LSAAP) in Bowie County. The former was developed by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to mitigate the loss of wildlife habitat due to inundation of Cooper Lake farther
upstream along the Sulphur River. It consists of approximately 25,000 ac of bottomlands and the
adjacent upland margins along White Oak Creek and the Sulphur River. These investigations
began with the preparation of a research design to guide the work (Peter, Cliff, and Abbott 1990)
and have included surveys (Cliff 1994; Cliff and Peter 1992; Cliff, White, Hunt, Pleasant, and
Shaw 1996), site testing (Cliff and Hunt 1995; Largent et al. 1997), and data recovery (Cliff,
Green, Hunt, Shanabrook, and Peter 1996). The other project consisted of a series of studies
designed to inventory and evaluate the cultural resources present in the RRAD/LSAAP in central
Bowie County. These investigations have included surveys (Cliff and Peter 1994b; Cliff, Hunt,
Green, Peter, and Kent 1996; Gadus and Freeman 1998; Newman 1988; Peter and Cliff 1990a,
1990b), limited testing (Cliff and Peter 1988), and the preparation of a cultural resources
management plan, including an overview of Bowie County and the Great Bend in general (Peter
et al. 1991:Appendix I).
To the west of Wright Patman Lake, in Titus and Franklin counties, extensive cultural resources
investigations have been undertaken by Espey Huston & Associates, Inc., in association with
surface coal mining projects. At the Monticello B-2 Mine, north of Mount Pleasant, 237
prehistoric and historic-age archeological sites were recorded within approximately 20,000 ac
(Jones et al. 1993). Subsequently, testing was conducted at six prehistoric sites in 1991 (Kotter et
al. 1993) and an additional 10 sites in 1993 (Nash et al. 1995). On the basis of this work, data
recovery was conducted at two sites in 1993 and 1994 (Dixon et al. 1995, 1998; Perttula 1998a;
Perttula and Nelson 1995; Perttula, Neff, Glascock, Mulholland, Nelson, Tate, Cogswell, Skokan,
and Rogers 1998). Additional site testing in 1996 resulted in data recovery at the Ear Spool site
(41TT653), a Late Caddo Titus phase farmstead (Galan 1998). Elsewhere in Titus County, a
survey of 2,716 ac at the Monticello I Area, southwest of Mount Pleasant, recorded another 22
prehistoric and historic-age sites (Hoyt et al. 1994). Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) projects in Titus County include data recovery at site 41TT13 (Rogers et al. 2003) as
well as survey and ongoing testing along the proposed relief route for U.S. 271 around Mount
Pleasant.
Other recent archeological activities of importance in Northeast Texas include the 1987
excavation by the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation of a small Caddoan
hamlet and cemetery at the Murphy Branch site (41MX5) north of White Oak Creek (Brewington
13

and Dockall 1991; Brewington et al. 1995; Wormser 1988); data recovery at site 41BW422 along
Barkman Creek north of Hooks in Bowie County (Tucker 1994); excavations at the Oak Hill
Village site (41RK214), a large Caddo village in Rusk County (Cruse 1995; Rogers and Perttula
2004); excavations at the Rookery Ridge site (41UR133), a Late Caddo hamlet at Lake Gilmer in
Upshur County (Parsons 1998); and data recovery at the Pilgrim’s Pride site (41CP304), an
Archaic and Late Caddo Titus phase site in Camp County (Perttula 1999). Recent projects in the
immediate vicinity of Wright Patman Lake include a survey of the Beltex Lateral Pipeline in Cass
County south of the lake (Skinner 1992); small surveys conducted at Atlanta State Park for the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (Perttula 1998b; Perttula, Prikryl, and Nelson 1997; Turpin
1994a, 1994b); a number of surveys of timber-cutting areas surrounding the lake (Burson and
Cliff 2000; Cliff and Hunt 1998; Cliff, Hunt, Pleasant, Procter, and Ensor 1996; Hunt and
Borrego 2002; Hunt and Cliff 1998a, 1998b; Linder-Linsley and Lindsay 1997, 1998; Moore et
al. 1998; White et al. 1995); and testing of five prehistoric sites at the proposed Malden Lake
Park expansion (Owens and Hunt 1999). Recent investigations at Lake O’ the Pines include
several timber-cutting-area surveys (Burson and Cliff 2000; Cliff and Hunt 1998; Hunt and
Borrego 2002; Hunt and Cliff 1998a, 1998b; Hunt et al. 1995; Linder-Linsley and Lindsay 1997,
1998; Moore et al. 1998), a survey of two proposed pump stations (Brazos Valley Research
Associates 1997), a city of Longview water pipeline (Perttula, Turner, and Nelson 1998), and
investigations by the Friends of Northeast Texas Archaeology archeologists (Perttula and Nelson
1997, 2001; Perttula et al. 1996). More recently, Geo-Marine completed an intensive pedestrian
survey of the new 51-kilometer (km; 32 mi) Lake O’ the Pines South Side Regional Water Supply
System that traverses parts of Gregg, Harrison, Marion, and Upshur counties (Largent et al.
2004), identifying nine new archeological sites and revisiting two previously known sites.
The delay of the construction of Cooper Lake until the 1980s contributed to a more intensive
investigation of Cooper Lake than of other reservoirs. This work was conducted in three phases:
(1) the early investigations mentioned above, (2) a return to Cooper Lake in the 1970s (Doehner
and Larson 1978; Doehner et al. 1978; Hyatt and Doehner 1975; Hyatt and Skinner 1971; Hyatt
et al. 1974), and (3) mitigation efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s (Bailey et al. 1991; Bousman
et al. 1988; Cliff 1994; Fields and Gardner 1991; Fields et al. 1991; Fields et al. 1993; Gadus et
al. 1991; Gadus, Fields, and Bousman 1992; Gadus, Fields, Bousman, and Howard 1992; Jurney
and Bohlin 1993; Jurney et al. 1993; Lebo 1988; McGregor and Roemer 1989; Moir and Jurney
1988; Moir et al. 1989; Perttula 1988a, 1988b, 1989a, 1989b; Shepard et al. 1994; Winchell et al.
1992).
Between 2000 and 2007, GMI completed 126 work authorizations for archeological surveys and
impact evaluations for TxDOT for up to five districts in northeast Texas encompassing 42
counties (Largent et al. 2005; Peukert et al. 2003; Phillips et al. 2007). During this time, five
impact evaluations and five surveys were conducted in Smith County, resulting the identification
of one new archeological site.
More specific to the present project area, the airport manager, Davis Dickson (personal
communication, 2007), mentioned that an archeological survey had been conducted at the airport
in 1998 prior to construction of a new terminal building. Presumably, this was a reconnaissance
survey of 200 ac of airport property conducted by AR Consultants around the same time (Skinner
1998). Although no prehistoric sites were identified, a rock-lined well or cistern and remnants of
a World War II Army barracks (41SM242) were recorded.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The following brief discussion of the prehistoric archeological record of Northeast Texas draws
from previous summaries by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), Perttula (1988a), Story (1981, 1985,
1990), and Thurmond (1985, 1988, 1990). Although the cultural sequences are similar, they are
by no means identical. Indeed, due to what appears to be increasing regional differentiation
through time, the cultural sequences for the Great Bend Region (including Wright Patman Lake)
and the western Cypress Creek basin (including Lake O’ the Pines) diverge in the Caddoan
period. The generalized cultural sequences for each area are presented in Table 1 and presented
separately in the subsequent discussions.

Paleo-Indian Period
Although a pre-Clovis occupation of the New World had long been suggested (Adovasio et al.
1990; Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990; McGahey n.d.;
Meltzer 1989), it was not until excavations at the Monte Verde site in Chile that the evidence for
15

a pre-12,000 years before present (B.P.) occupation has been widely accepted. Within the
southeastern United States, however, the evidence for a pre-Clovis occupation remains disputed,
and thus the Paleo-Indian period remains the earliest recognized human occupation in Texas.
The Paleo-Indian period across the entire North Texas region (ca. 9500–7000 B.C.) generally
includes those remains of human presence that can be dated to the very late Pleistocene and the
immediate post-Pleistocene periods (for recent reviews of this period in North Texas, see Johnson
1989; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). As a matter of convenience, the period can
be subdivided into an early Paleo-Indian period (ca. 9500–8500 B.C.) and a late Paleo-Indian
period (8500–7000 B.C.).
In Northeast Texas, numerous diagnostic projectile points, such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Scottsbluff, and San Patrice, have been recovered as isolated surface finds or excavated in later
contexts (Carley n.d.; Perttula 1988a:17), but unfortunately, few Paleo-Indian sites in good
stratigraphic context have been found (Perttula 1988a:17; Preston 1972, 1974), and fewer have
received any sort of systematic excavation. Both Perttula and Story note the possible presence of
horizontally stratified early Paleo-Indian deposits at the Forrest Murphey site (41MR62) at Lake
O’ the Pines, but the site was reportedly destroyed by dam construction before being excavated
(Perttula 1988a:17; Perttula et al. 1986:47; Story 1990:184–185). The situation of the Murphey
site and the discovery of the deeply buried Clovis-aged Aubrey site (41DN479) along the Elm
Fork of the Trinity River in Northcentral Texas (Ferring 1989, 1990, 2001) suggest that wellpreserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northeast Texas will only be found by examining deeply stratified
Pleistocene terraces or by penetrating more recent Holocene alluvium in modern flood plains.
Despite the lack of good data relating to the early Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas, some
attempts have been made to generalize regarding settlement mobility and intensity of site
occupation, drawing on the limited data that is known and on assumptions based on comparisons
with other areas. For instance, a number of researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of
group mobility in the broad distribution of Paleo-Indian artifacts over the landscape and in the
variety of presumably nonlocal lithic raw materials from which they were made (Meltzer and
Smith 1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1990:177). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of large
megafauna by Paleo-Indians in the western United States, coupled with the known presence of
similar species in Northeast Texas between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see Hemmings 1983;
Slaughter and Hoover 1963), has resulted in the popular conclusion that “big game hunting” was
part of the Paleo-Indian subsistence strategy in Northeast Texas. Although a possible association
between a Clovis point and mastodon remains at the Murphey site (Story 1990:185) does support
this likelihood, increasing evidence from sites to the west (such as the Aubrey site) suggests that
Paleo-Indian groups were less dependent upon “big game hunting” than has been assumed in the
past.
The late Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas appears to be distinguished by the divergence of
the earlier, widespread fluted point tradition into several distinct subtraditions. The first of these
includes Scottsbluff, Plainview, and similar lanceolate points that appear to be part of a more
western or “plains-derived” subtradition in terms of origin and style; the second includes Dalton
and Dalton-related projectile points that have a wide distribution throughout the wooded
southeastern and midwestern United States. Some researchers have suggested that this Dalton
horizon represents an adaptation to the changing environment at the end of the Pleistocene
(Goodyear 1982:389–391), a view that has found some support in the addition of the Dalton adze,
a presumed “heavy, woodworking tool,” to what otherwise is viewed as a Paleo-Indian tool kit
16

(Kelley et al. 1988:21). San Patrice, an important complex that may be related to Dalton, is found
in eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and southern Arkansas and is
characterized by San Patrice points, Keithville points, and Albany scrapers (Ensor 1987;
Schambach 1979; Webb et al. 1971).

Archaic Period
With the end of the Ice Age, the prehistoric residents of the region began to develop into localized
populations of efficient hunter-gatherers, exploiting localized resource bases. This period, and
the subsistence pattern that characterizes it, has become known as the Archaic. The Archaic
represents a long period of time that was characterized by only gradual and minor changes in
subsistence patterns, lithic technology, and projectile point styles. It was apparently a period of
strong cultural stability. Archaic populations are usually portrayed as generalized hunters and
gatherers with more limited geographic ranges than the preceding Paleo-Indian peoples. At the
present time, there is no evidence for the development of local cultigens during the Archaic
period in Texas, although this is not the case for the Ozark Highlands and other parts of the
eastern United States.
The Archaic period in Northeast Texas is tentatively dated between 7000 and 200 B.C. As is true
for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of early, middle, and late
subperiods, has been applied in Northeast Texas. Although reliable dating for the Archaic period
in this area of Texas is virtually nonexistent, these divisions have been given tentative dates on
the basis of better-dated sites in surrounding areas. Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from
7000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to 2000 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 2000
to 200 B.C. (overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas include Fields and Tomka
1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1985, 1990). Archaic remains are usually found in
upland settings and are frequently mixed with later material (Campbell et al. 1983; Story 1981).
General trends that have been proposed as characterizing the Archaic period in Northeast Texas
include an increasingly complex settlement system, increasing population size and density,
increasing sedentism, and the development of distinct group territories (Perttula 1988a:17; Story
1985:52). Despite these changes, however, no evidence of any level of food production (even
incipient production) has been reported from any Northeast Texas Archaic site (Perttula
1988a:17; Story 1990:Table 56), in spite of the fact that definite steps toward food production
were being taken elsewhere in the eastern United States (Ford 1985:347–349; Watson 1988).
During the Early Archaic (ca. 7000–4000 B.C.), the occurrence of small and widely distributed
sites has been suggested to reflect high group mobility within large and poorly defined territories,
based on a generalized hunting and gathering economy (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Story 1985:35,
39). Projectile point forms that may be associated with the Early Archaic in Northeast Texas
include Kirk, Keithville, Palmer, Cossatot, Dawson, and Wells (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).
In comparison to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period (4000–2000 B.C.) appears to be
characterized by (1) an increased diversity of tool types; (2) greater interregional variability; (3)
the addition of ground, pecked, and polished stone tools; and (4) an increased use of plant foods,
as indicated by the addition of mortars, pestles, and milling stones (Neuman 1984:77, 79). The
dependence upon abundant forest resources (e.g., oak mast production, deer, and small mammals)
that are evenly distributed over most of the region probably resulted in evenly distributed
population densities and favored the development of exclusive or “fixed” territories (Plog and
17

Upham 1983:202; Story 1985:41). Although grinding stones apparently were introduced during
the Early Archaic period, it was not until the Middle Archaic that their use became widespread.
Grinding and polishing were used to produce grooved axes, atlatl weights, and ground stone
pendants during this period. Diagnostic dart points that may be associated with the Middle
Archaic include Big Sandy, Calf Creek, Johnson, Carrollton, Morrill, Evans, Lone Oak, Trinity,
and Wesley (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).
Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period in Northeast Texas
(ca. 2000–200 B.C.) as evidenced by an apparent increase in the number of sites, a greater
distribution of sites over the landscape, and evidence of increasing degrees of sedentism. At the
same time, group mobility may have become more limited and interregional contact may have
become much more common. If the greater spatial dispersal of sites is not a result of sampling
error due to unequal destruction or burial of earlier sites, it may reflect an economic system with
increasing reliance on all available floral and faunal resources, although the economic data to
support this view are generally absent. Throughout Northeast Texas, Late Archaic period sites
are relatively common in the uplands, and a number are known from the flood plain of the Red
River as well as Late Archaic components in sites to the south near Lake Sam Rayburn in the
Neches/Angelina river area (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), but no regional phases have yet been
identified (Schambach 1982a:3–6). Dart points that may be diagnostic of the Late Archaic
include Lange, Castroville, Ellis, Palmillas, Edgewood, Yarbrough, Ensor, and Kent (Story 1990;
Thurmond 1990).

Early Ceramic Period
The Early Ceramic period (200 B.C.–A.D. 800) in Northeast Texas is generally not well defined
and is largely identified by similarities in pottery and projectile points to sites of the Fourche
Maline tradition north of the Red River (recent overviews that provide good information for this
period include Perttula et al. 1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). Diagnostic
artifacts consist of coarse plainware ceramics, tempered with either clay/grog or bone, and Gary
projectile points. The ceramics generally are grouped together as Williams Plain; but given the
wide range of temporal and spatial variability present, they should probably be viewed as one or
more undefined varieties of that type. Discounting ceramic differences at the varietal level, the
remains of the Early Ceramic period in Northeast Texas seem to be most closely related to
Schambach’s (1982b:188, 1998) Fourche Maline tradition in Arkansas. Despite other similarities
to Fourche Maline, however, no Early Ceramic period burial mounds are known in the Texas
portion of the Great Bend. The few that are known in East Texas occur to the south in the Sabine
and Neches river basins around the Toledo Bend and Sam Rayburn reservoir areas (see Story
1990:Figure 41) at the Coral Snake (16SA48; on the eastern edge of Toledo Bend in Louisiana)
and Jonas Short (41SA101) mound sites (Jensen 1968; McClurkan et al. 1966, 1980). The lack of
such evidence in Northeast Texas leaves open the question of whether or not this area was
undergoing the same processes of cultural evolution presumably responsible for the development
of burial mound use elsewhere (see Perttula 1988a:18; Story 1990).
Perttula (1988a:18) has noted what appears to be a major presence of Early Ceramic period
occupation within the Sulphur River basin, although this may be more the result of intensity of
research or factors of site preservation rather than the actual presence of a large Early Ceramic
population. In regard to modeling settlement patterns during this period, Perttula (1988a:18)
suggests that “Early Ceramic or Fourche Maline settlements are . . . represented by villages and
18

hamlets in the flood plains or terraces of larger streams, and by smaller components in the
uplands.” Many of the sites on which Perttula bases this model, including Snipes at Wright
Patman Lake (Jelks 1961) and Tick, Thomas, Hurricane Hill, and Lawson at Cooper Lake
(Doehner and Larson 1978; Martin 1996a, 1996b; Perttula 1990), contain middens that are taken
as indicating a more sedentary settlement pattern than that of the preceding Archaic period. Two
apparent pits (Features 1 and 2) radiocarbon dated to the Early Ceramic period (1,460 ± 60 B.P.
and 2,090 ± 30 B.P., respectively) at 41HP137 at Cooper Lake yielded hickory nut, acorn, wild
tubers (possibly the prairie turnip, Pediomelum or Psoralea sp.), and what may be fragments of
cultivated squash or gourd (Fields et al. 1994:12; McGregor 1996:357).
Elsewhere in Northeast Texas, sandy paste ceramics (cf., Bear Creek Plain and Goose Creek
Plain) appear to be common on Early Ceramic period sites south of the Sabine River (Story
1981:146) along the upper reaches of the Angelina and Neches rivers, as well as farther south in
the Sam Rayburn and Toledo Bend reservoir areas. This pottery is technologically different from
the ceramics in the northern area of Northeast Texas. Many of the sites south of the Sabine (e.g.,
Deshazo [41NA27] and George C. Davis [41CE19], as well as Wolfshead [41SA117], Runnells 1
and 2 [41SA87 and SA86], and Dubose [41SA100] in the Sam Rayburn Reservoir area) exhibit
ceramics attributed to the Mossy Grove tradition (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:262, 233; Story
1990:277]). The indigenous Mossy Grove hunter-gatherer population was likely pushed
southward by Caddo groups at the end of the period (ca. A.D. 800/900) (Story 1990:256). Lithics
from these more southerly sites are predominantly the Kent and Gary dart point styles, along with
“rather nondescript bifaces . . . [that may represent] projectile point manufacture failures” and
some unifaces (Story 1990:256). Toward the middle–late Early Ceramic period (ca. A.D. 500–
600), the bow and arrow technology, along with the Friley arrow point, likely was introduced into
the southeastern Texas region (Story 1990:256).

Caddo Period

Caddo Period in the Great Bend-Neches/Angelina Regions
The Formative (A.D. 800–1000) and Early Caddo (A.D. 1000–1200) periods in the Great BendNeches/Angelina regions are not well defined. Ceramics for both of these periods include
Hickory Fine Engraved, Carmel Engraved, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, and Pennington
Punctated-Incised (Thurmond 1990:Table 8). Thurmond has further distinguished between
equivalents of these two periods on the basis of the presence of Davis Incised, Holly Fine
Engraved, Kiam Incised, Spiro Engraved, and Weches Fingernail Impressed in the earlier (along
with some late varieties of Coles Creek types), and of Canton Incised, Haley Engraved, Maxey
Noded Redware, Sanders Engraved, and Sanders Plain in the later, although some researchers are
more inclined to put the latter four types in the Middle Caddoan period.
The Formative and Early Caddoan periods are characterized by what may best be termed the Alto
complex or Alto sphere, a widespread manifestation related to the Alto phase, originally defined
at the George C. Davis site in Cherokee County, Texas, south of the Great Bend area (Newell and
Krieger 1949). The Alto complex shows strong influence from Coles Creek to the east and
appears to partially overlap it in time. It also, however, shows a number of new characteristics
(Neuman 1970), including new projectile point types (i.e., Hayes and Homan arrow points), new
ceramic vessel forms (i.e., the carinated bowl and the bottle), and a new mode of vessel
decoration (i.e., fine engraving with red pigment filler).
19

Perttula (1988a:18) has suggested that these and other cultural innovations, including the
introduction of the bow and arrow ca. A.D. 800 and increased food production based on maize, led
to increases in population and sociopolitical complexity during these periods. The settlement
system became increasingly complex, apparently involving sedentary villages and farmsteads,
special function sites (what Binford [1980] has called logistical camps), and mound centers that
were presumably ritual or ceremonial in function (see Perttula 1988a:18–19). A number of such
mound centers dating to the Formative and Early Caddo periods occur in Northeast Texas,
including the T. M. Coles or Mustang Creek Mound (Jackson 1931) on a tributary of the Sulphur
River to the west of Wright Patman Lake, and several mounds at the lake itself (Stephenson
1950). Many more mound sites occur along the Red River and its immediate tributaries to the
north (Banks 1983; Miller 1986; Taylor 1949). To the south, the Bivins-Flanagan mound (also
known as Hudnall-Pirtle (41RK4) on the middle Sabine River is a major multiple mound site with
six to eight mounds, a plaza, and a habitation area (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:129). The
George C. Davis site in Cherokee County on the Neches River may be the best representative of
the mound center-village site type, another characteristic of the Alto focus. The Early Caddoan
component of this site likely indicates an emigrant group from the middle Sabine River area
(possibly Bivins-Flanagan?) arriving prior to ca. 900 (Story 1990:325).
The Middle Caddo period (A.D. 1200–1400) in the Great Bend region includes what is known as
the Haley phase, the definition of which is based generally on mortuary data, largely from C. B.
Moore’s excavations at the Haley site (3MI1) in Arkansas (Moore 1912). The Haley phase
appears to represent a development out of the earlier Alto complex, and among the continuities
from the earlier period is the use of shaft grave burials for some members of the society, who
were accompanied into the afterlife by relatively rich grave offerings (Kelley et al. 1988:26).
This phase was centered in the Great Bend area in Arkansas, but northwestern Louisiana and
northeastern Texas also fall within its peripheral influence. A Haley phase component has been
recognized at the Hatchel site in Bowie County (Davis 1970:44), and other Haley components are
known in the area, including the Cabe Mounds site (Perttula et al. 1995) and the Mitchell site
(Cliff et al. 1997). Coker Mound (41CS1) also apparently has a Haley phase component, based
on radiocarbon dates and a reported Haley Engraved bottle in a mortuary feature (Perttula,
Turner, and Nelson 1997:17–20). Despite its presence in Texas, however, the Haley phase was
apparently most fully elaborated in the Arkansas portion of the Great Bend.
Most of the well-known Haley phase components, especially in Arkansas, relate to mound
centers, although it is unclear whether all of them were associated with villages (Wyckoff 1974).
One well-investigated nonmound habitation site is known from Arkansas, apparently a small
farmstead located on “a natural levee” or “high ground overlooking riverine bottom lands”
(Wyckoff 1974:106, 113). The site contained two circular house structures and a small trash
dump and has suggested to some that the Haley phase settlement pattern involved small,
dispersed farmsteads surrounding vacant ceremonial centers (Hoffman 1970). Wyckoff
(1974:107) also notes, however, the existence of mound centers with “potentially large villages,”
as well as nonmound cemeteries located close to mound centers. Finally, he states that:
[t]here is certainly an overall tendency for the Haley components, mound centers and non-mound
habitation areas alike, to associate with a riverine valley setting. Most of the mound centers did occur
in the valleys of major streams, but [some mound centers] were on the flood plains of streams tributary
to the major rivers [Wyckoff 1974:112].

20

In regard to sociopolitical organization within Haley phase society, the complexity of the
mortuary ceremonialism and apparent status ranking evident in the burials recovered from Haley
phase sites, as well as the presumed organizational control necessary to construct the mound
centers, strongly suggest that there was “a political and religious hierarchy that operated
throughout the Haley Focus [sic] society” (Wyckoff 1974:110).
In the Sabine River area, the Oak Hill Village site (41RK214) in Rusk County (Rogers and
Perttula 2004), Washington Square (41NA49) in Nacogdoches County, and Tyson (41SY92) in
the Attoyac River basin in Shelby County are among the major mound centers dating to the
Early-Middle Caddo period (Perttula 2000:24–25). Data from these sites suggest a horticultural
lifestyle based on maize and squash, supplemented by wild seeds, nuts, and tubers, along with
fishing and continued hunting of deer and other game. Mounds were used both as temple and
burial sites, and the larger centers were important civic-ceremonial areas. Many of the large
mound centers contained structures and plazas along with storage/granary structures and pits.
The distribution of the mound centers suggests an integrated society of rather complex sociopolitical extent. The Washington Square mound, securely dated to A.D. 1268 and 1302, was built
at the crossroads between aboriginal trails (later known as the east-west Caddo Trace and the
north-south Camino Real) and may have been primarily a ceremonial center since little indication
of permanent habitation has been documented. Radiocarbon dates also suggest the possibility
that Washington Square was the successor to the George C. Davis site, which was essentially
abandoned by the early fourteenth century (Perttula 2000:24–29).
Material culture reflects corner-notched and rectangular-stemmed arrow points, celts, Gahagan
bifaces, scrapers, and borer/perforators, as well as ceramic pipes, earspools, and figurines. The
decorated carinated, boat-shaped, cylindrical, and globular bowls and jars; bottles; plates and
platters; and ollas ceramics, however, are the most distinctive cultural items. These ceramics
were used for various food-related tasks—cooking, serving, storage—as well as for use as
personal items and ceremonial beakers in mortuary occasions (Perttula 2000:26–27).
The Late Caddo period (A.D. 1400–1680) includes the final part of the prehistoric period and the
initial years of European contact (for an overview of this period and the subsequent Historic
Caddo period, see Perttula 1992). The survivors of the de Soto entrada apparently entered
Northeast Texas about midway through the Late Caddo period, the latter part of which appears to
have overlapped with the initial movements of seventeenth-century European explorers and
traders into northeastern Texas.
In the lower Sulphur River basin, two archeological complexes have been defined for the Late
Caddo period, the Titus phase and the Texarkana phase (Schambach 1982a; Thurmond 1985).
The Titus phase appears to be centered between the Sabine and Sulphur rivers in the Northeast
Texas piney woods and post-oak savanna. The Texarkana phase is located in the upper portion of
the Great Bend of the Red River and extends southward to include a portion of the lower Sulphur
River drainage (Wyckoff 1974:Figure 4). The definition of the Texarkana phase is based largely
on WPA excavations conducted at the Hatchel mound and at the Mitchell and Moores cemeteries
situated on the Red River northwest of Texarkana (Davis 1970:50–51). Texarkana phase sites,
such as Sherwin on the lower Sulphur River, probably existed as satellites to these larger,
permanent settlements on the Red River (Perttula 1988a).

21

Both the Titus and Texarkana phases appear to be characterized by small hamlets or farmsteads
that were probably occupied by small family groups of shifting agriculturalists. These farmsteads
were apparently characterized by a limited number of structures and a small family cemetery (see
Brewington and Dockall 1991; Brewington et al. 1995; Jelks 1961; Perttula 1988a; and Wormser
1988). They presumably were associated with larger, more permanent suprahousehold sites,
including both mound centers and nonmound cemeteries, which served to integrate the scattered
households into a unified social group.
In the Neches/Angelina river basin, the Frankston (A.D. 1400–1650) and Angelina (post-A.D.
1450/1500) phases are dominant. In this area, there is a noticeable lack of Late Caddo large
mound burials after ca. A.D. 1400. Additionally, the lack of elaborate burials, especially as
indicated at the George C. Davis site, may indicate a decline in organizational hierarchy (Story
1990:340). The Frankston phase A. C. Saunders site (41AN19) near the Neches River in
Anderson County is the only known mound site. Frankston phase habitation sites consist
primarily of farmsteads, hamlets, and small villages (Perttula 2000:31) and many cluster along
the upper Neches River (Anderson 1972:163). Burials tend to be in small (possibly) family or
village cemeteries of less than 10 individuals, with many interments containing ceramic grave
goods. To the south near Sam Rayburn Reservoir, the Angelina focus sites yielded ceramic
elbow pipes, and brushed and punctuated ceramics. Perdiz arrow points, conch shell beads, bone
tools, and worked bone artifacts have been recovered from burials at the Walter Bell site
(41SB50) in Sabine County (Jelks 1965:56–60). In the Toledo Bend Reservoir area in Sabine and
Shelby counties, Late Caddo residential settlements exhibit extensive middens and small
cemeteries that were contemporaneous with Angelina phase sites to the west (Perttula 2000:32).

Caddo Period in the Big Cypress Creek Basin
The time span between the Archaic and the Caddo period (i.e., the Early Ceramic from ca. A.D.
200–800) in the Cypress Creek basin is poorly represented, but Caddo habitation of the period
subsequent to ca. A.D. 800 is well documented. The Caddo period in the Cypress Creek basin has
been subdivided into early, middle, and late subperiods: the Early Caddo from ca. A.D. 800 to
1300, the Middle Caddo from ca. A.D. 1300 to 1400, and the Late Caddo from A.D. 1400 to 1600
(see Thurmond 1990:39–40). Thurmond’s (1990) Early Caddo period includes components
related to the Alto and Sanders foci and is subdivided into two parts. Ceramic types characteristic
of Period 1 (A.D. 800–1100) include Holly Fine Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro
Engraved, Kiam Incised, Weches Fingernail Impressed, and Coles Creek Incised; Williams Plain
ceramics also are found. During Period 2 (A.D. 1100–1300), ceramic types shift to Sanders
Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Sanders Plain, and Canton Incised; Williams Plain makes up a
smaller part of the assemblage than previously. Arrow points for the Early Caddo period as a
whole include Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, and Scallorn (Thurmond 1990:226–227).
The Middle Caddo period in the western Cypress Creek basin is seen as being transitional from
the Early Caddo Period 2 to the Late Caddo Whelan phase. Thurmond identifies only 14 sites for
this period, all of which are found in the upper reaches of Big Cypress Creek. Ceramic types
identified for this period include Ripley Engraved, Avery Engraved, Canton Incised, Maydelle
Incised, Bullard Brushed, Pease Brushed-Incised, and La Rue Neck-Banded. Projectile point
types found during this period are Bonham, Catahoula, Alba, Perdiz, and Clifton (Thurmond
1990:227–228).

22

The eastern and western portions of the Cypress Creek basin show distinct differences in material
culture during the Late Caddo period, with a dividing line close to the western end of Caddo
Lake. In the eastern side of the basin, the Late Caddo period includes the Bossier and Belcher
phases, while in the western side of the basin are the Whelan (A.D. 1350–1430) and Titus (A.D.
1430–1680) phases. Thurmond (1990) labels the western group the Cypress cluster. He believes
this represents the formation of a distinct social group, equivalent to the Kadohadacho and
Hasinai confederacies known ethnographically (Thurmond 1985).
The Whelan phase is the earlier temporal phase identified for the Cypress cluster. Engraved
ceramics from Whelan phase sites consist primarily of Ripley Engraved, with smaller amounts of
Taylor Engraved and Wilder Engraved. Motifs observed on Ripley Engraved ceramics include
the scroll, scroll and circle, alternating nested triangle, horizontal diamond, and bisected diamond,
with the border elements usually being filled with curvilinear hatchures. Utility wares from this
period are significantly different from Early Caddo utility wares. Body sherds are about equally
divided between brushed and plain ceramics, and other treatments, such as incising, punctation,
fingernail-impressed, and red-filming, become minor parts of the assemblage. Brushed ceramics
are about equally divided between Bullard Brushed and Pease Brushed-Incised; plain-bodied
vessels are primarily classified as Maydelle Incised, and La Rue Neck-Banded pottery is
uncommon. Arrow points typical of this period are Perdiz and Scallorn (Thurmond 1990:228).
The succeeding Titus phase represents the final prehistoric occupation of the upper Cypress
Creek basin. The engraved ceramics are still dominated by Ripley Engraved, although Taylor
Engraved and Wilder Engraved are more common than in the Whelan phase, and two new types,
Bailey Engraved and Johns Engraved, appear. A new motif for Ripley Engraved, the pendant
triangle, appears to be limited to this phase. Border elements change from the curvilinear
hatchures of the Whelan phase to broad, deeply excised areas. Specialized ceramics, such as
Killough Pinched jars, zoomorphic effigy bowls, and noded rattle bowls, become more common
during the Titus phase. Utility wares also underwent significant change from the preceding
period. Brushed ceramics are reduced in frequency compared to the Whelan phase, and a new
decorative element, appliqué, is introduced. Pease Brushed-Incised virtually disappears from the
assemblage, while Maydelle Incised is found in slightly reduced frequencies as compared to the
Whelan phase, and La Rue Neck-Banded remains constant. Two new types, Harleton Appliqué
and a type similar to McKinney Plain, are introduced during this period. Extensive trade contacts
with the McCurtain phase to the north are indicated by the occurrence of Avery Engraved, Bowie
Engraved, Cass Appliqué, and Simms Engraved ceramics at Titus phase sites. Similar contacts
with the Belcher phase to the east appear to be limited to the adjacent sites of the Titus phase.
Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points continue into the Titus phase, and Bassett, Maud, Reed, and
Talco points are introduced (Thurmond 1990:228–229).
Thurmond (1990:229–233) has defined four regional subclusters within the Titus phase—Three
Basins, Tankersley Creek, Swauano Creek, and Big Cypress Creek. These subclusters are
hypothesized to represent discrete social groups. The Big Cypress Creek subcluster is
concentrated at Lake O’ the Pines, with two outliers found to the south along Little Cypress
Creek and the Sabine River. Engraved ceramics characteristic of this subcluster consist primarily
of Ripley Engraved and Taylor Engraved; Bailey Engraved, Johns Engraved, and Wilder
Engraved are relatively insignificant. Decorative motifs seen on Ripley Engraved ceramics are
mostly of the pendant triangle type, although the scroll, scroll and circle, and circle and
continuous scroll are not uncommon. Bullard Brushed and Karnack Brushed-Incised are the
dominant types of utilitarian ceramics, and Harleton Appliqué, Maydelle Incised, and the
23

McKinney Plain-like ceramics are less common than in the other subclusters. Belcher phase
trade vessels are also present, especially at the easternmost sites. The primary arrow point is the
Talco, although Maud and Bassett points are also present.
The Titus phase is somewhat imprecisely dated from ca. A.D. 1450 to perhaps as late as A.D. 1680
(Perttula 1992; Thurmond 1990). This evidence includes the reputed recovery by a private
collector of glass beads from a burial at the Tracey site (41CP71), which is a part of the Big
Cypress subcluster, and the discovery of the Wichita ceramic types Womack Engraved and
Womack Plain from the Culpepper (41HP1) and the W. A. Ford (41TT2) sites of the Three
Basins subcluster (Scurlock 1962; Thurmond 1990:233). Thurmond (1990:233) believes that,
considering the large number of Titus phase burials investigated over the years, the dearth of
historic-age material indicates a real decline in the Titus phase and an abandonment of the
western Cypress Creek basin prior to the beginning of the Historic period.
Thurmond’s (1990:233) reconstruction is that the people represented by the Cypress cluster were
reduced by disease in the Protohistoric period, with the result that, by the time the Spanish and
French became permanently established in the area, the upper Cypress Creek basin had been
abandoned. He identifies the Cypress cluster with the Lacane, a group visited by the de Soto
expedition in 1542. The Spanish exposed the Lacane to a variety of diseases to which they had
no resistance. Such diseases have been suggested to have had significant impacts upon other
groups in the Southeast (Dobyns 1983; Dye 1989; Murray 1989:49; Perttula 1993; Perttula et al.
1986:186–189; Smith 1989). Following this episode, the remnants of the Lacane left the area and
took refuge with the Hasinai and/or the Kadohadacho confederacies.

Historic Native American Period
The Historic Caddo period (A.D. 1680–1860) in Northeast Texas began with the founding of the
short-lived French colony on the Texas coast by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, and
ended with the expulsion of the Caddo from Texas in 1859. During the closing decades of the
seventeenth century, French explorers (including Sieur de Tonti, Bienville, and St. Denis)
traveled through the upper Red River valley and made contact with the Native Americans
residing in the area. The primary Native American groups inhabiting the Great BendNeches/Angelina river regions at that time consisted of Caddoan speakers, presumably
descendants of groups that had inhabited the area at least as far back as A.D. 800. These Caddoan
populations are divided very generally into the Kadohadacho in the Great Bend area north of the
Sulphur River, and the Hasinai in the Neches/Angelina river region south of the Sabine River.
The groups in the northern area comprised the Kadohadacho Confederacy (Swanton 1946:141).
The confederacy was originally composed of five groups—the Kadohadacho, the Petit Caddo, the
Upper Natchitoches, the Upper Nasoni, and the Nanatsoho. According to Williams (1974:286),
the Upper Yatasi and the Cahinnio joined the confederacy at a later time, possibly in the early
eighteenth century in the case of the Cahinnio and in the 1760s in the case of the Yatasi. The
confederacy apparently controlled the entire Texas portion of the Great Bend region. Don
Domingo Terán de los Rios, who in 1692 visited one of the Kadohadacho villages located just
above the Great Bend of the Red River near present-day Texarkana (Swanton 1946:57), noted
that their power extended as far south as Big Cypress Bayou (Hackney 1966:3). The origin of the
confederacy is unknown at present, but it may have arisen as a result of what was probably a
severe demographic impact resulting from the de Soto entrada (cf., Smith 1989).
24

The Kadohadacho were a relatively sedentary group and suffered no severe displacement until the
Apache, Osage, and Kichai intruded into their areas in the early nineteenth century. Moderate
amounts of data are available from early European and Euro-American visits to the area. Two
archeological phases, the Little River and Chakanina, appear to fall within this early Historic
period in the Great Bend region (Kelley et al. 1988:27). Although the Little River phase was
originally proposed as the archeological remains of the entire Kadohadacho Confederacy, the
phase has become linked with the Roseborough Lake–Hatchel/Mitchell/Moores site complex
(41BW2/3/4/5) associated with the Upper Nasoni in Bowie County and several other sites
(Schambach 1982a). Ceramics from the Roseborough Lake–Hatchell/Mitchell/Moores complex
consist of trailed, engraved, neck-banded, and plain types. Historic-age glass beads and metal
fragments have also been recovered from the complex (Story 1990:348). The Chakanina phase
has been defined mostly on the assemblage from the Cedar Grove site (3LA97) in Arkansas
(Schambach 1982a). Schambach believes this phase to represent the Kadohadacho proper and
excludes the closely associated Upper Nasoni, Upper Natchitoches, and the Nanatsoho groups.
Ceramics are decorated with engraving, incising, and appliqué. Much of the utility ware is shelltempered.
The introduction of European diseases severely reduced the Caddo groups even though
widespread contact was restricted until the 1700s. The loss of population likely resulted in
emigration from the Sulphur River area, possibly leaving only enclaves along major trails and
portages such as the Nasoni portage in Bowie County (Peter and Cliff 1990a:33). Between 1788
and 1790, the groups of the Kadohadacho Confederacy were forced south into Louisiana by the
severity of raids by the Osage (Smith 1995:82–83; Williams 1974:297). At that time, they settled
with the Petit Caddo, near Caddo Lake on Cypress Creek, about 35 miles west of the main branch
of the Red River (Smith 1995:83), where they were encountered by Freeman and Custis in 1806
(Flores 1984:16, fn 3). In the Caddo Treaty of 1835, the Kadohadacho sold their land in the
United States and agreed to leave the country within one year (Smith 1995:122; Williams
1974:309); but as late as 1840, one band remained in the Caddo Lake area, possibly in the same
village, which was along the Louisiana-Texas border (Smith 1995:143–146). In 1841, this band
joined the rest of the Kadohadacho in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) north of the Red
River (Smith 1995:146). The rest of the Caddo remained in Texas, but by 1855, they were
residing, along with other Native American groups, on a tract of land on the Brazos River in
Northcentral Texas. Subsequently, they were moved north to Indian Territory in 1859 (Swanton
1946:99).
After the abandonment of the Great Bend region by the Kadohadacho, groups of displaced Native
Americans from east of the Mississippi River began to move into Caddo territory in Spanish
Texas. These movements were in response to the increasing pressure to give up their traditional
livelihoods and become incorporated into Anglo-American culture (Everett 1990). The Spanish
initially welcomed these groups with the idea of using them to create a “buffer” between the
Spanish settlements in Texas and the land-hungry Anglo-Americans. Unfortunately, as more of
these groups (such as the Choctaw, Delaware, Quapaw, Shawnee, Cherokee, and AlabamaKoasati) moved into East Texas, they began increasingly to compete with the Caddo for a
diminishing resource base. This problem was exacerbated following the sale of Louisiana to the
United States in 1803, when Anglo-Americans began moving into Northeast Texas as well
(Perttula 1988a:21), and was not ultimately resolved until both the Caddo and most of the
immigrant groups were expelled following the Texas Revolution of 1835.

25

In the Neches/Angelina river region, the Hasinai Caddo likely encountered Europeans first in
1542 when the remnants of the Spanish de Soto expedition, led by Moscoso, entered their
territory. Their next contact with Europeans occurred in 1686 when the Frenchman La Salle
stayed several days in the Hasinai village of Cenis while searching for the Mississippi (Story
1982). The Hasinai, whose cultural area was centered on the middle Neches and upper Angelina
river valleys, were the most socially advanced and influential group in the region. The largest of
the Hasinai residential/ceremonial centers has been found at the George C. Davis site (41CE19)
in Cherokee County. Another important center has been identified at the Deshazo site (41NA27)
in adjacent Nacogdoches County. The term “Hasinai” means “our own people” and the term
“Texas” or “Tejas” (meaning “friend”) derives from the Hasinai form of greeting (Bolton 1987).
The Hasinai were organized in a loose confederacy composed primarily of the Hainais,
Nabedaches, Nacogdoches, Nasonis, Nadacos, Neches, Naconos, Nechauis, and Nacaos, but
membership apparently was fluid and fluctuating (Story 1990:322). An intertribal organization
pertaining especially to religious beliefs was the basis of this confederacy. At the top of a
relatively weak social and political hierarchy was the grand xinesi, along with the subordinate
chiefs of each tribe and their lesser officials (Bolton 1987; Story 1982:21). Although males
inherited these offices, females often held powerful positions and descent was likely through the
female line.
René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, established Fort Saint Louis on the Gulf coast in 1685
(John 1975:182). By 1686, he had traveled northward to Caddo country. Father Anastasius
Douay, a member of the La Salle expedition, reported on his observations of Caddo culture.
According to Douay, the Hasinai village of Cenis (an Allen phase [ca. A.D. 1650–1800] Caddo
settlement) was extremely large, but settlements within the village were dispersed into small
hamlets of 10 or 12 houses (Swanton 1942:39). The apparent reason for this housing
arrangement was to provide each family with nearby cropland and access to water for household
use and frequent bathing (Hatcher 1928:154). Subsistence was based on cultivated corn, beans,
calabashes, and sunflowers, along with the quickly adopted European watermelon. Seasonal wild
acorns, nuts, grapes, plums, persimmon, berries, roots, and herbs supplemented the cultigens, and
meat protein was obtained from fish, deer, bison, rabbit, birds, bear, snake, and turtle (Griffin
1954:110, 113; Swanton 1942:128, 132–133). Tools to procure these food items consisted of
stone dart and arrow points, woven baskets, pottery cooking vessels, and wooden mortars and
pestles (Story 1982:22). Shell, ceramics, stone, and salt were commonly traded over wellestablished exchange routes that long-preceded European contact. Funerary practices were
predicated on the status of the individual. The most elaborate ceremonies were held for the
xinesi, with the attendance of all members of the confederacy, and the least elaborate were for
simple members of the group. Although the dead were buried with bows, arrows, knives, food,
and domestic items, the status of the individual determined the items (Newcomb 1961:301;
Swanton 1942:203–204).
By the late 1600s, a regular European presence/settlement into Caddo territory had begun. In
1690 the Spanish established missions in the Hasinai area—San Francisco de los Tejas and
Santísimo Nombre de María—but abandoned them in 1693 when the local population refused to
comply with Spanish attempts to convert and control them (Swanton 1942:46–49). In response to
St. Denis’s 1714 French trading post at Natchitoches, three more Spanish missions were
established in 1716—a second Mission San Francisco de los Tejas just east of the Neches River,
and two in the main villages of the Hasinai (Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción, likely on
the Angelina River) and the Nacogdoches (Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, likely on Bayou La
Naña) (Swanton 1942:46–49). In 1779 a group of Euro-American settlers from the Trinity River
26

moved into the Nacogdoches area and a rancher set up operations on Bayou Loco near or on the
DeShazo site. These moves, as well as intruding Indian groups, forced the Hasinai to emigrate
westward to the prairie or to withdraw into smaller villages. The French briefly regained control
of Louisiana, only to lose it again in 1803 when President Jefferson bought the Louisiana
Purchase. The way was now open for intense American immigration, which effectively forced
the remaining Hasinai to move to a reservation on the Brazos in 1845, and then finally to Indian
Territory in Oklahoma in 1859 (Newcomb 1961:289; Swanton 1942:71–88).

EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The period of European exploration and settlement and the subsequent Euro-American and
African-American development of North Texas are briefly covered in the remaining portions of
this chapter. For more extensive treatments of this period in North Texas, see Peter and Cliff
(1990a: Chapters 3 and 7) and Peter et al. (1991:Appendix J).
The initial European penetration into the general area of North Texas occurred in the middle of
the sixteenth century (around 1542) when the survivors of the de Soto entrada, led by Luís de
Moscoso de Alvarado, entered Texas in their attempt to reach New Spain by land (Bruseth and
Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). Moscoso’s exact route is unknown, but archeological studies
indicate that he apparently traversed the Red River valley somewhere between present-day
Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas. The party crossed the Red River and journeyed
through Northcentral Texas to present-day Wichita Falls before returning to the Mississippi River
to travel to the Gulf of Mexico. Recent reconstructions of the Moscoso route through Texas
(Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991) equate the province of “Naguatex” with the Hatchel-MitchellMoores site complex in northern Bowie County, suggesting that from here the entrada moved
southwest through Bowie County to cross the Sulphur River somewhere in the vicinity of
Douglassville, where Wright Patman Lake is located.
In the late 1600s, the Spanish introduced the first of their missions into East Texas. The goal of
these missions was to remove the indigenous religions and to Christianize the native populations.
In 1690 the Spanish established missions in the Hasinai area—San Francisco de los Tejas and
Santísimo Nombre de María—but abandoned them in 1693 when the local population refused to
comply with Spanish attempts to convert and control them (Swanton 1942:46–49).
The French, led by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, first intruded into eastern Texas by
establishing Fort Saint Louis in 1685 (John 1975:182), and in 1714 St. Denis set up a trading post
at Natchitoches (in present-day Louisiana). Spanish fear of an increased French presence in
Texas led to the decision in 1716, to try again to establish a series of missions and presidios in
East Texas—this time a second Mission San Francisco de los Tejas near the Neches River,
Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción (later moved to the San Antonio area in 1731) on the
Angelina River, the Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe at present-day Nacogdoches, San Jose de los
Nazonis, and Nuestra Señora de los Ais, as well as San Miguel de Lineares de los Adaes in
present-day Louisiana—as a buffer against further French encroachment into that region (Cooper
et al. 2003; Pool 1975:28; Swanton 1942:46–49). When France and Spain went to war, the
French at Natchitoches attacked the Spanish settlement of Los Adaes, forcing the Spanish to
abandon the area once again (Newcomb 1961:288). After the truce in 1721, the Spanish
representative Marques de Aguayo persuaded the French to withdraw from Texas. He
reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital of the Province of Texas. After
briefly regaining control of the area, the French sold it as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.
27

In the Red River area, the French established Le Poste des Cadodaquious in present-day Bowie
County in 1719, and explored what is now Franklin County (Harper 2002). Benard de la Harpe’s
1719 trading post (which became known as the Nassonite Post) on the Red River north of
present-day Texarkana was the first European settlement in the Great Bend (Cooper et al. 2003;
Kelley and Coxe 1996:21). Another effort by Spain to curb French influence occurred in 1760,
when Fray Jose Francisco de Calahorra y Saenz led an expedition to present-day Rains County to
make peace with the Native American tribes in Northcentral Texas. These trading posts
eventually served as illicit trading centers between the two European colonies: modern-day
archeological investigations have yielded artifacts of Spanish and French origin that would
suggest that the different cultures interacted at the trading sites.
Following the sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803, Anglo-American immigration into
North Texas intensified, although for a number of years it was not clear who actually owned the
area south of the Red River. The United States considered it (and indeed, most of Texas) to be
part of the Louisiana Purchase, and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939).
Spain (and later Mexico), on the other hand, was violently opposed to this view, and at several
times during the first few decades of the nineteenth century the dispute nearly led to war (Smith
1991). The first official Anglo-American penetration of the region was by the Freeman-Custis
Expedition of 1806, which was turned back at Spanish Bluffs, along the Red River, by a Spanish
military force (Flores 1984).
Despite Spain’s claim, North Texas was too close to the United States not to fall into the AngloAmerican sphere of influence, and settlement continued. The earliest settlements were confined
to the areas immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed into the
prairies along river tributaries and early roads such as Trammel’s Trace and Dayton’s Road.
Trammel’s Trace, a popular immigrant route into Texas after 1813, crossed the Sulphur River at
Epperson’s Ferry and continued southwestward through Cass County to Hughes Springs, founded
in 1839, and then south to cross Cypress Creek two miles west of modern Jefferson (Webb and
Carroll 1952:2:793–794). Dayton’s Road was a major east-west overland route that ran along the
divide between the Sulphur and Red rivers.
The original Anglo-American settlers in Texas were largely subsistence farmers residing on small
holdings, with an economy based on grain and livestock production (Peter and Cliff 1990a:36).
The commercial production of cotton apparently was not introduced until the 1830s (Fehrenbach
1968), a shift that was accompanied by increasing numbers of slaves into the region. The town of
Jefferson, on Cypress Creek, was a major cotton market, and the antebellum planters throughout
the region undoubtedly sent their cotton there for sale (Peter and Cliff 1990a:39). Other major
industries established about the same time included tan yards and syrup mills; after 1857, railroad
construction also progressed westward (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198, 2:59).
As settlers began to move into Texas, they remained under first Spanish and then Mexican control
until the struggle for Texas independence in 1836. For the most part, North Texas was beyond
the direct sphere of the conflict involving the fight for Texas independence: that conflict played
out primarily in South and Central Texas in 1835 and 1836. The most significant change
thereafter involved decrees by President Mirabeau Lamar, the second president of Texas, to make
the settlers of the Texas Republic safe from marauding Native Americans by adopting an Indian
removal or extermination program. Active efforts to drive off or exterminate the Native
Americans in North Texas had been under way for some time. In one instance in 1837, a group
of Texas Rangers under the command of Lt. A. B. Van Benthuysen camped on Turtle Creek after
conducting raids on Indians to the north (Maxwell 2002). Subsequently, many native groups who
used the Trinity River basin relocated north of the Red River.
28

Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood in 1846, entering the union as the twenty-eighth
state. It did not remain a state for long. Sectarian politics were raised to a fever pitch during that
period, and after the presidential election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession. The
sympathies of most of the Anglo-American residents of North Texas lay with the secessionist
southerners; after all, a majority of them had immigrated from the South, the region as a whole
had a substantial slave population, and the cash economy of the area was built on slave-based
agriculture even though most of the individual farmers could not afford to own slaves. In most of
Northeast and Northcentral Texas, anti-Union feelings ran high (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306),
and nearly all the counties in the area voted to secede—though some, like Delta County, did
support Sam Houston’s Unionist forces during the early part of the war (McCroskey 1997).
Eventually, Texas became a part of the hard-pressed Confederate States of America.
Although the fighting never reached North Texas, the Civil War still inflicted hardships on the
region (WPA 1992:55–58). Because most able-bodied men were away fighting for the
Confederacy, most small towns and villages were left unprotected from and fearful of Native
American raids (Denton County History Page 2001). The result was an eastward retreat of the
frontier. Simultaneously, the region also experienced considerable immigration of Southerners
who were moving west to escape the warfare that ravaged the Deep South. The region gradually
became impoverished as the war progressed as food and other commodities became expensive
and difficult to obtain (WPA 1992:55–58).
North Texas escaped serious, direct effects from the Civil War, being too far from the centers of
fighting to the east and south to be affected by Union forces, and too far east of the frontier to be
affected by the resurgence of Native American problems that accompanied the withdrawal of
U.S. and Texas military forces (Pool 1975:110–113). The defeat of the South in 1865 brought
with it the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old slave-based plantation system, and
the presence of a Union army of occupation. The end of slavery brought many changes in the
economy of rural North Texas. Lacking the cheap and dependable labor resources provided by
slavery, the large plantations of the prewar period ceased to be economically feasible and many
were broken up and partially sold off. Most of the land put on the market found its way into the
hands of speculators and investors, with the result that a new system of sharecropping or tenant
farming replaced the old plantation system. Productive land was now often held by absentee
landlords, with the labor supplied by African-American or poor Anglo-American sharecroppers
or tenants. Although this system failed to improve the lot of the sharecroppers and tenants, it was
a successful replacement for the prewar system, and by the beginning of the twentieth century,
the bulk of the rural farms in Northeast Texas were operated by sharecroppers or tenants.
After 1870, the population of North Texas began to increase, and the region began to recover
from the worst effects of the war and the subsequent recession. One of the most important factors
in this recovery was the increasing role of the railroad in the regional economy. A small amount
of railroad construction had occurred prior to the outbreak of the war, when more than 50 miles of
track had been laid westward from Texarkana in 1857 by the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific
Railroad. Following the end of the war, construction did not resume for four more years. When
it finally did, it continued at a relatively steady rate. In 1871 and 1872, the Texas and Pacific
Railroad went through the southern corner of Upshur County and the eastern portion of Cass and
Marion counties. In 1876, the East Line and Red River Railroad (later part of the Louisiana and
Arkansas), building west from Jefferson, crossed western Marion County and the southwest portion
of Cass County. In the piney woods of northeastern Texas, the Houston, East and West Texas
Railway from Houston to Shreveport was completed in 1882, quickly followed by the Kansas and
29

Gulf Short Line, the Texas Southeastern, the Grovetop, Lufkin and Northern, the Texas and New
Orleans, and the Angelina and Neches River Railroad. In 1901 the Gulf, Beaumont, and Great
Northern Railroad as well as the St. Louis and Southwestern Railway had completed lines through
San Augustine County; and by 1902 the Eastern Texas Railroad was operating from Lufkin to
Kennard in southeastern Houston County, thus connecting the northeastern counties and opening
manufacturing/trade/transportation opportunities.
New towns emerged along these railroad routes and developed as important shipping centers
(Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306). The continuing expansion of the railroads after 1870, and the
improved communications they brought, spurred the development of other local industries as
well. During this period, lumbering assumed its place as an important industry in many areas of
the piney woods of northeastern Texas (Chandler 1937). The Houston, East and West Texas
Railway and the Gulf, Beaumont, and Great Northern Railroad allowed transportation of lumber
from timber-rich Polk, Angelina, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and Nacogdoches
counties. Sawmills to process this lumber also sprang up throughout these Northeast Texas
counties, especially in Lufkin and Angelina County, which led to innovations for lumber and
paper production, and provided another major source of employment (Webb and Carroll
1952:2:824). All of these mills helped supply raw material to factories located in Texarkana and
in other large towns (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198).
Following the arrival of the railroads, colleges and universities soon made their way to Northeast
Texas. Central College, a Methodist institution, was established in 1881 (renamed Eastman
College in 1895) in Sulphur Springs, the county seat of Hopkins County (Jennings 2001). East
Texas Normal College, later renamed East Texas State University (and now known as Texas
A&M University-Commerce), was established in Commerce, located 15 miles from Greenville,
in 1894. Stephen F. Austin State University was founded in Nacogdoches in 1923.
In spite of the steady growth in nonagricultural industries during these years, farming continued
to be important in Northeast Texas, with the small, owner-operated farm still prominent. Despite
the inequities of the sharecropper and tenant systems, the participants were not locked into the
system as had been the case under slavery, and in the last three decades of the nineteenth century
increasing numbers of African-Americans achieved the status of small landowners. They often
settled in dispersed rural communities separate from those of their white neighbors.
Between about 1920 and 1935, the rural population seems to have generally declined, although
the population of the region as a whole continued to grow (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198). Some
factors that may have influenced this demographic shift were the continued growth of urban
industries, the declining agricultural productivity of the land, and the depressed regional and
national economy. The discovery of oil in many North Texas counties in the 1930s led to the
development of new industries and increased employment, although the overall population of the
region continued to fall (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306, 2:144, 783).
The period following the end of World War II has been one of general prosperity and
urbanization for the entire region. Demographic changes within this area have been dominated
by the growth of medium-sized urban areas, including Tyler. Commercial patterns in the region
have benefited from the construction of Interstate Highways 20 and 30 that have served to link
the area to major manufacturing centers to both the east and the west. The improved
infrastructure, as well as the construction of several lakes in the area, also has brought increased
prosperity in the form of tourism and the recreation enterprises. In spite of this growth,
30

agriculture and livestock continue to play a major role in the regional economy (Fox 1980:1).
The timber industry remains perhaps the major industry. The forests of the area, in addition to
lumber and paper production, have created a significant tourist industry.

BRIEF HISTORY OF THE TYLER POUNDS REGIONAL AIRPORT
Property for the airport was first acquired by the city of Tyler in 1929 and consisted of 296 ac
(Anonymous 1985). Prior to the city’s purchase of the property, a tenant who resided on the
property farmed the land. Construction of the airstrip began in 1929 and was conducted by a
combination of WPA crews and civil employees using city-owned road-grading equipment.
When the airport opened for business in 1930, it consisted of an 800-square-ft hangar building,
2,500 ft of unpaved runway, a small parking area, and an underground fuel storage tank. By
1934, the facility was known as Rhodes Field and consisted of a 3,000-ft gravel runway and a
newly installed lighting system. In September of that year, air mail and commercial passenger
service were established and continued until World War II. In 1942, the United States
government assumed control of the facility and used it to train pilots for the U.S. Army Air
Corps. Barracks and other structures were constructed on the west side of the property. One of
the larger structures briefly served as a nursing home after the war. The airfield was renamed
Pounds Field in honor of Army Air Corps pilot Lt. Jack Pounds, who was the son of a prominent
Tyler banker and had been killed in the war. The Army Air Corps added several improvements to
the facility during its tenure by upgrading existing buildings, adding new runways and a taxiway,
and expanding parking areas.
The city resumed control of the airfield in November 1945 and continued to operate a modest
commercial passenger service. Between 1979 and 1981, the facility expanded to 1,049 ac, and
improvements were made that included lengthening one of the three paved asphalt runways,
upgrading equipment, and renovating the terminal building. In 1981, the facility was again
renamed to Tyler Pounds Field to eliminate confusion about the airport’s location. The most
recent improvement was the construction of a new terminal building in the late 1990s (Davis
Dickson, personal communication, 2007). The airport continues to offer commercial passenger
service linking Tyler to airports in surrounding major cities.

CHAPTER 4
METHODS

Prior to field investigation, documents held at the Texas Historical Commission (THC) were
examined to better estimate the potential for archeological sites within the project area. The
THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was consulted to determine if archeological sites
had been recorded within 1 mile of the project area. Three sites (41SM15, 41SM60, and
41SM242) were identified within this radius, although information about each site is extremely
limited. Sites 41SM15 and 41SM242 are plotted within the present airport boundary at the north
side of the facility. Site 41SM15 occurs in the northeast corner of the airport. According to the
sites atlas, Jack Hughes investigated the site in 1941, but no information about the site type, site
size, or work conducted is offered. Site 41SM60 occurs 0.94 miles north of the airport. The site
is prehistoric, possibly Late Archaic, and yielded stone flakes and the base of a biface; however,
no other details are mentioned on the site form (Taylor 1977). No site form was available for site
41SM242, which is plotted near the northwest corner of the airport. However, a search of project
report abstracts on the sites atlas indicates that AR Consultants identified the site in late 1998
during a reconnaissance survey of 200 ac of airport property (Skinner 1998). The site consists of
parts of a World War II army airfield barracks.

FIELD METHODS
The project area consists of the forested area south of the existing runway within and along the
southern airport boundary, a strip southwest of the existing runway that extends southwest of the
airport boundary, a road realignment southwest of the airport, and a road realignment outside the
southeastern airport boundary. Fieldwork consisted partially of reconnaissance survey (i.e.,
visual examination) of the project area to assess whether areas had potential for archeological
materials and could be physically accessed. Based on observations in the field as well as data
from soils and topographic maps, the majority of the project area underwent intensive pedestrian
survey. For this type of survey, segments of the project area were traversed and shovel-tested in
regular intervals. The linear portions of the project area at the end of the runway and along road
realignments were surveyed by two archeologists along a single transect, and shovel tests were
excavated at 30-meter [m (100-ft)] intervals. The forested area at the south side of the airport was
surveyed by two to three archeologists spaced at 30-m transects. Shovel test intervals were
typically 30 m, although they were expanded to 40 m in areas determined have a low probability
for archeological materials because of disturbance and/or topography. This area was subdivided
33

into segments circumscribed by features such as roads and drainages to make both execution of
the survey and interpretation of the paperwork and results more manageable (see Figure 2).
Clockwise, these smaller survey areas on the south side of the airport were defined as follows:
1) West Forest—The rectangular area in the southwest portion of the wooded area is
bounded to the south and east by the airport property fence.
2) Northwest Forest—The area directly north of the northwest corner of the south property
fence is bounded to the south by the fence, to the west by a large drainage, and to the east
by an oblique access road.
3) North Forest, East Lobe—This segment is directly east of the Northwest Forest and
defined to the east by the access road, to the south by the property fence, and to the west
by a northwest-to-southeast–trending drainage.
4) North Forest, West Lobe—The area includes the forested property east of the abovementioned drainage.
Individual shovel tests were generally 30-centimeters [cm; 12 inches (in)] in diameter and
excavated in 20-cm (8-in) levels to 80 cm (31.5 in) below ground surface or subsoil, whichever
was encountered first. All fill was sifted through ¼-inch hardware cloth, and any recovered
artifacts were placed in bags labeled by survey area, transect number, shovel test number, and
depth/level. Data regarding artifacts, soil color, and soil texture for each shovel test were
recorded on a standardized form. If a shovel test was positive, additional shovel tests were
excavated in 10-m (33-ft) intervals in each of the cardinal directions until a sterile shovel test
occurred to determine if a site was present and its extent. All sites, including shovel tests and
relevant cultural and geographical features, were mapped with a Trimble Pro-XRS global
positioning system (GPS) device, as well as a pace and compass sketch.

LABORATORY METHODS
After fieldwork was complete, recovered artifacts were returned to the GMI laboratory facility in
Plano, Texas. There, all artifacts were washed in tap water and allowed to air dry. Bag numbers
were assigned to each provenience, and lot numbers were assigned to the provenience and bag
units. The Project Archeologist performed the artifact analysis.
During analysis, unique artifact numbers were assigned within each provenience in order to
identify the artifact(s) represented by one record in the project database. In some cases, more
than one artifact was assigned to the same artifact number when equivalent analytical
characteristics were defined. The artifacts were labeled, using white and black India ink, with the
site number, lot number, and artifact number; the label was then sealed under a coat of polyvinyl
acetate (PVA) varnish. Data regarding artifacts were recorded on coding sheets, which were later
transcribed into a Microsoft Access 97 database, as described below.
The project database was developed in Microsoft Access 97 and normalized into four tables: (1)
all artifacts, (2) bag list, (3) photographic log, and (4) project information. The project
information table contains the GMI project number and project name. It is linked to both the bag
list and photo log tables. The photo log table contains all of the photographic information for the
project. Its main use is to generate clean photo logs for curation. The bag list stores the project
provenience information transcribed from the paper bag-list maintained during fieldwork.
Finally, the all artifacts table contains the artifact descriptions and is linked to the bag list table by
way of the bag numbers.
34

CURATION
Artifacts retrieved from shovel tests were retained for study. All original archeological materials,
notes, forms, and maps were retained and stored temporarily at GMI offices in Plano for the
duration of the analysis and reporting phases. Following the completion of all analyses and the
acceptance of the final report, all artifacts, samples, records, photographs, forms, and field notes
will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin.

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The following chapter discusses the results of the archeological survey and provides
recommendations based on the findings. Survey areas are addressed individually below.

SURVEY RESULTS

Runway Extension and Light Relocation
This roughly 2,425-ft-long strip extends from the southwest end of an existing northeast-tosouthwest–trending runway (Figure 3). The proposed segment occurs partially within the present
airport boundaries and partially along pasture and grassland south of Pleasant Retreat Road
(Figure 4). The segment within the airport property fence indicates several patches of red (2.5YR
5/8) sandy clay loam subsoil at the surface (Figure 5), and a series of five shovel tests
corroborated the absence of topsoil in this area. Only one shovel test, excavated near the south
fence, produced a relatively undisturbed soil profile consisting of 10 cm (4 in) of pale brown
(10YR 6/3) sand above light yellowish brown sand. Yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) sandy clay
subsoil was encountered at 40 cm (16 in) below ground surface (bs). No artifacts were observed.
This last shovel test was at a lower elevation than the previous ones, and apparently not on the
portion of the airport that has been artificially filled to elevate and level the runways. A small
pond at the base of the elevation also separated this shovel test from the others farther northeast.
The remainder of the proposed runway extension is south of the present airport facility on the
opposite side of Pleasant Retreat Road in pasture and open grassland (Figure 6). A small stream
lined with young hardwood trees and greenbrier understory crosses the project area
approximately 60 m (198 ft) southwest of the end of the proposed extended runway, and a wood
and metal storage structure occurs directly southeast of the project corridor (Figure 7). The
structure, however, is recent and does not merit consideration as a historical structure. Ground
terrain rises southwest of the steam and descends again toward a small paved road (CR 1141).

Twelve shovel tests were excavated along the segment south of Pleasant Retreat Road, and no
archeological materials were identified (see Figure 4). Shovel test profiles typically consisted of
20 cm (8 in) of brown (10YR 5/3) to pale brown (10YR 6/3) loamy fine sand above brownish
yellow (10YR 6/6) compact loamy fine sand with ferrous gravels. A layer of strong brown
(7.5YR 5/6) compact sandy clay loam with ferrous inclusions was typically encountered 45–
60 cm (18–24 in) bs.

Pleasant Retreat Road Realignment
The proposed 4,925-ft realignment will extend southwest of CR 1184 at its intersection with CR
1185, connect with existing CR 1141, curve southeast, and resume a northeast course to connect
with Pleasant Retreat Road (see Figures 2 and 4). The presently unpaved portions of the corridor
extend primarily through pasture and open grassland, although the southwest end of the southeast
alignment cuts across a portion of a residential property (Figure 8). The house and outbuilding in
this area are directly southeast of the proposed road, but are recent and do not merit consideration
as historic structures.
Topography along the northwest alignment (Figure 9) was generally level, although the ground
surface was undulating, and a forested area depicted on a recent aerial photograph as occupying
the southwest half of the alignment is no longer present. Seventeen transect shovel tests were
excavated along this segment (see Figure 4). Soil profiles revealed 10–30 cm (4–20 in) of brown
to yellowish brown (10YR 5/3–5/4) sandy loam above strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) frequently

compact sandy loam. Yellowish red (5YR 5/8) compact sandy loam subsoil was only
occasionally encountered above 80 cm bs, when most shovel tests terminated. All shovel tests
were sterile except Shovel Test (ST) 15, near the southwest end, that produced a piece of
whiteware 20–40 cm (8–16 in) bs; however, the four delineation shovel tests were sterile, and the
object is considered to be an isolated find.
The southeast alignment (Figure 10) gradually ascends to the northeast, descends toward the same
stream that crosses the end of the proposed runway extension, and gradually ascends and levels
off toward Pleasant Retreat Road. The areas sloping toward the stream are forested with young
hardwoods. The southwest end of this segment crosses a residential property and was not shoveltested due to adequate ground exposure and disturbances from driveways, landscaping, and an
underground sprinkler system (Figure 11). The first shovel test (see Figure 4) was excavated
immediately northeast of this property in open grassland on a terraced upslope, and a quartzite
flake was recovered 30–50 cm (12–20 in) bs. A delineation shovel test to the south produced
another flake 0–30 cm (0–12 in) bs. All other delineation shovel tests (n=3) were sterile, and any
shovel tests farther south would have been outside the project corridor. Exposed areas on the
adjacent property were visually inspected, however, but no other artifacts were observed. The
property to the south was disturbed by residential structures and a buried sprinkler system, and
the slope had been terraced. Therefore, if a site had existed in the area, it has probably been
destroyed. Another consideration is that the two flakes might have migrated from the top of the
landform, which would be a more favorable location for a site. Consequently, the positive shovel
tests are considered a nonsite locality. Twenty additional transect shovel tests were excavated
along the southeast alignment. All were sterile, and no archeological features were observed.

Soil profiles generally consisted of 10–15 cm (4–6 in) of (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam above 10–
50 cm (4–20 in) of light yellowish brown to brownish yellow (10YR 6/4–6/6) sandy loam
underlain by strong brown (7.5 YR 5/8) sandy clay.

Dixie Road Realignment
Presently, Dixie Road extends south of SH 64 along the east side of the airport for roughly 0.8 mi
before it veers to the southeast. The proposed realignment would begin about 300 ft north of the
present turn-off, extend southeast for approximately 1,000 ft before reconnecting with the
southeast segment 250 ft to the southwest (Figure 12). The proposed alignment extends along a
grass pasture south of a residence (Figures 13 and 14). Like the other structures observed near
the project area, it was constructed recently enough to not be of historical significance. The
terrain along the project area gradually descends southeast into an ephemeral stream and
gradually ascends in the same direction. Ten shovel tests were excavated along the proposed
alignment corridor (see Figure 12). Soils consisted of 50–70 cm (20–27.5 in) of light yellowish
brown (10YR 6/4) slightly compact ferrous fine sandy loam above strong brown (7.5YR 5/8)
very compact sandy loam. All shovel tests were sterile, and no archeological features were
observed.

West Forest
This survey area is directly west of a tributary of Indian Creek, and two channels of the tributary
partially dissect it (see Figures 1 and 2). Terrain slopes gently toward these channels and to the
larger stream to the east. The area is predominantly forested with hardwood trees and saplings—
particularly oak, elm, and sweetgum—interspersed with a few evergreens. Most of the trees
appear to be less than 40 years old, although a few mature oak and juniper trees are in the central
portion of the survey. Secondary vegetation consists of a dense understory of greenbrier, as well
as Spanish dagger, scrub trees, and a few prickly pear plants. Leaf cover reduced ground surface
visibility to less than 10 percent. Grass cover was infrequent. Although the majority of this area
underwent intensive pedestrian survey, a 4.3-ac triangular area at the north end consisted of a
large drainage basin and downward slope to the basin (Figure 15). Because it presented a low
probability for archeological sites and presented access problems, this portion of the West Forest
was not surveyed. However, the cutbanks of the drainage were examined for artifacts, features,
and paleosols. None were observed.
Fifteen east-to-west transects were surveyed over a 16.36-ac area, resulting in 83 shovel tests (see
Figure 15). Sixty-three of these consisted of transect shovel tests, and 20 others were delineation
shovel tests. In four instances, delineation shovel tests served as transect shovel tests or vice
versa. Soils in the southern nine transects were usually yellowish brown, pale brown, or light
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 6/3, or 6/4) fine sandy loam, occasionally underlain by brownish
yellow (10YR 6/6) compact sandy loam with a few ferrous inclusions. The northern six transects
were more commonly characterized by 20–30 cm (8–12 in) of very pale brown (10YR 7/4)
compact sandy loam above strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) sandy clayey loam with occasional ferrous
gravels. Several pushpiles and timbered areas were observed within the survey area, indicating
prior disturbance. Two archeological sites (41SM386 and 41SM387) and one nonsite locality
were discovered as a result of the archeological investigations. A quartzite flake was recovered
40–60 cm (16–23.5 in) bs in ST 4 of Transect 4. The shovel test was excavated to 1 m (3.3 ft) in

depth with no other artifacts encountered. Delineation shovel tests to the east, north, and west
were sterile; however, a shovel test 10 m (33 ft) to the south produced another, smaller quartzite
flake 60–80 cm (23.5–31.5 in) bs. This shovel test was also excavated to 1 m (3.3 ft) bs with no
additional artifacts. An additional shovel test 10 m (33 ft) farther south produced several historic
artifacts 40–50 cm (16–20 in) bs and a piece of quartzite shatter 80–95 cm (31.5 in–37.5 in) bs.
The historic materials consisted of 22 fragments of thin folded metal, possibly from a can, 11
fragments of clear bottle glass, and a base of an ash tint glass from a fruit jar with a patent date of
1903. Several small pieces of strong brown clay were observed when the upper levels were
screened, suggesting ground disturbance. A sterile shovel test 10 m (33 ft) south of this one was
sterile but also indicated disturbance, and several spoil piles were also observed on the ground
surface. This area is not considered to be a site because of the observed ground disturbance and
the paucity of artifacts. Two other locations within the survey area produced several historic
artifacts and are considered archeological sites. Each is discussed below.

41SM386
Site 41SM386 (Figure 16) is on an elevation at the south end of the survey area near the
southwest corner of the tree stand, west of a tributary of Indian Creek (see Figure 15). A small
roughly east-to-west channel of the tributary occurs 60–80 m (198–264 ft) north of the site.
Ground surface slopes slightly to the south. Vegetation consists of relatively young hardwood
forest with a dense understory of greenbrier, and leaf cover is extensive over the ground surface.

The site measures approximately 40 m (132 ft) north-to-south by 20 m (66 ft) east-to-west and
consists of a north-to-south line of four positive shovel tests containing historic domestic and
architectural materials and two possible features (Figure 17). The potential for a site was first
recognized when ST 5 of Transect 2, on the east side of the survey area, yielded a machine-cut
iron nail (1840-1880), a round or oblong piece of thin metal forming a base with shallow sides, a
piece of light green window glass, fragments of a rectangular clear glass (post-1880) bottle, a
piece of whiteware (post-1880), and a piece of stoneware with a Bristol glaze on the interior and
exterior (post-1900) in the upper 40 cm (16 in). The shovel test is in a depressed area, and an Lshaped berm or pushpile, roughly 5 m (16.5 ft) north-to-south by 5 m (16.5 ft) east-to-west occurs
1 m (3.3 ft) east of the shovel test (Figure 18). Blocks of mortar-covered sandstone and a piece of
an asphalt shingle were observed on the east leg (Figure 19). Another pushpile occurs about 5 m
(16.5 ft) west of the shovel test, and a depression 1 m (3.3 ft) in diameter lies on its west side. It
is uncertain if the depression is cultural, but it could possibly represent a filled well or privy. A
delineation shovel test 10 m (33 ft) to the south was sterile. As a result of trying to navigate
through and around the dense greenbrier, ST 5 of Transect 2 veered into Transect 1 roughly
between STs 4 and 5 of that transect. Both were sterile and constituted the east and west
delineations. Three additional shovel tests to the north also produced artifacts until a sterile
shovel test was finally encountered. Recovered materials include a square piece of thin metal
from a can or tin; clear (post-1880) bottle glass fragments, including a piece that has been
partially melted; a fragment of an iron machine-cut nail (1840-1880); a piece of whiteware from
the base of a plate or platter; and two pieces of stoneware. Both have an Albany slipped interior,
although one has a Bristol exterior (1890–1915), and the other has a gray salt-glazed exterior
(1865–1915). Deposits extended 0–60 cm (0–23.5 in) bs.
Recovered materials date from the late 1800s to early 1900s. According to airport manager Davis
Dickson (personal communication, 1997), the airport was an Army Air Corps training base
during World War II with barracks, latrines, and other structures. However, these structures were
located on the west side of the airport, several hundred meters away from the site. Site 41SM242
was recorded in the northwest part of the airport in the late 1990s and consists of a portion of
these barracks (Skinner 1998). Also, the recovered artifacts here at this location tend to predate
the 1940s. Mr. Dickson did note that the wooded property has been used for dumping, and that
portions have also been timbered. A brief report on the history of the airfield noted that prior to
its sale to the city, the property was farmed and a tenant lived on the premises (Anonymous
1985). The location of the residence on the property is not known, however. It is uncertain
whether the sandstone blocks and artifacts represent the razed remnants of a domestic structure or
if the area is a secondary dumping site. As such, 41SM386 demonstrates poor contextual
integrity and limited research potential, and is not considered eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places or for listing as a State Archeological Landmark.

41SM387
Site 41SM387 (Figure 20) is in the central portion of the survey area on an elevation west of a
tributary of Indian Creek (see Figure 15). Smaller, perpendicular channels are present 60–90 m
(198–297 ft) north and south of the site. The ground surface slopes slightly to the south.
Vegetation is predominantly young hardwood forest, although several mature oak and juniper
trees are present, and leaf cover is extensive over the ground surface. Spanish dagger plants are
also common along the ground surface. An unpaved east-to-west–trending access road extends
across the northern portion of the site. The site is immediately west of the east tree line of the
forest.

The site measures approximately 25 m east-to-west by 65 m north-to-south and consists of a
series of positive shovel tests containing historic domestic and architectural materials (Figure 21).
The first positive shovel test encountered was ST 4 of Transect 8 near the east side of the survey
area. The shovel test produced a piece of stoneware with an Albany slipped interior and exterior
(1870–1930) from 20–40 cm (8–16 in) bs. A large chunk of sandstone was also encountered in
the upper 20 cm (8 in) of the shovel test. A shovel test 10 m (33 ft) to the north produced a piece
of aqua bottle glass and a rim sherd of manganese/solarized container glass (1880–1920) in the
upper 20 cm (8 in) of the shovel test. A machine-cut nail was recovered 20–40 cm (8–16 in) bs
10 m (33 ft) farther north, and a depression measuring 70 cm (27.5 in) north-to-south by 90 cm
(35.5 in) east-to-west was approximately 5 m (17 m) to the west. It is uncertain if the depression
is cultural, natural, or a more recent man-made disturbance. The next shovel test north was
sterile; however, a 50-cm-by-50-cm (20-in-by-20-in) sandstone block was visible on the ground
surface immediately south of the road and west of the edge of the east tree line approximately 15
m northeast of the shovel test (Figure 22; see Figure 21). The block could represent part of a
foundation pier, although no other sandstone blocks were observed in the vicinity. Nonetheless, a
shovel test about 8 m to the northwest in the northeast corner of the tree stand contained historic
artifacts. This shovel test produced the greatest number of artifacts at the site. A wire nail (post1890); several pieces of metal from an oblong tin, possibly a tobacco tin; 13 pieces of clear
container glass (post-1880); one piece of manganese/solarized container glass (1880–1920); a
fragment of a porcelain vessel; and two fragments of redware were recovered 20–40 cm (8–16 in)
bs. The 40–60-cm (16–23.5 in) bs level produced two fragments of clear container glass (post1880) and a piece of light blue tinted whiteware (1880-1930). A shovel test 10 m (33 ft) to the
west was sterile; however, ST 4 of Transect 11 on the north side of the road yielded a piece of

manganese/solarized container glass in the upper 10 cm (4 in) of the unit. A piece of corrugated
metal was also observed on the ground north of the road near the east edge of the tree line.
Shovel tests north, south, east, and west of ST 4, Transect 11, were sterile.
Recovered materials date from the late 1800s to early 1900s. Airport manager Davis Dickson
(personal communication, 2007) noted that the airport had been an army base during World War
II with barracks, latrines, and other structures. However, these structures were located on the
west side of the airport, several hundred meters away from the site. Also, the recovered artifacts
tend to pre-date the 1940s. He did note that the wooded property has been used for dumping, and
that portions have also been timbered. A brief report on the history of the airfield noted that prior
to its sale to the city, the property was farmed and a tenant lived on the premises (Anonymous
1985). The location of the residence on the property is not known, however. It is uncertain
whether the observed materials represent the razed remnants of a domestic structure or if it is a
secondary dumping site. Overall, the site suggests poor contextual integrity and low-density
artifact deposits that limit the research potential of the site. Therefore, 41SM387 is not
considered eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for listing as a
State Archeological Landmark.

Northwest Forest
The survey area is on a landform flanked to the east and west by tributaries of Indian Creek,
although only the west tributary demarcates this particular survey segment, and terrain slopes
gently toward this channel (see Figures 1 and 2). Vegetation is mostly hardwood forest
54

intermixed with some pine forest. Spanish dagger and prickly pear commonly occur along the
ground surface, which was generally covered with dead leaves and pine needles, although grass
covers small portions of the survey area. Greenbrier understory is present in places, but it is less
dense than in the West Forest. The area was surveyed in 12 east-to-west transects. Forty-nine
transect shovel tests and four delineation shovel tests were excavated (Figure 23). Shovel test
profiles typically consisted of pale brown (10YR 5/3), pale light brown (10YR 5/4), or very pale
brown (10YR 7/3) fine loamy sand that became more compact with depth, and typically became
too dense to dig through effectively by 60 cm (23.5 in) bs. Soils at the north end of the forest,
toward the runways, typically lacked topsoil, and yellowish red (5YR 5/8) sandy clayey loam was
present at the surface. One machine-cut nail (1840-1880) was recovered from the upper 10 cm (4
in) of in ST 2 of Transect 1; all four delineation shovel tests were sterile, however. All other
shovel tests were sterile as well, and no archeological materials or features were observed on the
ground surface, although timbered areas were encountered.

North Forest, West Lobe
This survey area occurs on the same landform as the Northwest Forest (see Figures 1 and 2).
Terrain is generally level on the west half, but the east half descends toward the east tributary of
Indian Creek. A paved parking area, two radio towers, and an equipment building occupy the
southwest corner of the survey. The remainder is a mixed forest of hardwoods and pines, with
most of the pines occurring in the west half of the survey area. Greenbrier is common and growth
is particularly dense toward the creek drainage. Occasional Spanish dagger and prickly pear
plants occur along the ground surface, which is generally covered with dead leaves and pine
needles. However, grasses are present in the few clear areas. Several berms and pushpiles were
also observed within the survey area (Figure 24), indicating previous disturbance. The area was
surveyed in 15 east-to-west transects. Because of the observed disturbances, shovel test intervals
were expanded to 40 m (132 ft) after the first six transects, although transect width remained at
30 m (100 ft). Fifty-nine shovel tests were excavated in this area (see Figure 23). Shovel test
profiles generally consisted of dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/6), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), or
light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam. Very pale brown (10YR 7/4) compact fine sandy
loam was frequently encountered between 50 and 70 cm (19.5 and 27.5 in) bs. A 10–60-cm (4–
23.5 in) layer of brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy loam occasionally occurred between these
two strata. No artifacts were recovered from any of the shovel tests, and no archeological
materials or features were observed on the surface.

North Forest, East Lobe
The survey area (see Figures 1 and 2) slopes moderately to the southwest toward the east tributary
of Indian Creek. Forest vegetation is a mixture of young hardwood and pine trees, grasses in the
few open areas, scrub, and extremely dense thickets of greenbrier. The thick greenbrier made
navigation through the survey area extremely difficult, and, as a result, only three east-to-west
transects were attempted. Fifteen shovel tests were excavated (see Figure 23), and soil profiles
were similar to those encountered along the West Lobe. All shovel tests were sterile, and the
general topography of the survey area indicated an extremely low potential for archeological sites
due to its location partially on a slope and partially in a low-lying area. Vegetation is recent and
suggests that undisturbed sites, if any at all, are unlikely. No archeological materials or features
were observed on the visible ground surfaces, and felled trees were present along the east side
near the north end.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Approximately 103.24 ac of city-owned and private property were examined by reconnaissance
and intensive pedestrian survey for proposed improvements to the Tyler Pounds Regional
Airport. Excluding delineation shovel tests (n=24), 186 shovel tests were excavated within the
survey areas. Much of the surveyed property within the current airport boundary indicates
disturbance from timbering and construction of runways and other airport facilities; lowprobability site areas, particularly those descending into minor drainages, were noted along the
northeast and northwest extremes of the forested area in the southern portion of the airport.
Disturbances from land clearing and construction of residential structures were also observed on
surveyed properties outside the present airport facility. Two nonsite localities were documented
within the existing airport boundaries, and two were identified along segments of the proposed
realignment of Pleasant Retreat Road southwest of the present airport. These materials lack
context and research value. Two previously unrecorded historic sites (41SM386 and 41SM387)
were identified in the forested area in the southern part of the airport facility. However, both
demonstrate low-density artifact deposits and present contextual issues. In particular, both
potentially represent secondary depositions rather than primary occupation/activity areas.
Because of their poor contextual integrity and limited research value, neither site meets the
criteria for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for listing as a State
Archeological Landmark. No additional archeological investigation is necessary, and it is
recommended that the proposed project be allowed to proceed.

APPENDIX A
FRAMEWORK FOR HISTORIC ARTIFACT ANALYSIS

The analysis of the historical material makes use of the classification system developed by South
(1977). It consists of the following four major analytical categories or classes of artifacts:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Domestic
Architectural
Personal
Activities

Unidentifiable metal fragments and ceramic or glass sherds that cannot be classified as to
category are placed in a separate “Indeterminate” category. Major artifact categories are sorted
into various subcategories, including tableware, food storage, and furnishings. These are then
sorted into various classes, types, and subtypes, depending on the type of subcategory and
material type. In the case of ceramics and glass, these subtypes are associated with manufacture
or use dates whenever possible. The general nature of each of the major artifact categories is
discussed below.

Domestic Artifacts
The domestic category includes artifacts related to food service (i.e., tableware) and food storage
(including food preparation). The tableware subcategory subsumes some ceramic, glass, and
metal artifact types. Ceramic tablewares include stoneware, refined earthenware, coarse
earthenware, and porcelain types. Particular items are identified as to types and subtypes, based
on temporally sensitive technological (e.g., white/whiteware, light blue tint whiteware, blue tint
whiteware, blue tint ironstone, high-fired ironstone, ironstone/whiteware, transitional whiteware),
decorative (e.g., decalcomania, flow blue, blue shell edge), and/or other attributes (e.g.,
nonvitrified, vitrified, molded), and are assigned dates of production on this basis.
Food storage items or storagewares are also subdivided as to whether they are ceramic
(stoneware), glass, or metal. The stoneware items are further subdivided into types and subtypes
using technological and decorative attributes such as paste (e.g., colored) and various
combinations of exterior treatment (e.g., gray-bodied, Bristol, cobalt, slipped, Albany slip, natural
slip) and interior treatment (e.g., blue gray, Bristol, slipped, Albany slip, unglazed). These
attributes form the basis for assigning production dates to individual specimens.
Glass storageware is subdivided on the basis of color (e.g., clear, manganese solarized, ash tint,
amber, light amber, brown/amber, opaque, cobalt blue, blue, aqua, light green, ruby); form
(generally bottle); and either decorative characteristics (e.g., etched, embossed, stippled base),
manufacturing attributes (e.g., mold-made, machine-made, press-molded), or sometimes function
(e.g., soda, beer/liquor, canning seal, depression glass, extract bottle). Individual items are given
artifact-specific dates based on the production dates for each of its various attributes, in
combination.
The furnishings subcategory includes all nonfood service or food storage-related household items,
such as furniture, stoves, and lamp glass. The furnishings subcategory often comprises only a
small proportion of the total identifiable historical artifact assemblage from rural sites, and the
actual recovered items may vary greatly. In many cases, the majority of the artifacts classified as
furnishings consist of fragments of lamp glass.

Finally, it should be noted that not all ceramics or glass artifacts fall within the domestic category.
In some cases, artifacts of these materials belong within the architectural or activities categories.

Architectural Artifacts
The architectural category includes all items that could be related to buildings or structures.
Subcategories of architectural items include such things as window glass, nails, brick, mortar
and/or plaster, ceramic tile or pipe, and electrical items. Nails are further subdivided as wrought,
cut, or wire; and brick is distinguished as handmade, machine-made, or high-fired.

Personal Artifacts
The personal item category includes items of individual use such as clothing, buttons, shoes, doll
parts, cosmetic bottles, snuff bottles (identified on the basis of characteristics such as glass color,
bottle shape, and lip shape), musical instruments, and smoking pipes. Usually, artifacts that can
be classified in this category are rare, making this the least frequently represented category at
most historic archeological sites.

Activities Artifacts
The final analytical category of historic artifacts relates to activities items. This category includes
all nonhousehold items such as those associated with transportation activities, weapons, and farmrelated equipment. As with personal items, this category often makes up only a small proportion
of the overall assemblage of identifiable historic artifacts from a site. Activity category items
include truck or tractor parts, harness buckles, fence staples, fence wire, horseshoes or horseshoe
nails, and firearms cartridges. Subcategories for activities items include tools, harness and
equipment, transportation, machinery, farm-related, weapons, and coal.
