FOREWORD: ALEX D. KRIEGER AND CADDO ARCHAEOLOGY
Timothy K. Perttula
Alex D. Krieger (1911–1991) had a long and distinguished career as a North American archaeologist. His
first archaeological work was in the Great Basin in California and Oregon, but in 1939, Krieger took the position
of Supervisor of the University of Texas Works Progress Administration Laboratory in Austin, Texas (Story
1993:615). For the next 17 years (1939–1956), he worked at The University of Texas, and “within a remarkably
short period of time, became a nationally recognized authority on the archaeology of east Texas and adjacent
areas” (Story 1993:615).
Dee Ann Story (1993:615) has noted that:
Working closely with the late Clarence H. Webb, Alex developed an encompassing cultural-historical
framework for the interpretation of southern Caddoan prehistory by the early 1940s. Although it has been
considerably modified over the years, this scheme greatly advanced Caddoan archaeology and is still
one of the better examples of the application of the Midwestern Taxonomic System. It was complemented
by the Caddoan ceramic typology also formulated by Krieger and Webb. Because [of] their discerning
definitions, most of these pottery types continue to be used, often with little modification.

Several of Krieger’s publications on Caddo archaeology remain influential to this day, including Culture
Complexes and Chronology in Northern Texas (Krieger 1946, reprinted in 2009 by Gustav’s Library), The
George C. Davis Site, Cherokee County, Texas (Newell and Krieger 1949, reprinted in 2000 by the Society for
American Archaeology; see Story 2000:1), and “An Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology” (Suhm et al.
1954, reprinted in 2008 by Gustav’s Library). To my mind, Alex Krieger is the father of Caddo archaeology; he
helped fostered my own research interest in Caddo archaeology when I was a graduate student at the University
of Washington in the mid- to late 1970s, just as he has kindled interest and archaeological inquiry, based on his
writings, for a number of past and present Caddo archaeologists.
In 1993, Krieger’s archaeological library and papers were donated to The University of Texas at Austin
(Krieger 2002:xv). Among those papers was an unpublished and undated manuscript entitled “Archaeological
Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area,” apparently written and finished in early 1944 (based on citations in the
manuscript). Krieger made mention of this manuscript in the now classic Culture Complexes and Chronology
in Northern Texas (Krieger 1946:11, 124, fn16), describing it as a manuscript that served to internally organize
the archaeology “of this great region and its affiliations with the Southeast in general.” He even published a short
summary of the larger work in the proceedings of the Third Round-Table Conference of the Sociedad Mexicana
de Antropologica held in Mexico City on August 25–September 2, 1943 (Krieger 1944a:154–156). Nevertheless,
for reasons unknown, this 187 page manuscript was never finalized for publication, although parts of it—in
revised form—found its way into various sections of Culture Complexes and Chronology in Northern Texas
(Krieger 1946).
In a very real sense, Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area represents a foundational
work in Caddo archaeology by Alex D. Krieger in his attempts after 1941 to organize and understand, through the
use of the Midwestern Taxonomic System (McKern 1939; Lyman and O’Brien 2003) and his perspectives of
artifact typology (Krieger 1944b), the culture history of the Caddo Indian peoples that lived in northeastern Texas,
southwestern Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and eastern Oklahoma in prehistoric and early historic times. In
this same work, he examines cultural connections between the Caddo and aboriginal populations in Mexico, the
southwestern United States, the Great Plains, and the Southeast, framing problems and perspectives developed
more fully in Culture Complexes and Chronology in Northern Texas (Krieger 1946). His approach is a “balancing of archaeological minutia and the big picture” (Story 2000:5).
The organizational framework of Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area is as follows.
Krieger begins with a review of previous archaeological work that is relevant to culture-historical problems within
what is recognized as the Caddo area. He then presents a summary of the number of archaeological complexes
identified within this general region based upon the Midwestern Taxonomic System of terminology—including
v

component, focus, and aspect (McKern 1939)—among them at least 12 foci belonging to two temporally distinct
aspects or periods. The earlier aspect is the Gibson Aspect, and Krieger identifies five foci within it: Spiro, Haley,
Gahagan, Alto, and Sanders. The later Fulton Aspect includes the McCurtain, Texarkana, Belcher, Titus, Frankston,
Shelby (no longer in use, and replaced in part with the Angelina Focus [Jelks 1965], also not in current use), and
Glendora (later redefined to include only certain Historic [post-A.D. 1650] components [Suhm et al. 1954:157]),
but also not in current use by Caddo archaeologists) foci.
Much of the text is taken up with discussion of the archaeological traits that distinguish the foci and aspects
from each other, along with a consideration of the cultural-historical relationship of these foci among themselves
and within each of the two aspects. Although later characterized as chronologically naive (Suhm et al. 1954:157),
Krieger suggested, based primarily on temporal estimates current in the Southeast and in the absence of radiocarbon dating, still years away—where sites with Southern Cult paraphernalia were thought at that time to date to
the time of the DeSoto entrada (A.D. 1542) (Ford and Willey 1941)—that the Gibson Aspect dated from ca. A.D.
1400–1550 and the Fulton Aspect dated from ca. A.D. 1600–1700. He does further suggest that the Gibson
Aspect foci are contemporaneous with the Coles Creek period defined in the lower Mississippi River valley, a
point of contention for years, but a finding that has been basically borne out through archaeological research since
Krieger’s time. Krieger at the time, because of the foreshortened chronologies in use in the Southeast in the
absence of radiocarbon dating, considered the Caddo to have a “very shallow archaeological depth…and the
origin of the Caddoan stock is as yet unknown” (Krieger 1944a:155).
Krieger also considers in this work the possible ethnic identification of the cultural-taxonomic units he
recognized within the Caddo area. Although he concedes that the pottery tradition developed in the Gibson
Aspect continued into the foci of the later Fulton aspect, differences in mound building activities, use of copper
and conch shell, and the disappearance of large multiple burials from Gibson to Fulton Aspect times, led to his
skepticism that the Gibson Aspect foci represent the archaeological remains of southern Caddo peoples. Here is
where the single-minded focus on a trait list approach was not up to the task of cultural-historical analysis. If
nothing else, more than 65 years of archaeological and bioarchaeological studies that have been completed in the
Caddo area since Krieger wrote Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area have shown the
cultural and biological intertwining of both early (ca. A.D. 800–1400), late (ca. A.D. 1400–1700), and historic (ca.
A.D. 1700–1840) Caddo sites, assemblages, cultural traditions, populations, and societies.
Lastly, this paper concludes with an extended discussion of the relationships between these Gibson and
Fulton Aspect cultures in the Caddo area and certain recognized archaeological cultures in Central Texas, the
Southwest, the Plains (including the Henrietta Focus and the Panhandle Aspect), the Southeastern States, and the
Gulf Coast and Mexico; these same topics are considered in great detail in Culture Complexes and Chronology
in Northern Texas, with Extension of Puebloan Datings to the Mississippi Valley (Krieger 1946:221–272).
Krieger concludes that there were contacts and trade relationships between Caddo peoples and ancestral Puebloan
groups living on the Rio Grande in New Mexico, but could find no concrete evidence for contact between the
Caddo and aboriginal groups living in Mexico.
In summary, and in his own words, what Krieger tried to accomplish, and mostly succeeded in doing given
the then current state of archaeological knowledge, in writing the Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called
Caddo Area was “to gather together the bits of information which can be gained from a number of site reports,
localized comparisons, and a great many unpublished collections, and to weld these into an interpretive scheme.
One gets the impression that a rather great amount of digging has been done without any greater aim than to find
more and better ‘Caddoan’ specimens. It has been obvious for some time that the prehistory of this part of the
continent would have much to offer toward the welding together of major sections of the United States and
Mexico. Therefore the present paper may provide a step toward breaking the paralysis which has enveloped this
region, point out various possibilities for research, and aid field men of the future in matters to be checked in the
excavations…the reader will doubtlessly wish for a fuller knowledge of each focus before the interpretations will
seem substantial. This presents a difficulty which can hardly be completely remedied, for the cultures themselves
and the material collected are dispersed over four states, not to mention what has been carried elsewhere…If this
paper aids in the coordination of these and related works, it will serve its purpose.”

INTRODUCTION

T

his paper1 presents some of the outstanding evidence of cultural depth and diversity which can
now be recognized in the extensive archaeological region long known as “Caddoan.” For generations amateurs and professionals alike have amassed great numbers of specimens from the rich sites in this region, yet
no analysis on a comprehensive basis has ever been
made. Not even an approximation of the territory to be
included in the term “Caddoan” has been defined. In
general, it appears to cover the adjoining sectors of
Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas, an area
drained principally by the Neches, Sabine, Sulphur, Red,
and Arkansas river systems. The presumption is that
this was the homeland of closely related speakers of
one branch of the Caddoan linguistic stock, namely,
the “Caddo proper,” “Southern,” or “Red River” branch.
So it is that archaeological remains from an area of
some 160,000 square miles have traditionally been
dubbed “Caddoan” almost without regard for the implications of such a term. However, it may be granted
that the term has a certain geographical usefulness,
for it denotes a block contrasting both physiographically
and culturally with the southern Plains on the one hand
and the lower Mississippi valley on the other, as well
as with the Ozark uplands on the north and the Gulf
Plain on the south.

Rather than attempt to define the working area
first, I shall let the previous literature and the present
archaeological scheme speak for themselves, then approach the distribution of the southern Caddo speakers
from the standpoint of remains which may rather certainly be allocated to them and their immediate ancestors. The organization is based upon the McKern or
Midwestern system of terminology, which for the purposes of the present study has been found as satisfactory an implement for expression and discussion as any
yet proposed. Many points are conjectural; the identification and provenience of intrusive trade objects serving to cross-date the cultures is not always satisfactory; there is the usual need for more data and especially for far more comprehensive field notes. Nonetheless, many points of broad interest in American prehistory can now be seen rather clearly and should be
set forth. Elaboration, corroboration, and correction will
no doubt be forthcoming eventually, and while it is impossible to present all the supporting evidence on hand,
the present interpretation promises to bear substance
and should stimulate more direct investigation in the
future.
I wish to point out that I emphatically do not regard trait listing and schematic diagrams as the end
products of research. These devices should serve one
purpose: that of keeping the record straight, so that
investigators can view the material in its proper perspective, avoiding careless comparisons between specimens or phenomena which actually belonged to different associational complexes separated by time or space,
or both. A simplified breakdown is a visual aid to research. It is not, however, a reconstruction of history,
for the latter should amount to a complete recording of
events and processes, stimuli and reactions, modifications and adaptations within the limits of the information recoverable. This is the subject for a future work
on this area.
“Trait lists” such as those given here serve mainly
to point out obvious contrasts in total assemblages of
cultural practices. These aggregates represent material which is consistently found in association in both
time and space, and it perhaps does not matter greatly
whether each item can be accurately termed a “cultural trait.” The lists given here are not complete for

The discussion will proceed as follows:
1. Review of previous work bearing on problems
within the “Caddo area.”
2. Presentation of a number of cultural aggregates or
foci within this general region, belonging to two
distinct time periods.
3. Discussion of the relationship of these foci among
themselves and within each of the two time periods.
4. Discussion of the possible ethnic identification of
the cultural units recognizable within the “Caddo
area.”
5. Discussion of the relationship and chronology between these cultures in the “Caddo area” and certain recognized cultures in central Texas, the Southwest, the Plains, the East-central and Southeastern States, and the Gulf Coast and Mexico.

each cultural aggregate, but are merely guides to the
content of each such entity or “focus.” It is possible
for the same type or trait to be “diagnostic” of two or
more foci, for it is only the associational combination
of many items that defines a given cultural entity, never
any particular ones.
The most serious deficiency in the “Caddoan
area” is the general lack of reliable field notes and
stratigraphic data. In the 600 or so sites studied (exclusive of Oklahoma) in preparation for the present interpretation, direct superimposition of distinct cultures, with
reliable notes, is found in just three cases (Hatchel,
Belcher, and Crenshaw), yet these serve as pivots for
the alignment of whole masses of material. In addition
to these keys, the historical scheme is supported by
distributional consistency of the focal associations, by
direct association of traits and types in the same graves,
and by the recognition of intrusions which bind the foci
together into two distinct groups or aspects. It has been
necessary to consult the published literature with an
extremely critical outlook, for it has been the persistent
lack of a critical attitude that has led to the perpetuation of erroneous generalities about “Caddoan” archaeology. Wherever possible, the original specimens and
notes have been examined, for no matter how well or
how poorly these have been described in print, there is
no satisfactory substitute for first-hand study.
No direct evidence in support of the interpretation given here has yet appeared in print. The focus
and type names are those of the writer except as credited in the text. In many cases I have reinterpreted
previous works in terms of the present scheme. There
are, of course, certain theoretical objections to the cov-

ering of such a field by one worker, but in lieu of more
direct checks the reader may re-read the published
papers to determine whether the present scheme is
borne out by the facts. This is not entirely satisfactory,
however, for many significant points have been neglected in the literature and were only turned up by the
broader inter-state investigation. Briefly, the material
used was this:
1. Approximately 4,000 complete or restored vessels,
150,000 sherds, and 7,000 other artifacts from about
600 sites in north, east, and coastal Texas, all in the
collections of the University of Texas; field notes
on about 100 of these sites.
2. The private collections and notes of Judge Harry
J. Lemley, Hope, Arkansas; M. P. Miroir,
Texarkana; Clarence H. Webb, Shreveport, Louisiana; Frank H. Watt, Waco, Texas; and Adolph
Henry Witte, Henrietta, Texas. These men have
done outstanding work in their areas. Their notes
and photographs reflect considerable knowledge
of archaeological problems and methods, and are
eminently reliable.
3. Superficial examination of collections at Louisiana
State University, more detailed examination of
those at the University of Oklahoma, with information furnished by David A. Baerreis. Also collections in Heye Foundation, Ceramic Repository,
National Museum, University of Tennessee, Laboratory of Anthropology, Museum of Northern New
Mexico, Teotihuacan (Mexico), etc.
4. The literature, consisting of some 40 archaeological and 30 ethnological-historical sources.

PREVIOUS WORK

the continued confusion of engraved and incised
decoration; the common practice of designating as
a “site” any miscellany of camps, graves, “mounds,”
houses, etc., which happen to lie within sight of
one another, although they may be strung over a
half mile or more along a stream; and such inept
terms for projectile points as “bird point,” “war
point,” “microlith,” etc. Harrington (1920) classed
all projectile points from southwest Arkansas as
“arrow points,” dividing them into “the diminutive
type” (true arrow points) and “the large type” (atlatl
dart points). The first group included at least ten,
and the latter at least six, culturally distinct styles,
yet so great was his influence on subsequent workers that projectiles have ever since been classed
as “small” or “bird points,” or “large,” and we can
gain little or no further information about the specific shapes. Again, there are references to
“bunched” burials, here meaning flexed burials,
there meaning bundles of reburied bones.
4. The complete lack of anything resembling an acceptable pottery typology until the very recent work
of Louisiana State University and Clarence H.
Webb of Shreveport. Their work provides a reliable anchor in the southeastern sector of our general area, but outside of that, “types” have been
imaginative groupings with no reference to the position of the specimens in time, space, or associative complex.
5. The fundamental concept of intrusive versus resident material has not heretofore been recognized.
Specimens are “usual” or “unusual;” “the common Caddo type” or “very rare in this county,”
etc. Obviously no analysis is comprehensive unless intrusions or trade objects, with their probable
sources, can be recognized in relation to the materials with which they were found.

n order to explain the general confusion and sterility which have long characterized archaeological
thinking in the so-called “Caddo area,” it is necessary
to give a brief outline of previous work. Only those
papers which may be said to illustrate the trend of research are considered. The following points constitute
the main deficiencies which have run through these
works:
1. The general assumption that the entire territory from
northeastern Oklahoma nearly to the Gulf, and from
the Brazos River nearly to the Mississippi, was
occupied by speakers of the Red River or “Proper”
branch of the Caddoan linguistic family, and that
therefore all the archaeological remains therein
were left by “Caddoan” tribes, and constitute
one archaeological complex.
2. Collecting has commonly been pursued for the sake
of more and better “Caddoan” specimens, rather
than for information.
3. The lack of critical evaluation of previous work
has kept the same generalizations and ambiguous
terms perpetuated. For example, the term “mound”
has been applied to every sort of eminence above
ground level, regardless of size or whether it was
intentionally built or merely an accumulated camp
midden. In Texas alone probably less than one percent of the sites called “mounds” were actually
built purposely.2 This applies to archaeological features, not to mention the tens of thousands of small
“mounds” in some regions which have been shown
to be erosional phenomena (Rich 1934). It does
not help to read that “mounds” were “artificial,”
for this generally means simply that they were mancaused, not specifically built structures. This matter is of special importance in the understanding of
the real position of Caddoan-speaking peoples in
southeastern prehistory. Hereafter, I will refer to
those heaps which give evidence of intentional
construction as tumuli, without implying that they
were made specifically for burial purposes, although
some of them evidently were.
Further examples of damaging and sterile practices may be seen in: the general belief that engraved pottery is automatically of Caddoan origin;

Briefly reviewing the literature, we may note the
following: the voluminous works and beautiful illustrations of C. B. Moore are well known to all archaeologists in the Southeast. He assumed that all or most of
his discoveries in the Red and Ouachita valleys represented Caddoan peoples, but as he never attempted to
analyze his splendid collections, he can be regarded as

exempt from blame for future misconceptions.
The first work to be taken seriously from the
interpretive standpoint was Harrington’s Certain
Caddo Sites in Arkansas in 1920. For over twenty
years it has served as a virtual guidebook to “Caddoan”
archaeology. In spite of numerous hints that differences
were apparent in the material gathered from some of
the “sites,” he concluded that it was all “Caddoan,”
with the differences explained by local variation or by
the social status of persons buried with extraordinarily
rich offerings (see Harrington 1920:66–67, 100, etc.).
The ethnographic section is valuable in many ways and
is directed toward the interpretation of the archaeological data in terms of historic information. It should
be noted, however, that out of some sixty “sites” excavated, not one yielded any evidence of historic contact,
and therefore the tie with ethnographic notes is at best
indirect.
A few years later Fowke (1928:405–406) made
a brief reconnaissance of Red River sites. His view of
the Caddo is interesting:

construction of flat-topped tumuli with Caddoan
peoples, a point then contrary to accepted opinion. On
the other hand, most of the countless “mounds” described by Fowke and others (Thoburn 1931) over this
region have been conclusively identified as a natural
phenomena called “pimpled plains” (Rich 1934).
Thoburn (1931) was apparently convinced that
the great tumuli, as well as the engraved pottery, elaborate copper work, carved conch shells, and stone pulley-shaped ear spools of the middle Arkansas valley
were the work of “Caddoan” artists. A careful reading
of his paper reveals the fact that this belief was based
mainly on the contrast between what Thoburn called
“Siouan” and “Caddoan,” i.e., a northern and southern
contrast in eastern Oklahoma.
In 1932 Pearce (1932a, 1932b) presented two
papers summarizing the general run of archaeological
remains in different parts of Texas, as seen by explorations of the University. The work had been primarily
pursued for the collection of museum specimens, but
Pearce did foresee rather clearly the main contrasts
between Plains, Mississippian, and coastal cultures.
The Caddoan tribes are referred to as the “agricultural, village-dwelling tribes of East Texas.” Materials
from the T. M. Sanders site in Lamar County, Texas,
are described briefly in both papers as “unusual” in
Texas because of multiple burials, carved conch-shell
gorgets, and distinctive pottery.3
In 1934 Jackson published “Types of East Texas
Pottery,” which despite its title is not a typology but a
listing of miscellaneous observations on 2000 selected
grave vessels and pipes. The lists are organized on a
county basis which conforms to no conceivable cultural grouping, and the lumped tables apply to specimens from at least five distinct Foci.
In 1935 Goldschmidt published the first work in
the eastern Texas field that reveals a sense of archaeological problems. He denied that the method used by
Jackson would yield reliable results and rejected the
latter’s premise of four “sub-cultures” in the Red, Sulphur, Sabine, and Neches valleys:

…It is now an established fact that the
small mounds so numerous over much of
Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas,
extending in great numbers down the Red
River to Alexandria, and sparsely even
beyond that point, are the work of the
Caddoans. The latter tribes so far as we
know, did not erect the quadrilateral or
flat-topped mounds such as are prevalent
to the eastward. This leaves unexplained,
as yet, the comparatively few such
structures found along the Red River,
always near the stream, reaching up the
valley nearly or quite to Texarkana. These
may be due to the Natchez, or others, who
once lived there for a time but left no
further traces…through his (Rev. Owen)
generous cooperation it was possible to
visit every known site from Belcher, 20
miles north of Shreveport, to Gahagan,
40 miles south, and as far as 15 miles from
the river on both sides…Nothing was
found that would appear to be worth
excavating; meaning thereby that the
historical, scientific, or museum value of
any discoveries that might result from
digging out the mounds would not be of
sufficient value to justify the time and
expense involved in such work…

…The grouping of materials, first by
county and then by river system, without
previously determining whether this
grouping is established by the plotting
of the distribution of the various culture
traits and complexes and by statistical
analysis, is not, in the opinion of the writer,
justified…(Goldschmidt 1935:90).

Despite this dismal conclusion he described
briefly the shape of several large tumuli in the vicinity
of Shreveport. Interestingly, he did not associate the

Goldschmidt described the University of Texas
excavations in five Titus County sites: T. B. Caldwell,
4

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

A. P. Williams, William Farrar, W. A. Ford, and George
L. Keith. The first four were burial and midden sites,
the fifth a large rectangular, flat-topped tumulus with
no evidence of burials. The Caldwell and Williams sites
proved very similar and may now be considered pure
Titus Focus components. The Farrar and Ford sites
contained burials which, like all those of the Titus and
surrounding Foci, were single, extended on the back,
and provided with pottery vessels. However, these
graves lacked the diagnostic Titus Focus types such as
Ripley Engraved pottery and Talco Triangular and
Bassett Pointed Stem arrow points.4 The presence of
Canton Incised pottery and large crude projectiles of
type Gary Contracting Stem make the identification of
these burials uncertain at present, but it is significant
that at the Ford site they were cut through by a later
deposition of three burials containing unquestionable
examples of shell-tempered Texarkana Focus pottery
(Nash Neck Banded, Simms Engraved, Avery Engraved). Although Goldschmidt lacked the present Focus and type concepts, he clearly recognized the later
deposition of one distinct complex (the Texarkana Focus) cutting through an older one.
The Keith “mound,” a truly artificially constructed
eminence, contained evidence of “several successive
building stages” and had been built over a midden and
house site. Among other things Goldschmidt notes that
“The absence of curvilinear designs finds no exception
among the many decorated pieces.” It is clear that the
Keith tumulus represents a third complex in eastern
Texas.
In 1932 Vaillant pointed out many interesting resemblances in vessels of “Central and North America.”
Although he used vessels illustrated by Holmes, Moore,
and Harrington, he does not state that these were
Caddoan, only that:

Following Vaillant, Mason elaborated somewhat
on the possibilities of archaeologically demonstrable
connections between “the United States and Mexico”
(Mason 1935). This work was mainly concerned with
the possible Mexican origin of Texas coastal pottery,
but Mason also claimed a continuous connection from
Mexico through Texas to the “Caddo tribes.” He associated effigy pottery of eastern Arkansas with
Caddoans and stated that “The mounds of the Arkansas region are generally ascribed to the ancestors of
the present Caddoan tribes,” a view held by many anthropologists. Eastern Arkansas effigy pottery is now
generally considered “Middle Mississippian” and not
Caddoan, and the same now seems to be true of these
tumuli.5
Sayles’ Archaeological Survey of Texas appeared in 1935. He recognized three complexes which
pertain to the present problem: the Red River, Hasinai,
and Wichita Phases.6 His trait lists for the most part
state that “Red River Caddo” was “similar to Hasinai.”
The “Hasinai” list (Sayles 1935:Table 7) contains such
items as “house and burial mounds,” “finely chipped
triangular points,” “double-bitted chipped stone axes–
hoe?,” “small, circular bowl mortar,” “shell tempering
in pottery,” “copper-covered stone and clay, spool
shaped ear and lip plugs,” “stone ‘sinkers,’ ” “scapula
hoes,” “boat and banner stones,” and “quartz crystals.”
To the best of my knowledge not one of these features
has been found in the Neches valley, commonly regarded as the homeland of the Hasinai confederacy,
although most of them do occur farther north in what
may now be called the Sanders and Spiro Foci. Burial
and house mounds, copper-covered ear spools, and
scapula hoes are especially associated with the latter
foci and are totally foreign to the Frankston Focus,
which I believe represents prehistoric Hasinai culture.
Stone “sinkers,” boat stones and banner stones are foreign to all of these Foci and apparently do not belong to
the Mississippi pattern in Texas. In short, the “Hasinai”
list combines traits that may now be associated with
the Frankston, Titus, and Texarkana Foci of the Fulton
Aspect, and the Sanders and Spiro Foci of the Gibson
Aspect, the latter representing a generally earlier horizon than the former. These statements do not detract
from the value of Sayles’ “Survey” for central and
western Texas, where his interpretation was based on
more extensive and reliable data.
Ford’s three papers in 1935 provided the first
attempts to organize and interpret lower Mississippian
archaeology. It is to Ford’s great credit that the general scheme advanced for Louisiana has held up substantially to the present, giving reliable aid on the south

…in the valleys of the Ouachita River in
northern Louisiana, of the Red, Arkansas,
and St. Francis rivers of Arkansas, and of
the central Mississippi, there exists a
complex of ceramic traits that bears
relatively little relation to the pottery made
by the different mound cultures east of
the Mississippi and along the northern
reaches of that river from Iowa and
Missouri into Wisconsin…(Vaillant
1932:10).

He was certainly incorrect in grouping all the
valleys mentioned into “a complex” but the total contrast between valleys west and east of the Mississippi
is apparent.

and east to the problems of “Caddo” prehistory. We
may note especially that he regarded the Caddoan
material as very late, appearing just before or during
the first historic contacts, along with Tunica, Natchez,
and Choctaw; that is, at roughly 1700 A.D. Caddoan
culture itself is stated to be “unidentified.”
In 1935 Walker’s “A Caddo Burial Site at
Natchitoches, Louisiana” also appeared. This work is
of special significance in the Caddo problem for it provides the first clue to a definite association between
a known Caddoan location and a distinctive pottery complex. The outstanding facts at this site are: no
mounds; burials single, extended on back, heads easterly; head deformation; pottery placed around head and
upper body; engraved designs combined with shell temper and distinctive bowl and bottle shapes. Walker traces
the Caucasian history of the site, probably first visited
by de Tonti in 1690, and later the site of the French
post of Natchitoches, established in 1714. Noting that
certain of the vessels recovered are nearly identical to
some illustrated by Moore (1909) from the historic
Glendora and Keno sites in northeastern Louisiana, the
Douglas and Greer sites on the Arkansas River (Moore
1908), and the Battle site on the Red River in Arkansas (Moore 1912), Walker made the first reliable start
toward distinguishing a specific, tangible Caddoan complex. This can now be called the Glendora Focus, a
name first suggested by Orr (1941).
Walker also noted that the Douglas vessels
“came from a mound, but Moore makes it quite plain
that the mound was originally built for domiciliary purposes and later used as a cemetery—hence the presence of supposedly Caddo burials, which were probably intrusive at a later date.” And again: “The pottery
found by Harrington in the southwest corner of Arkansas and believed by him to be Caddo in origin shows
only slight resemblance to that found at the
Natchitoches site.” His explanation for this is: “But
there is much greater range of variation in the Arkansas vessels in both shape and ornamentation and a
greater elaboration of design, which is just what might
be expected if we are here dealing with the Grand
Caddo tribe, the leader of the confederacy of which
the Natchitoches and Ouachita were more outlying
members.” This “greater range of variation” is completely negated by the fact that Harrington’s material
came from a great number of sites which can now be
shown to represent diverse cultures belonging to two
or more time periods. Then, too, none of Harrington’s
sites contained any historic materials; neither is there
any evidence that any or all of the sites can be identified with the “Grand Caddo,” wherever they were lo-

cated. Walker’s conclusion is especially significant:
…Furthermore, none of the vessels found
from this or the sites at Glendora and
Keno Place was found in mounds, and in
cases where this type of pottery has been
reported from mounds, it has been proved
almost without exception that such
burials were intrusive in nature.
Apparently, therefore, the tribes that had
reached this height of ceramic perfection
were no longer builders of mounds, if
indeed they had ever been such. The
close similarity in type between the Red
River and Ouachita specimens is
explained by Tonti’s account of finding
the “Ouasita and Nachitoches” together
at the latter’s village, and also by La Fon’s
map of the territory of Orleans in 1806, on
which the old trading path from
Natchitoches to the villages on the
Ouachita is plainly shown (Walker
1935:15; italics mine).7

Smith’s “The Pottery Horizons of Texas” in 1936
was intended to show the principal contrasts in ceramics from different sections of Texas. The brief statements on “the Caddoan peoples of the Northeast sections of Texas” merely summarize the lists of Jackson
(1934) already mentioned.
The same year Jackson (1936) reported on the
A. C. Saunders site in Anderson County, which he
called “A ‘Perpetual Fire’ Site” because of a great ash
heap found near a midden. The paper is interesting
because of the very large circular house and the artifacts illustrated. The latter fairly represents what we
now call the Frankston Focus, but it is not certain that
the ash heap was directly connected with the house
and midden. The pottery and artifact “types” are subject to the same lack of typological perception already
noted; on re-examination the percentage differences
of various items for the three arbitrary excavation levels prove to be of no consequence.
Ford’s well known work of 1936, “Analysis of
Indian Village Site Collections from Louisiana and Mississippi,” greatly elaborated upon his 1935 papers. Respecting his “Caddo complex” (Ford 1936:72–97), the
13 sites named in his table (Ford 1936:97) yield some
important facts. None contained a burial mound, but a
site named Mound Place had four “pyramidal” mounds
less than 10 feet high. The latter place is said to have
“Caddo, Tunica, and Coles Creek” complexes, and in
view of other data the tumuli would appear to belong
to the Coles Creek culture. The Wilkinson Place con6

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

tained gun flints, glass beads, and vessels practically
identical (Ford 1936:Figure 17) to one illustrated by
Walker (1935:Plate 4a). The Allen Place in
Natchitoches Parish also yielded burials with historic
objects and a village site. The historic occupation of
Wilkinson and Allen may belong to the Glendora Focus. 8
Ford’s treatment of the “Caddo complex” served
mainly to round out the picture for Louisiana, and he
apparently was fully aware of the general lack of reliable data for its definition. Nevertheless he employs
such phrases as “the recognized Caddoan burial wares”
and “typical Caddo complex material,” which we must
assume apply to all northwestern Louisiana materials
other than Coles Creek and Tunica.
In the 1936 publications of Lemley and Dickinson
we see the first recognition of an archaeological horizon distinct from anything that might be construed as
Caddoan. Lemley’s work on the Crenshaw site on Red
River in Arkansas was carried on in Mounds B and D,
which had previously been partially explored by Moore
(1912). Moore had found three burials in Mound C,
none in A and E, and five in each of B and D. Moore
seems not to have seen anything very unusual about
these finds, but Lemley discovered that the true tumuli
B and D were built over several huge grave pits containing multiple burials laid parallel and extended, with
copious ceramic offerings. After the tumuli were built
over these graves, other large graves for similar multiple burials were dug through the tumuli to such great
depth that they penetrated into and even below the
initial graves which had been dug into the subsoil.9
Judging from Lemley’s illustrations (the writer
also examined the vessels in December 1942), the pottery from the great sub-tumulus graves belongs to three
types, French Fork Incised, Coles Creek Incised, and
Coles Creek Plain, all of which were typologically described after Lemley’s paper appeared.10 The interesting implications of this discovery in terms of relationships through Coles Creek to western Florida have been
discussed by Dickinson (1936).11
The terminology used by Lemley partially obscures the true meaning of the Crenshaw site. He called
the sub-tumulus grave complex just mentioned the “PreCaddo,” and everything later than this “the usual
Caddo.” In the light of complexes recognizable elsewhere it can be established that the “Caddo” part of
the Crenshaw material belongs to two distinct foci, and
Lemley’s own notes bear this out. For we find in Mounds
B and D two separate sets of large multiple graves,
both containing skeletons laid parallel in rows and across
the ends of the graves. However, those graves dug

into the mounds from above bear a totally different
pottery from those dug into the subsoil previous to the
mound building. This upper grave complex clearly belongs to what is here called the Haley Focus and is
thus related to the Spiro, Gahagan, Alto, and Sanders
Foci of the Gibson aspect. There is still a third complex
in these mounds, which can probably be referred to a
very late prehistoric Caddoan people. The third complex is seen in the occurrence of single extended burials, with vessels around the head and shoulders, in small
rectangular graves dug into the fields between the tumuli
and into the tumulus surfaces. The pottery, pipes, and
projectiles in these last graves represent types belonging to the Texarkana and Belcher Foci. There was thus
a carryover in the making of large multiple graves from
the Coles Creek “Pre-Caddo” into the Haley Focus,
but the pottery types changed abruptly. Both these complexes are clearly distinct from the last, surface occupation.12
Dickinson (1936) accepted the terms “PreCaddo” and “Caddo” and went on to describe “two
distinct cultures” along the Bayou Maçon “in mounds
and campsites.” Beneath a culture with shell-tempered
pottery which he related to Ford’s Natchez he found
pottery which “in vessel forms, temper, and paste” is
similar to the “Pre-Caddo.” The earlier pottery was,
however, predominantly cordmarked, hence
Deasonville (Ford 1935a, 1935b, 1936) rather than
“Pre-Caddo” or Coles Creek. In 1937 Lemley and
Dickinson reported Marksville sherds from Bayou
Maçon, and both Marksville and Coles Creek types at
the Kirkham site in southwestern Arkansas. They cite
similarities between the Crenshaw “Pre-Caddo” and
the Kirkham site, but at the former place there is no
Marksville pottery, and at the Kirkham place there is
no grave data. Dickinson (1936:67) had, however, earlier suspected some roundabout relationship between
Marksville and early Crenshaw.
However complex the prehistory of southwestern Arkansas, it seems clear that nothing construable
as prehistoric “Caddoan” ware has been found as far
east as the middle and lower Ouachita River. In historic times Caddoan (Glendora Focus) pottery was
carried into the Natchez area on the Mississippi
(Quimby 1942), and conversely, historic Natchez pottery (Fatherland Incised) reached eastern Texas as an
intrusion in Glendora Focus sites. Ford and Willey
(1940:132) note a probable brief residence of Caddoan
peoples at the Crooks site near the lower Ouachita
River, judging by sherds on the mound surfaces, “very
shortly before 1700 A.D.” Thus far, then, we have an
apparent eastern boundary for the study of “Caddoan”
7

the Fulton Aspect. The fourth or bottom level at the
Belcher site clearly belongs to a different culture, for it
lacks the conch shell beads and pins, the pearl beads,
pottery figurines, and carved conch shell dippers found
in the upper level burials; the fourth level house is totally different from those in the upper three levels, being rectangular with wall trenches, central clay fire basin,
and extended entranceway (Webb 1940).
South of Shreveport the rich Gahagan site has
been excavated by Moore (1912) and Webb and Dodd
(1939). The latter did not assign this site to the Caddoan
peoples but listed some of the surface remains as
“Caddoan” because of their similarity to Belcher upper levels. It now seems certain that the Gahagan conical burial tumulus with its very large graves, multiple
burials extended in rows, grave offerings placed along
the walls, wealth of copper work including repoussé,
human hand and bear claw effigies and masks, spatulate celts, recurved flint blades of “Copena” form, longstemmed pottery pipes, and distinct pottery types with
Coles Creek intrusions, defines a distinct focus. This,
the Gahagan Focus, bears definite relationship to the
Alto Focus in East Texas,14 the Haley, and the Spiro
Focus, all of the Gibson Aspect.
Dickinson (1941) described vessels from the historic Clements site in northeast Texas. Though badly
looted, this site contained several graves with glass and
iron objects, and several excellent examples of bottles
and jars (Dickinson 1941:Plate 19) which unquestionably belong to the type Natchitoches Engraved as found
at Natchitoches (Walker 1935), the Wilkinson and Allen
places (Ford 1936), certain graves from an open field
near the Battle place mound (Moore 1912), the
Glendora and Keno sites (Moore 1909), and the surface intrusions at the Douglas and Greer sites on the
Arkansas River (Moore 1908). In all or most of these
sites appears another type featured by closely spaced
trailed lines arranged in gracefully curved patterns (see
Moore 1909:Figures 9, 10, 11, 14–15, 18–19, 22–26,
55, 81, 86, 129–130, 141, 145, and Plate VIII). This
can be named Keno Trailed, and is closely linked with
Natchitoches Engraved. They are not always found in
historic sites, for some graves at the Culpepper and
Hunt sites in eastern Texas containing them lacked
evidence of Caucasian contact. Presumably the sites
farther west were inhabited at about the same time as
those showing contact, but the contacts had not quite
reached them. Dickinson’s paper adds to this assemblage of historic sites which can now be included in the
Glendora Focus.
From 1939 to 1941 University of Oklahoma archaeologists published some brief reports on the more

archaeology: it would run north and south between
Ouachita River and Bayou Maçon in historic times,
but some distance west of Ouachita River in prehistoric times, a movement eastward at about the time of
first contacts being discernible, i.e., at about 1680–1700
A.D. (Figure 1).
In 1939 and following years the important contributions of Webb and Dodd of Shreveport went far
toward a more objective understanding of Caddo prehistory. Their 1941 paper on Belcher site pottery represents the first acceptable typological analysis from
anywhere within the area west and north of Ford and
Quimby’s studies. In their Gahagan report (Webb and
Dodd 1939:111) they present a summary of traits widely
believed to define Caddo material culture:
The typical Caddo culture was rich in
pottery, decorated with the scroll, the
circle and semicircle, the sun design and
the spiral—all curved line decorations.
Decorative elements include hatched and
cross-hatched spaces, spurred lines,
impression of pigment into lines and
engraving after firing. Ornaments
included beads, pendants and large
carved gorgets, ear and hair ornaments
made of shell and bone. Grooved and
ungrooved celts, small points made from
flakes, the square stemmed blade and the
pitted pecking stone were widely used.
Mounds were raised by the Caddos for
both structures and burials, contrary to
the opinion expressed by Walker and
others that the Caddos did not build
mounds.

We see here the tendency to speak of THE
Caddo as though there were but one ethnic group and
one archaeological complex over the entire area ascribed to them. As we shall see, several of the traits
mentioned apply to the Belcher Focus but not to other
foci within the area. Intentional construction of the
eminence at the Belcher site is indicated by Webb’s
excellent notes and diagrams. The four strata correspond to as many house constructions. The first house
was built when the surrounding floodplain was some
five feet lower than at present, and as each house was
destroyed, earth was heaped over it, leveled off, and a
new house begun. This process was not, however, carried on by the same cultural group throughout the sequence, for the lower and upper levels contain many
important differences in house type, burial method,
pottery and other artifact types. The two upper levels,
in fact, provide a type site for the Belcher Focus13 of

important recent excavations in that state. The material described has not been completely coordinated as
yet into culture complexes, and the papers are more
intriguing than satisfying. Some suggestions for focus
and aspect names have been made, but these are somewhat conflicting. Orr (1939) speaks of such a complex
as “non-historic house type I villages” near Spiro
Mound, and says that these “plainly belong to a late
phase of the Lower Mississippi pattern [sic].” No one
else has recognized such a “pattern.” Finkelstein (1940)
states that:

such relationships involves more than a few Red River
sites. Primarily we need to recognize the many distinct
complexes which have heretofore been lumped as
“Caddoan,” and to arrange these in proper spatial and
temporal perspective. The present paper adopts Orr’s
(1941) terms for the Spiro, Fort Coffee, and Glendora
Foci, but rejects his suggested “Ozan Focus” and
“Caddoan Aspect.” His proposed “Ozan Focus” for
Harrington’s Ozan, Washington, and Hot Springs material is unsatisfactory because these sites belong to
more than one complex and can now be included in the
Haley and Texarkana Foci. His suggestion of a
“Caddoan Aspect” is unacceptable, not only because
of the general undesirability of an ethnic term, but also
because the ground to be covered involves much more
than a grouping into one Aspect. My terms Gibson
Aspect and Fulton Aspect, with their various foci, can
be better understood after their content is outlined below.
In respect to relationships with such concepts as
the Mississippi Pattern, the Upper, Middle, and “Lower”
Mississippi Phases, etc., the picture west of the Mississippi is greatly confused at present. The reason is
twofold: lack of organization in the local material, and
lack of reliable definitions for the “Mississippian” complexes. The present paper attempts to remedy the first
condition. When compared to recognized Phases of
the Mississippi Pattern, the whole body of material
treated here does not find a suitable position in any of
these Phases. Mound building has a place, but a limited one. The pottery and house traditions are distinctive. Burial practices, projectile points, etc., involve
special problems. Perhaps all this could be summarily
placed in the Middle Mississippian Phase, but I see no
point in doing so merely for the sake of classification.
Tentatively, because of the special problems inherent
in the present material, involving relationships with different sections of the east, the Plains, and the Southwest, I am inclined to think that the Gibson and Fulton
Aspects define a separate phase of the Mississippian
Pattern which might be called the Red River Phase.
This point will not be pushed at present.

This external influence (on the Norman
site) undoubtedly came from 1 or more of
several culture centers in northeastern
Oklahoma which have presented a
common material culture complex: the
Reed site near (Locust?) Grove to the
north, the Hughes site near Muskogee to
the south, the Brackett site near
Tahlequah to the east and the Craig site
near Spiro, the largest and most widely
known, to the southeast. These
components, including the Norman
Component, are constituents of the Spiro
Aspect [sic], Lower Mississippi Phase.
The focus, or foci, have not yet been
determined.

Yet on the same page he states “It is evident
that the Spiro Focus [sic] complex is similar if not identical to the culture out of which developed the Red
River Caddo complex.” And again, “The Gahagan site
on Red River in Red River County [i.e., Parish], Louisiana, fits bodily into the Spiro Aspect [sic]. According
to James A. Ford the Gahagan site is early Caddoan
culturally.”
I have gone over many of the specimens and
discussed the problems with David A. Baerreis of the
University of Oklahoma. There is little doubt that a
situation exists which involves far-reaching inter-relationships from central Louisiana to northeastern Oklahoma, but the question of the nature and degree of

THE GIBSON AND FULTON ASPECTS

T

respects the Spiro, Haley, and Gahagan are rather
closely related and form a sort of north-south axis from
the Arkansas River system in northeastern Oklahoma
to the lower Red River in central Louisiana. Sanders
and Alto are most divergent, with the former decidedly
closer to Spiro than to the others, and the latter closest
to Gahagan. Many of the differences in content between the five foci appear to be traceable to geographic
position with attendant exposure to certain influences
from different directions. Other discrepancies may be
due to time factors suggested by comparisons with
outside cultures but not yet well understood, or supported by sufficient stratigraphic control, within the
Gibson Aspect area. For reasons to be given below,
Gahagan and Alto may possibly have existed at a somewhat earlier time than Sanders, Spiro, and Haley. The
problem of dating also revolves around the presence
or absence of what has been called the “Southern Cult”
(Ford and Willey 1941) as well as time factors.

he focus inventories are given below as they appear to the writer after examining the materials
and literature. Whatever the Pattern and Phase may
be, all the material used here belongs to a general Base
of agricultural economy with permanent or semi-permanent dwellings and settlements, pottery making, the
bow and arrow, dog, and domestic (?) turkey. Hunting
and fishing were practiced to supplement agriculture.
Probably the wooden mortar and pestle were used
throughout, but there is no direct evidence. An unshaped
stone slab with shallow oval basin, and either an unshaped or oval one-handed mano used with a rotary
motion seem to have been universal; it may be supposed that these served for seed grinding while corn
was ground in the eastern manner with wooden mortar and pestle. Other traits common to the Gibson and
Fulton Aspects are given below, but it must be emphasized that these are only general practices; more specific forms being found in the foci. For example, pottery pipes are universal, but forms differ in the foci. A
list of absences which may be significant in eastern
prehistory is included. Recognizable intrusions are
of course excluded from all the tables except where
specifically listed.
It is quite possible that some of the items in Tables
1 and 3 do not apply correctly to the Spiro Focus. I
have not attempted to use all the material found at Spiro
and related sites, but only that which has counterparts
in one or more of the Gibson Aspect foci (Table 2).
This certainly takes in the greater part of the Spiro
data and I feel confident that its affiliations place it in
this Aspect. However, because of its geographic position, the Spiro culture may also contain other features
gained through influences from northerly and easterly
directions. The clarification of these matters rests with
the Oklahoma archaeologists and they are not responsible for the way the information they offered is used
here.

The Southern Cult
This presumed ceremonial complex is based
archaeologically on the occurrence of certain repoussé
copper and conch shell objects, and polished monolithic axes, often of most impressive workmanship and
beauty, through a wide area extending from eastern
Oklahoma and Missouri possibly as far east as New
Jersey (Holmes 1883:284–285) and to the famous
Moundville and Etowah sites, in Alabama and Georgia
respectively. Most authorities claim that the Cult was
a short-lived but spectacular ceremonial phenomenon
which swept over the southeastern states after the time
of DeSoto, probably late in the sixteenth century.
Through much of the Southeast it can definitely be
placed within the shell-tempered pottery horizon of the
“Middle Mississippian” period or phase. Some of the
sites in which the Cult objects appear may have been
inhabited for some time before the ceremonial complex reached them. Several of the finest shell and copper objects which bear figures of priests or warriors in
masks, holding or wearing symbolic paraphernalia,
dancing and performing rites, etc., have been pictured
by Holmes (1883:Plates LI–LXXV), Phillips
(1940:Plates 30–32), and Lewis and Kneberg

THE GIBSON ASPECT
It will be apparent from Table 3 that few traits
are common to all foci of the Gibson Aspect. The five
foci, however, are bound together by a running continuity in the material from one to another. In certain

stone figures with negroid faces and
characteristic arrangement of hair in two
rolls on the top of the head.

(1941:Plate III). Ford and Willey (1941:357–358) have
summarized the Cult as follows:
During the Temple Mound II stage there
appears to have arisen a curious cult
which shows little relationship to
anything which has previously
transpired, and which spread rapidly over
the entire Mississippi Valley area,
although most common in the south. The
paraphernalia from which the presence of
this cult is deduced show a high degree
of similarity all over the area. Included
are such items as conch shell masks
marked with the winged or “weeping” eye
symbol; copper and shell pendants with

into the following: The Cross, The Scalloped Disk, The
Bird, The Spider, The Serpent, The Human Face
(“weeping eye” masks of later writers), and The Human Figure. These divisions prove to be convenient in
the present study and moreover appear to have some
areal significance; while all seven classes of gorgets
may belong together east of the Mississippi, they do
not all appear in the sites farthest to the west.
Of the five foci of the Gibson Aspect known at
present, only the Spiro and Sanders have definitely
yielded Cult specimens. Two or three gorgets in Haley
Focus sites do not establish the Cult satisfactorily there,
for the objects could represent trade. No trace is seen

As long ago as 1880 Holmes had carefully approached the problem of the possible Middle American origin of this material. He called attention to the
remarkable similarity between one of the “Mound
Builder” gorgets decorated with a looped square on
each side of which depicted a bird head with decidedly
angular features, and a specimen from Palenque
(Holmes 1883:270–271). Holmes (1883:Figure 5 and
Plate LIX) presents another looped square from the
Vienna Codex of the Aztecs; with its central cross this
figure is nearly identical to some of those on Southeastern gorgets, although it lacks the bird heads. For
purposes of description Holmes divided shell gorgets

None of these has been described in print except Coles Creek Incised (see text note 8). “Spiro Fine Engraved” and “Keota Curvilinear
Incised” have merely been suggested by me as names for the outstanding Spiro pottery, but have not as yet been used in Oklahoma.
A rough idea of some types can be gained from the following published works: Spiro Fine Engraved see Moore (1912:Figures 40–41,
44–45 and Plate XL); Harrington (1920, nearly all engraved vessels from Washington site). Keota Curvilinear Incised see Moore
(1912:Figures 124–125); Orr (1939:Figures 3a–b, e?); Harrington (1920:Plates XXVI–XXIX and LXV). Haley Complicated Incised
see Moore (1912:Figures 43, 51, 53, 57, 126–127 and Plate XXXIX). Holly Fine Engraved see Moore (1912:Figures 22–23); Webb
and Dodd (1939:Figure 1 and Plate 26-3). The Alto and Sanders Foci types are being described and illustrated in papers by Newell
and the writer.
2
Fragile pipes with stems up to 25 inches long and thin, delicate bowl. Examples in Moore (1912:Figure 39); Harrington (1920:Plates
CI–CII).
3
For examples see Webb and Dodd (1939:Plates 24–25); Moore (1911:Plate XXIX); Moore (1912:Figures 13–17, 34–36).
4
Two pottery pipes from T. M. Sanders site appear to be simulations of the Spiro T-shaped stone pipe.
5
The few bits of native copper found by Newell at Alto are of undetermined use.
6
Alexandria Sandstone, found in southwestern Louisiana and into Texas, represents trade where found outside its source area. Moore
(1912:Figure 20), shows a typical hone of this white, gritty material.
7
See Moore (1912:Figures 18–19, 21); Webb and Dodd (1939:Plate 27-1); Harrington (1920:Plates CX–CXI) for examples. Copena
specimens are commonly called projectile points; these appear more like knives or spear points.
8
For examples: Hayes Barbed, see Moore (1912:Figures 26, 28–29, 33); Harrington (1920:Plates CVI i–1, CVII a–f, h–1). Alba
Barbed, Webb and Dodd (1939:Plate 28-1, row 2 and right half of row 3). Gahagan Notched Triangular, Webb and Dodd (1939:Plate
28-1, row 1). The “2 Coles Creek Styles” are those in row 3–left–and row 4 of same plate. Orr (1941), uses “campanulated” for
points like my Hayes and Alba Barbed, “stemmed” for a style here called Bonham Barbed, and “notched triangular” for a similar to
but distinct from Gahagan Notched Triangular.
9
Sources for Spiro Focus are Orr (1939) for Spiro Mound village; Howard (1940) for Brackett site; Baerreis, correspondence. In
general, the two-center-post houses are rectangular with entranceway on one of the long sides, while the four-center-post houses are
square, but this is not always consistent.
10
I am not sure that the rectangular, two-post house with wall trenches at the Norman site (Finkelstein 1940) belongs to the Spiro
Focus, although most of the Norman material, including the four-post house, apparently does. Webb and Dodd (1940) found a square
house with wall trenches, central fire basin, scattered interior posts, and entranceway of parallel post rows directed northeast in
Belcher Level 4, i.e., below the Belcher Focus levels.

in either the Gahagan or Alto Focus. Shell artifacts are
totally absent from Alto and limited to beads and ear
spools at Gahagan. Copper objects of many interesting
forms have been recovered from Gahagan by Moore
(1912) and Webb and Dodd (1939), but these are distinctly non-Cult in nature, referring, that is, to the general Spiro-Dallas-Moundville-Etowah “Mexican-like”
cult. Gahagan copper work, on the other hand, is seen

in the form of circular and square ear ornaments in
repoussé, long-nosed human-face masks, human-hand
effigies of sheet copper, bear claw effigies, sheet tubes,
and covering of stone ear spools and small wooden
beads, all or some of which are comparable to
Hopewellian copper work (Webb and Dodd 1939:104–
107, 112–115 and Plates 28–29). The few bits of native copper recovered from the Alto Mound (Davis
16

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

site) are of unknown use, hence the status of Alto Focus copper work is uncertain, even as regards ear spool
covering.
The main Spiro Mound (Craig site) is famous
for its large numbers of conch shell gorgets, whole shells,
and copper plaques depicting a variety of spectacular
Cult figures, although unfortunately most of these specimens have become widely scattered in private hands
and various museums and few, if any, have been published. I am not sure whether all of Holmes’ seven
classes of shell gorgets are represented here, for I have
not seen examples of the Scalloped Disk with central
“involuted” lines, or the Human Face masks from Spiro
mound or other sites of the Focus. The eye-in-hand
symbol which appears so prominently in jar engravings
at Moundville and adjacent Mississippi (Phillips 1940:Figure 32) does not seem to have been well established, if
established at all, west of the Mississippi River.15 There
is a possibility that the so-called Southern Cult was not
one, but a series of closely related cults (Phillips
1940:366). The Moundville death-head symbols, along
with those of the hand, eye, and arm bones are not
only executed in a style somewhat distinct from the
disguised human dancing figures, demons, birds, etc.,
but they appear in somewhat different distributions from
the latter and are, moreover, more closely connected
with pottery decoration than shell and copper work.
Moundville apparently includes practically all of the Cult
elements, whatever the number of distinct complexes,
but westward in the Spiro Focus area some of these
drop out. Beautifully carved and polished stone effigy
pipes appear west of the Mississippi. Monolithic axes
may have been found at Spiro Mound16 but are otherwise absent from the Gibson Aspect area.
The T. M. Sanders site in Lamar County, Texas,
the main component of the Sanders Focus, has yielded
a number of graves in which some, but by no means all
of the Cultist shell gorgets occurred. Thus variations
of The Cross, The Bird (turkey), and The Human Figure are known there, but no examples of The Scalloped Disk, The Spider, The Serpent, or The Human
Face masks have been found. None of the Cultist copper repoussé work has appeared, the copper being limited to covering of stone ear spools and a possible connection with the haftment of bison scapula hoes which
bear green stains. Whole conch shells and dippers occur but are either plain or engraved with simple triangles. Stone or pottery effigy pipes and monolithic
axes have not been found. The Cult has thus far appeared only in this single locality in Texas, near the
south bank of the Red River, and in a considerably
attenuated form. However, from the cross-intrusion of

certain pottery types and a few traits held in common,
such as bison scapula hoes, stone elbow pipes, arrow
points of type Bonham Barbed, long-stemmed pottery
pipes, Copena blades, crowded multiple burials, and
possibly square houses, we can be rather certain that
the Sanders and Spiro Foci were coeval.
The Haley Focus, including units of the Mineral
Springs, Washington, and Ozan 1 “sites” (Harrington
1920), Haley (Moore 1912), part of Crenshaw (Moore
1912; Lemley 1936), and part of Hatchel (see section,
“Chronological Position of the Fulton Aspect,” below),
was also apparently contemporaneous with the Sanders and Spiro Foci. Plain and geometrically engraved
conch shells and dippers have been found in limited
numbers in the graves of these sites, but Cult objects,
except for two or three specimens of The Cross and
The Scalloped Disk, seem to be unknown. Copper is
confined to the covering of shell and wooden ear spools,
and sheet copper tubular beads. Stone and pottery effigy pipes are of rare occurrence. In spite of many
notable differences which center about burial method
and the absence of Cult material, the Haley Focus is
very similar to Spiro in pottery and projectile types, in
the possession of both multiple and single burials, longstemmed pottery pipes, Copena blades, quartz crystals, galena nodules, and intrusions of Coles Creek Plain
and Coles Creek Incised vessels and sherds from the
lower Mississippi region.
In respect to the presence or absence of conch
shell and copper work the five Gibson Aspect foci are
summarized in Table 4.
Beads
The Spiro, Sanders, Haley, and Gahagan Foci
sites have all yielded numerous barrel-shaped beads,
usually about one-half inch long, cut from the columella
of conch shells. Such beads also occur in the later Fulton
Aspect foci and seem to have a general distribution
quite apart from the larger conch objects such as dippers and gorgets. The same four foci have produced
fairly numerous examples of marginella beads, usually
ground on one side to provide a hole for stringing.
Pearl beads have been found in the Sanders,
Spiro, and Haley Foci graves, but not in Gahagan. Alto
is blank in this respect, as it is in all shell or bead work,
but no graves of this Focus have yet been discovered.
Pipes
Along the Spiro-Haley-Gahagan axis another
spectacular feature is seen in the occurrence of beau17

The wooden object carved like a parrot head and copper-covered, described by Harrington (1920:90 and Figure 32) from the
Mineral Springs site, Mound 2, came from a large multiple burial which is typically Haley Focus. Because of the general dearth
of repoussé copper in this region, the object seems to be an importation from the Spiro Focus.

tifully carved and polished stone effigy pipes. These
take the form of human beings in various crouching
and kneeling positions, frogs, and perhaps imaginary
animals or demons. The pipe bowl is commonly located in the head or back, the orifice for insertion of a
stem somewhere in the back or rear. Similar pipes
modeled in pottery appear in the same foci. Strikingly
similar pipes of various stones and pottery have been
found in the same general distribution area as the Cult
mentioned above; that is, eastward from the Red and
Arkansas valleys to Moundville and Etowah, but their
connection with the Cult is not clear. Their appearance
in the Gahagan and Haley sites indicates that they were
made or acquired by peoples somewhat outside the
Cult belt. Sanders and Alto are negative in respect to
effigy pipes, both these foci lying at the western ex-

tremes of the Gibson Aspect.
The very delicately molded pottery pipes with
thin stems up to 25 inches long and thin, fragile bowls
(see Harrington 1920:Plates 101–102) have been found
throughout the Gibson Aspect, although they become
notably shorter and thicker at Sanders. Some Sanders
pipes lack the protruding distal end and hence look more
like an elbow form, yet the stem and bowl are thin as in
the long-stemmed pipes.
Tumulus Building
The Spiro, Haley, and Alto Foci all include at
least one flat-topped, rectangular or square tumulus in
the better known sites. Spiro and Haley Focus sites
also include oval or conical burial tumuli along with the
18

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

rectangular. The Gahagan site consists of three or four
small conical tumuli but has none of a rectangular shape,
unless one or more of those still visible were once rectangular and subsequently washed and plowed down.
Presumably these shapes had some meaning in terms
of purpose, but there is not as yet enough careful excavation data to establish a connection. Rectangular
tumuli may have served primarily for temple foundations, but in this area definite posthole patterns have
not been found in their summits, and in several of these
tumuli there are graves. Graves are also found in conical tumuli and low rounded heaps. Several tumuli have
been found to be almost entirely barren and may have
been erected over large multiple burials which have
never been discovered because of failure to explore
the subsoil.
None of the Sanders Focus sites have yet revealed the presence of a definite tumulus, although
midden caps with burials over natural knolls have been
called “burial mounds.” As these sites lie along the
western frontier of the Gibson Aspect (see Figure 1), it
seems likely that tumulus building had never spread
this far west before it was abandoned altogether.

In size, these graves range up to 19 feet 6 inches
by 15 feet at Gahagan, 18 feet by 12 feet in the Haley
Focus complex at Crenshaw (8 feet 8 inches by 6 feet
in the Haley site itself), and 22 feet by 13 feet 6 inches
in the Crenshaw sub-tumulus “Pre-Caddo” graves. The
Washington and Mineral Springs sites and “Mound 2”
of Ozan site 1 (Harrington 1920) in southwestern Arkansas also included examples of the same grave type,
which is one of the reasons for including them in Haley
Focus rather than Spiro, where multiple burials are
crowded into small pits and the bodies flexed. It seems
likely that the Haley-Gahagan grave type represents
interments of important persons with their wives and/
or servants, a custom surviving among the historic
Natchez.
Farther north and west the Spiro and Sanders
Foci differ from Haley and Gahagan in that both single
and multiple disposals were crowded into as small
graves as would hold the bodies and the grave goods.
Spiro burials were exclusively flexed and semi-flexed,
the Sanders burials extended as in Haley-Gahagan; but
in both cases the goods were placed on and around the
bodies and heads, so that in a multiple burial it is difficult to separate the offerings belonging to the individuals. Pit-wall group offerings are entirely lacking in the
Spiro and Sanders Foci graves. Sanders graves contain up to eight individuals, but nearly half the interments are single.

Burial Methods
Regarding the burials, those of the Gahagan and
Haley Foci are the most spectacular, along with those
of the “Pre-Caddo” or “Coles Creek” graves found by
Lemley beneath the Crenshaw tumuli. These graves
are very large, rectangular in shape, and contain up to
fifteen individuals. The bodies were arranged in one
main row, extended and parallel, with all or most of
their heads oriented in the same direction. At right
angles to the main row, i.e., lengthwise in the grave,
another body was sometimes placed (Webb and Dodd
[1939] for Gahagan; Moore [1912] for Gahagan and
Haley; Lemley [1936] for Crenshaw). The placement
of grave goods is also significant, for the greater part
of these, including vessels, long-stemmed pottery pipes,
stone effigy pipes, ceremonial axes or “spuds,” arrow
points (often in bunches as though deposited in quivers), celts, quartz crystals, and galena nodules, etc.,
were placed around the walls and in the corners of
the grave pit. In the same graves such personal objects as ear spools, disk and barrel-shaped conch shell
beads, marginella and pearl beads, as well as additional
arrow points, long-stemmed pipes, and celts were placed
or left in place on the body where worn in life. In Haley
Focus sites occasional conch shell dippers appear in
the graves, while copper objects such as mentioned
above are found in Gahagan graves.

Bone Hoes
Sanders and Spiro are also linked by the presence of hoes made from bison scapulae and from sections cut from the horn base into the skull—a particularly tough section of bone. The scapula hoes from
Sanders (and Spiro?) have a deep hole about one inch
in diameter cut inward from the proximal end fossa,
doubtlessly to receive one branch of a forked stick.
The hoes cut from horn and skull are scored around
the end for haftment. Aside from the end hole, the Sanders scapula hoes indicate a common Plains agricultural
implement. Thus the Sanders and Spiro Foci, facing
the southern Plains as well as the eastern woodlands,
possess a definitely Plains hoe which has not been
found in other “Caddo area” foci, unless it continues in
later foci in the Spiro area.
Pottery
In the field of pottery the Spiro, Haley, Gahagan,
and Alto Foci are all closely related, with Sanders divergent. All have in common the engraving technique
19

Alex D. Krieger

of decorating polished vessels, impression of red, white,
or rarely green pigment in these lines, and the use of
clay-lump temper plus the variable use of sand temper,
although the latter cannot certainly be said to be a purposeful aplastic in all cases. All Gibson Aspect foci
completely lack shell temper, and there are no, or very
few, vessels with no tempering. Bone was used in a
small percentage of vessels of several types in the Alto
Focus, and probably the Spiro, while in the Sanders
Focus, it is fairly well represented (up to 10 percent of
the vessels) in Sanders Plain, Sanders Engraved, and
Canton Incised. Alto Focus pottery, like Coles Creek,
rather commonly contains abundant small carbon lumps
mixed with clay grit as temper.
Maxey Noded Redware of Sanders Focus consists of red-filmed bottles with vertical rows of nodal
applications on the body; in this case the vessels are
predominantly sand tempered with some clay grit
added. Red film, applied both before and after firing, is
found on about 20 percent of the Sanders Plain and
Sanders Engraved vessels, as well as on all those of
Maxey Noded Redware. The decoration of Sanders
Engraved is notable for its simplicity, consisting only of
hachuring or hatched and cross-hatched triangles in a
single band around the vessel rim or mouth; this simplicity contrasts strongly with the beautiful curvilinear
motifs in engraving of the other foci. Again, Sanders
vessels have flat, disk bases and totally lack square
and convex bottoms, as well as base, body, and rim
quadration—features which occur to some extent in
Spiro, Haley, and Alto.
Engraved pottery exclusive of Sanders Focus
divides quite readily into two parts: Spiro and Haley
Foci on the one hand, and Gahagan and Alto on the
other. In the first two a type occurs which is here called
“Spiro Fine Engraved” (subject to approval in Oklahoma). This consists of some beautifully executed and
gracefully arranged scrolls on bottle and bowl forms. I
have checked this type for both Spiro and Haley Foci
in Table 3, but there are minor distinctions in shape and
design elements which may warrant a separate type
for Haley Focus. Along with these in the Spiro and
Haley Foci occurs another type here called “Keota
Curvilinear Incised,” in which scroll designs are incised
on bowls with convex bottoms and straight vertical sides,
commonly called “cazuela” bowls. It is important that
in these two foci scroll motifs are seen in both an engraved and incised type, though the patterns differ.
The Gahagan and Alto Foci are featured by the
type Holly Fine Engraved, which is characterized by
extremely fine lines expertly executed and arranged in
closely spaced concentric circles, semi-circles, quar-

ter-circles and straight parallel lines in panels and diagonal blocks, often all on the same vessel. Commonly
the core of the circles or segments is an excised pit, or
the innermost corner of a set of diagonals is an excised
triangle. These designs are notably more compact than
those of “Spiro Fine Engraved” and the total effect is
quite striking (see Table 3, note 1 for references to
published illustrations). In these two foci engraved designs do not include scroll motifs. Scrolls do occur in
the Alto Focus, however, in the type Crockett Curvilinear Incised. In this type the designs are practically identical to those of “Keota Curvilinear Incised” but the
range of vessel shapes is distinct from the latter, although some “cazuela” bowls with vertical rims and
convex bottom are included.
In all four foci—Spiro, Haley, Gahagan, and
Alto—bottles are commonly of a distinctive shape, with
a somewhat compressed globular body and a long, tapered spout. This spout, usually bearing several horizontal lines just below the lip, is in strong distinction to
the straight or flaring spout without lines found in the
bottles of all Fulton Aspect foci. In all four of the Gibson
Aspect foci this bottle occurs with simple parallel lines
around both the mouth and the shoulder and has been
given the name Hickory Fine Engraved by Newell at
the Davis site. In the Spiro and Haley Foci it may represent simply bottles of “Spiro Fine Engraved” that lack
the usual body decoration, and the same may be true in
the Gahagan and Alto Foci. At Alto, however, some
carinated bowls bear the same simple parallel lines
around the rim, and it seems feasible to establish a
separate type Hickory Fine Engraved. Thus the three
types “Spiro Fine Engraved,” Holly Fine Engraved, and
Hickory Fine Engraved establish a close ceramic relationship between the Gibson Aspect foci exclusive of
Sanders Focus.
This relationship is supported by the close similarity of “Keota” and Crockett Curvilinear Incised. In
both types the scroll pattern includes a circle filled with
punctates—either straight in, wedge-shaped with the
corner of a cube, or circular as though done with a
reed. A connecting line runs from the bottom of one
circle to the top of the next and is flanked by triangular
areas also filled with various punctates or hatching.
On smaller vessels the scroll is usually repeated four
times, but this number may increase to 20 or more on
the large carinated bowls at Alto. The design pattern in
both types is undoubtedly similar to that of French Fork
Incised in the Coles Creek period of Louisiana, except
that neither has the characteristic reed punctate or
excised triangle in or at the end of the scroll bisector. A
relationship with French Fork is obvious, but it is prob20

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

lematical whether they were areal relatives or French
Fork Incised was “ancestral” to Crockett and “Keota.”
Several other incised, finger-gouged, and
punctated types are found in one or another of the
Gibson Aspect Foci but cannot be discussed here, except to say that in the Alto Focus there are certain
ones which compare closely with Louisiana types.
Body and rim quadration are known but uncommon in the Spiro, Haley, and Alto Foci, and absent in
the Sanders and Gahagan material. In the Spiro, Haley,
and Alto Foci vessel bottoms are flat and square, flat
and round, or convex, with varying frequency in different types. Where found, these treatments may be due
to some influence from Marksville types or French Fork
Incised, which are sometimes square-bottomed or fourlobed or both. Too little is known of Gahagan pottery
for definite statements, but in general it consists of Alto
and Coles Creek types.
The few effigy vessels in the Gibson Aspect are
mainly from Haley Focus sites, principally those excavated by Harrington at Washington and Mineral Springs
(Harrington 1920:Plates 93–94 and 98–100), with possibly a few from Spiro Focus sites as well. Where legs
appear they belong to full effigies or quadrupeds
(Harrington 1920:Plates 99–100). No tripod or stirrupspout vessels are known in this Aspect. Strap handles
appear infrequently on some Haley Complicated Incised jars, rarely on bowls; evidently the handles are
always two in number, opposed, and attached to the
vessel lip at the upper end. It may be said that zoomorphic effigies, leg, wing, or fin appendages, and handles
seem to be confined to the two northern foci of this
Aspect and period. Possibly they are most common in
Haley Focus sites and Spiro Focus specimens were
acquired by trade. The Haley sites in southwest Arkansas lie closest to the “Middle Mississippi” central
basin area of well developed effigy pottery, and these
features may reflect influence from that direction.
No human effigies, either in the form of “head
vessels” or bowl-rim appendages, appear in Gibson
Aspect pottery, although they do, of course, appear on
“Cult” artifacts, effigy pipes, and small stone heads or
rude pottery figurines. One painted vessel, probably
intrusive from the Mississippi valley region to the east,
has been found in a Haley Focus grave (Moore
1912:Plate XXXVII). All other true painting is likewise
intrusive.
The notes given here are merely suggestive and
of broad comparative interest in the present problem.
Before all the relationships and influences can be fully
understood the entire ceramic complex of each focus
must be published in detail.

Miscellaneous Objects
“Spuds” or spatulate celts occur in all except
Alto Focus, which is odd since they are common at
Gahagan.
Quartz crystals have appeared in all foci except
Sanders, in graves and loose in the midden. Hones or
awl sharpeners of a distinctive gritty white material
native to southwestern Louisiana (Alexandria Sandstone) have likewise appeared in all the foci except
Sanders. As in several other respects, the Sanders
Focus must have been too far west or too short-lived
to have received some of the traits established from
Spiro to Gahagan and Alto.
A particularly notable trait is the occurrence of
the “Copena point” or blade, a well-made knife or projectile from 2½ inches to 7 inches in length, with gracefully recurved edges and either straight or concave base.
This object, a characteristic trait of certain Southeastern cultures, has appeared in every focus except possibly Sanders, where one or two blades may or may
not belong to this type. Similar blades have been found
as far west as central Texas in non-pottery sites of the
Edwards Plateau, undoubtedly as trade objects.
More exact studies should be made of ear spools
in this entire area. Probably significant styles made in
stone, wood, shell, bone, pottery, and copper would reveal definite distributions. One form or another has been
found in each Gibson Aspect focus: stone, shell, bone,
and copper at Gahagan; stone only at Alto and Sanders; stone, shell, and wood in Spiro and Haley, etc.
Respecting the large stone “pulley-shaped” specimens
with carved faces from Spiro, Gahagan, and Alto sites,
one may note that many of these have central perforations which show smoothing within the bore. It seems
possible that such perforated stone “ear spools” were
really spindle whorls, although perhaps their position in
burials and the presence of copper sheeting on some
of them destroys this interpretation. From Haley and
Alto sites there are also some flanged pottery rings too
small for bracelets which may be another form of ear
spool (Harrington 1920:Figure 26).
The ubiquitous perforated disks cut from potsherds, and mussel shells with central perforation, could
also have possibly served as spindle whorls, the perforations being of about the right size (½–¾ inches in
diameter) and often polished inside.
Houses
House patterns reveal some interesting facts,
although there is data from very few localities. There
21

Alex D. Krieger

is no information from Gahagan, and almost none from
the Haley and Sanders Foci. Main reliance is on the
Davis site (Alto mound and village) series of 32 structures, and on several houses and house types described
by Oklahoma archaeologists (see Table 3, notes 9 and
10). It is impossible to distinguish between dwellings
and ceremonial buildings in light of most available data,
hence they are termed collectively “houses” herein.
At least one complicated and doubtlessly ceremonial
building was discovered by Newell (n.d.) at the Davis
site and, with the others, is described in his report.
The Spiro Focus house pattern includes both
square and rectangular plan with either two or four
large interior “center posts,” a prepared clay fire basin
in the center, and an extended entranceway of either
parallel trenches or post rows (Figure 2). In general, it
appears that the two-center-post principle was used
with a rectangular plan, and four center posts in a square
plan, but this is not entirely consistent. The prepared
(clay-lined) central fire basin is perhaps not always
present, and the entranceway may consist of both post
rows and trenches, the posts being sunk in the trenches.
In spite of variations, the central plan is quite definite
and evidently similar to that found in the Upper Republican and Nebraskan cultures (Wedel 1940), as well as
that of the Mouse Creeks and possibly the Dallas Foci
in eastern Tennessee (Lewis and Kneberg 1941). The
Spiro, Nebraskan, and Mouse Creeks house floors
were evidently sunk a foot or so below ground level.
Of Sanders houses we know very little other than
that the field notes on the T. M. Sanders site mention
more or less square plans with post holes along three
sides, “one whole side being left open as a door.” In
studying the excavation notes I suspect that parts of
these houses were trenched away before they were
recognized, but further information is needed to check
this. If the houses were typically square they agree
more with the Spiro type than with the other Gibson
Aspect foci, which is not surprising in view of several
other considerations.
The meager data indicate that Haley Focus
houses contrast with those of Spiro Focus in being circular, very large (diameter up to 50 feet) and without
extended entranceways or center posts. Scattered interior posts acted as braces where needed. Prepared
central fire basins may have been present in some
cases. One large house probably referable to Haley
Focus was cleared by Beatty under the Hatchel Mound
near Texarkana (see “Chronological Position of the
Fulton Aspect,” below). Harrington’s notes on structures at the Washington, Mineral Springs, and Ozan 1
sites are ambiguous, first because of the scant infor-

mation, and second because of the mixed nature of his
“sites,” but possibly both round and square houses were
made in this area. He gives practically no information
on center posts, fireplaces, or entrances, and their presence or absence cannot be inferred.17
Houses at the Davis site include two principal
ground plans: a large circle 18 feet to 50 feet in diameter, and a square with rounded corners, 24 to 34 feet
across. The former is very much like the large Haley
(?) Focus house at Hatchel Mound, having no interior
center posts 18 but a few braces, and no definite
entranceway; in both cases entrances could have been
gained through any of the several gaps noticeable between groups of posts along the perimeter. The Davis
squarish house (see Figure 2) also has gaps any one or
more of which could have served as entrances. Though
perhaps not impossible it seems quite unlikely that any
of these structures could have had roof entrances. In
the Davis site series a carefully made clay-lined fire
basin was present in the center of a few houses, including both the circular and square-with-rounded corners. Several of these houses also had large oval cache
pits in their floors (Newell n.d.).
At the Belcher site in northwestern Louisiana, a
house in the fourth level, i.e., below the two Belcher
Focus levels, was rectangular (almost square) with
rounded corners, a prepared clay fire basin in the center, and scattered interior posts or braces. In these respects it agrees with some of the Alto houses in a general way, but it also had an extended entranceway of
post rows, and its wall posts were set in trenches. A
clay wall one foot high ran in front of the house on both
sides of the entranceway (Webb and Dodd 1939:Plate
11). In date it may well lie within the Gibson Aspect.
These notes merely serve to indicate that the
problem of dwellings in the “Caddo area,” like the other
archaeological manifestations, is far from simple; there
is regional differentiation and various structural elements have been invented or borrowed from different
sources and employed in various combinations. A great
deal more information is needed from within the area
and a detailed comparison with other Plains, Mississippian, and Southeastern structures must be made before house histories are understood.
Projectile Points
Turning to projectile points we find that small,
thin, light, finely chipped points, undoubtedly for arrows,
occur in all foci. As these have often been found in
graves (except in Alto Focus) their association with
the focal aggregates is definite. Larger, heavier dart

points are found in many of the same sites with varying frequency, but in the largest pottery sites dart points
are usually so uncommon that they must be either intrusive by trade or perhaps were left during sporadic
occupations by foreign peoples. At any rate, they seldom occur in graves or in other definite associations.
In Spiro Focus there are a few dart intrusions; in Sanders, Haley, and Gahagan apparently none whatever.
Three dart types have been found in some numbers in
the Alto mound and village; two others are intrusive
from non-pottery Edwards Plateau cultures of central
Texas. In Sanders Focus only a single arrow point type,
Bonham Barbed, has been found as an integral part of
the Focus; this type occurs along with others in Spiro
Focus sites (Figure 3).
It will be noted in Table 3 and Figure 3 that a
strong similarity runs through the arrow points from
the five foci, Hayes Barbed, Alba Barbed, and Bonham
Barbed showing a basically similar principle of construction locally modified in proportion, shape of stem,
and elaboration of the blade edges. Bonham Barbed
rather definitely belongs to the Sanders and Spiro Foci
and is longer and narrower than the others, with a small
bulbous stem. Alba Barbed has fairly broad blades with
recurved edges, the barbs sweeping out laterally, then
curving back toward the stem, which is characteristically parallel-edged to fan-shaped. This type has a
rather wide distribution throughout the Aspect, except
for Sanders Focus. Hayes Barbed is much like Alba in
the blade, except that this often bears incuts near the
tip, narrowing the tip to drill-like proportions, and the
stem is characteristically lozenge in shape with peculiar tiny chipped protrusions on its corners and edges.
The beautiful Crenshaw and Haley site points (Moore
1912:Figures 26, 28, 29, and 33) belong to this type.
Two triangular types appear, both with slightly convex
edges and corner notches. That characteristic of Spiro
is a beautifully chipped form with straight base and
one or more pairs of side notches. The other, found so
far only at Gahagan, differs from the former in being
slightly longer and sharper, base concave, and has only
one pair of notches. Other forms have been found in
Spiro and Gahagan Foci sites but whether they are
characteristic or intrusive is not clear (see Figure 3).

between them which have yet to be discovered. Assuming for the present that they were coeval, they can
be relatively dated through their relationship to the
“Southern Cult,” which affected the two northerly foci:
Spiro and Sanders. According to most authorities who
have studied the position of the Cult in relation to eastern archaeological horizons, this ceremonial phenomenon spread rapidly over parts of the Southeast and
the Ohio valley in post-DeSoto times, perhaps late in
the sixteenth century.19 Haley Focus is ceramically
close to the Spiro Focus but features the Gahagan burial
complex. At the same time it lacks the Gahagan copper complex, as well as the Spiro shell and copper “Cult”
complex; i.e., the Haley Focus occupied a middle ground
between the Spiro and Gahagan cultures and was
hardly affected, if at all, by the ceremonial aspects of
either. Possibly this reflects a slight time differential
and Haley was a little too early or too late to have
participated. One Haley grave contained a painted bottle
(Moore 1912:Plate XXXVII), obviously an intrusion
from the “Middle Mississippi” area or culture, where it
would probably have existed within the shell temper
horizon. As the entire Gibson Aspect was without shell
temper, this intrusive specimen indicates that the Gibson
non-shell and “Middle Mississippi” shell temper horizons were roughly contemporaneous, but the shell temper idea had not yet spread as far west as the Gibson
Aspect cultures.
Turning to the Gahagan Focus, we may note especially the use of great rectangular grave pits with
burials up to seven in number placed in one main row,
extended and parallel, with occasionally one or more
laid at right angles to the main row; offerings in rather
large amounts placed around the bodies or left in place
where worn; a notable paucity of ceramic offerings;
placement of these graves in small conical tumuli; the
nature of the copper objects, including human face
masks and hand effigies, which are distinct from the
ornate repoussé “Cult” objects of Spiro; marginella
beads; shell and stone ear spools (covered with copper); and solid copper ear ornaments in repoussé, both
round and square; and the total lack of conch shell
gorgets and dippers.
This assemblage strikingly suggests Hopewellian
affiliations, as Webb and Dodd (1939:112–115) have
already noted. Thus, while the very paucity of ceramic
remains in the Gahagan graves, together with the burial
disposition and the associated traits, is non-Mississippian and probably Hopewellian or akin thereto, the few
vessels which have been found in these graves are
engraved and incised, clay-tempered, and of bottle and
bowl shapes, obviously of a Mississippian tradition. Yet

CHRONOLOGICAL POSITION OF
THE GIBSON ASPECT
So far as present information goes, the five foci
of the Gibson Aspect were approximately contemporaneous. At the same time, it might be well to expect
that there may have been some temporal distinctions
24

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

25

Alex D. Krieger

the history of Mississippian pottery in the lower Mississippi valley region is itself complex. There was no
sudden intrusion of this ceramic tradition, for its Gibson
Aspect manifestations can be traced back—except for
the engraving technique—into the Coles Creek and Fort
Walton periods, and these in turn back into Troyville,
Marksville, and Weeden Island (Figure 4).
The Hopewellian survivals in the Gibson Aspect
are discussed in greater detail below in the section on
“Relationships with the Eastern United States.”
Intrusions of Coles Creek pottery appear in Haley,
Spiro, and Alto Focus sites. Rectangular flat-topped
tumuli, and multiple extended burials in rectangular
graves in oval tumuli are also found in the Coles Creek
culture, as in the “Pre-Caddo” at Crenshaw (Lemley
1936), and some Gibson Aspect sites. Several Gibson
Aspect incised pottery types seem to be simplified relatives of Coles Creek incised types, as, for example, the
Alto Focus types Hardy and Davis Incised compared
to Coles Creek Incised, and Crockett and “Keota”
Curvilinear Incised compared to French Fork Incised.
The Gibson engraved types, however, have no counterparts in Coles Creek or earlier cultures, at least in
decorative technique, although some of their motifs may
be simulations of those on earlier types. Alto Focus
and Coles Creek pottery furthermore hold in common
the use of both clay grit and carbon particles as tempering in the same vessels. Hence it is evident that the
Gibson Aspect as a whole probably represents a general phase of culture which was taking shape in the
Red River and adjacent valleys, partially derived from
the Coles Creek culture before the latter had completely died out.
The Alto Focus is based primarily upon the material excavated from the Davis site in east-central
Texas (see note 14). Newell’s (n.d.) publication treats
this interesting site in detail, together with the early
Spanish and French contacts in this region. The site
yielded a large village, and flat-topped primary and secondary tumuli which formed a peculiar L-shape, possibly the result of joining two large tumuli at an angle
(the structure was not completely excavated).
At one point on the Brazos River far to the west,
Frank H. Watt of Waco, Texas, investigated the Chupek
site (see Figure 1), and found several Alto Focus pottery types. There is no indication of a tumulus here, but
as in the Sanders Focus to the north, tumulus building
evidently fell short of the farthest western spread of
the Gibson Aspect culture phase. Eastward, a number
of sites in the Red River valley between Gahagan and
the Haley Focus sites have been investigated by Dr.
Clarence H. Webb of Shreveport and found to belong

primarily to the Alto Focus. Among these are Smithport
Landing, East Smithport, Wilkinson, Chamarre Lake,
and possibly Allen, Swanson’s Landing, etc. As far east
as western Mississippi, at least one site, Pocahontas
(Ford 1936:123–128) includes a tumulus with pottery
which compares closely with some Alto Focus types,
although the village part of this site bears very different pottery and is said to belong to the Tunica complex.
Thus the sites which appear to the writer as possible
components of the Alto Focus are spread over a great
deal more territory than either the Gahagan or Haley
Focus. Much of the material included in the “Caddo
complex” by Ford (1936) belongs to Alto Focus, and
some to the Bossier Focus of the Fulton Aspect.
Taking the Davis site as a base for the Alto Focus, its position in respect to surrounding sites is clear.
The assemblage of Davis site traits is distinct in nearly
every respect from that found in many other sites in
the Neches, Angelina, and upper Sabine valleys. The
latter nearly all belong to what we call the Frankston
Focus, almost beyond a doubt representing protohistoric
and historic groups of the Hasinai Confederacy of
Caddoan-speaking tribes. The Alto Focus, to judge by
the Neches valley sites, unquestionably existed before
this identifiably Caddoan Frankston Focus came into
existence (see “Fulton Aspect”). Whether the peoples
of the Gibson Aspect as a whole were Caddoan speakers is a question discussed in a later section (see “Ethnological Identities”).
The LaSalle party, in attempting to reach the
Mississippi overland from Matagorda Bay on the Texas
coast, visited the Cenis tribes (equivalent of the Spanish Asinai or Hasinai) in 1686. From all information
these peoples were encountered in the middle Neches
valley and around the modern town of Nacogdoches,
Texas. The French noted that the Cenis already possessed some Spanish trade objects which had probably been carried in from the long-established settlements in far western Texas or New Mexico. The Spanish occupation of eastern Texas began with the establishment of the mission San Francisco de los Tejas in
1690, supposedly on or near the Neches River a short
distance above the Davis site, although the exact location has never been satisfactorily determined.
As the Cenis were well established in the
Neches region by the time of LaSalle (at least there is
no evidence that they were new to the region), the
Frankston Focus must date back at least to 1650. As
this allows for only one or two generations before
LaSalle it seems reasonable that 1600 or so would be a
fairer date. As early as 1542 the DeSoto expedition
may have reached the Trinity River (Swanton 1932:63
26

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

Figure 4. Tentative alignment of agricultural and pottery cultures from New Mexico to the Mississippi
River.

Alex D. Krieger

and Figure 3, 1942:32); if so, it would have passed the
head of the Neches, but the lack of objects which might
be traced to this expedition restricts its dating possibilities for the archaeologist.
Here we encounter the question of whether the
DeSoto expedition contacted Caddoan-speaking tribes,
or their predecessors. Swanton (1942:29–32), through
the place names recorded by DeSoto and Moscoso,
believes that some of the peoples found by them in the
Red River valley were Caddoans. As mentioned above,
however, the presence of the Southern Cult presumably carries the whole Aspect into a post-DeSoto time,
perhaps the late 16th century. The Alto and Gahagan
Foci did not necessarily exist at exactly the same time
as Spiro, Haley, and Sanders, but all indications are
that they did, within a span of a few years. Thus it may
be that about the time of DeSoto a few groups of
Caddoan speakers were coming into the middle Red
River region, and the transition from Coles Creek to
Gibson Aspect culture was taking place either among
them or among other peoples.
At the Davis site a number of pottery types characteristic of earlier periods are represented by a few
sherds. Thus, there are about a dozen sherds which
appear to be Marksville Incised, seven either Marksville
or Troyville Stamped, and about 400 sand-tempered
sherds which more closely resemble Alexander Incised
and O’Neal Plain of the Tennessee-northern Alabama
area than any other known types.20 Nearly all the latter
400 sherds belong to about five or six vessels which
lay in and on the secondary tumulus of the Davis site.
We may also recall the total absence of shell and bone
artifacts from this site, and the near-total absence of
copper.
Griffin (personal communication) has suggested
that these Marksville and/or Troyville sherds may date
the Davis site, which would also agree in date with the
sand-tempered types farther east. According to Ford
and Willey (1941:Figure 6), this date would be about
1000 to 1200 A.D. for Marksville and 1200 to 1400
A.D. for Troyville. In this event, one might consider
that the late Coles Creek and subsequent Plaquemine
period pottery, which most closely resembles the Alto
series, developed out of the Alto Focus. Certainly this
possibility must be kept in mind.
On the other hand, the engraving technique of
decoration on a well polished surface was very well
developed in the Alto Focus in the types Holly Fine
Engraved and Hickory Fine Engraved. If it were shown
that the Alto and Gahagan cultures were notably older
than Spiro and Haley, then it would follow that the engraving principle was established in northwestern Loui-

siana and east Texas at a time when the stamped decorations of Marksville and Troyville were flourishing in
the lower Mississippi valley and the sand-tempered
Alexander series predominated in the WheelerPickwick basins.
Upon considering the various circumstances, it
seems reasonable at present to interpret the five Gibson
Aspect foci as approximately coeval, and the Gibson
Aspect as a whole coeval with a late Coles Creek period. This does not preclude the possibility that the Alto
and Gahagan Foci will at some point prove to have
been of somewhat earlier date than the rest of the
Gibson foci, and that engraving here existed as early
as rocker stamping farther east.
THE FULTON ASPECT
The Fulton Aspect is composed of at least seven
foci and represents a cultural horizon extending from
late prehistoric into historic times throughout the “Caddo
area” as it is generally conceived, and extending somewhat beyond this area to the east and southeast after
historic contacts began.
This Aspect with its regional foci in all probability represents a number of more or less distinct groups
of Southern Caddoans. Five of the seven foci now recognized are entirely without evidence of Caucasian contact but nevertheless give every indication of belonging to a short period just preceding the historic. One
focus, the Frankston, can be connected with the
Caddoan tribes of the Neches and neighboring valleys,
and extended from a pre-contact time into post-contact with only slight changes in pottery styles after contacts began. Another, the Glendora, in general represents Caddoan speaking groups living within the
protohistoric-historic period over a considerable area;
this area contains several prehistoric foci, in two of
which (Belcher and Titus) the Glendora may be said to
have had its roots. As not all Glendora sites have revealed Caucasian objects, we may suppose that the
early French and Spanish contacts reached some of
the villages a few years before the others. That is, if
contacts began at about 1686 in the Neches area with
the LaSalle party, and about 1714 in central Louisiana
with the founding of the French fort of Natchitoches,
we have a period of some 25 to 30 years within which
all the Glendora Focus sites could have been inhabited
whether or not they all yield Caucasian trade material.
Some may even have existed for some years after 1714,
especially in the middle Red River valley, and still not
have gained trade objects.
There is a strong horizontal relationship between
28

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

the seven Fulton Aspect foci which sets this culture
horizon off quite definitely from the preceding Gibson
Aspect horizon, within which there was likewise a
strong horizontal relationship. The principal differences
between the two Aspects lie in a number of non-ceramic traits characteristic of the Gibson Aspect which
disappear completely or are greatly attenuated in the
Fulton.
Those which disappeared are21: engraved conch
shell gorgets and dippers, and repoussé copper plaques
of the Southern Cult; stone and pottery effigy pipes;
long-stemmed pottery pipes; stone elbow and T-shaped
pipes; spatulate celts (“spuds”); use of quartz crystals
and galena; burial mounds of conical shape; large rectangular graves with multiple burials in rows and offerings placed along the walls (Gahagan and Haley type
graves); Copena blades with recurved edges; arrow
points with a variety of expanding, fan-shaped, and lozenge stems (Bonham Barbed, Hayes Barbed, Alba
Barbed, etc.); side-notched triangular arrow points;
hones of white Alexandria Sandstone; stone and pottery ear spools; practically all use of copper; marginella
beads; stone spindle whorls (?); and perhaps other traits
of lesser significance. All modeled, carved, and engraved depictions of the human head or body also disappear with Gibson Aspect.
Traits which evidently did not disappear from the
scene but which occur only very sporadically in Fulton
Aspect are: tumulus buildings of any kind; plain conch
shell dippers; shell ear spools; pearl beads; multiple burials (bunched closely together in small graves rather
than spaced in rows); socketed antler-tip projectiles;
and perhaps other traits. Practically all these “survivals” from the Gibson Aspect have been found in three
sites belonging to two foci: Belcher and Foster sites of
the Belcher Focus, and the Clement site of McCurtain
Focus. These sites are just above and below the southward bend of Red River.
A number of traits enter with the Fulton Aspect
in general which were unknown in the Gibson: short
elbow pipes of pottery; hones of brown sandstone; snubnosed scrapers; plain triangular and pointed-stem arrow points; pottery and bone labrets; location of some
sites on low hills or bluffs bordering larger valleys or
small streams and lakes; single burials with pottery
vessels around head or along body; graves made in
fairly large level-ground cemeteries in or near villages,
or dug into surfaces of tumuli left by previous peoples;
probably knobbed pins made from conch columella;
pendants of same material carved into effigies of insects, lizards, etc.
Through both Aspects a wide variety of shell

beads continued to be used in about the same forms;
these include simple mussel shells with a hole at the
edge; small disk beads cut from mussels and conch
and perhaps other shells; barrel-shaped beads about
one-half inch long and cylindrical beads from one to
three inches long, both cut from conch columella. Celts,
seed-grinding slabs, one-hand oval manos used with
rotary motion, perforated pottery disks and mussel shells,
and other items were also common to the two Aspects
(see Table 1). Extended burial position continued from
most Gibson foci into the corresponding Fulton, except
in the north where the Spiro flexed position continued
into McCurtain and “Fort Coffee.”
Table 5 lists the principal components of Fulton
Aspect foci known to date. Table 6 is a checklist for
traits and pottery types which characterize five of these
foci. Again, a general lack of trustworthy notes on specific associations at each site make the tabulation uncertain in some respects, and it should be regarded as
suggestive rather than conclusive. Two Foci have not
been entered into it, while a third which is called Fort
Coffee in Oklahoma might also be added to the Fulton
Aspect, but there is little information available on it. Of
the other two, Bossier and McCurtain, enough is known
to place them within this Aspect.
The Bossier Focus results from discussions between C. H. Webb and the writer, Webb having investigated and excavated a number of sites in Louisiana,
while I have gone over surface material collected on
about 150 sites in central East Texas by the WPAUniversity of Texas State-wide Archaeological Survey in 1939–40. As this is written, Webb has offered a
tentative list of Bossier Focus traits.22 The key sites in
this Focus are the Keatchie, Pease, and Jim Sinner
places in northwest Louisiana. Other sites are frequent
from the Angelina River region in east Texas to a point
perhaps 60 miles east of Shreveport. They thus cover
much the same territory as the preceding Alto Focus,
though not extending so far west (and east?). Sites of
this Focus are located on hillsides as well as valley
bottom, are nowhere connected with tumuli, and contain engraved and incised-brushed pottery types which
are for the most part readily distinguished from those
of other foci. The ceramic analysis of this complex is
still under discussion by Webb and the writer, and the
more exact definition of pottery type inclusiveness is
hampered by the fact that most of the material is from
surface collections where it is almost always mixed
with other complexes such as Coles Creek and Alto
Focus. Much of what Ford (1936) called the “Caddoan
complex” belonged to the Alto and Bossier Foci, representing two time periods.

As described by Webb and Dodd (1941), the type site of this focus at Belcher, LA, consists of an eminence built up by covering a
destroyed house with earth, then constructing a new house on the fill, and so on through four house levels. Whether each fill can be
regarded as a platform tumulus is open to question, but the presence of conch shell dippers, pearl beads, copper-covered ear spools,
and occasional multiple burials in this or other sites of the Focus indicates that part of the content of the preceding Haley Focus was
carried over locally into Belcher Focus times; tumulus building could have been a part of this carryover.
2
Variations in this disposal include occasional occurrence of two skeletons, such as adult and infant or two adults; dorsal position
usual, but other positions occur; orientation has been found consistent in individual cemeteries, but no direction is consistent for the
components of any one focus.
3
Description of all types except those of Belcher Focus are in preparation by the writer. By agreement with C. H. Webb his type
“Belcher Engraved” (Webb and Dodd 1941) has been divided into Belcher Engraved (Webb and Dodd 1941: Plates 15-1, 15-7, 161, 16-4 and 16-10) and TaylorEngraved (Webb and Dodd 1941: Plates 15-2 to 15-4 and 16-9). Webb has recently renamed his
“Belcher Stamped” Cowhide Stamped (after Cowhide Bayou) because it appears not to be a resident type in this focus, but closely
related to what may be called “Menard Punctate Banded,” a type probably connected with Glendora Focus. For a general idea of
Natchitoches Engraved, see Moore (1909:Plates I–V, VII and Figures 13, 16–17, 20–21, 27–54, 71, 73, 82, 131–132, 134, 139, 142,
144, 150); for Keno Trailed, see Moore (1909:Figures 9–11, 14–15, 18–19, 22–26, 55, 80 [?], 81, 86–87, 129–130, 137, 141).
4
Among other things, Belcher Engraved is distinguished by the presence of four very small peaks on the lip of bowl forms, and on
the sharp shoulder of compound bowls (Webb and Dodd 1941:Plates 15-1 and 16-10). These peaks or nodes are too small to quadrate
the rim or shoulder, but they may symbolize such quadration.
5
Not enough is known of the rough ware of the Glendora Focus to make these absences certain.
6
The typical elbow pipe of the Texarkana, Titus, and Belcher Foci is a more or less equal-armed form with a short spur or horizontal
flange projecting forward from the elbow (see Harrington 1920:Plates CIII–CIV). That of the Glendora is apparently a plain and
crude equal-arm form without projection. The Frankston pipe is a rather handsome object with arms forming an acute angle as small
as 45 degrees, while part or all of the pipe is decorated with punctates, incised, and engraved lines.
7
For examples, see Moore (1912:Figures 89–90) from the Foster site.
8
Sources are Beatty, field notes on WPA-University of Texas excavations of the Hatchel site, where 16 houses give a good record for
the Texarkana Focus; Webb (1940) for the Belcher site; Jackson (1936) for one large house at the Saunders site, the sole evidence for
Frankston Focus houses; Walker (1935) for a few notes on houses at the historic Glendora Focus site at Natchitoches, Louisiana.

The McCurtain Focus has recently been recognized by David A. Baerreis of the University of Oklahoma through two sites in McCurtain County, southeastern Oklahoma. These, the Clement (not to be confused with the Clements site in Cass County, Texas)
and the McDonald, lie on a tributary of Little River,
well to the northwest of the Red River bend. This focus probably also includes some of the more westerly
localities entered as Texarkana Focus on Figure 1, such
as Norris, Pine Creek, and Hook’s Ferry. Although
nothing has yet been published on it, the McCurtain
may be said to be closely related to the Texarkana
Focus, and like it includes shell-tempered pottery.
From the information furnished by Baerreis, the
Texarkana types Avery Engraved, Simms Engraved,
and Nash Neck Banded (all include some shell-tempered vessels) are also common McCurtain types;
Barkman Engraved occurs in McCurtain but perhaps
less commonly than in Texarkana; McKinney Plain is
questionable; and Foster Trailed-Incised, common to
both Texarkana and Belcher, appears not to occur in
the McCurtain. Though the resident ceramic types in
the two foci are quite similar, intrusive types differ. A
significant distinction in projectile points is apparent,
for dart points of any kind are extremely rare and obviously intrusive or accidentally included in the Texarkana
Focus material; on the other hand, large projectile (dart)
points are said to constitute 93 percent of total
McCurtain points. The McCurtain arrow points are
moreover distinct from the Texarkana types Maud Triangular and Bassett Pointed Stem, and more closely
resemble those of Spiro Focus (see Figure 3).

places within the circle. Diameters of these houses
vary from 16 to 22 feet. The Belcher Focus house, to
judge from those at the type site, was identical to the
Texarkana, with the minor difference of a northeasterly direction for the entranceway. Burial pits were
dug through the floor of one house (Webb 1940). At
the McCurtain Focus McDonald site there was one
circular house of the Texarkana-Belcher type, 18 feet
in diameter, with entranceway of parallel trenches directed north. Square and rectangular houses were also
noted at this site but have not been cleared.
At the Belcher site the typical Texarkana-Belcher
circular house was preceded by a rectangular house
with wall trenches, scattered interior posts or braces,
central fireplace in prepared clay basin, and a post row
entranceway to the northeast. Through its pottery and
other artifacts this house evidently belongs somewhere
in the Gibson Aspect, though to what focus is uncertain (Webb 1940:House IV).
Much more house data is needed, but if that from
the type site is reliable for each focus as a whole, the
following facts are indicated: (1) the McCurtain house
was a smaller and less carefully made replica of the
Spiro Focus two- and four-center post houses of rectangular and square ground plan; (2) the circular
Texarkana house was preceded by a very large circular structure referable to the preceding Haley Focus;
(3) the round Belcher Focus house was preceded by a
small rectangular house with wall trenches; (4) all of
these had extended entranceways except the large circular Haley (?) Focus house, the Spiro and McCurtain
entranceways were made with either post rows or
trenches, or post rows in trenches, and the Texarkana,
Belcher, and pre-Belcher were made with post rows
only. Obviously the basic ground plan, center posts,
scattered interior posts, centrally located fire basin of
clay, indefinite fireplace, and forms of entranceway,
were all more or less discrete ideas that had been combined in different ways by the various communities.
For example, the McDonald site circular house is a
combination of Texarkana-Belcher ground plan and
Spiro-McCurtain trench entranceway, a fusion which
might be expected where the cultures met areally.
The “Glendora Focus” house drawn in Figure 2
is a hypothetical one drawn from a brief sentence by
Walker (1935) for the Natchitoches site, and a few
isolated scraps of information. We can suppose that
houses of the historic period were small and round and
had no extended entranceways. Two native houses
shown by Bolton (1914) and reproduced by Harrington
(1920:Figures 45–46) from the late 17th century have
round plans and a rectangular doorway cut through the

Houses
One of the most definite distinctions between
the Texarkana and McCurtain Foci lies in the house
pattern. Houses cleared at the Clement site include a
rectangular structure with two large center posts, and
a square one with four large center posts, both with
entranceway of parallel trenches directed southwest,
and neither with a definite fireplace. This house pattern was evidently derived from the Spiro Focus (see
Figure 2), the differences being in its smaller size—25
feet square or less—its lack of a prepared, central,
clay fire basin, and its orientation off the cardinal directions.
The Texarkana house, as seen in the Hatchel
site series, was exclusively circular, had an entranceway
of parallel post rows directed to the southeast or east,
scattered interior posts or braces, and no definite fireplace location, char and ashes being found in various
34

thatch, but other details are lacking.
In the Frankston Focus we have only the very
large circular house reported from the Saunders site,
Anderson County (Jackson 1936). Evidently this house
had no large center posts, central fireplace, or extended
entranceway.
Nothing whatsoever is known of Titus Focus
houses, despite the fact that many middens and cemeteries have been excavated and looted. The Bossier
Focus is also a blank.

vated by reliable authorities which reveal attenuated
but apparently deliberate attempts to build eminences.
Moreover, the non-ceramic artifacts associated with
these structures represent types carried over from
Gibson Aspect complexes, mixed with unquestionably
Fulton Aspect pottery types. Within this great area, then,
we have just two authenticated cases to date in which
restricted elements of an essentially Gibson type of
culture survived long enough to thrust into the Fulton
pottery horizon. In neither case, apparently, did Gibson
Aspect pottery survive along with the other elements.
The “surviving” material constitutes only a small proportion of the total from each site—and this is of a
rather obviously anomalous nature relative to the whole.
One such instance has been noted in the
McCurtain Focus Clement site:

Burials
McCurtain Focus burials, to judge from the Clement and McDonald sites, were predominantly single and
extended in a dorsal position, with vessels placed about
the head and shoulders or along the sides. Some flexed
and partially flexed single burials were also found in
these sites, indicating, as in projectile styles and houses,
a carrying over of some Spiro Focus traits. Many of
these burials are of uncertain disposal because the
bones have almost completely disappeared, leaving only
pottery and a few teeth to mark the graves. Farther
north in central east Oklahoma the “Fort Coffee Focus” burials were flexed and semi-flexed as in the Spiro.
Texarkana, Belcher, Titus, Frankston, Bossier,
and Glendora burials were exclusively extended, usually on the back, and except for rare cases of multiple
interment, were single with vessels around the head
and upper parts. Occasionally vessels were also placed
at the sides and feet or between the legs; as the graves
were only slightly larger than the bodies, vessels were
placed close to the corpse and sometimes placed inside one another, presumably to conserve space. Again
we have the unfortunate soil conditions almost through
the entire area which led to rapid disintegration of bone
matter; some graves recognized only by fill and position of vessels, even the teeth having disappeared.

This site included a domiciliary mound
which was probably used as a base for a
structure although this was not detected
in the excavation. Sherds and other refuse
in the mound fill, as well as the cultural
debris in the midden zone at the base of
the mound were quite similar to the
material found in other portions of the
site so that there is no doubt that the
mound was erected by this
group…Although the surface was rather
gently rounded, the stratification in the
mound indicated a flat-topped structure
built in several major stages. Incomplete
post mold series below the mound
indicated that houses had been erected
on this area prior to the construction of
the mound (Baerreis n.d.).

A large intrusive burial pit in the “domiciliary”
mound:
appeared to start at the surface and
extended to about the base of the
mound…Approximately ten individuals
were included in the burial. Three of these
could be determined as fully extended in
a dorsal position, while two were fully
flexed…Offerings were very abundant
and were placed on the bodies, between
individuals, and at the sides of the pit
(Baerreis n.d.).

Tumulus Building
Except in two or three known cases, the actual
construction of tumuli, conical, rectangular, or square,
appears to have been totally abandoned during the
Fulton Aspect period. Remains of peoples inhabiting
the region during Fulton Aspect times have been found
on top of tumuli almost wherever these structures remain, but in those few instances in which we have
careful notes, it is quite apparent that the later peoples
merely used the tumuli built by their predecessors as
camping and burial places, probably during times of
flooding. There are, nevertheless, two locations exca-

It is of special significance that this one very
large pit sunk into the center of a flat-topped eminence

the grave walls, three long-stemmed pottery pipes, one

pair of stone copper-covered ear spools, one engraved
conch shell gorget, “shell, pearl, and seed beads, and
shell discs,” and one ground stone celt, all of which,
like the size of the grave itself, were unique for the
site. There were also 21 arrow points and 24 pottery
vessels in this grave, but the pottery at least “conforms
stylistically to the general series found at the two sites.”
All of the ten other Clement site burials were single
and lay in a midden and village area surrounding the
tumulus. None of the artifacts mentioned for the large
pit, except the pottery, are at all typical of any Fulton
Aspect focus, yet in this particular instance Baerreis
seems satisfied that the tumulus and its grave were
made by the same group of people responsible for the
site as a whole. I know of no other way to account for
this situation except by postulating a very limited survival of certain traits from a preceding culture, probably in this case the Haley Focus, although the flexed
burial idea suggests Spiro Focus practice. Only further
excavations will ultimately decide such questions.
At the Belcher site on the west side of the Red
River, a somewhat comparable situation has been discovered by Webb and Dodd (1939 and 1941). As described briefly above, this site is featured by an eminence within which were four building stages, the first
begun when the Red River floodplain was about five
feet lower than at present. The material culture complex and house of the fourth or lowest level is clearly
distinct from the top two levels, while the third is mixed
or transitional, hence the later building process was
continued on the same spot by a different cultural group.
Here again, the presence of multiple burials crowded
into small graves, pearl beads, conch shell cups or dippers, and bone and antler projectile points constitute
anomalous elements for the Fulton Aspect, while the
pottery vessels from these graves are unquestionably
of Belcher Focus types and belong to the Fulton Aspect in general. Farther up the Red River the Foster
site, in addition to most of the Belcher items named
above, has yielded copper-covered shell and limestone
ear spools and geometrically carved conch shell gorgets
with “swastika” centers (Moore 1912:591–619 and
Figures 85–121). Ceramically, the Foster site includes
both Belcher and Texarkana Focus types. Under
“Belcher Focus,” Table 6 contains both Belcher and
Foster material, as well as that of some other sites,
none of these sites yielding all the items checked.

Clay-lump or clay-grit temper, engraving and impression of different colored pigments in engraved lines,
incising, scoring, brushing, punctating, fingernail gouging, and red film were used in both Aspects, but with
quite noticeable differences in degree of popularity, in
care of execution, in design arrangement, in vessel
shapes, and portion of vessel decorated. Such differences are apparent in the various foci of each Aspect,
with stronger distinctions between the two Aspects on
the whole. While clay-grit was the principal aplastic in
both Aspects, other tempers were also used to some
extent.
Red filming is older than both Aspects, for it appears in the Marksville, Troyville, and early Coles Creek
periods in the type Woodville Red Filmed, and in the
Coles Creek period in Larto Red Filmed.23 In the Gibson
Aspect red film appears in the Haley and Spiro Foci on
a very few vessels, and is fairly common in the Sanders Focus. It has not been found in Gahagan pottery,
and on only about 15 sherds of the 97,000 recovered
from the Davis site of the Alto Focus.
In the Fulton Aspect, red filming appears on five
to ten percent of vessels in the types Avery Engraved
and Simms Engraved in the Texarkana and McCurtain
Foci, where it is sometimes combined with shell temper. It is very rare in the Belcher Focus, occurs in about
six percent of the Ripley Engraved vessels in the Titus
Focus, and is absent from the Frankston and Bossier
Foci. With the Glendora Focus, the filming technique
becomes notably more common in connection with the
type Natchitoches Engraved, which includes some
magnificent vessels from the Glendora and Keno sites
(Moore 1909). On the whole, the use of a red film
never became very popular in any of these foci or horizons, but in aesthetic effect reached its climax in vessels of the Texarkana, McCurtain, and Glendora Foci.
Shell temper also reached its greatest popularity in the
same three foci. The finest specimens, however, appear to have been made of a fine-grained, compact,
firm clay with no added aplastic.
In most foci, Fulton Aspect pottery is characterized by a predominance of clay-grit temper in both
rough “utility” ware and in polished engraved ware. In
all foci except Belcher, some vessels have pulverized
bone tempering in addition to clay-grit. The addition of
bone was noted for the Alto, Sanders, and possibly the
Spiro Foci, and constitutes a trait which was continued
in a minor or supplementary capacity from these Gibson
Aspect foci into those Fulton foci which occupied essentially the same territory.
Fulton Aspect pottery reveals the entrance of
two further tempering traits which do not appear in the

It has already been noted above that the Gibson
and Fulton Aspect ceramics were basically similar.
36

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

Texarkana, McCurtain, and Glendora Foci as additions
to the older clay-grit tempering principal in polished
wares. Rough wares continued to be tempered exclusively with clay-grit plus occasional pulverized bone.
In Belcher Focus, shell temper appears in the rough
ware types Belcher Ridged, Foster Trailed-Incised, and
Cowhide Stamped. This reversal is difficult to explain
except on the grounds of local preferences. The remaining foci—Titus, Frankston, and Bossier, were without either the shell or no-temper variations, continuing
to use coarse clay-grit in both the rough and polished
engraved wares. Presumably the reason was that these
foci lay farthest to the west and south within the Fulton
Aspect as a whole, and both principles failed to diffuse
into them before the historic period disintegration. At
the same time, some sort of selectivity must have been
operating, as shown by the Belcher Focus wares mentioned, and by such a situation as that in the Texarkana
Focus, where the types Avery Engraved and Simms
Engraved have grit, shell, or no temper, and are occasionally red-filmed, while Barkman Engraved is a fine,
polished, dark, firm ware with neither tempering nor
film.
It appears that within the Fulton Aspect some
sort of correlation exists between the number four and
the use of red film and shell temper. That is, those
engraved types which bear either film or shell temper,
or both, also show a strong tendency toward repeating
the design motif four times around the vessel. In Ripley
Engraved, common in all Titus Focus components, red
film occurs as a variation in about six percent of the
vessels, but all show an almost invariable repetition of
the design motif four times around the rims of bowls,
and bodies of bottles and jars. In the Frankston Focus
neither shell temper nor red film occur and there is no
regular number of repetitions; they vary from three to
22, more or less according to the size of the vessel.
In general, in those foci which show a tendency
toward four repetitions in the engraved designs, rough
ware jars also show this tendency. As most of these
jars do not bear regular designs, but are plain or brushed
with simple hachured lines or fingernail punctates
around the rim, the idea of quadration is symbolized
with four conventionalized rim lugs or four vertical appliqued fillets on the body; less commonly the rim is
drawn up into four peaks without, however, giving the
vessel a square mouth.
While it has commonly been supposed that
“Caddo” vessels are characterized by engraved scrolls,
the scroll motif itself actually appears only in the Belcher,
Titus, and Glendora Foci as a common decorative principle. It is rare in the Texarkana and McCurtain, and

totally absent in the Frankston and Bossier Foci. The
former two manifest a wide variety of rectilinear and
curvilinear designs, with tiny scrolls sometimes used to
flank the main design; Frankston designs show crosshatched areas and bands, oval panels, back-to-back
arches, and concentric circles; Bossier designs consist
almost wholly of narrow hatched and cross-hatched
bands running in curves and arches or diagonally across
the rim, etc.
It seems likely that the beautiful pottery of the
Glendora Focus had its origins in the Belcher and Titus
Foci, rather than in any of the others. This relationship
is quite apparent if we discount the wide use of shell
temper and red film in the Glendora, and refer to design motifs. The typical meandering band of
Natchitoches Engraved which doubles back on itself
four times around the vessel and is flanked with plain
disks set in cross-hatched areas, was apparently anticipated in the four-times repeated scrolls of Ripley
and Taylor Engraved. Occasional bottles of the Belcher
and Titus Foci also show the use of extended bases
and bulbous necks as in Glendora Focus and Natchez
(Fatherland Incised) vessels.
Neck banding of jars was a fairly common feature of the Fulton Aspect except for Belcher Focus,
the farthest east, and Glendora, the latest. In McCurtain
and Texarkana these vessels were predominantly shell
tempered and each neck coil neatly crimped with the
fingers. In the Titus, Frankston, and Bossier the coils
were left as rough, overlapping shingles, partly
smoothed with the fingers, or crudely lined along the
seams with a blunt instrument. As in the Gibson Aspect Alto Focus, these treatments were always limited
to the jar necks.
It is not to be expected that the reader will gain
an intimate knowledge of the ceramics of these Aspects through the very rough comparisons given here.
The point is that there is no simple way to discuss pottery problems in the “Caddo area.” Each focus demonstrates a peculiar set of practices and variations that
must be reported in detail before their relationships can
be fully comprehended.
Copper and Shell
Work in copper is almost totally absent from the
Fulton Aspect. The sole exceptions to date are from
the Foster site on Red River (Moore 1912) where shell
and limestone ear spools have been found with copper
covering; even these could have been gained by trade.
Conch shell dippers have been found in the Foster and
Belcher sites, but these are usually undecorated and,
37

Alex D. Krieger

except for two Belcher specimens, not closely comparable to the engraved shell specimens of the “Southern
Cult.” Otherwise, conch shell columella were cut into
short barrel-shaped and long cylindrical beads, probably in every focus. Peculiar small objects, apparently
effigies of insects or animals, have been found in some
Belcher and Titus Focus sites (Moore 1912:Figures 89–
90).

in all these foci. The White Alexandria Sandstone hones
of the Gibson Aspect are unknown in the Fulton. Long,
slim, finely finished bone pins, occasionally with carved
heads, are found in Texarkana, Belcher, and McCurtain
Focus sites, but otherwise only crude bone slivers were
used as awls. An interesting feature is seen in the occurrence of small button-shaped labrets of pottery and
bone in the Belcher and Titus Foci; this trait has not
been noted within the Gibson Aspect, where various
kinds of ear spools in different materials were evidently
common objects.
The presence of a few other items is checked in
Table 6. It seems abundantly demonstrated that the
total range of material objects in the Fulton Aspect was
considerably poorer and simpler than in the Gibson.
For the most part, pottery decoration was also simpler,
the lines bolder, and the elements often very poorly
executed. Within the prehistoric Fulton horizon, the best
workmanship, at least in pottery, is found in the
McCurtain, Texarkana, and Belcher Foci, all more or
less centered in the general region of the Red River
big bend, from the Little River into northwestern Louisiana. Some Glendora Focus pottery is of very superior workmanship, but from what little is known of the
rest of Glendora material culture, its products were
already decadent.

Pipes
Throughout the Aspect, the only pipe forms were
short, thick, elbow-shaped objects of pottery. In those
of all the foci except Frankston and Glendora the axes
of bowl and stem meet at right angles, but the heel
slopes back from bowl to stem, and usually a flange or
spur juts forward from the bowl; the bowl is conical
and the stem end cylindrical (Moore 1912:Figures 66,
133, and 136b, d–e; Harrington 1920:Plates 103–104).
The Frankston pipe features arms forming a distinctly
acute angle, the bowl being conical and the stem projecting higher than the edge of the bowl, and both stem
and bowl are usually covered with incised lines and
punctates filled with white pigment. The Glendora pipe
is very simple with the arms of equal length, cylindrical, and at right angles so that it is often difficult to
distinguish bowl from stem. These are plain or decorated with simple scratches and often shell tempered.

CHRONOLOGICAL POSITION OF
THE FULTON ASPECT

Projectile Points
The Hatchel Site
Whereas the Gibson Aspect arrow points are of
two major forms: stemmed, with the stem ranging from
parallel-edged to fan-shaped and lozenge, and the blade
edges curved and triangular with side notches, Fulton
Aspect arrow points are either simple triangles with
recurved edges or have sharply pointed stems. Dart
points are said to constitute 93 percent of the McCurtain
Focus points, quite an anomalous proportion for this
Aspect. Elsewhere, only the Frankston seems to have
an associated dart point type, a stubby blade with a
broad, somewhat expanding stem. Dart points are
sometimes found in sites primarily belonging to the other
foci but associations with the complexes are uncertain. The Titus Focus is featured by numerous very
large stemmed points which are far too heavy for anything but spears or lances.

A site on the A. J. Hatchel property 12 miles
northwest of Texarkana was excavated by the WPAUniversity of Texas State-wide Archaeological Survey in 1938–39. W. C. Beatty, Jr., was the field foreman and due to his excellent records, this site serves
as an important key to chronological relations in the
Red River bend area. The remarks made here are the
result of my own analysis of the material and Beatty’s
field reports. The site included a “mound,” village, and
cemetery in the village. Only six burials were found in
the mound proper.
At the time of excavation the mound bulk was
190 feet long (NE–SW), 145 feet wide, and 30.4 feet
high, with an oval, humped shape. Upon dissection it
proved to be composed of (1) a small, rectangular, flattopped structure of clay seven feet high, 70 feet long
by 40 feet wide on top, with steep sides and indications
of a clay ramp in the middle of its southeastern side; no
steps or logs were noted in this possible ramp; (2) a
larger rectangular, flat-topped structure 13 feet high,

about 136 feet long and 75 feet wide on top (partly
eroded), which was built completely over the first
tumulus although barely covering it on one side; (3) a
huge midden mantle of stratified refuse which completely covered the second tumulus to a depth of 14
feet in the middle, thinning toward the flanks, and containing at least 16 houses and five burials at different
levels; (4) evidence of a brief surface occupation not
stratigraphically separate from the midden mantle, but
containing numerous sherds and one burial referable
to the Glendora Focus although Caucasian objects were
not found. Although six interments were made in the
mantle, the underlying tumuli contained no burials, nor
did the excavations reveal tangible evidence of buildings having been erected on the primary and secondary tumuli.
After the whole eminence had been systematically removed, the area underneath was only partly
excavated, revealing one great circular house 50 feet
in diameter, with no extended entranceway, no definite
fireplace, and—oddly for such a building—no interior
posts or braces. It seems possible that if the entire
sub-tumulus area had been explored that at least one
of the great Gahagan-Haley multiple burial pits might
have been found.
Despite their bulk, the primary and secondary
tumuli contained only about 60 decorated and 200 plain
body sherds. These compare quite closely with Haley
Focus types, hence these two superimposed tumuli and
the large house, representing Stage I of this site, constitute a probable Haley Focus component.
The midden mantling the secondary tumulus, on
the other hand, contained some 19,000 sherds, of which
2,800 can be typed (the remainder being plain and
brushed body sherds), 200 other artifacts, 16 houses,
and five burials. Except for its final surface occupation
and one other burial, this part (Stage II) may be taken
as a type component for the Texarkana Focus. It includes intrusive pottery from the neighboring Belcher
and Titus Foci. The surface (Stage III) represents a
protohistoric complex referable to Glendora Focus; a
nearby site with the same sort of Glendora material
also yielded glass beads and intrusions of Natchez pottery.
Besides the cultural stratification revealed here,
it is important that the Hatchel site shows prolonged
use of the tumulus bulk by a later people who did
no further intentional building. Almost wherever
such bulks were to be found, the peoples of the Fulton
Aspect made use of them to greater or less extent,
likely as convenient camping places on the open floodplains. Surface pottery and burials belonging to the lat-

est culture horizon in the entire area quite regularly
prove to be distinct from the material actually within
the tumulus bulks; the latter usually prove to belong
either to the Coles Creek culture or the Gibson Aspect. In the case of the Crenshaw site, the sub-tumulus
graves clearly belong to the Coles Creek, similar graves
with different pottery belong to the Haley Focus and
were made in the tumuli, and shallow single graves in
the tumulus surfaces and surrounding land belong to
the Belcher and Texarkana Foci. Combining the
Crenshaw and Hatchel sequences, we have good evidence for the relative position of Coles Creek, Haley
Focus, Texarkana and Belcher, and lastly the
protohistoric and historic Glendora.
The 16 houses built at different levels in the
Hatchel mantle (Stage II) indicate more than a casual
occupation. Their presence in association with a culture succeeding that of the actual tumulus construction
is of unusual significance in relation to the Caddo and
whether or not they were “mound builders.” Swanton
(1942:154) makes the statement that:
In later times the Caddo did not have the
reputation of being a mound-building
people. In the sketch reproduced by
Bolton, however, one structure, probably
a temple, is located upon a mound, and
De Mezieres states specifically that the
temple of the Nabedache was built upon
a mound which ‘their ancestors erected’
[Bolton 1914, Vol. 2, p. 263]. This use of
mounds for temples, even artificial
mounds, does not prove that the Caddo
erected them, but there is no good reason
to doubt it since the erection of mounds
was common to all the tribes of the lower
Mississippi south of the Quapaw.

This remark strikes very close to the archaeological evidence, except that the “reason to doubt” that
the Caddo erected mounds now becomes apparent
through the composition of such sites as Hatchel. It is
clearly quite possible that the structure shown by Bolton
on top of a high, humped mound (not flat-topped) was
analogous to the houses built by Texarkana Focus
people on top of the Haley Focus tumuli. In fact, it is
not outside the bounds of possibility that the mound
and house in question represent the Hatchel place itself, for the location given by Bolton must be quite close
to Hatchel. Also, there is no need to interpret this house
“as probably a temple” for it does not appear in the
drawing to be any larger than the Hatchel houses, 22
to 30 feet in diameter.

the sixteenth century, the Fulton may have covered a
century and a half, roughly 1550 to 1700 or 1725 A.D.
More probably, it began as late as 1600 A.D., or possibly even after that.
This estimate of age is about the best that can
be offered at present. One century back from 1700
A.D. may seem a very short time, but on the other
hand, each focus is a remarkably homogenous unit of
culture, the sites are usually quite shallow, and each
existed for a time insufficient to produce any noticeable sequential style change in pottery or other artifacts, so far as can be determined. For example, the
14-foot thickness of the Hatchel mantle was divided
into eight separate layers by Beatty, but in tabulating
the artifact and pottery types I can find nothing but
exactly the same styles ranging from bottom to top;
Belcher and Titus intrusions are also quite the same
through these levels. Elsewhere, level-ground sites are
usually no more than one to three feet thick.
For the present, it may be stated that the Gibson
Aspect must have terminated some time in the late
sixteenth century and extended back perhaps to 1500
or 1400 A.D.; i.e., its existence was contemporaneous
with a late (?) Coles Creek horizon, and was thus presumably later than both Marksville and Troyville. The
Fulton Aspect may then be dated at roughly 1600 to
1700 or 1725 A.D., the Glendora Focus occupying
about the time 1675 to 1700 or 1725 A.D. or so. Perhaps some time for transition should be allowed, but on
the whole the change from Gibson to Fulton seems to
have been quite abrupt, most non-ceramic elements
disappearing suddenly, while many of the ceramic traits
continue, but in altered forms and combinations.

As for the Nabedache temple built upon an eminence which “their ancestors erected,” this agrees with
the archaeological evidence, and it seems natural that
such people would refer to the builders as their ancestors or predecessors. West and southwest from the
Red River valley true tumuli are extremely rare and
this practice of later use was correspondingly rare.
These notes do not, however, preclude the practice of mound or tumulus building from Caddoan culture, for we have already noted the two cases in which
an attenuated form of building appears in the Belcher
and Clement sites. In the former, houses were erected
four different times, each being covered over with clean
sand after its destruction, then a new house built upon
leveled fill, until the eminence reached a height of about
14 feet. In the Clement site, a low, flat-topped tumulus
contained a large multiple burial with artifacts distinctive of the Gibson Aspect. In both cases, however, the
accompanying pottery belongs to the respective foci
of the Fulton Aspect. Considering the area covered by
this Aspect, the practice of erecting tumuli had almost
completely disappeared well before the historic period
began. As the Fulton Aspect almost beyond doubt represents Caddoan speaking peoples, these can be said
not to have been “mound builders” except in rare cases.
They preferred to make use of previously built eminences or to camp on level ground.
Age of the Fulton Aspect
This may be simply stated as extending from
approximately the close of the Gibson Aspect period
on into historic times. If the Southern Cult and the
Gibson Aspect existed or terminated in the middle of

ETHNOLOGICAL IDENTITIES

but the available data have been ably and exhaustively
compiled by Swanton (1942:7–16 and Figure 1). While
his locations are based on historic locations and thus
can be tied directly only to Glendora Focus components, the same sites were in some cases probably
occupied by the immediate ancestors of the historic
generations. For example, Swanton’s location of the
Upper Nasoni tribe or village in the northeastern corner of Texas conforms very closely to the Hatchel site24,
on the surface of which were found a number of
Glendora Focus sherds; during the preceding occupation which we have called the Texarkana Focus, the
inhabitants may also have been Nasoni who at that
time made a somewhat different pottery.
This sort of correlation with recorded tribal locations would make a fruitful study in itself. For the
present, we may say that Swanton’s locations conform
quite well with two principal foci: Glendora and
Frankston, the former agreeing with tribes or villages
of the “Caddo proper” or “Red River Caddo,” and the
latter with the Cenis group or Hasinai Confederacy.
Thus the points labeled by Swanton as Nanatsoho
Points, Nanatsoho (1), Nanatsoho (2), Natchitoches
(upper), Nasoni (upper), Kadohadacho (1),
Kadohadacho (2), Yatasi, Natchitoches (lower), and
Ouachita conform to known locations of Glendora Focus components—if not exactly, at least reasonably
so. Swanton’s Kadohadacho (2) has been identified by
C. H. Webb (personal communication) as the exact
location of a site observed by the Freeman-Custis Exploring Expedition in 1806 (Swanton 1942:79–80). The
expedition’s guides remembered this (the present Foster site) as a former Caddoan town. Archaeologically,
the Foster site combines traits of the Belcher and
Texarkana Foci, neither of which has ever been found
in association with Caucasian material, but as the site
has only been superficially explored (Moore 1912; and
recent amateurs), it may very well be that historic
material of a later occupation can be found there.
In central east Texas, in the valleys of the
Neches and Angelina rivers, Swanton locates a number of Hasinai groups, southern relatives of the “Red
River” Caddo. Nabedache may be the Richard Patton
archaeological site, which has yielded Caucasian material and a pottery type (Patton Engraved) character-

rom the foregoing it should be clear that the Fulton
Aspect can be assumed to represent the material
culture of Southern Caddoan tribes in a number of local subdivisions. Each of these divisions possessed a
somewhat different array of traits, many of which can
be explained on the basis of relative geographic position, others to limited continuance from former cultures
in the same region. Within each focus as a whole there
must have been experimentation and invention, for commonly each component reveals distinctive variations
within the executional patterns or “types” which characterize the focal aggregates.
Whether or not the Gibson Aspect also represents Caddoan peoples culturally ancestral to the Caddo
of Fulton Aspect is problematical. Ceramically, the answer would be yes. On the other hand, considering the
sudden abandonment of such practices as tumulus building (with rare exceptions), elaborate conch and copper
working, stone and pottery effigy pipes, spatulate celts,
large multiple graves, stone pipes, long-stemmed pottery pipes, ear spools, Copena blades, and so on, and
the entrance of certain new ideas such as single graves
with offerings around the head, pottery elbow pipes,
shell or no temper in pottery, etc., it can hardly be doubted
that a turnover of major significance took place.
Swanton, however, believes that the DeSoto expedition found Caddoan speaking peoples in the lower Red
River valley and perhaps farther west. According to
the dating problems as seen at present, this suggests
that both Aspects represented Caddoans.
Because of the fact that non-ethnic labels obviate the confusions inherent in ethnic labels for archaeological cultures, such a term as Gibson Aspect may be
used to designate this earlier horizon, whether or not it
can satisfactorily be shown to represent Caddoan speaking peoples. Likewise, Fulton Aspect serves to differentiate the cultures which are almost certainly those of
Caddoan peoples from the generalized term “Caddo”
applied to virtually all the remains from a very great
area.
Within the Fulton Aspect, it seems possible to
identify a few components as the actual villages occupied by known Caddoan groups when visited by early
explorers. The names and locations of many of these
villages have been the source of much controversy,
41

istic of historic locations of the Frankston Focus. A site
in the modern town of Nacogdoches probably conforms
to the ethnic Nacogdoches and likewise includes contact material. Others, such as Nacao, Nasoni (lower),
Nadaco, Nabiti, Hainai, etc., may eventually be specifically identified with Frankston Focus components.
In the region between the Red and Sabine Rivers, mainly in the Sulphur River valley, there are nu-

merous sites of the Titus Focus; between the Hasinai
area and north central Louisiana, of the Bossier Focus; north of the Red River, of the McCurtain Focus;
but there appear to be no recorded tribal locations which
would fall within these regions, even though some of
the sites within them bear Glendora Focus pottery and
Caucasian objects.

AFFILIATIONS WITH SURROUNDING PROVINCES
complex of material traits. Of these latter we have
nowhere near the quantity of specimens yielded by the
previous flint or burnt-rock midden cultures, and the
specimens are nearly always surface finds whether on
rock middens, caves, or open terrace sites. This late
complex is recognized almost entirely by the presence
of several true arrow point styles and pottery; agriculture was presumably practiced to some extent, as
among the historic Tonkawa.
The pottery of this late horizon (Spanish Fort
Focus) is almost wholly of one type (Leon Plain) which
belongs neither to the Southwest nor the Mississippi
Pattern. It is a compact ware usually tempered with
pulverized bone, a tough polished surface is brown,
orange, gray, and yellow colors, in the shape of jars
with tall vertical necks and rounded bodies with convex bases. Although its origin is conjectural it appears
to be associated with late prehistoric and historic southern Plains peoples such as the Wichita-speaking tribes,
the Kichai, Bidai, Taovaya, and Tonkawa. While often
found in historic association, it also must have been
known before this time, at least in north central Texas,
and presumably in Oklahoma. As a guess, it may have
come into this region at about 1600 A.D., for on some
sites there are intrusions of Fulton Aspect pottery, almost all of types characteristic of the Frankston Focus. Sherds of Frankston types have been found as far
west as La Junta on the Rio Grande at the Conchos
confluence (Kelley n.d.), San Angelo, Abilene, and
Vernon, Texas, possibly also as far west as the New
Mexico boundary line.
While these distributions cannot be discussed in
detail here, the point of significance is this: Frankston
Focus (Fulton Aspect) sherds have been found intrusively far west across Texas from the homeland of this
Focus in the Neches and Angelina valleys of eastern
Texas; they occur in association with the type Leon
Plain and the arrow point styles which mark an overlay known as Spanish Fort Focus on the central Texas
flint and burnt-rock midden hunting cultures. Before
the latter came to an end, however, some intrusions
from the Gibson Aspect can be noted. There are several examples of Copena-type recurved blades, one
engraved gorget with Southern Cult motifs, and three
or four specimens of the Alto Focus dart type Wells

igure 1 shows the approximate western limits of
the Gibson and Fulton Aspects, limits synonymous
with those of the Mississippi Pattern during the two
time periods represented. Except for the bulge to the
Chupek site on the Brazos River, these westward
boundaries are approximately the same, and there is a
fairly close agreement between the limits of the Mississippi Pattern and the western limit of pine forests, at
least in Texas from the Red River southward between
the Neches and Trinity rivers.
Essentially, then, agricultural, pottery-making
Mississippian peoples occupied all or most of the territory west to the watershed between the Neches and
Trinity rivers, and a few settlements such as the Chupek
site were made as far west as the Brazos, although the
latter place may merely have gained its pottery by trade
from farther east. West of the Trinity and Brazos
stretches a vast oak and brush area, most of it dissected limestone country known as the Edwards Plateau, but including also great expanses of open, grassy,
rolling plain. Through nearly all this central Texas area,
two major cultural horizons are quite evident. One, of
unknown duration, is known chiefly through its great
numbers of flint artifacts—dart points, scrapers, “drills,”
gravers, choppers, flat axes, etc.—and simple stone
grinding slabs and oval manos, all of which are associated with heaps of burned and broken limestone which
represent the discarded remains of hearth stones; these
have usually been called “burnt-rock mounds” but are
actually only midden heaps. Smaller heaps and single
hearths of the same nature have been found buried
beneath gravel deposits of the Colorado and other rivers to a depth of 25 to 30 feet. The age of these deepest remains of hearths and stone implements is a complicated problem in stream terracing, erosion, and deposition which is being discussed in detail by J. C. Kelley
(n.d.).
Whatever the beginning date of these central
Texas flint cultures may have been, their terminal date
may have approached historic times, though some time
before contacts began, the Edwards Plateau and adjacent regions were more or less covered by a different
43

Alex D. Krieger

Contracting Stem, all from non-pottery sites between
the Brazos and Colorado rivers. While the evidence is
scanty, it nevertheless is indicated that a horizontal relationship existed between the Mississippian Gibson
Aspect and the terminal phases of the non-pottery, nonarrow point central Texas (Edwards Plateau) flint cultures at some time between about 1500 and 1600 A.D.
Later, from about 1600 to 1700 A.D., and perhaps into
the 18th century, communication and trade was maintained on an increased scale between the Fulton Aspect Mississippian horizon and the pottery-arrow pointagriculture peoples of the northern and central parts of
Texas who overlay or replaced the previous hunting
peoples. The latest culture of the central regions maintained a character of its own, however, which was neither Mississippian nor Southwestern but more of a
southerly manifestation of Plains culture, combining
pottery, bow, and desultory agriculture with a strong
dependence on bison hunting. This indicated relationship is charted on Figure 4.

poorly smoothed and rarely decorated with simple parallel lines, punctates, or nodes, and apparently made
only in jar shapes with globular body and short, flaring
rim. Interestingly, this pottery rather closely resembles
some of that in the St. Francis complex of the Mississippi valley in eastern Arkansas. A variety of bison bone
tools occur in the sites: skull bone and scapula hoes,
scapula knives with carved handles, cannon bone chisels or fleshers, and ribs with notches along the inner
edge. There are also numerous deer bone awls, grooved
stone mauls, abundant small snub-nosed scrapers and
projectile (arrow) points in several forms, mainly plain
triangular and triangular with two side notches and base
notch, but also some stemmed, barbed, and serratededge forms which have not yet been analyzed and
named. Grinding tools include both a simple seed slab
with one-hand mano used in rotary motion, and a better shaped, more or less rectangular slab with large,
flat, oval mano evidently used with a one- or two-hand
back-and-forth motion and sometimes worn into a
wedge shape; the latter metate end motion suggests a
Southwestern form for corn grinding that had diffused
eastward into the southern Plains. A few sherds of one
Southwestern pottery type, Chupadero Black-on-White,
have been found on these sites and though the association is not proved, they probably indicate the date of
Henrietta Focus.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH
THE SOUTHWEST
It is possible to trace archaeological relationships
between the Southwestern and Mississippian cultures.
Again, the evidence is slim but a number of facts of
interest are indicated. In order to bridge the intervening area, two foci which, though their exact content is
difficult to state because of insufficient controlled excavation, may be briefly outlined.

The Antelope Creek Focus
This is a name which I suggest for the wellknown Texas Panhandle remains featured by slab-lined
circular house pits suggestive of Basket Maker dwellings, a cordmarked pottery (Borger Cordmarked), numerous bone tools on the whole similar to those of
Henrietta Focus, well shaped true metates and manos,
fine side-notched triangular arrow points, and an
economy based jointly on agriculture and bison hunting. This Focus or related material probably extended
well into New Mexico, western and Panhandle Oklahoma, and south perhaps to the vicinity of Lubbock,
Texas. The works of Studer, Moorehead, Holden, and
Johnston should be consulted (see References Cited).
The dates of this culture are known with some accuracy through the intrusion of Period A Biscuit Ware
and Little Colorado Glaze I and II sherds, which would
give a date of about 1300 to 1475 A.D. or early Pueblo
IV.25 No other Southwestern pottery types have been
reported for these sites.
Comparing the Henrietta and Antelope Creek
Foci, the latter must have closed at about 1475 or 1500
A.D., while the former, through its possible Chupadero

The Henrietta Focus
This is a southern Plains-like manifestation which
in Texas occupied roughly the Red River valley from
its northward hump west of the Arkansas-Oklahoma
line, westward to about the Texas Panhandle-Oklahoma
line; southward to the upper bow of the Brazos River
and its confluence with Clear Fork; eastward to a point
about 80 miles east of Dallas; and north to the Red
River; undoubtedly a similar complex also extended over
much of southern Oklahoma, especially in the Washita
valley. Its content in Texas is known mainly from the
work and publications of Adolf Witte of Henrietta (see
References Cited), and from the unpublished excavations of the WPA-University of Texas State-wide Archaeological Survey in the upper Brazos River basin.
Most significant is the fact that the economic basis for
this culture lay in agriculture combined with bison hunting. Only one type of pottery was made, Nocona Plain,
a rough ware usually tempered with coarse shell flakes,
44

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

intrusions, could have lasted until 1600 A.D. or later.
We have no direct evidence on whether one Focus
preceded the other or whether they overlapped. Still,
the differences in Southwestern intrusions must mean
something. H. P. Mera (July 1942 communication) informs me that Chupadero Black-on-White was probably made from sometime in the 13th century on into
the 16th, when a new type replaced it, and “it can not
be trusted to indicate a more definite time horizon.”
Mera (1943) discusses the evidence for pottery sequences in southeastern New Mexico in detail. At
present, the date of 1300 to 1475 A.D. for the Antelope Creek Focus in the Texas Panhandle seems quite
reasonable, especially in view of the nature of its pottery. Chupadero could overlap this period but as a few
sherds of it have appeared across north Texas almost
to Louisiana and it is unmixed with other Southwestern
types, a different age is indicated, presumably a later
one for the resident Henrietta type, Nocona Plain, is
commonly shell tempered. Moreover, at the T. M. Sanders site near the Red River at the western extreme of
the Gibson Aspect (see Figure 1), we have evidence
of the mingling of three foci on the surface, all of them
above the Sanders Focus complex found in graves below the surface. This surface mixture contains sherds
and fragmentary artifacts of the Texarkana, Titus, and
Henrietta Foci, the first two of the Fulton Aspect, the
third a Plains-like culture immediately adjacent to Fulton
Aspect on the west. Moreover, Henrietta intrusions in
Texarkana (and McCurtain?) Focus components continue down the Red River to about its big bend.
In this manner we have some evidence of a continuous intrusive association from the Puebloan country nearly to the Mississippi River through a series of
cultural expressions all of which were agricultural and
pottery-making with the bow the principal weapon. This
continuity must have been in existence by 1600 A.D.,
possibly somewhat earlier.
If this be true, then it is not unlikely that the archaeologist will find more specific evidence of mutual
exchange of ideas between the Southeast and Southwest after, say, 1600 A.D. Indications of such interchange, if not the proof, include the following: we have
already noted that a “neck banding” treatment was
used on jars in the Alto Focus of the Gibson Aspect,
although this has not been found on pottery of the Sanders Focus, which also occupied a position on the western frontier of the Mississippi Pattern presumably at
about the same time. However, there is considerably
more evidence of trading activity in the Davis site material (type site for Alto Focus) than in any other site in
eastern Texas. Besides the Alto pottery types found to

the Brazos River, a few flint artifact types found in the
focus also appear as far as the Colorado River of central Texas, and conversely, several projectile, drill, axe,
and scraper types of a central Texas flint were found
at the Davis site. It is thus within the bounds of possibility that the type Duren Neck Banded represents an
idea gained through some remote Puebloan contact.
In the later Fulton Aspect the idea of neck banding was more widely spread, being found in the
Frankston, Bossier, Titus, Texarkana, and McCurtain
Foci—most of the neck-banded specimens in the latter two foci being shell tempered. In the same two,
Texarkana and McCurtain, the treatment itself is elaborated, each coil being crimped to form a corrugated
effect, although no geometric patterns resulted. Compared to Puebloan corrugation, we face the fact that
the treatment was invariably confined to the rim or
neck in the Mississippian foci; also that the intervening
Plains-like foci reveal no such ceramic trait. In the
Southwest, neck banding or rim corrugation, without
similar treatment of the vessel bodies, occurs, as I understand it, at two different times: Basket Maker III–
Pueblo I, and Late Pueblo IV. In Pueblo II through
Early Pueblo IV corrugation was a complex technique
applied to the entire vessel bodies. According to the
datings reckoned for the Gibson and Fulton Aspects,
any possibility of influence from the Southwest must
be confined to Late Pueblo IV, which would correspond to Glaze IV, 1550–1600 A.D., and Glaze V, 1600–
1700 A.D. (Kidder 1936:610). Possibly even the Modern period, 1700–1838 A.D. (Kidder 1936:610) must
be considered too.
The Fulton Aspect neck-banded vessels, oddly
enough, seem most like those of Basket Maker III and
Pueblo I, both in body and rim shape, and in the treatment and size of neck coils.26 But as these vessels are
associated with the eastern shell-temper horizon or foci
contemporaneous with that horizon, any direct connection with such an early Anasazi period seems to be
ruled out. Other possible affiliations between the two
areas, to be mentioned directly, consistently date into
Late Pueblo IV, and it seems that the neck banding
principles in the Mississippi foci must also date within
this period; independently an estimate of 1600 to 1700
A.D. has already been reached for the Fulton Aspect
by different methods, viz., the DeSoto expedition and
the “Southern Cult.”
Neck banding represents an idea adopted in the
Alto Focus, and later in several Fulton Aspect foci,
whether or not its origin was in the Pueblo region. The
vessels themselves are wholly in agreement with the
rest of the Mississippian ceramic tradition in respect to
45

Alex D. Krieger

clay, temper, texture, finish, etc., and cannot be
Puebloan trade pieces. Besides the general temporal
agreements cited, one further item supports the probability that the banding idea came from the Southwest:
one small corrugated body sherd of unidentifiable type
but distinctly Southwestern in paste and texture has
been found on the surface of the J. E. Galt site in Franklin
County, northeast Texas. This is a Titus Focus site with
some Texarkana Focus intrusions and has also yielded
quite a number of unusually well made sherds of the
Titus Focus type Leesburg Neck Banded.27
Other ceramic traits are comparable between
late Pueblo and Fulton Aspect. One may note a particular bowl shape which runs through Glaze IV and V
and continues into Modern times (after 1700). This has
a vertical or inverted rim and the outer rim surface
varies from slightly convex to slightly concave, but is
often flat; the body is wide and either convex across
the bottom or has a flat base. I am unfamiliar with the
fluctuations in this shape, and the combination of specific designs with shape details through the periods
mentioned, but as a cursory survey would point to certain specimens and outlines shown by Kidder (1936:Figures 140a–c, 145a–c, 185a–f, 189a–c, 218a–e, and
222a–e) as examples of this particular form of bowl.
Possibly this bowl evolved from earlier Southwestern
periods into the form just cited for Glaze IV–V and
Modern; on the other hand, with about the same variations in rim angle, curvature, and proportion to body, as
well as the bottom and base, this shape is strikingly like
the “carinated” bowl which is the most common vessel shape in Alto and Sanders Foci of the Gibson Aspect and all foci of the Fulton Aspect except Glendora.
The differences lie chiefly in decorative media and technique, and interior swelling of some Glaze bowl rims.
Other comparable examples of this bowl form
with specific dates are shown by Mera (1939) as follows: Plate XIV, Tewa Polychrome from Astialakwa,
a town occupied during the Pueblo Rebellion, 1680–
1693; Plates XXXVI and XXXVII, Kotyiti Glaze Polychrome from Cuarai, a site abandoned about 1674, and
Astialakwa, respectively; Plate XLVI, Puname Polychrome, “date circa 1750.” Kidder (1931:Figure 86,
1936:Figures 247a, e, h and 249a, c–e) also show bowls
of the same essential shape.
The painted and glazed decorations of the
Puebloan specimens are of course radically differentiated from the Fulton Aspect engraved vessels, but might
be explained by continuation of resident decorative
techniques applied to introduced vessel forms. The
bowls illustrated by Kidder (1936:Figures 247a–b, e,
h–i, and 248a–j) as representative of the type Plain

Red found in late Glaze V, are, to judge only from the
illustrations, so strikingly like bowls of Sanders Plain of
the Sanders Focus that it would be difficult to separate
them.
All this could, of course, be discounted as a purely
superficial resemblance were it not that still other features between the two areas are quite as comparable.
For example, “striated” or brushed surface treatment
in late Pueblo IV (Kidder 1936:Figures 262, 264) is
quite like that found on jars of Winfield Brushed and
Bullard Brushed of the Titus and Frankston Foci, respectively. Again, jars decorated with fingernail gougings
(Kidder 1936:Figure 263) resemble the same technique
in the Titus, Frankston, Sanders, and Alto Foci. Gouging was a common jar body relief in the latter two foci,
while in the first two jars were commonly brushed or
gouged (or both) around the rim. The type Potsuwi’i
Incised of Glaze IV (Kidder 1936:370 and Figures
293a–e) has hachured designs roughly cut into the plastic clay in much the same manner and arrangement as
may be found in nearly all Fulton Aspect foci. These
treatments likewise appear to be late and anomalous in
Pueblo history.
Swanton (1942:238) has made this statement:
Even in aboriginal times the Caddo
apparently resorted to trade more than
many of the neighboring people. They
were active in sending salt to the tribes
along the Mississippi River and bow
wood in all directions, as far west even as
the Pueblos, but these enterprises cannot
be said to differentiate them from their
neighbors. They did, however, make it
easy for them to open up trade with the
Spanish and French.

Thus the archaeological specimens cited above
tend to support the statement by Swanton that trade
existed in aboriginal times; they further serve to trace
this trade back to about 1600 A.D., perhaps earlier,
and also to show that certain ceramic modifications
could well have resulted from contact between the Rio
Grande Pueblo area and the westernmost Mississippian foci. Taken individually, the items mentioned could
of course be purely fortuitous similarities; taken together
with the temporal agreements, the case is, in my opinion, fairly substantial.
A further interesting problem concerns possible
remote connections between the early Mogollon Phases
of southwestern New Mexico and “the Caddo area.”
This matter may best be discussed in connection with
the Plains province.
46

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area
Considered individually, these traits would
be meaningless, but collectively they
build up into a substantial case. The
suggestion of affiliation with the east is
made only in a general way; no individual
eastern group can be singled out as direct
relatives. If the connection exists, it must
be with a generalized hunting-agricultural
stage of about the type represented by
Strong’s Upper Republican Culture, or
Signal Butte III.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE PLAINS
In 1934 the term “Caddoan Root” was advanced
by Gladwin and Gladwin in their culture-classification
system in an attempt to account for the distinctly nonAnasazian or non-Puebloan cultures found in the
Mogollon region of southwestern New Mexico. Gladwin
(1942) has recently reviewed the history of his theory
that the Georgetown and San Francisco Phases of the
Mogollon were related in some ways to the archaeological cultures of the Caddoan linguistic stock, namely
the Pawnee, Wichita, and Caddo or Red River branches.
Haury (1936b:124) has defined this concept:

Gladwin (1934, 1942) hints strongly of a belief
that early Mogollon pottery, especially red-filmed ware,
may have been more specifically connected with that
of the Red River Caddo or their neighbors, rather than
with other branches of the whole Caddoan stock. In
my opinion, there is some basis for this theory, but not
in connection with “eastern Arkansas,” etc. Rather,
the closest ceramic similarity seems to be between San
Francisco Red of the Mogollon and the type Sanders
Plain, which is sometimes red-filmed, a diagnostic type
of the Sanders Focus. As we have noted, this focus
occupies a position at the western frontier of the Gibson
Aspect, the type site being on the Red River about 80
airline miles west of the Oklahoma-Arkansas line. In
the section on Ethnological Identities it was held that
some question exists as to whether or not this focus,
and the Gibson Aspect as a whole, may be taken to
represent Caddoan speaking peoples. On the other
hand, this resemblance in pottery types may be purely
accidental, for it is almost certain that some seven centuries must have separated the two horizons: terminal
San Francisco Phase at about 900 A.D., and Sanders
at about 1600 A.D. Furthermore, in the preceding section it is suggested that Sanders Plain vessels quite
closely resemble polychrome bowls of Glaze IV and V
(late Pueblo IV) and Plain Red of late Glaze V in shape
and finish; the possibility of a past connection here
seems much more likely than with Mogollon pottery.
In other respects, such as “pit houses with graded
site entrances,” Haury’s list, as he says, is non-specific but may suggest some relationship with a “generalized hunting-agricultural stage of about the type represented by Strong’s Upper Republican Culture, or Signal Butte III.” The problem of house affiliations is, however, much more complex than this, as may be seen in
the survey made by Sayles (1937) in the Snaketown
paper. The early Mogollon houses with extended
entranceways are in some ways comparable with early
Hohokam, and the latter, with square plan and four
large interior posts, are much more like the Plains or
Upper Republican houses than are the Mogollon, which

The term Caddoan Root refers to a
generalized horizon of huntingagriculturists of the Middle West, out of
which it is believed the later groups of
the Caddoan family developed on the one
hand, and the Mogollon culture on the
other.

If such a culture, or series of cultures, ancestral
to the far-flung Caddoan speakers and the early
Mogollon peoples ever existed, it would be of the utmost significance in American prehistory. We can examine the problem briefly.
The Georgetown and San Francisco Phases have
been estimated by Haury to have existed from about
700 to 800 and 800 to 900 A.D., respectively. Both are
characterized by non-Puebloan pottery such as San
Francisco Red, Alma Plain, Alma Neck Banded, Alma
Scored, and Alma Punched (Haury 1936a). Haury
(1936b:124–125) has discussed the possible “eastern”
connections as follows:
Still another angle remains which gives
the Mogollon Culture individuality. This
is a number of traits eastern in complexion,
some exclusively so, some being shared
in a limited way by Southwestern groups.
The items which appear most significant
are: equal dependence upon hunting and
agriculture; pit houses with graded side
entrances; storage pits; a low vaulted,
undeformed, brachycephalic physical
type; a painted ware with red decoration
on a neutral brown background; the
association of a red ware and a dark plain
ware; a scoring technique on pottery;
vessel forms; to some extent, the painting
of clay pipes; stone hoes; full-grooved
mauls; large chipped blades; stemmed
drills; and shell gorgets.
47

Alex D. Krieger
Aside from minor variations, the types
found in the Plains area and those
identified with the Hohokam Culture are
characterized by several features in
common: four central roof supports in
earlier houses, the supports increasing
in number with later types; exterior roof
supports, probably forming the main wall
material, placed within the excavation
dug for the house; a side entrance
composed of a covered passage-way,
inclined from the floor. In both areas, the
building was of timber and was covered
with earth. Ordinarily the walls of the pit
in which the dwelling was built were not
used directly for the walls of the house.

in the same general period were oval and semicircular
rather than square (Sayles 1937:Figure 37).
Sayles (1937:84–90) has made such comparisons as these:
The Mogollon house differs from that of
the Hohokam in having a greater depth
below the surface, calling for a longer and
more inclined entrance, sometimes
provided with more than one step. The
passage-way in the Mogollon house is
also usually narrower than that in the
Hohokam. Other differences may be
pointed out…The greatest difference
between the houses of the two cultures
is in their change in form from early to
late. The Hohokam developed from a
square, through a rectangular, to an
elliptical-shape, while the Mogollon
followed the trend from a round, through
a rectangular-shape with rounded
corners, to a rectangle (Haury 1936b:8–
23, 52–63)…it seems more probable that
both types were derived from some
common ancestral type than that either
culture gained its knowledge from the
other. This fundamental relationship
seems also to have been reinforced, as
time went on, by geographical and
cultural contact as shown elsewhere in
this report…

In the Plains area, the firepit was usually
in the center of the floor, as opposed to
that of the Hohokam at the end of the
entrance passage. Also, storage pits were
common in the Plains culture, and, while
they were a feature of the Mogollon
houses, they have not been found with
the Hohokam. Some of the outside pits
identified with the Pioneer Period may
have served originally for storage
purposes, although they appear to have
been primarily for cooking, and later were
filled with trash.
The extent of the distribution of the house
type of the Plains culture is not at present
known. It is found as far to the southeast,
at least, as the Caddoan territory in
Arkansas (Harrington 1920:256–258, 291–
297).

While the present data are insufficient to
attempt any exact correlations between
the Plains area and any contiguous
region, it is interesting to note that there
are close analogies between the House
types as defined by Strong in the Plains
region and those of the Hohokam. These
lie in the early construction, in both
regions, of a deep, square house,
changing, in later times, to a shallow,
rounded one. In the Plains area the early
type seems to be smaller than the later, a
trend in size contrary to the Hohokam,
but paralleling the Mogollon. Also in the
Plains, there are rounded types in the
earlier phases, which again is the case
with the Mogollon series. In the Hohokam
series, the rounded shapes were not in
use. However, in the Plains as in the
Hohokam all the later types were rounded.

Just what may have been the relations
between the Plains cultures, the
Hohokam, and the Mogollon, cannot
definitely be said. The analogies in house
types in all three regions are close, yet
the differences sufficiently marked as to
suggest derivations from some common
source.

We have already noted that a square house plan
with extended entranceway, central prepared clay fire
basin, two or four large center posts, and orientation
on the cardinal directions is typical of the Spiro Focus;
also that in the later McCurtain Focus a similar but
smaller and less carefully made house oriented off the
cardinal directions has been found. Other foci from
both horizons in the “Caddo area” do not reveal such
dwellings, the plan being round and without center posts,

In the Plains region the roof entrance was
sometimes used, but not as consistently
as in the pit-dwellings of the Anasazi area.
48

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

large and without extended entrance in the Alto and
Haley Foci; smaller, and with extended entrance in
Texarkana and Belcher. It is fairly clear that the houses
comparable to those of Upper Republican (Sayles’
“Plains house”) and early Hohokam occur only in the
two most northerly foci—those most exposed to the
open Plains country in both the geographical and cultural senses—of the Aspects here considered. Nor do
such square houses appear anywhere between Upper
Republican and the Hohokam; such a culture as the
Antelope Creek Focus in the Texas Panhandle, which
might be expected to reveal some sort of connection
between Nebraska and southern Arizona, has instead
a small circular pit dwelling comparable to Basket
Maker, a true corn metate, cordmarked pottery and
many Plains-like bone implements. Furthermore, a very
long temporal gap almost certainly separates these
cultures, early Hohokam probably existing in the centuries just after 1 A.D., the Upper Republican probably dating from a pre-Coronado time but extending
some time after Coronado (Wedel 1940).
The Spiro-McCurtain houses, on the other hand,
would quite reasonably seem to be closely connected
with Upper Republican and Nebraskan dwellings in
shape, size, center posts, fireplaces, entranceways, etc.,
as well as in geographical proximity and temporal horizon. Both these areas are furthermore rather obviously
connected with the Mouse Creeks Focus of eastern
Tennessee (Lewis and Kneberg 1941) in house form,
the latter having definitely been dated as post-DeSoto
or post-1542. Thus it seems entirely possible to establish a connection (though this needs investigation and
delineation) between Spiro-McCurtain, upper Republican-Nebraskan, and Mouse Creeks (and perhaps other
southeastern foci) in the matter of square houses with
center posts and extended entranceways—all of these
dating into post-1540 times. Compared to this alignment, Hohokam and Mogollon houses seem indeed
remote both in time and in respect to evolution of house
forms within each area. This is not to say that the resemblances are purely accidental, but if an historical
connection is to be demonstrated it seems to me it will
have to be pursued on a continent-wide basis with chronological considerations. Moreover, the house forms
are but one aspect of material culture in the total background in each case, and the areas mentioned in these
backgrounds are quite radically different.
In short, Gladwin’s postulation that the material
culture of various modern Caddoan speakers of the
Plains and Southeast evolved from a “basic culture”
which is anciently represented in Mogollon, seems almost entirely without archaeological support. There is

also a considerable danger in employing linguistic relationships for such archaeological purposes, for even
among the Caddoan family, the “Southern Caddo”
branch is rather far removed from the others (Weer
1938). If the situation existed as Gladwin has assumed,
it must be shown through more conclusive archaeological data. But as he himself has recently recognized
(Gladwin 1942:9) the term “Caddoan Root” was an
unfortunate one because of its unwarranted ethnic implications. Such far-reaching reconstructions as those
of Weer (1938:119–122), based upon the “Caddoan
Root” concept, seem to me untenable.
Haury has made the observation that the farther
back one goes in both Mogollon and Hohokam history,
the more alike they become and the more both become like Archaic cultures in southern Mexico.28 This
apparently applies to ceramic tradition as well as other
material traits. Thus it appears likely that attempts to
account for the Mogollon and Hohokam may in the
future take quite a different tack from the “Plains” and
“Caddo” approaches. Certainly the time element would
be more in agreement on the Mexican side than on the
Plains and Southeast. Certainly, too, ceramic problems
promise to yield more specific results in that direction.
Regarding the “Caddo area” the closest similarity apparent to me is with the Sanders Focus, but according
to present researches this must have existed at least
seven centuries after Mogollon.
Turning from this we may now inquire into the
age of residence of the known Caddoan tribes and linguistic groups in the territories which they occupied
upon discovery. All archaeological evidence points to
the same conclusion: the Arikara, Pawnee, Wichita,
and Southern or “Red River Caddo” branches were all
relatively recent occupants of their respective territories, probably in no case preceding 1540 A.D.
A considerable amount of sound work has been
done on the Pawnee, largely through the efforts of
Strong, Bell, Hill, and Wedel. Wedel (1936:102), the
outstanding authority on the whole Plains province, has
made such a statement as the following:
These (Pawnee) traits were acquired
largely during the residence of the tribe
in the old Caddoan habitat on the lower
Mississippi and adjacent areas to the
west. They sprang from the same basic
sub-pattern as did the Iroquois,
Muskhogean, and related cultures of the
Eastern Woodland. As Sapir has
suggested on linguistic grounds, the
early connections appear to have been
especially close between Pawnee and
49

Alex D. Krieger
Iroquoian peoples. Kroeber also implies
this in pointing out the distribution of
the matrilineate in the Eastern
Woodlands (Iroquoian-Muskhogean)
and in the Plains (Pawnee-Hidatsa-Crow).

the trade contacts with Caucasians beginning by 1680
or 1690 A.D. Some features of this horizon developed
from the Gibson Aspect, especially in ceramics. A like
situation may be seen in the Pawnee occupation of the
central Plains where there are some indications of evolution from the preceding Upper Republican and Nebraskan Aspects, but withal the Pawnee material has
a definite character of its own (Wedel 1940). Wedel
(1936:11) states that “The earliest reference to the
Pawnee, beyond the disputed Coronado narratives, is
by the Jesuit priest, Marquette…On his map…prepared
in 1673.”
An outstanding trait of Pawnee culture is the
round “earth lodge” with central fireplace and covered
entranceway directed east, southeast, or south (Wedel
1936:Figures 2–4). Regarding center posts, “The Pawnee, although they sometimes used as many as eight in
their largest lodges, never referred to more than four
in their ceremonies. It is probable, therefore, that the
ancestral earth lodge had a four-post central support”
(Linton 1924:248). The Mandan, Arikara, and Hidatsa
also consistently used four central posts, and it is possible that the Pawnee either broke away from the conventional number (Wedel 1936:98) or adopted the earth
lodge at such a late time that the number of center
posts had not become fixed (Linton 1924:248). Although
the four-post idea was used in prehistoric square houses,
the square plan has not been found in historic times.
The four posts, however, continue into the historic period in the earth lodge of round plan, as among the
Mandan.
Be this as it may, there is little to support an origin for these houses in the southern Caddo area, as
both Wedel and Linton have suggested; they also suggest a link with the Southeastern area east of the Mississippi, especially with Muskhogean tribes. The latter
seems more promising, for west of the Mississippi the
very items used for comparisons are there at least as
late as in the Pawnee area. Aside from houses there is
very little indeed which may be held to connect Pawnee and the southern Caddo of Fulton Aspect.30
If Pawnee culture origins, or the people themselves, are to be traced elsewhere, the same is true of
southern Caddo. No doubt there is some significance
in the late appearance of all branches of the Caddo
family in their historic territories, but we get nowhere
in vaguely bringing them out of the “Southeast” or the
“lower Mississippi” without more substantial archaeological evidence.
The Wichita branch of the family, like the Pawnee and southern Caddo, seems also to have appeared
in the southern Plains at a late time, in all probability

I cannot think of any real archaeological evidence
in support of a former “residence” of the Pawnee in
an “old Caddoan habitat” on or anywhere near the
lower Mississippi or in any regions west of it. Wedel
apparently bases this contention largely upon the square
house found by Harrington in southwestern Arkansas
and called by him “Caddoan.” But these generalizations and the supposition of a long residence by the
Southern Caddoans in their historic territory can now, I
believe, be refuted.
A few comparisons between central Plains and
the “Caddo area” may be made in specific culture context, with the warning that these are merely indicative
of a general situation which demands considerably more
attention. For example, such features as square houses
with central fireplace, four center posts, and extended
entranceway of posts; many bone implements including scapula hoes; flexed burials in small tumuli; stone
elbow pipes; copper-covered wooden ear spools; use
of conch shell for ornaments, etc., have been noted as
typical for the upper Republican and Nebraskan Aspects (Wedel 1940:310–312). The same or very similar traits can be noted for the Spiro Focus, and in some
measure for the Sanders. Ceramic complexes are almost totally different in the two regions. They all presumably date from some time before 1540 A.D. until
some time after, the Spiro and Sanders Foci then receiving the Southern Cult complex about 1600 A.D. or
slightly before. Moreover, Upper Republican-Nebraskan and Spiro-Sanders existed in a rather similar environment of wooded valleys and rolling plains, with bison economically important in both cases: a marginal
position between the Great Plains and the eastern forests. The situation is, after all, about what one would
expect on the basis of physiography. It illustrates
contemporaneity and some degree of common possession of culture traits, but not necessarily culture
movement or tribal migration in any particular direction.29
But we are speaking of a horizon which preceded the latest or protohistoric-historic in both areas.
Can the same be said for the known Caddoan speaking tribes in both cases?
According to the interpretation advanced here,
most of the Fulton Aspect is representative of southern Caddoan groups in a period following 1600 A.D.,
50

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

well after 1540 A.D. The Henrietta Focus could logically be regarded as the prehistoric representation of
Wichita tribes, for the culture occupies about the same
territory in Texas as was claimed by historic Wichita
or their relatives the Taovaya, Kichai, etc. The Spanish Fort Focus in all probability represents protohistoric
and Wichita-speaking tribes (see Figures 1 and 4).
Between Henrietta, Spanish Fort Focus, and
Pawnee there appear to have been somewhat more
traits in common than between any of these and the
southern Caddo. Small triangular arrow points, both
unnotched and side-notched; flexed burials in small
round pits; numerous bison bone tools including hoes,
knives, chisels, and notched ribs; stone pipes; longitudinally grooved sandstone “shaft straighteners;”
grooved mauls; and probably round house plans may
be mentioned, but the presence or absence of an extended entranceway in Wichita houses is an unknown
factor, unless it has been found in Oklahoma. Like the
Pawnee, the Wichita tribes were horse riders and depended heavily upon the bison as well as on agriculture. Linguistically, Wichita and Pawnee were closer
than either with southern Caddo, the latter the most
divergent branch of the family (Weer 1938).
In the central Plains the Pawnee horizon was
preceded by Upper Republican, a developed culture
which entered the Plains from the east full blown, i.e.,
without any ancestral civilization in the same region
(Wedel 1940:319–320). In the south, Fulton Aspect was
likewise preceded by Gibson, which had no apparent
ancestral culture within the territory north and west of
the Red River. In the Red River valley it appears to
have been co-existent with the last phases of Coles
Creek and thus ties in with the lower Mississippi sequence of Ford (1936) and Ford and Willey (1941).
The Gibson Aspect, especially in its Gahagan Focus,
also gives evidence of affiliation with the Marksville
and Hopewellian civilization in non-ceramic features.
In all of this, a search for the origin of Pawnee, southern Caddo, and Wichita is a complex problem with no
easy solution. Fundamentals of internal culture change,
acculturation, movement, trade, borrowing, and adaptation, and their rates and degrees of procedure are at
issue. Possibly oral traditions will prove to be of value
in tracing origins or actual movements, but as yet these
have not proved tangible enough in most cases to aid
much in reconstructing the tribal histories.
Wedel (1936:7–23) has gone exhaustively into
both the oral traditions and the documentary history of
the Pawnee divisions and traced a number of movements of these tribes within the central Plains area.
However, the various myths as to their once coming

from outside this region involve both the southwestern
and southeastern parts of the United States. Both of
these possibilities break down in the face of archaeological information.
Swanton (1942:28–29) has summarized the situation as follows:
The several narratives agree in one
important item, in locating the point of
origin, or emergence, of the Caddo in the
eastern part of the territories, and in
representing their movements as from
east to west…Wichita traditions seem to
agree with those of the Caddo and the
majority of the Pawnee in pointing to a
movement from the east and north rather
than the south and west (Gatschet
1891:249–252). This conclusion would be
further supported if the linguistic
relationship affirmed to exist between
Caddoan and Iroquoian languages is
borne out by future investigation. In the
meantime we must wait upon the linguists
and archaeologists.

There is no archaeological support for the tradition that calls for the Caddoan people having “emerged”
from a place somewhere near the mouth of the Red
River (Weer 1938:117–118). Of course the general fact
that the Gibson and Fulton Aspects are Mississippian
points toward eastern origins. The Fulton covers somewhat the same territory as the Gibson, except that its
total distribution before the historic contacts began was
considerably smaller; after the contacts Fulton Aspect
trade pottery spread far to the west across central
Texas, while the peoples themselves appear to have
spread quite rapidly eastward—i.e., back in the direction from which they supposedly came some time before. The evidence for such a movement eastward from
the Red River and its tributaries lies in the distribution
of Glendora Focus sites (see Figure 1). The
Natchitoches site (Walker 1935), the surface material
at the Crooks site (Ford and Willey 1940), Glendora
and Keno in northeastern Louisiana (Moore 1909), and
the surface material at Greer and Douglas on the lower
Arkansas River (Moore 1908) provide examples of
historic occupation by Caddoan tribes in a broad area
fanning out to the southeast, east, and northeast toward the Mississippi and down the Red River to the
territories of Natchez, Tunica, and Quapaw. Between
the Red River valley and this final eastern front there
appears to be no prehistoric sites which can be referred to Fulton Aspect exclusive of the Glendora Fo51

horizons are concerned, such evidence was very slight
in the Gibson Aspect, being practically confined to the
Alto Focus neck banded pottery; but in the Fulton Aspect neck banding became fairly common in several
foci, while on the New Mexico side certain surface
treatments and a bowl shape may have been acquired
from the Fulton Aspect.
It is interesting to note that by 1600 A.D. or perhaps slightly earlier, agricultural practices were carried on over a continuous area from the Puebloan
peoples across the southern Plains to the Mississippi
and on to the Atlantic. There was no non-agricultural
corridor separating West from East, as Wissler
(1938:Figure 3) and others have assumed. Horticulture was of course confined to certain suitable river
valleys and there must have been some extensive dry
areas in this great expanse which precluded it; again,
with the coming of the horse horticulture must have
been given up in such areas as the Texas Panhandle,
but on these matters we have insufficient data for conclusions. We can, however, be reasonably sure that
agriculture was combined with hunting in all the general region from the Mogollon culture through eastern
New Mexico, the Texas Panhandle, north Texas and
Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska, and thence into the
Eastern Woodlands and the Southeast. The Mogollon,
Antelope Creek, Henrietta, Upper Republican, and
probably other cultures in Oklahoma and Kansas as
yet undefined, all supply evidence of agriculture in the
form of stone or bone hoes, metates for corn grinding
(as opposed to, or in addition to, simple seed grinding
slabs), occasional carbonized corn cobs, and location
of more or less permanent villages on arable terraces.
The bones of bison and other animals are also numerous in these cultures, many artifacts were made from
bison and other bone. In the Henrietta Focus, at least,
fish bones also occur in the sites—a non-Plains feature which may be connected with the similarity of
Henrietta pottery to that of the St. Francis complex.
Farther east in the Gibson and Fulton Aspects,
bison bones are relatively few and not used for implements except for the hoes in Sanders and Spiro Foci;
deer, fish, and turkey bones are very numerous; and
metates for corn grinding with back-and-forth manos
are completely lacking. It may be rather safely assumed,
I think, that the wooden mortar and pestle was applied
to corn grinding in these Aspects, though we have only
the historic records to show the presence of this device. The simple, unshaped flat stones and rounded
stones used as mullers throughout these Aspects have
been called “metates” and “manos” but they seem no
more connected with corn than similar stones over vast

cus; therefore in our present knowledge a sudden burst
eastward at about the time of European contact in the
last years of the seventeenth century is indicated. Possibly this was the direct result of pressure from the
Plains bison hunters who had acquired the horse and
begun their warlike activities. Weer (1938:118) postulates a prehistoric spread of Caddoans from Red River
eastward to “the west bank of the Mississippi,” with a
subsequent retreat northwestward “up the Red River
where they were found by the French.”
Archaeologically, only the late eastward spread is discernible.
To summarize, the present evidence is that there
were contacts and some mutual influences between
early Mogollon and Hohokam. Connections between
either of these and the Plains region cannot be placed
on a definite basis because of the considerable time
difference which evidently separated them from Upper Republican. The latter was a developed culture
when it spread up the river valleys, presumably from
the central Mississippi valley region, at some unknown
time preceding Coronado. Upper Republican was succeeded by protohistoric and historic Pawnee. Farther
to the south in eastern Oklahoma, west central Arkansas, and one point in east Texas just south of the Red
River, the Spiro and Sanders Foci were roughly contemporaneous with Upper Republican, somewhat related to it in non-ceramic features, and were followed
by Fulton Aspect or southern Caddoan culture. Thus
Pawnee and identifiable Caddoan were also approximately contemporaneous in both protohistoric and historic times, were probably in contact, and possessed a
very few traits in common. The archaeological remains
of Wichita speaking tribes occupy about the same temporal position as Pawnee and Fulton Aspect Caddo,
and these remains, as well as the linguistic relationship
and a relatively mobile Plains life due to bison hunting
and the horse, point to a rather close affinity between
these two branches of the Caddoan family. The
Henrietta Focus, likely representing prehistoric ancestral Wichita culture, possesses a rough shell-tempered
pottery very remindful of St. Francis rough ware in the
central Mississippi basin, possibly pointing to a former
homeland of Wichita peoples in this region. However,
the Spanish Fork Focus or historic Wichita complex
possesses a polished bone-tempered ware of unknown
origin.
After the Antelope Creek Focus had passed from
existence, perhaps about 1500 A.D., a number of contacts between the Pueblo area in late Pueblo IV or
Glaze III and IV (and V?) and the Gibson and Fulton
Aspects are discernible. As far as these Mississippian
52

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

pian cultures “derived mainly” from such a
Hopewellian-Marksville base, but at any rate the elements from one which survived and influenced the other
were of considerable weight.
The great and rich Hopewellian manifestations
cannot be reviewed here, but the various lists of traits
compounded by such authors as Shetrone (1936), Cole
and Deuel (1937:222), Greenman (1936), Ford and
Willey (1940:139), Setzler (1940), and Griffin (1941),
probably give a fair picture of the most common diagnostic specimens and practices. From these accounts,
I believe the items listed in Table 7 may be said to have
carried over from Hopewellian-Marksville into the
Gibson Aspect.
This list is probably not exhaustive but it serves
to indicate the scope of carryover from the Hopewellian
into the Mississippian civilization in this part of the continent, and the lateness of this mixture. Sanders and
Alto Foci include a small proportion of these traits;
Sanders principally the various shell and pearl beads;
conch shell dippers; tapered greenstone celts; cranial
deformation; pottery vessels and other artifacts in
graves; extended position of burials; and copper covering of ear spools; Alto in small conical tumuli (use
unknown); greenstone celts; quartz crystals (loose in
deposit); and knives, including the “Copena” form which
may belong to Hopewellian and is found in all the other
foci. The Sanders burials appear to have been made in
middens rather than constructed tumuli, but notes are
so far inadequate to judge this point. Nothing is known
of Alto Focus burials or their association with tumuli,
or accompanying artifacts.
Some important Hopewellian traits which have
not been found to continue into the Gibson Aspect horizon are: log tombs and other log structures in connection with burial tumuli; burial of decapitated skulls; secondary or bundle burials; “killing” or ceremonial breakage of grave goods; earth wall enclosures around mound
groups; axes, gouges, or adzes of copper; “conjoined
tubes” of copper; platform pipes of stone, with or without effigy bowls; copper bracelets; galena beads; plummet stones; boat stones31; human figurines of pottery;
large projectile points of ovate outline with notches and
small base, and perhaps other projectiles. One of the
most obvious Hopewellian-Marksville traits, or group
of traits, that fail to enter this horizon, lies in the pottery
complex, including all manner of rocker and dentate
stamping, bird motifs outlined by heavy grooves, vessel shapes which include the typical “collared” rim with
hatched and cross-hatched lines, etc.
In all these matters Spiro Focus data is offered
with the greatest reservation and full expectation that

expanses of America, in the non-agricultural Great
Basin and Plateau, in pre-agricultural Southwestern
horizons, etc.
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE
EASTERN UNITED STATES
In the section on Chronological Position of the
Gibson Aspect, note was made of the apparent survival of several Hopewellian traits in the Gibson Aspect foci which center in the Red River valley; namely,
the Haley and Gahagan. It was also noted that both
the Gibson and Fulton Aspects belong to the Mississippian “Pattern,” principally through their ceramics, pipes,
abundance of ceramic grave goods, intensive agriculture, rectangular flat-topped tumuli, possession of arrow points, etc. These matters were mentioned primarily for purposes of comparative dating, but to understand more fully the position of these Aspects in the
eastern scheme, it will be necessary to develop these
and other matters in more detail. Ford and Willey
(1940:143) provide a statement which will serve as a
lead:
It can now be demonstrated that in the
Lower Mississippi Valley the later cultural
stages, Troyville, Coles Creek, Caddoan,
and the west coast of Florida
developments, Weeden Island, and Safety
Harbor, derived mainly from the cultural
base provided by the Marksville stage.
Intensive investigations in the central part
of the Mississippi Valley will very
probably show that the widespread
Middle Mississippi cultures were
developing at the same time, principally
from Hopewellian. One result to be
expected from this postulated
phenomenon is that traits directly
comparable with those of Hopewellian will
appear sporadically in peripheral
Mississippian cultures and in the
adjacent Woodland cultures at dates very
near the beginning of the historic period.

Although these authors hold that the Marksville
stage in the southern states existed at an earlier time
than classic Hopewellian in the Ohio valley and the
Florida regions, Hopewellian and Marksville possess
so many features in common that for the purposes of
the present paper we can consider them as a common
base out of which Mississippian cultures took shape.
One might question their statement that the Mississip53

it will some day be corrected wherever I may have
erred. Some Hopewellian elements should perhaps be
added, and possibly some which I have included do not
actually associate with the Spiro, but the list is at least
indicative.
Mississippian features which appear in the Gibson
Aspect but which do not seem to derive from
Hopewellian include the following: rectangular and
square flat-topped tumuli (in some of which graves were
made); polished pottery with engraved designs in which
pigment were impressed; a variety of bowl, bottle, and
jar forms not made previously; scoring, fingernail gouging, and punctating of vessel bodies below decoration
zone; filming of complete vessel with red ochre (some
zoned or patterned filming known in Marksville); all
pipe forms, including the stone and effigy non-platform
styles, stone T-shaped pipes, long-stemmed pottery
pipes with distal projection, and long-stemmed elbow
form shown for Sanders Focus; true arrow points in
every focus; probably all the specific house plans shown
in Figure 2, although rectangular plans are said to occur in Hopewellian; spatulate celts or “spuds”; and small
rectangular, highly polished flat celts. The bison bone
hoes of Spiro and Sanders are also distinctly not
Hopewellian. The technological bases for working in
copper and conch shell already existed in Hopewellian
and continued in strength into the Spiro Focus, where,
however, they were applied to the manufacture of the
particular whole shells, gorgets, and repoussé copper
plaques of the Southern Cult.
The problems of culture sequence and trait survival in this region are complicated by the position of
the Coles Creek horizon in the Lower Mississippi valley. No very specific account of what Coles Creek
really is, or just what traits distinguish it, has been published. Ford (1936:172–218) has given the fullest account, but the pottery type terminology therein is now
obsolete. In spite of this, it seems clear that Coles Creek

Remarks

is identified by a number of distinct ceramic styles that
existed after Marksville had disappeared, the Troyville
period marking transitions from Marksville to Coles
Creek. Still later, probably sometime between about
1500 and 1600 A.D., the terminal existence of Coles
Creek coincided in part with the Gibson Aspect.
The problem, then, is to determine whether the
Hopewellian-Marksville traits which appear in Table 7
continued to exist throughout the Coles Creek culture
and on into the Gibson Aspect, or whether the Coles
Creek was somewhat apart from this other sequence,
but existing alongside it. It seems strange indeed that
some Marksville-Gibson similarities are stronger than
those of either with Coles Creek, which presumably
came between them in time and covered much the
same territory as Marksville. Comparisons must, however, be rather confined to pottery for very little is on
record of Coles Creek burial methods, house forms,
and other traits. This much seems clear: there were
major stylistic differences between Marksville, Coles
Creek, and Gibson Aspect in vessel shapes and decoration; they all continue a clay-grit temper tradition;
and in motif there are more similarities between
Marksville Incised designs and those of the very late
Glendora and Natchez complexes than there are between Coles Creek and Marksville, and between Coles
Creek and the Gibson Aspect. It is difficult to explain
this skip over Coles Creek with the evidence at hand.32
Of widespread significance is the appearance
of true arrow points in the Coles Creek horizon, whereas
they did not exist in Marksville-Hopewellian or any
earlier horizon in the Eastern states. The Coles Creek
styles closely resemble Alba Barbed, Hayes Barbed,
and perhaps others of the Gibson Aspect. In the later
Fulton Aspect arrow point styles changed abruptly from
the Gibson (see Figure 3), and it is interesting that almost none of the styles from either Aspect are comparable to the small triangular points which are usually
55

Alex D. Krieger

taken as typical of Mississippian cultures. Possible exceptions may be seen in the triangular notched points
of Gahagan and Spiro, but even these can be distinguished from the Mississippian styles (see Cole and
Deuel 1937:Plate IV, type 4).
The Coles Creek culture also includes a fairly
common occurrence of flat-topped tumuli, decidedly
of a square plan both at the base and at the summit,
and these are sometimes arranged about a square or
open court (Ford 1936:173–174, 193–203 briefly describes several such sites). Small conical tumuli occur
along with these but there is little information on their
use. In the Gibson Aspect there are instances of both
square and rectangular flat-topped tumuli.
In one case only, so far as I am aware, have
graves been found which can be referred to the Coles
Creek culture. This is at the Crenshaw site on the Red
River in southwestern Arkansas, where Lemley
(1936:19–21) found great rectangular grave pits under
Mounds B and D. The graves under these tumuli (B,
circular; D, irregular oval) contained rows of extended
skeletons and pottery of three Coles Creek types. Identical graves made later in the tumulus bulks contained
Haley Focus types. Crenshaw also includes one large,
square, flat-topped structure (Mound C) and a similar
but rectangular structure (Mound A); another oval
(Mound F) and another circular heap (Mound E), but
none except B and D have been explored. No suggestion of a court or other arrangement may be seen in
the placement of these eminences (Moore 1912:Figure 122).
Because of its square tumuli, court arrangement,
its non-Marksville-Troyville-Hopewellian pottery, and
presumably its possession of arrow points, the Coles
Creek culture has been included in an “early Middle
Mississippi” period or stage by Griffin (n.d.) or the
“Temple Mound I stage” of Ford and Willey (1941:344–
352).
The Gibson Aspect, because of its ceramic and
other differences from Coles Creek, might be supposed
to represent a later period. Some of its pottery types,
such as Hardy and Davis Incised of Alto Focus, appear to be simplified descendants of Coles Creek Incised, and the types Crockett Curvilinear Incised and
“Keota Curvilinear Incised” of Alto and Spiro Foci
would likewise appear to be simplified relatives or descendants of French Fork Incised and Weeden Island
Incised of the coeval Coles Creek and Weeden Island
II periods. Moreover, we have the stratigraphic superimposition of Haley Focus graves over Coles Creek
graves at Crenshaw. Nonetheless, the Spiro, Haley,
Gahagan, and Alto Foci all have yielded a small num-

ber of intrusive specimens (usually sherds) of Coles
Creek Incised, Coles Creek Plain, Rhinehart Punctated,
and perhaps Chevalier Stamped of the same period.
For this reason, I believe that Coles Creek and Gibson
Aspect were at least in part contemporaneous, but the
latter continued in existence for some time after the
former disappeared as a distinct entity. The date of
this disappearance has been estimated by Ford and
Willey (1941:346) at about 1550 A.D. The Gibson Aspect must then have continued until about 1600 A.D.,
when its northern foci were affected by the Southern
Cult phenomenon.
Certainly a major distinction between Coles
Creek and Gibson exists in the widespread use of engraved pottery decoration in the latter. This technique
of cutting through a hard, polished surface after the
vessel was fired (and after red film was applied, where
this occurs), although new at this time in the Southeast,
was integrated with Gibson Aspect ceramics to the
point of identical paste and temper with other types in
each focus. In the Spiro and Haley Foci engraved designs involving scrolls are similar to those executed by
incising, but the two techniques are found on vessels
showing distinct ranges of shape. Some incised designs in these foci, moreover, are remindful of those
found in the types French Fork Incised of Coles Creek
and Weeden Island Incised (Willey and Woodbury 1942)
of Weeden Island II in northwestern Florida. Thus the
Spiro and Haley engraved scrolls suggest some degree of imitation of somewhat different vessels.
In the Moundville culture, engraving was applied
to stone palettes and conch shells, and to one principal
vessel form: a small-mouthed, vertical-neck jar. Decorative motifs tend strongly toward ceremonial figures
such as winged serpents, demons, birds, etc. of the
Southern Cult (see Moore 1905:Figures 8, 20–21, 30,
37, 39, 53, 84, 112, 114, and 117; Webb and DeJarnette
1942:Plates 67-1, 119, 122-2, 267-2, 268). The Bessemer site in Alabama (DeJarnette and Wimberly 1941)
is related to Moundville and reveals engraved pottery
along with some other Southeastern wares. Various
scroll-like designs consisting of closely spaced parallel
lines and peculiar circular depressed areas also characterize Moundville pottery engraving.
Comparing Moundville with the Gibson Aspect
(especially Spiro Focus), it is quite evident that Cult
motifs dominate in Moundville pottery engraving, and
that there is no co-existent or ancestral incised pottery
in the same area which can be compared to the engraved. The latter is, however, associated with the principle of shell tempering. In the Gibson Aspect, no Cult
motifs whatsoever appear on pottery (unless as trade
56

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

pieces), although they are engraved on conch shells
and gorgets. The stone palettes of Moundville culture
seemingly do not occur to the west. Within the Gibson
Aspect engraved designs may be divided into (1) the
Spiro and Haley scroll motifs which tie in with incised
motifs of “Keota,” Crockett, French Fork, and Weeden
Island Incised, and (2) the concentric circles, semicircles, quarter-circles and blocks of parallel lines found
in Holly Fine Engraved of Alto and Gahagan, which
have no known incised relatives but may be locally
conventionalized relatives of Spiro-Haley engraving.
Moundville engraved work thus appears as an
aberrant complex in the area east of the lower Mississippi and shows no direct relationship to the Weeden
Island II culture to the south of it on the Gulf Coast.
But through the Spiro Focus a thin line of continuous
ceramic development may be traced backward through
Coles Creek to Weeden Island II. The latter in turn
owe some of their properties to a Hopewellian base.
The history of these influences is far from clear
as yet, and I do not wish to claim that the above observations are proved facts—only that they suggest points
of attack for the future.
Through Spiro Focus the Gibson Aspect also
connects with Dallas Focus of eastern Tennessee
(Lewis and Kneberg 1941) and Etowah, Georgia
(Moorehead 1932) in possession of Southern Cult elements. Dallas and Etowah, unlike Moundville, evidently
do not include engraved decoration in their resident
potteries, instead continuing the respective regional
developments. The Spiro Focus house type (see Figure 2) has a very close relative in the Mouse Creek
Focus of eastern Tennessee (Lewis and Kneberg 1941),
a culture only slightly differentiated from Dallas and
overlapping it in time.
Near the mouth of the Ohio the Kincaid and
Angell sites also bear the Southern Cult material (Ford
and Willey 1941:358). A thorough study of this phenomenon would doubtlessly reveal its presence over a
very great expanse in the eastern states, with a center
perhaps in Tennessee.
Throughout most of its distribution area the Southern Cult is placed in the Late Middle Mississippi or
“Temple Mound II” stage because of its association
with shell-tempered pottery and very abundant grave
goods (Ford and Willey 1941:357–358). In the Spiro
and Sanders Foci, however, no shell temper appears.
The Gibson Aspect as a whole agrees much better
with Early Middle Mississippi or “Temple Mound I,”
and this, together with its lack of shell tempering, places
it in this period in spite of its possession of the Southern
Cult in the northern foci. This correlation does not nec-

essarily demand a temporal difference, for shell tempering rather clearly reached the “Caddo area” somewhat after its general dispersion east of the Mississippi, and the Gibson Aspect, existing in a marginal
position, may well have continued in an Early Middle
Mississippian stage after Late Middle Mississippi had
begun to develop to the east of the river or even in its
central basin.
The appearance of the engraving technique in
the Gibson Aspect and Moundville cultures, whether
or not it was associated with the Southern Cult, must
have occurred at approximately the same time, or according to present estimates at some time between 1500
and 1600 A.D. A possible explanation for its origin will
be offered in the next section.
Turning to the Fulton Aspect, we have a series
of seven or eight foci which can be roughly equated
with Late Middle Mississippi or “Temple Mound II”
through the employment of shell tempering in some
foci: Texarkana, McCurtain, Belcher, and Glendora.
This tempering principle probably failed to reach the
Titus, Frankston, and Bossier Foci because it was just
beginning to spread west and south from the Red River
bend when historic disruptions set in. As stated previously, shell was not used to any great extent in any of
the prehistoric foci except Texarkana and McCurtain,
where it became popular in Nash Neck Banded and
some engraved types but not in others. Vessels without any visible temper were made alongside those with
shell in these foci, both ideas being confined to fine,
polished, and engraved ware, while clay-grit (and occasionally bone) continued in rough “utility” vessels until
historic times in all foci.33
The most outstanding facts about Fulton Aspect
are (1) the complete or nearly complete disappearance
of practically every Gibson trait indicative of derivation from the Hopewellian-Marksville civilization, except for a variety of shell beads; (2) disappearance of
Southern Cult elements before the Fulton came into
existence; (3) virtual abandonment of tumulus building,
attended by use of such elevations built by previous
peoples; (4) continuation of many ceramic traits from
Gibson Aspect, including the common use of engraving, but with altered motifs and changes in most vessel
forms. These changes in form are not radical but apply
chiefly to rim-body proportions and curvature, bases,
bottle neck shapes, and the like.
On the whole, such Fulton Aspect pottery as that
from the Titus, Bossier, and Frankston Foci tends to be
simpler than that of the Gibson in designs and shapes;
very rude incising and brushing or scoring become common in place of polished-over incised scrolls. All scrolls
57

Alex D. Krieger

in the Fulton are engraved, the incised ones disappearing with the close of the Gibson period. Quadration of
bodies and rims, as well as designs, is found in varying
frequency in the different foci, except Frankston, where
none of these occur; nor do red filming and shell temper appear in this focus.
Curiously, the Frankston is the only focus in this
horizon in which functional handles occur on jars, a
trait which is consistently associated with shell temper
almost throughout the Late Middle Mississippi Phase.
These are of loop and strap form and probably always
two in number. Very small conventionalized lugs and
handles, four in number, occur on Titus Focus jars but
these are more ornamental than functional; this focus
is likewise without shell temper, except for occasional
Texarkana Focus intrusions.
Although broadly agreeing with a Late Middle
Mississippi horizon, the Fulton Aspect actually shows
little specific relationship to such Mississippian cultures
as Fort Walton (Willey and Woodbury 1942), Mouse
Creek Focus (Lewis and Kneberg 1941), Aztalan and
Cahokia of the Monk’s Mound Aspect, Fort Ancient,
Trappist, Tennessee-Cumberland, and Oneota (see
Cole 1943 and Lewis 1943 for recent summaries). For
example, incised, polished-over scrolls on Aztalan vessels (Barrett 1933:Plates 90-1, 91-1 to 91-6, and 92-1
to 92-2) are not a little like those in Ripley Engraved of
Titus Focus and Taylor Engraved of Titus and Belcher.
Ripley Engraved scroll motifs are invariably repeated
four times, those of Taylor Engraved from four to
twelve times, while those from Aztalan, to judge from
the illustrations, repeat considerably more than four
times. Some Aztalan bowls of shell-tempered ware,
both plain and decorated (Barrett 1933:Plates 79–82,
90-1, 96, 100a-right four and 100b-right four), agree
very closely in rim and body shape with the most common bowl form included in Taylor Engraved, and a less
common form in Simms Engraved of Texarkana Focus. An Aztalan bottle with long, gracefully flaring neck
(Barrett 1933:Plate 86-1) is strikingly like a bottle form
included in Ripley Engraved. Contrary to Fulton Aspect, Aztalan pottery of the shell-tempered Mississippian ware is largely “undecorated in any way” and
very few specimens bear a red film (Barrett 1933:326).
Most of the copper artifacts found at Aztalan
appear to be of extraneous origin, while copper-covered ear spools are more common and probably belong to the Mississippian complex there (Barrett
1933:344–346). In general, Fulton Aspect agrees with
other Mississippian cultures in a dearth of copper work
in comparison with preceding cultures.
On the other hand, Fulton Aspect contrasts

strongly with other cultures of this horizon in its almost
complete lack of earthworks. There is no evidence
whatsoever of mound groups, walls, enclosures, moats,
stockades, and the like. Tumulus building of any kind
was in such decline that the Aspect can be regarded
as essentially without this trait. Projectile points, with
the exception of two types, Talco Triangular and Maud
Triangular (see Figure 3) have small pointed stems, but
even the two triangular types are easily distinguished
from typical Mississippian points. Pipes are all of elbow form and show various specialized forms in the
foci.
From what little is known of house plans,
Texarkana and Belcher possess small round houses
with extended entranceways; McCurtain dwellings are
smaller representatives of the Spiro Focus square and
rectangular houses with extended entranceways. Specific connections with eastern or Southeastern structures are not obvious, though possibly the general idea
of round and square plans combined with entranceways
will sometime prove to have more concrete significance
in relation to Plains and eastern cultures. The only cases
yet reported of the use of wall trenches are from Gibson
Aspect sites: a few short sections of trench in the walls
of some Alto Focus (Davis site) round houses; the preBelcher Focus rectangular house with wall trenches
and entranceway (Webb 1940:Plate 11); and one house
at the Norman site, Oklahoma (Finkelstein 1940:Figure 12).
The main point to be stressed is that, if, as has
been argued herein, the horizon referred to as Fulton
Aspect did not appear until about 1600 A.D., it represents a very brief interval in Southeastern prehistory;
and aside from some notable ceramic developments,
chiefly in the Belcher, Texarkana, and Glendora Foci,
the Aspect as a whole was but a poor sequel to the
Gibson.
The interpretation of Gibson Aspect as ancestral Caddoan is problematic in spite of the fact that
DeSoto evidently found Caddoan-speaking tribes in the
Red River region and eastern Texas. If we restrict the
positive identification of Caddoan peoples to the Fulton
Aspect, a prehistoric occupancy of less than a century
before French explorations is indicated. This is in essential agreement with a similarly brief prehistoric residence of Pawnee in the central Plains, and of such
nations as Natchez, Creek, Tunica, Choctaw,
Chickasaw, Cherokee, etc. in the Southeast. This is
not to say that all these peoples suddenly entered their
historic territories at about the same time. But from
the viewpoint of archaeology the historic complexes
attributable to the known tribes dissolve into notably
58

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

different complexes just beyond the threshold of Caucasian contacts in the late 17th and early 18th centuries
(see Lewis 1943:310–311; Collins 1932). Swanton
(1911:186) has spoken of “the great Muskhogean immigration”—a term which might equally apply to the
Caddoan branches.
In the Fulton Aspect, Glendora Focus pottery
types, although probably rooted in those of Titus and
Belcher Foci, are on the whole distinct enough so that
the protohistoric-historic complex has a character of
its own. In like manner, historic Natchez pottery is rather
readily distinguished from that of the immediately preceding Plaquemine complex (Quimby 1942). Fulton is
preceded by Gibson Aspect, and Plaquemine by Coles
Creek. Though but a century or less separates Gibson
and Coles Creek from the Caucasian period, differences are so strong that tribal identification is precarious. Similarly, Pawnee in the Plains is preceded by
Upper Republican, which may or may not be ancestral
Pawnee.
Numerous social and ceremonial traits of the
Natchez (see Swanton 1911:100–186) have suggested
Middle American origins for either the peoples or some
of their practices. The well known Pawnee Sacrifice
to the Morning Star has also suggested Mexican origin
to several writers. Linton (1926) summarizes the features of this ceremony and divides them into three
groups: traits that are natural to or inherent in Pawnee
star ritualism; others such as cardiac sacrifice and impersonation of deities which may have come to the
Pawnee from the Puebloans; and those such as use of
a frame for torture of captives, which may have
reached them by way of the lower Mississippi valley.
Two centers of origin in the Mexican area are postulated: one in the Highlands, from which traits may have
reached the Pawnee by way of the Puebloan Southwest, and one on the east coast, from which traits could
have been diffused into the lower Mississippi valley
and thence through the southern Caddoan Hasinai tribes
(who also used a torture rack, Swanton 1942:188–189)
to the Pawnee. The Aztec are fairly ruled out as a
source, however, for they themselves seem to have
borrowed the scaffold sacrifice from some other tribe
at about 1506 A.D. (Linton 1926:465).
Swanton (1942:234–239) has summarized a
number of differences and similarities between the historic Caddoan and various Southeastern tribes. That
some Caddo and Natchez were in close contact is
borne out both by their social customs and the archaeological evidence as seen in the Glendora Focus and
historic Natchez pottery. Elsewhere Swanton
(1931:205–206) has reported that the “western”

(Hasinai) and “eastern” (Natchitoches) Caddo manifest different sorts of contact within the Southeast:
But if the clan system as exemplified
particularly by the eastern Caddo,
suggests Creek contact, the caste
features of the Hasinai recall the old
Natchez system and may indicate that the
western Caddo were once on the Red
River south of their kindred.

He cites a Creek legend which refers their origin to some point west of the Mississippi and a Caddo
legend of origin in the region of Hot Springs, Arkansas,
suggesting that Caddo and Creek may once have been
close neighbors in Arkansas. If so, this may be a most
plausible explanation for the island of engraved pottery
associated with the Southern Cult in Moundville culture.
These matters reduce to a question of recent
movements of peoples versus their acquisition of traits
by diffusion; of how much vertical change can be adduced to cultural influences upon an essentially constant physical stock. Elsewhere, physical anthropology
has contributed much pertinent information, as shown
in the correlations of Ford and Willey (1941).
The virtually complete disappearance of skeletal material in most of the river bottom sites makes it
difficult to state whether there were significant changes
in physical stock between the two Aspects. In a recent
study Goldstein34 found a number of differences in cranial and skeletal features between the Sanders site
material (Sanders Focus) and that from the Moores,
Mitchell, and Hatchel sites of Texarkana Focus. The
peoples of both foci deformed the skull, but in different
manner. The Sanders skulls are dolichocephalic and
relatively long-faced while the Texarkana are decidedly brachycephalic and short-faced. Differences in
body build were also apparent. If these two series fairly
represent the two Aspects, discrete physical composition is at least indicated. The greater part of the data
compiled by Goldstein would, however, have to be recalculated to conform to archaeological culture groupings before this interesting possibility would become
clear.
RELATIONSHIPS WITH MEXICO
The possibility of overland migration or culture
diffusion from Mexico into the Mississippi valley and
eastern states has long intrigued American archaeologists. This aspect of American prehistory remains negative to the present day, in respect to the actual occur59

Alex D. Krieger

rence of specimens between Tampico, Mexico, and
eastern Texas which could be interpreted as indicating
Middle American influence. This is not to say that
movements of peoples never took place across this
area. But if they did, the passage or passages were
made so rapidly that no archaeological evidence has
survived to record them.35 As we shall see, there are a
number of elements in Southeastern archaeological
complexes which have caused many investigators to
hypothecate Middle American origin. At present the
Texas field contributes two alternative explanations for
these occurrences: Middle American influences reached
the Southeast by some other route, or, one or more
movements of people took place across Texas, rapidly
and without leaving traces, introducing certain elements
into the Southeast (and possibly the Plains) by migration rather than by slower diffusion.
We have already discussed the extensive
carryover of traits from the general Hopewellian civilization into the Mississippian, a process of growth and
gradual change which characterizes the prehistory of
most of the eastern states. Most authorities concede
occasional injections from outside sources, but these
need to be placed on more solid bases in respect to the
specific culture complexes which could have provided
the sources, and those which were the recipients of
the introduced elements. Much progress has been made
in recent years toward organizing the vast archaeological data into cohesive complexes, both in the eastern states and in Middle America. The eastern traits
which have attracted the most attention in this matter
are those connected with ‘temple mounds” and the
shell and copper objects of the “Southern Cult.” Thomas (1887:82–86) cited some theories on identity and
origin of “Toltecs,” “Aztecs,” and “Mound Builders”
which had gained wide notoriety in his time. Some held
that “Mound Builders” were the original “Toltecs” who
later moved on into Mexico, but most held to the opposite view. Nuttall (1932) made some detailed comparisons between gorgets and copper plaques from Etowah,
Maya, and Aztec codex figures, concluding that a direct transplantation could have taken place from somewhere in Mexico at the time of the Conquest or after.
In discussing the subject one automatically looks
first toward the most direct and logical route of contact—the Gulf coast plain of Mexico and Texas. South
of the Mississippian frontier in Texas (see Figure 1),
the nearest locality in which comparable remains have
appeared is the region around Tampico in northern Vera
Cruz, popularly known as the “Huastec area.” From
the Las Flores site in Tampico, Meade (1942:Figures
56–58 and 211) illustrates conch shell gorgets on which

are engraved ceremonially garbed figures so similar to
those of the Southern Cult that a common origin can
hardly be doubted. Significantly, these figurations are
definitely more suggestive of Maya than of Aztec art
and symbolism. Saville (1900) also compares the details of an engraved gorget from the Huastec area with
Maya codex figures.
As this Tampico region is clearly a well developed northern representative of the Middle American
province, its possible connections with the Southeastern United States are of great importance. The stone
masonry and stone-faced pyramids (Meade 1942) have,
of course, no counterparts in the Southeast. However,
besides the shell gorgets, further interesting contingencies may be seen in the ceramic field. The engraving
technique of pottery decoration has been noted for the
Huastec area, including the Las Flores site from which
engraved gorgets have been recovered (Meade
1942:Figures 24 and 80). Joyce (1920:196, 317) mentions engraving as a comparable general trait between
the Huastec region, Vera Paz district of Guatemala,
and Copan in Honduras. Judging only by published illustrations, none of the engraved vessels from these
regions are strictly comparable to those in the Gibson
and Fulton Aspects in shape or design pattern, but as
no specific study of this potent problem has been made,
no opinion on whether the relationship is real or superficial can be offered at present.
Apparently in the same culture complexes with
engraving, from about Tampico southward into Central America, some striking similarities with ‘Middle
Mississippi” modeled pottery may be seen. Vaillant
(1932:Plates V–VIII) has brought together a number
of these specimens from Middle America and the central Mississippi region. Regarding the distinctive spouted
or “teapot” form of vessel, he states that it:
…occurs under early circumstances in
Salvador and at Holmul. It does not obtain
to my knowledge in the early cultures of
the Valley of Mexico. Its distribution
extends to Honduras and Costa Rica on
the south and up the east coast of Mexico
to Tampico. It occurs at Teotihuacan and
related sites, seems absent from Aztec
pottery, but is common in Oaxaca and
appears in Michoacan and Jalisco. Its
Western Mississippi distribution is
confined to the eastern valleys of the
Arkansas, St. Francis, and Middle
Mississippi. The form wherein the spout
acts as the tail of an animal reaches its
maximum development in Vera Cruz.
60

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

Further comparisons of considerable interest are
given by Vaillant:

movements of peoples or culture complexes from
Middle America into the Southeast. As the present
paper is concerned primarily with the “Caddo area,”
the general Southeastern problem is beyond its scope;
however, one outstanding fact supports Vaillant’s suggestion of two “infiltrations”: whereas the Gibson and
Fulton Aspects are featured by widespread use of engraved pottery decoration, the remarkable effigy pottery cited belongs characteristically to a region farther
east; that is, in the central Mississippi basin of eastern
Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, etc. Thus, while they
tend to mix somewhat in central Arkansas, the engraving and effigy-modeling ideas in the main occupy two
separate distribution areas. The two complexes moreover must have existed coevally, at least in part, the
effigy pottery within a shell-tempered Late Middle
Mississippi period, and the engraved pottery of Gibson
and Fulton Aspects in periods equivalent to Early and
Late Middle Mississippi, respectively.
The Southern Cult ceremonial complex itself was
evidently a third cultural entity, for its elaborated objects occur over an area considerably greater than both
the “Caddo area” engraving and the “Middle Mississippi” modeled pottery. Painted pottery decoration, although most commonly associated with modeled effigy vessels in the Late Middle Mississippi cultures,
may constitute even a fourth introduction into the Southeast at a late time.
Although these four practices or complexes—
engraving, modeled vessels, Cult elements, and painting—reveal somewhat different distributions throughout the Southeast, generally they tend to converge in
certain localities. Furthermore, along the Mississippi
and to the east, they all date within the shell temper
horizon. If they all originated elsewhere, their introductions must have taken place at roughly the same
time, that is, within a century or so after the 1540 A.D.
date line.
Turning to the Highlands of Mexico, it may be
noted that the technique of pottery decoration by engraving was fairly common in “Archaic” cultures, along
with painting (red on white and white on red), punctate
roughening, brushing, polished-over incising, etc. Engraved design motifs were simple and made on either
the inner or outer rim surface on some polished bowls,
including the tripod forms.
During the Teotihuacan periods, especially in III
(Linné 1934), the engraving technique became highly
elaborated, with intricate, glyph-like executions which
were impressed with ochre to contrast with the dark
polished background. The familiar cylindrical-shaped
vessels with three block-like legs and covers illustrate

Human effigy vessels (Plate VII), which
cover the whole Middle and Western
Mississippi region, find their closest
resemblances in Casas Grandes pottery
specifically, although the distribution of
these vessels extends along the east
coast of Mexico, as well as southward
into the Maya country and Costa Rica.
But they are also found in the Tarascan
area where, as in animal effigies, the ideal
of sculpture is emphasized at the expense
of the idea of a container. In the Middle
Mississippi region there is a development
of pots made in the form of a human head
that is paralleled only in Costa Rica and
Peru.
The creation of a human or animal
appearance in a vessel by filleting on bits
of clay, or by incising or twisting the rim
into a head form, is found in the West
Mississippi area and throughout Central
America…Although the idea of vitalizing
vessel forms by the application of
elements is so wide as to be almost a
universal New World trait, the modeling
of such forms is restricted to the higher
cultures of Middle America and northern
South America. The presence of life forms
in the West Mississippi is extraordinary
in view of the unsophisticated character
of the pottery of the eastern United States
and the comparative absence of modeling
in the Southwest…Perhaps it would not
be too far-fetched to hypothecate that the
irruption of the Nahua tribes into Vera
Cruz wedged the Huastec with their preMaya culture away from the main Maya
stem. This dislocation would have started
a successive series of thrusts to the
northward that might have ended in
shoving some peoples with Q-influenced
ceramic up the coast and thence through
the swamps of Louisiana into the West
Mississippi region…There may have been
even two such infiltrations, for the Red
River sites differ from the others in some
respects and have been attributed to the
Caddo, whose range extended far west
into Texas. I venture this hypothesis with
an open mind, not from conviction but to
stimulate discussion.

There is good reason to hypothecate at least two
61

Alex D. Krieger

the most elaborate engraved work at Teotihuacan. However, many vessels from this culture are of a brown,
glossy, well burnished ware that is highly remindful of
some Gibson and Fulton engraved types in paste, color,
texture, and polished surfaces which show tooling
marks. Engraved designs on such vessels include simple
scrolls, circles, chains, triangles, etc.
Further, the III or classic period at Teotihuacan
includes the extensive use of great spiral marine shells.
These are often carved with knobbish figures over the
exterior, or cut into dippers and other utensils. Despite
this usage of large marine shells, no examples of engraved gorgets have yet been reported from the
Teotihuacan or any Highland cultures.
A matter of possible significance is a rather
amazing similarity between the most common
Teotihuacan arrow point style and the type Hayes
Barbed of the Gibson Aspect (see Figure 3). Although
the former is invariably of obsidian and the latter of
flint, the recurved blade edges, flaring barbs, and peculiar lozenge-shaped stem with corner protrusions, are
common to both. Such similarities appear to surpass
those of chance.
With the beginning of the Tula period (the Toltec
as it is now recognized in Mexico) at perhaps 1100
A.D., both pottery engraving and conch shell working
evidently disappear from Highland Mexico. They are
almost certainly absent from all Aztec period remains
in the Valley of Mexico, although a check should be
made upon this. Engraving was thus a common decorative medium on pottery from “Archaic” times at possibly 400 A.D., until perhaps 1100 A.D., or the first
Chichimecan invasions of the Valley. During Aztec times
all pottery decoration was by painting, in several distinct styles.
If, now, we return to Vaillant’s suggestion of “a
successive series of thrusts to the northward” following upon Aztec expansion to the Mexican east coast,
we find a rough agreement between certain horizons
in northern Mexico and the Southeastern United States.
Ekholm has tentatively given a date of 1100 to 1200
A.D. or “early Aztec period” for the Las Flores material at Tampico36, including the mounds, masonry, pyramids, engraved conch shell gorgets, and engraved,
modeled, and painted pottery such as shown by Meade
(1942). Such a date would precede the estimated time
of introduction of the above-mentioned elements in the
Southeast by three to four hundred years, which would
not be an excessive difference if these elements had
reached the Southeast by slow diffusion.
As previously stated, however, the entire region
between Tampico and the Mississippian frontier in

northeastern Texas is still devoid of evidence of overland diffusion of Mexican elements.
This discrepancy in the estimated datings in the
Southeast and northeastern Mexico, must either be accounted for, or the datings may eventually have to be
revised. Aztecan influences on the Gulf coast may, it
appears to me, have taken place somewhat later than
1100 or 1200 A.D., possibly but barely preceding the
Conquest. In this event, northward thrusts into the eastern United States may have occurred either as the result of Aztecan pressures in the fifteenth century, or as
the result of the Spanish Conquest in the sixteenth century, or both. Nuttall (1932:144) has suggested that the
Etowah material may have been introduced by “an organized band of voluntary exiles, under the leadership
of a bold ‘eagle-warrior’ or ‘captain-general,’ a high
priest and other chieftains of whom, or of whose descendants, the Etowah finds are tragic mementoes. It
must not be forgotten either that the early Spanish explorers were accompanied by a large retinue of Indians, some of whom may have abandoned them and
wandered off “on their own.” Some of the finds associated with Etowah are, of course, of such widespread
distribution that such a band need not have found its
way to that particular locality.
Within the Gibson Aspect, at least three phenomena may eventually be traced to Middle American origin: the technique of engraving pottery, the shell and
copper work of the Southern Cult, and such arrow point
styles as Hayes Barbed. The Cult may or may not
have been connected originally with the other items.
The engraved pottery and arrow points superficially
seem more like those of Teotihuacan III than from other
cultures in Mexico. On the other hand, the shell gorgets
of Spiro Focus, Moundville, Dallas, Etowah, etc., have
counterparts in the Tampico or “Huastec” area, and
thence on down the Mexican coast into the Maya region rather than in Highland Mexico. As mentioned
above, Linton (1926) concluded that Coastal and Highland sources contributed separately to the Pawnee
Sacrifice to the Morning Star. Certain Natchez social
and religious customs may likewise have been gained
from more than one Middle American source. The
ceramic comparisons made by Vaillant (1932) on the
whole show many more similarities between the
“Middle Mississippi” and the lowland region stretching
from northern Vera Cruz around the Gulf and into the
Maya territory and Central America, than between the
Mississippi and interior or Highland Mexico.
This discussion contributes little toward the solution of such fascinating and all-important problems.
One thing should be evident: in several culture areas it

the shores of Galveston Bay and extends inland about
one hundred miles up the Trinity, Neches, and Sabine
valleys. This focus contains considerable plain and simply incised clay-tempered brown pottery in the form of
convex-bottomed jars and carinated bowls. This pottery is presumably associated with protohistoric and
historic Attakapan tribes, the Galveston Focus boundary in Texas agreeing almost exactly with the Attakapan
linguistic boundary given by Swanton (1911:Plate 1).
It is entirely likely that prehistoric relationships
of some kind will eventually be traced from the northeastern Mexico Gulf coast around the Texas coast and
to the Mississippi, but in the light of present evidence
such relationships would involve neither Middle American nor Mississippian civilizations, and in my opinion
would have no bearing on origins of prehistoric cultures in the “Caddo area” or the Southeast in general.
Rather, such coastal materials would tend to fall in with
the Shell Heap cultures of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal
fringe (see Haag 1942).

is becoming increasingly possible to orient specific traits
in respect to associative complexes in both space and
time. With a great deal more work, both in excavation
and examination of far-flung collections, some solid
conclusions are forthcoming.
We may add a word on that stretch of Gulf coast
between the Rio Grande and lower Louisiana. This
coast contains at least two major horizons: non-pottery
and pottery bearing. The latter was evidently very late
along this coastal strip, except perhaps for the corner
of Texas between upper Galveston Bay and Louisiana, where a few Marksville or Troyville sherds have
been recovered from the surfaces of unexcavated sites.
From Galveston Bay and Port Arthur to the Rio
Grande mouth there is abundant evidence that pottery
was unknown until protohistoric times, and in some localities until well within the historic period, which may
be taken as roughly 1720 to 1750 A.D.
Between the southwestern extremes of the Mississippi frontier and the Gulf Coast (see Figure 1), we
can recognize a Galveston Focus which centers around

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

Chapter 6
CONCLUSIONS

T

he primary objective of this paper was to present
a broad view of the archaeological material collected through the past thirty-five years or so from the
extensive region popularly associated with the “Southern” or “proper” branch of the Caddo linguistic family.
This branch consists of two main divisions of geographic rather than linguistic significance: the “Red
River” and “Hasinai” tribes. The study embraces adjacent sectors of four states: Oklahoma, Arkansas,
Louisiana, and Texas. Within this region two principal
culture horizons are defined, each of which is called an
Aspect and is represented by a series of Foci or groups
of communities possessing a uniform material culture.
Both these Aspects belong to the Mississippi Pattern,
but they differ from one another and from recognized
Phases (Upper, Early Middle, Late Middle, and a prospective Lower) of this Pattern to such an extent that
they are not here classified with any of them. Possibly
a “Red River Phase” should be established but this
matter is withheld pending wider discussion.
In the lower Red River valley, earlier culture
complexes such as those known as Marksville and
Troyville partially underlie the present Gibson and Fulton
Aspects. Farther north and west, in eastern Texas and
Oklahoma, no preceding ceramic cultures have been
discovered, yet the five foci of the Gibson Aspect reveal a large number of traits of Hopewellian (including
Marksville) derivation. Thus it appears that while the
Mississippian civilization spread westward from the
immediate Mississippi valley toward the southern Plains,
it still retained a considerable bulk of Hopewellian features, to which had been added Mississippian ceramic
complexes, temple mounds, burial practices, pipes, etc.
Each of the Gibson foci differs from the others, however, in the nature and amount of such mixture. The
Sanders, lying farthest west up the Red River valley, is
practically all Mississippian, while the Gahagan farthest down the Red River, consists almost entirely of
Hopewellian elements exclusive of its ceramics, which
are of Mississippian nature in the same sense as those
of the entire Aspect.
The engraving technique of decorating pottery
was well established in all Gibson foci and constitutes
an outstanding trait which has long been associated
with the southern “Caddo area” in general. Nowhere

else in the United States was the engraving technique
employed with such virtuosity, both in the shaping of
vessels and in the gracefulness of their decoration. The
Moundville culture of western Alabama also reveals a
remarkable development of this medium, but here it is
highly specialized toward the depiction of winged serpents and other demons connected with the Southern
Cult, and is, moreover, in striking contrast to the associated ceramics. In two Gibson Aspect foci, pottery
engraving and Southern Cult elements are associated
(Spiro and Sanders), and the presence of the Cult serves
to date the entire Aspect relative to the whole Mississippian horizon in which the Cult complex occurs (see
Figure 4). According to most authorities the Cult rose
and spread through the Southeast and central Mississippi-Ohio basin in a post-DeSoto time, perhaps about
1600 A.D., then almost as rapidly disappeared. Thus
the Gibson Aspect must have existed from some time
between 1500 and 1600 A.D. until the Cult had run its
course in that area. During this time it must have existed coevally with the Coles Creek culture of the lower
Mississippi and Red River valleys; a number of ceramic elements indicate Coles Creek influence, and
intrusive sherds from that complex have been found in
all Gibson foci except the Sanders. Possibly Coles
Creek existed through a somewhat longer period and
should be subdivided into early and late, with the “early”
preceding the Gibson Aspect, and the “late” coeval
with it.
Small oval or conical burial tumuli are known in
the Gibson foci, except Sanders, and constitute a trait
characteristic of eastern cultures from a very early
time. In addition, square, flat-topped tumuli or “temple
mounds” have been found in the Haley, Spiro, and Alto
Foci, but in no case do they seem to be arranged in
court plans as in the Coles Creek (and Troyville?) cultures.
The Fulton Aspect is held to occupy a shallow
chronological position between the termination of the
Gibson Aspect at about 1600 A.D. and the disruptions
of the Caucasian period during the early 18th century.
Six of its foci (Texarkana, Belcher, McCurtain, Titus,
Bossier, and Frankston) existed in pre-contact times or
roughly before 1680 to 1700 A.D. Another, the
Glendora Focus, is commonly but not always associ65

Alex D. Krieger

ated with sites of the Caucasian period of early trade
contacts, and represents both protohistoric and historic
Caddoan tribes. The Frankston Focus, which represents prehistoric Hasinai tribes, appears to have extended in the same essential form on into the historic
period, with the pottery type Patton Engraved an addition in this period, though it obviously developed out of
the prehistoric Poynor Engraved.
The outstanding characteristics of the Fulton
Aspect are that the many traits of Hopewellian nature
which survive into Gibson Aspect disappear almost or
completely with the Fulton; the conch shell and copper
plaques of the Southern Cult have disappeared from
the scene (a few isolated specimens may have been
retained as curios); the building of both round or oval
and pyramidal tumuli was almost totally abandoned but
such eminences left by earlier peoples were used for
camping and burial disposal and were thus incidentally
increased in size by the accumulation of camp refuse
(example, Hatchel Mound). Against these major differences and many others mentioned, the Fulton Aspect continued the general ceramic tradition of Gibson
Aspect, but with many changes in vessel shape and
design elements, and the addition of shell temper in
some types of the more northeasterly foci. For these
reasons it is problematical whether the Gibson Aspect
represents the culture of Caddoan speaking tribes, and
only the Fulton may be taken as certainly Caddoan.
Following the general description of each Aspect and the matter of ethnic identification, affiliations
with recognized cultures in various surrounding regions
were outlined. Occupying as they do a position on the
southwesterly frontier of the Mississippian province,
these Aspects face toward the southern Plains with
their hunting and late hunting-agricultural economies.
Across this belt they also face the Puebloan Southwest and northeastern Mexico. Yet the bulk of their
cultural possessions must have come from the eastern
states region in general. In addition to these considerations, it was shown that the known Caddo (i.e., Fulton
Aspect), Pawnee, and Wichita cultures were all very
late prehistoric and extended into the period of Caucasian contacts; in the territory of each of these Caddoan
branches there is an older horizon which dates approximately into the time just before and just after the DeSoto
and Coronado expeditions. The cultures of this older
but still relatively late horizon may in each case be considered as ancestral to the known Caddoan branches,
but this cannot be ascertained. The “Caddoan Root”
concept cannot be supported from the archaeological
evidence.
Some evidence of contact with the late Puebloan

cultures was given, and a rough chronological agreement was reached for all the pottery-bearing cultures
from the Rio Grande to the Mississippi. This was based
on a thin but continuous chain of cross-intrusions, plus
the presence of ceramic features in the Gibson and
Fulton Aspects, and Late Pueblo IV and Pueblo V, which
could well have been produced through exchange of
ideas. Agreements with the Mexican chronology turned
out to be less satisfactory, but the material cited at least
points to problems which need more attention before a
satisfactory chronological alignment can be made between the Southeast and Middle America through the
Tampico area.
It was also pointed out that for some time before
1700 A.D. horticulture was practiced in all the late prehistoric cultures which lay between the Southwest and
Southeast; pottery making of one kind or another also
was continuous between east and west, although the
usual opinion has been that a non-agricultural, non-ceramic “corridor” of hunters formed a barrier to contact between the Southwest and Southeast. With the
coming of the horse and more intensive bison hunting,
agricultural pursuits in northern Texas and Oklahoma
probably suffered a decline as in the central Plains.
The approach to the material in this paper has
been mainly horizontal. That is, each Aspect was discussed by comparing its foci in regard to various classes
of material. None of the foci was treated as a unit with
any fullness, although the approximate content of each
may be judged from the checklists of Tables 3 and 6.
There is no attempt to describe the actual specimens
on hand. In short, the present paper is a skeleton form
which needs a great deal of filling out wherever this
can be done with present and future material.
What I have tried to do is to gather together the
bits of information which can be gained from a number
of site reports, localized comparisons, and a great many
unpublished collections, and to weld these into an interpretive scheme. One gets the impression that a
rather great amount of digging has been done without
any greater aim than to find more and better “Caddoan”
specimens. It has been obvious for some time that the
prehistory of this part of the continent would have much
to offer toward the welding together of major sections
of the United States and Mexico. Therefore the present
paper may provide a step toward breaking the paralysis which has enveloped this region, point out various
possibilities for research, and aid field men of the future in matters to be checked in the excavations. Only
a handful of excavations have been made with traitassociation and stratigraphic problems in mind, whereas
the need for such should hardly require comment.

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

The reader will doubtlessly wish for a fuller
knowledge of each focus before the interpretations will
seem substantial. This presents a difficulty which can
hardly be completely remedied, for the cultures themselves and the material collected are dispersed over
four states, not to mention what has been carried elsewhere. Newell’s (n.d.) paper on the Davis site and
Alto Focus is to be published, while other foci well
represented in Texas are being put in preparation by
the writer. In Louisiana, Dr. C. H. Webb is preparing a
full account of Belcher Focus, to be added to the topi-

cal Belcher papers, and he and the writer have the
Bossier and Gahagan Foci under attack. The material
on which I base the Haley Focus is found mainly in the
works of Moore (1912), Harrington (1920), and Lemley
(1936); Lemley’s work at Crenshaw is being expanded
and will cast more light on this. Some Spiro Focus
material has been reported in small papers but a large
work has been under preparation for some time. And
so on.
If this paper aids in the coordination of these and
related works, it will serve its purpose.

Archaeological Horizons in the So-Called Caddo Area

END NOTES
1

Prepared through the liberal support of The University of Texas as part of a program in Research in Anthropology. I am
particularly indebted to Dr. James B. Griffin of the Ceramic Repository for the Eastern United States, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and
Dr. Clarence H. Webb of Shreveport, Louisiana, for constant discussion, stimulating criticism, and access to information which
all helped greatly toward the final result.

2

Pearce (1932a, 1932b, 1932c) repeatedly referred to a large south Texas midden site as a “mound.” The human occupation of
this site, just south of Victoria on the coastal plain, forms a huge cap over a gravel bar marking a former course of the Guadalupe
River. Excavation in 1939–40 provided no evidence of intentional construction, hence Pearce’s insistence that it links moundbuilding in Mexico and the Mississippi area is entirely disproved.

3

Pearce’s mention (1932b:681–682, and Note 1) of the Sanders site as a “Shawnee” buffer village west of the Caddo is purely
imaginative. In the same paper the A. C. Saunders site in Anderson County is misspelled A. C. Sanders and should not be
confused with T. M. Sanders. Other sites briefly described in the two papers are: Russell, Titus County, J. M. Riley, Upshur
County, H. R. Taylor, Harrison County.

4

For explanation of projectile point terminology, see A. D. Krieger, “The Typological Concept,” American Antiquity, Volume 9,
1944.

5

Vaillant (1932) listed eleven (11) “ceramic traits which are quite foreign to the run of the pottery of the eastern United States.”
Mason referred to these as “eleven detailed ceramic types.”
6

The “Phase” of Gila Pueblo (Gladwin 1934) is quite comparable to the McKern “Focus,” hence I do not believe the divergence
in content between Sayles’ groupings and my own is due to terminology.

7
B. F. French in his translation of de la Harpe, “Historical Journal of the Establishment of the French in Louisiana” (Historical
Collections of Louisiana, Part III, pp. 18–19, 1851) describes the arrival, in 1700, of de Bienville at “the Ouachita village” on the
river of that name after seven days on foot from the Red River. Seven days up the Ouachita from the Red would place this village
very close to the historic Glendora and Keno sites excavated by Moore (1909), hence there seems little doubt that these sites also
represent historic locations of Caddoan-speaking people closely related to Natchitoches.

8

C. H. Webb (personal communication July 25, 1943) states that both these sites have yielded only small amounts of Caucasian
material, and neither includes enough pottery of Glendora Focus types to establish the presence of that Focus. Furthermore,
the bulk of the pottery from both sites is thick, clay tempered, incised, punctated, or brushed, and lacks red film and shell
temper, hence rather definitely belongs to a period earlier than Glendora. More specifically, most of the Wilkinson site pottery
compares closely with Alto Focus types. That at Allen includes examples of Alto Focus types plus plain vessels such as those
found by Webb at Smithport Landing. These sites are, therefore, mainly prehistoric, with a thin accretion in the historic which
may or may not prove to be Glendora Focus.

9

Lemley’s diagrams of Mound B show this relationship quite clearly.

11

The News Letter descriptions of these ceramic types (see note 10) were written by Ford and Willey and contain further notes
on the distribution of French Fork and Coles Creek pottery from Crenshaw to Florida. The Florida type closely comparable to
French Fork Incised is now known as Weeden Island Incised (Willey and Woodbury, 1942:253 and Figures 27c, e).

12
I am deeply indebted to Judge Lemley for his willingness to let me study his collections and notes. Mr. M. P. Miroir of
Texarkana likewise allowed me to examine his valuable notes and specimens from the Crenshaw, Foster, and Battle sites.

13

In reviewing this material for January, 1942, and January 1943, Webb and the writer agreed on the term “Belcher Focus” for
the two upper levels. The fourth level is clearly non-Belcher Focus, while the third may be a mixture or transition.

14

The Alto Focus is based on the excavation of a large tumulus near the Neches River in Cherokee County, Texas, by P. H.
Newell under the WPA-University of Texas State-wide Archaeological Survey in 1939–41.

The only eye-in-hand symbol in the Spiro Focus of which I am aware occurs on a shell gorget, whereas this symbol occurs on
engraved jars and stone plaques at Moundville. This gorget is pictured on the cover of The Oklahoma Prehistorian, Vol. II, No. 2,
July 1939, Tulsa.
16

Dr. James B. Griffin, University of Michigan, has a slide in his files of a splendid “monolithic” axe purportedly from this site.
This is no more than may be expected in connection with Cult sites, but this is the only such axe I have heard of in the Gibson
Aspect.

17

Harrington’s notes are as follows: Ozan 1: “Mound 1,” a house more or less square, 18½ by 19½ feet, with entrance of parallel
post rows, no other data; “Mound 2,” three “altars” or prepared firebasins, but houses, if any, not recoverable. Washington site:
“Mound 2,” house 20 feet in “diameter;” “Mound 3,” round house, diameter 33 feet; “Mound 5,” house 36 feet in “diameter;”
“Mound 9,” a “squarish” house about 16 feet in “diameter;” “Mound 10,” a “square room some 17 feet in diameter” with
fireplace near center; “Mound 11,” a house of “rather large size;” “Mounds 4, 6–8,” said to contain houses but not described.
Mineral Springs: “Mound 3,” house “about 50 feet in diameter;” “Mound 9,” “remains of a two-chambered earth-lodge;”
“Mounds 4–5, 7–8, 10–11,” houses indicated but not described. All the above structures are termed “earth lodges” in Harrington’s
work. Many of the “mounds” are but very slight heaps formed by collapse of the houses; i.e., they were not constructed
platforms for buildings.

18

Many of the Davis houses were made with the use of a tree or large post as a central pillar during construction. When the
house was completed, this was cut off close to the ground and removed, a central fire basin then being placed where the post had
been.

19

Griffin (n.d. and communication) places the “Buzzard Cult,” as he calls it, in a post-DeSoto shell temper horizon at
Moundville. Lewis and Kneberg (1941) describe the Cult-bearing Dallas Focus in eastern Tennessee as shell temper and postDeSoto. Phillips (1940) connects the elaborate conch and copper work of Moundville, Etowah, and the Tennessee-KentuckyMissouri area with the “Middle Mississippi” phase or culture in general, at least implying a late date. Ford and Willey
(1941:358) state that, “Although the cult which spread these objects probably flourished about 1600 A.D., there are some finds
showing that certain features, at least, lasted until after 1700 A.D.”
20

For type descriptions see Southeastern Archaeological Conference News Letter, Vol. I, No. 1, 1939. Extensive use of fingernail
gouging and pinching on jar bodies in the Alto Focus is also remindful of the type Alexander Pinched in the Pickwick-Wheeler
Basins area. However, the vessels with this treatment are clay and carbon tempered in the Alto Focus and are not strictly
comparable to the sand-tempered Alexander series.

21

I cannot vouch for the accuracy of these lists in the Oklahoma area; there may be continuities from Spiro to McCurtain and
Fort Coffee which are inconsistent with the remainder of the field.

22

“Features common to these sites are: situation on low hills flanking the Red River valley, or on lakes and streams which drain
into this valley, with chief concentration along the valley borders; no mounds (three sites have low sand knolls on top of hills);
extended and supine burials, usually single; no bunched, flexed, or cremated burials; no, or comparatively few, grave goods,
those present nearly always consisting of pottery alone and placed around the head; shallow burials; ungrooved celts; rough
sandstone “metates” (seed grinding slabs); oval or rectangular rough manos, pitted manos or nut stones; both small flat
triangular and large keel-shaped scrapers with the small predominating; occasional stone beads; occasional pottery bead or
figurine; small flanged drill in some sites; elbow pipes of pottery (rare); perforated pottery disks, the perforation usually quite
smooth; varied projectile points, nearly every site having a wide range, including Hayes Barbed, Alba Barbed, Gahagan Notched
Triangular, and Bassett Pointed Stem (the first three may belong rather to Alto Focus, Bassett intrusive from Titus or Belcher
Focus where it is more common); more numerous larger points and blades, triangular, lozenge, stemmed, barbed, concave base,
and multiple-notched in some sites (see Ford 1936:89 and Figure 15); shell and copper work not found so far; no Caucasian
objects; pottery from each site typically runs the gamut as shown by Ford (1936:Figures 16 and 18) for the Wilkinson and
Harrison Bayou sites, with predominant types being Pease Brushed-Incised, Harrison Bayou Incised, Sinner Linear Punctated,
Maddox Band Engraved, and perhaps some carrying over from the Alto Focus, such as Hardy Incised, Davis Incised, Weches
Fingernail Impressed, etc.; intrusions from Belcher Focus such as bowls and bottles of Belcher Engraved, jars of Belcher Ridged
and Cowhide Stamped—these intrusions being more common in the more northern sites closest to Belcher site; a few shell
tempered and red filmed sherds intrusive; bone temper rare except at Keatchie and Sinner sites; otherwise great majority of
pottery is clay and grit tempered; in most sites one to four percent of decorated sherds have notched lips.”

24

Two other excavated sites—Paul Mitchell and E. H. Moores—lie close to Hatchel, 10-12 miles NW of Texarkana, and may also
be possible locations of the upper Nasoni village. Moores has yielded Caucasian trade beads and Glendora pottery as an historic
accretion to a Texarkana Focus complex.

27

In the Alto Focus and Fulton Aspect all vessels were coiled with seams slanting from exterior downward into the interior.
Neck-banded jars were coiled in the same manner, up to the body rim junction, from where the slant was reversed to allow the coils
to overlap shingle-fashion on the rim exterior. This reversal indicates a conscious effort to produce the neck-banding effect in
spite of retaining the traditional construction for the rest of the vessel. In the Southwest, I believe that coiling usually or always
proceeded with seams slanting downward toward the exterior, so that exterior overlapping resulted automatically unless it was
smoothed over.

28

Third Round-Table Conference of the Sociedad Mexicana de Antropologia, held in Mexico, D. F., August 25 to September 3,
1943.

29

At the Davis site in central East Texas (Alto Focus) Newell found four examples of square houses with rounded corners, but
without extended entranceways or center posts, also cache pits in the floors of some round houses, likewise without entranceways
or center posts. Whether these features affiliate with the Plains area or some Southeastern cultures is not clear as yet.

30

“The long-stemmed clay pipes of the southern Caddoans are apparently lacking in Nebraska, although certain of the shortstemmed ‘variants’ do resemble the pipes of the Pawnee” (Wedel 1936:81). This agrees with the present interpretation: the
Pawnee and Fulton Aspect Caddoan pipes do resemble one another and are rather closely contemporaneous; the Gibson Aspect
long-stemmed pipes are probably common in the Gahagan and Haley Foci, fading out toward Spiro Focus, failing to appear in
the Plains. However, Wedel’s contention (1936:100) that “thin, delicately chipped triangles or arrowpoints of chert...(form a)
preponderance over all other forms in Iroquoian and Caddoan areas...” is unacceptable for the Caddoan area, for such arrow
points are absent from all the foci, although they do occur farther west in the Henrietta Focus and historic Wichita sites.

31

Plummet and boat stones, as well as banner stones, have been found in this area, especially in southern Arkansas, but have not
been associated with definite archaeological culture.

32

For example, the closely packed, deeply incised or grooved lines of Marksville Incised that run in curvilinear and concentriccircle designs (Ford and Willey 1940) are continued in similar form in Yokena Incised of the Troyville period (Southeastern
Archaeological Conference News Letter, Vol. 1, No. 3, 1939). No types of the following Coles Creek and Gibson Aspect include
similar lines or motifs, but in the very late Fulton Aspect several types produce incised designs which are often difficult to
distinguish from Marksville and Yokena Incised, except that these late types often include shell temper. Among these may be
mentioned Foster Trailed-Incised of Belcher and Texarkana Foci, Cowhide Stamped of Belcher, and Keno Trailed of Glendora;
also Fatherland Incised of the Natchezan culture (see Quimby 1942:Plate XIII). When whole, or reasonably whole, vessels are
obtained, most Marksville-Troyville incising is readily distinguished from the late types. Nevertheless some rather surprising
parallels have appeared. Two shell-tempered vessels intrusive in a late East Texas site (H. R. Taylor) even have “Marksville
rims,” cross-hatched in the typical manner. A bottle undobtedly of a Glendora Focus shape with extended base and bulging neck,
also shell tempered, from the Riley site in East Texas, has four conventionalized bird heads in a curvilinear pattern quite like
Marksville and Hopewellian. This design is executed by rough scoring between deeply grooved bordering lines, perhaps in
imitation of stamping. In all, it strongly indicates a simulation of Marksville Stamped decoration, but its shape, paste, shell
temper, and association leave no doubt of its late Fulton Aspect position (illustrated by Pearce [1932b:Plate 23a]). In citing
similarities between Marksville pottery and two vessels found by Harrington in Arkansas, Seltzer (1933) was dealing with such
an apparent imitation of Marksville Stamped and Marksville Incised vessels by Fulton Aspect peoples. The fact remains that no
connecting link has been found in Coles Creek and Gibson Aspect ceramics.

33

Belcher Focus is an exception, shell temper occuring with some frequency in jars of Foster Trailed-Incised, Cowhide Stamped,
and Belcher Ridged, but not in the engraved vessels, though the latter are often without temper.

One instance of unusual interest is the finding of Aztecan potsherds on the surface of the Morhiss “Mound” on the Guadalupe
River near Victoria in south-central Texas (see Note 2). These sherds are from the typical bowls of yellowish paste with black
painted decoration, three rectangular legs, and cross-scored bottoms. In this case, however, fragments of glazed mission
crockery and Majolica ware (early 18th century) were recovered on the surface of the same site, hence the Aztecan sherds may
have reached there through the hands of servants accompanying the Spaniards to the nearby Goliad missions.
