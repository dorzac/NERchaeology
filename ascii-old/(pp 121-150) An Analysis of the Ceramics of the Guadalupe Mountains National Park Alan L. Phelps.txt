AN ANALYSIS OF THE CERAMICS OF
THE GUADALUPE MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK
ALAN L. PHELPS

ABSTRACT
The pottery sherds collected by the Texas Archaeological Society Field
School from the Guadalupe Mountains National Park are identified and
classified. The sherds are tabulated by site and sites are assigned a date
span through the use of ceramic cross-dating. Ceramic attributes are
examined with the purpose of identifying the occupants and isolating
possible settlement patterns; the latter being attempted by using various
site groupings. An hypothesis is proposed that places a Jornada-Mogollon
occupation in the Guadalupe Mountains National Park between A.D. 850
and A.D. 1350.

INTRODUCTION
More than 3,000 sherds of pottery were recovered by personnel of
the Texas Archaeological Society (TAS) Field School during their
Guadalupe Mountains National Park (GMNP) survey in June of 1970.
The sherds were tentatively identified by John Runyan of Hobbs, New
Mexico in the field laboratory and all but the very smallest were
cataloged with the site number from which they were collected. Bags
were marked with site numbers and the sherds from the appropriated
site were placed inside. A sampling of sherds was selected at random
and a temper analysis was performed in the field environment. The
sample was then examined in detail, field identification refined and
the sherds classified.
The purpose of this report is to tabulate by site the sherds of each
pottery type represented in the collection and to group the sites in an
attempt to identify any settlement or living patterns. Additionally,
ceramic cross-dating is used in assigning a date span to each ceramic
bearing site. A description of the modified sherds found within the
park is included~ a general discussion of ceramics follows, and the
report concludes with a short summary.
The report is oriented toward, and emphasizes, the Jornada Branch
of the Mogollon (Jornada-Mogollon District as defined by Lehmer
(1948). Jornada-Mogollon was also the predominant pottery group
identified in the GMNP’collection and represented 70% of the total
ceramics. The sample collected was considered to be representative of
the areas surveyed but not necessarily representative of the park
ceramics as a whole (Shafer 1970). The use of the terms GMNP, GMNP
area and GMNP region in this report pertains to those portions of the

122

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

GMNP surveyed by the TAS Field School. The survey was conducted
primarily on the western and southern flanks of the central
Guadalupe massif.
CONSIDERATIONS
Identification refinement and classification of the pottery sherds
brought to light certain analytical problems, notably the generally
small size of the sherds and weathering of their surfaces. All sherds
were collected from the surface, and weathering had caused a deterioration of surfaces, a chalky appearance of slips and obliterated designs. Both size and weathering rendered positive identification very
difficult and the determination of design elements and motifs often
impossible. Sherd size was also an important factor in differentiating
olla (jug) from bowl sherds, a distinction which had an impact on the
analysis of the ceramics.
Identification difficulties created a genuine quandary when distinguishing E1 Paso or Jornada Brown from El Paso Polychrome. Both E1
Paso Brown (Lehmer 1948) and Jornada Brown (Mera 1943) were
considered ancestral to E1 Paso Polychrome (Stallings 1931), and
sherds of E1 Paso Polychrome that did not display painting were often
impossible to distinguish from either of the brown wares. The existence of E1 Paso and Jornada Red on Brown and Black on Brown
(Lehmer 1948; Gerald n.d.), types intermediate between E1 Paso and
Jornada Brown and E1 Paso Polychrome, added to the identification
difficulty.
The above variables were considered before an interpretation was
made of a site that contained appreciable amounts of the two Brown
wares, El Paso Polychrome and types generally associated with the
aforementioned three. Such mixed pottery situations were frequently
encountered during the GMNP survey, and a distinction between the
brown wares and polychrome was significant in establishing a relative placement for the ceramically heterogenous sites.
Finally, not all the observed sherds were collected from sites where
ceramics were found. Within large sites all recovered sherds were
obtained from an arbitrarily designated area in an attempt to diminish
a collecting bias. Sherd collecting in other than the large sites was
accomplished solely in a random manner and no attempt was made to
recover all the sherds.
SITE GROUPING
Grouping sites by different criteria can be valuable in attempts to
discern settlement patterns, since such patterns will often display a

GUADALUPE CERAMICS

123

distribution relative to a great number of variables. Three criteria were
selected in an attempt to isolate any such patterns within the GMNP:
chronological ordering of ceramic types; life zones; and spatial and
topographical grouping (see Table 1). This latter group is subdivided
in Table I to establish the relationship of each site to selected terrain
features as well as the relationship of each site to the other sites. These
two subdivisions are presented in Table 1 as "terrain category" and
"spatial group."
Those sites that contained pottery were plotted on the United States
Geological Survey map (1933 edition) of Guadalupe Peak, Texas, with
a scale of 1:62,500 and a contour interval of 50 feet. A color code was
used to distinguish site size based upon the number of sherds collected from a site. The relative size of sites was arbitrarily established
as follows: small, less than 25 sherds; medium, 25 through 75 sherds;
large, more than 75 sherds. Of the 59 GMNP sites with ceramic
association, ten had an excess of 75 sherds, 16 contained from 25-75
sherds and 33 were in the "small" category. Five of the identified sites
were not plotted on the map; all were situated in Culberson County
beyond the range of the map and two of the five were located south of
the principal survey area in the Delaware Mountains region.

CHRONOLOGICAL ORDERING
Pottery types identified in the GMNP ceramic collection were as
follows: Alma Plain (Haury 1936); Jornada Brown (Mera 1943); E1
Paso Brown (Lehmer 1948); South Pecos Brown (Jelinek 1967);
Middle Pecos Micaceous Brown (Jelinek 1967); Roswell Brown
(Jelinek 1967); McKenzie Brown (Jelinek 1967); Playas Red (Ceramic
Conference 1969); San Andres Red on Terra Cotta (McCluney 1962);
Three Rivers Red on Terra Cotta (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932);
Lincoln Black on Red (Mera and Stallings 1931); Mimbres Black on
White (Hawley 1950); Chupadero Black on White (Mera 1931); Crosby
Black on Gray (Jelinek 1967); Casas Grandes Rubbed Scored (Ceramic
Conference 1969); E1 Paso Polychrome (Stallings 1931); Ramos
Polychrome (Ceramic Conference 1969); St. John’s Polychrome
(Hawley 1950); and Escondido Polychrome (Ceramic Conference
1969). Many sherds of Casas Grandes or Chihuahua ware were not
positively identified as to specific type. Red on brown variants of
Middle Pecos Micaceous, South Pecos and Roswell pottery (Jelinek
1967) were identified, as were red on brown and textured (incised,
corrugated, scored, etc.) variants of E1 Paso andJornada ware (Lehmer
1948; Gerald n.d.).
The chronological ordering of the GMNP ceramics was based on a

correlation of the date spans presently accepted for each of the identified pottery types (Breternitz 1966; Hawley 1950; Ceramic Conference 1969). Pottery phases were formed as temporal divisions and
their sequential placement was developed with the phases of the
Jornada-Mogollon providing a guide. Lehmer (1948) perceived the
Jornada-Mogollon as consisting of a northern and a southern sequence, each with a common opening phase (Hueco) and three subsequent phases. He identified, from early to late, the Capitan, Three
Rivers and San Andres as the ensuing phases in the north, and in the
south he established the Mesilla, Dona Aria and E1 Paso phases.
Lehmer also delineated the provenience of the Jornada-Mogollon and
assigned the Guadalupe Mountains, within which the Park is located,
as the eastern boundary. Aten (1972) suggested, based upon his excavation at the Northgate Site in E1 Paso County, Texas, that Lehmer’s
phases are rough guesses requiring considerable improvement. In
particular, he believes that Lehmer’s definition of the Mesilla phase is
weak and that it should have an earlier beginning date.
The Middle Pecos Valley ceramic sequence as defined by Jelinek
(1967) was also considered in the GMNP ceramics ordering, but the
GMNP sample more closely approximated the pottery of the
Jornada-Mogollon. The Middle Pecos Valley sequence was separated
into northern and southern areas similar to Lehmer’s (1948) northern
and southern sub-branches of the Jornada-Mogollon, but no boundaries as such were proposed for the Middle Pecos Valley sequence. It
could be inferred that the Middle Pecos Valley region was bounded on
the south by the area about and slightly down river of Roswell, New
Mexico, and on the north by Ft. Summer, New Mexico. The eastern
and western extremities were limited, with the exception of the Rio
Hondo section, by the general confines of the Pecos River Valley. No
portion of the Middle Pecos Valley could be spatially affiliated with
the GMNP.
Three ceramic phases are defined for the GMNP: an Early with a
date span of A.D. 850-1100, an Intermediate occurring from A.D. 1050
to A.D. 1250, and a Late ranging from A.D. 1200 to A.D. 1350. The
pottery types that constituted the Early phase were E1 Paso, Jornada,
Middle Pecos Micaceous, South Pecos and Roswell Brown, Alma
Plain, Mimbres Black on White and San Andres Red on Terra Cotta.
Red on brown variants of the Brown wares appeared occasionally but
were never particularly common within the park. Later types such as
E1 Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black on White, Three Rivers Red on
Terra Cotta and Crosby Black on Gray were observed in a very few
early sites in decidedly small amounts, forecasting the subsequent
Intermediate phase. The Early phase was characterized by a prepon-

GUADALUPE CERAMICS

127

derance of Brown wares and compared in time span to Lehmer’s
(1948) Capitan-Mesilla phase and the opening years of his Three
Rivers-Dona Ana phase and to Jelinek’s (1967) 18 Mile phase.
An approximate balance between plain and decorated wares was
achieved during the Intermediate phase. McKenzie Brown was added
to the inventory of brown wares of the previous phase while E1 Paso
Polychrome, Chupadero Black on White and Crosby Black on Gray
increased considerably in prominence. Three Rivers Red on Terra
Cotta, which evolved fromSan Andres Red on Terra Cotta (McCluney
1962), did not occur in any quantity, nor did the latter in the Early
phase. The Mogollon wares, Alma Plain and Mimbres Black on
White, decreased in popularity from the preceding phase and eventually disappeared. El Paso and Jornada Red on Brown and textured
variants, in addition to red on brown varieties of Middle Pecos
Micaceous, Roswell and South Pecos wares, were present but not in
appreciable quantities. The later stages of Lehmer’s (1948) Three
Rivers-Dona Ana phase and Jelinek’s (1967) Mesita Negra phase related to the GMNP Intermediate phase.
The Late ceramic phase featured an influx of pottery from distant
regions. Casas Grandes textured wares, Playas Red, Ramos Polychrome andEscondido Polychrome entered from the Mexican state of
Chihuahua (Ceramic Conference 1969) while St. John’s Polychrome
arrived from New Mexico (Hawley 1950). All these pottery types were
probably introduced through the E1 Paso area Jornada-Mogollon. The
Casas Grandes and Playas Red textured wares did not replace El Paso
orJornada textured pottery and were not a major factor in the GMNP.
Brown wares were less prominent than in the Intermediate phase;
decorated pottery dominated the Late phase. Jelinek’s (1967) McKenzie phases and Lehmer’s (1948) closing E1 Paso-San Andres phase
were compatible with the last ceramic phase of the GMNP with one
notable exception: plain wares did not practically cease to exist as
Lehmer (1948) suggested for the Jornada-Mogollon, but simply decreased in abundance from the Early through the Late phases. Jelinek
(1967) observed a similar reduction in prominence of plain wares in
the Middle Pecos Valley but also noted an increase in one later
variety, McKenzie Brown.
Unfortunately, the allocation of a site to one of the ceramic phases
was not always a simple task. Continued occupation, repeated reoccupation (creating a multi-component site) or sherd scattering caused
a condition whereby a particular site could be simultaneously placed
in two of the three phases. Such a situation was characteristic of some
of the GMNP sites and the solution in most cases was to place the site
in question in the phase indicated by the latest pottery type rep-

resented in the site’s ceramics. Such a method was patterned after
Jelinek’s (1967) treatment of sites in the Middle Pecos Valley; sherds
within a site which were not compatible with the phase to which the
site was assigned were termed "salvage" sherds of an earlier phase.
Most sites with a minimum number of sherds did not lend themselves
well to dating, and the establishment of a date span for such sites was
tenuous at best. An overlapping of the dates for the Intermediate
phase was intentionally incorporated to facilitate the accommodation
of most of the multi-component sites discovered in the park. It was not
intended to imply that if a site was included in a particular ceramic
phase it was occupied throughout the span of years established for
that phase, but rather that occupation took place during a period of
time encompassed by the date span.
The accompanying chart (Table 2) graphically illustrates that the
GMNP sherd sample was dominated (81%) by pottery types native to
the two ceramic sequences previously mentioned: the JornadaMogollon (70%) as defined by Lehmer (1948) and the Middle Pecos
Valley (11%) as outlined by Jelinek (1967).
LIFE ZONES
Four major life zones are represented in the GMNP: Lower Sonoran,
Upper Sonoran, Transition and Canadian (Burns 1967). A well
documented discussion of the flora and fauna of the life zones of the
park is found in Burns (1967) and will not be detailed here. Ceramic
bearing sites identified by the GMNP survey were located exclusively
in the Lower and Upper Sonoran zones, and the majority (82%) were
found in the lower division.
The Lower Sonoran is the most arid of the four zones in this
relatively dry region. It incorporates the flat lands and a generous
portion of the foothills of the Guadalupe Mountains. The Lower
Sonoran terminates and the Upper Sonoran begins at four to five
thousand feet, depending on the immediate topography. An arbitrary
division of the two Sonoran zones was established at 4,500 feet to
provide easier classification of the surveyed sites.
The Upper Sonoran zone extends to a seven or eight thousand feet
altitude and encompasses most of the foothills and a large part of the
mountains proper. The Transition zone is limited to the highest
sections of the Guadalupe Mountains while the Canadian zone is
severely restricted to the highest peaks in the southern portion of the
range.
The western and southern slopes of the Guadalupe Mountains are
more precipitous than the eastern or northern (Newell 1953) and the

GUADALUPE CERAMICS

135

range is bordered on the west by an immense playa or lake bed locally
termed "Crow Flats". The lower elevations of the western slope are
dominated by sand ridges which are generally oriented east to west.
The majority of sites were found in these ridges. Evidence of occupancy in the Upper Sonoran was restricted to ceramically small sites,
80% of which were classified as early units. No pottery bearing sites
were located in the Transition or Canadian zones.
SPATIAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
An inspection of the map indicated an obvious spatial clustering of
the majority of sites in four areas (Table 1). The first area was a
scattering of sites near a major arroyo (intermittent stream) in the
northwestern section of the surveyed region. Sites in this area ranged
from small to large and were primarily early ceramic. The second area
was adjacent to the large playa and the sites were generally distributed along a north-south line on the western edge of the survey area. It
encompassed the greatest number of sites and seven of the ten large
sites discovered during the survey. The group of seven large sites
consisted of two Early, three Intermediate and two Late phase sites.
However, within the entire second area, Early phase sites were more
numerous than the Intermediate or Late category, but were not a
majority. There was no particular imbalance of site size within the
area since it contained seven each of large and small sites and four
medium sites.
A third area, which included a prominent hill, was a collection of
six sites south and east of the second area. It presented a fairly
balanced spectrum of sites in terms of chronological phasing. The
majority of sites were medium in size and the area contained no large
sites.
The final area, which was the largest, combined the sites in a valley
at the southern limit of the surveyed region. The area included sites
that were predominantly Early ceramic (66%) and usually small in
size (eleven of fifteen sites contained less than 25 sherds). The one
large site in the valley was the second largest encountered during the
survey and was categorized as Intermediate phase.
Six sites displayed no particular spatial relationship and were
considered isolated. Although isolated, they were not eliminated
from the overall analysis.
Four terrain features were selected for the final grouping method; a
method that was complementary to the life zone treatment. The plotted location of each site that contained pottery was carefully inspected and each site placed in one of four terrain categories: (1)

136

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

alluvial fans; (2) flats; (3) hills; and (4) canyons (see Table 1). Sites
were also examined for proximity to arroyos or springs but this terrain
feature was not used as a basic criterion. Twenty-nine of the GMNP
sites, a majority, were situated on alluvial fans. Fourteen sites were
located on the flats and adjacent to the playa and yielded some of the
largest ceramic samples. The remaining sites were found in canyons
(9), on the slope of a hill (3) or were not plotted on the map (5).
Less than 33% of the sites could be associated with arroyos or
springs. It was surprising that more sites were not associated with
present water sources in this arid region; however, water may have
been more abundant during prehistoric times, as suggested by Burns
(1967) and Riches (1970). Additionally, Burns (personal communication) had information concerning a map dating from the Civil War
period that pinpointed numerous springs in the sandy sections of the
western section of the park; these springs no longer exist.
Canyon and hill sites comprised slightly more than 20% of the total
ceramic sites. Canyon locations were observed exclusively in the
southeastern portion of the surveyed area, with the exception of the
two sites in the northern reaches that were classified as isolated.
These latter sites, combined with two other isolated canyon sites,
comprised approximately 45% of the canyon sites. Conversely, canyon sites, all of which were small in size, represented two-thirds of the
isolated sites. All of the isolated sites were small and were basically
Early ceramic. Two of the three hill sites were situated on two s eparate
hills in the third "site proximity" area. The other hill site was located
in the large southern valley and yielded a large ceramic sample.
An especially interesting distribution of sites, one that was relative
to both size and proximity to a particular terrain feature, was that 70%
of the large sites were situated in the flats adjacent to the large lake
bed. Another revealing distribution pattern was the indiscriminate
location of Early, Intermediate and Late phase sites throughout the
surveyed area. Also, Early, Intermediate and Late sites displayed no
apparent affinity to any terrain feature.
MODIFIED SHERDS
Very few ceramic tools and ornaments were discovered during the
survey, and those recovered were from the two largest sites, 41HZ68
and 41CU19. There were five spindle whorls, three of Jornada Brown
and one each of E1 Paso Brown and Mimbres Black on White. These
five artifacts were small and crudely made, as contrasted with many
spindle whorls from E1 Paso area Jornada-Mogollon sites (Lehmer
1948; Moore 1947; Moore and Wheat 1951; Phelps 1967).

GUADALUPE CERAMICS

137

Another pottery artifact, an El Paso Polychrome bowl rim modified
by smoothing three sides (the fourth side was the vessel rim), was
collected from 41HZ68. It is a curved artifact, rectangular in shape
with rounded corners, and measured 7.5 centimeters in length, 3.3
centimeters in width and was a fairly uniform .6 centimeters in
thickness. The object was possibly a scraper similar to those described
by Lehmer (1948).
The final artifact, which appeared to be a pendant, was made of
Jornada Brown and was also found in 41HZ68. The specimen was
oval in shape with the suspension hole drilled from both sides. It was
a relatively good piece of workmanship and measured 5.4 centimeters
in length, 4.3 centimeters at the widest section and was uniformally .7
centimeters thick.
These few modified potsherds seemed meager in quantity considering the number of sites identified and the number of shards collected
in the GMNP. Their scarcity was even more noteworthy in view of the
fact that survey teams most likely collected every modified potsherd
encountered. These artifacts are not uncommon in E1 Paso area
Jornada-Mogollon sites (Lehmer 1948; Moore 1947; Moore and Wheat
1951; Phelps 1967).
Jelinek (1967) made little mention of modified sherds or pottery
tools in the Middle Pecos Valley, nor did Burns (1967) or Riches
(1970) indicate the existence of many ceramic artifacts in the open
sites of southeastern New Mexico.
GENERAL COMMENTS
The criteria that distinguish El Paso Brown from Jornada Brown
and both from E1 Paso Polychrome has perplexed archaeologists for a
number of years (Jelinek 1967; Jennings and Neuman 1940; Gerald
n.d.; Riches 1970).
Mera (1943) maintained that the dominant pottery of the Tularosa
Basin and adjacent areas was Jornada Brown. Jelinek (1967) provided
the best description of Jornada Brown using the type descriptions of
Mera and Jennings, with minor modifications. Jelinek listed the major
characteristics of the pottery as: paste -- "tan to black", frequent
"black" core; temper-- primarily feldspar with quartz and infrequent
mica as secondary agents; finish -- hand smoothed with frequent
polish, infrequent tool smoothing, some temper protrusion; derivation -- Alma Plain(?).
Lehmer (1948) agreed with Mera in thatJornada Brown dominated
the northern Jornada Branch of the Mogollon (as Lehmer classified the
archaeological materials) but maintained that E1 Paso Brown, a new

138

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

type, was characteristic of the southern two thirds of the JornadaMogollon domain. He likened both Jornada and E1 Paso Brown to a
coarser form of Alma Plain and distinguished the former from the
latter as generally being polished and having a finer tempering material.
Lehmer (1948) presented a formal description of E1 Paso Brown and
asserted that the paste was soft, granular and friable, "light brown to
black" in color with carbon streaks often present. The temper consisted of angular fragments of limestone and quartz of up to 1.5
millimeters in size. Prominence, size and profusion of temper was
distinctive. Finish was characterized by a smooth matte with considerable variation in the degree of smoothing, and color varied from
"buff to dark brown" with fire clouds common.
Others in the E1 Paso area noted that the color range of Jornada
Brown paste and finish was greater than that of E1 Paso Brown, that
carbon streaks and firing clouds were only occasionally found in
Jornada Brown and that particle protrusion occurred infrequently.
They also determined that the wall thickness of Jornada Brown was
ordinarily thinner than that of E1 Paso Brown and that the latter was
generally more restricted in rim treatment (Moore 1947; Brook 1966,
1967; Fritz 1969; Hedrick 1967; Phelps 1966, 1967, 1968b; Moore and
Wheat 1951).
Jelinek (1967) did not recognize differences in E1 Paso and Jornada
Brown and stated that the ]ornada Brown identified in the Middle
Pecos Valley "includes all of the relatively coarse-tempered brownware which was not assigned to one of the other types." He did list a
coarse form as a variant of the basic Jornada type.
Similarly, Riches (1970), after researching most of the available
written material, discussed the situation briefly and decided that E1
Paso Brown was a coarsened form of Jornada Brown. She did, as
opposed to Jelinek, separate and tabulate the two in her pottery
listings.
Burns (1967) did not speculate at length in the controversy but
endorsed the proposition thatE1 Paso Brown andJornada Brown were
two separate ceramic types. Neither Greer (1968) nor Corley (1965)
addressed the problem, but both acknowledged each type in their
pottery discussions.
Runyan (ms.), in an analysis of the sherds from the GMNP survey,
noted that E1 Paso Brown contained large "white" temper particles
(elements not specified) of as much as three millimeters in size and
that the temper material protruded through the smooth finish of the
sherds. It was determined that Jornada Brown temper particles were

GUADALUPE CERAMICS

139

usually smaller than those of E1 Paso Brown and were normally 1.5
millimeters or less in size. It was also found that Jornada Brown
generally had a semi- to fairly good floated surface which was often
polished.
Jornada Brown, in its native area, was apparently a northern manifestation of E1 Paso Brown, or vice versa, with differences in temper
particle size, wall thickness, range in color of paste and finish and rim
and surface treatment. The usual absence of temper protrusion in
Jornada Brown may well have been due to a greater care exercised in
finishing and to the smaller sized temper materials used. Both types
occur together but less often in the more northern and southern
Jornada-Mogollon sites. The dissimilarities of the two types might
primarily have been a result of a difference in the available pottery
making materials.
El Paso and Jornada Brown are considered ancestral to E1 Paso
Polychrome (Lehmer 1948) and this was readily observed in the
GMNP sample, since E1 Paso Polychrome sherds varied so greatly in
appearance. The transition from brown to polychrome was evidenced
in the E1 Paso area by the existence of El Paso and Jornada Red on
Brown and Black on Brown (Gerald n.d.; Lehmer 1948). E1 Paso
Polychrome was a widely distributed type that has been found in sites
as far east as Garza County, Texas (Shedd 1968), in southwest New
Mexico and southeast Arizona (Mills 1971, 1972), south into northern
Chihuahua, Mexico (Phelps 1968a) and northward into central New
Mexico (Stallings 1936). The most recently published dates for E1
Paso Polychrome, A.D. 1260-1295, were derived from archaeomagnetic samples taken from fire hearths in an E1 Paso site in the
Hueco Basin (Brook 1970).
Characteristics such as temper materials, size, paste and finish were
frequently duplicated in sherds of El Paso Brown and E1 Paso Polychrome and in Jornada Brown and E1 Paso Polychrome (Mera 1943;
Lehmer 1948; Stallings 1931; Hawley 1950). E1 Paso Polychrome,
which lacked decoration due to weathering or because of sherd size,
was often extremely difficult to identify in the GMNP collection.
Considerable care had to be exercised in differentiating E1 Paso
Polychrome from either E1 Paso or Jornada Brown. Two characteristics, wall thickness and rim treatment, were used in lieu of (when
decoration was missing), and in addition to, painted surfaces. In the
former case El Paso Polychrome was usually thinner and in the latter
instance it exhibited a wider range of rim forms (Stallings 1931; Alves
1931; Lehmer 1948; Mera 1943). The three pottery types, E1 Paso and
Jornada Brown and E1 Paso Polychrome, were designated as indigenous to the Jornada-Mogollon by Lehmer (1948).

The great spatial and temporal distribution of E1 Paso and Jornada
ware can probably be attributed to their function within the culture.
The wide range of forms found in E1 Paso and Jornada ceramics
(Lehmer 1948; Moore 1947; Gerald n.d.) suggests that E1 Paso and
Jornada pottery was used in a variety of tasks, and therefore the two
types endured for a considerable length of time. Also, since they were
adaptable to so many functions, E1 Paso andJornada ware could have
been and were accepted in regions quite distant from their origin.
The most prevalent intrusives in E1 Paso area Jornada-Mogollon
sites (Moore 1947; Brook 1965; Lehmer 1948) were Playas Red (this
term was used, rather thanPlayas Red Incised, in accordance with the
1969 Ceramic Conference in Dragoon, Arizona; the conference actually updated rather than changed the Playas Red series originally
recognized by Sayles [1936]), Alma Plain, Mimbres Black on White,
Chupadero Black on White, Lincoln Black on Red, Three Rivers Red
on Terra Cotta (to include the broadline variety which was classified
as San Andres Red on Terra Cotta by McCluney), Ramos Polychrome,
Gila Polychrome (Hawley 1950) andAgua Fria Glaze (Hawley 1950).
Of the above ceramic types, only the latter two were not identified in
the GMNP sherd sample. The two Chihuahua or Casas Grandes wares,
Escondido Polychrome and Casas Grandes Rubbed Scored, that were
found in the GMNP have not been reported from any JornadaMogollon sites. These two types might well have been present in the
E1 Paso region but were misidentified since formal descriptions of
Escondido Polychrome and Casas Grandes Rubbed Scored probably
did not appear until 1970 (Ceramic Conference 1969).
A very significant aspect of the GMNP sherd sample was the fact
that virtually 90% of the ceramics recovered were of wares either
native to or common intrusives in the Jornada-Mogollon. It was quite
interesting to note that 100% of the ceramic artifacts in the park
collection were also so disposed.
Until recently many of the pottery types in the Middle Pecos Valley
had not been descriptively typed, nor had the spatial and chronological relationships of all the Middle Pecos Valley ceramics been substantiated. Jelinek accomplished both tasks and published his findings in 1967. He identified and presented formal descriptions of six
new pottery types from the Middle Pecos Valley: Middle Pecos
Micaceous Brown, McKenzie Brown, South Pecos Brown, Roswell
Brown, Crosby Black on Gray and Middle Pecos Black on White.
Jelinek (1967) indicated that the new types were indigenous to the
Middle Pecos Valley: Middle Pecos Micaceous and McKenzie Brown
and Middle Pecos Black on White to a northern area and the remainder to a southern area centered about Roswell, New Mexico. He also

GUADALUPE CERAMICS

141

suggested thatSouth Pecos Brown was native to a much larger region,
perhaps as far south as the Texas-New Mexico border. All of these new
pottery types, except the Middle Pecos Black on White, were a part of
the GMNP survey sample.
Intrusives in the Middle Pecos Valley came from diverse regions
butJornada Brown, Alma Plain, Chupadero Black on White and Red
Mesa Black on White were the most frequent (Jelinek 1967); of these
only Red Mesa Black on White was missing in the GMNP sherd
collection. Jornada Brown represented a very substantial portion of
the intrusives in the Middle Pecos Valley, especially during the earliest phases, and was in fact the dominant pottery type in Jelinek’s
(1967) Early 18 Mile Phase. Jornada-Mogollon ceramic types provided the bulk of intrusives in the Middle Pecos Valley even though E1
Paso wares, considering the amount of Jornada Brown present, were
conspicuous by their very limited occurrence. Chupadero Black on
White was easily the most common reduced fire intrusive in the
Middle Pecos Valley and the same situation was found to have existed
in the GMNP. Three Rivers and San Andres Red on Terra Cotta,
Mimbres Black on White and St. John’s Polychrome were other intrusives common to both the Middle Pecos Valley and the GMNP. Numerical calculation determined that approximately 18% of the GMNP
sherds represented ceramic types that were either native to or intrusive in the Middle Pecos Valley ceramic series.
The apparent lack of Middle Pecos Black on White in the park was
worthy of note since it was the dominant pottery type in the two latest
Middle Pecos Valley ceramic phases, excluding the intrusive
Chupadero Black on White in the Post McKenzie phase (Jelinek 1967).
Middle Pecos Black on White might have been present in the park but
was inadvertently identified as Crosby Black on Gray and Chupadero
Black on White. Presently, no Middle Pecos Valley ceramics have
been conclusively identified in any of the E1 Paso area JornadaMogollon sites. Hedrick (1968) reported unknown brown ware sherds
(Middle Pecos Valley derivation?) associated with E1 Paso Brown and
Polychrome and Chupadero Black on White in the vicinity of Van
Horn, Texas.
The valley of the Pecos River in the vicinity of Carlsbad, New
Mexico, the eastern slopes of the Guadalupe Mountains and southeastern New Mexico were referred to as the Carlsbad District by Burns
(1967). He and Riches (1970) conducted archaeological research in
the region in an effort to define the local prehistoric assemblages and
to establish cultural relationships between the district and other
groups. They studied the available sources pertaining to the open

142

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

sites of the district and both made independent surveys within the
area.
Riches (1970) reported that the pottery associated with the open
sites indicated a relation to the Jornada-Mogollon. The ceramic types
Riches identified were primarily Jornada Brown, E1 Paso Brown, E1
Paso Polychrome, Chupadero Black on White and Three Rivers Red
on Terra Cotta. Her assemblage compared favorably with the GMNP
sample but it did not include some of the pottery types consistently
intrusive to the E1 Paso Jornada-Mogollon nor did it contain any
identified Middle Pecos Valley wares.
Burns’ (1967) sherd collection was even more closely associated
with the E1 Paso Jornada-Mogollon since he discovered, in addition to
the above ceramic types, Mexican (Ramos Polychrome, Villa
Ahumada Polychrome and Playas Red) wares, Alma Plain and St.
John’s Polychrome in the open sites of the district. He concluded that
the pottery of the Carlsbad District was basically Jornada-Mogollon.
His ceramic collection was also very similar to that of the park and he,
as Riches, did not have access to Jelinek’s (1967) publication on the
Middle Pecos Valley.
Neither Burns nor Riches found any evidence of Plains ceramics
during their prospective surveys as had Greer (1968) during his work
east of the Pecos River in the Carlsbad area. Vivian (1969) noted that
Plains influence at Gran Quivira, a ruin approximately 250 kilometers
west of the GMNP, was rather scanty and quite late in time. No
ceramic evidence of Plains culture was discovered in the park during
the survey but this does not preclude some form of contact between
the peoples of the Plains and those of the GMNP.
Design elements were difficult and motifs almost impossible to
identify considering the small size of most of the GMNP sherds and
the weathering to which they had been exposed. The elements that
were distinguishable did not differ from those noted for the various
pottery types in other works (Lehmer 1948; Moore 1947; Ceramic
Conference 1969; Hawley 1950; Alves 1931; Jelinek 1967; Gerald n.d.;
Moore and Wheat 1951). This indicated that the patterns would
likewise be similar. Vessel shapes, other than differentiating between
ollas and bowls, could not be determined with any certainty. The
great majority of the decorated sherds were found to be pieces of ollas.
The undecorated sherds from which a determination could be made
were also predominantly olla fragments. The existence of the salt beds
on the western edge of the survey area offers a tentative explanation
for the preponderance of olla sherds. Boiling large amounts of water
for salt extraction could be better accomplished with ollas than with
bowls since the bowls in the GMNP were apparently small; bowl

GUADALUPE CERAMICS

143

sherds in the GMNP collection were found to have been parts of small
vessels. Further, neither Jelinek {1967} nor Lehmer {1948) identified
large bowls in the Middle Pecos Valley or in the Jornada-Mogollon.
Rim sherds appeared infrequently in the GMNP collection, but a
variety of rim forms was represented. A direct method was most
common among the brown wares and some beveling was evident. The
rim forms of the ceramic types in the GMNP sample were more varied
but neither they nor the GMNP brown wares differed from previously
noted forms for corresponding pottery types in other publications
(Moore 1947; Moore and Wheat 1951; Lehmer 1948; Ceramic Conference 1969; Jelinek 1967; Gerald n.d.).
Temper materials observed in the GMNP sherds were basically the
same as those elements listed by others for the represented ceramic
types {Hawley 1950; Moore and Wheat 1951; Jelinek 1967; Lehmer
1948; Ceramic Conference 1969; Riches 1970). Tempering agents
were readily available in the park since the Guadalupe Mountains are
composed of Permian limestones (Newell 1953) and gypsum and
quartz granules are abundant in the park dunes (Burns, personal
communication). Other temper materials, such as mica and feldspar,
might have been introduced into the park from outside areas (Burns,
personal communication 1972). Deposits of the above mentioned
temper agents were not located during the TAS survey (Runyan ms.),
however, a discussion of the availability of tempering material becomes superfluous if all the GMNP ceramics are considered intrusive.
Approximately 30% of the collected sherds were decorated by
painting or texturing, but it should be emphasized that some plain
sherds might well have been fragments of decorated vessels. The
percentage of painted and textured wares was greater in the Intermediate and greatest in the Late ceramic phase sites. This paralleled
the relatively standard pattern of a decreasing prominence of plain
wares observed by Lehmer (1948) in the ]ornada-Mogollon and by
Jelinek (1967) in the Middle Pecos Valley, with the McKenzie Brown
modification in the latter area as previously noted. Painting was by far
the prevalent method of decorating pottery, as there were actually few
textured sherds in the park sample. This was in keeping with the
treatment of pottery practiced by the E1 Paso area Jornada-Mogollon
peoples (Lehmer 1948). They had no great amount of locally manufactured textured ware other than the occasional E1 Paso and Jornada
textured pottery and a black smugged corrugated ware. The latter,
none of which was discovered in the GMNP, was usually found in the
western-most E1 Paso area Jornada-Mogollon sites and was attributed
to the Mimbres peoples (Moore 1947; Lehmer 1948). Previously re-

144

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

ported E1 Paso and lornada textured sherds usually composed less
than one percent of the total ceramics (Lehmer 1948).
Jelinek (1967) listed only Roswell Corrugated and McKenzie
Incised, both variants of their respective types, as textured wares
native to the Middle Pecos Valley. Neither were abundant in the
Middle Pecos Valley and both were absent in the park. Roswell Corrugated, McKenzie Incised, Pitoche Rubbed-ribbed and Jornada Corrugated appeared for the first time in quantity during the latest phases in
the Middle Pecos Valley (Jelinek 1967), but only the latter was present
in the GMNP. Red decoration, primarily lines and wash, seemed to
have occurred more frequently on Middle Pecos Valley brown wares
than on E1 Paso or Jornada Brown (Gerald n.d.; Jelinek 1967; Lehmer
1948). Such a condition was also found to exist in the park.
Runyan (ms.) speculated that salt extraction was a late development
in the GMNP but present evidence indicates otherwise. Early, Intermediate and Late ceramic sites were scattered throughout the survey
area. Seven (70%) of the sites classified as large were situated near the
lake bed and of those, two are Early ceramic phase, three are Intermediate and two are Late ceramicphase. The remaining sites near the
lake bed were varied in size and phase category. Early ceramic sites
were in most cases small and relatively scattered while later sites
tended to be geographically more closely allied. If the sites were
occupied simultaneously, these conditions suggest a gathering of
groups progressively closer to one another.
Sites containing certain pottery types were examined in relation to
their gross geographica! location within the park. Those pottery types
considered critical in an attempt to establish any ceramic influx
patterns were Mexican sherds, pottery types from eastern Arizona and
western New Mexico, and the Rio Grande-northern New Mexico
ceramics. No extraordinary spatial or temporal patterns were discovered, since neither the pottery types native to the Jornada-Mogollon
nor these native to the Middle Pecos Valley were considered to be key
indicators in the above instance. Had they been used, the obvious
ceramic influx patterns would have been from the west and northeast
throughout the time span of the occupation of the GMNP by ceramic
possessing peoples.
Another pattern that developed, or rather was negatively derived,
concerned the absence of defensively arranged sites and the small
number of sites that could be considered as being defensively located.
Although the hill sites might have offered some measure of security,
the degree of safety that could have been obtained would have been
marginal and questionable. Canyon sites, speculating that the inhabitants of the park were basically sedentary, would have invited

GUADALUPE CERAMICS

145

disaster rather than provided defense. This latter point is debatable
but the very small size of canyon sites indicated that if they were
indeed located for defense, only a minute portion of the total population received or was interested in safety. It could be argued that the
western GMNP sites, those near the playa that could be considered
contemporary, were arranged for mutual defensive support. But the
theory that they were situated closely to one another to achieve a more
responsive labor force seems more plausible.
Apparently the prehistoric inhabitants of the park preferred the
lower altitudes for settlement; perhaps because of their relative flatness within the generally rugged terrain of the GMNP, their proximity
to salt deposits, and the presence of sandy areas in which horticulture
could be practiced (Brad field 1971; Burns, personalcommunication).
The few sites that were situated in the Upper Sonoran life zone were
small and, as suggested by their diminutive size, temporary habitations.
The location of an overwhelming majority of sites on alluvial fans
and flats also suggests a possible concentration for horticultural purposes. Nevertheless, actual evidence of such a subsistence pattern
was extremely rare in the Guadalupe Mountains-Carlsbad District
area and was defined solely from cave sites (Burns 1972; Riches 1970).
Jelinek (1967) speculated that horticulture was practiced in the Middle Pecos Valley and Burns (personal communication), despite the
lack of specific evidence, believed that corn fi~i:ming was practiced in
the Carlsbad and Crow Flats areas. The only evidence’of corn within
the Carlsbad district was discovered in a cave in the southern
Guadalupe Mountains (Riches 1970).
It could be inferred from the large number of sites located on the
fringes of the playa that the inhabitants of the GMNP exploited the
presence of both resident and migrant birds. The lake probably contained sufficient permanent water during the prehistoric era (Burns,
personal communication) to have provided an attractive habitat for
bird life. The Crow Flats section is well within the limits of the central
American flyway for migratory birds (Zim and Gabrielson 1966). The
hunting of fowl was most likely a supplementary rather than the
primary subsistence system of the prehistoric park inhabitants.
Strong ceramic evidence, particularly the fact that very nearly 90%
of the GMNP sherds were of a Jornada-Mogollon type or types commonly intrusive to the Jornada-Mogollon, argues well for the extension of the Jornada-Mogollon into the GMNP survey area. Corley
(1966) proposed an eastern extension of the Jornada-Mogollon of at
least 150 miles. This later theory was supported by Burns (personal
communication) but branded by Riches (1970) as being unjustifiable

146

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

on the basis of current evidence (Riches found no evidence of corn
cultivation or sedentary villages in the open sites). Greer (1968) suggested a subdivision of the Jornada in the area east of the Guadalupe
Mountains based upon pottery collected and the listed radiocarbon
dates; he was mute concerning the actual mountain area but implied
by omission that the Guadalupe Mountains were a part of the principal Jornada-Mogollon cultural district.
The apparent lack of Middle Pecos Black on White and the small
amount of McKenzie Brown in the GMNP sample indicated a termination of contact with the Middle Pecos Valley during or shortly following Jelinek’s (197) Early McKenzie phase (A.D. 1250). The restricted
number of late pottery types and the absence of Gila Polychrome in
the park implied a discontinuance of activity between the park inhabitants and the E! Paso area Jornada-Mogollon during the middle
years of Lehmer’s (1948) E1 Paso-San Andres phase (A.D. 1200 to A.D.
1400). Both these conditions, coupled with the lack of Glaze wares in
the GMNP, suggested that the abandonment of the park by the ceramic
possessing peoples began sometime during the early- to mid-14th
century.
The presence of E1 Paso Brown, Jornada Brown, Middle Pecos
Micaceous Brown and South Pecos Brown in the GMNP collection
reasonably confirmed an A.D. 850+ date for the inception of ceramics
in the park. This date was determined by comparing and contrasting
the opening ceramic phase of the Jornada-Mogollon (Lehmer 1948)
with that of the Middle Pecos Valley (Jelinek 1967).
Based exclusively upon correlation of pottery types, the GMNP was
occupied by ceramic using peoples during the period A.D. 850-1350.
A possibility exists that the park was inhabited by pottery possessing
peoples into the 16th century, since Chupadero Black on White
remained in usage until that time (McGregor 1965); the remainder of
the ceramic types represented in the GMNP sample had disappeared
by the middle of the 14th century (Breternitz 1966; Hawley 1950;
Ceramic Conference 1969). However, Breternitz (1966) revealed that
the best trade period for Chupadero Black on White was the 14th
c entury, and imp lied that the typ e p ersisted into th e 16th century only
in central New Mexico. Additionally, Vivian (1964) indicated that the
latest Chupadero Black on White, or Tabira Black on White as he
termed it, was quite restricted in areal distribution.

SUMMARY
Ceramic evidence indicates that the surveyed area of the GMNP was
occupied during the period A.D. 850-1350 by people who were prob-

GUADALUPE CERAMICS

147

ably Jornada-Mogollon or by an unidentified group who depended
largely upon the Jornada-Mogollon for their pottery and/or ceramic
technology. Evidence of interaction with the Middle Pecos Valley
peoples was also very apparent in the GMNP. The prehistoric occupants of the GMNP received some ceramics from great distances,
judging from the assumed origin of some of the sherds recovered
during the survey. A great volume of ceramic trade was evidently not
conducted since sherds other than those of Jornada-Mogollon and
Middle Pecos Valley derivation comprised only a fraction of the total
park collection. There were no extraordinary ceramic trade patterns
discernable.
There was suggestive evidence that a distinctive attraction of the
GMNP region was the existence of vast and exploitable salt deposits.
Whether the inhabitants took seasonal advantage of the salt potential
or were permanent residents could not definitely be established. No
evidence of a predisposition toward defense was discovered, and the
GMNP inhabitants obviously preferred the lower altitudes and generally settled on the flats and alluvia! fans.
How the residents sustained themselves remains a matter of conjecture. Using the Jornada-Mogollon as a model it is likely that hunting
and gathering dominated the earlier stages of occupation and that
horticulture, presupposing a relatively sedentary existence based
upon the amount of ceramics present, supplemented by hunting and
gathering, pre-empted the original life style. Neither a sedentary nor
nomadic existence for the occupants of the GMNP is presently demonstrable, nor is horticulture as opposed to hunting and gathering
manifested by the ceramic evidence.

I wish to take this opportunity to thank Barney J. Burns for the extremely valuable
technical assistance he provided. His efforts, entirely by correspondence, made possible the incorporation of the latest data from the Carlsbad district into this report. Dr.
Harry J. Shafer, a sympathetic yet nonpatronizing individual, was my editorial guiding
light in this endeavor. He never lost faith in me and my attempts to transfer my
thoughts, which often approached incoherency, onto paper. He appreciated my long
absence from "things" archaeological and, with Barney J. Burns, continually encouraged me.
I am especially grateful to two other people, Thomas H. Naylor and my wife. Thomas
was particularly instrumental in bringing this undertaking to its conclusion. He advised and cajoled, pressured and insisted, and was truly a valuable mentor.
Had it not been for the tireless effort of my wife, Kitty, this report might never have
been finished. She did a great deal of typing and suggested organizational techniques.
She never faltered in her support of me during the many hours of work devoted to this
paper. To her I extend a very special "thank you."
