Abstract
On August 27, 2014, an intensive cultural resources survey was conducted, and on October
7, exploratory backhoe trenching was conducted prior to the construction of the proposed
Sorento Wastewater Interceptor in the City of Pflugerville, Travis County, Texas. The 15­
acre Area of Potential Effect (APE) was a 100-foot-(30-meter)-wide easement for 6,569
linear feet of proposed waste water line. The proposed line begins immediately north of the
future site of the Carmel-Sorento lift station and terminates near the proposed Sorento
subdivision, just north of Jesse Bohls Road (Figures 1 and 2). The width of the proposed
pipe ranges from 36” along the southern portion of the line to 21” from the northernmost
creek crossing to the northern end of the line along Jesse Bohls Road.
This work was conducted in compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC
26.20[2]) under Texas Antiquities Code permit number 6989 as well as Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, for compliance with Section 404
of the Clean Water Act for any impacts to US Army Corps of Engineers regulated waters.
The pedestrian survey did not result in the location of any new archeological sites or
historic structures. Based on these results, no further archeological work is recommended.
Records from this investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory. Julie Shipp served as Principal Investigator on this project.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
The City of Pflugerville is proposing to construct 6,569 linear feet (2 kilometers) of new
waste water line in order to provide sewer service for the proposed Sorento residential
development. The 15-acre Area of Potential Effect (APE) will be a 100-foot- (30-meter-)
wide easement for the length of the proposed wastewater line.
The proposed line will start immediately north of the future site of Carmel/Sorento lift
station and terminate near the proposed Sorento subdivision, just north of Jesse Bohls
Road (Figures 1 and 2). The width of the proposed pipe ranges from 36” along the
southern portion of the line to 21”, from the northernmost creek crossing to the northern
end of the line along Jesse Bohls Road. A maximum depth less than 30 feet (9 meters)
will be maintained, allowing for open-cut construction methods. Feasibility of
constructing the creek crossing with open-cut methods will be further evaluated during
the design phase.
This investigation consists of an intensive archeological survey of the proposed Sorento
wastewater interceptor pursuant to the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]) as
well as Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, for
compliance with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act for any impacts to US Army Corps
of Engineers regulated waters. The overall investigation includes pedestrian survey,
photography, subsurface testing (backhoe trenching), site recording, basic archival
research and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL) eligibility assessment, data analysis, and report preparation in
accordance with THC and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) standards.
No new archeological sites or isolated finds were recorded.

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1 Environmental Setting
The proposed project area lies within the Blackland Prairie subprovince of the Gulf
Coastal Plains Physiographic Region, which lies below and to the south and east of the
Balcones Escarpment and is characterized by deep, dark, fertile soils (BEG 1996). The
proposed project is within the Colorado River Basin approximately 20 miles (32
kilometers) to the north of the Colorado River. The local topography consists of very
gently rolling hills and low gradient tributaries of Wilbarger Creek. Portions of the land
comprising the proposed project area have been used recently for cropland. The areas
which have been previously cleared for agriculture slope gradually toward the wooded
swath of land along the tributary of Wilbarger Creek. The surrounding area is primarily
agricultural and residential. The APE is located at the confluence of two tributaries to
Wilbarger Creek.
2.2 Soils
The soils within the APE are mapped as Tinn, Heiden, and Houston Black clays (Figure
3) (Werchan et al. 1974). These soils are Vertisols, which have a high clay content that
can cause significant cracking from the shrinking and swelling of the soil. Tinn clay is
Holocene alluvium, which is a deposit that has a high potential to contain archeological
sites. Heiden and Houston Black clay are in situ soils weathered from alkaline marine
clay shale. The soils formed on erosional uplands; thus the probability of archeological
sites and the likelihood of intact cultural deposits in these soils is low.
2.3 Geology
The surface geology is mapped as Quaternary alluvium along the tributaries to Wilbarger
Creek and as the Navarro Group in the uplands. The Navarro Group is a Cretaceous-age
formation that consists of mostly silty, calcareous clay with sandstone beds and
concretionary masses near the top and some interbeds of sandstone near the base of the
upper 250 feet (76 meters). The lower 200 feet (60 meters) consists of quartz sand, fine
grained, silty, locally calcareous concretions in discontinuous beds, is light gray, and
contains marine megafossils (Barnes 1974).

3.0 REGIONAL HISTORY AND CULTURE CHRONOLOGY
3.1 Prehistoric Background
The proposed project area falls within the Central Texas archeological region (Collins
1995). Prehistoric archeological sites in Central Texas represent continuous human
occupation starting around 11,500 years ago. Michael B. Collins (1995) authored a
synthesis of Central Texas archeology in which he divides the prehistory of Central Texas
into three periods: (1) the Paleoindian, (2) the Archaic, and (3) the Late Prehistoric. Each
of these is further divided into subperiods, such as early and late. Dates are presented as
Before Present or BP in Table 1.

The Paleoindian period dates between approximately 11,500 and 8,800 BP (Collins
1995:381-3). The Early Paleoindian in Central Texas is part of a larger, regional cultural
horizon, the Clovis horizon. Clovis sites record a general hunter-gatherer lifeway based
upon a wide variety of fauna including large herbivores as well as smaller animals.
Evidence of plant resources is less common, but it is presumed that local flora were also
important to subsistence. In contrast, later Folsom sites indicate a greater reliance upon
big game hunting. The Late Paleoindian seems transitional between the Paleoindian and
Archaic in that burned rock features are present, but they are not as large or ubiquitous as
those associated with the Archaic. Other artifacts, features, and faunal remains seem
more similar to those found later in the Archaic.
Archaic sites in Central Texas are most often associated with the use of heated rock in
hearths, ovens, middens, and scatters (Collins 1995:383-385). The period as a whole is
defined by the intensified use of local resources and diversity of material culture in
comparison to the Paleoindian period. The climate ranged from mesic (relatively moist)
in the Early Archaic and the later part of the Late Archaic and xeric (relatively dry)
during the Middle Archaic and beginning of the Late Archaic. Subsistence during mesic
times is centered on the live-oak savanna while a shift in emphasis toward xerophytes
may have occurred during xeric intervals.
The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups, primarily from
the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics into the archeological
6

record takes place in the region during this time as well. The movement of Europeans
inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended the prehistoric era.
3.2 Historic Background
Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca and the remaining survivors of the Narvaez expedition were
the first Europeans known to have set foot in modern-day Texas; they landed on the
Texas coast following a shipwreck in 1528 (Chipman 1992). Between 1528 and the late
1600s, Spanish excursions into Texas were limited. The first European known to enter
Travis County was Domingo Terán de los Ríos during a reconnaissance tour. Later
Spanish incursions recorded insightful information on various Native American tribes,
collectively referred to as the Coahuiltecans, who at one point lived in the area around
modern-day San Antonio. Late-seventeenth-century accounts describe these people as
family units of hunter gatherers that resided near streams and springs, in areas conducive
to nut harvesting. These camps were revisited on a seasonal basis, allowing interaction
with different groups along the way as well as the hunting of bison in open grassland
settings (Campbell 1983; Hester 1989). By the eighteenth century, the cultural integrity of
these native groups was significantly compromised by European settlers and invasive
neighboring Native American groups, such as the Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache, made
possible through access to European horses. Efficiently skilled Comanche horsemen, in
turn, displaced the Lipan Apache culture, continuously raiding European and Native
American settlements alike in Central Texas (Hester 1989).
Population in the area was relatively low during the Spanish colonial period; however,
this changed after Mexican Independence in 1821. Central Texas saw a large influx of
immigration from the southern United States from 1825 to 1835 as the Mexicans granted
land for several small colonies on the Texas frontier (Marks 2010).
Anglo-American settlement in the area began with numerous land grants from Mexico
following its independence from Spain in 1821. Stephen F. Austin established the first
European settlement in what is now Bastrop County when he received a land grant in
1827; some of the settlers of his colony founded the town of Mina, now known as
Bastrop, in 1830 (Marks 2010). Settlement associated with that colony spread into the
area that is now Travis County, and in 1840 the town of Waterloo (now Austin) was
chosen as the location for the capital of the Republic of Texas (Smyrl 2012b).
Mirabeau Lamar, while serving as President of the Republic of Texas, wanted to locate a
site where a new capital city for Texas could be planned, based on the layout of
Washington D.C. at the time. While hunting buffalo with a Ranger detachment in 1838,
Lamar camped at the small settlement of Waterloo at the confluence of Shoal Creek and
the Colorado River. The ambience of the location impressed Lamar, and the site was
chosen over Mina (Bastrop) as the new capital of Texas. The new capital of Waterloo
was renamed after Stephen F. Austin in 1839. Travis County was named after William
Barret Travis, who perished defending the Alamo in 1836. Texas prospered as an
independent republic for ten years, eventually joining the United States in 1845. The
Civil War proved detrimental to Austin’s economy, but conditions improved during the
1880s, particularly with the arrival of various rail roads (Smyrl 2012b).

7

In the mid-nineteenth century, cotton and corn farming and sheep and cattle ranching
were the principal industries in the area. As the site of the state capital, Austin attracted
businesses and population and grew faster than surrounding towns. The Civil War and
Reconstruction impacted Travis County as they did much of the South, with racial tension
and economic disruption (Smyrl 2012b).
Pflugerville, named for a German immigrant who moved to the area in 1849, did not
develop into a town until the 1870s, and it did not have a post office until 1893. The
town’s population remained under 300 until the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas railroad line
between Austin and Georgetown was completed; the tracks passed near Pflugerville and
brought with them population growth (Smyrl 2010a).
In the 1920s and 1930s, cotton and corn farming gave way to cattle ranching due to
changes in growing conditions and the economic depression of the 1930s. World War II
contributed to the abandonment of farming in the area, as workers were needed at nearby
factories. After World War II the population of Pflugerville, which had grown to over
500, had declined once again to below 400 (Smyrl 2010a). Following the war, the
remaining farmers began to successfully diversify their crops and began growing
sorghum, peanuts, pecans, and watermelons. The next few decades saw the continued
shift from farming to cattle ranching. The growth of the city of Austin beginning in the
1970s has impacted all of Travis County through increasing urbanization, bringing with it
challenges of sustainable development (Smyrl 2010b). During the 1980s new
development in Pflugerville contributed to a population boom, and by the end of the
1980s the population of the city had reached over 4000 (Smyrl 2010a). Pflugerville
continues to grow along with the rest of the Austin area, and by 2000 the city had over
16,000 residents (Smyrl 2010a).
4.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
A literature review of the THC Archeological and Historic Sites databases, historic maps,
and records from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) revealed two
previous sites and two previous surveys within one kilometer of the APE (Figure 4). Sites
41TV2339 and 41TV2453 are both multicomponent, consisting of prehistoric and
historic artifact scatters. They have both been determined ineligible for listing on the
NHRP. Site information is summarized in Table 2.
Site 41TV2339 was recorded for the Clear Springs to Hutto Transmission Line Project by
LCRA archeologists in 2008. This survey crosses the northern end of the proposed
wastewater line, although the site was recorded approximately 1,300 feet (400) meters to
the northeast of the current APE. Site 41TV2453 was recorded for the Carmel-Sorento
Lift Station and Force Main by Cox McLain archeologists in 2014. This site is near the
southern end of the proposed APE, approximately 820 feet (250 meters) to the west. Cox
McLain also conducted a linear survey that begins adjacent to the northern end of the
APE and continues eastward and for which no sites were recorded.

5.0 SURVEY METHOD
The specific tasks for this archeological investigation are listed below:
Task 1: After a review of the current archeological sites data and historical research, a
100% pedestrian survey of the APE was conducted to locate any archeological or
historical sites that may be adversely affected by construction of the wastewater line.
Methods of sub-surface testing consisted of backhoe trenching augmented by shovel
tests.
Task 2: All prehistoric and historic sites encountered were to be recorded and assessed
for eligibility for inclusion on the NRHP or for listing as SALs, and all site forms were to
be submitted to TARL.
5.1 Pedestrian Survey
Survey methods complied with THC/CTA survey standards. A pedestrian survey of the
APE was conducted to locate any archeological or historical sites that may be adversely
affected by construction. Shovel tests were judgmentally placed within the APE in low
probability areas that were not planned for backhoe trenching, and that exhibited
potential for shallowly buried archeological sites and did not have at least 30 percent
ground surface visibility. Shovel tests were one foot (30 centimeters) in diameter and
were dug in 4-inch (10-centimeter) levels to pre-Holocene depths, or up to 3.2 feet (1
meter). All of the material was screened through ¼” hardware cloth or hand sorted if the
clay was too firm to screen.
If buried sites were discovered, a sufficient number of shovel tests or backhoe trenches
would be excavated to delimit the horizontal and vertical extent of the site. Newly
discovered sites are recorded on TexSite Archeological Data Collection forms (digital)
for submittal to TARL. Re-visit TexSite Archeological Data Collection forms are
submitted for sites that have already been recorded. If surface visibility is less than 30
percent at these sites, then a minimum of six shovel tests are executed to delimit site
boundaries. This was a non-collection survey, so any diagnostic artifacts encountered
would have been photographed and measured in the field. Any recorded sites would have
been evaluated for potential significance for NRHP inclusion or SAL listing eligibility.
5.2 Backhoe Trenching
Approximately half of the APE is mapped as Tinn clay (Figure 3), which is a Holocene
alluvium that has a high potential to contain deeply buried archeological sites. The clay is
located within the flood plain of the confluence of two tributaries to Willbarger Creek.
Backhoe trenches were excavated at an average of approximately one every 330 feet (100
meters) within the Tinn soil. More specifically, trenches were dug on either side of the
four stream crossings and at the southern end of the line near the Pfluger Cemetery. An
additional trench or two would be excavated in the event that there were relict landforms
within the flood plain. Trench locations were finalized in the field.

11

The backhoe trenches were 15 feet (4.5 meters) long, 3 feet (1 meter) wide, and 5 feet
(1.5 meters) deep. The trench walls were examined for the presence of cultural material,
and a 3 feet (1 meter) section of the wall of each trench was cleaned and profiled in
detail. Each trench was photographed and the location recorded on a Trimble GeoXT.

12

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
A total of six shovel tests and six backhoe trenches were excavated during two field visits
(Figure 5). The entire APE was pedestrian surveyed on the initial field visit. The backhoe
trenches were excavated on the second field visit.
The pedestrian survey served as a reconnaissance for the identification of locations to
excavate backhoe trenches within the flood plain. A significant amount of vegetation
needed to be cleared before access with a backhoe would be possible. Clearing of
vegetation was coordinated with geotechnical coring in order to minimize impacts.
Three shovel tests were dug on a foot slope on the west side of the tributary to Wilbarger
Creek. The tests are located between BHTs 4 and 5 (see Figure 5). The soil on this
landform is mapped as Heiden clay, but was eroded and more shallow than a typical
Heiden profile. All three shovel tests reached unconsolidated bedrock at about one foot
(30 centimeters) below ground surface. The shovel tests were negative for cultural
material.
The other three shovel tests were dug after the backhoe trenching because we were not
able to gain access to a small peninsula where two backhoe trenches were potentially
going to be excavated. These shovel tests were excavated between BHTs 1 and 2 (see
Figure 5). The water in the stream was too high, and we did not otherwise have access
from the woods on the east side of the creek. Rather, we excavated shovel tests across the
landform at 100-foot (30-meter) intervals. These tests were within Tinn soils and were
deep shovel tests that were terminated at 2.5 feet (80 centimeters) below surface. These
shovel tests were also negative for cultural material.
Six backhoe trenches were excavated within the flood plain on a subsequent field visit. A
40-foot (12-meter) wide swath had been cleared since the first pedestrian survey, creating
better access and good ground surface visibility (Figure 6). The clearing activities appear
to have only minimally disturbed the ground surface. The majority of the proposed line
was essentially resurveyed on the second visit.
No cultural material was located during the pedestrian survey or during the backhoe
trenching.

13

Figure 6: Project ROW, facing south.
6.1 Backhoe Trenching
Backhoe trenches (BHTs) were dug on stream banks where access was available. Two of
the proposed trenches were not excavated because of access issues. The proposed
locations were on a small peninsula surrounded by the Wilbarger Creek tributary, and the
backhoe could not cross the creek, nor was access available for the backhoe from the
east. Therefore, three shovel tests were placed on this landform, at 100-foot (30-meter)
intervals.
The proposed trench near the the southern terminus of the waste water line in the vicinity
of the Pfluger Cemetery was not excavated. One reason was that the location of the
proposed waste water line is approximately 160 feet (50 meters) from the cemetery fence.
Also, the proposed water line was at a lower elevation than the cemetery, on the slope
rather than near the level edge of the landform (Figure 6). BHT 1 was excavated near this
location on the edge of the flood plain.

BHT 1
BHT 1 was located at the south end of the floodplain, near the foot slope of the adjacent
uplands. The test was excavated on the south bank of the southernmost of the four stream
crossings. The Holocene deposits were fairly shallow. At about X inches (85
centimeters) below the surface, there was an apparent unconformity with the alluvium
and the underlying terrace remnant. No cultural material was located as a result of the
excavation of BHT 1.

BHT 2
BHT 2 was located on the north side of the peninsula. The excavation of the trench did
not encounter the rocky surface that was located within BHT 1. This is probably because
the trench was excavated further within the flood plain, where the recent deposits were
deeper. The subsoil, however, was encountered at about the same depth. No cultural
material was located while excavating this trench

BHT 3 was located on a foot slope on the west side of the stream. Unconsolidated
bedrock was fairly shallow, as was the case in BHT 1. These two trenches were on foot
slopes on the west side of the stream, which likely accounts for the uncharacteristically
shallow Tinn series deposits. No cultural material was located while excavating this
trench.

7.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In advance of construction of the proposed Sorento Wastewater Interceptor in the City of
Pflugerville, Travis County, Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a
pedestrian survey in accordance with CTA and THC guidelines. The 15-acre APE was a
100-foot wide (30-meter) easement for the 6,569 linear feet of the proposed wastewater
line. The proposed line begins immediately north of the future site of the Carmel-Sorento
lift station and terminates near the proposed Sorento subdivision, just north of Jesse
Bohls Road. This work was conducted in compliance with Texas Administrative Code
(13 TAC 26.20[2]). No new archeological sites were recorded. Based on these results, no
further archeological work is recommended.
