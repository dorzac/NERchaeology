ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey was undertaken in August and October 2014 and June
2015 by American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) for the City of Lubbock for the
proposed Lubbock Northwest Water Reclamation Water and Wastewater pipelines in the
City of Lubbock, Lubbock County, Texas. Fieldwork was conducted under the auspices of
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 6997 and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA). The pedestrian survey provided complete coverage of the
project area. Subsurface testing was accomplished by means of 80 backhoe trenches and
four shovel tests to intensively test for subsurface cultural deposits. On the west side of
where the proposed pipelines cross Yellow House Canyon is a previously recorded site,
41LU83. This site was recorded by the Lubbock Lake Landmark research project in 1989.
This was recorded as a small historic hearth, with a possible earlier occupation. The
recorder stated that this is a historic hearth of burned caliche and ash with rusted metal, tin
cans, nails, hinges and plastic. The recorder also noted that use was probably within the
last 25 years. The hearth was covered in caliche to protect it. The recorder noted that the
site was to be submitted for nomination (NRHP and/or SAL). No subsurface investigations
were conducted, therefore it is unknown if the purported site had any subsurface cultural
deposits that constitute archaeological site criteria. Based on the archival data, this site
appears to be nothing more than a late twentieth century burn pile or pasture clearing.
However, even though the site recorder believed that the hearth was historic in age,
it appears that most of the site area may have been bulldozed due to ranch road maintenance
and fence line clearing. This area is on private land owned by a trust. A few flakes of flint
were observed and a few scattered pieces of burned rock in the bulldozed ranch road (twotrack). Just below the hill where the slope meets the canyon floor, a small limestone hearth
was located on top of a thin veneer of caliche and sandy clay. The hearth appeared to be
approximately 28 x 45 centimeters in size. Since the hearth was already impacted and
continually impacted by ranch traffic, AAG cleaned the hearth and documented its location
and obtained s ample of matrix from between and underneath the hearthstones in an attempt
to obtain a radiometric date for this feature. Appendix IV presents the calibrated
radiocarbon date of A.D. 990 to 1045, A.D. 1095 to 1120, and A.D. 1140 to 1145 years
B.P., this rendering a known occupation date for this site from the Late Prehistoric time
period.
Based on the location of this hearth, and the surface locations of a few flakes and
burned rock scattered, the site size for the site (41LU83) was extended to include these
areas and the site appears to be at least 20 (north-south) x 126 meters (west-east), and
unknown how far to the north or to the south. Subsequent project access revealed that the
hearth had eroded away from recent flooding since it was located on the surface bedrock
and thin soils. Future investigations should address the northern and southern boundaries
in order to ascertain if any intact cultural deposits are present that could be evaluated for
significance. BHT-58 was excavated on top of the canyon edge where the flakes and
scattered burned rock were observed and there was only 23 centimeters of soil on top of
limestone bedrock.
iii

Many of the areas were bedrock exposure on top of the canyon edge. Down the
slope into the bottom of the canyon, BHT-59 was excavated to a depth of 248 centimeters.
It must be noted that the extensive depths of these soils is a result of extreme erosion and
run-off from the cultivated fields to the north. The erosion pathway was observed and
appeared to be filling up the canyon with re-deposited soils from the canyon edges on top.
This portion of the site does not appear to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP) nor worthy of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL). The area to the south needs further investigation in the future should proposed
impacts occur in that vicinity.
On the east side of the Yellow House Draw a previously recorded site, 41LU73 was
relocated. This recorded archaeological site has no site form data on file. The Texas
Historical Commission Sites Atlas only shows an approximate location and has no site
data. The site size and depth is unknown. Upon extensive surface survey, it appears that
this site is a surficial scatter of historic trash debris dating from the late Nineteenth-Early
Twentieth Century based on the lavender glass, clear glass, brown glass, white ware
ceramics, metal fragments, and wire nails. The site has bedrock exposure and mixed
limestone fragments in a sandy clay. Shove probes proved that soil depth is thin and that
the site is located on the surface. The site either represents an early habitation site that may
have been bulldozed over the edge of the hill or it was a dump site along an old two-track
road through the ranch. This site appears to be 20 (north-south) x 50 (east-west) meters in
site size with the southern boundary unknown as to how far it may extend south of the
ranch fence line where the proposed pipelines will be placed. This portion of the site does
not appear to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
nor worthy of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The area to the south
needs further investigation in the future should proposed impacts occur in that vicinity.
Site 41LU89 was recorded and appeared to be just to the east of the project line at
its eastern most point where it turns to the south towards the Berl Huffman Complex. BHT74 proved that there are some deep soils in this area. However, the area has also been
subjected to a number of impacts including past dragstrip raceway track construction and
later demolition, soil removal based on mounds of soils present (similar to other parts of
the project area such as in Figure 16 near BHT-20), and golf course construction adjacent
immediately to the north. The area where the site was recorded further to the east was
inspected surficially during project area access and no cultural materials were observed, It
appears that this project did not locate any extensions of site 41LU89, therefore it does not
appear that this site was relocated, is located further to the east, and will not be impacted.
Site 41LU5 was recorded previously as the Dune Site consisting of a lithic scatter
and midden purportedly from Paleo-Indian to Late Prehistoric time periods. The site was
recorded in 1973 by Texas Tech University and in 1983 it was designated a State
Archeological Landmark. The surveyors identified a flint flake, burnt caliche concentration
and a bone concentration. They also noted that this may be an old floor based on the
iv

location of the artifacts. The site was recorded as eroding out of the highest eastern terrace
with a sand dune. The current project appears to have transected the very eastern edge of
the site and BHTs 76-78 were excavated to test for the presence of any potentially buried
cultural deposits based on the prior recommendations of the original site recorder. Even
though the soils appeared to be deep, no subsurface cultural deposits were identified and
no surface evidence was observed either. The site boundary as shown on the Sites Atlas
appears to be too far to the east. As previously noted, this appears to be the area of the
extreme eastern edge of the site and it appears that the site in question most likely is further
to the west of the proposed pipeline route, at a higher elevation to the sand dune. There is
also a caliche pit located adjacent to the project area and the area was subjected to soil
removal (for a previous swimming pool) so if there was any eastern extension if the site, it
was probably a surficial site that was removed due to these noted impacts. Any future
impacts in this vicinity or to the west should test the deep soils for any remaining cultural
deposits noted by the previous site recorder.
Site 41LU30 was recorded in 1974 as a prehistoric camp site consisting of â
worked stone and flakesâ. The site was found on a high ridge to the Northeast of 41LU1
(the Lubbock Lake site). No subsurface investigations were conducted, therefore it is
unknown if subsurface cultural deposits exist. The site recorder recommended testing
(Phase II) to ascertain depth of cultural deposits. This site is located in the area where
BHT-80 was excavated. Based on the Sites Atlas plotting, the site is immediately south of
BHT-80 and is located over much of the Berl Huffman Complex (baseball fields). The
City of Lubbock would not allow AAG to use heavy machinery in the vicinity of the Berl
Huffman Complex since they have maintained ballfields and a series of irrigation pipes.
Since the proposed pipeline project will be placed adjacent to the fence line and
through the gravel road area, AAG strategically placed four shovel tests to a depth of 100
centimeters to test for any potential subsurface deposits that may be present since the site
recorder thought the site may be a surficial site with some bone present. All were negative
and no cultural materials were observed or found in any of the subsurface tests. However,
some bone fragments were observed in the extreme northeast corner of the park area,
southeast of BHT-80 (outside of the project area) in a pile of sandy clay that appears to be
scraped or bladed soils that were piled up during ballfield construction. It appears that based
on the extensive ball field construction, irrigation lines and utility lines installed, there does
not appear to be any intact surficial or subsurface cultural deposits to be assessed for
significance. The area along the proposed pipeline area within the previously recorded site
area was not found, therefore, no impact will occur to any cultural deposits in this area.
In conclusion, the field investigation conducted by AAG detected no surficial or
sub-surface archaeological sites or cultural remains other than extensions of sites 41LU73
and 41LU83. Further, the results of backhoe trenching conducted during the investigation
indicate that practically all of the ground surface and varying depths of the project area has
been extensively impacted by prior earth moving activities, road and utility construction,
farming and erosion. This suggests that any surficial remains in the area have likely been
altered or destroyed. There is no evidence to suggest that any significant stratified
v

archaeological deposits, features, or artifacts are present within the boundaries of the
proposed development for the new Northwest Water Reclamation Plant Water and
Wastewater Pipelines. AAG believes that this project should be allowed to proceed and no
archaeological monitoring is considered necessary during construction. No artifacts were
collected, however project data will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Lubbock plans to construct the Lubbock Northwest Water Reclamation
Water and Wastewater Pipelines in the northwest area of Lubbock, Texas. The project area
covers approximately 40,305â (with a 50 foot right-of-way) of water and wastewater lines north
and south of Highway 84 (Clovis Highway), near the junction with Loop 289 in the northwest
side of City of Lubbock, Lubbock County, Texas (Figure 1). Construction impacts are not
expected to exceed 3.5 meters in depth.
Because the construction will impact public land, permitting approval is subject to state
regulations governing the protection of cultural resources. Specifically, the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT) mandates that ground-disturbing activities must be preceded or accompanied by
archaeological investigations conducted by qualified professional archaeologists. Regulations of
the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), the state agency which
administers the ACT, are also applicable to development of the property.
American Archaeology Group LLC was retained by Enprotec/Hibbs and Todd, Inc. on
behalf of the City of Lubbock to conduct an archaeological survey. The investigation was carried
out under the auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit 6997 and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) through a nationwide permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
and was funded by the City of Lubbock through its contract for engineering services with Alan
Plummer and Associates Inc. and Enprotec/Hibbs and Todd, Inc. Fieldwork was conducted in
August and October 2014 and June 2015 which included surface survey and backhoe trenching
to test for potential subsurface cultural deposits. Relief within the project area varies 40 feet from
3,292âto 3,242âfeet above mean sea level. UTM coordinates for the approximate center of the
project area are zone 14S 232354 Easting, and 3725520 Northing located on the Lubbock West
and Shallowater 7.5â USGS Quad Maps.
This report provides archaeological and historical information relevant to the project and
describes the implementation and results of the field investigations. Based on the results of the
investigation, it is recommended that construction of the proposed Northwest Water Reclamation
Plant Wastewater and Water Pipelines be allowed to proceed.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Regional Environment
Geography and Geomorphology
The project area lies within a region known as the Southern High Plains, or Llano
Estacado. An extensive, high plateau, the Llano Estacado covers approximately 82,880 square
kilometers (32,000 square miles) in the western Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico. It is
bounded by escarpments from 50 to 200 meters high on the east, north, and west. The southern
portion grades into the Edwards Plateau (Holliday 1997; Leatherwood 2006).
The formation of the Llano Estacado is tied to a late Cenozoic uplift of the Rocky
Mountains. Beginning nearly eleven million years ago in the Miocene and continuing in the
Pliocene, vast quantities of alluvial and eolian sediments eroded from the mountains spilled into
eastern New Mexico and Texas, creating the Ogallala Formation. Much of Ogallala is covered
by a crust of indurated caliche, known as the Caprock, formed by the evaporation of calcium
carbonate carried in solution from the mountains (Holliday 1997; Leatherwood 2006; Pazzaglia
and Hawley 2004).
Mantling large areas of the Ogallala is another Pliocene deposit, the Blanco Formation.
This formation comprises sequences of lacustrine deposits from lakes formed in subsidence and
deflation basins on the Ogallala surface. Around the beginning of the Pleistocene (~ 1.6 million
years ago), the lakes vanished and the Llano was blanketed by eolian sands from the Pecos River
valley. These sediments constitute the Blackwater Draw Formation, the major surficial deposit
of the Llano (Holliday 1997; Pazzaglia and Hawley 2004).
Basin-like depressions known as playas, dunes, and dry valleys provide slight
topographic relief on the vast plains of the Llano. These features contain most of the intact
assemblages of buried cultural remains in the region and are therefore the focus of most
archaeological research (Holliday 1997). Playas are found throughout the Llano and number
around 25,000. They are typically less than 370 acres (1.5 square kilometers) and average about
17 acres (0.07 square kilometers). Recent investigations suggest that playas are erosional
features and that most formed during the Pleistocene (Holliday et al. 1996; Bolen 2006). In the
past the playas contained water and were both a refuge for wildlife and focus of prehistoric
settlement. Today, they are largely dry. Some contain water from seasonal rains, but it is
generally brackish (Bolen 2006). Dunes, also known as lunettes, are eolian features found
adjacent to playas. Their growth is linked to water levels in the playas, with growth peaking
when low water levels expose lake sediments, the source of the dune deposits (Frederick 1998).
The dry valleys, or draws, of the Llano were once tributaries of the Red, Brazos and Colorado
rivers, and they tend to follow the southeasterly course of these waterways. The draws cut into
the Blackwater Draw Formation and contain Pleistocene and Holocene lacustrine, paludal,
alluvial and eolian deposits (Holliday 1997).

Climate
The present day climate of the Llano Estacado is semi-arid, with long, hot summers and dry
winters. Gradients in precipitation and temperature are relatively uniform across the region;
temperature grades higher from northwest to southeast, and precipitation generally increases
from west to east, averaging 22-23 inches (56-58 centimeters) annually in the east to 14-15 inches
(36-38 centimeters) in the west (Holliday 1997; Leatherwood 2006).
Vegetation
Though today the Llano Estacado is largely under cultivation, potential vegetation is mixedprairie grassland, dominated by the short-grasses blue grama (Poa arachnifera) and buffalo grass
(Buchloe dactyloides). Other native plants include yucca cactus, catclaw and wildflowers
(daisies, buttercups, verbena, and Indian paintbrush). Native trees â cottonwoods and hackberries
â are limited to escarpments and canyons. Mesquite, cedars, Chinese elms, oaks and pines were
introduced historically. The natural vegetation of the Llano remained relatively stable
throughout the Holocene. In the late Pleistocene, when human groups began settling on the
Llano, vegetation varied with changing climatic regimes, ranging from subhumid to semiarid
savanna to semiarid grassland (Graves 2006; Holliday 1997; Samson et al. 1998).
Local Environment
Lubbock County is located on the eastern edge of the Llano Estacado, roughly midway between
its northern and southern boundaries. The county covers an area of 893 square miles (2,313
square kilometers) and comprises primarily flatlands which slope gently to the southeast from a
maximum elevation of 3,400 feet (1,040 meters). As is the case throughout the Llano Estacado,
the flatlands are dotted by playas. Nearly a thousand are present in Lubbock County. In the
southeast corner of county, the North Fork of the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos River
descends the Caprock Escarpment, the eastern boundary of the Llano, leveling out at an elevation
of about 2,900 feet (884 meters) (Graves 2006). A tributary of the North Fork, Yellow House
Draw, passes just north of the project area.
Geology and Soils
The primary surface deposit in Lubbock County is the early Pleistocene Blackwater Draw
Formation (Fisher 1974). In the study area the Blackwater Draw Formation rests unconformably
on the Pliocene/Miocene Ogallala Formation. The Blackwater Draw Formation is a massively
bedded, grayish red, calcareous, silty, sand with caliche nodules. The Ogallala Formation is a
fluvatile sand, silt, clay, and gravel capped by a hard, pisolitic, caliche or calcrete (Barnes 1970).
The Web Soil Survey 1.1 (National Cooperative Soil Survey) depicts 11 soil series in
the project area:

4

Acuff loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, and Estacado clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes. Acuff loam,
0 to 1 percent slopes was formed on plains from loamy eolian deposits. Typical profiles of this
soil series are 0-12 inches loam; 12-80 inches are below sandy clay loam (Blackstock 1979:6-7).
Amarillo fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes is a gently sloping soil located primarily in
uplands. Typical profiles of this soil are a surface layer (0-10 inches) of reddish brown fine sandy
loam; 10-32 inches reddish brown sandy clay loam; 32-40 inches yellowish red sandy clay loam;
40-47 inches reddish yellow sandy clay loam;4780 inches reddish yellow sandy clay loam and
calcium carbonates (Blackstock 1979:8).
Arch loam, 0 to 3 percent slopes is a soil that formed on benches around playas. Typical profiles
of this soil are a surface layer (0-9 inches) of brown loam; 9-17 inches grayish brown sandy clay
loam and calcium carbonates; 17-34 inches brownish gray sandy clay loam with calcium
carbonate concretions; 34-47 inches gay sandy clay loam; 47-80 inches pale brown fine sandy
loam and calcium carbonate nodules (Blackstock 1979:910).
Arents and Pits are areas reshaped by heavy machinery around playas and caliche pits. Clay
lam mixed with mixtures of wood, glass, and plastic are often found (Blackstock 1979:10).
Bippus clay loam, occasionally flooded is a nearly level soil located in drainageways and
outwash fans. Typical profiles of this soil are surface layer (0-30 inches) brown clay loam; 3055 inches brown clay loam; 55-72 inches brown clay loam (Blackstock 1979:12).
Drake clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes is a gently sloping soil on convex sides of low duned
areas on the eastern side of playas. Typical profiles of this soil are a surface layer (0-10 inches)
grayish brown clay loam; 10-60 inches clay loam with calcium carbonates (Blackstock 1979:1213).
Drake clay loam, 3 to 5 percent slopes is a sloping soil on low duned uplands on eastern sides
of playas. Typical profiles of this soil are a surface layer (0-10 inches) grayish brown clay; 1060 inches pale brown clay loam with calcium carbonates (Blackstock 1979-13).
Estacado clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes were formed on plains from calcareous loamy eolian
deposits from the Blackwater Draw formation of Pleistocene age. Typical profiles of this soil are
surface layer (0-16 inches) brown clay loam; 16-26 inches brown clay loam with calcium carbonates;
26-40 inches light brown clay loam; 40-66 inches reddish yellow clay loam with calcium carbonates
(Blackstock 1979:13-14).
Estacado clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes is a gently sloping soil on uplands adjacent to playas.
Typical profiles for this soil are surface layer (0-14 inches) darker brown clay; 14-20 inches brown
clay loam; 20-34 inches yellowish red clay loam; 34-80 inches reddish yellow clay loam with
calcium carbonates (Blackstock 1979:14).

5

Manaker clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes is a sloping soil on uplands along draws and around
playas. Typical profiles for this soil are surface layer (0-8 inches) brown clay loam; 8-15 inches
light brown clay loam with calcium carbonates; 15-32 inches pink clay loam with calcium
carbonates; 32-60 inches reddish yellow clay loam with calcium carbonates (Blackstock
1979:16).
Potter loam, 2 to 12 percent slopes is a gently sloping soil on uplands. Typical profiles for this
soil are surface layer (0-12 inches) grayish brown loam with calcium carbonates; 12-18 inches
white platy caliche; and 18-30 inches white loamy material with caliche fragments (Blackstock
1979:21-22).
All of the soil series in the study area have been disturbed by farming, ranching, road
construction and maintenance, and utility installation; therefore, the likelihood of intact
assemblages of artifacts on the surface or near the surface at the study site is very low.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Cultural Sequence
The history of human settlement on the Llano Estacado and across the greater Texas area
spans over 11,000 years. A chronological framework developed by archaeologists for the
interpretation of Texas history comprises five general temporal periods whose boundaries
correspond to significant cultural and social developments in the region (Nunley 1989:37-46).
These periods and their approximate dates are as follows: 1) Paleoindian (11,500- 8500 before
present [hereafter B.P.]); 2) Archaic (8500-2000 B.P.); 3) Late Prehistoric (1200 B.P. to A.D.
1450); 4) Protohistoric (A.D. 1450-1650); and 5) Historic (A.D. 1650-1940s).
The Paleoindian period begins during the last Glacial and continues into the early
Holocene. The earliest confirmed Paleoindian populations in Texas were small, highly mobile
bands of hunters armed with distinctive fluted âClovisâ projectile points who pursued large, late
Pleistocene mammals, most notably mammoths (Surovell 2000; Turner and Hester 1985;
Waguespack and Surovell 2003). Later Paleoindian populations developed new forms of
projectile points and refined their hunting strategies in response to environmental factors such as
the extinction of the mammoth and other mega mammals. Yet despite these adaptations, they
maintained a lifeway more like that of their predecessors than that of later Archaic populations.
The complete demise of the Pleistocene big-game animals and climate change
accompanying the onset of the Holocene are linked to shifts in stone tool technology, subsistence
pursuits and settlement patterns that define the Archaic period. The Paleoindian-Archaic
transition, like those between succeeding periods, occurred gradually. As the Pleistocene mega
mammals begin to vanish, indigenous populations focused on smaller game and increased their
reliance on local plant foods. With changes in subsistence came new and more diverse stone
toolkits and an increase in tools made of wood and other organic materials. Additionally,
settlements became more stable, and there is evidence for progressively sophisticated cultural
practices, such as systematic burial of the dead (Bousman et al. 2002). Although the Archaic
hunting and gathering lifeway remained relatively stable for thousands of years, archaeologists
are able to define four subperiods (or eras) â Early, Middle, Late and Transitional â based on a
dated sequence of diagnostic projectile points (Turner and Hester 1985:47-49)
The Late Prehistoric period is marked in some areas of Texas, including parts of the
Panhandle, by the introduction of domesticated plant foods such as corn and beans.
Technological innovations such as pottery and the bow and arrow were widely adopted (Nunley
1989:44; Turner and Hester 1985:82).
The Protohistoric period is associated with an incipient European presence in the region.
Protohistoric indigenous populations were the first described in early ethnohistoric accounts.
Often, these accounts reflected only indirect contact. Items of European manufacture are
occasionally found in Protohistoric sites, though in most cases these items were not acquired
directly but through so called down-the-line trading (Nunley 1989:45).
7

The Historic period is characterized by a firm historical record and increasing direct
contact between indigenous and European explorers and settlers. Horses introduced by the
Spanish and European material culture led to profound changes in indigenous cultures.
Eventually, Old World diseases, resettlement and warfare claimed up to 95% of Texas Indians
(Klos 2006). The latter part of the Historic period encompasses the AngloEuropean settlement
of Texas.
Local Archeological and Historical Context
Biessart et al. (1985) place Lubbock and Lubbock County within the Southern High
Plains archaeological region, which contains a total of 31 counties. With an abundance of
archaeological sites containing well-preserved cultural, faunal and microbotanical remains, and
one of the highest concentrations of Paleoindian sites in North America, this region offers
excellent opportunities to study patterns of prehistoric settlement and adaptations through time
(Holliday 1997; Wendorf 1961).
Among the archaeological resources in Lubbock County is one of the most significant
sites of Southern High Plains region, the Lubbock Lake National Historic and State
Archeological Landmark (41LU1; also known as the Lubbock Lake Site). Since 1939 numerous
investigations at this site, located near the project area in Yellow House Draw, have revealed
deeply stratified deposits of cultural remains representing each of the five cultural chronological
periods presented in the preceding section. The site is best known for its Paleoindian
components. They include Clovis and Folsom complex camps and âkill sitesâ where Pleistocene
mammoths, camels, horses, bison were hunted and butchered (Johnson 1977; Johnson and
Holliday 2006).
Native populations occupied the Lubbock County area continuously from the Paleoindian
period through the early Historic period. Throughout the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric
periods, Indians of the Texas Llano were in constant, frequently hostile, contact with New
Mexican puebloan groups (Kenner 1969; Krieger 1946). When the renowned conquistador
Francisco VÃ¡squez de Coronado arrived in the region during his ill-fated 1540 expedition, he
encountered two groups, the Quecheros and Teyas. The former were likely Apache. The Teyas
may have been Apache or the Tejas recorded ethnohistorically in later times (Kenner 1969:7-9).
Some evidence suggests that Coronado may have passed through Yellow House Draw at the
Lubbock Lake site. The first Spanish explorer that can be placed with certainty in Lubbock
County is Father Juan de Salas, who descended the Blackwater Draw to Yellow House Canyon
in 1629. Later Spanish expeditions followed the same route and recorded Lubbock Lake on their
maps as La Punta de Agua (Leatherwood 2006).
Around 1700 the Comanches moved into the Southern Plains from the north, bringing
European horses. A highly mobile group, the Comanches soon dominated most of the Llano
Estacado and lands to the Brazos River in the east (Leatherwood 2006). In the 1800s they became
known as âgun runnersâ for their trade with Mexican Comancheros to the south and west. While
firearms were bartered by both sides, more common was the exchange of Comanche horses and
8

mules for the iron lances and tomahawks, whiskey, coffee and tobacco of the Comancheros
(Griggs 1978:124; Kenner 1969:85-86).
Following the Civil War, buffalo hunters moved into the region and decimated the
enormous herds that once blackened the plains for miles. With their primary food source gone,
the Comanches were forced onto reservations in Oklahoma. Yet reservation life proved
unbearable, and many eventually returned to Texas, led by Chief Quanah Parker. Their stay was
short lived, however. Following a valiant attack on a buffalo hunter settlement at Adobe Walls
in 1874, they were pursued to Palo Duro Canyon by Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie and the 4th
U.S. Calvary. There, the Comanches, along with their Kiowa and Cheyenne allies, were routed
in a surprise attack. The Indiansâ village was burned, and their vast herd of over 1400 horses
was rounded up for slaughter in Tule Canyon. Lacking transportation, possessions and food, the
Comanches resigned to return to the reservation, opening the way for waves of Anglo-American
settlers from the east (Griggs 1978:124-130).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) maintains records on 140 registered
archaeological sites in Lubbock County (RCRI 2014). The majority of these sites are located
along Yellow House Draw and the North Fork of the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos River.
Other sites have been documented around playa lakes throughout the county.
A review of THC records revealed that the current project area had eight previously
recorded sites within or immediately adjacent to the area. To the east, the surface was surveyed
in 1974-1975 in anticipation of the Canyon Lakes Park Project in Yellow House Draw in which
many sites were recorded. In 1976, those sites and adjacent lands were designated as the Canyon
Lakes Archaeological District in the National Register of Historic Places. The district was
subsequently designated as a State Archaeological Landmark (RCRI 2014).
Baugh et al. (2005) surveyed areas immediately south of the southwest portion of the
current project for a proposed Northwest Passage Project that included the construction of roads
and installation of utilities. This area is almost the same as the 1.7 mile proposed water line.
However, the previous survey concentrated its efforts on limited near-surface testing and the
current study tested for deeper potential sub-surface cultural deposits due to the proposed deep
impacts. Baugh et al. (2005:28) recorded one historic archaeological site (41LU133)
immediately south of the project area that consisted of ceramic sherds and glass fragments. The
site was determined to be ineligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and not worthy of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
41LU5 is a previously recorded site called the Dune Site consisting of a lithic scatter and
midden from the Paleo-Indian to Late Prehistoric periods. The site was recorded in 1973 by
Texas Tech University. The surveyors identified a flint flake, burnt caliche concentration and a
bone concentration. They also noted that this may be an old floor based on the location of the
artifacts. The site was recorded as eroding out of the highest eastern terrace with a sand dune. In
1983, the site was designated as a State Archeological Landmark.
41LU30 was recorded in 1974 as a prehistoric camp site consisting of â worked stone
and flakesâ. The site was found on a high ridge to the Northeast of 41LU1 (the Lubbock Lake
site). No subsurface investigations were conducted, therefore it is unknown if subsurface cultural
deposits exist. The site recorder recommended testing (Phase II) to ascertain depth of cultural
deposits.
41LU46 was recorded in 1975 as a lithic scatter with flakes, 1 projectile point tip,
scrapers, and two bullets. No subsurface investigations were conducted, therefore it is unknown
if buried cultural deposits exist. In 1997 the THC (SHPO-State Historic Preservation Officer)
determined this site eligible for the NRHP, based on investigations conducted for the expansion
of the Lubbock County Youth Center facilities, using shovel testing and backhoe trenching. This
new work uncovered 14 new hearth stones and two flakes, âone of which is a Fresno projectile
point baseâ. These materials were found in the western portion of the site and that area was
recommended to be avoided.
10

41LU70 was recorded as a very eroded prehistoric site approximately one meter square.
A number of bone fragments were recovered from a sand dune bank. The site appears to be a
surface deposit due to the fact that a trench was placed at the site with no subsurface cultural
deposits identified. This site was not recommended for the NRHP or SAL designation. Further
action was not recommended due to âheavy useâ by motorcycles and other all-terrain vehicles.
However, no discussions were provided on the past backhoe trench soil profile, and no column
sampling was conducted, i.e. no controlled sampling.
41LU73 is a recorded archaeological site that has no site form data on file. The Texas
Historical Commission Sites Atlas only shows an approximate location and has no site data. The
site size and depth is unknown.
41LU74 is a recorded archaeological site that has no site form data on file. The Texas
Historical Commission Sites Atlas only shows an approximate location and has no site data. The
site size and depth is unknown, therefore we will need to investigate this general area intensively
to enhance our ability to locate any previously identified cultural deposits, and determine their
potential eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy
of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
41LU83 was recorded by the Lubbock Lake Landmark research project in 1989. This
was recorded as a small historic hearth, with a possible earlier occupation. The recorder stated
that this is a historic hearth of burned caliche and ash with rusted metal, tin cans, nails, hinges
and plastic. The recorder also noted that use was probably within the last 25 years. The hearth
was covered in caliche to protect it. The recorder noted that the site was to be submitted for
nomination (NRHP and/or SAL). No subsurface investigations were conducted, therefore it is
unknown if the purported site has any subsurface cultural deposits that constitute archaeological
site criteria. Based on the archival data, this site may be nothing more than a late twentieth
century burn pile or pasture clearing.
41LU89 was recorded as the Kent site. This site was recorded as a Paleo-Indian surface
scatter 40 X 20 meters in size. The recorder recovered and collected a biface midsection that has
been reworked of âpossible Paleo originâ and associated lithic materials. No subsurface
investigations were carried out to determine if any subsurface cultural materials were present.
The recorder did state that a small bone scatter was present. The surface was noted to have
extreme disturbances and erosion. The site had a road going through it and then a crushed caliche
base was placed over it.

PROJECT METHODOLOGY
The project was divided into three phases â archival research, field survey, and report
preparation. The archival research consisted of a check for records of documented sites in the
online âTexas Archeological Sites Atlas,â which is maintained by the Texas Historical
Commission, as well as a review of other literature concerning previous work in the county. The
purpose of the review was twofold - to identify previously recorded sites in the project area and
to compile information relevant to the project from reports of prior archaeological investigations
in the region.
Field Investigation
The field investigation was comprised of a pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching
operations. Fieldwork was conducted in August and October 2014, and June2015. Herbert G.
Uecker was the Principal Investigator and Michael R. Bradle served as the Project Archaeologist
with assistance from David C. Scott, Leroy Forbes, David D. Bradle, and Logan Davis. Mr. Fred
Curnutt, P.E. and vice president of Enprotec/Hibbs and Todd Inc., and Mr. John Turpin, P.E., a
representative of the City of Lubbock met on-site to confirm the boundaries of the project area and
handled issues regarding utility locations.
The survey involved a systematic walkover of the entire project area at 20 meter intervals.
Surface visibility was approximately 50-80% depending on the locality. Surface disturbances
included two track roads, trails, past road construction, erosion, deflation, and bioturbidity.
Eighty backhoe trenches were excavated (Figure 2) at regular intervals throughout the
project area to test for potential subsurface cultural remains. The trenches averaged 3 meters long,
1.5 meters wide and 23 centimeters to 2.83 meters deep with an average depth of 1.28 meters
(Appendix II). All of the trenches were excavated to caliche and Figures 3-6 provide a
representative sample of the soil horizons present to the caliche zone. One wall of each trench was
troweled and visibly inspected for cultural remains. Samples of soil from each trench were
screened through Â¼â hardware cloth in an effort to locate any smaller artifacts or cultural deposits.
Figure 7 is an example of undulating, uneven surface along the project area indicating
prior blading, surface clearance and subsurface disturbances. Figure 8 is representative of the types
of other impacts noted along the project alignment such as at the Berl Huffman Complex in which
the area was bladed down and soil brought in to level the fields, develop gravel roadways and
fence construction. Site 41LU30 was previously recorded in this area and the City of Lubbock
would not allow any backhoe trenching to be conducted in this area, therefore, 4 shovel tests were
excavated along this portion of the project area, all were negative.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
A search of the literature and the THC Sites Atlas revealed that no previous
archaeological sites were previously recorded within the project area. There was one site
recorded near the project area, 41LU6, that appeared to be an isolated prehistoric cache.

Field Investigation
The field investigation involved pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching. Eighty
backhoe trenches were excavated and four shovel tests (see Appendix II). No historic or
prehistoric cultural remains were detected in the trench walls or in excavated matrix,
including matrix samples screened through Â¼â mesh (see Appendix II).
The survey was conducted in segments to better manage the project due to an
extensive amount of impacts, utilities, and access issues. The first segment was a west to
east transect along and in the middle of Ursuline Street (BHT-1 through 16, see Appendix
IIIa,b). Several large water pipes were located and other unknown utilities not identified
by the utility locating services. The pipeline route then turns south along the east side of
North Quaker Avenue. The area between BHT-16 and 48 was not tested due to extensive
utilities located by the utility location services and noted impacts. This area could not be
surveyed due to safety concerns.
The survey was then conducted along a small new road that runs west to east from
North Quaker Avenue to the edge of the right-of-way of Highway 84, across from the
Lubbock Lake Landmark site (41LU1). This area was subjected to extensive subsurface
backhoe trenching to test for any buried cultural deposits due to its proximity to 41LU1.
BHTs 17-35 tested this area (Appendix IIIa,b). There were a number of impacts noted from
past construction and development activities in the area including road construction for the
new Princeton Street and commercial development such as the new Texas Specialty
Hospital. Additional impacts observed were possibly related to the old Highway 84
construction and right-of-way maintenance.
The next segment of the proposed pipeline route surveyed was the extreme
northwest section where the proposed Lubbock Northwest Water Reclamation Water and
Wastewater Plant is planned for construction, on the west side of County Road 1900. The
proposed water and wastewater lines connect at the proposed plant site where Bradle et al.
(2014) surveyed and found no archaeological sites.
The final segment meandered along Kent Street from the junction with County
Road 1900 to the east for approximately one mile where it intersects North Quaker
18

Avenue. Some areas between BHTs 38-42 and BHTs 49-69 were not examined due to
restricted space where the backhoe could not dig due to fences, road pavement, numerous
utilities marked. These areas were inspected and where possible, shovel probes placed.
The entire area along Kent Street has been severely impacted.
The last mile headed further east from the junction of North Quaker Avenue and
Kent Street was the highest probability area along the entire project alignment due to its
proximity and crossing Yellow House Draw. On the west side of where the proposed
pipelines cross Yellow House Canyon is a previously recorded site, 41LU83 (Figures 9 and
10, Appendix IIId). This site was recorded by the Lubbock Lake Landmark research project
in 1989. This was recorded as a small historic hearth, with a possible earlier occupation.
The recorder stated that this is a historic hearth of burned caliche and ash with rusted metal,
tin cans, nails, hinges and plastic. The recorder also noted that use was probably within the
last 25 years. The hearth was covered in caliche to protect it. The recorder noted that the
site was to be submitted for nomination (NRHP and/or SAL). No subsurface investigations
were conducted, therefore it is unknown if the purported site had any subsurface cultural
deposits that constitute archaeological site criteria. Based on the archival data, this site
appears to be nothing more than a late twentieth century burn pile or pasture clearing.
However, even though the site recorder believed that the hearth was historic in age,
it appears that most of the site area may have been bulldozed due to ranch road maintenance
and fence line clearing. This area is on private land owned by a trust. A few flakes of flint
were observed and a few scattered pieces of burned rock in the bulldozed ranch road (twotrack). Just below the hill where the slope meets the canyon floor, a small limestone hearth
was located on top of a thin veneer of caliche and sandy clay (Figure 11). The hearth
appeared to be approximately 28 x 45 centimeters in size. Since the hearth was already
impacted and continually impacted by ranch traffic, AAG cleaned the hearth and
documented its location and obtained s ample of matrix from between and underneath the
hearthstones in an attempt to obtain a radiometric date for this feature. Appendix IV
presents the calibrated radiocarbon date of A.D. 990 to 1045, A.D. 1095 to 1120, and A.D.
1140 to 1145 years B.P., this rendering a known occupation date for this site from the Late
Prehistoric time period.
Based on the location of this hearth, and the surface locations of a few flakes and
burned rock scattered, the site size for the site (41LU83) was extended to include these
areas and the site appears to be at least 20 (north-south) x 126 meters (west-east), and
unknown how far to the north or to the south. Subsequent project access revealed that the
hearth had eroded away from recent flooding since it was located on the surface bedrock
and thin soils. Future investigations should address the northern and southern boundaries
in order to ascertain if any intact cultural deposits are present that could be evaluated for
significance. BHT-58 was excavated on top of the canyon edge where the flakes and
scattered burned rock were observed and there was only 23 centimeters of soil on top of
limestone bedrock.

Many of the areas were bedrock exposure on top of the canyon edge. Down the slope
into the bottom of the canyon, BHT-59 was excavated to a depth of 248 centimeters. It must
be noted that the extensive depths of these soils is a result of extreme erosion and run-off from
the cultivated fields to the north. The erosion pathway was observed and appeared to be filling
up the canyon with re-deposited soils from the canyon edges on top. This portion of the site
does not appear to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
nor worthy of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The area to the south needs
further investigation in the future should proposed impacts occur in that vicinity.
On the east side of the Yellow House Draw a previously recorded site, 41LU73 was
relocated (Figures 12 and 13). This recorded archaeological site has no site form data on file.
The Texas Historical Commission Sites Atlas only shows an approximate location and has no
site data. The site size and depth is unknown. Upon extensive surface survey, it appears that
this site is a surficial scatter of historic trash debris dating from the late Nineteenth-Early
Twentieth Century based on the lavender glass, clear glass, brown glass, white ware ceramics,
metal fragments, and wire nails (Figure 14). The site has bedrock exposure and mixed
limestone fragments in a sandy clay. Shove probes proved that soil depth is thin and that the
site is located on the surface. The site either represents an early habitation site that may have
been bulldozed over the edge of the hill or it was a dump site along an old two-track road
through the ranch. This site appears to be 20 (north-south) x 50 (east-west) meters in site size
with the southern boundary unknown as to how far it may extend south of the ranch fence line
where the proposed pipelines will be placed (Appendix IIIc). This portion of the site does not
appear to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nor
worthy of designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL). The area to the south needs
further investigation in the future should proposed impacts occur in that vicinity.
Site 41LU89 was recorded and appeared to be just to the east of the project line at its
eastern most point where it turns to the south towards the Berl Huffman Complex. BHT-74
proved that there are some deep soils in this area. Figure 15 depicts the current status of the
area near where site 41LU89 had been previously recorded. However, the area has also been
subjected to a number of impacts including past dragstrip raceway track construction and later
demolition, soil removal based on mounds of soils present (similar to other parts of the project
area such as in Figure 16 near BHT-20), and golf course construction adjacent immediately to
the north. The area where the site was recorded further to the east was inspected surficially
during project area access and no cultural materials were observed, It appears that this project
did not locate any extensions of site 41LU89, therefore it does not appear that this site was
relocated, is located further to the east, and will not be impacted.
Site 41LU5 was recorded previously as the Dune Site consisting of a lithic scatter and
midden purportedly from Paleo-Indian to Late Prehistoric time periods. The site was recorded
in 1973 by Texas Tech University and in 1983 it was designated a State Archeological
Landmark. The surveyors identified a flint flake, burnt caliche concentration and a bone
23

concentration. They also noted that this may be an old floor based on the location of the
artifacts. The site was recorded as eroding out of the highest eastern terrace with a sand dune.
The current project appears to have transected the very eastern edge of the site and BHTs 7678 were excavated to test for the presence of any potentially buried cultural deposits based on
the prior recommendations of the original site recorder. Even though the soils appeared to be
deep, no subsurface cultural deposits were identified and no surface evidence was observed
either. The site boundary as shown on the Sites Atlas appears to be too far to the east. As
previously noted, this appears to be the area of the extreme eastern edge of the site and it
appears that the site in question most likely is further to the west of the proposed pipeline route,
at a higher elevation to the sand dune. There is also a caliche pit located adjacent to the project
area and the area was subjected to soil removal (for a previous swimming pool) so if there was
any eastern extension if the site, it was probably a surficial site that was removed due to these
noted impacts. Any future impacts in this vicinity or to the west should test the deep soils for
any remaining cultural deposits noted by the previous site recorder.
Site 41LU30 was recorded in 1974 as a prehistoric camp site consisting of â worked
stone and flakesâ. The site was found on a high ridge to the Northeast of 41LU1 (the Lubbock
Lake site). No subsurface investigations were conducted, therefore it is unknown if subsurface
cultural deposits exist. The site recorder recommended testing (Phase II) to ascertain depth of
cultural deposits. This site is located in the area where BHT-80 was excavated. Based on the
Sites Atlas plotting, the site is immediately south of BHT-80 and is located over much of the
Berl Huffman Complex (baseball fields). The City of Lubbock would not allow AAG to use
heavy machinery in the vicinity of the Berl Huffman Complex since they have maintained
ballfields and a series of irrigation pipes.
Since the proposed pipeline project will be placed adjacent to the fence line and through
the gravel road area, AAG strategically placed four shovel tests (ST1-4, see Appendix II, IIIa,b)
to a depth of 100 centimeters to test for any potential subsurface deposits that may be present
since the site recorder thought the site may be a surficial site with some bone present. All were
negative and no cultural materials were observed or found in any of the subsurface tests.
However, some bone fragments were observed in the extreme northeast corner of the park area,
southeast of BHT-80 (outside of the project area) in a pile of sandy clay that appears to be
scraped or bladed soils that were piled up during ballfield construction. It appears that based
on the extensive ball field construction, irrigation lines and utility lines installed, there does
not appear to be any intact surficial or subsurface cultural deposits to be assessed for
significance. The area along the proposed pipeline area within the previously recorded site area
was not found, therefore, no impact will occur to any cultural deposits in this area.

In conclusion, the field investigation conducted by AAG detected no surficial or subsurface archaeological sites or cultural remains other than extensions of sites 41LU73 and 41LU83.
Further, the results of backhoe trenching conducted during the investigation indicate that
practically all of the ground surface and varying depths of the project area has been extensively
impacted by prior earth moving activities, road and utility construction, farming and erosion. This
suggests that any surficial remains in the area have likely been altered or destroyed. There is no
evidence to suggest that any significant stratified archaeological deposits, features, or artifacts are
present within the boundaries of the proposed development for the new Northwest Water
Reclamation Plant Water and Wastewater Pipelines. AAG believes that this project should be
allowed to proceed and no archaeological monitoring is considered necessary during construction.
No artifacts were collected, however project data will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

26

RECOMMENDATIONS
American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction at the location
for the proposed Lubbock Northwest Water Reclamation Plant Wastewater and Water
Pipelines Project be allowed to proceed. Monitoring during construction by a professional
archaeologist is not considered necessary. However, should any cultural materials be
exposed in any area not discussed in this report, all work in the immediate area must cease
until the situation can be evaluated by American Archaeology Group LLC in consultation
with the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission, the City of Lubbock,
and Enprotec/Hibbs and Todd, Inc.

APPENDIX I: RESEARCH DESIGN AND SCOPE OF WORK

Records Check
Prior to entering the field, American Archaeology Group LLC (A.A.G.) will contact
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, the state
repository for site records on Texas, to determine if previously recorded sites are present
in the project area. This task may be conducted by a personal visit to TARL or by telephone.
The library at A.A.G. is very extensive, especially regarding reports for the project
area region, and much of the archival work can be accomplished in-house. Since A.A.G.
has conducted work in the area, much of the background work has already been
accomplished.
Permit Application
No fieldwork will commence until a permit from the Archeology Division (AD) of
the Texas Historical Commission has been issued. An application for an antiquities permit
will be submitted to AD-THC as soon as A.A.G. receives Notice To Proceed. Normally,
A.A.G. discusses the project with AD personnel before beginning any fieldwork. This is
done to ensure that both parties are in agreement as to the level of work required for this
project.
Survey Methods
The entire project area will be 100% intensively surveyed utilizing the pedestrian
survey method supported by shovel testing and/or augering and examination of eroded and
disturbed areas where cultural materials may be visible on the surface. Herbert G. Uecker
will act as the Principal Investigator. Shovel testing, augering, and backhoe trenching will
meet and exceed the Minimum Survey Standards For Texas established by the THC.
In areas of poor visibility, and environmental settings that have potential for buried
cultural materials, shovel testing will be required and tests will be concentrated in areas of
high site probability and randomly across the project area. All excavated fill will be
screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests will be manually excavated to sterile
clay or bedrock when possible.
The survey crew will be equipped with shovel test forms, notebooks, camera,
compass, and a project area map for accurate plotting of shovel tests, backhoe trenches,
and archaeological sites. In addition to shovel testing as a means of identifying buried sites,
select areas in alluvial settings or areas with some appreciable soil depth will be subjected
to backhoe trenching. All sites identified in the project area will be mapped in the field and
plotted on a topographic map. Site locations will also be determined through the use of a
32

Global Positioning System (GPS). Each site will be recorded using the official State of
Texas Archeological Site Form. In no case will the survey crew work outside of the project
area as depicted on the project area map provided by the client.
Only diagnostic artifacts will be collected from the surface. All artifacts recovered
through shovel testing will be collected. These specimens will be bagged and recorded on
a field sack log. They will be analyzed and prepared for eventual curation at TARL, unless
a petition to discard is prepared and accepted.
The draft report will be submitted to AD-THC for review. Once the report has been
approved by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), copies will be delivered to
AD-THC and the client. A.A.G. will maintain copies of the notes, photographs, site forms,
and any other records produced from the project deemed to be a work product.
Scope of Work
I.

Conduct background check for previously recorded archaeological sites in the
project area and the vicinity. Review the relevant literature.

II.

Discuss the project with the AD-THC reviewer assigned to this project before
entering the field.

III.

Obtain an antiquities permit from AD-THC.

IV.

Consult with the representative of the sponsor before beginning the field survey.

V.

Perform a 100% pedestrian survey of the project area to include shovel testing, and
examination of all exposed areas such as creek banks for buried or displaced
artifacts.

VI.

Check for deeply buried sites through the use of backhoe trenching in areas with
deep soils.

VII.

Analyze all artifacts recovered and prepare them for curation at TARL.

VIII.

Prepare a draft report and submit copies to the AD-THC and the sponsor for review.

IX.

Make all required changes, correct any mistakes, and submit the final report and
turn in the artifacts for curation.

RE: Radiocarbon Dating Result For Sample 41LU74
Dear Mr. Bradle:
Enclosed is the radiocarbon dating result for one sample recently sent to us. As usual, specifics of
the analysis are listed on the report with the result and calibration data is provided where applicable. The
Conventional Radiocarbon Age has been corrected for total fractionation effects and where applicable,
calibration was performed using 2013 calibration databases (cited on the graph pages).
The web directory containing the table of results and PDF download also contains pictures, a cvs
spreadsheet download option and a quality assurance report containing expected vs. measured values for
3-5 working standards analyzed simultaneously with your samples.
The reported result is accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423
standards and all pretreatments and chemistry were performed here in our laboratories and counted in our
own accelerators here in Miami. Since Beta is not a teaching laboratory, only graduates trained to strict
protocols of the ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 program participated in the
analysis.
As always Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per
the conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce
sigmas lower than +/- 30 years, a conservative +/- 30 BP is cited for the result.
When interpreting the result, please consider any communications you may have had with us
regarding the sample. As always, your inquiries are most welcome. If you have any questions or would
like further details of the analysis, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Thank you for prepaying the analyses. As always, if you have any questions or would like to
discuss the results, donât hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,
