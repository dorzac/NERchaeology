ABSTRACT
The City of Clyde is proposing to construct a portion of the Fort Phantom Hill
water supply pipeline in Jones and Callahan counties, Texas. The City of Clyde
contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. to perform a cultural resource survey of a
one-mile-long high potential area identified by ARC in March 2016. Molly Hall,
surveyed two 30-meter-wide transects along the entire mile route on April 25,
2016. The only archaeological site observed was recorded as 41JS134. This site is
a historic diversion ditch constructed in 1954 to divert water from Deadman
Creek to Lake Fort Phantom Hill. The portion of the ditch within the current
project’s right-of-way consists of the ditch and no other features. However, the
ditch extends several hundred meters to the east and west. Additionally, there is a
dam and other features associated with the ditch visible on aerial photographs to
the east.
Without fully exploring the complete ditch and the associated features, an
eligibility determination cannot be made. However, the ditch will be avoided by
boring under it during construction of this pipeline and, therefore, no historic
properties will be affected by this project.
Based upon the results of this archaeological survey, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that further cultural resource investigations along this pipeline route
are unwarranted. Furthermore, we recommend that if buried cultural materials are
discovered during construction, work should immediately stop in that area and the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
The cities of Clyde and Ballinger are proposing to construct 87 miles of water lines in Jones,
Taylor, Callahan, and Runnels counties, Texas. The costs of this project are being split between
the two cities. The City of Clyde is responsible for 22.4 miles of the route from Lake Fort
Phantom Hill to Clyde.
The City of Clyde contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct a cultural resource
evaluation to determine the prehistoric and historic archaeological presence in the project area. In
March 2016, ARC recommended one mile of the route that is near Deadman Creek in southeast
Jones County be surveyed with limited shovel testing (Figure 1). The rest of the route was not
recommended for survey due to its location either in uplands far from Deadman Creek or
because it would be placed in existing road rights-of-way within the city of Clyde. The THC
agreed with this survey strategy.
A cultural resource investigation was required because the City of Clyde is a political entity of
the State of Texas, and Texas Antiquities Permit Number 7525 was issued for the archaeological
survey. Relevant legislation includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource
Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). The Archeology Division of the THC will review this report as the
State Agency responsible for administering the Texas Antiquities Code. The cultural resource
survey was conducted April 25, 2016. A total of one mile of the route was surveyed in two 30meter-wide transects. A total of 24 acres was surveyed.
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of
the THC (Council of Texas Archeologists n.d.). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and
previous investigations within the study area. A chapter on the research design and methodology
employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report
concludes with recommendations followed by the references cited and an appendix.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is situated within the Central Great Plains Ecoregion of Texas (Griffith et al.
2004). Soils in this region are deep, except on ridges and breaks. This region features an eroded
surface of hills and undulating plains developed on upper Paleozoic formations (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1996). The proposed project area is situated on the upland divide between
Deadman Creek and Elm Creek and crosses a man-made ditch that connects those two
waterways.
The geology of the project area is anchored by Permian-age sediments attributed to the Clear
Fork Group as well as undivided Quaternary deposits along the Deadman Creek drainage
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1972). An estimated one thousand feet of Permian sediments are
present in the northern third of the pipeline route.
The northern 60 meters of the route are mapped as Weymouth clay loam with 3-5 percent slopes
(Rogers et al. 1972). The Weymouth series has 0-6 inches of reddish-brown clay loam above the
dark reddish brown B horizon. The next 475 meters are mapped as the Tarrant complex. Tarrant
soils formed over limestone and have 8 to 15 inches of dark grayish brown clay overlying
limestone bedrock. The next 310 meters are on Olton clay loam with 0-1 percent slopes, which is
described as 8-12 inches of reddish-brown clay loam above the reddish brown sandy clay B
horizon. The southern 775 meters are mapped on Rowena clay loam with 0-1 percent slopes. The
profile of the Rowena clay loam includes a surface layer of dark grayish-brown clay loam to a
depth of 10 inches underlain by very dark grayish-brown clay.

CULTURAL HISTORY
A well-defined cultural chronology for Jones County has not been developed, as relatively few
archaeological investigations have been conducted in this area of the southern Rolling Plains. As
the study area is situated on the northwestern portion of the Central Texas archaeological region,
as defined by Perttula (2004:9), a brief chronology of the Central Texas region is included here.
The cultural history of this region is generally divided into four major periods: Paleoindian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic (Collins 2004).
Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period is characterized as having small, nomadic bands of hunter-gathers whose
primary emphasis was the exploitation of now-extinct megafauna, such as mammoth and bison,
but it is believed that smaller game and plant gathering supplemented the Paleoindian diet
(Meltzer and Bever 1995:59). According to Bousman (2004) the period has been subdivided into
the Early Paleoindian and the Late Paleoindian. The two subdivisions are most easily identified
by differences in projectile points. Early Paleoindian (ca. 9200-8000 B.C.) is defined by the
presence of Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Late Paleoindian period (8000-6000 B.C.)
projectile points include the Angostura, Golondrina, and Scottsbuff. Sites dating to the
Paleoindian period typically consist only of surficial deposits or isolated projectile points (Lintz
et al. 1993:51); intact cultural deposits dating to the late Pleistocene/early Holocene are fairly
rare on the landscape (Holliday 1997:159). However, buried Paleoindian sites have been found,
and examples include the McLean site near Abilene (Bryan and Ray 1938:267), and the AdairSteadman site on the Clear Fork of the Brazos (Tunnell 1975). Only one Clovis point has been
reported in Jones County (Bever and Meltzer 2007).
Archaic Period
This period, which is the longest in Texas prehistory, lasting approximately 7,500 years, is
divided into four stages: Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, and Transitional Archaic.
In the Early Archaic (ca. 6000-2500 B.C.), population density was relatively low. Despite the
continued use of Paleoindian lithic technology, the emergence of a broadly-based hunting and
gathering adaptation, especially an increase in evidence of gathering, marks the advent of the
Archaic (Lintz et al. 1993:52). The appearance of grinding stones in period assemblages suggests
that the exploitation and processing of plant resources began to play a part, and the appearance of
stone-lined hearths suggests a general refinement in food processing. The appearance of burnedrock middens marks the end of this cultural milieu. Burned rock middens are the dominate
feature of sites from the Middle Archaic (ca. 2500-1000 B.C.) and suggest the increasing
importance of food processing and possibly specialized food harvesting. Yucca and sotol, which
would have been continually available in the cyclically xeric climatic conditions of the period,
are present at several Middle Archaic sites (Johnson and Goode 1994:26). The Late Archaic (ca.
1000-300 B.C.) is distinguished by broad-body, expanding stem dart points such as Castroville,
Marcos, and Montell. The period is marked by a general increase in populations, as evidenced by
the density of Late Archaic deposits at stratified sites found in the region, which are
disproportionately well-represented compared to earlier or succeeding periods (Prewitt
1985:217). The Transitional Archaic (ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 700) is defined by distinctive projectile

point types such as Ensor, Frio, Fairland, and Darl, which are smaller in size than those found in
the preceding period.
Late Prehistoric Period
The introduction and spread of the bow and arrow mark the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
Period. Two phases, the Austin and the Toyah, are recognized for this period. The Austin Phase
(ca. A.D. 700-1300) is characterized by the presence of Scallorn and Edwards arrow points. The
advent of the bow and arrow may be associated with violence, as many arrow points are found in
context with burials thought to be the result of arrow wound fatalities (Prewitt 1974, 1981:83).
The Toyah Phase (ca. A.D. 1300-1600) is associated with the resurgence of hunting as the
dominant subsistence strategy, which constitutes the first significant shift in area subsistence
patterns since the advent of the Archaic. Artifact assemblages reflect this, and include Perdiz
arrow points, large and thin bifaces, end scrapers, prismatic blades, and pottery (Collins
2004:123). The presence of exotic or non-local ceramics and arrow points at area sites dating to
the Late Prehistoric suggests an increase in long distance trading, particularly with the Caddo to
the east (McWilliams et al. 2000:4).
Historic Period
Spanish Explorers were the first Europeans to enter the region in the 16th century. The next
settlers of European descent arrived in the area in the mid-19th century, and Comanche, Kiowa,
Tonkawa, Caddos, Delawares, and Wichitas occupied or frequented the region during that time
(Odintz 2016). The first Euro-Americans settlement in Jones County was at Fort Phantom Hill in
1851. In addition to guarding the frontier, the fort served as protection to the Forty-niners
crossing Texas. The fort was abandoned three years after it was established and in 1958 became
a station on the Butterfield Overland Mail route.
Jones County was established in 1858 and due primarily to Native American raids during the
Civil War, growth in the county was slow. In 1881, Jones City (now Anson) became the county
seat. The county population dramatically increased in the 1880s and surpassed 7,000 by 1900.
Several railroads were constructed across the county in the early 1900s. This spurred the growth
of farming and ranching (predominantly cotton and cattle). However, extended drought at the
end of the 1910s and during the Dust Bowl greatly curtailed cotton production as the leading
economic pursuit in the county. Oil production took its place in the 1940s, and has remained an
important part of the county’s economy through the 1960s. Today agriculture, manufacturing,
food processing, and the petroleum industry make up the county’s relatively diverse economy
(Odintz 2016).
Lake Fort Phantom Hill was formed in 1938 by damming Elm Creek just west of the current
study area (Ricci 2016). By 1954, the population of Abilene, which is supported by the lake, had
grown and the city excavated a diversion ditch in 1954 to carry supplemental water from
Deadman Creek to the lake (Brazos River Authority 2016)

Previous Investigations
The archaeology of Jones County is closely tied to the activities of Dr. Cyrus N. Ray (1929,
1931, 1933, 1935, 1937, 1945) who was a founder of the Texas Archeological Society (formerly
the Texas Archaeological and Paleontological Society). Ray collaborated with E. B. Sayles
(1929, 1935) of Gila Pueblo in Globe, Arizona (Ray and Sayles 1941) in the definition of a
cultural and chronological framework for prehistoric Native American sites in the Abilene area.
Ray’s work has not been expanded upon, largely due to the fact that very few prehistoric site
investigations have been conducted in the immediate area since World War II.
Ray and Sayles recorded a number of sites near Abilene along Buck, Cedar, and Elm creeks,
both upstream and downstream from the study area. According to TASA, the nearest such site to
the current survey area is 41JS58, which Sayles recorded in 1928 and which lies 200 meters east
of the pipeline route at the diversion ditch (2016). Unfortunately, no more information is
available about the site.
In 1996, ARC surveyed the area where a floodwater channel of Elm Creek would be constructed
approximately four miles southwest of the current project area (Skinner 1996). During this
survey, two archaeological sites (41TA136 and 41TA137) originally recorded by Sayles were
revisited. 41TA136 consists of two bedrock mortars and a small scatter of flakes and fire-cracked
rock. 41TA137 consisted of twelve artifacts, mostly lithic debris. Neither of these sites was
determined to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
In 2003, ARC surveyed 40 miles of a water pipeline route which begins at the Abilene Water
Treatment Plant and runs west before turning northwest and terminating in Hamlin, Texas
(Skinner et al. 2003). No sites were recorded in the southern end of the survey.
Significantly more work has been done southwest of Abilene and several sites have been
recorded in this portion of the Elm Creek Watershed. Southwest of and approximately 20 miles
upstream from the study area at a bend on Elm Creek, Ray recorded the Gibson Site (41TA1) in
1930, and both he and Sayles studied it over the next few years (TASA 2016). The site is
potentially Paleoindian, with Sayles and Ray reporting fluted lanceolate points, and the remains
of extinct fauna deeply buried in the floodplain. The site has been revisited several times (Acuna
et al. 2003; Cliff et al. 1991; Jones et al. 2004), but no Paleoindian artifacts, features, or
components have ever been located. Only surficial finds of lithic debitage have been noted in the
more recent investigations.
In 2014, American Archaeology Group, LLC surveyed eight kilometers of proposed pipeline
route from Lake Fort Phantom Hill coming within 500 meters of the current project area (Uecker
2015). Three prehistoric sites were recorded, one of which (41JS124) is 630 meters west of the
southern end of the current study area (TASA 2016). Site 41JS124 measures 600m north/south
by 30m east/west and consist of a deflated scatter of cores and flakes with one biface. This site is
located on the divide between Elma and Deadman creeks and was determined ineligible within
the project right of way.
Several historic maps were examined prior to fieldwork including the 1936 and 1955 General
Highway maps (GHMs) of Jones County and the 1957, 1967, 1974, and 1987 Hamby, TX 7.5’

USGS topographic maps. Other topographic maps dating back to 1891 were also examined, but
no features are structures are shown within the survey area. No structures are shown in the
project area on the GHMs or the 1957 and 1967 Hamby topographic maps. However, three
structures are mapped near the northern end of the survey area on the 1974 and 1987 topographic
maps. The eastern-most structure is near the centerline of the pipeline route and the other two
structures are outside the survey area to the east. Additionally, the Lake Fort Phantom Hill
Deadman Creek diversion ditch appears on all the 7.5’ topographic maps and on aerial
photographs from 1967 to the present.

RESEARCH DESIGN
Research Design
Based on the research conducted prior to survey, two hypotheses were developed. First, it was
hypothesized that prehistoric archaeological sites could be encountered in the project area,
especially along the southern portion where there is similar geology and topography to that of
site 41JS124. It is not expected that camp sites or significant buried deposits would be found
along the route. This was based on the location of the tract in the uplands between Elm Creek
(2.6 km to the west) and Deadman Creek (300m to the east). Permanent water was not easily
accessible in this location prehistorically, and the upland terrain would not provide protection
against inclement weather. Lastly, the plant and animal populations that inhabit this area would
have provided low diversity of food resources.
The second hypothesis states that there was potential for encountering historic sites in two
locations: at the diversion ditch (the ditch itself possibly being a site), and the cluster of
structures that appears on the 1974 topographic map. The construction date of these structures is
unclear, but falls between 42 and 49 years ago.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (n.d.). The author
walked the route in two 30-meter-wide transects. Due to the high percentage of ground visibility,
only one shovel test was excavated (in an area with less than 30-percent ground visibility). The
author made notes about the ground exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas where subsoil was
exposed. Photographs were taken during the survey using a 16-megapixel, GPS-equipped, digital
camera. Isolated artifact and shovel test locations as well as the project and site boundaries were
marked with a handheld Garmin GPSmap78 receiver.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections. The first describes the project area’s natural setting
along with results of the pedestrian survey and the description of the historic diversion ditch
recorded as site 41JS134. Conclusions derived from the survey close the chapter.
Survey Results
Based on aerial photographs, the northern 480m of the survey route was cleared and possibly
plowed in the 1960s or 1970s. The vegetation consists of prairie grasses and mesquite providing
50-percent ground visibility. Chert and limestone cobbles are abundant and many show wear
from decades of modern agriculture. An undecorated, white ware, rim sherd was found on the
surface in this pasture near where the structures had been mapped (Figure 2). No other artifacts
were visible on the surface and farming outbuildings were visible to the east outside the survey
area. Shovel test (ST1) was dug near the sherd, but no artifacts were found subsurface (Figure 4).
This ST had 20cm of dark brown (7.5YR3/3) clay loam above dark grayish brown (10YR4/2)
loamy clay. Two unworked, fist-sized, chert cobbles were found in the top 20cm. Also, modern
agricultural objects were found in the vicinity of the mapped structures, but no foundation or
other structural features were noted (Figure 3). Various disturbances, including a stock pond and
evidence of chaining or plowing, were noted along this portion of the route. The next 140m of
the route were through a field planted with wheat yielding 50-percent ground visibility.

Modern equipment found near the mapped structure location, facing southeast.

The route then crosses a large, historic diversion ditch that was recorded as site 41JS134 and is
detailed below. The property south of the ditch had been part of a cultivated field prior to the
ditch construction. Once the ditch cut through the field, the small, southern portion of the
property was abandoned. Currently, this wedge of land had abundant mesquite trees, cacti, and
grass growing on it with 30-40 percent ground visibility. The route then passes through a
recently plowed field with 100-percent ground visibility (Figure 5). This field had abundant peasized chert pebbles with a few larger cobbles, but no artifacts were found in the survey corridor.
The last 550 meters crosses a field with 50-percent ground visibility and prairie grasses.
Site 41JS134
This site consists of a ditch that was constructed in 1954 to divert water from Deadman Creek to
Lake Fort Phantom Hill via an unnamed tributary of Elm Creek. Where crossed by the current
study area's route, the ditch is approximately 45m across at the top and 15m across at the bottom
(Figure 6 and Figure 7). It is roughly 12m deep, at least 5m of which are through the bedrock.
Only a section 60m wide (the project survey corridor) was observed during this recording.
However, the ditch is clearly visible on aerial photographs and the topographic maps extending
at least 400m west and at least 300m east (Figure 4). Outside the survey area to the east and
observable on aerial photographs are related features including a dam on Deadman Creek. That
portion of the ditch and the additional features were not directly observed during this survey and
should be recorded in the future, if they will be impacted. No berms were noted in association
with the ditch, so the placement/disposal of the ditch fill is unknown.

Conclusions
No prehistoric archaeological sites, features, or artifacts were identified during the survey of the
pipeline route. It was anticipated that sites like the 41JS124 lithic scatter may have been located
during the survey. Ground visibility was generally good enough to see the abundant chert
cobbles, but none had been modified prehistorically. No historic structures or remnants thereof
were found at the location indicated as a structure on the 1974 and 1987 topographic maps.
Because the structure was marked as part of the 1974 photorevision, which was made from aerial
photographs and was not always ground-truthed, it is possible that what was visible on the aerial
was large farm equipment, like that observed at the time of this survey, or a small, temporary
farm structure. It is also possible that since 1974, the structure that was there has been
completely removed.
Lastly, the diversion ditch that bisects the survey transect was recorded as site 41JS134. The
ditch was constructed in 1954. This feature consists solely of the cut channel, which runs
approximately 800 meters between Deadman Creek and an unnamed tributary of Elm Creek that
leads to Lake Fort Phantom Hill. Other features associated with the ditch are visible on aerial
photographs 400 meters east of the current study area, but no features associated with the ditch
were observed within the project ROW. The lack of historic trash is attributed wo the lack of
historic roads along the route and by historic use of the land as farmland

RECOMMENDATIONS
The intensive archaeological survey of the one-mile-long high potential area resulted in the
recording a segment of a historic diversion ditch, site 41JS134. This site was only recorded
within the 200-ft-wide ROW associated with this project. In reality, the site extends several
hundred meters to the east and to the west, but these portions were not observed during the
survey. At this time, not enough of the site has been observed and recorded to make an eligibility
determination as to the sites eligibility for listing on the NRHP or designation as a State
Antiquities Landmark. The construction of this ditch is not “associated with events that have
made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history,” nor is it “associated with the
lives of significant persons in our past.” Additionally, the site is not likely to yield information
important in our history. Therefore, the site is not recommended eligible for listing on the NRHP
under criteria A, B, or D.
The entire ditch could potentially be eligible under criterion C, since it appears to “embody the
distinctive characteristics of a type [and] method of construction,” or could be a contributing
element of a larger network including the dam and other features to the east. Without directly
observing and recording the entire ditch and those other features, it is not possible to make a
recommendation on the entire site since they may be able to shed light on diversion ditch
construction and use in the mid-1900s.
The pipeline will be bored beneath the ditch and the ditch will not be affected by this project.
Therefore, there will be no historic properties affected by this undertaking. No further
archaeological work is recommended along the pipeline route. If cultural resources are
discovered during construction activities associated with the installation of the pipeline, work in
the immediate area should cease and the THC should be contacted. Additionally, if other parts of
the site or the associated structures (dam, etc.) to the east will be impacted by any other project,
they should first be recorded and evaluated for their significance as cultural resources.
