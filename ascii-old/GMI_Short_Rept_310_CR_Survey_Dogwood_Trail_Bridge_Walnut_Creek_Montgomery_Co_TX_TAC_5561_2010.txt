ABSTRACT
In March 2010, Geo-Marine, Inc., under contract to HNTB Corporation, conducted an intensive
archeological survey of a 0.41-acre parcel for a proposed bridge replacement at Dogwood Trail
and Walnut Creek in southwestern Montgomery County. The area of potential effects (APE) is
91.4 meters (300 feet) long and 18.3 meters (60 feet) wide and is confined to the existing
roadway right-of-way. Vertical impacts within the APE will be restricted to the upper 0.9 meters
(3 feet) except at the stream crossing, where depth of construction could extend to a depth of 2.4
meters (8 feet). The judgmental subsurface investigations employed within the APE included the
excavation of five shovel tests, two Gradall trenches, and one 50-x-50-centimeter (20-x-20-inch)
test unit. Each excavation contained evidence of an active alluvial environment within the APE,
and two yielded disturbed deposits associated with the construction of maintenance of Dogwood
Trail and the existing bridge structure. A combination of oyster shells and gravels used as fill to
support the bridge structure was observed within a trench profile and test unit profile, and sandy
fill has been placed near the stream bank in the northwest quadrant. No cultural materials were
recovered in any of the subsurface excavation units. Overall, the archeological integrity of the
APE is low.
All data generated from this project will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeology
Research Laboratory in Austin at the conclusion of the project.

INTRODUCTION
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing to replace the existing singlespan, steel stringer bridge on concrete and steel substructure at Dogwood Trail and Walnut Creek,
Montgomery County, with a 22.9-meter (m; 75-foot [ft]), prestressed concrete slab, beam bridge
with two bents placed in the channel of Walnut Creek (Figures 1 and 2). The proposed survey
segment is approximately 91.4 m (m; 300 ft) long with a current right-of-way (ROW) width of
approximately 18.3 m (60 ft). According to the engineering schematics available (Figure 3), most
of the construction activities would occur within the top 0.9 m (3 ft) except at the stream banks
where drilled support shafts could extend to a depth of 2.4 m (8 ft). The total 0.41 acres of
current ROW and construction easement comprises the area of potential effects (APE) for the
project and includes a depth of 2.4 m (8 ft) at the creek. The project area occurs entirely within
state-owned property.
TxDOT is required under the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12) to provide an
environmental and cultural assessment of the area to be affected by the proposed construction
activities associated with the bridge replacement. HNTB Corporation (HNTB) was contracted to
provide the environmental consulting services for the project. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI; project #
30007.13.01.01), of Plano, Texas, was then subcontracted by HNTB to provide the cultural
resources investigation portion of the project. Fieldwork was conducted on March 17 and 31,
2010, by Ben Fullerton and Lindsey Skelton of GMI. Melissa Green, also of GMI, served as
Principal Investigator.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this APE was to conduct an inventory or
determine the presence/absence of archeological resources (36 CFR 800.4) and to evaluate
identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), as per Section 106 (36 CRF 800) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended, or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL) under the Antiquities
Code of Texas (13 TAC 26.12). This project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
5561.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
This project area falls in a rural setting within the narrow valley of Walnut Creek. The
underlying geology for the project consists of the Quaternary (Pleistocene) Fluviatile terrace
deposits undivided (Bureau of Economic Geology 1992). Soils in the project area fall within the
Conroe association, which is composed of soils that are deep, gently sloping to rolling,
moderately and well-drained sandy soils that have clayey lower layers (McClintock et al. 1972).
The specific soil mapped within the project area is Bibb soils, frequently flooded, that are found
on floodplains of streams draining sandy and loamy soils and have less than 1 percent slopes.
They occur along stream channels and between the natural levees of the channels and uplands
(McClintock et al. 1972:9). The profile consists of 25 centimeters (cm; 10 inches [in]) of grayish
brown very fine sandy loam with distinct brown mottles, underlain by 25 cm (10 in) of grayish
brown very fine sandy loam with fine prominent reddish mottles, followed by 108 cm (43 in) of
gray very fine sandy loam with pockets of very pale brown and white silt loam (McClintock et al.
1972:8).

CULTURAL HISTORY
Six archeological time periods have been associated with Native American occupations in
southeast Texas. These include Paleoindian, Archaic, Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, Protohistoric,
and Historic Indian. Archeologists within the region agree on the general framework, but there is
some discrepancy regarding the temporal boundaries of these periods. Pattersonâs (1995)
chronology includes Early Paleoindian (10,000â8000 B.C.), Late Paleoindian (8000â5000 B.C.),
Early Archaic (5000â3000 B.C.), Middle Archaic (3000â1500 B.C.), Late Archaic (1500 B.C.âA.D.
100); Early Ceramic (A.D. 100â600), Late Prehistoric (A.D. 600â1500), Protohistoric (A.D. 1500â
1700), and Historic Indian (A.D. 1700â1800). In contrast, Ensor (1990) offers a chronology that
includes Paleoindian (10,000â8000 B.C.), Early Archaic (8000â5000 B.C.), Middle Archaic
(5000â1000 B.C), Late Archaic (1000 B.C.âA.D. 400), Early Ceramic (A.D. 400â800), and Late
Ceramic (A.D. 800â1750). Despite the differences, the chronologies developed by researches are
based primarily on changes in projectile point technologies and the introduction of pottery.

METHODS
Prior to beginning fieldwork, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was consulted to determine if
any previously recorded cultural properties or cultural resources management projects have
occurred within a 1-kilometer (km; 0.6-mile [mi]) radius of the project area. The review indicates
that there are no archeological sites recorded or any cultural resources surveys that have been
conducted within a kilometer of the project area. Based on the information available, the
potential for identifying buried prehistoric sites within the alluvium is good, and the potential for
historic sites is fair.
The Houston District Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) was also consulted to
determine the type of archeological investigation recommended for the project area. PALM is a
predictive model that utilizes geoarcheological knowledge to identify areas that have the potential
for containing preserved archeological sites (Abbott 2001). PALM was used in this archeological
investigation as a planning tool for the conditions that were likely to be encountered in the field.
According to PALM, the project area falls within areas underlain by deep Holocene deposits that
exhibit low to moderate surficial disturbances. As a result, PALM data recommended a surface
survey with shovel testing and deep reconnaissance if deep impacts were anticipated. Based on
the PALM map for this area, deep trenching is required.
The project area was first traversed to inspect the ground surface and exposed stream banks for
the presence of cultural materials. Following this, shovel tests were judgmentally excavated in
areas that appeared to be minimally disturbed from previous construction activities. The number
of shovel tests excavated within the project is consistent with the survey standards of three shovel
tests per acre in survey areas of 2 acres or less as recommended by the Council of Texas
Archeologists and approved by the Texas Historical Commission. Each shovel test was
approximately 35 cm (14 in) in diameter and excavated in approximately 20-cm (8-in) arbitrary
levels to 80 cm (32 in) below surface (bs), or until subsoil was encountered. The soils removed
from shovel tests were processed through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) mesh screen. The soils and any
artifacts observed in each shovel test were recorded on standardized forms. Digital photographs
were used to document the survey conditions, disturbances, and any cultural features observed.
Details of each photograph were recorded on standardized forms.

Two Gradall trenches were then excavated in the southeast and southwest quadrants near the
stream banks of Walnut Creek to search for deeply buried deposits. The discovery of a lens of
oyster shells within a trench wall in the southeast quadrant prompted the excavation of a 50-x-50cm (20-x-20-in) test unit to determine if the shell lens was archeological or associated with the
construction of the bridge structure. Trenching in the northern quadrants was avoided due to
overhead and buried utilities within the relatively narrow ROW.
All data generated from this project will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeology
Research Laboratory in Austin at the conclusion of the project.

RESULTS
The project area consists of Dogwood Trail, the existing concrete-slab beam bridge (Figure 4),
and a moderately dense hardwood forest in each quadrant of the APE (Figure 5). Sandy fill has
recently been placed in the northwest quadrant adjacent to the stream bank (Figure 6), erosion
prevention walls have been constructed at the bridge abutments in the southeast and southwest
quadrants (Figure 7), and overhead and buried utilities parallel the north side of Dogwood Trail
(see Figure 6). As noted by the recent sandy deposits on the ground surfaces in the southern
quadrants of the APE, the area is within an active alluvial environment subject to occasional
overbank flooding.

The survey began with an inspection of the ground surface and other exposed areas along the
creek banks for the presence of cultural materials or buried surfaces where intact cultural
materials could potentially be preserved; however, no archeological materials or buried surfaces
were noted during this process. Five shovel tests were excavated within the APE (Table 1).
Shovel Tests 1 and 2 were excavated near the stream banks in the southeast and southwest
quadrants, respectively. The profiles consisted of yellowish brown to brown sands and sandy
loams (see Table 1). Layers with appreciable clay content were observed alternating with layers
of sand in the upper 20 cm bs (8 in) of Shovel Test 1. These profiles are driven entirely by
alternating energies of deposition during overbank flooding. No cultural materials were
recovered.
Shovel Test 3 was excavated on a small natural levee approximately 20 m (66 ft) east of the
bridge in the southeast quadrant. The profile was relatively homogenous, consisting of a brown
sandy loam (10YR 4/3) between 0 and 55 cm bs (0â22 in) grading into a brown (10YR 4/3) sandy
clay loam between 55 and 80 cm bs (22â32 in) (see Table 1). This profile differs from the two
profiles described above due to its slightly elevated position above the level where recent
alluvium has been deposited.

Finally, Shovel Tests 4 and 5 were excavated approximately 25 m (82 ft) west and east of the
bridge in the northwest and northeast quadrants, respectively. Shovel tests were excavated near
Dogwood Trail due to the presence of buried utilities. Shovel Test 4 consisted of brown (10YR
4/3) sandy loam between 0 and 30 cm bs (0â12 in) and yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) sand
between 30 and 80 cm bs (12â32 in) (see Table 1).
Shovel Test 5 exhibited a disturbed profile (see Table 1) likely due to its position only 1.5 m (5 ft)
from the roadway. Mottling began at 5 cm bs (2 in) becoming less prominent with depth, and
road gravels and ironstone concretions were observed between 5 and 35 cm bs (2â14 in). No
cultural materials were recovered from any of the five shovel tests.

Two Gradall trenches were excavated within the southeast and southwest quadrants to search for
deeply buried deposits within the Holocene alluvium mapped in the APE. Trench 1 was
excavated in the southeast quadrant near the stream bank and Dogwood Trail. Again, alternating
beds of brown to yellowish brown (Table 2; Figure 8) sands, sandy loams, and sandy clay loams
were encountered. Between 75 and 95 cm bs (30â37 in), however, a layer of oyster shells was
observed in the west wall of the trench profile, and several flecks of charcoal were observed
below the oyster lens. A portion of the deposit was then scraped clean and a sample was troweled
through to determine if the oysters were archeological or the result of previous construction
activities. This process noted gravels intermixed with the oyster shells without associated
archeological materials, but the origin of the shell lens was still indeterminate. As result, a 50-x50-cm (20-x-20 in) test unit was excavated between the trench wall and the stream bank closer to
the southeast bridge abutment to obtain a larger sample to test (Figure 9). This resulted in the
discovery of a mixture of asphalt, gravels, ironstone, and oyster shells between 40 and 60 cm bs
(16â24 in); a modern wine cooler bottle (not collected) was observed at 30 cm bs in the wall of
the test unit. The deposits was clearly disturbed, and the fact that the shell lens began nearly
35 cm (14 in) closer to the surface than within the trench was taken as evidence that the mixture
is likely slumping distally from the southeast bridge abutment. Subsequent to this finding, the
southeast bridge abutment was inspected and shells were observed eroding out of a concrete and
asphalt mixture (Figure 10). It is clear that the shells are not archeological.

Lastly, Trench 2 was excavated in the southwest quadrant approximately 13 m (43 ft) from the
stream bank and 5 m (16 ft) south of the edge of Dogwood Trail. No shell was observed within
this profile (Figure 11), which again consisted of alternating layers of brown to yellowish brown
(see Table 2) sands and sandy loams between 0 and 205 cm bs (0â81 in). A deposit of charcoal
was observed within a root system protruding from the east wall of the trench profile. However,
the charcoal was clearly a result of natural burning. No artifacts were recovered from either
trench.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The archeological investigations undertaken within the project area did not recover any cultural
materials, and indicated that the majority of the project area has been disturbed by modern
construction activities. No historic properties as defined under 36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5(6), 13
TAC 26.5(32), and 13 TAC 26.8 were identified during the archeological investigation of the
current project APE. As a result of these investigations, there appears to be little potential for the
presence of significant archeological deposits within the project area. In accordance with 36 CFR
800.4(d)(2) and 13 TAC 26.2, no further investigation is necessary. Consequently, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed. If archeological deposits are encountered
during construction, work should cease and the Texas Historical Commission should be notified.
