ABSTRACT
Sphere 3 Environmental, Inc. (Sphere 3) conducted an intensive pedestrian cultural
resource survey of approximately 15.12 hectares (37.35 acres) of land designated as the
Area of Potential Effects (APE) on October 28, 29, and 31, and November 6, 2019, in
response to the proposed undertaking to construct the Hallsville ISD K - 4 School
campus. The project sponsor and owner of the project area is the Hallsville Independent
School District. The project area is situated wholly within the City of Longview, Texas.
The project area is located on the southwest side of Loop 281 and the north side of Page
Road in western Harrison County. The cultural resources survey was conducted under
Texas Antiquities Permit Number 9146 to identify properties eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or listing as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL). A total of 81 shovel tests were excavated across the project area. Two
archaeological sites, 41HS1024 and 41HS1025 were newly discovered by the survey.
Site 41HS1024 was identified as a dual-component historic and indeterminate prehistoric,
very low-density subsurface artifact distribution site. The site consists of five chipped
stone flakes and flake fragments and two historic glass shards. Site 41HS1025 was
identified as an early to middle 20th century historic, low-density subsurface and surface
artifact scatter. Cultural objects recovered from shovel testing of the two newly recorded
sites and all documents associated with this investigation were curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas. Site 41HS1024 and Site
41HS1025 have been evaluated as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for listing as
a SAL. Sphere 3 therefore recommends that construction of school campus buildings and
facilities proceed as planned without further cultural resource investigations.

INTRODUCTION
Hallsville Independent School District (ISD) plans to develop an approximately 15.12-hectare
(ha) (37.35 acre [ac]) tract of land, designated as the project area or Area of Potential Effect
(APE), for development of a new K - 4 School campus in Longview, Texas (Figures 1 and 2).
The maximum depth of proposed soil disturbance is 50 to 55 feet for placement of drilled
foundation piers and geotechnical borings. Sphere 3 Environmental, Inc. (Sphere 3) was retained
by Hallsville ISD to determine whether any cultural resources eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or eligible for designation as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL) will be adversely impacted by proposed construction activities.
This Phase I cultural resources investigation was developed for this project area, as owned by a
subdivision of the State of Texas, to assure that Hallsville ISD remains in compliance with the
provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas. Since no federal funds, permits, or lands are
involved, this construction undertaking is not subject to Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) 1966, as amended. One of these provisions calls for the permanent
curation of field documents, reports, and artifacts and other field specimens collected during the
field survey. The repository with which arrangements have been made for transferring these
materials is the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), University of Texas at
Austin, located in Austin, Texas.
To identify any historic and/or archaeological properties existing within the project area, Sphere 3
developed a scope of work proposing a Phase I intensive cultural resources survey. The Texas
Historical Commission (THC) accepted this proposed scope and issued Texas Antiquities Permit
Number (No.) 9146 on behalf of the Hallsville ISD as project sponsor and owner. Fieldwork was
conducted on October 28, 29, and 31 and November 6, 2019 under the direction James S. Belew,
RPA, who served as Principal Investigator (PI) and Michael Ryan.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area consists of an irregularly shaped 15.12 ha (37.35 ac) tract of gently to
moderately sloping uplands in Longview, Texas. The area is bounded in the south by residential
properties along Page Road, on the east and north by Loop 281, and to the west by a combination
of property boundaries of commercial and residential properties and the transmission line
corridor. The area is comprised of mixed hardwood and pine forest and scattered open grassy
areas including a transmission line corridor and a vacant grassy lot along Page Road between
existing houses on the south side of the project area. An unnamed tributary of Mason Creek
flows eastward through the project area and into an artificial pond before returning to a smaller
channel and continuing eastward toward Mason Creek. The project area as defined above is
considered the Area of Potential Effect (APE).
The project area lies within the Austroriparian biotic province, one of seven recognized by Blair
(1950) and Dice (1943) for the state of Texas based on ecological associations of a relatively
stable assemblage of plants and animals. This ecotone describes a region comprised of
hardwoods and pines extending eastward to the Atlantic, the dominant species being loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda). The primary vegetative species identified in the forested area are southern red oak
(Quercus falcata), water oak (Quercus nigra), bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum), Bermudagrass
(Cynodon dactylon), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), sweetgum (Liquidambar

virginiana). Vegetation in the open areas consists of Bermudagrass and bahiagrass.
The NRCS Web Soil Survey illustrates the project area is made up of the Bowie, Cuthbert, and
Kirvin soil series. The individual soil units that make up the project area include:




BoC – Bowie very fine sandy loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes
CbE – Cuthbert fine sandy loam, 5 to 15 percent slopes
KfC – Kirvin very fine sandy, 2 to 5 percent slopes

Bowie soils are very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy marine deposits found on
interfluves (USDA, 2019). Bowie soils consist of very fine sandy loam from 0 cm to 25.4 cm (0
in to 10 in), sandy clay loam from 25.4 cm to 58.4 cm (10 in to 23 in), clay loam from 58.4 cm to
78.7 cm (23 in to 31 in), and sandy clay loam from 78.7 cm to 210.8 cm (31 in to 83 in) (USDA
2016).
Cuthbert soils are moderately deep, well drained soils formed in clayey marine deposits (USDA,
2019). Cuthbert soils are found on moderately sloping to steep uplands, generally on long narrow
side slopes above drainageways (USDA 2004). These soils are composed of fine sandy loam
from 0 cm to 20.3 cm (0 in to 8 in), clay from 20.3 cm to 73.7 cm (8 in to 29 in), sandy clay loam
from 73.7 cm to 86.4 cm (29 in to 34 in), and sandstone with fine sandy loam and sandy clay
loam texture from 86.4 cm to 152.4 cm (34 in to 60 in) (USDA 2004).
Kirvin soils are deep, well drained soils found on interfluves (USDA 2011). These soils are
formed in stratified sandstone and shale derived from marine sediments (USDA 2011). Kirvin
soils are composed of very fine sandy loam from 0 cm to 27.9 cm (0 in to 11 in), clay from 27.9
cm to 119.4 cm (11 in to 47 in), and sandstone with sandy clay loam texture from 119.4 cm to
162.6 cm (47 in to 64 in) (USDA 2011).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Based on a site file search of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database and literature
search and records review, the proposed project area will not impact any previously recorded
archaeological sites or other recorded cultural resources. There are two archaeological sites
(41HS236 and 41HS237) and one previously conducted cultural resources survey within a onemile radius of the project area (Figure 3). There are no NRHP sites recorded within a one-mile
radius of the project.


Site 41HS236 – A prehistoric Caddo camp site containing three chert flakes, one mussel
shell, and one ceramic sherd on the exposed ground surface. The site is located
approximately 0.78 mile southwest of the project area on a sandy knoll between two
tributaries of Long Creek. The site was noted to possibly contain structural remains.
Further testing was recommended to determine the sites eligibility for inclusion on the
NRHP.



Site 41HS237 – Site contains a small scatter of four yellow chert flakes exposed by
erosion on a hillside and the foundation of an early 20th century structure on top of the
hill. The site is located approximately 0.56 mile southwest of the project area. No

official NRHP eligibility determination was available but no further work was
recommended at this site by the site recorder.
An intensive pedestrian survey was conducted by Sphere 3 Environmental, Inc. for the Longview
Independent School District (THC Permit 4988). The report was authored by Marc Tiemann and
James S Belew and entitled Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed Longview ISD Planned
Development of New Forest Park Middle School and Facilities on an Approximately 32-Acre
Tract of Land, Gregg County, Texas. The survey was conducted in 2008 and did not identify any
archaeological sites determined to be eligible for the NRHP or listing as a State Antiquities
Landmark.
A historic marker for the Temple Emanu-El Cemetery is mapped approximately 0.9 mile south of
the project area. The cemetery was established in 1957 along with a synagogue by Kilgore’s
Temple Beth Sholom. The cemetery was established as part of the larger Memory Park Cemetery
and became Harrison County’s second dedicated Jewish cemetery. Nationally renowned civil
rights leader Rabbi Charles Mantinband is buried in the cemetery.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Paleoindian Period (ca. 16,000 years ago to ca. 8,000 years ago)
The term “Paleoindian” refers to populations known to inhabit the Americas from the terminal
Pleistocene into the early Holocene. Most scholars since the 1950s have employed this term to
describe and discuss all cultural developments for the first humans in the Pleistocene New World
(Willey and Phillips 1958:80) “whose subsistence base included the exploitation of extinct
megafauna such as mammoth, bison (Bison antiquus), camel, and horse” (Bousman et al.
2004:16, citing Fiedel 1994). The Paleoindian stage is represented by peoples known to have
shared identified cultural attributes and food procurement activities that extend far beyond the
physiographic regions typically defining the geographic limits of later prehistoric cultures.
Peoples inhabiting northeast Texas at this time exhibit remarkable similarities in cultural traits
with other groups of this period that appear throughout North and South America.
Most North American prehistorians traditionally have postulated that the earliest human
populations entered North America by crossing through mostly ice-free Beringia, the now
submerged land bridge separating Siberia from Alaska, and continued through ice-free passages
into the heart of North America. The Wisconsin glacial episode had exerted maximum coverage
of North America, during which sea levels dropped up to 350 feet below present levels (Meltzer
1989), until ca. 14,000 Before Present (B.P.) (ca. 12,000 B.C., involving uncalibrated
radiocarbon dating as routinely published from the early 1950s through the early 2010s), after
which seas began rising (Sabo and Early 1988:38). Beringia emerged as a broad isthmus over
which herds of mammoths and other large megafauna were followed by human populations into
the interior of North America (Marcom 2003:16-26). Cooper et al. (1998:76) theorizes: “PaleoIndians probably moved into North America from Asia sometime between 20,000 and 12,000
years ago.” Marcom (2003:16-26) adds, “As they progressed southward, human populations
inhabited new lands and adapted to ever new and diverse environments.”
Paleoindian populations traditionally have been characterized as consisting of highly mobile
bands of large-game hunters exhibiting largely the same tool types and site distribution patterns.
For the Pleistocene cultural occupations in present-day Southwestern United States, “…the
environment was cooler and wetter than it is today, and large, now extinct, mammals such as

6

mammoths, mastodons, and large bison roamed throughout [the south-central United States].”
Numerous sites situated throughout the American Southwest dating to this time frame were found
to contain lanceolate points associated with extinct megafauna (Brooks et al. 1985:15). The
large, symmetrical, aerodynamic lanceolate point was affixed to a wooden spear that was thrust
forth by the atlatl.
This formidable weapon system represents the centerpiece of a hypothesis calling for a
subsistence strategy based primarily on the hunting of large mammals (Wilmsen 1970).
Paleoindian populations for decades were believed to have followed large migrations of
mammoth, mastodon (Hudson 1976), and Bison antiquus (Wilmsen 1970; Smith et al. 1983:132).
The absence of groundstone tools and “burnt rock debris” [i.e. fire-cracked rock, or FCR] further
indicates an “emphasis on the hunting and processing of game animals” (Ferring 1994:56).
Scholars traditionally have interpreted from widely distributed Paleoindian assemblages a
subsistence strategy based primarily on the hunting of large mammals (Neuman 1984).
Throughout the Western Hemisphere a variety of cultural complexes dating several thousand
years prior to the Clovis horizon have been discovered and confirmed. This Pre-Clovis period
(ca. 16,000 to ca. 13,300 years ago, as evaluated under the recently adapted calibration of
absolute radiocarbon dating), predates by several millennia the emergence of the Clovis horizon
(before 12,400 to 11,900 years ago, calibrated dating). Until the middle 2010s, reconstruction of
any indigenous North American cultural phase prior to the Clovis era represented a controversial
issue. For the mid-20th century into the first decade of the 21st century, certain cultural resources
dated older than the Clovis horizon were reported in widespread locations in North and South
America. However, in such instances, some researchers had expressed concerns as to the veracity
of the findings. Since 2010, a select few pre-Clovis investigations have been conducted by
scholars with impeccable reputations in accordance with meticulous professional archaeological
standards. These investigations of impeccable quality, reported and published under rigorous
vetting and critical review, by 2019 have provided a preponderance of evidence that gradually
have persuaded most New World prehistorians that humans first entered the Americas
considerably earlier than the onset of the warming trend having caused rapid retreat of North
America’s continental glaciers, resulting in inland ice corridors (Sabo and Early 1988:38).
Perttula (2004:10) points out that recent discoveries at Monte Verde, Chile (Dillehay 1997,
Dillehay and Collins 1988, Dillehay 1989:1436, Petit 1998, Collins 1999) indicate occupations
earlier than 10,000 B.C. (uncalibrated). Monte Verde represents the first widely-accepted claim
for pre-Clovis occupation in the Western Hemisphere. The Topper Site in South Carolina,
represents an intact component dating to before 11,000 B.C. (uncalibrated) (Goodyear 1998,
2000, 2001). The micro-lithic types are significantly different from those of Clovis and Folsom
for each of these sites.
In proximity to Northeast Texas, reputable claims of cultural activity dated prior to the Clovis
period have been offered for the expansive archeological locality straddling the Balcones Fault,
dividing the Gulf Coastal Plains and the Edwards Plateau consisting of the Gault (Bell and
Williamson Counties), and Friedkin (Bell County) sites. The expansive Gault-Friedken locality is
a contiguous multi-component cultural manifestation covering several acres on both sides of the
line separating Williamson and Bell Counties. For more than 16,000 years these sites have been
provided unlimited permanent fresh water from with massive springs supplying Buttermilk
Creek. Michael B. Collins (2002) reported the existence of assemblages lying beneath Clovis
contexts at the Gault site (41BL323). Subsequent Gault research teams have documented fish-tail
projectile points and prismatic blades as chronologically diagnostic types identifying the Gault
Complex, dated by Oscillating Luminescence (OSL) dating technique to approximately 16,000

7

years ago, with an error of about 300 years, more than 2,500 years older than the Clovis period
(Williams et al. 2018: 3).
In 2011, Michael R. Waters et al. (2011) published evidence for interpreting similar components
underlying Clovis occupation zones at the Friedkin (Buttermilk Creek) site as being of a culture
significantly older than, and different from, the Clovis techno-complex. This Pre-Clovis massive
collection of 15,000 blades, flakes, and chips, many of which were bifacially retouched, includes
56 tools (Wilford 2011). Collectively identified as the “Buttermilk Creek Complex,” this
diagnostic assemblage (Waters et al. 2011) exhibits Old-World Upper Paleolithic-style blade
scrapers and knives. The few projectile points are of forms that widely differ from the lanceolate
Clovis, Folsom, and later Paleoindian types (Brown 2011). These Pre-Clovis tools exhibit no
highly recognizable style drawing immediate attention, in the manner exerted by the distinctively
fluted, symmetrically lanceolate Clovis point (Waters et al. 2011). The age of this component at
Friedkin site was evaluated by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of 49 soil cores
associated with Pre-Clovis tools, yielding dates of between 14,220 and 12,400 BC, for which the
“uncalibrated dates” range between 11,250 and 13,550 BC. This range falls almost 2,000 years
prior to the earliest Clovis dates, long before any corridors had opened permitting migration from
Beringia into the heart of North America. Waters (et al. 2011) said this strengthens the argument
that the earliest migrants hugged the shore and used small boats to travel from northeast Asia into
the Pacific coast of North America (Wilford 2011). The Gault-Freidkin locality of Central Texas
has emerged as being among the most compelling cases for the existence of a cultural complex
older than Clovis for the entirety of North America.
The Clovis cultural technocomplex (9200 – 8900 B.C., as supported by traditional uncalibrated
radiocarbon dating, represents a mobile hunter-gatherer society, traditionally interpreted as
having been organized socially into bands, primarily for conducting broad-range, high-mobility
hunting and gathering (Collins 2004:116, citing Haynes 1992). Hester (2004:133) insists that the
Clovis began in Texas ca.11,550 B.P. (9600 B.C., as derived from traditional older-style
uncalibrated radiocarbon age evaluation, or ca. 13,300 years ago in accordance with recently
adapted “calibrated radiocarbon” dating).
Sabo and Early (1988), along with the majority of North American prehistorians, have postulated
that the initial wave of humanity migrated overland from Siberia through Beringia into the
Americas, and that the vast majority, if not all, of these people were of the cultural system that
directly gave rise to the Clovis cultural complex. For decades, prehistorians had been puzzled by
not having found a technological complex ancestral to Clovis in northeastern Asia (Wilford
2011). In explaining this absence of an Asian “mother culture,” Waters (et al. 2011) suggests that
Clovis technology was wholly invented in the New World rather than in Asia.
These knappers, employing great skill and utilizing high-quality chert, applied the characteristic
scar distinguishing the Clovis point type by removing “flutes” from the basal end of the dorsal
face (McNutt 1996:188). The Clovis point type “…has a lanceolate outline with a short, wide
flute on one side and a narrower flute on the reverse side. The basal edges are heavily ground,
and after fluting, the base has been further thinned (Turner and Hester 1985 [1999]: 91).
However, in the wake of older projectile point types associated with the Gault and Buttermilk
Creek complexes, the Clovis point type no longer “…is the earliest diagnostic point form known
in North America” (Turner and Hester 1985 [1999]: 91).
Clovis points and other Clovis diagnostic artifacts were found associated in an intact manner with
the remains of North America’s largest extinct Pleistocene mammals, including mammoth,
mastodon, and the New World horse at several sites excavated and reported during the early to

8

middle twentieth century. Clovis hunting has been characterized as having an emphasis on the
exploitation of megafauna, as they adapted to environmental conditions of Terminal Pleistocene
south-central United States (Neuman 1984; Black 1989:49). A consensus of scholars agree that
the Clovis cultural complex in Texas and adjoining regions flourished in “an equitable, humid,
maritime paleo-climate…with a lower mean annual temperature than today; [with] cooler
summers and warmer winters that lacked extended freezing conditions….” (Johnson and Holliday
1995:522-523).
Since the 1970s, a growing number of scholars have challenged the theory that Clovis peoples were
dependent upon megafauna. They assert that Clovis were organized into small, mobile bands of
hunters and gatherers primarily to exploit a variety of plants and smaller animals (Story 1990; Smith
1983:9-10). Evidence for the adaptation of Clovis people to a subsistence economy more varied
than dependence on megafauna is found at the Shawn-Minisink site in Pennsylvania (McNutt et
al. 1977). Story and Smith cited corroborating findings by earlier scholars (Johnson 1977:65-77;
Haag 1971:6). Collins (1990; et al. 1989) in supporting the idea that Clovis subsistence always had
been derived from a variety of animal and plant foods and that plants provided significant
proportions of the Clovis diet. They detail the diverse micro-faunal species contributing to Clovis
subsistence, including water turtles, land tortoises, alligator, mice, badger, and raccoon, with new
world horse being as common as mammoth and mastodon, regarding larger animals exploited
(Collins 1995:381). Collins (2002) takes an additional theoretical step by proposing that Clovis is
best viewed as a “techno-complex – a constellation of technologies shared by multiple ethnically
distinct peoples over a wide area. What to archeologists 12 millennia later looks like a
widespread expression of a single culture may, in fact, have been a relatively superficial set of
shared material traits employed by groups who spoke different languages and lived by different
codes.”
The closest major Clovis component to this project area is the Aubrey site, north of Denton and
just south of the Red River, from which was recovered evidence of the hunting of extinct bison,
sloth, and possibly mammoth (Ferring 1992). The next closest – and largest Clovis component in
the Western Hemisphere – is the Gault site (Hester 2004:133), at which recent excavations have
revealed multiple habitation camp areas over a large occupation area, producing a cumulative
total of several hundred thousand chipped stone artifacts. This assemblage contains a diverse tool
kit, featuring the adze, a chisel-shaped edge tool presumed as having been used for woodworking, and specialized blades used for cutting meat and scything grass (Collins and Hester
2004) or other plants rich in silicate, as indicated by microscopic wear patterns (Inman and
Hudler 1998). This Clovis assemblage also included “ultra-thin biface” knives, traditionally
associated only with the succeeding Folsom culture (Collins and Hester 2004). Relatively few
megafaunal remains have been found associated with most of the Clovis and other early
Paleoindian associations investigated in Texas and throughout the southeast, further strengthening
the contention that Clovis bands emphasized the foraging of wild plants and small animals
(Wilmsen 1970; Smith et al. 1983:132).
The Folsom cultural complex (8900 – 8200 B.C. [Collins 2004:116, citing Haynes 1992])
represents the American Southwest’s next oldest widely known cultural horizon. The Folsom
point is a highly recognizable form, featuring several distinctive characteristics: “excellent
chipping, thinness, and distinctive flutes that have usually been removed from both sides and
extend almost to the tip.” It is generally shorter and thinner than its Clovis counterpart. Folsom’s
fluted scar, larger than that of the Clovis, always extends at least halfway up the dorsal ridge
(Turner and Hester 1985 [1999]:51, 91, 120). The Folsom complex is widely viewed to have
occupied most of the American Southwest, following the extinction of the mammoth and
mastodon and likely associated demise of the Clovis complex (Johnson and Holliday 1995:522-

9

523), although it appears not to be distributed nearly as broadly as is the Clovis. The Folsom
complex reached peak influence between 8850 and 8250 B.C. (Turner and Hester 1985 [1999]:
51). Inhabitants of the Folsom experienced “accelerated warming trend, greater seasonality,
increased annual temperature fluctuation, and widespread extinctions” (Johnson and Holliday
1995:522-523), at a time when drying conditions and possibly over hunting had eliminated the
mammoth (Drass 2003:10). Bison antiquus became the megafauna of choice (Johnson and
Holliday 1995:522-523). Collins (2004:116) maintains that “in contrast to Clovis lifeways,
subsistence in Folsom times seems to have been more reliant upon specialized hunting of big
game (bison).
During the Late Paleoindian period (8000 – 6000 B.C. [Hester 2004:134; Collins 2002]),
assemblages became much more diversified with assorted unfluted projectile point types,
including Scottsbluff, Plainview, and Angostura (Wilmsen 1970). Hester sets 6000 B.C. as the
end of the Paleoindian era, as Story (1985:29) finds this date to best represent the last of the large
lanceolate points. Later Paleoindians in Northeast and Central Texas appear to have remained
highly mobile foragers (Fields and Tomka 1993:82). Increased tool diversification during these
latest two millennia, however, represent the onset of the earliest Archaic-like cultural
manifestation, featuring new technologies in transition from earlier Paleoindian toolkits (Duffield
1963). During these succeeding phases, we see the regionalization of cultural groups. These
Archaic-like tool assemblages facilitated for the inhabitants increased production of nutritional
and other necessary resources. Populations thus expanded, triggering greater emphasis on
territoriality and a greater reliance on the local lithic resources that were inferior to the top quality
sources utilized by earlier Paleoindians (Coleman et al. 1984).
Archaic Stage (6000 B.C. – A.D. 800)
The Archaic refers to hunter-gatherer cultures which implemented regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting the environment (Muller 1983).
During this period, the
archaeological record is characterized by the introduction of gouges, manos, and metates that
indicate an increased reliance on vegetal resources. Tool kits also undergo greater diversification
and specialization. The number of sites increases during the middle and later Archaic phases.
Predominant location of sites throughout eastern Texas changes from major streams to minor
streams and natural springs (Perttula and Skiles 1986:48-53). The utilization of environmentally
specific resources made necessary the development of resource-specific tools, such as stone pipes,
mortars, pestles, and mealing stones. The Archaic artifact assemblage contains bone, shell and
copper substances (Neuman 1984). This hunting and gathering subsistence strategy, with
settlement patterns approaching semi-sedentary residency lasted until the development of pottery
and bow and arrow.
Early Ceramic (Woodland) Period (c. 500 B.C. – A.D. 1200)
Early Ceramic (Woodland) Period (c. 500 B.C. - A.D. 1200) is characterized primarily by an
increased utilization of the environment. By the end of the earliest Woodland phase, the people of
northeast Texas have increased their reliance on cultigens (corn and squash) and are remaining
longer at specific locales. Gradual shifts toward more permanent settlements had been occurring
since about 2000 B.C. Long distance exchange networks were probably in full operation, as
copper, marine shell, and other raw materials were imported from thousands of kilometers distant
(Sabo and Early 1988:73). During the early Woodland phase, populations residing throughout
greater eastern Texas were within the sphere of influence of complex cultural groups in Louisiana.
Poverty Point was still a powerful cultural force to the east, no doubt interacting and influencing
groups in Northeast Texas. These changes evolved out of ancestral Archaic traditions.

10

The earliest appearances of ceramics and the bow-and-arrow in Texas occurred in the extreme
northeast and in the far west between 500 B.C. and A.D. 1. For northeast Texas, the “Woodland
Stage” is employed to explain Texas’ earliest known ceramic-bearing area, as activities related to
the Tchefuncte culture of Louisiana (ca. 500 B.C. – A.D. 1) produced documented manifestations as
far west as the Red River basin of Northeast Texas (Gregory and Curry 1978:43; Neuman 1984).
By middle Woodland times, pottery—specifically, sand tempered ware—had become common
throughout greater eastern Texas and northwest Louisiana. Horticulture became more indispensable
to overall food procurement with widespread production and storage of domesticated maize, squash,
and gourds (Newman 1984). By later Woodland years, arrow points utilized in the long bow have
become dominant over the larger dart points utilized throughout the Archaic in the atlatl (Perttula
and Skiles 1986: 53-54; Story 1990: 249). The Woodland concludes with the widespread use of
bow and arrow and a broad variety of ceramics (Story et al. 1990) throughout eastern Texas.
Late Prehistoric Period (c. A.D. 800 – A.D. 1680)
Late Prehistoric Period (c. A.D. 800 - A.D. 1680) is distinguished by the emergence of distinctive
cultural sequences along the eastern margins of Texas from core areas of these cultural complexes
in Louisiana (i.e. Tchefuncte, Marksville, Troyville-Coles Creek, Poverty Point, Plaquemine, and
Mississippian). The indigenous development of the Caddo cultural system in Northeast Texas and
adjoining regions is strongly influenced by the Mississippian tradition of the Lower Mississippi
Valley (Story 1990:323). The indigenous people comprising earliest Caddo communities appear to
have arisen from local populations rather than from migrations from the Lower Mississippi Valley.
Caddo culture, to the near-exclusion of other indigenous complexes, proliferated in northeast Texas
throughout the Late Prehistoric stage. The Caddo tradition exhibited continuity along the traits of
house site construction and subsistence practices. Houses were circular, as demonstrated by
excavated post mold patterns from the Hanna Site (16RR4) and the Werner Mound site (16BO8)
(Thomas et al. 1980:111, Webb 1983:219-221). Floral and faunal remains recovered from Caddoan
sites are maize, squash, gourd, hickory nut, acorns, deer, and a variety of other mammalian and
aquatic fauna. This represents a particularly wide variety of subsistence foods being exploited
(Jeter and Williams, Jr. 1989:202). Caddo subsistence and social organization differ markedly from
the previous periods. Horticulture and then agriculture supplemented hunting and gathering. Larger
aggregates of people became sedentary and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas in the
early years but an absence of ceremonial mounds in later years of the Caddo cultural sequence
(Miller et al 2000). Cemeteries are found in association with large ceremonial mounds. Extensive
commercial networks also were established. Each large mound center accompanied by large
community burial grounds is surrounded by several smaller mound centers accompanied by few if
any community cemeteries. Regional cultural systems exhibiting this settlement pattern have been
associated with chiefdoms. Service (1962, 1975) was first to define a stratified social structure
corresponding to the chiefdom level of socio-political organizational order.
Protohistoric Period (A.D. 1541 – A.D. 1690)
Protohistoric Period (A.D. 1541 - A.D. 1690) represents the earliest contacts with European
explorers, soldiers, trappers and traders, and adventurers. Although claims to northeast Texas were
disputed between the Spanish colonies in Mesoamerica and Cuba and the French colony of Quebec,
no European frontier settlement existed within 1,500 miles of this region until the 1680s. Caddo
populations were depleted in the future Harrison County by 1690, due largely to epidemics of
diseases even though contact with Europeans was very rare. By the 1820s, Cherokee had inhabited

11

this area from east of the Mississippi River. In 1839, Texas president Mirabeau Lamar expelled the
Cherokee from the Republic, forcing them to return north of the Red River, using the Cherokee
Trace and the Jefferson-Dallas Road (Kirby 2001).
Historic Period (1690 – present)
During the Historic Period (1690 – present), northeast Texas transitioned from domination by
native peoples to European settlement and the subsequent establishment of farms, towns, and
counties. The land was initially inhabited by the confederacies of the Hasinais and other Caddo
groups during this period. These groups of allied confederations were known as the Timber
Tribes (LaGrone 1979). They resided in farming villages, raising grain and vegetables and
hunting for small game in the forests. They also constructed burial mounds.
Spain and France both claimed the area during the European colonization of the New World. The
former established a line of protected missions located approximately 100 miles south of Harrison
County. The explorations of René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle formed the basis to
France’s claim. European weapons and disease decimated the indigenous populations making
American settlement in the area relatively peaceful (Campbell 1983). The Caddo, the indigenous
culture of northeastern Texas since before 1000 A.D., offered little resistance to Anglo-American
settlers, which arrived in large numbers beginning in the 1830s. By 1835, a dozen Americans had
received land grants from Mexican authorities. Following establishment of the Texas Republic,
this area gained sufficient population for the new nation’s Congress to officially establish
Harrison County – drawn from Shelby County – in 1839 (Campbell 2007).
Founded on January 30, 1841, (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004), Marshall – named by Isaac Van Zandt
in honor of United States Chief Justice John Marshall, was laid out with the intention of
becoming the seat of Harrison County and ultimately a significant city of East Texas. Peter
Whetstone offered tracts for a church, school, and future courthouse. Because of Whetstone’s
offer of a courthouse, County officials made Marshall the county seat in 1842. The City of
Marshall was incorporated in 1844 and enlarged “…to include an area of one square mile with the
courthouse at the center”. In 1854, Marshall became Texas’ first town to have telegraph service,
located at the local newspaper’s office. By 1860, Marshall had approximately 2,000 inhabitants
(Campbell 2007) and was the fifth largest city in Texas and East Texas’ first metropolis
(Anonymous 2007).
The economy was primarily based on the southern cotton plantation way of life. In 1850,
Harrison County had more slaves than any other in Texas. Cotton was so successful that by
1860, the census records for the county record a slave population of 8,784 (59 percent of the total
population and still with the greatest number of all counties in Texas), 145 plantation owners
owning at least 20 bondsmen, and a cotton crop of 21,440 bales (Campbell 2007) making
Harrison County the wealthiest and most productive in Antebellum Texas (Campbell 1983).
Harrison County, as a whole, strongly favored succession from the Union, as encouraged by the
pro-secession newspaper, the Marshall Texas Republican (Campbell 2007). Once the war began,
Harrison County sent many troops and contributing materials to the war effort (Campbell 1983).
The first and last governors of Texas as a Confederate state, Edward Clark and Pendleton Murrah,
were from Marshall. The Confederate government of the State of Missouri was relocated to
Marshall (Campbell 2007). Under Missouri governance, Marshall produced gunpowder and
other needs for the Confederate Army (Anonymous 2007).

12

After the Civil War, Harrison County remained rural and agricultural. The economy, based on
primarily on cotton, continued to be lucrative for the county well into the early 20th century
(Campbell 1983). The population grew from 25,171 to 48,397 during these decades, with the
number of farms increasing from 2,748 to 6,802. African Americans remained in the majority,
with over 60 percent of the population from 1880 to 1930 (Campbell 2007).
The county’s economy began to diversify as the state’s burgeoning railroad industry found
Harrison County as a useful crossroads. The Texas Western Railroad was chartered in 1852 to
connect Caddo Lake and Marshall. In 1856 its name was changed to “Southern Pacific Railroad
Company” (“local” SP), which was not related to the more famous “Southern Pacific” (SP)
extending from Louisiana to California. In 1858, the “local” SP completed that long-proposed
line connecting Marshall with Swanson’s Landing. This line, constructed in 1858 or immediately
thereafter, represents the earliest railway construction in Harrison County.
The next rail company to be established along this ROW was the Texas Pacific Railroad
Company, chartered in 1871 to connect Marshall and San Diego, California (Marshall Depot Inc.
2004). This became the major east-west link through Harrison County, connecting Shreveport
with Dallas and Fort Worth (Campbell 2007). In 1872, the United States Congress changed the
name to Texas & Pacific Railway Company (T&P), the state’s only federally chartered rail
company (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004).
By 1881, the T&P had completed its largest segment, a 522-mile stretch of track west of Fort
Worth to Sierra Blanca. From there, T&P trains were permitted, according to an agreement
forged by T&P’s president,Jay Gould to use Southern Pacific tracks to El Paso and beyond,
thereby forming a continuous line from Marshall to the west coast (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004).
Before 1900, T&P headquarters were relocated to Fort Worth, leaving its 66 acres of shops in
Marshall. With the discovery of oil in eastern Texas, rail transportation dramatically increased.
During World War II, record traffic movements were recorded through Harrison County, all of
which enhanced Marshall’s prosperity. The depot’s interior was modernized to handle increased
travelers in the 1930s, including a pedestrian tunnel under the tracks southward to the historic
Ginocchio Hotel (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004).
Sometime after World War II, the T&P shops were closed in Marshall. These service facilities
were geared to the maintenance of steam locomotives. As diesel engines emerged as the
dominant source of power for pulling trains, the Marshall shops became obsolete, causing them to
close. In 1970, the T&P ended passenger service to Marshall. The famous depot remained out of
service until Amtrak commenced passenger service in 1974. In 1976, the T&P was merged with
the Missouri Pacific Railroad (MP), and this company was absorbed by the Union Pacific (UP) in
1982 (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004). The majority of those rail lines constructed by the T&P from
1871 to 1882 remain in operation under the UP today, including the ROW running east-to-west
located one-half mile south of this project’s survey area.
The black majority began declining as a result of the effects of the Great Depression which forced
numerous African Americans employed in agriculture to leave the county and seek work larger
cities (Campbell 1983). This trend continued and was reinforced by World War II as more
employment opportunities were made available in the industrial sector. The railroad transformed
Marshall into a major retail center, with its population by 1930 reaching 16,203 and
manufacturing establishments employing 2,319 workers. For the first time in 1940, more county
workers derived income from nonagricultural occupations, including government-funded public
emergency works (Campbell 2007).

13

As a traditionally black-majority area, Marshall was a center of civil rights activity. Marshall
resident Herman Sweatt, the first African American student at the University of Texas at Austin,
entered Law School in 1950 under orders of the Texas Supreme Court. Marshall native James L.
Farmer, Jr. organized the Freedom Rides and helped found the Congress of Racial Equality
during the 1960s. African American students in Marshall organized the first sit-ins to have
occurred in Texas, which took place in the rotunda of the Harrison County courthouse, to
desegregate Marshall public schools (Anonymous 2007).
For those who remained on the farm, quality of life significantly improved. The Panola-Harrison
Electric Cooperative began providing electrical service in 1937. Beginning in 1928, the
production of oil and natural gas has steadily increased economic effect for property owners. By
1978, only one farmer continued to produce cotton, as agriculture by this time was dominated by
cattle raising and mixed cultivation (Campbell 2007).
In Marshall, small-scale manufacturing of metal, wood, and clay products provided almost half of
the employment for Harrison County. For both the city and throughout the rural areas of the
county, education rose dramatically, with 23 percent of adults over 24 being high school
graduates in 1950 but with this figure rising to 42 percent by 1970 and over 50 percent by 1980.
The three decades following World War II witnessed significant population declines for the
county, but by 1980, the county’s population dramatically rose to 52,265, with the City of
Marshall attaining for the first time 24,921. By 2000, the county recorded 62,110, with 23,935
residing in Marshall. Hallsville and Wascom each had more than 2000 residents by 2000. By
this time, tourism was increasing in economic importance, with main attractions being Caddo
Lake State Park, Lake O’ The Pines (Campbell 2007), and the museums housed in the restored
Marshall Depot and Ginnochio Hotel complex (Marshall Depot Inc. 2004).
This project area is located within the city limits of Longview and approximately three miles to
the northwest of the City of Hallsville. The earliest recorded settlement in this area was Fort
Crawford, built in 1839 one mile west of present-day Hallsville and less than two miles southwest
of the survey area. This installation, erected by W. C. Crawford to offer protection against Indian
attacks and raids, grew into a town with a post office and two-story public building serving as a
church and Masonic hall. This school remained western Harrison County’s only children’s
educational institution until Fort Crawford’s demise after the Civil War (Lentz 2008).
In 1869, the Southern Pacific established a temporary terminus named “Hallville,” east of the
Gregg County. A post office, saloon, and railroad general office and machine shops were
established. The boomtown, incorporated in 1870, soon had accumulated some 50 commercial
establishments to support the shipping of cotton, wool, and hides. With the extension of the
railroad to what became Longview in 1872, Hallville rapidly lost much of this business. The next
year, the new railroad company moved its shops to Marshall, and most of its population moved to
the county seat. By 1884, the remaining 600 residents were using three churches, six sawmills,
six cotton gin/grist mill complexes, two saloons, one hotel, and a cooperative association. By
1909, a bank had opened, and separate public schools for white and African American children
were flourishing (Lentz 2008).
During the 1920s, the post office changed the official name to “Hallsville,” and the community
was re-incorporated in 1935 following years during which municipal government had become
inactive. The population fluctuated from 300 to 700 from the 1880s to the 1930s, before
exceeding 1,000 during the 1940s. By 2000, the town’s population was 2,772, with number of
businesses growing from 20 in 1966 to 31 in 1988 (Lentz 2008).

RESEARCH DESIGN
Sphere 3 performed all necessary cultural resources investigations in connection with the
Hallsville ISD K-4 Elementary School campus construction undertaking. These investigations
were conducted to locate prehistoric and historic cultural resources sites within the property,
delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, and make preliminary evaluations of each
site's integrity and potential for SAL designation and/or NRHP eligibility.
Prior to initiating the fieldwork, Sphere 3 acquired a Texas Antiquities Permit. Sphere 3
conducted a records search for SALs, Historic Markers, properties listed on or eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP, previously recorded sites documented at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL), as officially managed by THC, previous survey reports available
online through the Texas Archeological Site Atlas (TASA). Topographic maps, aerial images,
and Google Earth imagery from the past 70 years was analyzed for modern and historic impacts
to the property.
The pedestrian cultural resources survey relied on both visual examination and shovel testing.
The visual examination focused on areas with exposed soil surfaces (e.g., tire tracks, animal
disturbances, etc.). Per the THC’s standards, project areas between 11 - 100 ac require a
minimum of one shovel test for every two acres; therefore, 19 shovel tests are the minimum
requirement for the 37.35 acre project area. All shovel tests were excavated in 10 cm levels down
to the clay substrate with the deepest test at 122 cmbs to reach the clay layer. The excavated
matrix was screened through a 0.635 cm (0.25 in) wire mesh screen. Shovel test locations were
recorded with a GPS capable of one meter (m) (3.28 feet [ft]) accuracy. For each shovel test unit,
notes were made in the shovel test form of soil color, texture, and extent of soil layers and of the
maximum depth.
Upon finding an artifact, shovel tests were excavated solely within the project area boundaries at
approximately 20.0 m (65.6 ft) intervals or less until the site limits could be delineated using
surface features/artifacts or two consecutive negative shovel tests. Surface features were mapped
with a GPS. Photos were taken of the site area. A soil profile was described from a positive
shovel test on the site, and a State of Texas Archeological Site Data Form was completed for each
new site discovered. Sub-surface artifacts were collected by shovel test number and 10 cm (3.9
in) level.
In the case of a historic site for which an unusual abundance of certain classes of non-diagnostic
fragments of bottle glass, iron, brick, or other common material are found on the surface, only
representative samples shall be required to be collected and curated in accordance with State
Antiquities Permit guidelines. All diagnostic historic and other historic cultural objects recovered
during investigations that do not meet these criteria, as well as all prehistoric cultural objects,
were collected.
Following completion of the field survey, all collected artifacts were washed, cataloged and
analyzed to determine cultural affiliation. Site forms, artifacts, maps and photographs, along with
documents containing other field data shall be curated at Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas.

RESULTS
This cultural resource investigation was conducted under the Antiquities Code of Texas. No
federal funding or permitting was involved. The cultural resources investigations for the
proposed development included an analysis of topographic maps and aerial imagery from the past
70 years followed by an intensive pedestrian survey. Soil profiles of all excavated shovel tests
are found in Appendix A: Table 1. Field specimens collected during the investigation are
recorded in Appendix A: Tables 2 and 3. The investigations were successful in documenting two
sites, Site 41H1024 and Site 41HS1025. Shovel test forms, collected field specimens, and other
archival materials containing documentation comprising the Texas Antiquities Permit 9146
project shall be curated at TARL.

IMAGERY AND TOPOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS
Google Earth aerial imagery; historic aerial imagery from 1949, 1957, and 1975 (Figures 4, 5,
and 6); and topographic maps, including: 1964, 1962 Photorevised in 1978, and 2019 (Figures 7,
2, and 8 respectively), illustrate the modern use of the project area and its immediate
surroundings. The area of western Harrison County encompassing the Hallsville ISD K – 4
School project is drained by an unnamed tributary of Mason Creek.
In general, the project area may have been used for agricultural purposes or was otherwise
undeveloped during 1949. A large pond is constructed in the project area from the tributary of
Mason Creek between 1964 and 1975. No structures appear to be located within the project area
at this time. In 1957 the area is still largely undeveloped; however, a group of four structures and
a possible fifth have been constructed within the project area in what is currently the vacant lot on
Page Road, the location of Site 41HS1025. Two more structures can be seen immediately to the
east of the project area. The 1964 topographic map confirms the presence of four structures as
well as two more structures to the two to the east. The 1975 aerial reveals that the four structures
in the vacant lot have been demolished or otherwise removed from the project area. Several other
structures have been constructed along the western boundary, outside the project area, of the
vacant lot area and along Page Road to the east of the project area. The 1978 topographic map
confirms the presence of these new structures as well as illustrating a structure once again within
the vacant lot area of the project area. Google Earth aerial imagery from 1995 to the present was
also reviewed. The vacant lot area appears empty in 1995. In 2005 there appears to be two
objects in the lot however the aerial is too blurry to make out what the objects are. The vacant lot
is once again empty in 2009 nine and remains empty to the present. A house appears on the aerial
imagery between 1995 and 2005 centrally located within the project area off East Loop 281. The
house appears to have been demolished, leaving only the concrete foundation pad between 2017
and 2019.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY SUPPORTED BY SHOVEL TESTING
The project area was visually inspected by pedestrian survey at a maximum of 30 meter (m) (98.4
feet [ft]) transect intervals. Visual inspection was supported by shovel testing at set intervals, in
accordance with guidelines issued by the THC. The bulk of the project area is substantially
removed from perennial waters and associated landforms typically preferred for habitation or
food exploitation by indigenous people mostly in the prehistoric era or by Euro-American settlers,
farmers, and town dwellers of the historic era. These lands consequently are assessed as being of
“low probability” for finding archaeological sites or noteworthy architectural buildings and
structures. In contrast, portions of the project area approach either an unnamed tributary of

Mason Creek or the remnants of structures built more than 50 years ago (standing, demolished, or
moved), as demonstrated by topographic and aerial imagery background research. These areas
were assessed as “high probability” for finding archaeological resources.
Shovel testing was conducted to conform with THC guidelines of two shovel tests per acre with
additional shovel tests added in “high probability” areas. A total of 81 shovel tests were
excavated across the project area (Figure 9). These field survey operations resulted in the
identification of two sites, 41HS1024 and 41HS1025, and several aboveground locations of
cultural activity within the past 50 years. Description of the results of the survey follows,
generally from north to south within the project area. Since the two sites are found along the
project area’s south boundary, they will be presented at the end of this section.
The project area north of the unnamed tributary and associated large pond is characterized by a
mixed hardwood/pine forest split by a cleared transmission line corridor overgrown with small
saplings, briars, and other various forms of underbrush (Appendix B: Photographs 1 and 3). The
landscape in this northern portion consists of a gently southeasterly sloping landscape descending
toward the unnamed tributary. A small patch of near impenetrable hardwood forest was
encountered along the northeastern project area boundaries in the vicinity of shovel tests 2, 3, and
4 (Appendix B: Photograph 5).
A cultural locality consisting of a concrete foundation pad surrounded by a relatively light scatter
of related modern trash was discovered in this northern area along the eastern boundary of the
project area and approximately 70 m (230 ft) north of the pond (Figure 9 and Appendix B:
Photograph 6). This foundation represents the remains of a house constructed and subsequently
demolished at this location and even retains some flooring tile (Appendix B: Photograph 7) and a
green electrical connection box. Hallsville ISD tax records and Google Earth aerial imagery
indicated that the residence was constructed and occupied during the 1990s and demolished
between 2017 and 2019. The concrete pad measures approximately 18.8 m (62 ft) by 12.5 m (41
ft) and sits atop an artificially raised rectangular terrace. A large pile of modern machine-made
brick with three core holes and a few broken buckets and flowerpot liners (labeled as Brick Pile 1
in Figure 9) was observed north of the concrete foundation (Appendix B: Photograph 8). A
smaller concrete foundation associated with PVC piping rising out of the concrete and an
overturned hot-water heater was also observed north of the concrete foundation and east of the
brick pile. A gravel driveway extends from the house site to Loop 281. Because of its
construction, usage, and demolition within the past 50 years, this home site was not considered an
archaeological site, and no field specimens were collected due to the very modern (i.e. less than
50 years) nature of the occupation and surrounding cultural materials.
Soils north of the unnamed tributary consisted of generally an organic humus/root layer over fine
sandy loam or sandy loam overlaying clay subsoils. Depths of shovel tests ranged from 20 to 107
cmbs (7.9 to 42.1 inbs) forming a general pattern of soils along the western border of the project
area becoming shallower toward the eastern boundary (Appendix B: Photographs 2 and 4). A
few anomalies to this pattern were encountered. Shovel test 13 hit clay subsoil at 10 cm (3.9 in).
Shovel tests 9 and 10 were excavated on the artificial terrace built for the concrete foundation pad
and exhibited heavily disturbed clay or sandy clay soils for the first 20 to 30 cm (7.9 to 11.8 in)
(Appendix B: Photograph 9). Shovel tests 17 and 18 excavated on the east side of the project
area on the edge of the terrace and toeslope descending to the small floodplain of the tributary
proved to contain very deep fine sandy loams or loamy sands.
An approximately one-acre pond with an earthen dam is located in the southeastern section of the
project area. (Appendix B: Photographs 13 and 14). Analysis of historic topo maps and aerials

indicate that the pond was created between 1964 and 1975. No other features or artifacts were
found in association with the earthen dam. For this fact and the possibility that the dam and pond
may be less than 50 years of age, the dam was not deemed worthy of recordation as an
archaeological site.
Soils south of the pond consisted of shallow fine sandy loams or sandy clay loams over yellow
brown or reddish clay (Appendix B: Photograph 15). East of the pond and south of the unnamed
tributary, soils consisted of deep fine sandy loams or loamy sands over clay along a toeslope
above the tributary on which was discovered Site 41HS1024 (further details found in site
description). Shovel test 44, excavated near the transmission corridor and south of the unnamed
tributary, found a return to deeper fine sandy loams which continued southwest.
A trash dump containing late 20th century materials was observed and documented within western
end of the stream channel (Debris Pile 1 and 2 in Figure 9). The garbage dump consisted of
materials likely less than 50 years old such as floor tiles, aluminum siding, plastic soda bottles,
newspapers, wooden planks, tires, brick, concrete, sheet metal, and rusted 55-gallon drums
(Appendix B: Photographs 16 and 17). Because of the absence of cultural objects in excess of 50
years of age, this locality deemed as unworthy of recordation as an archaeological site.
Numerous aluminum beer can pull-tabs and colorless glass shards were located in the
southwestern portion of the project area near shovel test 70. None of these curved glass
fragments exhibited patina or scratches indicating a lengthy duration in a subsurface context. A
trailer containing beer cans and glass bottles was parked nearby the shovel test (Appendix B:
Photograph 31). The registration on the trailer’s license plate read 2002. This locality, as
including both the top layer of shovel test 70 and the abandoned trailer, was interpreted as a
modern dump site.
Site 41HS1024
Site 41HS1024 is an especially low-density, two-component historic and indeterminate
prehistoric subsurface scatter situated along the southern limits of the Hallsville ISD tract project
area (Figure 10). The northern limits were found to follow the south bank of the unnamed
tributary. The tributary lies less than 20 m (65.6 ft) north of the site’s north margins. The eastern
limits terminate along a steeply sloping toeslope into a floodplain associated with the tributary
and a small ephemeral headwaters stream into the tributary from south of the project area. The
western limits terminate along the west margins of a gradually undulating upland terrace. The
southern boundary could not be determined due to the site likely extending south of the project
area. As mapped within the project area, the site measures approximately 92 m (303 ft) east-west
and approximately 37 m (121 ft) north-south. The presence of two positive units along the south
boundary of the tract owned by Hallsville ISD indicates that the site potentially extends south of
the project area.
Vegetation at the site is comprised of a mix of pines and hardwoods with dense underbrush and
vines (Appendix B: Photograph 12). The site was found to extend southward beyond the project
area into two residential lots that have been largely cleared of trees and brush. Soils in the upland
portion of the site generally consisted of four basic layers: (1) Loose fine sandy loam humus
associated with leaf litter, (2) Loose fine sandy loam associated with tree roots, (3) Compact fine
loamy sand with high groundwater content associated with fewer although larger tree roots, and
(4) Sandy clay to thick mottled clay of increasing compaction with depth. Soils in the floodplain
of the tributary consisted of a small humus layer followed by inundated sandy clay loam.

Five of the 25 shovel tests excavated at the site were positive. Four shovel tests (20, 27, 32, and
77) were found to contain a combined total of four secondary and one tertiary chert flake
fragments recovered from between 0 and 60 cmbs (0 and 23.6 inbs) (Appendix B: Photograph
32). The historic component consists of two glass artifacts – one flat mirror shard and one
unusually thick colorless flat glass shard – found in shovel test 78, adjacent to the adjoining
residential lot to the south (Appendix B: Photograph 33). All discovered field specimens were
collected and recorded with respect to provenience in Appendix A: Table 2. No artifacts were
observed on the ground surface.
The low artifact count combined with the unusually high number of negative units illustrate the
markedly low density of this subsurface scatter. With the absence of diagnostic artifacts or
features or other physical anomalies holding potential for being formed culturally, the portions of
this site found within the project area were assessed as having little or no research value. The
investigated portion of Site 41HS1024 thus is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and not eligible for designation as a SAL within the project area. No further cultural
resources work at this site is recommended.
Site 41HS1025
Site 41HS1025 is an overall low-density subsurface and surface historic artifact scatter located in
a square shaped vacant lot along Page Road (Figure 11). The site fills in the squarish vacant lot
and extends in triangular form northward past the lot proper to encompass three construction
material debris piles and one machine-made brick and mortar pile labeled as Debris Piles 3, 4,
and 5 and Brick Pile 2 in Figure 4. The vacant lot measures approximately 67 m (220 ft) northsouth and 85 m (280 ft) east-west. The triangular area measures 76 m (250 ft) due north of the
northeast corner of the squarish lot and 98 m (320 ft) east-west.
Vegetation consisted of short to tall grasses with small clumps of ornamental bulbs in the open
area of the vacant lot (Appendix B: Photograph 18). The triangular-shaped north part of the site
was observed to become more wooded, with a mix of pines and various hardwood trees,
increased underbrush, and decreased grasses (Appendix B: Photograph 22). Soils in the site
consisted mainly of fine sandy loam or loamy sand extending to depths of between 14 and 50 cm
(Appendix B: Photograph 19). Shovel tests 58, 63, 65, and 67 along the northeastern boundary of
the delineated border were found to have a red clay cap underlying the humus layer (Appendix B:
Photograph 20).
The entire surface area of the site was inspected for surface finds and features. The only cultural
objects observed on the ground surface were a few scattered modern bricks, three debris piles and
one brick pile. The debris piles contain modern materials such as concrete blocks, cinderblocks,
machine-made brick, electrical wiring, tires, wooden fence posts, rubber garden hoses, terracotta
pipes, beer cans, plastic, rebar, and other rusted metal objects (Appendix B: Photographs 23
through 30). The limits of this north area were determined by encompassing these garbage piles
by a 10-meter perimeter. All five shovel tests excavated in direct association with these debris or
brick piles (shovel tests 46, 74, 75, 72, and 71) were negative, thus revealing no subsurface
expression of this part of the site.
The site is bounded on the south by Page Road. Shovel testing of the site was contained to the
project area and consequently the east and west boundary could not be fully delineated. The
vacant lot has been maintained for many years with occasional mowing. Amid the several trees
and grasses were observed several small growth areas of bulb plantings from previous years of
use as a yard associated with a private residence. Historic aerial imagery and topographic maps

show five separate structures in the vacant lot from the mid to late 20th century. Four of these
can be seen on aerial imagery from 1957 and a topographic map form 1964 and appear to have
been a single farmstead; however, the fifth, seen on a topographic map from 1978, could be a
separate later occupation. These structures have all been demolished or moved in the past leaving
the grassy vacant lot with a few scattered trees. Page Road appears on the earliest available
imagery indicating that the road was built prior to the 1950s. Thus, occupants of vehicles
traversing this road may have begun littering adjacent fields with beverage bottles and other
unwelcomed garbage for more than 70 years.
A total of 44 historic-era artifacts were recovered from the ten positive shovel tests (Appendix A:
Table 3). Depth of recovery ranged from between 0 and 50.0 cmbs (0 and 19.7 inbs). Artifact
types offering chronological information include: two aqua flat glass shards, likely from window
panes, indicating architectural activity during the 19th and early 20th centuries; three iron wire
nails, indicating architectural activity at the earliest very late 19th and throughout the 20th
century; modern machine-made brick with core cylindrical holes, indicating architectural activity
in the 20th century; 1 Light Bulb Colorless Glass, indicating domestic activity during the 20th
century; and 1 Plastic fragment, indicating indeterminate activity in the 20th century. Nondiagnostic finds included one iron pipe, one tiny undecorated whiteware sherd, and numerous
fragments of colorless vessel glass, brick with no distinguishing attributes other than flat external
faces, indeterminate nails, and sandstone and limestone fragments interpreted as not reflective of
naturally occurring rocks and thus intentionally brought to this site for meeting unidentified
cultural needs. A representative sample of brick fragments recovered from shovel testing will be
retained for permanent curation; however, two large pieces of redundant brick recovered from
shovel test 53 and assorted other finds with high probability of being less than 50 years old shall
be excluded from curation and discarded, as per Chapter 26, Subchapter C, RULE §26.17,
(f)(2)(B) Objects that lack historical, cultural, or scientific value. Photographs of the two
fragments are found in Appendix B: Photographs 38 and 39.
Overall density is low, in contrast to many early 20th century historic archaeological sites in
northeast Texas. With the absence of culturally formed features or other physical anomalies
relating to intact structural remnants, this site is assessed as having little or no research value.
The investigated portion of Site 41HS1025 is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and not eligible for designation as a SAL within the project area. No further cultural
resources work at this site is recommended.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In summary, approximately 15.12 ha (37.35 ac) was surveyed to assess for existing cultural
resources in the proposed Hallsville ISD K-4 Elementary School APE in Longview, Harrison
County, Texas. Texas Antiquities Permit #9146 was obtained and all stipulations of the permit,
as mandated under the Antiquities Code of Texas, were completed. The goal of the survey was to
identify cultural resources and to make a preliminary evaluation of the documented cultural
resources as to their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and for being designated as a SAL.
The investigations conducted by Sphere 3 included an examination of previous archaeological
and other cultural resources investigations within one mile of the project area, an historical sketch
of each prehistoric, protohistoric, and historic period of Harrison County and the northeast Texas
region, an analysis of aerial imagery and topographic maps over the past 70 years, and an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey supported by systematic shovel testing of the project

28

area. A total of 81 shovel tests were excavated. Shovel testing led to the discovery and
recordation of two archaeological sites. Site 41HS1024 is an indeterminate prehistoric and
historic subsurface scatter, and Site 41HS1025 is an early to mid-20th century historic residential
location.
Site 41HS1024 is a very low-density subsurface scatter of five prehistoric chert flakes recovered
from four shovel tests and two pieces of historic period glass recovered from a single shovel test.
The historic artifacts consist of a colorless flat glass shard and a colorless glass mirror shard. The
site was located on a series of raised landforms along the southern bank of an unnamed tributary
of Mason Creek. A full southern boundary could not be established because the boundary of the
project area was reached. Due to the extremely low-density of artifacts, lack of any diagnostic
materials, and the absence of any cultural features, the portion of Site 41HS1024 that was
investigated within the project area is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and
not eligible for designation as a SAL.
Site 41HS1025 is an overall low-density early to mid-20th century subsurface and surface scatter
of historic cultural materials. The site was initially identified in the square shaped vacant lot on
Page Road and was found to extend northward into mixed pine/hardwood forest. The portion of
the site in the vacant lot has likely been disturbed by occasional lawn maintenance and clearing of
vegetation. Three debris piles of middle to late 20th century materials and one brick pile of high
fired machine-made brick were located in the northern portion of the site. Due to the overall low
density and absence of any intact structural or architectural features, the portions of Site
41HS1025 that were investigated within the project area are recommended as not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and not eligible for designation as a SAL.
Both sites 41HS1024 and 41HS1025 appear to extend outside the project area. Those areas
beyond the Hallsville ISD holdings remain unevaluated and potentially may be eligible for
designation as a SAL and for listing in the NRHP.
Four other cultural localities were located by the survey. The first of these areas was a home site
containing a concrete foundation pad and associated scatter of debris constructed during the
1990s and demolished between 2017 and 2019. The second was a pond and associated earthen
dam constructed between 1964 and 1975. No cultural objects were found to be associated with
the construction of the dam. The third locality was a modern garbage dump consisting of two
piles in close vicinity in the channel of the unnamed tributary of Mason Creek. The fourth
locality consisted of a small scatter of beer can pull-tabs and colorless glass shards found in the
uppermost humus layer of shovel test 70. These four localities were assessed as likely less than
50 years of age and thus unworthy of being recorded as archaeological sites.
Sphere 3 requests the Texas Historical Commission, which serves as the State Historic
Preservation Office for Texas, to concur with these evaluations of non-eligibility and thus to
concur with the determination of “no effect” to historic properties listed on or eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP and those listed as or eligible for designation as a SAL. No further
cultural resources work at this site is recommended, and construction activities may proceed
without further consultation with the THC.
