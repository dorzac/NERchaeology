ABSTRACT

This preliminary report describes historical research and an intensive archeological survey
conducted for a 4.9-mile-long stretch of FM 2092 in Menard County by Prewitt and Associates, Inc.
The work was performed for the Texas Department of Transportation in conjunction with a road
improvement project beginning at the eastern Menard city limit and extending eastward to just
beyond Fivemile Crossing. Crossing over Pleistocene and Holocene alluvial terraces of the San Saba
River, the project area is located in a high-probability area for buried prehistoric sites and has a
dynamic history of intensive use since Spanish colonial times. Investigations included
geoarcheological mapping, historic research and evaluation, pedestrian survey, backhoe and gradall
trenching, mechanical auger testing, and shovel testing.
Archeological remains of 10 previously recorded sites and 9 newly discovered sites were
documented within the FM 2092 right of way. Of these 19 sites, 6 have prehistoric components, 4
have historic components, and 9 have both prehistoric and historic components. At 14 of the 15 sites
with prehistoric components, either no prehistoric remains were found within the right of way or
the prehistoric remains are very low density and extensively disturbed. No prehistoric features
were encountered at any of these 14 sites. The prehistoric components at these 14 sites (41MN5,
41MN9, 41MN11, 41MN12, 41MN15, 41MN23, 41MN53, 41MN54, and 41MN56–61) were
recommended as not eligible for listing in the National Register, while the portion of 41MN55 inside
the right of way was recommended as eligible. Site 41MN55 was subsequently tested, and the results
of this work are reported separately.
At 11 of the 13 sites with historic components, either no historic remains were found within
the right of way or historic remains were limited to nondiagnostic artifacts (i.e., that could date to
the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries) in disturbed contexts. Although intact deposits
and historic features associated with these sites may be present outside the right of way, none were
observed in the right of way. It was recommended that these 11 sites (41MN5, 41MN9, 41MN10,
41MN12, 41MN13, 41MN15, 41MN20, 41MN53, 41MN54, 41MN60, and 41MN61) are not eligible
for listing in the National Register.
During this survey, hand and mechanical excavations were conducted at 41MN23, the site
of the historic Mission San Sabá. The portion of the site within the FM 2092 right of way was
recommended as eligible for listing in the National Register. Intensive data recovery excavations
were subsequently conducted, but these investigations are reported separately.
Site 41MN21 is the Menard Irrigation Company canal and associated smaller lateral ditches
that comprise the entire irrigation system. Historical research documents that construction of this
canal system started in 1874 and expanded in the late 1800s. The system is still used for agricultural
irrigation today. Portions of the irrigation system crossing the FM 2092 right of way were documented.
The system is probably eligible for listing in the National Register, but the irrigation system will not
be impacted by this road project, and no further work is recommended.

CURATION

All project records generated by this survey project will be submitted for permanent curation
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin. For this project,
PAI employed a general no-collection policy. Selected diagnostic artifacts were collected from 41MN55,
but they will be curated with materials from a subsequent testing project.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

A multidisciplinary approach was used to research and survey this particularly historic 5­
mile section of Texas roadway. Researchers, state workers, local informants as well as archeologists
were brought together to offer information regarding the rich history of this area.
The cultural resources studies conducted by PAI were directly supervised by the Archeological
Studies Program, Cultural Resources Management Section at the Environmental Affairs Division,
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT-ENV). John Arnn served as project manager and Jim
Abbott assisted with geomorphology concerns. Personnel from the TxDOT San Angelo District Office
included Nancy Fisher and Ann Maxwell of the ENV Department and Public Information Officer
Karen Threlkeld. Emiliano Gonzales of the Menard Maintenance Office scheduled auger, backhoe,
and gradall services and handled safety coordination. Guy Wagoner was especially helpful with
fulfilling any of our TxDOT needs while we were in the field.
Consultants Kay Hindes (historian), Mark Wolf (historian), Dr. Grant Hall (archeologist,
Texas Tech University), and Dr. William Doolittle (geographer and irrigation system specialist,
University of Texas at Austin) shared their research, expertise, and time. Dr. Jake Landers, a local
landowner and TAMU extension range specialist, conducted research on graves located along the
FM 2092 corridor and offered his knowledge of the estimated ages of trees along FM 2092. Alicia
Brown, who maintains the Menard County TexGenWeb Project web page, was also helpful in providing
information about the graves. Dora Wright, also a local genealogy researcher, offered access to
publications from her personal library about historic Menard. Jerry Rambo provided extensive
information on the history of FM 2092 during an interview conducted by Kay Hindes and Jennifer
McWilliams. Finally, Susan Smith Dorsey of the Texas General Land Office made recently scanned
historical maps available to us for the FM 2092 historical research.
Field crew consisted of Bennett Kimbell, Jenni Hatchett, and Cory Broehm. Doug Boyd of
Prewitt and Associates, Inc., served as the principal investigator, and Jennifer McWilliams was the
project archeologist. Karl Kibler served as the geomorphologist. Historian Céline Finney conducted
some of the research pertaining to the Menard Irrigation Company. Elaine Robbins edited this
report, and Sandra Hannum and Brian Wootan produced the figures.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

Although the FM 2092 transportation en­
hancement project is being undertaken by
TxDOT’s San Angelo District, the cultural re­
sources studies conducted by Prewitt and Asso­
ciates, Inc. (PAI), are directly supervised by the
Archeological Studies Program, Cultural Re­
sources Management Section of TxDOT’s Envi­
ronmental Affairs Division (TxDOT-ENV).
Because the road project involves no new right
of way, all of the field investigations were con­
ducted within the road right of way on property
owned by the State of Texas.
All of the work described in this report was
done in compliance with federal and state cul­
tural resources laws, specifically Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (16 USC
470 et seq.; 36 CFR 800) and the Antiquities
Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resources Code,
Title 9, Chapter 191; 13 TAC 26). Because the
work was done on property owned by the State
of Texas, the cultural resources studies were
done under the authority of Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 4192 issued by the Texas Historical
Commission (THC). All of the cultural resources
described in this report are evaluated relative
to the criteria for listing on the National Regis­
ter of Historic Places under the National His­
toric Preservation Act and for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark under the Antiq­
uities Code of Texas.

This report reviews historical and archeo­
logical investigations conducted for the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) in con­
junction with road improvements to FM 2092
in Menard County, Texas. The road project is
being undertaken by the San Angelo District
(CSJ No. 2008-01-091) and involves a 4.9-mile
segment of FM 2092 located east of the town of
Menard (Figure 1). TxDOT plans to restore, re­
surface, and widen the 4.9-mile-long segment
of FM 2092, beginning 0.4 miles east of U.S. 83
in Menard and extending eastward just past
Fivemile Crossing of the San Saba River. The
proposed transportation enhancement project
will include widening the two travel lanes and
adding shoulders. The proposed restoration will
consist of grinding up the existing pavement and
leaving it in place as the subbase and adding
new pavement as necessary to achieve the ap­
propriate width and depth. However, projectrelated construction impacts may occur
anywhere within TxDOT’s 100-ft-wide road
right of way. Excluding the 40-ft-wide existing
paved road, the archeological survey area for
this project is 16 ft wide on both the north and
south sides of the road, for a total right of way
width of 72 ft (22 m). The increase in pavement
will total 8 ft (2.4 m), for a total road-expansion
area of 4.75 acres. Project-related impacts will
be extensive within this area because several
feet of fill will be removed and replaced. Addi­
tional project-related impacts will occur
throughout the right of way as heavy machin­
ery is used for construction and reshaping of the
borrow ditches. The Area of Potential Effect
(APE) for this project is considered to be the
entire right of way.

WORK ACCOMPLISHED AND
REPORTING OF FINDINGS
The work reported in this volume was con­
ducted under two separate work authorizations
issued to PAI relating to the FM 2092 road im­
provement project. Testing of two sites along
FM 2092—41MN23 and 41MN55—is reported

Chapter 1: Introduction
in a later publication. PAI was issued the first
work authorization (WA No. 57536SA006,
March 31, 2006) to develop a scope of work and
outline the methodology for an intensive sur­
vey of the FM 2092 project area. This was com­
pleted and approved in May 2006. A second work
authorization (WA No. 57540SA006, May 17,
2006) was then issued to conduct an intensive
geoarcheological survey along the 4.9-mile-long
project area and conduct historical research on
certain historical sites. For this work, a final
scope of work was submitted to the Texas His­
torical Commission (THC) as part of the antiq­
uities permit application to conduct the
archeological investigations. THC issued Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 4192 on July 7, 2006, to
authorize an intensive survey with mechanical
trenching of the FM 2092 project area. The his­
torical research was completed, the archeologi­
cal survey was conducted from July 10 to 28,
2006, and a preliminary report of findings was
prepared in September 2006 (Boyd et al. 2006).
Following this work, TxDOT issued the third
work authorization (WA No. 57548SA006) to
conduct testing of one prehistoric site, 41MN55,
and data recovery excavations at Mission San
Sabá (41MN23). THC issued Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 4317 on November 13, 2006, to au­
thorize the site testing and data recovery. The
testing of 41MN55 took place from November 13
to 17, 2006, and the data recovery work at the
mission was conducted between November 27,
2006, and February 9, 2007.
Several different tasks were completed un­
der these work authorizations, but not all of the
work is reported here. This volume reports on
the following tasks:
•

Review of previously recorded prehistoric
and historic archeological sites in or near
the FM 2092 corridor.

•

Historical research on the Menard
Irrigation Company Canal, 41MN21.

•

Intensive historical documentation
research regarding known or possible
historic localities in or near FM 2092.

•

Geoarcheological assessment of the project
area.

•

Intensive archeological survey of FM 2092
(excluding the mission area).

•

National Register assessments of newly

recorded and previously recorded and
revisited sites, evaluation of project impacts,
and management recommendations.
The following tasks were also completed as
part of the FM 2092 project, but are reported
separately:
•

Transcription and translation of selected
Spanish documents, by Mariah Wade
(2007).

•

Review of previously published historical
data, unpublished research notes compiled
by historians Kay Hindes and Mark Wolf,
and other mission-related documents
(McWilliams et al. 2007).

•

Intensive archeological survey and data
recovery excavations at Mission San Sabá,
41MN23, including the 0.2-mile-long
“Mission Search Area” (McWilliams et al.
2007).

•

Archeological testing and National Register
assessment of a Toyah phase occupation at
41MN55 (McWilliams et al. 2007).

From a methodological standpoint, the 4.9­
mile-long project area was divided into two ar­
eas with different types of cultural resources. A
0.2-mile-long (350 m) stretch of the roadway in
the vicinity of Mission San Sabá (41MN23) was
defined as the “Mission Search Area.” The re­
maining 4.7 miles (7.6 km) of the roadway, in­
cluding ca. 1.8 miles east and ca. 2.9 miles west
of the Mission Search Area, was identified as
the FM 2092 survey area. Because of the na­
ture of the known and possible cultural re­
sources in these locations, different field
methods were employed to investigate these
areas.
The field investigations of the FM 2092
project area included a pedestrian survey of the
4.9-mile-long stretch of FM 2092, along with
excavation of 13 backhoe trenches, 1 gradall
trench, and 32 shovel tests inside the TxDOT
right of way. The work resulted in recording of 9
new sites and revisits to 10 previously recorded
sites. These are classified as 6 prehistoric sites,
4 historic sites, and 9 sites with both prehistoric
and historic components. The latter group in­
cludes the prehistoric and Spanish colonial de­
posits at Mission San Sabá.

Survey of FM 2092 from Menard to Fivemile Crossing
TxDOT and PAI held a postfield meeting on
August 15, 2006, to expedite the cultural re­
sources review process under federal and state
laws. All of the survey results were reviewed at
that meeting, and it was agreed that additional
archeological work at the mission site and one
prehistoric site (41MN55) would be appropri­
ate. Because of the construction schedule pro­
posed by the San Angelo District and the need
to expedite the federal and state review pro­
cesses, it was decided that PAI should prepare
and submit a preliminary report on the FM 2092
survey project. The analysis of cultural materi­
als and presentation of all data, as required in
a full report on the investigations, would be de­
layed so that a preliminary report could be
quickly prepared. The majority of this document

is taken from that preliminary report (Boyd
et al. 2006).
The remainder of this report summarizes
the work that was done for the FM 2092 survey
project, describes the cultural resources that
were found, and presents assessments of Na­
tional Register and State Archeological Land­
mark eligibility for the resources within the
FM 2092 right of way. This report documents
only the archeological survey of the 4.7-mile
FM 2092 project area, excluding the mission
area. Subsequent work was conducted at
41MN55 (testing of prehistoric remains) and at
41MN23 (data recovery at Mission San Sabá),
but these investigations will be reported sepa­
rately (interim reports are Boyd and Mehalchick
[2007] and McWilliams et al. [2007]).

improvements. These plans, which were final­
ized on May 6, 1955, helped us re-locate irriga­
tion laterals and historic building locations
adjacent to the roadway. Historic maps were also
consulted to try to pinpoint the route of the his­
toric roadway and to chart historically mapped
riverbed channels. Historic maps were collected
and/or copied from Mark Wolf’s research files,
the Texas General Land Office, and the Texas
State Library and Archives (both library and
Internet website files).
Two onsite meetings were held before the
archeological survey began. These meetings,
between PAI and TxDOT personnel and vari­
ous consultants, had two primary goals. The first
meeting was held to discuss historical resources
and logistics for the fieldwork. The other focused
on the geomorphology of the project area.
An onsite project review meeting was held
on June 7, 2006, to finalize the strategy for in­
vestigating the Spanish colonial remains and to
make logistical arrangements for the fieldwork.
Participants in this meeting were PAI personnel
(Boyd and McWilliams), personnel from the
TxDOT San Angelo District Office (Nancy Fisher
and Ann Maxwell, Environmental Affairs Divi­
sion (TxDOT-ENV), and Karen Threlkeld, Pub­
lic Information Officer) and the TxDOT Menard
Maintenance Office (Emiliano Gonzales), and
consultants Kay Hindes (historian), Mark Wolf
(historian), Dr. Grant Hall (archeologist, Texas
Tech University), and Dr. William Doolittle (ge­
ographer and irrigation system specialist, The
University of Texas at Austin).
The primary purpose of the meeting was to
discuss the potential for Spanish colonial, nine­
teenth-century archeological remains along
FM 2092 and to get input on the project area from
these knowledgeable researchers. During this

A variety of prefield tasks were undertaken.
One of the first tasks was to conduct archeo­
logical background research using the online
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and the site files
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin. This research revealed that
22 prehistoric and historic archeological sites
were documented in the San Saba River valley
between the presidio and Fivemile Crossing,
east of Menard (Figure 2; Table 1). Of these, 19
are located east of Menard in close proximity to
the FM 2092 project area. In Figure 2, it is no­
table that the TARL site plottings show most of
the sites as dots, and precise site boundaries are
not depicted. Other sources for site boundaries
have minor discrepancies (discussed below). The
sources include site plottings in individual site
files at TARL and site plottings on a 1990 sur­
vey map (provided courtesy of Shawn Carlson,
Star of the Republic Museum, and Patricia
Clabaugh, Anthropology Department, Texas
A&M University).
Modern and historic aerial photographs
were carefully examinedhs along with
Schlenker’s (1991) previous geomorphological
study of the San Saba River valley, done in con­
junction with Carlson’s (1991) Texas A&M Uni­
versity survey. Carlson’s study provided baseline
geomorphology interpretations for the San Saba
River near Menard.
Historic aerial photographs of the project
area were ordered from the Texas Natural Re­
sources Information System. The earliest avail­
able photographs for the area date to June 2,
1954, just one year before FM 2092 was straight­
ened and paved. TxDOT provided the 1954 en­
gineering schematic for the FM 2092 road

REVIEW OF HISTORICAL DATA
AND SPANISH COLONIAL
DOCUMENTS
The objective of the historical research was
to synthesize the existing historical information
pertaining to the Spanish colonial occupation
and subsequent Euroamerican settlement in the
San Saba River valley.

The second part of the historical research
involved the translation of primary Spanish
documents. At the inception of this project, PAI
contracted with Spanish colonial historian
Mariah Wade to conduct primary historical re­
search. Dr. Wade reviewed more than 150 Span­
ish documents from various central Texas
archives (primarily from the Old Spanish Mis­
sions Historical Research Collection, St. Flo­
rence Library Special Collections, Our Lady of
the Lake University, San Antonio, and the Cen­
ter for American History, The University of
Texas at Austin). Dr. Wade transcribed and
translated 10 selected documents. These docu­
ments provided more clues about the intensity
of Spanish activities at the mission and along
the road to the presidio. The results of this work
are being published as a separate publication
(Wade 2007) along with a comprehensive report
on the San Sabá Mission that includes results
of survey and data recovery work in the Mis­
sion Search Area (McWilliams et al. 2007). His­
torical research on the Menard irrigation canal
was also completed. The results of this research,
along with a historical overview of the Menard
Irrigation System, are presented in Chapter 3.

During the review of these sources, special
attention was paid to identifying all comments
that had relevance to possible historic resources
that are known to be, known to have been, or
might have been present along the FM 2092
corridor near Menard. All comments relevant
to the project area were compiled in a tabulated
format (Appendix A). This information was then
used to compile a shorter list of definite or pos­
sible site locations of historic resources. This
work identified 17 historic localities at precise
or fairly precise points in or near the project
area. Each of these localities was assigned a
number (1 through 17) and was plotted on a
modern aerial photograph (see Chapter 5). The
resulting map of historic localities was used
during the field survey to help guide the place­
ment of auger tests, recording of new sites, and
plotting new boundaries for previously recorded
sites. The historic localities include previously
recorded sites, a small cemetery, a Texas Rang­
ers camp, historic homes and businesses, old
roads, and structures. The latter locations were
checked against plottings of houses on the 1954
engineering schematic for FM 2092 (Texas High­
way Department 1954).

HISTORICAL RESEARCH AND OVERVIEW
OF THE MENARD IRRIGATION COMPANY

3

Jennifer K. McWilliams and Céline Finney

As part of the project to improve FM 2092
in Menard County, Texas, Prewitt and Associ­
ates, Inc. (PAI), was contracted to conduct his­
torical research and examine records pertaining
to the historic Menard Irrigation Company Ca­
nal. The canal was recorded as archeological site
41MN21 in 1991 (Carlson 1991:74–75) and
mapped on the USGS 7.5-minute Menard and
Chapman Draw quadrangles (see Figure 2).
The modern Menard Irrigation Company
system consists of a main canal approximately
10 miles long, beginning at a dam on the San
Saba River approximately 5 miles west of
Menard and ending where the canal joins the
river approximately 5 miles east of town. This
system was constructed beginning in 1874, but
portions of the main canal reportedly followed
the abandoned acequia built by the Span­
iarEEds living at Presidio San Sabá from 1757
to 1768 (Doolittle 1995; Mark Wolf, personal
communication 2006; Menard Irrigation Com­
pany 2006; Pierce 1946; Lehne 1982). Although
some local people have the opinion that the
Menard irrigation canal does not follow any sec­
tions of the old Spanish acequia, the historical
records leave little doubt that this is the case.
The nineteenth-century irrigation system is
still in use and was enlarged and improved at
various times. Lateral ditches have been con­
structed all along the main canal to channel
water into privately owned fields, but no infor­
mation has been found about the sequence of
lateral construction. It is likely that many lat­
erals were constructed, used, and abandoned
throughout the 131-year history of the irriga­
tion system at Menard.
This is not intended to be a comprehensive
history of the Menard Irrigation Company, nor
is it a thorough historic context. Rather, it is a

brief history of what is now the Menard Irriga­
tion Company, based on an examination of se­
lected historical records, and it provides some
baseline historic contextual information. To this
end, a historical timeline of events pertaining
to the irrigation canal was compiled (Table 2).
RESEARCH METHODS
Tasks associated with this segment of the
project included a file search and literature re­
view and preparation of a historical research
and overview document. In August 2006, an ar­
chitectural historian performed the file search
and literature review and wrote the overview
document. The literature review focused on
sources that document the history of the Menard
Irrigation Company, the main canal, and smaller
lateral canals. Information for this segment of
the project was gathered from Mark Wolf’s per­
sonal research files, the General Land Office
(GLO), selected articles in The Handbook of
Texas Online, published secondary sources, and
pertinent Internet sites. Records that were par­
ticularly informative include historical maps;
primary documentation from the GLO, includ­
ing a field inspection conducted in 1876; and a
brochure entitled “Menard Irrigation Company”
produced by the Menard Irrigation Company
(2006).
Personal historic research files were ob­
tained from Mark Wolf, a Mission San Sabá his­
torian from San Antonio, Texas. His files contain
copies from the Canal Contract No. 16 found at
the GLO entitled “Menard Irrigation Company”
and include an 1875 map of Vaughan’s (also
written Vaughn) Agricultural and Mechanical
Canal (Figure 4), various other maps of the irri­
gation system and San Saba River system, sur­

veys, deeds to the agricultural and mechanical
district company, court minutes, a field inspec­
tion and notes, an index to deed records, and
notes from a phone interview with Chet Haley,
former president of the Menard Irrigation Com­
pany. The majority of items in Mr. Wolf’s files
are copies of original records dating from ca.
1875 to ca. 1886.
A review of Menard Irrigation Company
records at the GLO was conducted on August 6,
2006, but this work revealed no new data other
than that previously compiled by Mark Wolf (in
the Canal Contract No. 16 file, Menard Irriga­
tion Company). Céline Finney, architectural his­
torian for PAI, made copies of two historic maps
of the irrigation district. With the help of a GLO
archivist, Finney determined that no further
information pertaining to the Menard Irrigation
Company existed at the GLO. In addition, no
information pertaining to Gus Noyes, the man
who purchased the irrigation canal from W. J.
Vaughan in the 1880s, was on file. The archivist
commented that 11 certificates were issued but
never delivered to the GLO, and it is speculated
that many of the records that document the early
history of the irrigation system were originally
in the possession of the Menard Irrigation Com­
pany but were thrown out when the company’s
former president, Chet Haley, passed away in
2004 (Kniffen 2006). At present, no new infor­
mation pertaining to the irrigation company and

any improvements or additions to the irrigation
system after 1880 has been located. Local infor­
mants Katherine Kniffen (current officer) and
Jake Landers (on the current board of directors)
were consulted to fill in gaps in the historic
record.
“THE LIFE-BLOOD OF
AGRICULTURE” OF THE
SAN SABA VALLEY
William J. Vaughan came to Menard County
in 1866 (Lehne 1982). Realizing the potential a
canal held for irrigating fields, as well as attract­
ing settlers, he decided to channel the waters of
the San Saba River and persuaded James W.
Comstock and William J. Tipton to join the ven­
ture (Lehne 1982). A brochure published by the
Menard Irrigation Company states that
Vaughan, Comstock, and Tipton chartered the
Vaughan Ditch Agricultural and Mechanical
Company in 1870, and the deed for this purchase
was filed on December 2, 1871 (Menard Irriga­
tion Company 2006). However, most sources
state that the company was chartered on
July 24, 1874, to channel water from the San
Saba River “commencing five miles above the
town of Menardville and to extend 20 miles be­
low the town” for the purposes of agricultural
irrigation, various mill operations, and mechani­
cal uses (Menard Irrigation Company 2006;

Chapter 3: Overview of the Menard Irrigation Company
Pierce 1946:21). Again, there is some confusion
in the records because a second charter was then
issued to Charles Shriner, J. A. Conway, L. L.
Russell, L. M. Chastain, J. W Ellis, and J. L.
Noguess at an unknown date (Menard Irriga­
tion Company 2006). However, no records of
these names appear in the GLO files.
Clearly, the original plan of the canal was
approximately 15 miles longer than the modernday canal, and the original proposed canal was
intended to extend to the Menard-Mason county
line (see Figure 4). Vaughan’s original canal only
went 2 miles east of town (Pierce 1946). The li­
cense to operate the irrigation canal was $20
per year (Menard Irrigation Company 2006).
Capitol stock in the company was fixed at
$50,000, and 100 shares were issued (Pierce
1946:21; Noguess 1946:23).
Construction of the dam and ditch began in
1874. Vaughan’s crew used picks, shovels, and
eventually added a scraper or slip pulled by a
team (Lehne 1982; Noguess 1946). However,
there were problems with the initial layout of
the ditch. Apparently, Vaughan hired a less than
reliable surveyor (records do not indicate the
name of the original surveyor), and approxi­
mately 1 mile of excavated ditch line was not
effective (Noguess 1946:22; Lehne 1982:18). This
surveyor was replaced by John F. Dexter
(Noguess 1946:22), who surveyed the ditch route
and compiled a detailed map and notes (Dexter
1875a; 1875b; Figure 5). Henry C. King, a field
inspector, explained that the ditch was “more
costly than usual, owing to engineering difficul­
ties” (1876:n.p.).
Additional difficulties included at least one
court case involving William Graham, a land­
owner west of Menard, who did not approve of
the “destruction” crossing his land (Noguess
1946; Lehne 1982; Menard County Court
Records, June 3, 1874). Eventually, the canal
was put through his land, but he got his revenge
when “ditch hands” cut Graham’s fence. Graham
charged Vaughan $11 for repairs to his fence
(Noguess 1946:23).
Captain Dan Roberts, who oversaw the
Texas Rangers in Menard from 1875 to 1878 and
later at Fort McKavett in 1878, describes the
evolution of government subsidies to irrigation
projects and the Rangers’ role in the irrigation
ditch:

came into the Union of the
States, she reserved all her
public
domain,
and
appropriated it to the
upbuilding of the state, in
public institutions and school
funds. And “Uncle Sam” was not
more liberal in giving the
people homes. I think it was the
Fourteenth Legislature [13
January 1874 to 15 March
1875] that offered land subsidy,
to encourage irrigation,
specifying the dimensions of a
ditch to carry the water, say
six feet wide, at the bottom of
the ditch, and twelve feet wide,
from cut to cut across the top,
and four feet deep, on level
ground. For this class of ditch,
the state offered three sections
of land to the mile of ditch, not
otherwise appropriated, to the
makers of that grade of ditches.
The state not reserving any
rental, or any further claim on
the enterprise. Under this
covenant, between the state
and the citizen we had the
pleasure of seeing the first ditch
made, and stood guard for the
workers in their happy vocation
[Roberts 1987:85].
On July 19, 1876, a field inspection was con­
ducted and recorded by King (transcribed by
Mark Wolf in the Wolf Research Files). King
served as the “Commissioner of Canals and
Ditches West of the Colorado River” under Gov­
ernor Richard Coke (to whom the field inspec­
tion was addressed) and under Governor R. B.
Hubbard (Rouse 2001).
In his report, King (1876:n.p.) describes the
first mile of the ditch as being
…constructed on the line of a
ditch made prior to the Act of
the 10th March, 1875, entitled
“An Act to encourage the
construction of canals and
ditches for navigation and
irrigation”…that part of the
ditch…is 1458…varas in

the interior towns, they had
been compelled to leave these
rocks until the powder arrived.
They stated that they expected
to take these pieces of rock the
following week after the
inspection. The rocks do not
entirely obstruct the flow of
water, and the ditch may be
used without removing them.
The general character of the
work, however, and it’s
prospective usefulness seem to
guaranty the removal of these
obstructions.

It is likely that this mention of “the old ditch”
refers to the Spanish acequia.
At the time of the 1876 initial inspection,
the ditch was 4 miles long. The ditch appears to
have passed the inspection with the exception
of a rock obstruction found in the last eighth of
the final (forth) mile of the ditch. King
(1876:n.p.) reported:
The company stated to me that

ished condition is not approved” (Field Inspec­
tion 1876:n.p., Wolf Research Files). On Octo­
ber 10, 1876, Vaughan appointed John H. Dexter
[sic] (probably the same as surveyor John “F”
Dexter) to be the agent to the General Land
Office (GLO documents, Wolf Research Files). A
few months later, King advised the Governor
that the rock had been removed, and the ditch
finally passed inspection on February 2, 1877.
On March 5, 1877, the company received $5,000
in bonds for the canal for a 10-year period (Field
Inspection 1876, Wolf Research Files).

In 1886, engineer Gus Noyes moved from
Maine to settle in Menard. Seeing the possibili­
ties of irrigation in the area, he quickly obtained
56 of the 100 available shares and interested
others to join him in continuing the development
of the canal and irrigation system. He built a
dam across the river in about 1890. On August 4,
1904, Noyes purchased the company from J. W.
Vaughan, the son of William J. Vaughan. The
elder Vaughn died in 1891, having never used
water from the canal to irrigate his land, al­
though he reportedly had “sunk” $12,000 into
its construction (Noguess 1946:23). His widow
17

Survey of FM 2092 from Menard to Fivemile Crossing
bought water from Noyes at the going rate of $2
per inch per acre for 10 years. Mrs. Whittie
Vaughn Noguess, the daughter of William J.
Vaughn, stated that Noyes also dug the canal
deeper and “changed the course of the old char­
tered line, about 200 yards east of the west line
of the old Arnet Tipton survey of land and made
what he called a surface ditch” (Noguess
1946:23). This change in the route avoided
Vaughan’s land, preventing him from using the
water. Noguess’s note suggests that Tipton sur­
veyed some portion of the early line or that
Noyes had access to the Tipton survey for his
new line.
Noyes employed approximately 100 work­
ers, and within two years the canal totaled
8 miles through the valley. These workers prob­
ably lived in the community of Sunnyside, ca.
4 miles east of Menard on FM 2092. In 1991,
Carlson recorded three historic sites (41MN5,
41MN9, and 41MN10), including the Noyes
homesite, remains of other homesites, a cotton
gin, a historic artifact scatter, and a dump. How­
ever, additional information suggests that these
sites represent a community or tent camp that
was the home to workmen for Noyes’s farm and
cotton gin (Smyrl 2001) as well as the “ditch
hands.” More information on Sunnyside is pro­
vided in Chapter 5.
In 1905, Noyes formed the Menard Irriga­
tion Company, and the system irrigated about
2,000 acres in the San Saba River valley. Noyes
reportedly profited $20,000 per year from his
irrigation “projects” (Menard Irrigation Com­
pany 2006), suggesting that he may have had
other endeavors besides the one at Menard.
Once a steady supply of water was established,
the valley was able to produce cotton, corn, oats,
potatoes, melons and “garden truck” produce
(Noguess 1946:25). The normal ditch flow in
1904 was 17.5 cubic feet per second (Menard
Irrigation Company 2006).
Vaughan died on December 28, 1891, hav­
ing “sunk” $12,000 into the endeavor (Noguess
1946). Vaughan never irrigated his land with
the water from the canal. His widow bought
water from Noyes at the going rate of $2 per
inch per acre for 10 years (Noguess 1946). After
30 successful years operating the irrigation sys­
tem, Noyes sold his interest in the canal (Pierce
1946:21) in about 1935.
Throughout the twentieth century, the main
canal and subsequent lateral ditches irrigated

fields along both sides of what is now FM 2092.
The canal remains in use today and is operated
by the Menard Irrigation Company in Menard.
Currently 20 shareholders participate in the
irrigation canal, and dues increased from $100
to $150 in 2003. Each shareholder is allotted
4½ hours of water, which runs on a 17-day cycle
(Menard Irrigation Company 2006). A “sag-cul­
vert” was installed in 1975 to replace the old
flume at Las Mores Creek, and $90,000 was
spent on updates between 2000 and 2003
(Menard Irrigation Company 2006). The portion
of the historic canal that runs through town is
locally known as “The Ditch,” and the scenic
“Ditch walk” has become a tourist attraction for
the community of Menard (Menard Irrigation
Company 2006).
EARLY HISTORY OF THE
MENARD IRRIGATION CANAL
When construction of the original system
began, some sections of the main canal report­
edly followed the abandoned acequias built by
the Spaniards living at Presidio San Saba from
1757 to 1768 (Doolittle 1995; Mark Wolf, per­
sonal communication 2006; Haley 1995; Pierce
1946; Lehne 1982). Pierce (1946:20) supports the
theory in his article entitled “Spaniards Built
First Irrigation Ditch.” But he also states that
the original functions of the acequia were: (1) to
“provide some means of transporting rock across
the stream, to be used in building rock walls of
the presidio and compound”; and (2) to irrigate
the fields using lateral ditches. Pierce goes on
to explain that the Spanish built rafts to float
the rock across the river. However, this is not
likely the case; they probably built the acequias
for the sole purpose of irrigation.
Four pieces of evidence support the theory
that the Menard Irrigation Canal follows the
route of the Spanish acequia: (1) Dexter’s 1875
field notes mention “Spanish Ditch”; (2) Dexter’s
1875 survey map and the USGS map line up
with where the Spanish ditch are thought to
converge; (3) Callan’s 1901 map mentions the
old irrigation system; (4) Chet Haley said that
the “present ditch did make use of Spanish
acequia.”
Dexter’s field notes and survey map (1875a;
1875b) confirm that the irrigation canal followed
the Spanish acequia for some distance (see Fig­
ure 5). Starting at Cogden Creek (also called

Survey of FM 2092 from Menard to Fivemile Crossing
Coghlan in some sources), ca. 4 miles west of
town, Dexter measured in 36-vara-lengths
(100 ft or 1 chain), taking measurements from
survey corners. For a distance of 1,714 ft, he
wrote “Mountain - - Side,” indicating that the
canal followed around the north side of the bluffs
on the west side of Menard. Then at 4,385 ft, he
wrote, “Point Mountain/Old Spanish Ditch.” The
point at which the canal intersected the “Old
Spanish Ditch” is about half a mile southwest
of the Presidio San Sabá. Apparently, the canal
followed the Spanish acequia for an unknown
distance but at least 806.4 ft.
Judge J. J. Callan provided many clues to
the route and history of the canal in a 1901 map
he enclosed in a letter regarding inquiries about
the Mission San Sabá (Figure 6). In the map,
Callan depicts the San Saba River valley and
the canal running from the “new dam” (prob­
ably Noyes’s 1890 dam), running through
Menard and ending east of town near the
confluence of Scalp Creek, just east of the mis­
sion site. Callan annotated the map with the
following statement: “The present irrigation
system is very nearly the same as 150 or 160
years ago. The same ditch carrying the water
into Menardville valley 150 years ago around
the point of mountain, is the one now used.”
Callan’s map clearly shows the irrigation canal
converging with a canal that flows from the “old
dam” just west of “Fort San Saba”—interpreted
as the Spanish acequia—at the point along the
bluffs just west of the town of Menard. He shows
a second canal coming off the main canal and
running south and east through the town of
Menard, and explains in his annotation that this
area was “cultivated 150 years ago.” Continu­
ing eastward, the map shows the canal heading
east out of Menard and converging with a third
canal that appears to correspond with the loca­
tion of Harris Hollow on modern topographical
maps. Finally, the canal ends near the site of
Mission San Sabá with the words “Presidio
Smelter.” This suggests that Callan (and possi­

bly his contemporaries) interpreted the mission
site as a smelter for the presidio, perhaps be­
cause they observed large amounts of burned
daub and metal artifacts there.
Mark Wolf interviewed Chet Haley, the
former Menard Irrigation Canal president, in
1995. Haley, who was 80 years old at the time,
reported that at one time the ditch ran through
town north of San Saba Street. He confirmed
three facts: (1) that the “ditch did make use of
[the] Spanish acequia”; (2) that at one time, the
ditch flowed below Noyes’s cotton gin (then on
the McDaniels Place) and crossed the river on
the east side; and (3) that two to three gristmills
and a cotton mill once operated along the ditch,
but the “State came through and forbid [the]
generation of power” from the irrigation canal
(Haley 1995). Haley’s records were lost after his
death and are thought to be the 11 boxes for
which space was reserved at the General Land
Office.
FIELD DOCUMENTATION OF
THE MENARD IRRIGATION
SYSTEM COMPONENTS
During the FM 2092 archeological survey by
PAI in July 2006, five segments of the irriga­
tion system were photodocumented where they
pass beneath FM 2092. These segments include
one road crossing of the main canal, which is
mapped on the USGS 7.5-minute Menard and
Chapman Draw quadrangles, and four road
crossings of smaller laterals. During the field
survey, black-and-white and digital color pho­
tographs were taken of each ditch location that
was within or near the FM 2092 right of way.
This work was not intended as a comprehen­
sive historic resources reconnaissance, and it
does not provide all necessary information to
support a full evaluation of the irrigation sys­
tem. However, the photographs do document the
sections of the system that are within the stateowned right of way (see Chapter 5).

ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF FM 2092
FROM MENARD TO FIVEMILE CROSSING

Jennifer K. McWilliams and Douglas K. Boyd

The backhoe and gradall were only used in
areas delineated for mechanical trenching
where buried utilities had been precisely
marked (see Figure 3). A Bobcat equipped with
a 12-inch-diameter auger was used to dig tests
in the bottoms of the borrow ditches in lieu of
shovel tests. Both auger tests and trenches were
plotted on aerial photographs as they were dug,
and UTM coordinate locations were also re­
corded using a handheld Garmin GPS LX. The
survey and mechanical testing were followed by
shovel testing in selected areas.
In general, a no-collection policy was used
for the archeological survey of the FM 2092
project corridor, but selected diagnostic speci­
mens were surface collected from one site
(41MN55). Flakes found in auger and shovel
tests were recorded in the field but not collected.
Survey and subsurface testing within the
FM 2092 right of way included examination of
many unrecorded historic locations, previously
recorded sites, and areas near previously re­
corded sites. This work also included subsurface

The investigation of 4.7 miles of FM 2092
(excluding the ca. 400-m-long Mission Search
Area) focused on re-locating and reevaluating
previously recorded sites and identifying new
sites within the road right of way. Work began
with a pedestrian survey, mechanical augering,
and backhoe trenching. A gradall was also used
in one area. This was followed by shovel testing
in selected areas. Excavations to expose and
sample the subsurface deposits along the 4.7­
mile-long stretch of FM 2092 included 13 back­
hoe trenches, 1 gradall trench, 50 auger tests,
and 26 shovel tests.
Pedestrian survey was conducted by walk­
ing the road right of way, both north and south
of the road, and visually inspecting all areas
where ground exposures were good. Although
the edges of the roadway had been recently
mowed, most of the right of way was covered in
dense grasses so that the survey had to rely on
subsurface testing. Prehistoric sites were dis­
covered by the presence of surface artifacts in
some areas that had minimal vegetation cover.

testing of site and nonsite areas using backhoe
trenching, gradall trenching, auger testing, and
shovel testing (Tables 3 and 4).
Table 5 summarizes all of the recorded sites
in and near the FM 2092 project area, and their
locations are shown in Figure 7. During the sur­
vey, eight of the previously recorded sites were
found to be outside the project area and between
100 m and 700 m away from the road. The right
of way was also inspected for 10 previously re­
corded sites, and archeological remains were
found associated with 5 of these. The survey also
discovered and documented 9 new sites. Of the
19 sites known to be adjacent to or extend into
the FM 2092 right of way, 4 are historic, 6 are
prehistoric, and 9 have both historic and pre­
historic components.

large rainfall events.There are many stock ponds
along the hollow, and numerous electrical pumps
line the bottom. Local informants say that the
water table in Harris Hollow is only 15 ft deep.
Backhoe Trench 1 was dug in the bottom of Har­
ris Hollow, and Trenches 2 and 3 were dug on
the west and east sides of the swale, respectively.
Trench 1 revealed a dense zone of channel grav­
els (most fist-sized and smaller) at 158 cm be­
low surface, overlain by fine-grained alluvium.
No gravels were found in the other trenches, but
Trench 1 stratigraphy clearly indicates that
Harris Hollow was once a large stream, presum­
ably a former channel of the San Saba River.
The stratigraphic profile of Backhoe Trench 1
(see Appendix B), examined by geomorphologist
Karl Kibler, indicates that this channel has been
abandoned for some time. Two soil humate
samples were taken on the overlying clayey de­
posits, and they were submitted to Beta Ana­
lytical for radiocarbon dating. The resulting
assays and interpretations are reported in a
subsequent publication (McWilliams et al. 2007).

SUMMARY OF BACKHOE
TRENCHING
Before fieldwork, six investigation areas
were determined to need mechanical trenching,
and four areas were slated for backhoe trenches
(see Figure 3). Backhoe excavations began at
Harris Hollow, near the western end of the
project area, and moved eastward through the
project area. Trenches were 0.8 m wide, ranged
from 6 to 12 m long, and generally reached
depths of 1.5 to 2 m. Appendix B presents de­
scriptions of geologic profiles for selected
trenches.
Backhoe Trenches 1–3 were placed within
and on either side of the swale at Harris Hol­
low. Backhoe Trenches 4–6 were placed in the
vicinity of an unnamed swale about 1 km west
of Fivemile Crossing. Backhoe Trenches 7–10
were placed in the Holocene alluvial terrace ca.
200–400 m west of Fivemile Crossing. Backhoe
Trench 11 was placed on a higher Pleistocene
surface east of the San Saba River. Finally, Back­
hoe Trenches 12 and 13 were placed near the
eastern end of the Mission Search Area, about
150–250 m east of the location of Mission San
Sabá. No prehistoric or historic remains were
found in any of the trenches, although Backhoe
Trenches 5 and 6 were dug in prehistoric sites
as indicated by surface evidence (see Chapter 5
for 41MN54 and 41MN53).
Harris Hollow is a prominent swale that
runs from west to east down the San Saba River
valley. Because of the agricultural landscaping,
this broad swale holds running water during

SUMMARY OF GRADALL
TRENCHING
Nineteen gradall trenches were excavated in
the Mission San Sabá Search Area, but these are
discussed in a subsequent publication
(McWilliams et al. 2007). The gradall was used
in only one other location along FM 2092, in the
vicinity of the Tull Smith gravesite (see Historic
Localities 1–4 in Chapter 5). Because there was
one known and several possible historic graves
located 25 m north of the road, and they were in­
side a tree motte that comes within 10 m of the
road, the possibility of additional graves associ­
ated with the small cemetery or unmarked graves
was high. A mechanical grave search was con­
ducted. A 15-m-long gradall trench was dug in
the borrow ditch north of FM 2092, directly south
of the tree motte where the graves are located.
The trench could not be excavated closer to the
north right-of-way fence because of a buried util­
ity line, and it could not be excavated closer to
the road because of the thickness of the artificial
fill forming the road base. The trench was exca­
vated to a depth of 40–50 cm, and homogenous
intact clayey sediment was encountered. At this
depth, any grave shafts would have been visible,
but none were found. The grave locations were
not recorded as a historic site because they

were outside the project area and did not ex­
tend into the FM 2092 right of way.
One backhoe trench was excavated on pri­
vate property, with permission from the land­
owners, Monte and Suzie Lyckman. This trench
was dug across a section of abandoned irriga­
tion lateral ditch not far from the Mission San
Sabá site to determine if the historic irrigation
lateral might follow an old Spanish acequia near
the mission. The evidence suggested that this
was not the case. The details of this investiga­
tion are presented in a separate report on ar­
cheological investigations at Mission San Sabá

to the east throughout the remainder of the
project area. Auger tests were numbered con­
secutively throughout the project area. Auger
tests were generally spaced out about 100 m
apart. However, when an auger test yielded ar­
tifacts, additional auger tests or shovel tests
would be dug nearby to provide a better sample
of the materials.
Two problems were encountered with the
unmodified debitage found in auger testing. One
was determining the depths that flakes origi­
nated from, and the other was determining
whether or not they were really flakes. Attempts
to determine the depth where these artifacts
originated proved difficult in most cases. Auger
test profiles commonly exhibited an upper ca.
20 cm of artificial gravelly road fill, followed by
pale brown to dark brown loam, silty loam, or
clay loam with small to medium gravels inter­
mixed. At times, larger gravels were found at
deeper depths. As the auger tests were dug, it
was usually difficult to tell where any particu­
lar flake might have been originally. It is no­
table that the 1954 FM 2092 engineering
schematic (Texas Highway Department 1954)
shows at least five quarries near the road-im­
provement project that were used to collect
gravel for fill base. Thus, it is clear that much of
the road base added for FM 2092 was from lo­
cal gravel sources, and the materials would be
indistinguishable from those in natural grav­
els.
Because of the gravelly nature of the soils
and the presence of artificial gravels, chert nod­
ules and broken pieces of chert were common.
It appears likely that several different processes
introduced pseudo artifacts. Plowing of the ag­
ricultural fields, including areas now within the
road right of way, undoubtedly broke some of
the natural chert nodules and created “artifacts.”
Next, gravelly road base was introduced when
the county road was built and maintained, and
again when FM 2092 was built in the 1950s.
During initial construction and subsequent
maintenance episodes, heavy machinery cer­
tainly broke chert nodules and created “road
artifacts.” Finally, “auger artifacts” were created
during this archeological project when the me­
chanical auger hit chert nodules, especially as
it was grinding through dense layers of artifi­
cial gravels. While it was often possible to iden­
tify these pseudo artifacts, it was not obvious in
some cases. While some auger tests produced

SUMMARY OF AUGER TESTING
Fifty auger tests were excavated with a Bob­
cat equipped with a 16-inch-diameter auger at­
tachment (see Appendix C). Each test was
approximately 40 cm in diameter, and they were
dug to depths ranging from 28 to 114 cm. Auger
testing was stopped at a depth where dense
gravels or bedrock was encountered or at a depth
of approximately 100 cm. Most were dug to 70
to 100 cm below surface. In order to avoid the
buried utility lines that were within 3 to 4 m of
the right-of-way fences, auger tests had to be
dug in the half of the right of way closest to the
paved road. This meant that they were either
in the middle of the borrow ditch (if there was
one) or just upslope toward the road. Because
there was often a layer of gravelly artificial fill
along the roadway, dense gravels sometimes
prevented the auger from digging deep enough
to sample the underlying deposits.
Auger tests were dug as a single unit be­
cause separation by levels was not possible.
Matrix was piled off to one side of the auger hole
and screened through a 1/4-inch hardware mesh
screen. Stratigraphic observations were made
while the auger excavation was being conducted.
Each auger test was plotted on an aerial photo­
graph, stratigraphic observations were noted,
and recovery of artifacts was recorded on an
Auger Test Record Form. Unmodified flakes
were the only artifacts observed in auger tests,
and since no diagnostic artifacts were found,
nothing was collected.
Auger testing began immediately west of
Harris Hollow (see Figure 3) and moved west­
ward. When this area was completed, auger test­
ing continued east of Harris Hollow and moved
29

Survey of FM 2092 from Menard to Fivemile Crossing
flakes that were unmistakably of prehistoric
origin, others produced flakes of uncertain ori­
gin. This was an issue in some of the shovel tests
as well (see below), but the better vertical con­
trol enabled more confidence in determining the
origins of the flakes. However, one could not as­
sume that a flake was a prehistoric artifact sim­
ply because it was found in the underlying clay
deposits, because it was common to find isolated
nodules and broken cobbles deep in drying
cracks in the clayey alluvium. Because of this
uncertainty, the archeologists often labeled the
auger test records with qualifiers such as “pos­
sible” and “probable” when recording lithic
debitage counts. Airing on the conservative side,
auger tests were only considered to be positive
if an unmistakable flake was present or if mul­
tiple flakes were found.
Of the 50 auger tests excavated, 31 were
placed near previously recorded sites or in ar­
eas where new sites were discovered. These au­
ger tests are discussed in Chapter 5. The
remaining 19 auger tests were excavated in ar­
eas where no sites were previously known. They
produced no archeological remains. The off-site
auger tests are briefly described below.
Auger Tests 5 and 6 were placed 15 m and
150 m west of the Historic Graves Search Area
(see Figure 3), and Auger Tests 7 and 8 were
placed 46 m and 180 m east of the grave area.
These reached depths ranging from 70 to 93 cm
below surface and exposed road gravels over
grayish brown silty loam. Auger Tests 10–12
were placed between 41MN57 and 41MN58 at
the western end of the project area (see Figure
3). Auger Test 10 reached 40 cm and exposed
pale pinkish brown silty loam with gravels. Au­
ger Tests 11 and 12 reached 100 and 90 cm be­
low surface and exposed brown silty clay loam
with gravels.
Auger Tests 15–17 were dug north of a
whitewashed stone well house located just out­
side of the right of way. These were placed to
test for historic materials associated with a pos­
sible historic farmstead that may have extended
into the right of way. A 1-m roadcut here trun­
cated the site within the right of way. These tests
reached 65–90 cm and exposed pale pinkish
brown to light brown silty loam with dense
gravel well below surface deposits. Two to three
possible flakes were recovered from each of these
auger tests, but they are not considered to be

prehistoric due to the depths and contexts where
they were found. They are most likely flakes
brought in with road fill or created through
gravel damage by road maintenance or auger
testing.
Auger Tests 38–46 were dug in the south­
ern right of way near the eastern end of the
project area. These reached 61–87 cm, with the
exception of Auger Test 41, which only reached
30 cm. These exposed gravelly brown silty loam.
Auger Test 40 recovered an isolated core. Auger
Test 42 recovered one sherd of whiteware with
blue glaze and three iron fragments (probably
associated with the irrigation ditch crossing).
Auger Test 43 recovered one possible flake, one
mussel shell fragment, and one aqua bottleneck
fragment. Auger Tests 44, 45, and 46 recovered
2 possible flakes each. This area was surveyed
intensively, but no surface artifacts were ob­
served, other than light scatters of modern and
recent historic debris, probably associated with
highway-related trash. Because no distinct con­
centration of materials could be defined, no site
was recorded here. It is likely that these light
surface scatters of lithics are the result of road
maintenance, plowing, and gravel quarrying
over the years and are not prehistoric deposits.
SUMMARY OF SHOVEL TESTING
Thirty-two shovel tests were excavated dur­
ing the survey phase of fieldwork along
FM 2092. All shovel tests excavated during the
survey were placed on either previously recorded
or newly recorded sites (see Appendix C). Shovel
tests were 30 cm in diameter and were dug in
20-cm levels. Matrix was screened through 1/4­
inch hardware mesh. Soil stratigraphy and ar­
tifacts were recorded on a Shovel Test Record
Form. Unmodified flakes and one core were the
only definite artifacts found in shovel tests, and
since no diagnostic artifacts were recovered,
nothing was collected. Most shovel tests were
placed in the vicinity of positive auger tests
where definite or probable prehistoric artifacts
were recovered. The shovel tests were used to
establish the vertical distribution of historic and
prehistoric artifacts, and in some cases to con­
firm that flakes found in the auger tests were
actually prehistoric artifacts. The shovel tests
also helped establish the site boundaries for
previously recorded and newly recorded sites.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES AND HISTORIC LOCALITIES
RECORDED ALONG FM 2092

Jennifer K. McWilliams

Prior to this survey, 22 archeological sites
were recorded in the general vicinity of the
project area, 19 of which fall along this segment
of FM 2092 east of Menard (see Table 1; Fig­
ure 3). These include six prehistoric sites, one
Spanish colonial site (41MN23, Mission San
Sabá), three nineteenth-century historic sites,
eight that contain both nineteenth-century and
prehistoric components, and one that contains
both nineteenth-century and probable Spanish
colonial components (41MN21, irrigation canal).
The site of Presidio San Sabá is 41MN1, and its
location has long been known. All of the other
sites were recorded after 1990.
Texas A&M University conducted an archeo­
logical survey of a portion of the San Saba River
valley around Menard in 1990, and the results
of this study are reported by Carlson (1991). This
survey was conducted primarily to search for
the archeological remains of Mission San Sabá.
Although they were able to narrow down the
search area for the missing mission, they did
not find the site. The survey did, however, record
18 archeological sites (41MN5 through 41MN22)
scattered across the San Saba River valley, pri­
marily east of Menard.
In conjunction with the 1990 Texas A&M
survey, Schlenker (1991) conducted a prelimi­
nary geoarcheological study of a 5-mile-long
section the San Saba River valley east of
Menard. This study documented several land­
forms in the valley (including an alluvial fan,
old and young alluvial terraces, active flood­
plain, and active channel) and identified some
old river channel locations based on subsurface
exposures (see Schlenker 1991:Figures 10–15).
Schlenker (1991:Table 1) also documented many
high-velocity flood events from 1899 to 1977. In
addition, historian Martha Doty Freeman

(1991:Figure 24) located a 1913 county surveyor
map showing that a portion of the San Saba
River channel (in the eastern end of the FM 2092
project area) was in a different location than it
is today. Collectively, these studies indicate that
the San Saba River was a dynamic river system
and that the potential for well-preserved bur­
ied prehistoric or historic deposits in different
alluvial settings is very high.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES
IN THE FM 2092 RIGHT OF WAY
Ten previously recorded archeological sites
are adjacent to or within TxDOT right of way
along FM 2092 (see Table 1). These sites are
described below, including setting, previous
work, summary of the current investigations,
observed cultural materials, horizontal and ver­
tical extent of cultural deposits, and assessment
of site type and research potential. All 10 of the
previously recorded sites are discussed below,
even if no cultural remains were found within
the TxDOT right of way during this survey.
41MN5, Sunnyside Community
(see also 41MN10)
Originally recorded by Carlson in 1991,
41MN5 consisted of three distinct historic ar­
tifact scatters, remnants of a cotton gin, and a
prehistoric lithic scatter that produced Early
Archaic and Late Prehistoric diagnostics
(1991:54). At that time, the historic component
was interpreted as a farmstead associated with
the cotton gin. Carlson (1991:54) states, “The
scatter nearest State Highway 2092 had the
greatest density and no doubt represents the
house site while the other two [scatters] may
31

Survey of FM 2092 from Menard to Fivemile Crossing
have been outbuildings.” Artifacts observed
were indicative of household and farm-related
activities.
The lithic scatter was observed as a concen­
tration on a slight mound in the center of the
field and included cores, blades, gravers, re­
touched flakes, rough bifaces, tested and un­
tested chert cobbles, burned limestone, and at
least four keeled end scrapers. A piece of pos­
sible daub was also observed. The presence of
possible daub at this site close to the mission is
interesting. Although daub could certainly be
from a prehistoric or historic Indian occupation,
daub was the most common material found in
the cultural deposits at Mission San Sabá
(Hindes et al. 1995:55–61), only 0.7 km to the
west.
Current historical research revealed that
the community of Sunnyside was located here
in the 1880s. The community consisted of a cot­
ton gin, a store, and a school (Smyrl 2001), al­
though homes or a tent camp was probably also
present. The settlement was established for
workers of the Gus Noyes farm (Smyrl 2001).
Since Noyes came to Menard in 1886 (Pierce
1946:21) and employed approximately 100 men
to extend the irrigation canal in the 1890s
(Menard Irrigation Company 2006), it is pos­
sible that this settlement may have housed the
workers.
Jerry Rambo (personal communication
2006) reported that his father attended school
in Sunnyside (interpreted to possibly be around
the 1920s). The community does not appear on
the 1936 or 1958 Menard County Highway maps
(Texas Highway Department 1936, 1958), but
is further described in the context of the irriga­
tion canal (see Chapter 3).
Carlson’s hand-drawn map found in the
TARL site files shows the site extending ca.
150 m along the northern FM 2092 right of way,
roughly between Rambo Lane and the crossing
of the irrigation canal near the east-central por­
tion of the project area. Historic artifacts were
found on the southern side of the right of way in
Auger Test 42 but were associated with the irri­
gation ditch crossing. Disturbances within the
right of way may have removed artifacts along
FM 2092. Although no artifacts were observed
within the right of way along this portion of
FM 2092, a TexSite archeological site revisit
form was filed at TARL explaining the probable
history of the site.

41MN9
Carlson recorded 41MN9, the Gus Noyes
farmstead, in 1991. The site consists of an origi­
nal structure atop a limestone-lined basement
thought to be constructed in the 1880s or 1890s,
a spring-fed tank, irrigated fields, and a prehis­
toric lithic scatter. The home has been modified
significantly. Carlson excavated six shovel tests
and recovered nondiagnostic historic artifacts
that appeared to be consistent with a late-nine­
teenth-century occupation. A light scatter of
prehistoric artifacts suggests a few short Na­
tive American occupations.
On Carlson’s hand-drawn map found in the
TARL site file, the site spans ca. 175 m along
FM 2092. No cultural materials were observed
along the FM 2092 right of way. Because no cul­
tural materials were found, no further work was
conducted at this site, and no site revisit form
was completed.
41MN10, Sunnyside Community
(see also 41MN5)
Carlson also recorded 41MN10, a historic
farmstead, in 1991. Household and architectural
artifacts were observed as well as a low rockstrewn mound thought to be the remains of a
house or possibly a stone corral and dump. Arti­
facts consisted of bottle glass, stoneware,
transferware, and related household artifacts
that Carlson interpreted to date to a turn-of­
the-century occupation. Based on the physical
relationship of sites, common artifact assem­
blage, and historic documentation, 41MN5
(Sunnyside Community) and 41MN10 may both
represent portions of a tent-camp community
of Sunnyside. Further investigations into the
historic community may clear up the confusion.
On Carlson’s hand-drawn map found in the
TARL site file, the site appears immediately
west of Rambo Lane and spans ca. 75 m along
the FM 2092 right of way. No historic artifacts
were observed in the right of way. Because no
cultural materials were found in the right of way,
no further work was done at this site, and no
site revisit form was completed.
41MN11
Carlson recorded 41MN11, a burned rock
scatter with lithics, in 1991. The site follows the
32

Chapter 5: Sites and Localities Recorded
southern banks of the San Saba River immedi­
ately east of the mission site. A sparse scatter
of burned rocks, chert flakes, and rough tools
was observed at the time of recording.
On Carlson’s hand-drawn map found in the
TARL files, the southern end of the site extends
to FM 2092, spanning ca. 100 m along the right
of way. Several chert cobbles and flakes were
observed in the northern right of way, but these
were later determined to be noncultural, most
likely chert debris from local gravels brought in
as road fill. Backhoe Trenches 12 and 13 were
excavated in the southern right of way in the
vicinity of this site. Artificial fill layers were
exposed in the upper 15–30 cm of these trenches
followed by ca. 30 cm of very dark gray clay with
40–80 cm of brown clay loam. The two trenches
were excavated to ca. 150 cm in depth and ex­
posed a brown clay loam in the lower portions
of the trenches (see Appendix B). No prehistoric
materials were observed. Because no cultural
remains were found, no further work was con­
ducted at this site, and no site revisit form was
completed.

roadway, a slight 30-cm roadcut may have dis­
turbed this portion of the site, or the artifact
scatter may be limited to the house-barn con­
glomerate located ca. 100 m north of the road­
way.
Jerry Rambo referred to this locale as the
old Hinkle Dairy. In an interview, Rambo said,
“This used to be a dairy at one time back in the
’20s or the ’30s—there was a dairy here. And
Sammy Hinkle—he’s still living—his folks had
a dairy right there. And there was an old home
there. And this lake down behind this home was
fed by the ditch system there” (Jerry Rambo,
personal communication 2006).
41MN13, Doug Matthews
Grocery Store
Site 41MN13, a historic farmstead and gro­
cery store, is south of FM 2092 and is plotted
south of the irrigation ditch on the USGS
Chapman Draw quadrangle in the TARL map
file. Carlson (1991:68–69) originally recorded
the site in 1991, and a hand-drawn map found
in the TARL files shows the site extending north­
ward to FM 2092 and eastward to include an
existing structure. This site was reported as a
dense historic scatter in a field referred to by
the owner as the “old homesite” where her
grandfather had lived. However, the informant
did not provide specific dates. At the time of the
recording, visibility was 100 percent in the
plowed field, and artifacts indicative of an early­
twentieth-century occupation were observed.
Artifacts included blue Bristol-glazed stoneware
(ca. 1880–1920), whiteware (1805–1900), laven­
der bottle glass (1880–1918), and assorted metal.
Burned clay was observed to the south of the
field, but the owner attributed the burned clay
to bulldozing and burning of mesquite trees sev­
eral years earlier (Carlson 1991:68–69).
Current investigations were limited to vi­
sual inspection of the right of way, the excava­
tion of Auger Tests 28 and 29, and information
from a local informant. Auger Tests 28 and 29
were placed at the eastern and western extent
of the 41MN13 site boundaries on the south side
of FM 2092. Auger Test 28 reached 83 cm and
exposed pale brown silty loam with gravels
throughout. No artifacts were recovered, but the
remains of a home (a large concrete slab and
tin outbuildings) was noted in a field to the

41MN12
Site 41MN12 is located north of FM 2092
near the center of the project area and was origi­
nally recorded by Carlson (1991). This historic
homesite and prehistoric artifact scatter also
included a dense historic artifact scatter that
she suggested dates from approximately 1850
to the present. Artifacts observed included vari­
ous whitewares (1805–1900); aqua (1880–1916),
brown, and lavender bottle glass (1880–1918);
Albany-slipped stoneware (1900+); Bristolglazed stoneware (1920+); salt-glazed stoneware
(pre-1900); cut nails; and building hardware
(Carlson 1991:65–68). A 1907 Indianhead penny
was collected from the site at that time. Cores,
chert, and retouched flakes were also noted
around the house. Shovel tests were shallow
(30–40 cm) and recovered artifacts categorized
as historic household and building materials and
prehistoric lithics (Carlson 1991:65–68).
Current PAI investigations at 41MN12 in­
cluded surface inspection within the right of way,
photography of a lateral irrigation ditch, and
an interview with a local informant. No historic
artifacts were observed during extensive sur­
face inspection in the right of way. Although
Carlson’s hand-drawn site location maps show

south. Auger Test 29 reached 79 cm and exposed
light grayish brown silty loam with gravels
throughout. One piece of blue glass was recov­
ered. A 30-cm roadcut was noted adjacent to
Auger Test 29.
Jerry Rambo noted a storm cellar, concrete
slab, and cistern next to a small stone house
immediately south of FM 2092. He stated:

Current investigations included surface in­
spection and the excavation of Auger Tests 30–
37 and Shovel Tests 15-1–15-3 as well as limited
interviews with the homeowners. Auger Tests
30–37 were placed 50–100 m apart from the
western end of the previously recorded site
boundary to ca. 200 m east of the eastern bound­
ary. Auger Test 30 and 31 exposed 80 cm of fine
brown silty loam with gravels in the upper
40 cm. Auger Test 30 recovered one large pos­
sible tested cobble and one small corroded iron
fragment. A few flakes and one fire-cracked rock
were observed on the surface near the fence line
at this location. Auger Test 31 recovered 11 flake
fragments (probable road fill) and two thin metal
fragments. Auger Test 32 exposed 114 cm of
grayish brown clay loam with gravels in the
upper 30 cm and recovered one small flake. Au­
ger Test 33 exposed similar stratigraphy, but
reached a depth of 79 cm and was negative. One
possible flake fragment was recovered in Auger
Test 34 that exposed 82 cm of brown silty clay
loam with gravels throughout. Auger Tests 35–
37 were significantly more shallow, reaching
38 cm, 50 cm, and 28 cm respectively and expos­
ing grayish brown silty loam with gravels
throughout. Auger Test 35 recovered 3 possible
flakes; Auger Test 36 recovered 2 possible flakes,
several fragments of thin rusted metal, and one
fragment of turquoise glass (probable insulator
glass); Auger Test 37 recovered 3 flakes (re-fits)
that were most probably created by the auger.
Shovel Tests 15-1–15-3 were placed closer
to the fence line in somewhat less disturbed con­
text. Shovel Test 15-1 was placed 2 m west of
Auger Test 37, near the eastern extent of the
site. It exposed 50 cm of dark brown clay loam
with no gravels and recovered 1 small bifacially
flaked core in Level 2 (20–40 cm). Shovel Test
15-2 was placed 2 m east of Auger Test 36, ex­
posed 40 cm of dark brown silty loam, and was
negative. Shovel Test 15-3 was placed near the
center of the site extent along FM 2092, ca. 5 m
west of Kniffen Lane. The shovel test exposed
10 cm of dense gravels in brown silty loam and
was negative.
The original site size was recorded as 30
square meters, but the hand-drawn map in the
TARL site file shows the site spanning ca. 200 m
east-west with ca. 80 m extending to FM 2092.
Current investigations extend the site bound­
aries significantly, spanning 450 m east-west
along FM 2092. A TexSite archeological site re­

[Jerry Rambo, personal
communication 2006].
Site 41MN13 encompasses a large area with
at least two historic components. The Matthews
store is next to FM 2092 and a historic farm­
stead (with existing structures) located farther
to the southwest. There is little chance that any
significant historic deposits associated with the
Matthews store remain intact within the
FM 2092 right of way. Although no artifacts were
observed within the right of way along this por­
tion of FM 2092, a TexSite archeological site
revisit form was filed at TARL describing the
probable history of the site.
41MN15
Site 41MN15 is located north of FM 2092
and was recorded in 1991. Carlson described the
site as being on a knoll, with a prehistoric scat­
ter as well as historic materials scattered around
a brick house (1991:70–71). A sparse scatter of
historic materials, mainly on the north edge of
the knoll, included lavender bottle glass (1880–
1918), whiteware, and metal debris. The prehis­
toric component consisted of a burned rock
scatter with flakes, cores, and retouched flakes,
but no formal tools. One piece of unglazed
semiporcelain was collected at that time
(Carlson 1991:70–71).

of the site has very low research potential.

ment north of the road. A barn appears at this
location of the 1954 Texas Highway Department
engineering schematic for FM 2092, but no evi­
dence of this structure was observed during the
current investigation. Although no artifacts
were observed within the right of way along this
portion of FM 2092, a TexSite archeological site
revisit form was filed at TARL with revised site
boundaries.

41MN20
Site 41MN20 lies on a late Holocene allu­
vial terrace on the north side of FM 2092.
Carlson recorded a historic scatter around sev­
eral metal barns adjacent to the highway
(1991:73–74). Artifacts observed included
whiteware (1805–1900), Bristol-glazed stone­
ware (1920+), Albany-slipped stoneware (1900),
lavender bottle glass (1880–1918), and cut nails.
Numerous foundations, of relatively recent ori­
gin, were also noted. However, one foundation
that appeared to be somewhat older, possibly
turn-of-the-century, was observed in the grass
east of the driveway (Carlson 1991:73–74).
PAI investigations included three auger
tests and three shovel tests. Auger Tests 25–27
were placed ca. 100 m apart in the right of way
adjoining the site boundaries. Auger Test 25
exposed 100 cm of pale brown silty loam and
recovered one tested cobble and four fire-cracked
rocks. Auger Test 26 exposed 90 cm of light
brown sandy loam and recovered five flakes. And
Auger Test 27 exposed 52 cm of brown silty loam
with gravel in the upper 20 cm and recovered
10 flakes and one core.
Shovel Test 20-1 was placed 20 m south of a
white wooden well house and 6 m south of a clus­
ter of large oak trees. The shovel test exposed
50 cm of grayish brown gravelly silty loam and
recovered three pieces of bottle glass in the up­
per 20 cm, one piece of obsidian-like dark gray­
ish black glass, and one piece of clear bottle glass.
The lower 10 cm was negative. Shovel Test 20-2
exposed 10 cm of pale brown silt to silty loam
and recovered 1 possible flake. Three possible
flakes were observed on the surface near Shovel
Test 20-3. This test exposed 40 cm of silty clay
loam with dense small to medium-sized gravels
and recovered four pieces of lightly patinated
amber glass.
The site extent was originally recorded as
30 square meters. However, the hand-drawn
map in the site file shows the site extending
approximately 400 m along FM 2092. Current
investigations recovered and observed artifacts
in the right of way only along a ca. 100-m seg­

41MN21, Menard Irrigation
Company System
Carlson (1991:74–75) recorded the historic
Menard Irrigation Company Canal as 41MN21
in 1991. This canal is the main channel of an
extensive irrigation system that runs generally
west to east in a meandering course through the
San Saba River valley (see Figure 1). Over most
of its course, the canal is less than 1 km south
of and runs parallel to FM 2092. The canal runs
within 20 m of FM 2092 midway in the project
area, and the road crosses over the canal in the
eastern end of the project area.
A more complete history of the Menard irri­
gation system was presented earlier in this re­
port (see Chapter 3). The existing system dates
to the 1870s, but portions of the main canal were
built following the much older Spanish colonial
acequia (Doolittle 1995; Mark Wolf, personal
communication 2006). Its nineteenth-century
history is well known locally (Doolittle 1995).
The Vaughan Agricultural and Mechanical Ca­
nal Company was chartered and construction
on the canal began in 1874, and it extended for
5 miles to the east and west of Menard. Water
began running two years later, and the irriga­
tion was eventually expanded to cover more than
10 miles. “The Ditch,” as it was later dubbed,
irrigated approximately 2,000 acres and pro­
vided power to several gristmills in the San Saba
River valley. The irrigation canal is still used
today and is overseen by the Menard Irrigation
Company. A Texas historical subject marker at­
tests to the historical importance of this nine­
teenth-century irrigation system (Texas
Historical Commission 1972).
Before beginning the archeological survey,

irrigation system components. Locations where
the main irrigation canal and lateral ditches
crossed FM 2092 were put onto project area
maps and aerial photos, which were then used
by PAI personnel to guide the field survey.
Five crossings—one where FM 2092 crosses
the main canal about 1.6 km west of Fivemile
Crossing and four where it crosses smaller lat­
eral ditches—were plotted. Each location was
examined during the field survey. Black-and­
white and digital color photographs were taken
to document the resources at each location. The
only resources within the right of way were the
concrete-lined culverts that go under the road.
These almost certainly represent improve­
ments that were installed during the 1950s con­
struction of FM 2092. Current construction
plans for the improvements to FM 2092 state
that the bridges and culverts will not be al­
tered during this project (as specified in Work
Authorization No. 57536SA006). Other sub­
stantial components of the irrigation system,
such as concrete headgates, were observed near
the road, but all of these areas were located
outside the right of way and will not be im­
pacted by the project.

ish artifacts including majolica, olive jar, bur­
nished redware and native-made ceramic
sherds, container and flat glass, glass beads,
wrought nails, melted lead pieces, snipe hinges,
and chain links. Historic metal, glass, and ce­
ramics were also collected. Ground stone and a
hammerstone, melted objects, debitage, and
lithic tools were collected but have not been clas­
sified with the Spanish or Native American oc­
cupations. Snail shells, mussel shells, charcoal,
and bones were collected as well as wood and
ash samples. Also observed were more than
1,000 modern artifacts, including fence staples,
wire, scrap metal, nails, plastic, rubber, and
glass.
After the survey investigations were com­
pleted, intensive data recovery investigations
were undertaken at the mission site. The PAI
survey and data recovery investigations are
described in detail in a separate publication
(McWilliams et al. 2007).
NEWLY DISCOVERED SITES
The PAI survey of the 4.7 miles along
FM 2092 discovered and documented nine pre­
viously unrecorded sites within the TxDOT right
of way. These sites were assigned temporary field
numbers 2092-A through 2092-I during the sur­
vey, and shovel tests placed on each of the sites
were numbered consecutively. Electronic site
forms were submitted to the Texas Archeologi­
cal Sites Atlas, and permanent trinomial num­
bers 41MN53 to 41MN61 were subsequently
assigned to these sites. The following site de­
scriptions include setting, description of current
investigations, cultural materials observed,
identification of site type, horizontal and verti­
cal extent of cultural deposits, evaluation of
impacts to cultural deposits within the TxDOT
right of way, and evaluation of the site’s research
potential.

41MN23, Mission San Sabá
The location of Mission Santa Cruz de San
Sabá was discovered by Kay Hindes, Mark Wolf,
Kim Wolf, and Grant Hall in 1993. The current
investigations concentrated on finding missionrelated cultural deposits within the FM 2092
right of way. During the testing phase, 19 gradall
trenches, 11 test units, and 6 shovel tests were
dug. During the data recovery phase, 78 1x1-m
units, 4 1x0.5-m units, and two gradall-stripped
blocks were placed. In total, 21 features were
recorded. Two features are probable Spanish
colonial posts, and one is a probable Native
American bone deposit that dates to the Span­
ish occupation of the site. One is a small stain
that is probably Spanish, one is a long but spo­
radic ash lens (a probable result of the mission
massacre), two are small ash stains of unknown
function or date, one is a small unassociated pit,
three are tree root soil stains, and one is associ­
ated with fence disturbance. Also included are
nine recent historic/modern (ca. 1954) fence
posts or postholes.
Preliminary analysis of the artifacts col­
lected resulted in 22.4 kg of daub and 94 Span­

41MN53
Site 41MN53 is on a Pleistocene-age ter­
race ca. 1–2 m above the Holocene floodplain
of the San Saba River. A light prehistoric scat­
ter was observed on the surface. The excava­
tion of Backhoe Trench 4 confirmed that the
cultural deposits were limited to the upper
20 cm. The trench profile exhibited 28 cm of
gravelly fill material over 1.0 m of light brown
36

Chapter 5: Sites and Localities Recorded
silty clay loam (see Appendix B). Observed ar­
tifacts included a few scattered burned rocks,
widely scattered flakes (primarily tertiary and
bifacial thinning flakes), mussel shells, includ­
ing a few umbos, chert core, one chert unifacial
tool fragment, and one middle-stage biface
fragment. A few scattered early-twentieth­
century artifacts, including whiteware sherds,
bottle glass fragments, clear window glass
fragments, and a steel file handle, were ob­
served.
Auger Test 47 was placed at the western
end of the site and exposed 72 cm of pale brown
silty loam. Four probable flake fragments were
recovered in Auger Test 47. Both prehistoric
and historic artifacts were primarily observed
in the right of way on the south side of FM 2092.
The site spans 80 m east-west by 25 m northsouth, based on observations within the exist­
ing right of way. All artifacts were in a surface
context, which is disturbed. The portion of
41MN53 within the FM 2092 right of way has
a low research potential.

41MN55
Site 41MN55 is a Toyah phase artifact scat­
ter on a Pleistocene-age terrace overlooking the
San Saba River floodplain (Figure 8). The ter­
race surface, which is 4 to 5 m above the flood­
plain, is bisected by the road cut at the point
where FM 2092 rises up from the floodplain. The
terrace surface consists of grass-covered barrow
ditches flanked by level fallow agricultural fields
to the south and a small pecan orchard and
homestead to the north. An occupied rock house
is about 20 m north of the FM 2092 right of way
near the edge of the terrace. The edge of the ter­
race and the active San Saba River floodplain
are covered by pecan and elm trees. Prickly pear
and mesquite grow along the edge of the right
of way, particularly along the southern fence
line. The age of the landform is interpreted as
Pleistocene based on the stratigraphic profile
of Backhoe Trench 11 (at the east end of the
site), where a well-developed Bk or calcic hori­
zon was observed. The calcic horizon was ex­
posed from 102 to 125 cm in the trench, and it
presumably extends deeper. It has more than
50 percent carbonate nodules toward the bot­
tom of the trench, indicating that the alluvial
deposit is ancient.
Scattered burned rocks, chert flakes (pri­
mary, tertiary, and bifacial thinning flakes), two
utilized flake tools, two blade flakes, one pos­
sible limestone mano, three bone-tempered pot­
tery sherds, and mussel shell umbos and
fragments were observed. Artifacts were prima­
rily observed in the right of way on the north
side of FM 2092 but were also present on the
south. All artifacts were observed where the road
cuts down into the margin of the Pleistocene
terrace. Material appeared to be eroding down
the exposed road cut face, but fewer materials
were observed east of the terrace margin on the
intact terrace surface on both the north and
south sides of FM 2092. The site is 190 m eastwest by 25 m north-south.
Subsequent to the survey, National Regis­
ter testing was conducted at this site. The re­
sults of that investigation are reported in a
separate publication (McWilliams et al. 2007).

41MN54
Site 41MN54 is on a slight rise immediately
east of a small swale that is probably a fairly
recent overflow chute of the San Saba River.
Backhoe Trench 6 revealed fine-grained depos­
its in the swale, so the swale is not an old chan­
nel of the river. The artifacts observed included
a few scattered burned rocks, widely scattered
flakes including two secondary utilized flakes
and tertiary flakes, a chert uniface fragment, a
chert core, and mussel shell umbos and frag­
ments. Bottle glass was also observed in the
right of way. The site spans 30–40 m east-west
by ca. 25 m north-south within the existing right
of way. Artifacts were more common in the right
of way on the south side of FM 2092 but were
present north of the highway as well. Material
was concentrated in exposed areas. Some mate­
rial may have been brought up to the surface
when buried utility lines were dug. All artifacts
were found in a surface context—possibly reach­
ing a depth of 20 cm and in eroded area of the
right of way, which is disturbed. No diagnostics
were found, but the age of the deposit suggests
that these materials are late—probably within
the last 2,000 years. The portion of 41MN54
within the FM 2092 right of way has a low re­
search potential.

41MN56
Site 41MN56, located on a Late Holocene
alluvial terrace, consists of a few scattered

burned rocks, widely scattered flakes, and mus­
sel shells. The site was revealed in auger tests
and shovel tests placed the northern FM 2092
right of way. Auger Tests 1–4 exposed 72–100 cm
of road fill over pale brown to pinkish brown
clay to silty clay loam. Auger Test 1 recovered 2
flakes, and Auger Tests 2–4 recovered 1 flake
each. A biface was found near the northern rightof-way fence line at Auger Test 3. Shovel Tests
were placed between the positive auger tests to
establish depth of the deposit. Shovel Tests 56­
1 through 56-5 were negative. Shovel Test 56-6
yielded three flakes (one primary, one second­
ary, and one possible) and three mussel shell
fragments from Level 2 (20–40 cm). Level 3 (40–
60 cm) produced one mussel shell fragment.
Artifacts were primarily observed in the
right of way on the south side of FM 2092 and
were primarily in a surface context, which is
disturbed. A ca. 40-cm-deep road cut runs along
the northern side of FM 2092 at this location.
No cultural materials were observed on the
south side of FM 2092, which lies on a lower
plain. The site extent spans 160 m east-west by
2 m north-south (due to the roadcut). The por­
tion of 41MN56 within the FM 2092 right of way
has a low research potential.

rial. Artifacts were observed in the right of way
on the north side of FM 2092. Within the right
of way, the site spans 140 m east-west by 5 m
north-south. All artifacts are in a surface con­
text, which is disturbed. The portion of 41MN57
within the FM 2092 right of way has a low re­
search potential.
41MN58
Site 41MN58 lies on a Late Holocene allu­
vial terrace and was revealed in one auger test,
four shovel tests placed in a disturbed setting
within the existing FM 2092 right of way, and
surface scatter. Auger Test 9 exposed 103 cm of
pale brown silty sandy loam and recovered two
large flakes, one fire-cracked rock, and four
mussel shell fragments. Four shovel tests were
placed around the positive auger test to deter­
mine site extent and depth of the deposit. Shovel
Tests 58-1–58-3 exposed 10–20 cm of gravels
over a compact caliche layer (possibly road base).
Shovel Test 58-1 recovered one flake, Shovel Test
58-2 recovered one piece of fire-cracked chert,
and Shovel Test 58-3 recovered one piece of firecracked chert and one piece of fire-cracked rock.
Shovel Test 58-4 (0–40 cm) exposed 20 cm of
similar upper deposits but extended to 40 cm,
becoming compact. Shovel Test 58-4 recovered
one flake in Level 1 (0–20 cm) and one piece of
thin black glass in Level 2 (20–40 cm). Several
scattered burned rocks were also observed on
the surface.
Site 41MN58 spans 170 m east-west by 5 m
north-south as seen in auger and shovel tests
as well as surface scatter. Artifacts were only
observed in the right of way on the north side of
FM 2092, in a disturbed surface context. The
portion of 41MN58 within the FM 2092 right of
way has a low research potential.

41MN57
Site 41MN57, which lies on a Late Holocene
alluvial terrace, consists of two areas of widely
scattered flakes and one core observed on the
surface. The site was revealed in auger tests and
shovel tests placed in a disturbed setting within
the existing FM 2092 right of way. Auger Tests
13 and 14 both exposed 104 cm of pale brown
silty loam with gravels throughout. Auger Test
13 recovered three flakes, one mussel shell
umbo, two mussel shell fragments, and one
whiteware sherd. Auger Test 14 recovered two
flakes. Four shovel tests were placed between
the auger tests to determine the depth of the
deposit. Shovel Tests 57-1, 57-3, and 57-4 were
negative. Shovel Test 57-2 recovered one core
(unifacially flaked), one piece of weathered bone,
and three pieces of modern bottle glass in Level
1 (0–20 cm).
Auger tests were positive, necessitating
shovel tests, which revealed only a light surface
scatter of prehistoric artifacts, one whiteware
sherd, a bone fragment (which could be mod­
ern, historic, or prehistoric), and modern mate­

41MN59
Site 41MN59 lies on a Late Holocene allu­
vial terrace. The site was revealed in auger tests
placed in a disturbed setting within the exist­
ing FM 2092 right of way as well as a surface
scatter. Auger Test 49 exposed 84 cm of brown
silty loam with gravels and recovered eight
mussel shell umbos and mussel shell fragments.
Auger Test 50 reached 79 cm and exposed a simi­
lar profile. Auger Test 50 recovered three flakes,
two mussel shell umbos, and mussel shell frag­

ments. Five fire-cracked rocks, one core, and
mussel shell fragments were also observed on
the surface.
Site 41MN59 consists of a few scattered
burned rocks, very widely scattered flakes, and
mussel shells. Three flakes and one fire-cracked
rock were found in the right of way near Auger
Test 49. Three additional flakes, one core, and
four fire-cracked rocks were found scattered
between Auger Test 49 and Auger Test 50 and
to the east. Artifacts were only observed in the
right of way on the north side of FM 2092. The
site spans 170 m east-west by 5 m north-south
on the north side of FM 2092 only. All artifacts
are in a surface context, which is extensively
disturbed within the right of way. It appears that
artifacts extend into the plowed field to the
north. The portion of 41MN59 within the FM
2092 right of way has a low research potential.

eight corroded metal scraps, two bone fragments,
and one piece of wire from Level 3 (40–60 cm);
and three pieces of wire and two corroded metal
scraps from Level 4 (60–80 cm).
Shovel Tests 60-2 exposed more than 20
pieces of clear thin bottle glass, one aqua glass
fragment, two sherds of a decorative
transferware teacup from Level 1 (0–20 cm), and
one transferware sherd (same as above), one cut
nail, three metal can rim fragments, one frag­
ment of patinated clear glass, one burned cut
bone fragment, and charcoal from Level 2 (20–
40 cm). Levels 3 (40–60 cm) and 4 (60–80 cm)
were negative. Finally, Shovel Test 60-3 recov­
ered a .22-caliber cartridge case, one corroded
piece of scrap metal, one undecorated whiteware
sherd, patinated bottle glass (two oxidized, one
aqua, two clear), one metal bottle cap, and foil
from Level 1 (0–20 cm); and one fence staple,
three corroded pieces of metal, one large
whiteware sherd, and one gold-painted
whiteware sherd from Level 2 (20–40 cm). Level
3 (40–50 cm) was negative.
Site 41MN60 extends 120 m east-west by
2 m north-south, truncated by a roadcut. A house
appears in this location—close to the old road—
on the 1954 Texas Highway Department engi­
neering schematic for FM 2092. The house may
have been moved or burned during the 1954
roadwork or possibly at a later date. The his­
toric archeological remains within the FM 2092
right of way have a low research potential.

41MN60
Site 41MN60, which lies on a Late Holocene
alluvial terrace, is a historic farmstead with a
light prehistoric scatter. The site was revealed
in auger tests and shovel tests placed in a dis­
turbed setting within the existing FM 2092 right
of way. Auger Tests 18–20 were placed to the
east and west of an extant wooden windmill
stand overlying a brick well and an extensive
surface scatter of cinder blocks, bricks, and his­
toric debris outside the right of way. Auger Tests
18–20 exposed 80–95 cm of grayish brown silty
loam, with gravels in the upper 30 cm. Auger
Test 19 recovered 6 possible flakes, charcoal,
eight pieces of corroded iron, one lightly
patinated clear class, one aqua mold-formed
glass fragment, and one small animal long bone
with spiral fracture. Auger Test 19 exposed six
probable flakes and a probable twentiethcentury iron wire fence staple. Auger Test 20
recovered several fragments of corroded iron
(probable twentieth-century artifacts).
Three shovel tests were placed in between
and west of the auger tests. Shovel Tests 60-1–
60-3 exposed 50–80 cm of moist brown silty loam.
Shovel Test 60-1 produced one milk glass bottle
rim, one washer, three corroded metal scraps, one
tin can piece, one cut long bone fragment, one
piece of wire, one clear glass from Level 1 (0–
20 cm); one flake, eight corroded metal scraps,
two pieces of wire, two clear glass fragments, and
a small animal vertebra from Level 2 (20–40 cm);

41MN61
Site 41MN61, which lies on a Late Holocene
alluvial terrace, is the northern extent of a homesite. The site was observed as extending out from
yards of two homes: A large nineteenth-century
wooden two-story house ca 30 m south of the right
of way and a small 1920s–’30s stone cottage ca.
15 m south of the right of way. The site was re­
vealed in auger tests and shovel tests placed in a
disturbed setting within the existing FM 2092
right of way. Auger Test 21 recovered two flakes.
Auger Test 22 recovered an old metal can and
one small fragment of rusted iron, and Auger Test
23 recovered two flakes. Shovel Tests 61-1–61-3
were placed between the auger tests. Shovel Test
61-3 was the only positive shovel test, with one
flake found in Level 1 (0–10 cm). No cultural
material was observed on the surface.

right of way. A tombstone enclosed in a wroughtiron fence can be seen about 20 yards north of
FM 2092, about 1 mile east of Menard and 40 ft
north of the highway. Protected in an oak tree
motte, the tombstone marks the grave of Tull B.
Smith (also written Tullos B. Smith and Tully V.
Smith). Information on the graves was collected
from the Internet, the Menard County History
and Anthology, an interview with local infor­
mant, Jerry Rambo, and e-mails from Alicia
Brown, a local volunteer with the TXGenWeb
Project.
Tully B. Smith is listed as a country store­
keeper, age 37, in the 1870 Menard Census. He
is listed along with his presumed wife,
Cynthia E. Smith, and children Lucilla A. (9),
Brooklin (5), Robert S. (2), and Abijah/Alijah (4
mo.), as well as Saul Smith (70) and John M.
Fuller (27), a salesman in the store (Brown
2006). Brown states that Tully was born Janu­
ary 14, 1833, and died January 10, 1871. East
of his headstone is a concrete slab. Two more
concrete slabs are east of the iron fence. Jerry
Rambo stated that one additional tombstone
was present in the 1940s, when his uncle and
aunt owned the land. The second headstone and
parts of the fence were stolen over the years.

HISTORIC LOCALITIES
IDENTIFIED IN ARCHIVAL
RECORDS OR BY INFORMANTS
Seventeen historic localities were identified
next to FM 2092 through archival research and
oral history interviews. Although the road sec­
tions closest to each of these locations were
closely examined, no cultural materials or other
physical evidence associated with any of these
localities were found within the road right of
way. Consequently, these localities were not re­
corded as archeological sites, but they include
the following types of resources: irrigation lat­
erals and other old ditches; historic graves; his­
toric road bridges; homesites; the location of the
original Mission San Sabá historical monument;
sections of wagon roads, a Texas Rangers’ camp,
and the general location of a possible Spanish
colonial-age smelter. Figure 9 shows the loca­
tions of these historic localities and ditch seg­
ments plotted on the modern aerial photograph.

This is where your river makes
a bend and goes north there.
We’re right on that curve in the
road. And right straight in front
of us where those live oaks are
is where your graves are...on
the north side of the road...My
uncle and aunt owned the
property at one time. And they
didn’t want those graves
disturbed but people were
taking the steel fences and one
of the steel fences is still around
the marker....See there’s a stone
there, well there were two of
those when my aunt and uncle
owned the property [Jerry
Rambo, personal communi­
cation 2006].

Ditch Crossings 1–5
Four crossings of irrigation laterals and the
main canal were photographed between the
Menard city limits and Fivemile Crossing (see
Figure 9). These were assigned Ditch Crossing
numbers 1–5 moving west to east through the
project area. The four laterals are limited to con­
crete ditches within the right of way, but water
“gates” are present at some locations immedi­
ately beyond the right of way. Technically, these
laterals should be part of 41MN21, which
Carlson (1991) originally recorded to designate
the main irrigation canal, which is Ditch Cross­
ing 5 (see 41MN21 earlier in this chapter). These
laterals are discussed in Chapter 3 as compo­
nents of the irrigation system administered by
the Menard Irrigation Company.

Alicia Brown, a local genealogist, has col­
lected information about Tull Smith from ar­
ticles, conversations, and records but cannot
confirm their accuracy. She has learned that
Smith’s wife may have been Cynthia B. Russell,

and there is a possibility that her burial may be
next to Smith’s and was marked by the second
(missing) headstone.
According to local lore, Tull was on his way
home one day when Indians attacked him. How­
ever, it appeared that “he had been shot with a
gun and an arrow was placed in the wound to
make it look like an Indian had done it” (Brown
2006). The West Texas Frontier by Joseph Carroll
McConnell (McConnell 1933) provides another
version of the story:

be adults…two or three small children of his are
buried east of Menard in what is now a field.
The small tombstones can still be seen under
some live oak trees” (Brown 2006). One publi­
cation claims that a young woman who had been
scalped and later died was buried one-half mile
east of Menard, suggesting yet another burial
in the vicinity (Menard County Historical Soci­
ety 1982).
One lady told of some travelers
who came to Menard, bringing
with them a woman of
undetermined age who had
been scalped. They had found
her lying on the bank of Scalp
Creek, but she died shortly
thereafter. Another man said
this brother-in-law told him
that the woman scalped by the
Indians was a sixteen year old
white girl who had red hair. He
thinks she is buried about one
half mile east of Menard on the
Five Mile Road [Menard
County Historical Society
1982].

Tullos B. Smith was returning
late in the evening to his home
in Menard, from the Wilkerson
Ranch, about sixteen miles
away, was mounted on a large
black pony, and was leading
about two other horses. As he
passed a cluster of bushes, a few
miles from his destination,
Tullos B. Smith was ambushed
and killed. Late in the evening
the stage going from San
Antonio to El Paso came along
and found him. Since he was
not scalped, some local citizens
thought perhaps he may not
have been killed by Indians.
Searching parties soon found
moccasin tracks, however, and
other Indian signs. Wm.
Templeton, Lewis Wilson and
David Thorp brought Tullos B.
Smith’s body to Menard in a
spring wagon. Note: Author
interviewed: J. F. P. Kruse, who
intended to accompany
Tullos B. Smith to the
Wilkerson Ranch but was
unable to find his pony; Mr. and
Mrs. Ben Ellis and Mr. and Mrs.
J. D. Carlisle, who were early
settlers in that section
[McConnell 1933].

The burials were assigned historic localities
1–4, representing (1) the marked grave of Tull
Smith; (2) possible unmarked grave (headstone
reportedly stolen) next to Smith; (3) possible
unmarked grave(s) of the Bradford children; and
(4) possible unmarked grave of the scalped
woman. No archaeological site forms were com­
pleted because the graves are located on private
property and could not be examined.
This information suggests that additional
graves may be located beyond the iron fence and
could extend into the FM 2092 right of way. PAI
personnel conducted gradall scraping at this
location, but no addition graves were found.
More information on this investigation is found
in the summary of gradall trenching in Chap­
ter 4.

It is also reported that J. P. Kruse married
Tull’s widow, Cynthia (Brown 2006).
Other references state that three children
of the Bradford family are buried here. Brown
quotes an excerpt from the Menard News Cen­
tennial Edition (dated November 11, 1971):
“Adam Bradford reared seventeen children to

little concrete archway with minimal rockwork
on the edges. Jerry Rambo stated that this
bridge was located along the original route of
FM 2092 but was avoided during the 1954 pav­
ing, when a curve was straightened.
In an interview, he said, “OK, now this curve
here has been changed. I can show you the old
wagon or gravel road that was traveled when it
was gravel because they had a bridge over at
that time—over Harris Hollow to the south side
of the road…” (Jerry Rambo, personal commu­
nication 2006). He recalled that he traveled over
the bridge when he was young.
No sign of the roadway was observed in the
right of way; construction and maintenance of
FM 2092 may have obliterated the original road.

ered part of recorded archeological sites. Based
on artifacts found at these localities, they are
now linked with historic archeological sites
41MN60, 41MN61, and 41MN13, respectively,
and are described above.
Historic Locality 11
Historic locality 11 is a slight swale running
north-south across the FM 2092 right of way, just
west of Monte and Suzie Lyckman’s house. It is
all that remains of an irrigation lateral at the
far western end of the Mission San Sabá site
(41MN23). This ditch once had a metal flume
that carried water over Harris Hollow, about
100 m north of FM 2092. The ditch has been
abandoned, and the flume has been gone for
many years (Jerry Rambo, personal communi­
cation 2006; Monte Lyckman, personal commu­
nication 2006).

Historic Locality 6
Historic locality 6, the location of the origi­
nal historic marker for the Mission San Sabá,
is ca. 2 miles east of Menard. The marker was
placed south of a large motte of oak trees in what
was once thought to be the original mission lo­
cation. Many locals stated that they believed the
mission was at that location for so many years
because that is where the marker was placed in
1936. Carlson recorded a prehistoric lithic scat­
ter and historic farmstead in the oak motte in
1991. Historic artifacts from 41MN22 are sug­
gestive of a turn-of-the-century domestic site
(Carlson 1991).

Historic Locality 12
In his 1901 map, J. J. Callan indicated a place
close to Mission San Sabá that he labeled “Presidio.
Smelter.” It is not clear what this represents. Be­
cause of its location, it is possible that Callan in­
terpreted the mission remains as those of a
smelter, but this interpretation is speculative.
Historic Locality 13
A historic wagon road to the river was used
in the 1910–1930s. It is assigned historic local­
ity 13. The road was located just east of the mis­
sion, where the river dips southward. Before the
1940s, the river ran farther north, and a huge
spring flowed at this location. It was a popular
swimming hole and picnic location in the 1910s–
1930s, according to Jerry Rambo (personal com­
munication 2006).

Historic Locality 7
Historic locality 7 is a whitewashed stone
well house that is immediately south of the right
of way, ca. 1.7 miles east of Menard. Three au­
ger tests were placed northeast, north, and
northwest of the well house, below a ca. 1 m
roadcut. The tests, placed in a disturbed setting
due to the roadcut, were negative. Several large
rocks extend into the right of way within the
roadcut and could be part of base of the well
house. Jerry Rambo said that the well house was
made of hand-hewn limestone that was plas­
tered and painted white (Jerry Rambo, personal
communication 2006).

Historic Locality 14
A linear depression can be seen extending
across a field east of the mission. Mark Wolf
observed this north-northeasterly line in an
aerial photo and considers it to be a possible old
wagon road. The linear feature is probably an
old road. It runs through 41MN5, a historic site
recorded in a 1990 survey by Texas A&M Uni­
versity (see description earlier in this chapter
[Carlson 1991]). Additional research suggests

Historic Locality 16

that both 41MN5 and this linear feature are
remains of a historic settlement called
Sunnyside (Smyrl 2001). The settlement was
established for workers of the Gus Noyes farm
and perhaps was occupied by workers who
helped expand the irrigation ditch. Sunnyside,
located 3 miles east of Menard and 1 mile west
of the Noyes farm, was apparently present in
the 1880s but does not appear on 1940s county
maps. The community consisted of a cotton gin,
a store, and a school, although homes or a tent
camp were probably also present. Jerry Rambo
reported that his father attended school at this
location (Jerry Rambo, personal communication
2006). Carlson (1991) recorded a gin and a his­
toric scatter as 41MN5, and the field is referred
to as the McDaniels’ place.

Historic locality 16 is a concrete bridge
over an unnamed drainage, which is really little
more than a swale. The bridge was once on the
county road, but it has been abandoned since
the 1954 construction of FM 2092. The 1954
aerial photograph shows that this bridge was
near a bend in the country road, and that it was
cut off when FM 2092 was built. The bridge
location is now about 30 m to 40 m north of
FM 2092, just northeast of 41MN53. A linear
concentration of gravels, easily visible from
FM 2092, marks the location of the old county
road in this area.
Historic Locality 17
Historic locality 17, the possible location of
a Texas Rangers’ camp and tent camp of Cap­
tain Dan Roberts, is ca. 0.8 km north of FM 2092,
ca. 2 miles east of Menard. The camp was de­
scribed in a publication containing the memoirs
of Captain Dan Roberts and those of his wife
(Roberts and Roberts 1987). The camp was re­
portedly 2 miles east of Menard, but the home
of Captain Roberts and his wife was 1.5 miles
east of Menard, possibly set away from the camp
for privacy. The camp was in this vicinity from
1875 to 1878.

Historic Locality 15
A probable old wagon road is recorded as
historic locality 15 based on information from
local informant Jerry Rambo (personal commu­
nication 2006). The old road turned northward
off of FM 2092 at the far eastern end of the
project area, and it is reported to have predated
the existing paved highway. A modern road
called Vinegaroon Road runs at a northeasterly
direction of FM 2092 at this general location and
may follow the old wagon road.

EVALUATION OF PROJECT-RELATED IMPACTS,
AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Douglas K. Boyd and Jennifer K. McWilliams

The intensive archeological survey resulted
in documentation of 19 archeological sites that
are adjacent to or within the FM 2092 right of
way owned by the State of Texas (see Table 5).
Four are previously recorded sites that are ad­
jacent to the road and presumably have remains
that extend (or once extended) into the road­
way, but no archeological remains were observed
within the right of way. Six are previously re­
corded sites where remains were found inside
the right of way. Nine are newly discovered sites.
Of these 19 sites, 6 have prehistoric components,
4 have historic components, and 9 have both
prehistoric and historic components.

grouped as prehistoric and historic sites. Two
sites—the Menard Irrigation Company system
and Mission San Sabá—are discussed sepa­
rately. Seventeen historic localities, for which
historical evidence was examined, also are dis­
cussed. The remainder of this report presents
the assessments and recommendations for these
resources (see Boyd et al. 2006).
PREHISTORIC SITES
Fifteen sites adjacent to or within the
FM 2092 right of way have prehistoric compo­
nents (see Tables 3 and 5). At four previously
recorded sites, PAI found no evidence that cul­
tural remains actually extended into the right
of way, and these sites (41MN5, 41MN9,
41MN11, and 41MN12) were recommended as
not eligible for listing in the National Register
or for designation as SALs. Prehistoric remains
found within the right of way at two sites repre­
sent low-density ephemeral occupations in dis­
turbed contexts. The prehistoric components at
these sites, 41MN15 and 41MN23, were recom­
mended as not eligible for listing on the National
Register or for designation as SALs.
Prehistoric components were present in the
TxDOT right of way at all nine of the newly re­
corded sites. All of these components are low-den­
sity artifact scatters where no buried occupation
zones or cultural features were identified.At eight
of these sites, the prehistoric remains within the
right of way appear to be in extensively disturbed
contexts due to previous agricultural activities
(i.e., plowing) and later FM 2092 construction.The
prehistoric components at each of these eight sites
(41MN53, 41MN54, and 41MN56–61) were rec­
ommended as not eligible for listing in the Na­
tional Register or for designation as SALs.

PRELIMINARY SURVEY REPORT
AND PROJECT REVIEW BY
TxDOT AND THC
All of the sites documented along FM 2092
were described in a preliminary report submit­
ted to TxDOT-ENV (Boyd et al. 2006). The pre­
liminary report was reviewed by TxDOT-ENV
and THC, and they concurred with all of the rec­
ommendations that were made. Table 6 sum­
marizes the assessments and recommendations
for the 19 sites adjacent to or within the
FM 2092 right of way. The archeological sites
were evaluated for potential to be listed on the
National Register of Historic Places (National
Register) under Criterion D, according to Sec­
tion 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (16 USC 470 et seq.; 36 CFR 800), and for
potential for designation as a State Archeologi­
cal Landmark (SAL), according to the Antiqui­
ties Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resources
Code, Title 9, Chapter 191; 13 TAC 26).
For the purpose of discussing site assess­
ments and recommendations, these sites are

Chapter 6: Assessments and Management Recommendations
Site 41MN55 is a prehistoric campsite lo­
cated on an older alluvial terrace just east of
Fivemile Crossing. The site is exposed on both
the north and south sides of FM 2092, and the
finding of bone-tempered pottery and a Plainsstyle end scraper suggest that it represents a
Toyah phase occupation. It appears that the
deposits along the north and south fence lines
have not been disturbed because the road was
cut down deeply into the terrace, leaving intact
deposits near the edge of the terrace well above
the level of the road. Because of the possibility
that this site contains a discrete Toyah phase
occupation, it was recommended that it is po­
tentially eligible for listing in the National Reg­
ister and for designation as a SAL. It also was
recommended that archeological testing was
needed to define the nature and contextual in­
tegrity of the prehistoric deposits and provide
sufficient data for a thorough assessment of
National Register and SAL eligibility. A testing
effort of 10 test units (each 1x1 m and hand dug
to ca. 40 cm below surface for a total of 4.0 cubic
meters) was recommended as an appropriate
level of work and was carried out in November
2006. Results of this work are reported in
McWilliams et al. (2007).

the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries.
Although historic features associated with some
of these sites were observed outside the right of
way, no features were observed in the right of
way, and all of the observed artifacts came from
disturbed contexts. Given the evidence for ex­
tensive disturbance to the deposits (due to pre­
vious agricultural activities and subsequent
construction of the county road and FM 2092)
throughout the project corridor, the potential for
intact historic deposits and features inside the
right of way was considered minimal. It was rec­
ommended that the historic components inside
the right of way at each of these four sites
(41MN53, 41MN54, 41MN60, and 41MN61) are
not eligible for listing in the National Register
or for designation as SALs.
41MN21, MENARD IRRIGATION
COMPANY SYSTEM
As recorded at TARL, 41MN21 includes the
main irrigation canal of the Menard Irrigation
Company, which was founded in the 1870s and
is still in operation today. The many smaller lat­
eral ditches that branch off the main system are
not documented as part of the site, but they are
clearly part of the same system. Historic archi­
val and oral history research identified many
gaps in the records of the Menard Irrigation
Company. No maps of the entire irrigation sys­
tem were found, and the company records do
not clearly define the construction sequence and
history of different parts of the system. No at­
tempt was made during this project to map all
of the lateral ditches that are outside the
FM 2092 project area.
Based on a July 2004 letter agreement be­
tween TxDOT and THC, several relevant points
were considered to establish the National Reg­
ister eligibility potential for a historic irrigation
system under Section 106 review. For the south
Texas region, Jensen (2004:1) states that:

HISTORIC SITES
Excluding the Menard Irrigation Company
and Mission San Sabá (discussed below), there
were 11 sites with historic components (see
Tables 3 and 5). At seven previously recorded
sites documented as being adjacent to FM 2092,
minimal or no evidence of the historic compo­
nent was found inside the right of way. In some
cases, minimal effort was expended to search
for late-nineteenth or early-twentieth-century
remains inside the right of way because the de­
posits in the right of way are extensively dis­
turbed. The portions of these seven sites
(41MN5, 41MN9, 41MN10, 41MN12, 41MN13,
41MN15, and 41MN20) inside the right of way
were recommended as not eligible for listing in
the National Register or for designation as
SALs.
Historic components were found at four of
the newly recorded sites. Historic artifacts were
observed on surface or in auger and shovel tests.
At each of these sites, the archeological remains
found within the right of way are limited to
nondiagnostic artifacts that date generically to

Cultural resource studies in
this region will subsequently
address the following points to
establish eligibility for
purposes of Section 106 review:
1. brief history of the origins of the
system
2. a general understanding of the
49

Survey of FM 2092 from Menard to Fivemile Crossing
current and historic extent of the system
3. known programs of improve­
ments, based on interviews with the dis­
trict management
4. establishment of historic integrity
without further documentation require­
ments when these investigations reveal
that at least 50% of the system as a
whole continues to survive.

41MN23, MISSION SAN SABA
For this project, the Mission San Sabá
search area was defined as approximately 400 m
(0.3 miles) east to west along FM 2092, and it
included the entire TxDOT right of way on the
north and south sides of the road. This area is
located immediately south of the main mission
compound, which is located on private land and
was intensively investigated by Texas Tech Uni­
versity archeologists from 1993 to 1997 under
the direction of Grant D. Hall. Extensively in­
vestigated with both mechanical and hand ex­
cavations, the area where the main mission
compound was located has been almost com­
pletely excavated (Grant Hall, personal commu­
nication 2006), but only the 1993 season of work
has been reported (Hindes et al. 1995).
The PAI survey phase investigations (see
Chapter 5) examined both north and south of
the road, and extensive disturbances from the
1954 construction of FM 2092 were observed.
Within the larger Mission Search Area, PAI ar­
cheologists excavated 19 gradall trenches, 11
test units, and 6 shovel tests. No evidence of
Spanish colonial deposits was found south of the
road. Intact deposits containing the Spanish
colonial zone were found only in a narrow strip
immediately adjacent to the north right-of-way
fence. The Spanish colonial zone is a ca. 30-cm­
thick layer of Spanish artifacts and features
defined by the previous Texas Tech investiga­
tions (Hindes et al. 1995:24–25).
At the conclusion of the survey phase, PAI
archeologists recommended that the remains of
Mission San Sabá within the FM 2092 right of
way should be considered eligible for listing in
the National Register and for designation as an
SAL (Boyd et al. 2006). TxDOT and THC con­
curred with this recommendation, and TxDOT
immediately issued a work authorization direct­
ing PAI to conduct archeological data recovery
of the Spanish colonial remains within the
FM 2092 right of way. The data recovery phase
at Mission San Sabá was conducted between
November 2006 and February 2007. PAI arche­
ologists excavated 78 1x1-m units and 4 1x0.5­
m units. Extensive mechanical stripping was
also conducted in a final effort to search for bur­
ied features in the TxDOT right of way north of
FM 2092. Because this work investigated vir­
tually all of the intact Spanish colonial deposits
in the FM 2092 right of way, it effectively miti­

Although the Menard Irrigation Company
system is in a different region of Texas, these
requirements would still generally apply when
considering its eligibility for listing in the Na­
tional Register. Based on the limited research
conducted for the current FM 2092 project, and
considering the eligibility requirements imple­
mented by TxDOT and THC, PAI cannot ad­
equately evaluate the National Register
eligibility of the historic Menard Irrigation Com­
pany system at this time. More research is
needed to develop a meaningful historic context
for understanding the irrigation system relative
to late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century
agricultural developments. Comparisons be­
tween the Menard Irrigation Company system
and other contemporaneous irrigation systems
in the region would be helpful. At least two irri­
gation systems operated in nearby San Saba
County: the Fleming San Saba Irrigation Com­
pany canal, dating to 1875 (Upchurch 1946) and
the Sloan Ditch, dating to about 1880 (Greene
2001). In addition, a field reconnaissance sur­
vey is needed to establish the integrity of the
various components of the irrigation system,
most of which are on private property. Until this
work can be done, it is appropriate to consider
the irrigation district potentially eligible for list­
ing in the National Register. A state historical
subject marker attests to the historical impor­
tance of this nineteenth-century irrigation sys­
tem (Texas Historical Commission 1972).
Although the FM 2092 project will involve
restoring, resurfacing, and widening the paved
road, it appears that the current construction
plans will not impact any of the five identified
irrigation system areas. As specified in Work
Authorization No. 57536SA006, current con­
struction plans specifically states that no
bridges or culverts will be altered. Consequently,
it was recommended that no further historical
or archeological work is needed for the irriga­
tion district in conjunction with this project.

walked from the mission site to downtown
Menard to rededicate the old Catholic Church
that was recently renovated. The community
and presidio restoration board also hosted the
annual Texas Archeological Society field school
at Presidio San Sabá June 9–16, 2007, which
was directed by Texas Tech University arche­
ologist Dr. Tamra Walter. TxDOT’s Archeologi­
cal Studies Branch and PAI viewed these large
public events as an opportunity for public out­
reach associated with the FM 2092 road im­
provement project. In conjunction with the
Phase II archeological data recovery investiga­
tions (see McWilliams et al. 2007), PAI research­
ers produced a popular brochure titled “The
Menard Irrigation Canal: 250 Years of Agricul­
tural History, 1757–2007” (Prewitt and Associ­
ates, Inc. 2007). This brochure outlined the
history of the entire irrigation system and pre­
sented evidence that portions of the 1874 canal
followed the “Old Spanish Ditch” built and used
by the people living at Presidio San Sabá from
1757 to 1772. Five thousand copies of this 4­
fold, 11x17-inch brochure were printed and de­
livered to the local community. Many of the
brochures were distributed in the Menard area
during the June 2007 events commemorating
the founding of the mission and presidio.

HISTORIC LOCALITIES
Seventeen historic localities were identified
in archival documents or by informants along
the 4.9-mile-long project area. While the re­
search provided interesting, informative, and
often conflicting historical data, none of these
historic locations will be impacted by the pro­
posed road construction. No further research or
investigations were recommended for these lo­
calities.
PUBLIC OUTREACH BROCHURE
The year 2007 marked the 250th anniver­
sary of the founding of the mission and presidio.
The community of Menard and the Presidio de
San Saba Restoration Board hosted several pub­
lic events in the summer of 2007 to commemo­
rate these historic events. A Pilgrimage Walk
was held on June 8, 2007, and many people

for the San Saba River Valley
Near Menard, Texas

Compiled by Jennifer K. McWilliams

This appendix presents historical and mod­
ern observations about historic events and loca­
tions along FM 2092 east of Menard. Some
observations are keyed to identified historic sites
or documented historical localities, but many are
general references that cannot be linked to a spe­
cific location. Site locations are shown in Figure
7, and historic localities are shown in Figure 9.
This information was compiled during the
research phase of this project. All of the historic
resources included in this table are historic sites
or general historic localities dating to the nine-

teenth and early twentieth centuries during the
period of Anglo-American settlement. Some ob­
servations that may pertain to the historic pe­
riod or the earlier Spanish colonial period are
included. However, observations that pertain
only to Spanish colonial resources (such as the
presidio and mission and associated roads and
acequias), are excluded from this table. Obser­
vations on the Spanish colonial resources will
be presented in a separate report on the archeo­
logical investigations at the mission site
(41MN23).

41MN5 Cotton gin
“The historic component of this site is focused
upon an extant cotton gin located east of
Menard. Three associated scatters were
identified with the cotton gin and all are
restricted to an area bounded on the south by
State Highway [sic] 2092, on the east by the
Menard Irrigation Company Canal, on the
north by the San Saba River, and on the west
by a road dividing two properties. The owner
referred to this area as her ‘dry’ field. Three
distinct historic artifact scatters were found in
the field and probably represent the remains
of a farmstead associated with the gin. The
scatter nearest State Highway 2092 had the
greatest density and no doubt represents the
house site while the other two may have been
outbuildings... [extensive artifact list]. The
artifacts examined in the field were scattered
from State Highway 2092 northward to a
fenceline which traversed the highest portion
of the field at an angle parallel to the
highway.”
41MN5 Cotton gin

“This land was real fertile in here. My daddy
and them farmed this field right in here
[across FM 2092 from Lyckman’s house].
Across the road over there. And man they used
to raise alfalfa and cotton. And Mr. Noyes had
the gin over there. And that’s right across the
fence from my place. The old cement—or
rocks—are still there.”

more liberal in giving the people homes. I
think it was the Fourteenth Legislature that
offered land subsidy, to encourage irrigation,
specifying the dimensions of a ditch to carry
the water, say six feet wide, at the bottom of
the ditch, and twelve feet wide, from cut to cut
across the top, and four feet deep, on level
ground. For this class of ditch, the state
offered three sections of land to the mile of
ditch, not otherwise appropriated, to the
makers of that grade of ditches. The state not
reserving any rental, or any further claim on

originated as a result of the efforts of

Vaughan Ditch Agricultural Mechanical
Company with a term of 30 years beginning
July 24, 1874 (Records of the Secretary State).
The Menard Irrigation Company was
subsequently chartered in 1904, and
rechartered in 1954, to maintain and operate
dams, reservoirs, lakes, wells, canals, flumes,
laterals and other functions necessary for the
purpose of irrigation, milling, and
stockraising. The water for these operations
was to come from the San Saba River by a
ditch commencing 4.5 miles above the town of
Menardville, Menard County, Texas, on the
south side of the San Saba River, and
extending five miles below the town of
Menardville (Records of the Secretary State,
Domestic Charter #13602). This ditch, begun
in 1874, was in place at least by 1913 when it
was mapped by W.P. Doty, County Surveyor,
for the Mamie Irrigation and Mill Co. (Menard

Humpy Jackson would “conceal himself on one
of the many peeks overlooking the road…. And
before [the African American soldiers] got by
[another one was killed]. It is even asserted
that the road from Fort McKavett to
Menardville is dotted with the negro graves,
victims of his terrible vengeance, but, of
course, this boast on the part of his friends is
an exaggeration, and I doubt his ever having
killed more than one or two from ambush....”

Appendix A: Historical Data

“Tullos B. Smith was returning late in the
evening to his home in Menard, from the
Wilkerson Ranch, about sixteen miles away,
was mounted on a large black pony, and was
leading about two other horses. As he passed a
cluster of bushes, a few miles from his
destination, Tullos B. Smith was ambushed
and killed. Late in the evening the stage going
from San Antonio to El Paso came along and
found him. Since he was not scalped, some
local citizens thought perhaps he may not
have been killed by Indians. Searching parties
soon found moccasin tracks, however, and
other Indian signs. Wm. Templeton, Lewis
Wilson and David Thorp brought Tullos B.
Smith’s body to Menard in a spring wagon.
Note: Author interviewed: J. F. P. Kruse, who
intended to [ac]company Tullos B. Smith to
the Wilkerson Ranch but was unable to find
his pony; Mr. And Mrs. Ben Ellis and Mr. and
Mrs. J. D. Carisle, who were early settlers in
that section. Dr. Landers’ notes: ‘(Bullet hole
with arrow stuck into it).’ ”

Interpretation
How much does a
researcher accept from
“lore”? If old stories tell
of graves along the
highway, could there
be any truth to this?

“When I was a boy, my daddy and I used to
come down here to the springs down here [at
the far east end of Judge Lyckman’s field]. It
flowed then somewhere about 12–1,400
gallons a minute. It was a big spring. But then
in somewhere’s about 1925 [It really sounds
like he says 1925, but he could have said
1945—makes more sense] the river
rechanneled in here. And when it rechanneled
there, why then, it took this part of the river
where the spring was off. And then every time
the river flooded, why then it washed the mud
and silt in on the spring.… It filled it in with
mud and silt and it closed it. But the springs
seep out from there at the springs all the way
down to my camp house. They come out all
along the riverbanks. And so they’re filtering
back into the river. But [at] the main spring
there, it really flowed a stream out there.”

The spring at the bend Jerry Rambo
in the river just east of
the mission site once
pumped 1,200–1,400
gallons per minute.
According to Jerry, the
river changed course in
about 1925. He

No artifacts observed on surface, but ground visibility was not good. This site was originally recorded by
Hindes, Wolf, and Hall in 1993. Although the Spanish colonial site boundaries are still applicable, the
Native American component may extend west of the original site boundary.

Prehistoric surface scatter with a light scatter of historic (modern) glass
30-40 m (E-W) x 25 m (N-S)
Few scattered burned rocks, widely scattered flakes including 2 secondary utilized flakes and tertiary
flakes (large and small, some patinated), 1 chert uniface fragment, a chert core, and mussel shell umbos
and fragments. Brown bottle glass was also observed. Artifacts were more common in the ROW on the
south side of FM 2092, but were present to the north ROW as well. Material was concentrated in eroded
areas in disturbed contexts. Some material may have been brought up to the surface when buried utility
lines were dug. All artifacts are in a surface context, possibly reaching a depth of 20 cm. No diagnostics
were found, but the age of the deposit suggests these materials are late, probably within the last 2,000
years.

Surface scatter and shallowly buried Toyah phase occupation
190 m (E-W) x 25 m (N-S)
Scattered burned rocks, chert flakes (primary, tertiary, and bifacial thinning flakes), 2 utilized flake tools, 2
blade flakes, 1 possible limestone mano, 3 pottery sherds (bone-tempered), and mussel shell umbos and
fragments. Artifacts were primarily observed in the ROW on the north side of FM 2092, but were also
present on the south. All artifacts were observed where the road cuts down into the margin of the
Pleistocene terrace. Materials appear to be eroding down the exposed road cut face, but fewer materials
were observed east of the terrace margin laying on the intact terrace surface on both the north and south
sides of FM 2092.
Results
No artifacts observed in trench. The age of the landform precludes the presence of any intact buried
cultural deposits.
