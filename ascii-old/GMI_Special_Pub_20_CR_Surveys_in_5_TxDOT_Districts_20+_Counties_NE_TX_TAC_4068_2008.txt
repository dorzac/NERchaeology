ABSTRACT

The Texas Department of Transportation is responsible for providing safe, effective, and efficient
movement of people and goods. As improvements to the system are partially funded by the
Federal Highway Administration, they are subject to the requirements of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (of 1966, as amended) and the procedures for compliance
outlined in the implementing regulations 36 CFR 800. In conformity with the provisions of 36
CFR 800.14, compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act is conducted under the First
Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA-TU) among the Federal Highways Administration, the
Texas Department of Transportation, the Texas State Historical Preservation Officer, and the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation Regarding the Implementation of Transportation
Undertakings. The Texas Department of Transportation is also subject to the Antiquities Code of
Texas and its implementing regulations 13 TAC §26. Procedures for compliance follow those
outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Texas Department of
Transportation and the Texas Historic Commission (13 TAC 26.14 and 43 TAC 2.24).
In order to partially fulfill its responsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act and the
Antiquities Code of Texas, TxDOT contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc., under TxDOT Contract #
575 xx SA010, to conduct various archeological Impact Evaluations, Surveys, and Post-Review
Discovery investigations within the Atlanta, Dallas, Lufkin, Paris, and Tyler districts. The
fieldwork was conducted between April 2006 and September 2007 under Texas Antiquities
Permit 4068. Individual interim reports were prepared for each project and appropriate
compliance procedures were followed. This final report presents a compilation of all the
individual interim reports.
Geographically, the Dallas and the Paris districts are in Northcentral Texas; and the Atlanta,
Lufkin, and Tyler districts are in Northeast Texas. The Dallas District consists of seven counties
(Dallas, Denton, Collin, Ellis, Kaufman, Navarro, and Rockwall). The Paris District covers a
nine-county area (Delta, Fannin, Franklin, Grayson, Hopkins, Hunt, Lamar, Rains, and Red
River). The Atlanta District is composed of a nine-county area (Bowie, Camp, Cass, Harrison,
Marion, Morris, Panola, Titus, and Upshur). The Lufkin District encompasses nine counties
(Angelina, Houston, Nacogdoches, Polk, Sabine, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, and
Trinity), and the Tyler District contains eight counties (Anderson, Cherokee, Gregg, Henderson,
Rusk, Smith, Van Zandt, and Wood. Most of the construction projects in these districts focused
iii

on the replacement of specific bridges and relief structures on federal and state highways, farmto-market roads, and county roads. Other projects involved road widening and construction of
new bypasses and overpasses; many of these projects included bridge replacements within their
overall scopes of work.
The current contract contained 29 work authorizations (covering 35 CSJs): 24 work
authorizations involved fieldwork, some with multiple CSJ tasks (19 surveys, three impact
evaluations, one archival review, and assessment/testing of two sites), two scopes of work
developments, and one final report production; two work authorizations were cancelled prior to
initiation of fieldwork TxDOT defines impact evaluation as the initial step in determining
whether subsequent survey of a particular area is warranted, given the anticipated impacts of the
project, the existing level of disturbance, and the likelihood of archeological deposits in good
context. Survey is defined by TxDOT as locating all archeological remains through pedestrian
surface examination, shovel testing, and subsurface mechanical trenching (where appropriate)
within the area of potential impact.
Investigations carried out under the various work authorizations dealt with 28 sites: 20
previously recorded sites within or adjacent to highway rights-of-way and eight newly recorded
sites within areas of potential effects. Of the 20 previously recorded sites, 14 sites (41AG180,
41DN445, 41DN446, 41MR99, 41SA29, 41SA218, 41SA219, 41SB72, 41TT2, 41TT8,
41TT100, 41TT101, 41TT102, and 41TT103) were not located because they had been completely
destroyed within the right-of-way, did not extend into the right-of-way, or were misplotted on
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory maps. Six of the previously recorded sites
(41COL172, 41COL173, 41DL203, 41MR64, 41MX55, and 41MX141) were revisited. Among
the 20 previously recorded sites, two (41MR64 and 41MR99) were recorded as historic remains,
three (41DN445, 41DN446, and 41MX55,) with both historic and prehistoric components, and
the remaining 15 as prehistoric. Among the eight new sites, three (41AN173, 41CE404, and
41FK121) were prehistoric, three (41AG194, 41AN162, and 41FK122) contained both historic
and prehistoric materials, and two (41CE405 and 41HU80) exhibited solely historic remains.
Six sites (previously recorded 41COL172, 41COL173, 41DL203, 41MX55; and newly recorded
41AG194 and 41AN162) were recommended for testing within the proposed project areas of
potential effects; additional archival research was suggested for site 41CE405; and TxDOT
recommended additional scraping for subsurface features at site 41AN173 after acquisition of the
land parcel. For the remaining 20 sites, no further work was considered necessary within the
areas of potential effects.
All materials collected from these investigations on state property, including photographs, notes,
forms, and artifacts, will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
University of Texas at Austin, at the conclusion of this contract.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This document constitutes the final report for work done by Geo-Marine, Inc. (Geo-Marine),
under Contract No. 575 xx SA010 (GMI Project #32110.00.29) with the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) to provide archeological services in five TxDOT districts—Atlanta,
Dallas, Lufkin, Paris, and Tyler—in Northeast and Northcentral Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The
contract began in July 2005 and will conclude in August 2008. During this time, 29 work
authorizations were issued, with the final one being issued on August 14, 2007, so that the draft
version of this report could be submitted by March 31, 2008, allowing time for review and
revisions prior to the end of the contract. Two work authorizations were cancelled prior to
initiation of any work.
Under this contract, Geo-Marine completed impact evaluations and archeological surveys to
assist TxDOT in meeting the requirements of its Memorandum of Understanding (13 TAC
26.14/43 TAC 2.24) with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and the First Amended
Programmatic Agreement (PA-TU) among the Federal Highways Administration, the Texas
Department of Transportation, the Texas State Historical Preservation Officer, and the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation Regarding the Implementation of Transportation Undertakings.
TxDOT defines impact evaluation as an onsite inspection that documents existing impacts and
other conditions that could preclude the existence of intact archeological deposits within the
proposed transportation project area. Thus, an impact evaluation is the initial field step in
determining whether subsequent survey of a particular area is warranted, given the anticipated
impacts of the project, the existing level of disturbance, and the likelihood of archeological
deposits in good context. Survey is defined by TxDOT as archeological fieldwork that locates all
archeological remains through pedestrian surface examination, shovel testing, and subsurface
mechanical trenching, where appropriate, within the area of potential impact.
The current contract contained 29 work authorizations (covering 35 CSJs): 24 involved
fieldwork, some with multiple CSJ tasks (19 surveys, three impact evaluations, one archival
review, and assessment/testing of two sites), two scopes of work developments, and one final
report production; two work authorizations were cancelled prior to initiation of fieldwork.
Fieldwork was conducted between April 2006 and September 2007.

Geographically, the five districts are in Northcentral (the Dallas and Paris districts) and Northeast
Texas (the Atlanta, Lufkin, and Tyler districts). The Dallas District is composed of seven
counties (Dallas, Denton, Collin, Ellis, Kaufman, Navarro, and Rockwall). The Paris District
covers a nine-county area (Delta, Fannin, Franklin, Grayson, Hopkins, Hunt, Lamar, Rains, and
Red River). In the geographic Northeast Texas region, the Atlanta District covers a nine-county
area (Bowie, Camp, Cass, Harrison, Marion, Morris, Panola, Titus, and Upshur). The Lufkin
District also encompasses nine counties (Angelina, Houston, Nacogdoches, Polk, Sabine, San
Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, and Trinity), and the Tyler District consists of eight counties
(Anderson, Cherokee, Gregg, Henderson, Rusk, Smith, Van Zandt, and Wood). Most of the
construction projects focused on the replacement of specific bridges and relief structures on
interstate or federal highways (IH or US) and state highways (SH), farm-to-market (FM) roads,
and county roads (CR). Other kinds of transportation activities included road widening and
extension projects and the construction of new bypasses and overpasses; many of these projects
included bridge replacements within their overall larger scopes of work.
The body of this report consists of six chapters. Following this introduction is Chapter 2, a brief
characterization of the environmental setting of the five TxDOT districts. Chapter 3 presents a
synopsis of the cultural background of the area, with separate subsections dealing with the Native
American culture history in Northeast and Northcentral Texas. A brief summary of the European
and American settlement of Texas completes this synopsis. Chapters 4 and 5 of this report
summarize the work done under this contract. The methods employed in the impact evaluations
and archeological surveys are discussed, and their effectiveness is evaluated; tables are presented
listing the impact evaluations/archeological surveys and their topographic and geologic settings,
soils, land use, and presence/absence of archeological sites; the sites investigated are described;
and the existing impacts that affect the potential of project areas to contain sites with sufficient
integrity to be eligible for National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listing or State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation are listed and discussed. Finally, the overall
recommendations concerning the impact evaluation/archeological survey results are provided in
Chapter 6. The body of the report is followed by a References Cited section and Appendix A,
Glossary of Technical Terms.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The five TxDOT districts considered in the following investigations lie within the Blackland
Prairie and Gulf Coastal Plains physiographic provinces, which together form part of the
Mesozoic-Cenozoic coastal geosyncline (Murray 1960). This geosyncline consists of a gradually
sloping basin that dips toward the Gulf of Mexico and contains formations of limestone and
sandstone deposited along the margins of an ancient receding coastline. As the Gulf of Mexico
formed during the late Cretaceous, clastic sediments and carbonates were deposited over the
worn-down Ouachita Mountains to the northwest, and along the broad marginal shelf of the gulf
basin. The Lower Cretaceous sandstones, mudstones, limestones, and marls found throughout
parts of the study area represent cycles of marine transgression and regression throughout the
period. By Upper Cretaceous times, infilling of the gulf basin and shoreline progradation
predominated as evidenced by Upper Cretaceous sandstones and mudstones throughout much of
the region. Some of the geologic formations found in these areas are the Navarro and Taylor
groups, Claiborne group, Wilcox and Midway groups, and the Catahoula Formation, along with
the ubiquitous Quaternary and Holocene alluvial sediments (Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG]
1992).
Within the five TxDOT districts under consideration in this study are six major drainage basins:
the Red River, the Sulphur River, Cypress Creek, the Sabine River, the Angelina/Neches rivers,
and the Trinity River (Figure 3). Four of these are among the 12 largest in the state of Texas.
The Red River, which flows east along the northern edge of the research area (in particular
forming the northern border of the Paris District), drains over 30,000 square miles in Texas (BEG
1996). The Sulphur River and Cypress Creek are considered part of the Red River macrodrainage. The Sabine River drains over 7,400 square miles over its 360-mile course and includes
two major reservoirs (BEG 1996). The Neches River runs for 416 miles and drains over 10,000
square miles of eastern Texas; the Angelina River is considered a tributary of the Neches, and
their confluence lies just south of the TxDOT Lufkin District (BEG 1996). Skirting the western
edge of the study area, the Trinity River Basin is 550 miles long, drains over 17,000 square miles
of land, and includes 14 major reservoirs along its three major branches (BEG 1996).
The project areas investigated under this contract contain very diverse soil characteristics. The
macro divisions of environments include upland, flood plain, and terrace deposits. The upland
deposits vary from loams and sands overlaying clays or loams to all clay deposits. These areas
5

are gently sloping to moderately steep with varying degrees of permeability and drainage. The
ground cover in upland areas usually consists of woodland or pasture grasses; many of the upland
areas have suffered from erosion due to extensive timber cutting and poor management of soils.
Most upland soils are acidic in nature with some alkaline exceptions, and the alluvial nature of
flood plains has made them highly variable in their pedological expressions. In high-energy
depositional environments, soils often consist entirely of sands, versus low-energy back swamps
containing fine clays. Large variations in deposition, including natural levees and point bars
contained in flood plains, were found in relatively small spatial areas. Ground cover in these
lowland areas varies from woodland and pasture to crops. These soils vary from poorly to
moderately well drained, and pH levels range from acidic to alkaline. Terrace deposits have
similar stratigraphy to some upland deposits, in addition to containing wind-modified deposits in
some areas. These areas are usually well drained, so much so that they often show evidence of
erosion such as gullies and deflation to the underlying geologic formations. The soils of
Northcentral and Northeast Texas are exemplified by broad diversity, and this can be a
challenging factor for archeologists to consider in their interpretations in impact evaluations and
archeological surveys (Fox 1980; Roberts 1983, 1990).
Climatically, the project areas are characterized by long hot summers and short cool winters.
Cold waves in the winter are rare and not severe, usually lasting only one or two days.
Temperatures rarely exceed 41° Celsius (C) (106° Fahrenheit [F]) in the summer or fall below 12ºC (10ºF) in the winter, but the variation is sufficient to produce four distinct seasons—a mild
winter, a warm spring, a hot summer, and a warm autumn. The number of days in the growing
season with temperatures above freezing averages between 228 and 270 (Fox 1980:2, 81; Nixon
1985:7; Roberts 1983, 1990).
Precipitation is fairly heavy throughout the year. Prolonged droughts are rare, and the frequent
afternoon thunderstorms in summer are adequate to maintain crops. Severe storms, including
tornadoes, strike the area occasionally and often cause flooding and erosion. Every few years in
the summer or fall, a tropical depression moves inland, causing extremely heavy rains for one to
three days. Average annual precipitation ranges from 89 centimeters (cm) to over 127 cm (35–50
inches [in]) and is usually distributed quite uniformly throughout the year (Nixon 1985:7).
Snowfall is variable but rare (Fox 1980:2; Roberts 1983, 1990).
The modern plant communities vary from subregion to subregion (Figure 4). The Mixed PineHardwood Forest (forests having greater than 60 percent canopy) is composed of loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda), shortleaf pine (P. echinata), overcup oak (Quercus lyrata), swamp chestnut oak
(Q. michauxii) willow oak (Q. phellos), water oak (Q. nigra), sweetgum (Liquidambar
styraciflua), and sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana) (Diamond et al. 1987). Deciduous woodlands
(woodlands having 26–60 percent canopy) of bluejack oak (Q. incana; also known as sandjack
oak) and pine and swamp communities of bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), buttonbush
(Cephalanthus occidentalis), and water elm (Planera aquatica) are also a part of the Mixed PineHardwood Forest. The Oak Woodlands (i.e., Shortleaf Pine-Post Oak-Southern Red Oak) forest
covers portions of Northeast Texas. The most common trees present within this vegetation zone
are red oak (Q. rubra), post oak, hickory, and shortleaf pine (Roberts 1983, 1990:52). Other
associated species within this vegetation zone are loblolly pine, black hickory, sandjack oak,
flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), sweetgum,
sassafras (Sassafras albidum), greenbrier (Smilax spp.), yaupon (Ilex vomitoria), wax myrtle
(Myrica cerifera), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.),
supplejack (Flagellaria indica), winged elm (Ulmus alata), beaked panicum (Panicum anceps),
7

spranglegrass (Diplachne spp.), Indiangrass, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), three-awn
(Aristida adscensionis), bushclover (Lespedeza capitata), and tickclover (Desmodium illinoense)
(McMahan et al. 1984:25). Although the Longleaf Pine Forest once covered million of acres
across the southeastern United States, few stands of the forest are extant. Most of the old-growth
forest has been logged for timber and the original forest replaced with faster-growth pine species.
However, one old-growth Longleaf Pine Forest in Texas has been set aside for preservation in the
southern part of the Lufkin District. The old-growth forest of towering longleaf pine (Pinus
palustris) has, among other species, an understory of dogwood (Cornus spp.), blackjack oak (Q.
marilandica), and pawpaw (Asimina spp.) trees, with groundcover of various tall grasses (e.g.,
bluestem [Andropogon spp.] and panicum [Panicum spp.]) and, in sandy barrens, prickly pear
(Opuntia spp.) and trailing phlox (Phlox nivalis) (Conservation Priorities for Texas 2008;
McMahan et al. 1984; NCRS 2008).
The Blackland Prairie consists of tall grasslands, primarily little bluestem (Schizachyrium
scoparium) and Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), with riparian deciduous forests of hackberry
(Celtis occidentalis), sugarberry (Celtis laevigata) and elm (Ulmus spp.) (Diamond et al. 1987).
The flora of the Eastern Cross Timbers is made up of deciduous forests of post oak (Q. stellata)
and black hickory (Carya texana), and woodlands of post oak and blackjack oak (Q.
marilandica). The Grand Prairie is a mixed-grass prairie dominated by little bluestem and
containing isolated live oak mottes and juniper (Juniperus spp.) and mesquite (Prosopis spp.)
savannas (Hayward et al. 1996). The Western Cross Timbers consists primarily of deciduous
woodlands of post oaks and blackjack oaks (Diamond et al. 1987).
In addition to the timber and wood resources of the area, acorns, nuts, berries, and grasses were
available to both prehistoric and historic-age groups. Trees bearing edible nuts identified as
being present in Northeast and Northcentral Texas include eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra),
pecan (Carya illinoinensis), shellbark hickory (C. laciniosa), shagbark hickory (C. ovata),
mockernut hickory (C. alba), black hickory (C. texana), nutmeg hickory (C. myristiciformis),
swamp hickory (C. cordiformus), pignut hickory (C. glabra), American beech (Fagus
grandifolia), Allegheny chinquapin (Castanea pumila), Ashe chinquapin (Castanea pumila
ozarkensis), white oak (Q. alba), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), and live oak (Q. virginiana)
(Heartfield and Dieste 1984a, 1984b; Vines 1977).
Faunal resources available to prehistoric and historic-age populations in Northeast and
Northcentral Texas include numerous types of invertebrates along the major streams, as well as
various species of mollusks, including both bivalves and gastropods, and crustaceans (Swanton
1946). In prehistoric and early historic times, fish resources would have included gar
(Lepisosteus spp.), crappie (Poxomis spp.), white bass (Morone spp.), black bass (Micropterus
spp.), buffalo (Ictiomus spp.), shad (Dorosoma spp.), bowfin (Amia calva), various shiners
(Notropis, Cyprinella, and Notemigonus spp.), chain pickerel (Esox niger), catfish (Ictalurus and
Pylodictus spp.), sunfish (Lepomis spp.), and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) (Blair
1950; Heartfield and Dieste 1984a, 1984b:2–6). Frogs, turtles, salamanders, and alligators
(Alligator sinensis) would have been present, as well as a wide variety of migratory birds such as
ducks, geese, and cranes (families Anatidae and Gruidae). These would have been most
numerous in the late fall and early winter, and other resident birds, such as turkeys (Meleagris
gallapavo) and mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), would have been available year-round.
Species of mammals included whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), bear (Ursus americanus),
squirrel (Sciurus spp.), rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis), and raccoon
(Procyon lotor) (Swanton 1946). Valuable fur-bearing animals would have included rabbit,
9

beaver (Castor canadensis), raccoon, weasel and mink (Mustela spp.), ringtail (Bassariscus
astutus), opossum, red fox (Vulpes vulpes), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Felis
rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), badger (Taxidea taxus), spotted skunk (Spilogale spp.), striped
skunk (Mephitis mephitis), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), and river otter (Lutra canadensis)
(Blair 1950). Several economically important species that may have once inhabited the area, such
as pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) and bison (Bison bison), are now locally extinct
(Blair 1950:100–102).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

INTRODUCTION
The following chapter is intended to provide a general background to the archeology of both
Northeast and Northcentral Texas, while supplying the interested reader with sufficient references
for a more in-depth coverage of the topic. This chapter is divided into three sections, the first of
which gives a brief summary of previous archeological research in the research areas; given the
size of the region, this section must necessarily be limited in scope. The second section briefly
discusses the nature of the prehistoric and historic-age Native American archeological records in
broad terms, and the third considers the historic-age European and American settlement in the
area.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Early archeological research in Northcentral and Northeast Texas was intermittent and of limited
scope. The earliest known investigations in Northeast Texas occurred in 1879–1880 and were
conducted by Edward Palmer of the Peabody Museum. Although his primary occupation was the
collection of plants, he also collected artifacts for the museum and wished to ascertain whether
the “Mound Builders” were to be found in East Texas. His investigation was apparently cursory,
as Palmer concluded that mound sites were not to be found in Texas (McVaugh 1956; Putnam
1880). After this, no archeology is known to have been undertaken in the northeastern portion of
Texas until early in the twentieth century, when Clarence B. Moore of the Philadelphia Academy
of Science ascended the Red River to investigate the archeology of Louisiana, Arkansas, and
Texas, publishing his findings in 1912. No excavations were undertaken in Texas, but the Cabe
Mounds site (41BW14), the E. H. Moores site (41BW2), and the A. J. Hatchel site (41BW3) were
examined (Moore 1912).
Beginning in the 1920s, more intensive and regionally based archeological investigations were
begun by J. E. Pearce, the founder of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Texas.
Early research was concentrated in Northeast Texas due to the large number of mound and burial
sites reported for this region. In 1919, Pearce was able to get funding from the Bureau of
American Ethnology (BAE) that allowed a reconnaissance into Northeast Texas. Based on the
11

examination of numerous collections, visits to sites in 14 counties, and limited test excavations,
Pearce concluded that Northeast Texas had tremendous research potential (Barnard 1939; Pearce
1924, 1931, 1932a). Funding proved to be the major constraint on Pearce’s research, as he did
not receive another major grant until 1927, when he was awarded monies from the Laura
Spelman Rockefeller Foundation of New York City (Barnard 1939). From 1920 until 1935,
Pearce and his crews conducted excavations at approximately 123 sites in Northeast Texas.
Gardner (1931), Goldschmidt (1935a, 1935b), Jackson (1933, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938), and
Pearce (1931, 1932a, 1932b) reported on some of those investigations.
Truly intensive archeological research had to wait until the Depression, when archeological
projects became one component of the Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal jobs
program. Funding under the WPA greatly exceeded anything previously seen in Texas, allowing
extensive site investigations and the accumulation of a huge regional database. Among the sites
investigated by the WPA in Northeast Texas were the Hatchel-Mitchell site complex (41BW3
and 41BW4, respectively) along the Red River (Davis 1970; Doran 1975; Dow 1987; Duffen et
al. 1940; Gilmore and McCormick 1980; Krieger 1946; Maples 1962; Suhm et al. 1954); the
George C. Davis site (41CE19) along the Neches River (Duffen et al. 1940; Ekland-Olson 1981;
Fritz 1975; Keller 1974; Newell and Krieger 1949; Shafer 1973; Spock 1977); and the Yarbrough
(41VN6) and Joslin (41VN3) sites in the Sabine River basin (Johnson 1962). Only interim
reports were published for much of that work; however, the database thus derived has provided
fertile ground for later students.
Avocational archeologists from Dallas, Texarkana, and elsewhere also began to work intensively
in the region during the 1930s (Harris 1964; Miroir n.d.). The most prominent was Dr. Clarence
H. Webb, a pediatrician from Shreveport, Louisiana. Webb’s work in northern Louisiana and
East Texas was influential in the development of the regional culture history, especially for the
Caddoan tradition (e.g., Ford and Webb 1956; Fulton and Webb 1953; Webb 1941, 1945, 1946,
1948a, 1948b, 1956, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1963, 1968; Webb and Dodd 1939, 1941; Webb and
McKinney 1975; Webb et al. 1969, 1971). Some of the sites excavated by Webb and his
associates include the Smithport Landing site (16DS4), the Belcher Mound site (16CD13), the
Gahagan Mound site (16RR1), the Mounds Plantation (16CD12), and the Resch site (41HS16).
At the same time, nonprofessionals and collectors from Dallas and Texarkana also began to
excavate into Caddoan mound and cemetery sites in extreme Northeast Texas (see, for example,
Harris 1953 and Miroir n.d.).
After World War II, there was no need for the WPA, and large-scale investigations were no
longer funded by the federal government. However, since the government was proposing the
construction of a series of reservoirs across the country, it was determined that archeological
investigations would be funded in order to salvage some of the data that would otherwise be
destroyed. The National Park Service served as the lead agency for this work, but the actual
fieldwork was undertaken by the River Basin Survey (RBS), which was formed as a part of the
Bureau of American Ethnology. Investigations undertaken at relevant lakes in North Texas by
the RBS and successor organizations included Lake O’ the Pines (Davis 1961; Davis 1958, 1970;
Davis and Gipson 1960; Davis and Golden 1960; Jelks and Tunnell 1959; Lisk 1984; Miller et al.
1951; Thurmond 1981, 1990; Tunnell 1959; Turner 1978); Wright Patman Lake (Briggs and
Malone 1970; Jelks 1961; Stephenson 1950); and Lake Tawakoni (Duffield 1961; Duffield and
Jelks 1961; Johnson 1957). Other regionally important examples include Cooper Lake (Duffield
1959; Gilmore and Hoffrichter 1964; Harris 1955; Hatzenbuehler 1953; Johnson 1962; Moorman
and Jelks 1952) along the Sulphur River; and Lake Lavon (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott
12

1975; Stephenson 1949, 1952) and Lake Ray Hubbard (Harris and Suhm 1963; Lorrain and
Hoffrichter 1968) along the East Fork of the Trinity River. Much of the excavation effort within
the upper Trinity River basin has similarly focused on reservoir development, especially along the
Elm Fork (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner et al. 1982) and
the East Fork (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross
1966).
Beginning in the late 1960s, the federal and state governments began to require consideration of
the potential environmental impacts of government-funded projects. These regulations included
assessing the impacts to archeological resources. During the last several decades, the gradual
growth of the cultural resources management (CRM) industry, composed of government
agencies, universities, and private companies, has taken place. Survey and testing were
undertaken at a number of Northcentral and Northeast Texas reservoirs during this period: Lake
Bob Sandlin (Driggers 1985; Flaigg 1982; Herrington 1979; Hsu 1969; Sullivan 1975; Thurmond
1981, 1990); Lake Fork Reservoir (Bruseth 1975; Bruseth and Perttula 1981; Bruseth et al. 1977;
Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Skiles et al. 1980; Skinner 1975a; Thurmond 1985);
Black Cypress Reservoir (Northern and Skiles 1981); Big Sandy Reservoir (Gibson 1982;
Perttula et al. 1986); and Lake Gilmer (Horizon Environmental Services, Inc., 1992; Nichols et al.
1997). In addition, further investigations were undertaken at previously inundated lakes such as
Lake O’ the Pines (Gulf South Research Institute 1974; Thurmond 1981, 1990), Wright Patman
Lake (Shiner 1982), and Caddo Lake (Campbell et al. 1983; Gibson 1969; Gulf South Research
Institute 1974; Thurmond 1981, 1990). In the late 1990s and into the 2000s, reservoir surveys
were undertaken at Toledo Bend for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE; Drake 2000),
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (Robinson 1997), and the U.S. Forest Service (Skiles
1993); at Lake Livingston (Driver 2004; Galan 2000) for private corporations; and at Lake Sam
Rayburn (Jones and Trierweiler 2005; Nichols 1995; and Trierweiler and Galan 2002) for the
USACE.
Intensive CRM studies have been undertaken at the Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant in eastern
Harrison County, near Karnack (Cliff et al. 1995; Cliff and Peter 1994b; Cliff, Peter, Largent, and
Waite 1996; Dieste et al. 1985; Peter and Stiles-Hanson 1989). Several lignite mines have also
been examined in the area, including Karnack (Heartfield, Price, and Green, Inc., 1986), Darco
(Carlson 1985; Corbin et al. 1976; Perttula and Skiles 1987; Studer 1980, 1982), and South
Hallsville (Dibble 1977; Espey Huston & Associates, Inc., 1979, 1984; Freeman 1978; Keller
1990a, 1990b, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996a, 1996b, 1998, 1999, 2000a, 2000b; LaVardera 1983a,
1983b, 1984a, 1984b, 1985; North American Consultants, Inc., 1984, 1985). More recent work in
the Caddo Lake area has focused on surveys of Harrison Bayou (Perttula and Nelson 1999), test
excavations at the Timber Hill site, a historic-age Caddo village on James Bayou (McCrocklin
1998; Parsons 1999), and intensive survey and some test excavations at Lake Bob Sandlin Park in
the Big Cypress Creek drainage (Perttula and Nelson 2002).
Two large, recent projects near Wright Patman Lake (formerly Lake Texarkana) have been
undertaken at the White Oak Creek Wildlife Management Area (WOCWMA) in Cass, Bowie,
Morris, and Titus counties, and at the Red River Army Depot and Lone Star Army Ammunition
Plant (RRAD/LSAAP) in Bowie County. The former was developed by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to mitigate the loss of wildlife habitat due to inundation of Cooper Lake farther
upstream along the Sulphur River. It consists of approximately 25,000 acres of bottomlands and
the adjacent upland margins along White Oak Creek and the Sulphur River. These investigations
began with the preparation of a research design to guide the work (Peter, Cliff, and Abbott 1990)
13

and have included surveys (Cliff 1994; Cliff and Peter 1992; Cliff, White, Hunt, Pleasant, and
Shaw 1996), site testing (Cliff and Hunt 1995; Largent et al. 1997), and data recovery (Cliff,
Green, Hunt, Shanabrook, and Peter 1996). The other project consisted of a series of studies
designed to inventory and evaluate the cultural resources present in the RRAD/LSAAP in central
Bowie County. These investigations have included surveys (Cliff and Peter 1994a; Cliff, Hunt,
Green, Peter, and Kent 1996; Gadus and Freeman 1998; Newman 1988; Peter and Cliff 1990a,
1990b), limited testing (Cliff and Peter 1988), and the preparation of a cultural resources
management plan, including an overview of Bowie County and the Great Bend in general (Peter
et al. 1991:Appendix I).
To the west of Wright Patman Lake, in Titus and Franklin counties, extensive cultural resources
investigations have been undertaken by Espey Huston & Associates, Inc. (EHA), in association
with surface coal mining projects. At the Monticello B-2 Mine, north of Mount Pleasant, 237
prehistoric and historic-age archeological sites were recorded within approximately 20,000 acres
(Jones et al. 1993). Subsequently, testing was conducted at six prehistoric sites in 1991 (Kotter et
al. 1993) and an additional 10 sites in 1993 (Nash et al. 1995). On the basis of this work, data
recovery was conducted at two sites in 1993 and 1994 (Dixon et al. 1995, 1998; Perttula 1998a;
Perttula and Nelson 1995; Perttula, Neff, Glascock, Mulholland, Nelson, Tate, Cogswell, Skokan,
and Rogers 1998). Additional site testing in 1996 resulted in data recovery at the Ear Spool site
(41TT653), a Late Caddo Titus phase farmstead (Galan 1998). Elsewhere in Titus County, a
survey of 2,716 acres at the Monticello I Area, southwest of Mount Pleasant, recorded another 22
prehistoric and historic-age sites (Hoyt et al. 1994). TxDOT projects in Titus County include
data recovery at site 41TT13 (Rogers et al. 2003) as well as survey and ongoing testing along the
proposed relief route for US 271 around Mount Pleasant.
Other recent archeological activities of importance in Northeast Texas include the 1987
excavation by the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation of a small Caddoan
hamlet and cemetery at the Murphy Branch site (41MX5) north of White Oak Creek (Brewington
and Dockall 1991; Brewington et al. 1995; Wormser 1988); data recovery at site 41BW422 along
Barkman Creek north of Hooks in Bowie County (Tucker 1994); excavations at the Oak Hill
Village site (41RK214), a large Caddo village in Rusk County (Cruse 1995; Rogers and Perttula
2004); excavations at the Rookery Ridge site (41UR133), a Late Caddo hamlet at Lake Gilmer in
Upshur County (Parsons 1998); and data recovery at the Pilgrim’s Pride site (41CP304), an
Archaic and Late Caddo Titus phase site in Camp County (Perttula 1999). Recent projects in the
immediate vicinity of Wright Patman Lake include a survey of the Beltex Lateral Pipeline in Cass
County south of the lake (Skinner 1992); small surveys conducted at Atlanta State Park for the
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (Perttula 1998b; Perttula, Prikryl, and Nelson 1997; Turpin
1994a, 1994b); a number of surveys of timber-cutting areas surrounding the lake (Burson and
Cliff 2000; Cliff and Hunt 1998; Cliff, Hunt, Pleasant, Procter, and Ensor 1996; Hunt and
Borrego 2002; Hunt and Cliff 1998a, 1998b; Linder-Linsley and Lindsay 1997, 1998; Moore et
al. 1998; White et al. 1995); and testing of five prehistoric sites at the proposed Malden Lake
Park expansion (Owens and Hunt 1999). Recent investigations at Lake O’ the Pines include
several timber-cutting-area surveys (Burson and Cliff 2000; Cliff and Hunt 1998; Hunt and
Borrego 2002; Hunt and Cliff 1998a, 1998b; Hunt et al. 1995; Linder-Linsley and Lindsay 1997,
1998; Moore et al. 1998), a survey of two proposed pump stations (Brazos Valley Research
Associates 1997), a City of Longview water pipeline (Perttula, Turner, and Nelson 1998), and
investigations by the Friends of Northeast Texas Archaeology archeologists (Perttula and Nelson
1997, 2001; Perttula et al. 1996). More recently, Geo-Marine completed an intensive pedestrian
survey of the new 51-kilometer (km; 32 mi) Lake O’ the Pines South Side Regional Water Supply
14

System that traverses parts of Gregg, Harrison, Marion, and Upshur Counties (Largent, Lintz,
Huhnke, Hunt, Allday, Salo, and Green 2004), identifying nine new archeological sites and
revisiting two previously known sites.
The delay of the construction of Cooper Lake until the 1980s contributed to a more intensive
investigation of Cooper Lake than of other reservoirs. This work was conducted in three phases:
(1) the early investigations mentioned above, (2) a return to Cooper Lake in the 1970s (Doehner
and Larson 1978; Doehner et al. 1978; Hyatt and Doehner 1975; Hyatt and Skinner 1971; Hyatt
et al. 1974), and (3) mitigation efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s (Bailey et al. 1991; Bousman
et al. 1988; Cliff 1994; Fields et al. 1991; Fields et al. 1993; Fields and Gardner 1991; Gadus et
al. 1991; Gadus, Fields, and Bousman 1992; Gadus, Fields, Bousman, and Howard 1992; Jurney
and Bohlin 1993; Jurney et al. 1993; Lebo 1988; McGregor and Roemer 1989; Moir and Jurney
1988; Moir et al. 1989; Perttula 1988a, 1988b, 1989a, 1989b; Shepard et al. 1994; Winchell et al.
1992).
In Nacogdoches County, several recent projects have been completed in the Lake Naconiche area.
An archeological survey, recording 61 prehistoric and historic sites, was undertaken for the
proposed 1,265-ac floodwater and recreational structure on Naconiche Creek for Nacogdoches
County, sponsored by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (Perttula 2000).
Subsequently, 10 prehistoric sites were selected for Phase II testing based on their research
potential (Perttula 2002). More recently, intensive survey for a gas pipeline in the area was
undertaken to determine the presence/absence of cultural resources, particularly focusing on the
area where the line crossed Naconiche Creek (Iruegas (2004). Another project in Northeast
Texas involved data recovery at the Broadway site (41SM273), situated along a tributary of the
Angelina River in Smith County (Perttula and Nelson 2004). Additionally, Perttula (2006)
completed a study of cultural materials from numerous Northeast Texas Caddo sites held in a
private collection.
In Northcentral Texas, extensive archeological investigations have been undertaken as a result of
the construction of Lewisville Lake (formerly known as Lake Dallas and Garza-Little Elm
Reservoir) and Lake Ray Roberts (formerly known as Aubrey Reservoir). Lewisville Lake has
been expanded several times as the population of the Dallas-Fort Worth area has grown; its
earliest incarnation, Lake Dallas, existed prior to 1936. Archeological investigations for
Lewisville Lake began in 1948, when archeologists from the RBS investigated the proposed
reservoir area. Twenty-seven sites were found during this survey; 14 had previously been
recorded by members of the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS; Stephenson 1949, 1950). Three
sites, Ledbetter (41DN5), Lake Dallas (41DN6), and Bob Pierce (41DN12), were tested by RBS
crews in 1951, although the results have never been reported (Prikryl 1987). During and after the
RBS investigation, members of the DAS continued to investigate the Lewisville Lake area
(Barber 1966, 1969; Harris 1950, 1951a, 1951b). The major result of this work was the discovery
and investigation of the Lewisville Lake site (41DN72), a purported pre-Clovis occupation
(Crook 1964; Crook and Harris 1956, 1957, 1958, 1961). Radiocarbon dates of 37,000 B.P. from
41DN72 created considerable controversy in the archeological community until 1979–1980,
when lowered lake levels allowed reinvestigation of the site and clarification of the dates by
archeologists from the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford 1981). Further enlargements of
Lewisville Lake prompted surveys by the Richland Archeological Society in 1973 (Nunley 1973)
and archeologists from North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas [UNT])
in 1986 (Lebo and Brown 1990). Test excavations and mitigation (Ferring and Yates 1997; Lebo
1995a) of selected sites followed. An apparently unpublished project undertaken by Southern
Methodist University archeologists in 1975 resulted in the recordation of several sites near
Lewisville Lake.
15

Archeological investigations at Lake Ray Roberts began in the early 1970s with a survey
conducted by crews from Southern Methodist University (Bousman and Verrett 1973), which
recorded 26 sites. During 1980–1981, additional survey, as well as testing and mitigation, was
undertaken by archeologists from Environmental Consultants, Inc. (ECI; Cliff et al. 1982), which
recorded 355 sites. Following the survey, additional investigations undertaken at 60 sites
(Skinner et al. 1982) were followed by intensive excavation at 12 sites, oral interviews for 17
historic-age sites, and architectural recordation at 13 sites (Skinner and Baird 1985). Finally, in
1986 UNT crews began further survey, test excavations, and mitigation efforts within the area to
be impacted by construction of Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997; Lebo 1992, 1995b,
1996; Prikryl and Yates 1987). The Aubrey Clovis site (41DN479) was discovered
serendipitously in December 1988, when excavation of a channel connecting the new Lake Ray
Roberts spillway to the Elm Fork’s natural channel produced Pleistocene faunal material in
association with Clovis artifacts (Ferring 1989). Recent investigations there have revealed
cultural deposits dated to 11,550 B.P., among the oldest known in North America (Ferring 2001).
The University of Texas at Arlington field school conducted excavations at the Northlake site on
Grapevine Creek in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975). More recent investigations at Joe Pool Lake
(Jurney et al. 1988; Peter and McGregor 1988) and the test excavations of the River Bend site,
41TR68 (Peter et al. 1987), provided the initial assemblage data necessary for an understanding
of the adaptations along the West Fork of the Trinity River. In 1991 and 1992, the Texas
Archeological Society (TAS) conducted field school excavations under the direction of staff
members of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) at several sites in the vicinity of the Sam
Kaufman/Arnold Roitsch site (41RR16) in Red River County, northwest of Wright Patman Lake
(Bruseth 1992; Bruseth et al. 1991:1, 6–9; Martin 1992; Prikryl 1992; THC 1991:11–13). This
research program included excavations at the Fasken Mounds site (41RR14), the Ray site
(41LR135), Salt Well Slough (41RR204), and the Kaufman/Roitsch site itself. Also as part of
this research effort, survey operations were conducted within the Big Pine Creek drainage to the
west, recording or rerecording 109 sites (THC 1991:13).
In addition to the above projects, innumerable projects of varying scope have also been
completed in Northcentral Texas; the following account is not exhaustive by any means. In
Collin County a survey of the Clemons Creek watershed project sponsored by the Soil
Conservation Service (SCS) was conducted in 1974 (Hughston and Lynott 1974). In Hunt
County, two projects were sponsored by the SCS at the Lake Fork Creek watershed (Ferring and
Bagot 1974; Hyatt 1974; Skinner 1975b) and Pilot Grove Creek watershed (Lynott 1974;
McCormick and Filson 1977). Investigations initiated by the Texas Water Development Board
were completed for the cities of Renner (Whitsett 1977) and McKinney (Fox 1979) in the late
1970s. A survey of a proposed pipeline route across the northern section of Collin County was
completed in 1981 for Matador Pipelines, Inc. (Peter 1981). In 1984, a survey was sponsored by
the Farmers Electric Cooperative (Skinner 1984). Previous investigations for the North Texas
Municipal Water District (NTMWD) include pedestrian survey and backhoe trenching along the
western perimeter of the federal lands adjoining Lake Lavon, which resulted in the recording of
one prehistoric site (Peter, Cliff, Hunt, and Allday 1990), while similar investigations along the
eastern edge of Lake Lavon also resulted in the recording of one prehistoric site (Hunt et al.
1991). Martin (1988) conducted a survey of proposed highway improvements along IH-35W in
Denton and Tarrant counties. In 1989, UNT crews surveyed Hickory Creek Park for the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, resulting in the location of one historic-age site (Lebo and Brown
1989). In 1991, Mariah Associates, Inc. undertook a reconnaissance of proposed sewer line
improvements for the city of Argyle (Kibler 1991). During late 1991, Austin and Peter (1992)
16

performed a pedestrian survey of proposed improvements at North Lake Park in the city of
Denton. Corbin (1992) surveyed the proposed Northpointe Park for the city of The Colony.
Investigations concerning the expansion of the city of McKinney solid waste landfill (Hunt et al.
1992) and a proposed water pump station (Hunt 1993) have also been conducted for the
NTMWD.
During 1993, AR Consultants surveyed the proposed 28-acre Highland Village Community Park
(Skinner 1993). In the same year, Peter and Green (1993) surveyed the proposed South Lakes
Park for the city of Denton. In 1994, Geo-Marine conducted a survey of the proposed State
Highway (SH) 190 project area, identifying one new historic-age site (41DL366) and revisiting
several others (Hunt and Peter 1997). Ferring (1995) undertook a survey of 125 acres adjacent to
the Lewisville Lake dam. SWCA, Inc., conducted a pedestrian survey of approximately 8 acres
belonging to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers near Grapevine Lake (Miller 1995). Also in
1995, the University of Texas at Austin conducted a survey of an 800-acre tract along Timber
Creek (Carpenter 1995). During late 1994 and early 1995, Hicks & Company performed a
pedestrian survey for a 160-acre expansion of the city of Denton landfill (Treece et al. 1995). A
1996 pedestrian survey of the Arbor Hills Nature Preserve by AR Consultants resulted in the
location of one historic-age site (Skinner and Whorton 1996). Again in 1996, AR Consultants
surveyed the Prairie Creek Interceptor for the city of Lewisville (Trask et al. 1996). In the winter
of 1996–1997, AR Consultants surveyed the proposed FM 2499 at Lewisville Lake (Skinner
1997). Early in 1997, Espey Huston & Associates, Inc., undertook survey of the Kirkwood
Branch Interceptor for the Trinity River Authority (Tate 1997). In 1998, AR Consultants
conducted excavations at the Chinn Chapel Cemetery Log Cabin, which, like the associated
Chinn Chapel and Chinn Chapel Cemetery (both of which are commemorated with State Historic
markers), is located near Copper Canyon (Skinner 1998). In 1999, Geo-Marine conducted further
investigations along the route of the proposed President George Bush Turnpike (SH 190),
locating two previously recorded sites (41DL240 and 41DL321) as well as a short-term
prehistoric habitation site, 41DL391, whose data potential was exhausted through test excavations
(Peter et al. 2001, 2002).
The next year, a survey of a 109-acre reclamation area in the SH 190 corridor identified a
historic-age home site, 41DN394, just west of IH 35 (Hunt 2000); this site was determined to be
ineligible. The same year, AR Consultants identified sites 41DN510 and 41DN513, two historicage wells, in the proposed location of the planned community of Lantana (near Bartonville); the
report apparently remains unpublished. In 2001, Geo-Marine conducted archeological and
geoarcheological investigations of 15 acres along Timber Creek in Lewisville, identifying two
prehistoric sites considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Cooper et al. 2001). Site
41DN518, a historic-age farmstead, was reported by Galan in 2001. In 2002, Geo-Marine
conducted a survey of the proposed location for a new wastewater treatment facility at Panther
Creek, resulting in the identification of two historic-age sites (41DN519 and 41DN520); neither
was recommended for inclusion in the NRHP (Tiné 2002). In late 2002, the area immediately
northeast of the IH 35 crossing of the Elm Fork in Denton County was surveyed and subjected to
geoarcheological investigations by Geo-Marine, in preparation for the proposed T. C. Rice, Jr.,
Athletic Complex; no cultural materials were identified, with the exception of two small historicage localities (Hunt et al. 2002). In 2003, Geo-Marine conducted a survey of 19.89 linear km
(11.93 mi) of pipeline corridor located south of Denton. This survey, which crossed Hickory
Creek in numerous places, identified one prehistoric site and one historic-age locality. An Ellistype projectile point was recovered from the prehistoric site, which was located in a disturbed
context on an oil drill pad (Huhnke et al. 2003). Geo-Marine also surveyed a 20.3-km (12.2 mi)
17

segment of US Highway 380 from the Denton/Wise county line to its intersection at IH 35
(Huhnke 2004). In February of 2004, Geo-Marine surveyed a 51.5-km (32.2 mi) segment of IH
35 from IH 635 to US 380 in Denton, resulting in the identification of three ineligible historic-age
sites (Largent, Huhnke, and Wurtz 2004). Later that year, Geo-Marine surveyed a 220-ac parcel
on the northeast corner of the intersection of IH 35 and the SH 121 bypass, locating the remains
of two previously recorded sites as well as one large, deeply buried Archaic site, 41DN529
(Largent, Lintz, and Huhnke 2004).
Forty work authorizations were completed by Geo-Marine, Inc., for TxDOT contract #574 xx
SA004 between 2004 and 2006 for the Atlanta, Dallas, Lufkin, Paris, and Tyler districts. Many
of these work authorizations consisted of multiple tasks for a total of 181 impact evaluations and
75 archeological surveys. This work resulted in the investigation of 37 archeological sites; eight
of the sites were identified and 29 were not located because they were completely destroyed in
the right-of-way (ROW), did not originally extend into the ROW or were misplotted on the Texas
Sites Atlas (Phillips et al. 2007). In addition to the work conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc.,
numerous surveys have been conducted in the Atlanta, Dallas, Lufkin, Paris, and Tyler Districts.
These surveys range in size from less than an acre to more than 1,000 acres, resulting in the
investigation of well over 100 sites (THC 2007).

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
The following brief discussion of the prehistoric archeological record of Northeast Texas draws
from previous summaries by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993), Perttula (1988a), Story (1981, 1985,
1990), and Thurmond (1985, 1988, 1990). Similarly, discussion of the archeology of
Northcentral Texas (especially for the upper Trinity River basin) derives from four major reports
by Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1987, 1990), and Yates and Ferring (1986). Although
the cultural sequences are similar, they are by no means identical, especially for Northeast Texas.
Indeed, due to what appears to be increasing regional differentiation through time, the cultural
sequences for the Great Bend Region (including Wright Patman Lake) and the western Cypress
Creek basin (including Lake O’ the Pines) diverge in the Caddoan period. The generalized
cultural sequences for the Northcentral and Northeast Texas culture areas (Figure 5) are presented
in Table 1, and presented separately in the subsequent discussions.

Northeast Texas
This discussion applies to the Atlanta, Tyler, and Lufkin districts of TxDOT; the Dallas and Paris
districts are presented in the Northcentral Texas discussion. As indicated in Table 1, the Native
American cultural sequence for Northcentral Texas is quite different from that of Northeast
Texas. The only period of overlap appears to be the Paleo-Indian period, which occurred before
significant regional differentiation took place at the end of the Pleistocene; thus, the Paleo-Indian
discussion is equally applicable to Northeast and Northcentral Texas. Both periods experienced a
lengthy Archaic period as well, but it lasted much longer in Northcentral Texas than in Northeast
Texas, and the recognized cultures are not entirely the same.

Paleo-Indian Period
Although a pre-Clovis occupation of the New World had long been suggested (Adovasio et al.
1990; Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990; McGahey n.d.;
Meltzer 1989), it was not until the excavations at the Monte Verde site in Chile that the evidence
for a pre-12,000 B.P. occupation has been widely accepted. Within the southeastern United
States, however, the evidence for a pre-Clovis occupation remains disputed, and thus the PaleoIndian period remains the earliest recognized human occupation in Texas.
The Paleo-Indian period across the entire North Texas region (ca. 9500–7000 B.C.) generally
includes those remains of human presence that can be dated to the very late Pleistocene and the
immediate post-Pleistocene periods (for recent reviews of this period in North Texas, see Johnson
1989; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). As a matter of convenience, the period can
be subdivided into an early Paleo-Indian period (ca. 9500–8500 B.C.) and a late Paleo-Indian
period (8500–7000 B.C.).

20

In Northeast Texas, numerous diagnostic projectile points, such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Scottsbluff, and San Patrice, have been recovered as isolated surface finds or excavated in later
contexts (Carley n.d.; Perttula 1988a:17), but unfortunately, few Paleo-Indian sites in good
stratigraphic context have been found (Perttula 1988a:17; Preston 1972, 1974), and fewer have
received any sort of systematic excavation. Both Perttula and Story note the possible presence of
horizontally stratified early Paleo-Indian deposits at the Forrest Murphey site (41MR62) at Lake
O’ the Pines, but the site was reportedly destroyed by dam construction before being excavated
(Perttula 1988a:17; Perttula et al. 1986:47; Story 1990:184–185). The situation of the Murphey
site and the discovery of the deeply buried Clovis-aged Aubrey site (41DN479) along the Elm
Fork of the Trinity River in Northcentral Texas (Ferring 1989, 1990, 2001) suggest that wellpreserved Paleo-Indian sites in Northeast Texas will only be found by examining deeply stratified
Pleistocene terraces or by penetrating more recent Holocene alluvium in modern flood plains.
Despite the lack of good data relating to the early Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas, some
attempts have been made to generalize regarding settlement mobility and intensity of site
occupation, drawing on the limited data that is known and on assumptions based on comparisons
with other areas. For instance, a number of researchers have seen evidence for a high degree of
group mobility in the broad distribution of Paleo-Indian artifacts over the landscape and in the
variety of presumably nonlocal lithic raw materials from which they were made (Meltzer and
Smith 1986; Shafer 1977; Story 1990:177). Likewise, the well-documented exploitation of large
megafauna by Paleo-Indians in the western United States, coupled with the known presence of
similar species in Northeast Texas between 11,000 and 9,000 years ago (see Hemmings 1983;
Slaughter and Hoover 1963), has resulted in the popular conclusion that “big game hunting” was
part of the Paleo-Indian subsistence strategy in Northeast Texas. Although a possible association
between a Clovis point and mastodon remains at the Murphey site (Story 1990:185) does support
this likelihood, increasing evidence from sites to the west (such as the Aubrey site) suggests that
Paleo-Indian groups were less dependent upon “big game hunting” than has been assumed in the
past.
The late Paleo-Indian period in Northeast Texas appears to be distinguished by the divergence of
the earlier, widespread fluted point tradition into several distinct subtraditions. The first of these
includes Scottsbluff, Plainview, and similar lanceolate points that appear to be part of a more
western or “plains-derived” subtradition in terms of origin and style; the second includes Dalton
and Dalton-related projectile points that have a wide distribution throughout the wooded
southeastern and midwestern United States. Some researchers have suggested that this Dalton
horizon represents an adaptation to the changing environment at the end of the Pleistocene
(Goodyear 1982:389–391), a view that has found some support in the addition of the Dalton adze,
a presumed “heavy, woodworking tool,” to what otherwise is viewed as a Paleo-Indian tool kit
(Kelley et al. 1988:21). San Patrice, an important complex that may be related to Dalton, is found
in eastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, and southern Arkansas and is
characterized by San Patrice points, Keithville points, and Albany scrapers (Ensor 1987;
Schambach 1979; Webb et al. 1971).

Archaic Period
With the end of the Ice Age, the prehistoric residents of the region began to develop into localized
populations of efficient hunter-gatherers, exploiting localized resource bases. This period, and
the subsistence pattern that characterizes it, has become known as the Archaic. The Archaic
21

represents a long period of time that was characterized by only gradual and minor changes in
subsistence patterns, lithic technology, and projectile point styles and was apparently a period of
strong cultural stability. Archaic populations are usually portrayed as generalized hunters and
gatherers with more limited geographic ranges than the preceding Paleo-Indian peoples. At the
present time, there is no evidence for the development of local cultigens during the Archaic
period in Texas, although this is not the case for the Ozark Highlands and other parts of the
eastern United States.
The Archaic period in Northeast Texas is tentatively dated between 7000 and 200 B.C. As is true
for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of early, middle, and late
subperiods, has been applied in Northeast Texas. Although reliable dating for the Archaic period
in this area of Texas is virtually nonexistent, these divisions have been given tentative dates on
the basis of better-dated sites in surrounding areas. Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from
7000 to 4000 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4000 to 2000 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 2000
to 200 B.C. (overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas include Fields and Tomka
1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1985, 1990). Archaic remains are usually found in
upland settings and are frequently mixed with later material (Campbell et al. 1983; Story 1981).
General trends that have been proposed as characterizing the Archaic period in Northeast Texas
include an increasingly complex settlement system, increasing population size and density,
increasing sedentism, and the development of distinct group territories (Perttula 1988a:17; Story
1985:52). Despite these changes, however, no evidence of any level of food production (even
incipient production) has been reported from any Northeast Texas Archaic site (Perttula
1988a:17; Story 1990:Table 56), in spite of the fact that definite steps toward food production
were being taken elsewhere in the eastern United States (Ford 1985:347–349; Watson 1988).
During the Early Archaic (ca. 7000–4000 B.C.), the occurrence of small and widely distributed
sites has been suggested to reflect high group mobility within large and poorly defined territories,
based on a generalized hunting and gathering economy (Meltzer and Smith 1986; Story 1985:35,
39). Projectile point forms that may be associated with the Early Archaic in Northeast Texas
include Kirk, Keithville, Palmer, Cossatot, Dawson, and Wells (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).
In comparison to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period (4000–2000 B.C.) appears to be
characterized by (1) an increased diversity of tool types; (2) greater interregional variability; (3)
the addition of ground, pecked, and polished stone tools; and (4) an increased use of plant foods,
as indicated by the addition of mortars, pestles, and milling stones (Neuman 1984:77, 79). The
dependence upon abundant forest resources (e.g., oak mast production, deer, and small mammals)
that are evenly distributed over most of the region probably resulted in evenly distributed
population densities and favored the development of exclusive or “fixed” territories (Plog and
Upham 1983:202; Story 1985:41). Although grinding stones apparently were introduced during
the Early Archaic period, it was not until the Middle Archaic that their use became widespread.
Grinding and polishing were used to produce grooved axes, atlatl weights, and ground stone
pendants during this period. Diagnostic dart points that may be associated with the Middle
Archaic include Big Sandy, Calf Creek, Johnson, Carrollton, Morrill, Evans, Lone Oak, Trinity,
and Wesley (Story 1990; Thurmond 1990).
Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period in Northeast Texas
(ca. 2000–200 B.C.) as evidenced by an apparent increase in the number of sites, a greater
distribution of sites over the landscape, and evidence of increasing degrees of sedentism. At the
same time, group mobility may have become more limited and interregional contact may have
22

become much more common. If the greater spatial dispersal of sites is not a result of sampling
error due to unequal destruction or burial of earlier sites, it may reflect an economic system with
increasing reliance on all available floral and faunal resources, although the economic data to
support this view are generally absent. Throughout Northeast Texas, Late Archaic period sites
are relatively common in the uplands, and a number are known from the flood plain of the Red
River as well as Late Archaic components in sites to the south near Lake Sam Rayburn in the
Neches/Angelina river area (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993), but no regional phases have yet been
identified (Schambach 1982a:3–6). Dart points that may be diagnostic of the Late Archaic
include Lange, Castroville, Ellis, Palmillas, Edgewood, Yarbrough, Ensor, and Kent (Story 1990;
Thurmond 1990).

Early Ceramic Period
The Early Ceramic period (200 B.C.–A.D. 800) in Northeast Texas is generally not well defined
and is largely identified by similarities in pottery and projectile points to sites of the Fourche
Maline tradition north of the Red River (recent overviews that provide good information for this
period include Perttula et al. 1993; Peter et al. 1991:Appendix I; and Story 1990). Diagnostic
artifacts consist of coarse plainware ceramics, tempered with either clay/grog or bone, and Gary
projectile points. The ceramics generally are grouped together as Williams Plain; but given the
wide range of temporal and spatial variability present, they should probably be viewed as one or
more undefined varieties of that type. Discounting ceramic differences at the varietal level, the
remains of the Early Ceramic period in Northeast Texas seem to be most closely related to
Schambach’s (1982b:188, 1998) Fourche Maline tradition in Arkansas. Despite other similarities
to Fourche Maline, however, no Early Ceramic period burial mounds are known in the Texas
portion of the Great Bend. The few that are known in East Texas occur to the south in the Sabine
and Neches river basins around the Toledo Bend and Sam Rayburn reservoir areas (see Story
1990:Figure 41) at the Coral Snake (16SA48; on the eastern edge of Toledo Bend in Louisiana)
and Jonas Short (41SA101) mound sites (Jensen 1968; McClurkan et al. 1966, 1980). The lack of
such evidence in Northeast Texas leaves open the question of whether or not this area was
undergoing the same processes of cultural evolution presumably responsible for the development
of burial mound use elsewhere (see Perttula 1988a:18; Story 1990).
Perttula (1988a:18) has noted what appears to be a major presence of Early Ceramic period
occupation within the Sulphur River basin, although this may be more the result of intensity of
research or factors of site preservation rather than the actual presence of a large Early Ceramic
population. In regard to modeling settlement patterns during this period, Perttula (1988a:18)
suggests that “Early Ceramic or Fourche Maline settlements are . . . represented by villages and
hamlets in the flood plains or terraces of larger streams, and by smaller components in the
uplands.” Many of the sites on which Perttula bases this model, including Snipes at Wright
Patman Lake (Jelks 1961) and Tick, Thomas, Hurricane Hill, and Lawson at Cooper Lake
(Doehner and Larson 1978; Martin 1996a, 1996b; Perttula 1990), contain middens that are taken
as indicating a more sedentary settlement pattern than that of the preceding Archaic period. Two
apparent pits (Features 1 and 2) radiocarbon dated to the Early Ceramic period (1,460 ± 60 B.P.
and 2,090 ± 30 B.P., respectively) at 41HP137 at Cooper Lake yielded hickory nut, acorn, wild
tubers (possibly the prairie turnip, Pediomelum or Psoralea sp.), and what may be fragments of
cultivated squash or gourd (Fields et al. 1994:12; McGregor 1996:357).

23

Elsewhere in Northeast Texas, sandy paste ceramics (cf., Bear Creek Plain and Goose Creek
Plain) appear to be common on Early Ceramic period sites south of the Sabine River (Story
1981:146) along the upper reaches of the Angelina and Neches rivers, as well as farther south in
the Sam Rayburn and Toledo Bend reservoir areas. This pottery is technologically different from
the ceramics in the northern area of Northeast Texas. Many of the sites south of the Sabine (e.g.,
Deshazo [41NA27] and George C. Davis [41CE19], as well as Wolfshead [41SA117], Runnells 1
and 2 [41SA87 and SA86], and Dubose [41SA100] in the Sam Rayburn Reservoir area) exhibit
ceramics attributed to the Mossy Grove tradition (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:262, 233; Story
1990:277]). The indigenous Mossy Grove hunter-gatherer population was likely pushed
southward by Caddo groups at the end of the period (ca. A.D. 800/900) (Story 1990:256). Lithics
from these more southerly sites are predominantly the Kent and Gary dart point styles, along with
“rather nondescript bifaces . . . [that may represent] projectile point manufacture failures” and
some unifaces (Story 1990:256). Toward the middle–late Early Ceramic period (ca. A.D. 500–
600), the bow and arrow technology, along with the Friley arrow point, likely was introduced into
the southeastern Texas region (Story 1990:256).

Caddo Period in the Great Bend-Neches/Angelina Regions
The Formative (A.D. 800–1000) and Early Caddo (A.D. 1000–1200) periods in the Great BendNeches/Angelina regions are not well defined. Ceramics for both of these periods include
Hickory Fine Engraved, Carmel Engraved, Crockett Curvilinear Incised, and Pennington
Punctated-Incised (Thurmond 1990:Table 8). Thurmond has further distinguished between
equivalents of these two periods on the basis of the presence of Davis Incised, Holly Fine
Engraved, Kiam Incised, Spiro Engraved, and Weches Fingernail Impressed in the earlier (along
with some late varieties of Coles Creek types), and of Canton Incised, Haley Engraved, Maxey
Noded Redware, Sanders Engraved, and Sanders Plain in the later, although some researchers are
more inclined to put the latter four types in the Middle Caddoan period.
The Formative and Early Caddoan periods are characterized by what may best be termed the Alto
complex or Alto sphere, a widespread manifestation related to the Alto phase, originally defined
at the George C. Davis site in Cherokee County, Texas, south of the Great Bend area (Newell and
Krieger 1949). The Alto complex shows strong influence from Coles Creek to the east and
appears to partially overlap it in time. It also, however, shows a number of new characteristics
(Neuman 1970), including new projectile point types (i.e., Hayes and Homan arrow points), new
ceramic vessel forms (i.e., the carinated bowl and the bottle), and a new mode of vessel
decoration (i.e., fine engraving with red pigment filler).
Perttula (1988a:18) has suggested that these and other cultural innovations, including the
introduction of the bow and arrow ca. A.D. 800 and increased food production based on maize, led
to increases in population and sociopolitical complexity during these periods. The settlement
system became increasingly complex, apparently involving sedentary villages and farmsteads,
special function sites (what Binford [1980] has called logistical camps), and mound centers that
were presumably ritual or ceremonial in function (see Perttula 1988a:18–19). A number of such
mound centers dating to the Formative and Early Caddo periods occur in Northeast Texas,
including the T. M. Coles or Mustang Creek Mound (Jackson 1931) on a tributary of the Sulphur
River to the west of Wright Patman Lake, and several mounds at the lake itself (Stephenson
1950). Many more mound sites occur along the Red River and its immediate tributaries to the
north (Banks 1983; Miller 1986; Taylor 1949). To the south, the Bivins-Flanagan mound (also
24

known as Hudnall-Pirtle; 41RK4) on the middle Sabine River is a major multiple mound site with
six to eight mounds, a plaza, and a habitation area (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:129). The
George C. Davis site in Cherokee County on the Neches River may be the best representative of
the mound center-village site type, another characteristic of the Alto focus. The Early Caddoan
component of this site likely indicates an emigrant group from the middle Sabine River area
(possibly Bivins-Flanagan?) arriving prior to ca. A.D. 900 (Story 1990:325).
The Middle Caddo period (A.D. 1200–1400) in the Great Bend region includes what is known as
the Haley phase, the definition of which is based generally on mortuary data, largely from C. B.
Moore’s excavations at the Haley site (3MI1) in Arkansas (Moore 1912). The Haley phase
appears to represent a development out of the earlier Alto complex, and among the continuities
from the earlier period is the use of shaft grave burials for some members of the society, who
were accompanied into the afterlife by relatively rich grave offerings (Kelley et al. 1988:26).
This phase was centered in the Great Bend area in Arkansas, but northwestern Louisiana and
northeastern Texas also fall within its peripheral influence. A Haley phase component has been
recognized at the Hatchel site in Bowie County (Davis 1970:44), and other Haley components are
known in the area, including the Cabe Mounds site (Perttula et al. 1995) and the Mitchell site
(Cliff et al. 1997). Coker Mound (41CS1) also apparently has a Haley phase component, based
on radiocarbon dates and a reported Haley Engraved bottle in a mortuary feature (Perttula,
Turner, and Nelson 1997:17–20). Despite its presence in Texas, however, the Haley phase was
apparently most fully elaborated in the Arkansas portion of the Great Bend.
Most of the well-known Haley phase components, especially in Arkansas, relate to mound
centers, although it is unclear whether all of them were associated with villages (Wyckoff 1974).
One well-investigated nonmound habitation site is known from Arkansas, apparently a small
farmstead located on “a natural levee” or “high ground overlooking riverine bottom lands”
(Wyckoff 1974:106, 113). The site contained two circular house structures and a small trash
dump and has suggested to some that the Haley phase settlement pattern involved small,
dispersed farmsteads surrounding vacant ceremonial centers (Hoffman 1970). Wyckoff
(1974:107) also notes, however, the existence of mound centers with “potentially large villages,”
as well as nonmound cemeteries located close to mound centers. Finally, he states that:
[t]here is certainly an overall tendency for the Haley components, mound centers and non-mound
habitation areas alike, to associate with a riverine valley setting. Most of the mound centers did occur
in the valleys of major streams, but [some mound centers] were on the flood plains of streams tributary
to the major rivers [Wyckoff 1974:112].

In regard to sociopolitical organization within Haley phase society, the complexity of the
mortuary ceremonialism and apparent status ranking evident in the burials recovered from Haley
phase sites, as well as the presumed organizational control necessary to construct the mound
centers, strongly suggest that there was “a political and religious hierarchy that operated
throughout the Haley Focus [sic] society” (Wyckoff 1974:110).
In the Sabine River area, the Oak Hill Village site (41RK214) in Rusk County (Rogers and
Perttula 2004), Washington Square (41NA49) in Nacogdoches County, Tyson (41SY92) in the
Attoyac River basin in Shelby County are among the major mound centers dating to the EarlyMiddle Caddo period (Perttula 2000:24–25). Data from these sites suggest a horticultural
lifestyle based on maize and squash, supplemented by wild seeds, nuts, and tubers, along with
fishing and continued hunting of deer and other game. Mounds were used both as temple and
25

burial sites, and the larger centers were important civie-ceremonal areas. Many of the large
mound centers contained structures and plazas along with storage/granery structures and pits.
The distribution of the mound centers suggests an integrated society of rather complex sociopolitical extent. The Washington Square mound, securely dated to A.D. 1268 and 1302, was built
at the crossroads between aboriginal trails (later known as the east-west Caddo Trace and the
north-south Camino Real) and may have been primarily a ceremonial center since little indication
of permanent habitation has been documented. Radiocarbon dates also suggest the possibility
that Washington Square was the successor to George C. Davis, which was essentially abandoned
by the early fourteenth century (Perttula 2000:24–29).
Material culture reflects corner-notched and rectangular-stemmed arrow points, celts, Gahagan
bifaces, scrapers, and borer/perforators, as well as ceramic pipes, earspools, and figurines. The
decorated carinated, boat-shaped, cylindrical, and globular bowls and jars; bottles; plates and
platters; and ollas ceramics, however, are the most distinctive cultural items. These ceramics
were used for various food-related tasks—cooking, serving, storage—as well as for use as
personal items and ceremonial beakers in mortuary occasions (Perttula 2000:26–27).
The Late Caddo period (A.D. 1400–1680) includes the final part of the prehistoric period and the
initial years of European contact (for an overview of this period and the subsequent Historic
Caddo period, see Perttula 1992). The survivors of the de Soto entrada apparently entered
Northeast Texas about midway through the Late Caddo period, the latter part of which appears to
have overlapped with the initial movements of seventeenth-century European explorers and
traders into northeastern Texas.
In the lower Sulphur River basin, two archeological complexes have been defined for the Late
Caddo period, the Titus phase and the Texarkana phase (Schambach 1982a; Thurmond 1985).
The Titus phase appears to be centered between the Sabine and Sulphur rivers in the Northeast
Texas piney woods and post-oak savanna. The Texarkana phase is located in the upper portion of
the Great Bend of the Red River and extends southward to include a portion of the lower Sulphur
River drainage (Wyckoff 1974:Figure 4). The definition of the Texarkana phase is based largely
on WPA excavations conducted at the Hatchel mound and at the Mitchell and Moores cemeteries
situated on the Red River northwest of Texarkana (Davis 1970:50–51). Texarkana phase sites,
such as Sherwin on the lower Sulphur River, probably existed as satellites to these larger,
permanent settlements on the Red River (Perttula 1988a).
Both the Titus and Texarkana phases appear to be characterized by small hamlets or farmsteads
that were probably occupied by small family groups of shifting agriculturalists. These farmsteads
were apparently characterized by a limited number of structures and a small family cemetery (see
Brewington and Dockall 1991; Brewington et al. 1995; Jelks 1961; Perttula 1988a; and Wormser
1988). They presumably were associated with larger, more permanent suprahousehold sites,
including both mound centers and nonmound cemeteries, which served to integrate the scattered
households into a unified social group.
In the Neches/Angelina river basin, the Frankston (A.D. 1400–1650) and Angelina (post-A.D.
1450/1500) phases are dominant. In this area, there is a noticeable lack of Late Caddo large
mound burials after ca. A.D. 1400. Additionally, the lack of elaborate burials, especially as
indicated at the George C. Davis site, may indicate a decline in organizational hierarchy (Story
1990:340). The Frankston phase A. C. Saunders site (41AN19) near the Neches River in
Anderson County is the only known mound site. Frankston phase habitation sites consist
26

primarily of farmsteads, hamlets, and small villages (Perttula 2000:31) and many cluster along
the upper Neches River (Anderson 1972:163). Burials tend to be in small (possibly) family or
village cemeteries of less than 10 individuals, with many interments containing ceramic grave
goods. To the south near Sam Rayburn Reservoir, the Angelina focus sites yielded ceramic
elbow pipes, and brushed and punctated ceramics. Perdiz arrow points, conch shell beads, bone
tools, and worked bone artifacts have been recovered from burials at the Walter Bell site
(41SB50) in Sabine County (Jelks 1965:56–60). In the Toledo Bend Reservoir area in Sabine and
Shelby counties, Late Caddo residential settlements exhibit extensive middens and small
cemeteries that were contemporaneous with Angelina phase sites to the west (Perttula 2000:32).

Caddo Period in the Big Cypress Creek Basin
The time span between the Archaic and the Caddo period (i.e., the Early Ceramic from ca. A.D.
200–800) in the Cypress Creek basin is poorly represented, but Caddo habitation of the period
subsequent to ca. A.D. 800 is well documented. The Caddo period in the Cypress Creek basin has
been subdivided into early, middle, and late subperiods: the Early Caddo from ca. A.D. 800 to
1300, the Middle Caddo from ca. A.D. 1300 to 1400, and the Late Caddo from A.D. 1400 to 1600
(see Thurmond 1990:39–40). Thurmond’s (1990) Early Caddo period includes components
related to the Alto and Sanders foci and is subdivided into two parts. Ceramic types characteristic
of Period 1 (A.D. 800–1100) include Holly Fine Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Spiro
Engraved, Kiam Incised, Weches Fingernail Impressed, and Coles Creek Incised; Williams Plain
ceramics also are found. During Period 2 (A.D. 1100–1300), ceramic types shift to Sanders
Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Sanders Plain, and Canton Incised; Williams Plain makes up a
smaller part of the assemblage than previously. Arrow points for the Early Caddo period as a
whole include Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, and Scallorn (Thurmond 1990:226–227).
The Middle Caddo period in the western Cypress Creek basin is seen as being transitional from
the Early Caddo Period 2 to the Late Caddo Whelan phase. Thurmond identifies only 14 sites for
this period, all of which are found in the upper reaches of Big Cypress Creek. Ceramic types
identified for this period include Ripley Engraved, Avery Engraved, Canton Incised, Maydelle
Incised, Bullard Brushed, Pease Brushed-Incised, and La Rue Neck-Banded. Projectile point
types found during this period are Bonham, Catahoula, Alba, Perdiz, and Clifton (Thurmond
1990:227–228).
The eastern and western portions of the Cypress Creek basin show distinct differences in material
culture during the Late Caddoan period, with a dividing line close to the western end of Caddo
Lake. In the eastern side of the basin, the Late Caddoan period includes the Bossier and Belcher
phases, while in the western side of the basin are the Whelan (A.D. 1350–1430) and Titus (A.D.
1430–1680) phases. Thurmond (1990) labels the western group the Cypress cluster. He believes
this represents the formation of a distinct social group, equivalent to the Kadohadacho and
Hasinai confederacies known ethnographically (Thurmond 1985).
The Whelan phase is the earlier temporal phase identified for the Cypress cluster. Engraved
ceramics from Whelan phase sites consist primarily of Ripley Engraved, with smaller amounts of
Taylor Engraved and Wilder Engraved. Motifs observed on Ripley Engraved ceramics include
the scroll, scroll and circle, alternating nested triangle, horizontal diamond, and bisected diamond,
with the border elements usually being filled with curvilinear hatchures. Utility wares from this
period are significantly different from Early Caddo utility wares. Body sherds are about equally
27

divided between brushed and plain ceramics, while other treatments, such as incising, punctation,
fingernail-impressed, and red-filming, become minor parts of the assemblage. Brushed ceramics
are about equally divided between Bullard Brushed and Pease Brushed-Incised; plain-bodied
vessels are primarily classified as Maydelle Incised, and La Rue Neck-Banded pottery is
uncommon. Arrow points typical of this period are Perdiz and Scallorn (Thurmond 1990:228).
The succeeding Titus phase represents the final prehistoric occupation of the upper Cypress
Creek basin. The engraved ceramics are still dominated by Ripley Engraved, although Taylor
Engraved and Wilder Engraved are more common than in the Whelan phase, and two new types,
Bailey Engraved and Johns Engraved, appear. A new motif for Ripley Engraved, the pendant
triangle, appears to be limited to this phase. Border elements change from the curvilinear
hatchures of the Whelan phase to broad, deeply excised areas. Specialized ceramics, such as
Killough Pinched jars, zoomorphic effigy bowls, and noded rattle bowls, become more common
during the Titus phase. Utility wares also underwent a great deal of change from the preceding
period. Brushed ceramics are reduced in frequency compared to the Whelan phase, and a new
decorative element, appliqué, is introduced. Pease Brushed-Incised virtually disappears from the
assemblage, while Maydelle Incised is found in slightly reduced frequencies as compared to the
Whelan phase, and La Rue Neck-Banded remains constant. Two new types, Harleton Appliqué
and a type similar to McKinney Plain, are introduced during this period. Extensive trade contacts
with the McCurtain phase to the north are indicated by the occurrence of Avery Engraved, Bowie
Engraved, Cass Appliqué, and Simms Engraved ceramics at Titus phase sites. Similar contacts
with the Belcher phase to the east appear to be limited to the adjacent sites of the Titus phase.
Perdiz and Scallorn arrow points continue into the Titus phase and Bassett, Maud, Reed, and
Talco points are introduced (Thurmond 1990:228–229).
Thurmond (1990:229–233) has defined four regional subclusters within the Titus phase—Three
Basins, Tankersley Creek, Swauano Creek, and Big Cypress Creek. These subclusters are
hypothesized to represent discrete social groups. The Big Cypress Creek subcluster is
concentrated at Lake O’ the Pines, with two outliers found to the south along Little Cypress
Creek and the Sabine River. Engraved ceramics characteristic of this subcluster consist primarily
of Ripley Engraved and Taylor Engraved, with relatively insignificant amounts of Bailey
Engraved, Johns Engraved, and Wilder Engraved. Decorative motifs seen on Ripley Engraved
ceramics are mostly of the pendant triangle type, although the scroll, scroll and circle, and circle
and continuous scroll are not uncommon. Bullard Brushed and Karnack Brushed-Incised are the
dominant types of utilitarian ceramics, and Harleton Appliqué, Maydelle Incised, and the
McKinney Plain-like ceramics are less common than in the other subclusters. Belcher phase
trade vessels are also present, especially at the easternmost sites. The primary arrow point is the
Talco, although Maud and Bassett points are also present.
The Titus phase is somewhat imprecisely dated from ca. A.D. 1450 to perhaps as late as A.D. 1680
(Perttula 1992; Thurmond 1990). This evidence includes the reputed recovery by a private
collector of glass beads from a burial at the Tracey site (41CP71), which is a part of the Big
Cypress subcluster, and the discovery of the Wichita ceramic types Womack Engraved and
Womack Plain from the Culpepper (41HP1) and the W. A. Ford (41TT2) sites of the Three
Basins subcluster (Scurlock 1962; Thurmond 1990:233). Thurmond (1990:233) believes that,
considering the large number of Titus phase burials investigated over the years, the dearth of
historic-age material indicates a real decline in the Titus phase and an abandonment of the
western Cypress Creek basin prior to the beginning of the Historic period.

28

Thurmond’s (1990:233) reconstruction is that the people represented by the Cypress cluster were
reduced by disease in the Protohistoric period, with the result that, by the time the Spanish and
French became permanently established in the area, the upper Cypress Creek basin had been
abandoned. He identifies the Cypress cluster with the Lacane, a group visited by the de Soto
expedition in 1542. The Spanish exposed the Lacane to a variety of diseases to which they had
no resistance. Such diseases have been suggested to have had significant impacts upon other
groups in the Southeast (Dobyns 1983; Dye 1989; Murray 1989:49; Perttula 1993; Perttula et al.
1986:186–189; Smith 1989). Following this episode, the remnants of the Lacane left the area and
took refuge with the Hasinai and/or the Kadohadacho confederacies.

Historic Native American Period—Northeast Texas
The Historic Caddo period (A.D. 1680–1860) in Northeast Texas began with the founding of René
Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle’s, short-lived French colony on the Texas coast and ended
with the expulsion of the Caddo from Texas in 1859. During the closing decades of the
seventeenth century, French explorers (including the Sieur de Tonti, Bienville, and St. Denis)
traveled through the upper Red River valley and made contact with the Native Americans
residing in the area. The primary Native American groups inhabiting the Great BendNeches/Angelina river regions at that time consisted of Caddoan speakers, presumably
descendants of groups that had inhabited the area at least as far back as A.D. 800. These Caddoan
populations were divided very generally into the Kadohadacho in the Great Bend area north of
the Sulphur River, and the Hasinai in the Neches/Angelina River region south of the Sabine
River.
The groups in the northern area comprised the Kadohadacho Confederacy (Swanton 1946:141).
The confederacy was originally composed of five groups—the Kadohadacho, the Petit Caddo, the
Upper Natchitoches, the Upper Nasoni, and the Nanatsoho. According to Williams (1974:286),
the Upper Yatasi and the Cahinnio joined the confederacy at a later time, possibly in the early
eighteenth century in the case of the Cahinnio and in the 1760s in the case of the Yatasi. The
confederacy apparently controlled the entire Texas portion of the Great Bend region. Don
Domingo Terán de los Rios, who in 1692 visited one of the Kadohadacho villages located just
above the Great Bend of the Red River near present-day Texarkana (Swanton 1946:57), noted
that their power extended as far south as Big Cypress Bayou (Hackney 1966:3). The origin of the
confederacy is unknown at present, but it may have arisen as a result of what was probably a
severe demographic impact resulting from the de Soto entrada (cf., Smith 1989).
The Kadohadacho were a relatively sedentary group and suffered no severe displacement until the
Apache, Osage, and Kichai intruded into their areas in the early nineteenth century. Moderate
amounts of data are available from early European and Euro-American visits to the area. Two
archeological phases, the Little River and Chakanina, appear to fall within this early Historic
period in the Great Bend region (Kelley et al. 1988:27). Although the Little River phase was
originally proposed as the archeological remains of the entire Kadohadacho Confederacy, the
phase has become linked with the Roseborough Lake–Hatchel/Mitchell/Moores site complex
(41BW2/3/4/5) associated with the Upper Nasoni in Bowie County and several other sites
(Schambach 1982a). Ceramics from the Roseborough Lake–Hatchell/Mitchell/Moores complex
consist of trailed, engraved, neck-banded, and plain types. Historic-age glass beads and metal
fragments have also been recovered from the complex (Story 1990:348). The Chakanina phase
has been defined mostly on the assemblage from the Cedar Grove site (3LA97) in Arkansas
29

(Schambach 1982a). Schambach believes this phase to represent the Kadohadacho proper and
excludes the closely associated Upper Nasoni, Upper Natchitoches, and the Nanatsoho groups.
Ceramics are decorated with engraving, incising, and appliqué. Much of the utility ware is shelltempered.
The introduction of European diseases severely reduced the Caddo groups even though
widespread contact was restricted until the 1700s. The loss of population likely resulted in
emigration from the Sulphur River area, possibly leaving only enclaves along major trails and
portages such as the Nasoni portage in Bowie County (Peter and Cliff 1990a:33). Between 1788
and 1790, the groups of the Kadohadacho Confederacy were forced south into Louisiana by the
severity of raids by the Osage (Smith 1995:82–83; Williams 1974:297). At that time, they settled
with the Petit Caddo, near Caddo Lake on Cypress Creek, about 35 miles west of the main branch
of the Red River (Smith 1995:83), where they were encountered by Freeman and Custis in 1806
(Flores 1984:16, fn 3). In the Caddo Treaty of 1835, the Kadohadacho sold their land in the
United States and agreed to leave the country within one year (Smith 1995:122; Williams
1974:309); but as late as 1840, one band remained in the Caddo Lake area, possibly in the same
village, which was along the Louisiana-Texas border (Smith 1995:143–146). In 1841, this band
joined the rest of the Kadohadacho in Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) north of the Red
River (Smith 1995:146). The rest of the Caddo remained in Texas, but by 1855, they were
residing, along with other Native American groups, on a tract of land on the Brazos River in
Northcentral Texas. Subsequently, they were moved north to Indian Territory in 1859 (Swanton
1946:99).
After the abandonment of the Great Bend region by the Kadohadacho, groups of displaced Native
Americans from east of the Mississippi River began to move into Caddo territory in Spanish
Texas. These movements were in response to the increasing pressure to give up their traditional
livelihoods and become incorporated into Anglo-American culture (Everett 1990). The Spanish
initially welcomed these groups with the idea of using them to create a “buffer” between the
Spanish settlements in Texas and the land-hungry Anglo-Americans. Unfortunately, as more of
these groups (such as the Choctaw, Delaware, Quapaw, Shawnee, Cherokee, and AlabamaKoasati) moved into East Texas, they began increasingly to compete with the Caddo for a
diminishing resource base. This problem was exacerbated following the sale of Louisiana to the
United States in 1803, when Anglo-Americans began moving into Northeast Texas as well
(Perttula 1988a:21), and was not ultimately resolved until both the Caddo and most of the
immigrant groups were expelled following the Texas Revolution of 1835.
In the Neches/Angelina River region, the Hasinai Caddo likely encountered Europeans first in
1542 when the remnants of the Spanish Hernando de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso
Alvarado, entered their territory. Their next contact with Europeans occurred in 1686 when the
Frenchman La Salle stayed several days in the Hasinai village of Cenis while searching for the
Mississippi (Story 1982). The Hasinai, whose cultural area was centered on the middle Neches
and upper Angelina river valleys, were the most socially advanced and influential group in the
region. The largest of the Hasinai residential/ceremonial centers has been found at the George C.
Davis site (41CE19) in Cherokee County. Another important center has been identified at the
Deshazo site (41NA27) in adjacent Nacogdoches County. The term “Hasinai” means “our own
people” and the term “Texas” or “Tejas” (meaning “friend”) derives from the Hasinai form of
greeting (Bolton 1987).

30

The Hasinai were organized in a loose confederacy composed primarily of the Hainais,
Nabedaches, Nacogdoches, Nasonis, Nadacos, Neches, Naconos, Nechauis, and Nacaos, but
membership apparently was fluid and fluctuating (Story 1990:322). An intertribal organization
pertaining especially to religious beliefs was the basis of this confederacy. At the top of a
relatively weak social and political hierarchy was the grand xinesi, along with the subordinate
chiefs of each tribe and their lesser officials (Bolton 1987; Story 1982:21). Although males
inherited these offices, females often held powerful positions and descent was likely through the
female line.
René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, established Fort Saint Louis on the Gulf coast in 1685
(John 1975:182). By 1686, he had traveled northward to Caddo country. Father Anastasius
Douay, a member of the La Salle expedition, reported on his observations of Caddo culture.
According to Douay, the Hasinai village of Cenis (an Allen phase [ca. A.D. 1650–1800] Caddo
settlement) was extremely large, but settlements within the village were dispersed into small
hamlets of 10 or 12 houses (Swanton 1942:39). The apparent reason for this housing
arrangement was to provide each family with nearby cropland and access to water for household
use and frequent bathing (Hatcher 1928:154). Subsistence was based on cultivated corn, beans,
calabashes, and sunflowers, along with the quickly adopted European watermelon. Seasonal wild
acorns, nuts, grapes, plums, persimmon, berries, roots, and herbs supplemented the cultigens, and
meat protein was obtained from fish, deer, bison, rabbit, birds, bear, snake, and turtle (Griffin
1954:110, 113; Swanton 1942:128, 132–133). Tools to procure these food items consisted of
stone dart and arrow points, woven baskets, pottery cooking vessels, and wooden mortar and
pestles (Story 1982:22). Shell, ceramics, stone, and salt were commonly traded over wellestablished exchange routes that long-preceded European contact. Funerary practices were
predicated on the status of the individual. The most elaborate ceremonies were held for the
xinesi, with the attendance of all members of the confederacy, and the least elaborate were for
simple members of the group. Although the dead were buried with bows, arrows, knives, food,
and domestic items, the status of the individual determined the items (Newcomb 1961:301;
Swanton 1942:203–204).
By the late 1600s, a regular European presence/settlement into Caddo territory had begun. In
1690 the Spanish established missions in the Hasinai area—San Francisco de los Tejas and
Santísimo Nombre de María—but abandoned them in 1693 when the local population refused to
comply with Spanish attempts to convert and control them (Swanton 1942:46–49). In response to
St. Denis’s 1714 French trading post at Natchitoches, three more Spanish missions were
established in 1716—a second Mission San Francisco de los Tejas just east of the Neches River,
and two in the main villages of the Hasinai (Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción, likely on
the Angelina River) and the Nacogdoches (Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, likely on Bayou La
Naña) (Swanton 1942:46–49). In 1779 a group of Euro-American settlers from the Trinity River
moved into the Nacogdoches area and a rancher set up operations on Bayou Loco near or on the
DeShazo site. These moves, as well as intruding Indian groups, forced the Hasinai to immigrate
westward to the prairie or to withdraw into smaller villages. The French briefly regained control
of Louisiana, only to lose it again in 1803 when President Jefferson bought the Louisiana
Purchase. The way was now open for intense American immigration, which effectively forced
the remaining Hasinai to move to a reservation on the Brazos in 1845, and then finally to Indian
Territory in Oklahoma in 1859 (Newcomb 1961:289; Swanton 1942:71–88).

Northcentral Texas
This synopsis deals with the Dallas and Paris districts, which are archeologically distinct from the
northeastern portion of the state. In general, the prehistoric cultural chronology is quite different,
though the Paleo-Indian period discussion presented for Northeast Texas can be applied to
Northcentral Texas as well. There are, however, some differences; Northcentral Texas is known
for several highly significant sites that have helped to shape our understanding of the earliest
occupation of the New World. These sites and others are discussed in the following section.

Paleo-Indian Period
Point types found in Northcentral Texas that can be associated with the early to late parts of the
period include Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Plainview, San Patrice, and Scottsbluff. Based on a
sample of projectile points from surface sites, Prikryl (1990) has concluded that among the most
common Paleo-Indian point types in this area are Plainview and Dalton. Ferring and Yates
(1997) suggest that these types date to about 10,000–9,500 years ago, based on cross-dating with
other regions. The suggested age for these types may correspond with the onset of early
Holocene alluviation in the local river valleys, including the Trinity and Sabine. The majority of
the recorded Paleo-Indian sites cluster in the upper Trinity drainage, where the most intensive
archeological investigations have taken place, though often these sites consist of no more than
one or two projectile points. As with many other areas of Texas, Paleo-Indian materials in
Northcentral Texas often are found in surface contexts or mixed with later materials. The
generally low density of Paleo-Indian artifacts and sites and the tendency for projectile points to
be made from nonlocal lithics have led investigators to characterize these populations as highly
mobile, with low regional densities (Lynott 1981:100–101).
The Paleo-Indian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or from stratigraphically mixed contexts
(Meltzer 1987; Meltzer and Bever 1995). The Field Ranch site (41CO10), along the upper Elm
Fork of the Trinity River, is a prime example of typical site contexts (Jensen 1968).
Interestingly, the only two investigated sites in Northcentral Texas with apparently discrete
Paleo-Indian components—the Lewisville Lake and Aubrey sites, located in the northern part of
the Dallas District—are early, both producing Clovis projectile points. The Lewisville Lake site
(41DN72) contained 27 hearth features with an associated Clovis point and other sparse lithics
(Crook and Harris 1957, 1958; Story 1990:182–184). Although the original radiocarbon dates on
the hearths suggested an anomalously early age for Clovis points (ca. 37,000 B.P.), later work by
the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford 1981) appears to have resolved the controversy concerning
the date of the occupation there. Apparently, the presence of naturally occurring lignite in these
hearths, either as a fuel or as an inadvertent inclusion, contaminated the radiocarbon samples.
Consequently, the usually accepted date of 12,000–10,000 B.P. for Clovis period occupations is
probably a reasonable estimate for the first human occupation of Northcentral Texas. The deeply
buried Aubrey site (41DN479), located on the Elm Fork north of Dallas, yielded lithic debitage
and Clovis points buried beneath 8 m of Holocene alluvium on the Elm Fork flood plain (Ferring
1989, 2001). The discovery of this site suggests that well-preserved Paleo-Indian sites in
Northcentral Texas will only be found by examining deeply stratified Holocene alluvium in
modern flood plain situations.

32

The Lewisville Lake and Aubrey sites contained a variety of faunal remains, both large and small.
The largest, white-tailed deer, can be associated comfortably with the Clovis occupation at the
Lewisville Lake site. The preponderance of small game at the Aubrey site could be interpreted as
representing a more generalized pattern of foraging than the reliance on mammoth and bison
apparently demonstrated at Clovis sites on the Southern Plains (Hofman 1989a:31–32). Such a
divergence in subsistence patterns may reflect an inherent adaptability of Clovis technology to
changing environmental conditions encountered as early populations spread southeastward into
Texas (Ferring and Yates 1997).
There are no excavated and reported Paleo-Indian components on the central Blackland Prairie
itself. Nonetheless, a variety of early points has been found, largely in surface contexts, and it is
clear that this part of Texas was used throughout the period from ca. 10,000 to 6,500 B.C.
Presumably, this use was by hunter-gatherer groups with low population densities and high
residential mobility. An analysis of materials collected by C. K. Chandler and other avocational
archeologists from sites chiefly in Ellis County during the Superconducting Super Collider
project identified a handful of Paleo-Indian projectile points typed as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton,
Golondrina, and San Patrice, along with several untyped lanceolate specimens (Yedlowski et al.
1998). Other early materials from the area include a few San Patrice points from the RichlandChambers Reservoir (McGregor and Bruseth 1987) and a cache of 23 prismatic blades from a site
in Navarro County (Young and Collins 1989).

Archaic Period
For Northcentral Texas, the Archaic is tentatively dated between ca. 6500 B.C. and A.D. 700, with
segments of approximately 2,500 years often considered as early, middle, and late divisions of the
period (Prikryl 1993:199). Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from 6500 to 4000 B.C., the
Middle Archaic from 4000 to 1500 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 1500 B.C. to A.D. 700.
Relatively recent overviews that cover the Archaic in this portion of Texas include Hofman
(1989a), Prikryl (1990), and Story (1985, 1990). Diagnostic artifacts for the period are similar to
those of adjacent regions, although developing a sound chronological sequence of diagnostic tool
types has proven difficult, because many of the investigations have focused on surface
manifestations. Prikryl (1990) suggests that Early Archaic projectile points include early splitstemmed varieties and possibly Angostura, and Middle Archaic points include basal-notched
forms such as Bell, Andice, and Calf Creek along with Wells, Dawson, Carrollton, and Bulverde.
Late Archaic point types reportedly include Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood, Ellis, Trinity,
Palmillas, Yarbrough, Dallas, Godley, Elam, and Gary (Prikryl 1990). At one time, the
Carrollton and Elam foci were used to define the Middle and Late Archaic, respectively (Crook
and Harris 1952, 1954). Reevaluation of the type site artifacts, however, showed that the
materials were so mixed that perpetuation of these foci provides little interpretive value (Hofman
et al. 1989; Prikryl 1990). Some of this mixing and the generally low numbers of Early and
Middle Archaic sites may be due to extensive erosion of mid-Holocene deposits, as has been
documented for the Brazos drainage west of the Dallas District in Young, Stephens and
Throckmorton counties (Ensor et al. 1992).
Though few isolable components have been analyzed for the various divisions of the Archaic
period in Northcentral Texas, slowly increasing populations responding to warmer and drier
environmental conditions have been postulated to explain the overall archeological record of the
period (Lynott 1981; Story 1990). It is thought that these factors may have led Archaic
33

populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of Northcentral Texas to develop a diversified
hunting and gathering pattern based on bottomland resources of the rivers and major creeks,
while populations on the Rolling Plains maintained a focus on bison hunting (Hofman 1989a).
Projectile points of the period were fashioned from local lithic materials, suggesting that
populations were less mobile than were their Paleo-Indian predecessors. Less mobility also may
suggest refinement of the diversified subsistence pattern to include scheduling of resource use
within more restricted areas. Evidence from Late Archaic sites at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and
McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and Yates 1997) indicates repeated site
occupation by small groups, which could support the resource-scheduling hypothesis. Still, even
with refinement of resource utilization, evidence of dietary stress has been found on Late Archaic
human skeletal materials (Ferring and Yates 1997; Gill-King 1987).
Mixing of components also has hampered interpretations regarding downstream Trinity River use
by Native Americans during the lengthy Archaic period. Because few pure Archaic components
have been excavated, particularly ones dating to the first two-thirds of the period, it is difficult to
say much about artifact chronologies, subsistence practices, or settlement strategies. A variety of
projectile point styles traditionally associated with the Early and Middle Archaic period in
Central Texas—for example, Andice, Angostura, Bell, Gower, Hoxie, Martindale, Nolan, Travis,
and Uvalde (Yedlowski et al. 1998)—was identified during analyses for the Superconducting
Super Collider project (although a host of other types perhaps dating to this time and later were
identified as well, their chronologies are less certain), but these points are few in number and do
not appear to represent major occupation of this part of the Blackland Prairie. Demonstrably
early points were even scarcer at the nearby Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir and the
Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills Reservoir, with a Hoxie point from Pecan Springs being the
clearest example (Duffield 1963; Sorrow et al. 1966). The relatively intensive work at RichlandChambers Reservoir suggests a similar conclusion for the western edge of the Oak Woodlands,
although it has been noted that data pertaining to the Early to Middle Archaic may be scarce in
part because sites dating to this interval lie deeply buried or were removed by extensive erosion
during the mid-Holocene (Fields 1995; McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Only a few radiocarbon
assays predating 4,000 B.P. were obtained, but points dated to this interval in Central Texas (for
example, Bell/Andice/Calf Creek and Hoxie) occur at the Richland-Chambers Reservoir in only
very small numbers.
A much different picture is presented for the late portion of the Archaic period, after about
2000 B.C. All areas of the central Blackland Prairie that have been studied archeologically
contain sites dating to this period, and the Late Archaic represents the earliest time for which
much is known about Native American lifeways. Both the Pecan Springs and Strawn Creek sites
on the Blackland Prairie proper yielded such Late Archaic point types as Gary, Dawson, and
Yarbrough, although they tend to be mixed with materials from later occupations (Duffield 1963;
Sorrow et al. 1966). The surface collections analyzed during the Superconducting Super Collider
project also contained these types, as well as a number of Late Archaic types common in Central
Texas—such as Bulverde, Darl, Ensor, Marcos, Marshall, Montell, and Pedernales—and a variety
of probable Late Archaic forms more characteristic of the northern and eastern parts of the state,
such as Carrollton, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, and Kent (Yedlowski et al. 1998). Noting the
relatively high frequency of Late Archaic projectile points, Yedlowski et al. (1998) suggest that
the region saw an increased use by hunter-gatherers as a result of moister climatic conditions than
before, presumably associated with greater productivity in subsistence resources. They also note
that, while the projectile point evidence indicates interaction with groups living in Central Texas
proper, larger proportions of points indicate affinities with eastern Texas than during the Early
and Middle Archaic.
34

Brown (1987:44-22 through 44-26) presents similar conclusions concerning an increase in
occupational intensity and increased interaction for those project areas at the eastern edge of the
region, i.e., Cedar Creek Reservoir (southeastern Kaufman County) and Richland-Chambers
Reservoir (southeastern Navarro County). Two of the three excavated sites at Cedar Creek
Reservoir have strong Late Archaic components represented by numerous Gary points and a
variety of other lithic tools (Story 1965), while at least 15 sites at Richland-Chambers Reservoir
have identifiable components of this age. In addition to constellations of projectile point styles
(e.g., Dawson, Gary, Godley, Kent, and Yarbrough) that indicate ties more to the north and east
than to the south and west, each of these areas has yielded information suggesting that ceramics
may have been introduced into the material culture of local groups during the latest part of the
Late Archaic, as they were across most of Texas to the east (where this interval usually is called
the Early Ceramic period, and sometimes the Woodland period).
At Cedar Creek Reservoir, there are hints in the distributional data from the Lacy and Gossett
Bottoms sites that the initial use of ceramic containers preceded introduction of the bow and
arrow, although it is difficult to be certain because the sites were not well stratified and the sherds
could not be related to known early types such as Williams Plain (Story 1965). At RichlandChambers Reservoir, distinctive shell-tempered sherds were recovered from contexts dated
between A.D. 200 and 700 at the Adams Ranch site (Bruseth and Martin 1987), apparently
representing the earliest ceramic industry in this part of the Trinity River basin.
The most complete picture of the archeology of the Late Archaic for this region comes from the
Oak Woodlands at the eastern margin of the Blackland Prairie. Along Richland and Chambers
creeks, Late Archaic groups appear to have been hunter-gatherers whose subsistence pursuits
focused on wild plant foods, such as hickory nuts and prairie turnip, and faunal taxa such as deer,
turtles, small mammals, birds, and fish (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). Although presumably not
sedentary, these groups clearly used the area in an intensive fashion for residential purposes, and
it appears that populations increased while territory sizes decreased. A conspicuous component
of the record is the so-called “Wylie pit,” which are large man-made depressions measuring
approximately 16 m (52.5 ft) in diameter and 0.61 m (2 ft) in depth, excavated at the Bird Point
Island and Adams Ranch sites. These were large features that appear to have been used for
communal processing of vegetal resources (and later as cemeteries), perhaps in the context of
band aggregation in “tension zones” as territories decreased in size (McGregor and Bruseth
1987).
Human burials are common in the archeological record of the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric
periods of at least the eastern part of Northcentral Texas (Prikryl 1993). Some of these burials are
associated with Wylie pit features. These features were first identified at a series of sites along
the East Fork of the Trinity River and were considered an important trait of the Wylie focus
(Harris and Suhm 1963; Stephenson 1952; Wilson 1946). Radiocarbon assays from pits at the
Upper Rockwall and Sister Grove Creek sites in the area of Lavon Lake suggest that the pits and
the Wylie focus were associated with the Late Prehistoric period (Lynott 1975; Ross 1966).
Lynott (1977) widened the temporal span by incorporating a Late Archaic phase into the focus
definition. Subsequent work on Wylie pits at Richland-Chambers Reservoir to the south
confirmed their Late Archaic age (Bruseth and Martin 1987). Nonetheless, the wide range of
associated artifact types and the long time span represented by the pits made it clear that the
Wylie focus was not a useful construct. Bruseth and Martin (1987), while discarding the focus as
unusable, further supported Lynott’s (1975) original interpretation of the pits as being associated
with large-scale food processing. Their interpretation equates the pits to the burned rock middens
of Central Texas, with both representing group aggregations.
35

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 700–1700) is marked by the initial
appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the start of this period is based upon dated
contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage to the west. Group aggregation and
large-scale manipulation of subsistence resources, as represented by the Wylie pits and the human
burials they contain, may be indicative of societal changes that continued through the Late
Prehistoric period. Habitation structures indicating increased sedentism, at least in certain places
and at certain times, have been found in some Late Prehistoric sites, along with cultigens, such as
corn, and arrow points and ceramics indicating important technological changes. Also, there may
be evidence (e.g., the distinction between burials placed inside and outside Wylie pits) of
differential mortuary practices that could reflect a shift toward a hierarchical social structure,
although this evidence is nowhere near as strong as that for the Caddo area of northeast Texas.
Both Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) have proposed that the Late Prehistoric period be divided
into an early and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the foraging
subsistence system of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting Southern
Plains influences. Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this
period (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970).
Prikryl’s (1990, 1993) Late Prehistoric I period (A.D. 700-1200) is marked by the Scallorn,
Catahoula, Steiner, Alba, and Bonham arrow point types. Ceramic vessels are mostly grogtempered and undecorated, but some evidence indicates influences from other regions in some
locally manufactured wares displaying designs similar to those associated with East Texas
Caddoan ceramic types. Evidence for corn and structures has been found at sites at Joe Pool Lake
in western Dallas County as well as to the north at Hubert Moss Lake near the Red River (Lorrain
1969; Martin 1994; Peter and McGregor 1988). Farther west, cultural changes also were taking
place on the Rolling Plains, though this area held onto its Archaic lifestyle even after
technological innovations such as the bow and arrow were accepted (Lynott 1981).
As a result of intensive excavations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake, Peter and
McGregor (1988) proposed a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site
yielded house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn
cupules. Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late
twelfth or early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an
intrusive Caddoan occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have
occurred, in at least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also
likely that ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
In regard to the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) summarized the results of that research as follows:
Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites
which lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the
project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500–650 yr. bp. No evidence of
horticulture was recovered, and the [Late Prehistoric II] fauna indicate a foraging strategy that
emphasized deer procurement and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw
materials was about as frequent as in the [Late Archaic], and long-distance raw material acquisition
(e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced
shell-tempered wares, which by this time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally.
As recorded by previous synthesis (Story 1990) little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is
indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of
the [Late Prehistoric] period largely independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands.
36

More recently, McGregor (personal communication 1999) has argued strongly for a “middle
subperiod” of the Late Prehistoric that he dates between A.D. 1000 and 1350. He believes that
arrow points with straight or rectangular stems are most diagnostic of this period and identifies
three sites or site areas with relatively clean (or minimally mixed) components of this middle
subperiod—the Cobb-Pool site, Area B at the McDonald site (41HI105) on Hackberry Creek on
the middle Brazos River drainage, and Area F at the Haley’s Point site (34MA15) on the Red
River (Brown et al. 1987; Peter and McGregor 1988; Rohn 1998). McGregor also notes that
maize is common at Haley’s Point, as it is at Cobb-Pool, and suggests that these sites are
representative of a relatively short-lived, region-wide subsistence pattern involving a partial
dependence on agriculture during this middle subperiod (McGregor, personal communication
1999).
Sites dating to the Late Prehistoric period, after ca. A.D. 700, also are common downstream on the
Trinity area of the Blackland Prairie. The collections studied during the Superconducting Super
Collider project contain substantial numbers of both early (e.g., Alba, Bonham, Catahoula,
Colbert, Scallorn, and Steiner) and late (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz) arrow points, but Yedlowski et
al. (1998) note that early arrow points are more frequent, perhaps reflecting high population
densities continuing from the Late Archaic period. Other than the Perdiz and Scallorn types,
which have such widespread distributions, the arrow point styles point eastward and northward.
The limited ceramic samples, containing sherds reminiscent of types such as Weches Fingernail
Impressed, Killough Pinched, Maydelle Incised, and Poyner Engraved, also support interaction
with Caddoan groups to the east (Yedlowski et al. 1998). The Strawn Creek site at Navarro Mills
Reservoir presents a similar picture, with most of the typed arrow points dating to the first half of
the Late Prehistoric period and the more distinctive ceramics in the small collection relating to the
early Caddoan types, Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Weches Fingernail Impressed (Duffield
1963). The Pecan Springs site at Bardwell Reservoir also yielded numerous early arrow points,
as well as a respectable number of Perdiz points, along with a small collection of highly
fragmented sherds (Sorrow et al. 1966).
Three sites excavated at Cedar Creek Reservoir contained Late Prehistoric components, although
materials of this age were common only at the Gossett Bottoms and Lacy sites (Story 1965).
Early arrow point forms (e.g., Alba, Catahoula, Friley, Granbury, Scallorn, and Steiner) are better
represented than late ones (e.g., Cliffton and Perdiz), but not by much. Not surprisingly, ceramics
are more frequent in this area than to the west and clearly are related to the Caddoan tradition to
the east and northeast; some of the more distinctive decorated sherds were considered reminiscent
of types such as Canton Incised, Killough Pinched, and Ripley or Wilder Engraved (Story 1965).
The faunal remains from the Gossett Bottoms and Lacy sites, many of which probably relate to
Late Prehistoric occupations, consist predominantly of deer, turtles, and small mammals, with
bison occurring only in small numbers. Based on the feature evidence (or lack thereof), it appears
that this part of the Trinity basin was occupied by mobile hunter-gatherers rather than sedentary
groups during the Late Prehistoric period.
Some of the best data concerning Native American use of the region during the Late Prehistoric
period is from Richland-Chambers Reservoir. Sites dating to this interval are common at
Richland-Chambers Reservoir, especially for the early half of the period, and it appears that there
was a significant decline in population densities after about A.D. 1300 (McGregor and Bruseth
1987). The data suggest that most of the excavated sites with Late Prehistoric components were
used for residential purposes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987), although there are some sites, for
example the stream-side concentrations of mussel shells and artifacts at 41FT193 and 41NV139,
37

which probably were used in a more limited fashion. The house patterns at the Bird Point Island
site point to intensive use by sedentary hunter-gatherers during the first half of the period, and
other components that are contemporaneous, slightly earlier, or later (e.g., at Bird Point Island,
Adams Ranch, Irvine, and Little Cedar Creek) have middens and numerous features suggesting
intensive use but no houses. These components may represent occupations that were seasonal in
length. Macrobotanical remains point to use primarily of wild plant foods, i.e., hardwood nuts, a
variety of seeds, and tubers/rhizomes (McGregor and Bruseth 1987). The only tropical cultigen is
maize, and it occurs in very small quantities only in contexts dating to the last half of the period.
Hence, groups who lived in this area were predominantly hunters and gatherers. The arrow
points that characterize the early and late parts of the period—Alba, Scallorn, and Steiner vs.
Perdiz and Cliffton—are the same styles as found elsewhere across the area, and it appears that
Gary dart points may have continued to be used through the early Late Prehistoric (McGregor and
Bruseth 1987:183). Ceramics are moderately common and clearly relate to Caddoan wares, with
most of the identified types (e.g., Maydelle Incised, Poyner Engraved, and Weches Fingernail
Impressed) indicating contact with groups in the Neches River drainage, east of the Trinity.
During the Late Prehistoric II period (A.D. 1200-1700), influences from the Southern Plains
became pronounced in the Cross Timbers and prairie areas. These influences coincided with an
increase in bison herd size in Northcentral Texas (Lynott 1981; Prikryl 1990). Bison was
important to subsistence, but shrinking procurement territory sizes due to population increases
continued the trend toward horticulture and settled village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris
and Morris 1970). In terms of technology, a Plains Indian tool assemblage was common (Prikryl
1990). Items associated with this assemblage include calcareous-tempered ceramic vessels, some
of which fit the description for the type Nocona Plain (shell-tempered), and unstemmed triangular
arrow points such as Maud, Fresno, Harrell, Washita, and Perdiz points. Tools specific to bison
processing include snub-nosed or thumbnail scrapers and edge-beveled Harahey knives. Bison
scapula hoes, which also are common in Plains Indian sites, have been recovered from sites in the
Lewisville Lake and Lavon Lake areas of Denton and Collin counties (Barber 1969; Harris 1945).
The Plains Indian influences associated with settled village life were used to define the Henrietta
complex of Northcentral Texas. This complex, based on Krieger’s (1946) more expansive
Henrietta focus, extends from the Red River south along the headwaters of the Trinity and Brazos
rivers. The type site, M. D. Harrell, is located along the Brazos River in Young County just
northwest of Palo Pinto County in the drainage basin for Possum Kingdom Reservoir (Krieger
1946). The Harrell site and other associated sites contain middens, house structures, rock hearths,
storage pits, and burials, and they most often are located on sandy knolls or terraces overlooking
river valleys (Brooks 1989; Forrester 1994). Excavated sites attributed to the Henrietta complex
include the Coyote and Glass sites located on the Red River in Montague County (Lorrain 1967;
Woodall 1967a), and it is clear that sites such as Dillard in Cooke County are related as well
(Martin 1994).
The Henrietta complex as an investigative tool can be limiting since its loose definition tends to
obscure local differences. More recent investigations in the upper Trinity River drainage have
tended to highlight the local differences. At Ray Roberts Reservoir, for instance, Ferring and
Yates (1997) see local trends emerging independent of extraregional influences. They cite the
lack of evidence for extensive maize horticulture and the preponderance of short-term logistical
camps as the basis of their hypothesis. Similarly, Peter and McGregor (1988) demonstrated that
occupation of the Mountain Creek drainage was less intensive in the Late Prehistoric II period
than before and that maize horticulture, if practiced at all, was limited. The adaptation
developing in Northcentral Texas after A.D. 1200 was truly distinctive from the Plains adaptations
revealed to the northwest in Foard County (Peter et al. 1997).
38

Historic Native American—Northcentral Texas
The cultural divergences between Northcentral and Northeast Texas, which began in the Archaic
period, continued into the Protohistoric and Historic periods. Various sociological factors, not the
least of which was the colonization of New Mexico by the Spanish, caused drastic changes in the
cultural makeup of Northcentral Texas, as groups from elsewhere migrated into the area and
existing groups were forced to adapt to their presence. Meanwhile, the Caddoan groups
continued to dominate the Northeastern portion of the state, although significant changes were
occurring there also. Both regions will be treated separately in the following sections.
Prior to Spanish settlement of New Mexico in 1598, European presence in Texas was sporadic at
best. After 1598, however, Spanish influence was never absent from the Southern Plains,
although actual contact with Europeans continued to be limited and only brief records of journeys
into or through the North Texas area exist (Hofman et al. 1989; John 1975).
By the eighteenth century, immigrant Plains Indian groups had moved into and beyond North
Texas, and their documentation by traders and explorers marks the start of the Historic period
(A.D. 1700 to 1850; Prikryl 1993). Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very
sparse for the upper Trinity River basin during the early Historic era, it is not clear which specific
aboriginal groups were residing in the present-day region at the beginning of this period. What is
clear is that the early Historic period in North Texas was a time of population fluctuation,
movement, and amalgamation (see Newcomb 1993).
Documentary sources suggest that the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai, Yojaune,
Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo traversed the region at various times during the period
(Campbell 1983; Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982). Prior to about A.D. 1725–
1750, Apachean groups appear to have dominated the western portion of the Southern Plains,
known as the High Plains. After that time, the area was increasingly controlled by the Comanche
and Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern Plains, within the area now known as the
Lower Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes became dominant (Bell et al. 1967;
Hofman 1989b:91).
Available data suggest that many of the aboriginal occupants of the eastern margin of the Great
Plains, including North Texas, were Caddoan language speakers, from the Arikara in the north to
the Wichita and Kichai in the south. In this light, it is worth noting that it has also been suggested
that the Socoatino, encountered by the survivors of the Hernando de Soto expedition in the
sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and were the same as the Canohatino, identified by the
French in the latter part of the seventeenth century, apparently located at that time “on the
Blackland Prairies between the Guadalupe and Trinity rivers to the east of present-day San
Antonio, Austin, and Waco” (Newcomb 1993:24). However, if the prehistoric occupants of the
eastern margin of the plains in Texas were indeed Caddoan speakers, it would explain how they
were absorbed very early by other Caddoan-speaking groups (such as the Yojuane, Kichai,
Tawakoni, Taovayas, Iscani, and Wichita proper) who arrived in Northcentral Texas in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated to form
the historic Wichita Tribe. Some, however, were probably absorbed by the united Caddo Tribes,
and some may even have joined amalgamations of a variety of groups, such as the Tonkawa,
during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

39

The term Wichita is commonly used to refer to a group of linguistically related tribes, including
the Wichita, Taovayas, Tawakoni, Iscani, Waco, and Kichai. Many of these groups apparently
entered the Southern Plains in the seventeenth century, probably from Kansas and southern
Nebraska, to escape the hostilities of the Osage (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:904). The Wichita
were true Plains Villagers, with an economy that was jointly dependent upon agriculture and
bison hunting. They occupied permanent villages of beehive-shaped, grass houses, from which
they conducted semi-nomadic bison hunts. In 1719, their villages were located along the
Arkansas River in northern Oklahoma (Hofman 1989b:95). By 1750, they had moved some of
their villages to southern Oklahoma, along the Red River. Others were located on the upper end
of the Sabine and Neches rivers in Texas and subsequently on the middle Trinity and upper
Brazos rivers. In 1759, the Taovayas village on the Red River was attacked by Diego Ortiz
Parrilla, but was successfully defended. In 1772, the year they concluded a nominal peace with
the Spanish, one of their villages was on the Salt Fork of the Brazos, on the Lower Plains west of
present-day Dallas/Fort Worth (John 1975:Map 3; Webb and Carroll 1952:2:705). Wichita
groups were included in treaties made with the Republic of Texas in 1843 and with the United
States in 1837 and 1856 (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:709). In Texas, they continued to live
between the upper Brazos and Trinity rivers until 1855. In that year, the Tawakoni and Waco
were placed on the Brazos Indian Reservation, south of Fort Belknap, in company with a number
of other Native American remnant groups (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:212; 2:905).
Subsequently, as a result of increasing animosity from white settlers, they were removed to Indian
Territory in 1859 (Smith 1996; Webb and Carroll 1952:1:210). The remnants of the Wichita
moved to Kansas during the Civil War, but returned to Oklahoma after the war to settle
permanently near present-day Anadarko (Hofman 1989b:95).
Although archeological sites that can be associated definitely with various historic-age groups are
few, sites attributable to the historic Wichita have been identified at the edges of Northcentral
Texas. Among these is the Stansbury site located in Hill County, now inundated by Lake
Whitney (Stephenson 1970). Excavations at the site produced burials, house structures, storage
pits, and a variety of aboriginal artifacts along with European ceramics, glass beads, metal arrow
points, and flintlock musket parts. A cluster of Wichita sites also occurs to the north along the
Red River in Montague County. These sites are known collectively as “Spanish Fort” and occur
on both the Oklahoma and Texas sides of the river. Woodall (1967b) excavated one of these
sites, named the Upper Tucker site. The site produced artifacts and features similar to those
discovered at the Stansbury site. Wichita sites on both the Brazos and Red rivers were located
atop high terraces overlooking the rivers. Within the upper Trinity River basin, little evidence of
these historic-age Indian groups has been found, with the exception of a few Native American
sites with European items (Sollberger 1953).
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the physical presence of Europeans on the Southern
Plains became commonplace. This was the result of increasingly peaceful relations between the
Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north, and the acquisition of the Louisiana
Territory by the United States in 1803.

EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The period of European exploration and settlement and the subsequent Euro-American and
African-American development of North Texas are briefly covered in the remaining portions of
this chapter. For more extensive treatments of this period in North Texas, see Peter and Cliff
(1990a: Chapters 3 and 7) and Peter et al. (1991:Appendix J).
40

The initial European penetration into the general area of North Texas occurred in the middle of
the sixteenth century (around 1542) when the survivors of the Hernando de Soto entrada, led by
Luís de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered Texas in their attempt to reach New Spain by land
(Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Weddle 1985). Moscoso’s exact route is unknown, but
archeological studies indicate that he apparently traversed the Red River valley somewhere
between present-day Shreveport, Louisiana, and Texarkana, Texas. The party crossed the Red
River and journeyed through Northcentral Texas to present-day Wichita Falls before returning to
the Mississippi River to travel to the Gulf of Mexico. Recent reconstructions of the Moscoso
route through Texas (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991) equate the province of “Naguatex” with the
Hatchel-Mitchell-Moores site complex in northern Bowie County, suggesting that from here the
entrada moved southwest through current Bowie County to cross the Sulphur River somewhere
in the vicinity of present-day Douglassville, where Wright Patman Lake is located.
In the late 1600s, the Spanish introduced the first of their missions into East Texas. The goal of
these missions was to remove the indigenous religions and to Christianize the native populations.
In 1690 the Spanish established missions in the Hasinai area—San Francisco de los Tejas and
Santísimo Nombre de María—but abandoned them in 1693 when the local population refused to
comply with Spanish attempts to convert and control them (Swanton 1942:46–49).
The French, led by René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, first intruded into eastern Texas by
establishing Fort Saint Louis in 1685 (John 1975:182), and in 1714 St. Denis set up a trading post
at Natchitoches (in present-day Louisiana). Spanish fear of an increased French presence in
Texas led to the decision in 1716, to try again to establish a series of missions and presidios in
East Texas—this time a second Mission San Francisco de los Tejas near the Neches River,
Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción (later moved to the San Antonio area in 1731) on the
Angelina River, the Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe at present-day Nacogdoches, San Jose de los
Nazonis, and Nuestra Señora de los Ais, as well as San Miguel de Lineares de los Adaes in
present-day Louisiana—as a buffer against further French encroachment into that region (Cooper
et al. 2002; Pool 1975:28; Swanton 1942:46–49). When France and Spain went to war, the
French at Natchitoches attacked the Spanish settlement of Los Adaes, forcing the Spanish to
abandon the area once again (Newcomb 1961:288). After the truce in 1721, the Spanish
representative Marques de Aguayo persuaded the French to withdraw from Texas. He
reestablished the missions and set Los Adaes as the capital of the Province of Texas. After
briefly regaining control of the area, the French sold it as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.
In the Red River area, the French established Le Poste des Cadodaquious in present-day Bowie
County in 1719, and explored what is now Franklin County (Harper 2002). Benard de la Harpe’s
1719 trading post (which became known as the Nassonite Post) on the Red River north of
present-day Texarkana was the first European settlement in the Great Bend (Cooper et al. 2002;
Kelley and Coxe 1996:21). Another effort by Spain to curb French influence occurred in 1760,
when Fray Jose Francisco de Calahorra y Saenz led an expedition to present-day Rains County to
make peace with the Native American tribes in Northcentral Texas. These trading posts
eventually served as illicit trading centers between the two European colonies: modern-day
archeological investigations have yielded artifacts of Spanish and French origin that would
suggest that the different cultures interacted at the trading sites.
Following the sale of Louisiana to the United States in 1803, Anglo-American immigration into
North Texas intensified, although for a number of years it was not clear who actually owned the
area south of the Red River. The United States considered it (and indeed, most of Texas) to be
41

part of the Louisiana Purchase, and encouraged settlement of the area (Chandler and Howe 1939).
Spain (and later Mexico), on the other hand, was violently opposed to this view, and at several
times during the first few decades of the nineteenth century the dispute nearly led to war (Smith
1991). The first official Anglo-American penetration of the region was by the 1806 FreemanCustis Expedition, which was turned back at Spanish Bluffs, along the Red River, by a Spanish
military force (Flores 1984).
Despite Spain’s claim, North Texas was too close to the United States not to fall into the AngloAmerican sphere of influence, and settlement continued. The earliest settlements were confined
to the areas immediately adjacent to the Red River, but after 1818, settlement pushed into the
prairies along river tributaries and early roads such as Trammel’s Trace and Dayton’s Road.
Trammel’s Trace, a popular immigrant route into Texas after 1813, crossed the Sulphur River at
Epperson’s Ferry and continued southwestward through Cass County to Hughes Springs, founded
in 1839, and then south to cross Cypress Creek 2 miles west of modern-day Jefferson (Webb and
Carroll 1952:2:793–794). Dayton’s Road was a major east-west overland route that ran along the
divide between the Sulphur and Red rivers.
The original Anglo-American settlers in Texas were largely subsistence farmers residing on small
holdings, with an economy based on grain and livestock production (Peter and Cliff 1990a:36).
The commercial production of cotton apparently was not introduced until the 1830s (Fehrenbach
1968), a shift that was accompanied by increasing numbers of slaves in the region. The town of
Jefferson, on Cypress Creek, was a major cotton market, and the antebellum planters throughout
the region undoubtedly sent their cotton there for sale (Peter and Cliff 1990a:39). Other major
industries established about the same time included tan yards and syrup mills; after 1857, railroad
construction also progressed westward (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198, 2:59).
As settlers began to move into Texas, they remained under first Spanish and then Mexican control
until the struggle for Texas independence in 1836. For the most part, North Texas was beyond
the direct sphere of the conflict involving the fight for Texas independence: that conflict played
out primarily in South and Central Texas in 1835 and 1836. The most significant change
thereafter involved decrees by President Mirabeau Lamar, the second president of Texas, to make
the settlers of the Texas Republic safe from marauding Native Americans by adopting an Indian
removal or extermination program. Active efforts to drive off or exterminate the Native
Americans in North Texas had been under way for some time. In one instance in 1837, a group
of Texas Rangers under the command of Lt. A. B. Van Benthuysen camped on Turtle Creek after
conducting raids on Indians to the north (Maxwell 2002). Subsequently, many native groups who
used the Trinity River basin relocated north of the Red River.
Texas traded its independence for U.S. statehood in 1846, entering the union as the twenty-eighth
state, but did not remain a state for long. Sectarian politics were raised to a fever pitch during
that period, and after the presidential election of 1860, Texas began to consider secession. The
sympathies of most of the Anglo-American residents of North Texas lay with the secessionist
southerners; after all, a majority of them had immigrated from the South, the region as a whole
had a substantial slave population, and the cash economy of the area was built on slave-based
agriculture, even though most of the individual farmers could not afford to own slaves. In most
of Northeast and Northcentral Texas anti-Union feelings ran high (Webb and Carroll
1952:1:306), and nearly all the counties in the study area voted to secede—though some, like
Delta County, did support Sam Houston’s Unionist forces during the early part of the war
(McCroskey 1997). Eventually, Texas became a part of the hard-pressed Confederate States of
America.
42

Although the fighting never reached North Texas, the Civil War still inflicted hardships on the
region (Works Projects Administration [WPA] 1992:55–58). Because most able-bodied men
were away fighting for the Confederacy, most small towns and villages were left unprotected
from and fearful of Native American raids (Denton County History Page 2001). The result was
an eastward retreat of the frontier. Simultaneously, the region also experienced considerable
immigration of Southerners who were moving west to escape the warfare that ravaged the Deep
South. The region gradually became impoverished as the war progressed, when food and other
commodities became expensive and difficult to obtain (WPA 1992:55–58).
North Texas escaped serious, direct effects from the Civil War, being too far from the centers of
fighting to the east and south to be affected by Union forces, and too far east of the frontier to be
affected by the resurgence of Native American problems that accompanied the withdrawal of
U.S. and Texas military forces (Pool 1975:110-113). The defeat of the South in 1865 brought
with it the end of slavery in Texas, the breakdown of the old slave-based plantation system, and
the presence of a Union army of occupation. The end of slavery brought many changes in the
economy of rural North Texas. Lacking the cheap and dependable labor resources provided by
slavery, the large plantations of the prewar period ceased to be economically feasible and many
were broken up and partially sold off. Most of the land put on the market found its way into the
hands of speculators and investors, with the result that a new system of sharecropping or tenant
farming replaced the old plantation system. Productive land was now often held by absentee
landlords, with the labor supplied by African-American or poor Anglo-American sharecroppers
or tenants. Although this system failed to improve the lot of the sharecroppers and tenants, it was
a successful replacement for the prewar system, and by the beginning of the twentieth century,
the bulk of the rural farms in Northeast Texas were operated by sharecroppers or tenants.
The state re-entered the Union in 1877. After 1870, the population of North Texas began to
increase, and the region began to recover from the worst effects of the war and the subsequent
recession. One of the most important factors in this recovery was the increasing role of the
railroad in the regional economy. A small amount of railroad construction had occurred prior to
the outbreak of the war, when more than 50 miles of track had been laid westward from
Texarkana in 1857 by the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific Railroad. Following the end of the war,
construction did not resume for four more years. When it finally did, it continued at a relatively
steady rate. In 1871 and 1872, the Texas and Pacific Railroad went through the southern corner
of Upshur County and the eastern portion of Cass and Marion counties. In 1876, the East Line
and Red River Railroad (later part of the Louisiana and Arkansas), building west from Jefferson,
crossed western Marion County and the southwest portion of Cass County. In the piney woods of
northeastern Texas, the Houston, East and West Texas Railway from Houston to Shreveport was
completed in 1882, quickly followed by the Kansas and Gulf Short Line, the Texas Southeastern,
the Grovetop, Lufkin and Northern, the Texas and New Orleans, and the Angelina and Neches
River railroads. In 1901 the Gulf, Beaumont, and Great Northern Railroad as well as the St. Louis
and Southwestern Railway had completed lines through San Augustine County; and by 1902 the
Eastern Texas Railroad was operating from Lufkin to Kennard in southeastern Houston County,
thus connecting the northeastern counties and opening manufacturing/trade/transportation
opportunities.
New towns sprang up along these railroad routes and developed as important shipping centers
(Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306). The continuing expansion of the railroads after 1870, and the
improved communications they brought, spurred the development of other local industries as
well. The economic boom caused by the railroads brought many changes to Dallas and Fort
43

Worth, the two largest towns in the region, both of which were sited on the Trinity. During this
period, lumbering assumed its place as an important industry in many areas of the piney woods of
northeastern Texas (Chandler 1937). The Houston, East and West Texas Railway and the Gulf,
Beaumont, and Great Northern Railroad allowed transportation of lumber from timber-rich Polk,
Angelina, San Augustine, San Jacinto, Shelby, Trinity, and Nacogdoches counties. Sawmills to
process this lumber also sprang up throughout these Northeast Texas counties, especially in
Lufkin and Angelina County, which led to innovations for lumber and paper production, and
provided another major source of employment (Webb and Carroll 1952:2:824). These mills
helped supply raw material to factories located in Texarkana and in other large towns (Webb and
Carroll 1952:1:198).
Following the arrival of the railroads, colleges and universities soon made their way to Northeast
Texas. Central College, a Methodist institution, was established in 1881 (renamed Eastman
College in 1895) in Sulphur Springs, the county seat of Hopkins County (Jennings 2001). East
Texas Normal College, later renamed East Texas State University (and now known as Texas
A&M University–Commerce), was established in 1894 in Commerce, located 15 miles from
Greenville. Stephen F. Austin State University was founded in Nacogdoches in 1923. Numerous
universities, colleges, and branches thereof sprang up throughout the increasingly urban areas of
Dallas, Fort Worth, and Texarkana.
In spite of the steady growth in nonagricultural industries during these years, farming continued
to be important in Northeast Texas, with the small, owner-operated farm still prominent. Despite
the inequities of the sharecropper and tenant systems, the participants were not locked into the
system as had been the case under slavery, and in the last three decades of the nineteenth century
increasing numbers of African-Americans achieved the status of small landowners. They often
settled in dispersed rural communities separate from those of their white neighbors.
Between about 1920 and 1935, the rural population seems to have generally declined, although
the population of the region as a whole continued to grow (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:198). Some
factors that may have influenced this demographic shift were the continued growth of urban
industries, the declining agricultural productivity of the land, and the depressed regional and
national economy. The discovery of oil in many North Texas counties in the 1930s led to the
development of new industries and increased employment, although the overall population of the
region continued to fall (Webb and Carroll 1952:1:306, 2:144, 783).
The period following the end of World War II has been one of general prosperity and
urbanization for the entire region. Demographic changes within this area have been dominated
by the growth of medium-sized urban areas such as Texarkana and Marshall, and larger urban
areas like the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, which has swallowed many lesser
municipalities between and surrounding the city centers. Commercial patterns in the region have
benefited from the construction of several major interstate highways (IH 20 and IH 30) that have
served to link the area to major manufacturing centers to both the east and the west. The
improved infrastructure, as well as the construction of several lakes in the area, also has brought
increased prosperity in the form of tourism and the recreational dollar. In spite of this growth,
agriculture and livestock continue to play a major role in the regional economy (Fox 1980:1). In
the piney woods area, the timber industry remains perhaps the major industry. The forests of the
area, along with lumber and paper production, have also created a significant tourist industry.
The Angelina National Forest is a major tourist attraction in Nacogdoches and San Augustine
counties, and San Augustine and Shelby counties are the site of the 188,000-acre Sabine National
44

Forest. The Old Stone Fort and Sam Rayburn Reservoir bring additional income to Nacogdoches,
and Toledo Bend, which borders Shelby County, is a major recreational facility. In Sabine
County, the Indian Mounds Wilderness area is administered by the United States Forest Service
and, along with timbering, produces substantial revenues.

CHAPTER 4
SUMMARY OF IMPACT EVALUATIONS AND SURVEYS

The current contract for the five TxDOT districts of Atlanta, Dallas, Lufkin, Paris, and Tyler
(Figures 6 through 10) involved three impact evaluations and 19 survey work authorizations.
These work authorizations, composed of multiple CSJ numbers, were for one airport extension,
six bridge replacements with road realignment/road widening projects, four road-widening
projects, one bank stabilization project, three new construction projects, an evaluation of postreview discovery of three possible sites, five safety end treatments, and a transportation
enhancement project. During the course of executing these work authorizations, 28 archeological
sites were discovered or revisited. In the following section, the research methodology, findings,
and recommendations of the completed work authorizations will be summarized. Subsequently,
the data and recommendations for the discovered and revisited sites will be covered in detail.
Finally, the utility of the methodology employed will be reviewed, and recommendations for
future work will be made.

METHODOLOGY
Upon receipt of a work authorization under this contract, background research was conducted
prior to initiation of fieldwork. First, the appropriate 7.5 minute U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic quadrangle map(s) was consulted for the given project area. An evaluation of the
construction plans, when available, was made to determine areas of possible impact by the
planned work. A file search was conducted for known sites within a radius of 0.5 mile (mi;
0.8 km) of the project area. These file searches were conducted at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) and online at the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas website. An
examination of the appropriate Bureau of Economic Geology map and U.S. Department of
Agriculture soil survey was then conducted to place the project area in the proper geological and
pedological contexts. The Texas Historic Overlay: A Geographic Information System of Historic
Map Images for Planning Transportation Projects in Texas (Foster et al. 2006) was also
consulted prior to fieldwork (for projects initiated after the map overlay’s distribution) to
determine the presence of any historic resources mapped in the project area. Once the work
authorization specifics were known and the proper background research was completed, the
researcher was prepared to formulate an appropriate field methodology.

47

The specifications of the work authorization are critical in the determination of a suitable research
strategy. For this particular contract, the work authorizations were broken down into two macrocategories: archeological impact evaluations and archeological surveys. The two categories can
be broken down further by the type of proposed transportation-related project they fall under,
such as new construction, road widening and/or realignment, bridge and/or relief structure
replacement, or a combination of these categories.
The three impact evaluations (three CSJs) undertaken for work authorizations under this contract
concerned road widening, new construction, and safety treatments. The environmental settings of
these projects ranged from highly disturbed urban and residential locations to undisturbed rural
areas. Upon arrival in the project area, an orientation drive-through of the entire project APE was
undertaken to physically acquaint the investigator(s) with the local settings. After becoming
familiar with the project, a low-speed visual inspection was made by auto, noting disturbances
such as utilities installations, cut-and-fill sections, and highly eroded areas. In addition to the
knowledge of the project area’s geology, pedology, and construction plans, the visual inspection
allowed the investigator(s) to evaluate the sections of the project area that should be inspected by
pedestrian survey. Settings that the investigator(s) determined to have potential to contain
archeological deposits were visually inspected on foot. Such settings included areas in flood
plains of nonintermittent streams, landforms overlooking watersheds, upland areas with
noneroded soils, and areas with potential for historic-age structures or sites. In addition, areas in
proximity to recorded archeological sites that occurred outside the project area were also visually
inspected for surface expression of cultural resources.
All observations for road
widening/realignment or new construction impact evaluations were noted in daily journal entries.
Notations of disturbances and machinery access locations and sites discovered or revisited were
recorded on the appropriate field maps. Photographic records were made of the general project
area and of any sites or localities discovered or revisited.
Of the 19 work authorizations (27 CSJs) involving archeological surveys, 13 (16 CSJs) were
performed for projects that involved road widening, realignment, new road construction,
transportation enhancements, bank stabilizations, airport expansion, or a combination of these.
Again, the environmental settings ranged from urban to rural areas. In addition to the research
material consulted for both impact evaluations and archeological surveys, the investigator(s) for
archeological surveys generally had access to the appropriate impact evaluation report for the
project area. The impact evaluation reports made recommendations for portions of the project
area that required additional investigations beyond what had been completed in the impact
evaluation. The recommendations usually designated areas where additional shovel testing or
backhoe trenching should be conducted to identify the presence or absence of archeological sites.
Most surveys for this type of work authorization dealt with linear survey swaths where
undisturbed soils were more likely to occur. In zones where necessary, shovel tests were placed
either at 30-m (98.4-ft) intervals or judgmentally along the recommended zone. Shovel tests were
30 cm (11.8 in) in diameter and typically excavated in 20-cm (7.9-in) levels to a depth of 80 cm
(31.5 in). In some cases, pre-Holocene clays prevented the excavation from reaching an 80-cm
depth. Shovel tests were terminated once the Bt-horizon was encountered. Soil recovered from
shovel test units was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) metal hardware cloth in wood or
plastic frames to determine if artifacts were present. All shovel test units were recorded on a
standardized form and plotted on the appropriate field map.

53

Six work authorizations (11 CSJs) for archeological surveys were performed for projects that
involved replacement of bridge structures and/or relief structures (four associated also with road
widenings and/or realignments). Survey of the bridge areas generally was carried out in less than
5 acres around the existing structures. Since the project areas were usually in flood plain
locations with recent Holocene alluvial deposits, mechanical excavation of backhoe trench (BHT)
units was conducted at most project areas. Bridge/relief structure surveys also required shovel
testing, using the same methods described above. The shovel test excavations were carried out on
new or existing ROW areas of bridge/relief structure approaches. Again, all test excavations
(backhoe trenches and shovel tests) were plotted on the project plans and/or field maps, and all
backhoe trenches were photographically recorded.
During previous impact evaluations associated with surveys, mechanically excavated BHT test
units were recommended for specific flood plains and other areas that had the possibility of
containing deep, undisturbed cultural deposits. Trenches were excavated for 11 work
authorizations (17 CSJs). The depths of the BHT units ordinarily ranged from 1 to 2 m (3.3–
6.6 ft) with widths that varied between 1 and 1.5 m (3.3–4.9 ft), depending on the size of the
bucket of the particular machine employed. During the process of excavating the BHT units, a
sample of the backdirt was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) metal hardware cloth in a wood
or plastic frame, and observations of the excavations were made to determine if archeological
deposits were encountered. The range in length of the BHT units varied between 3 and 17 m
(9.8–55.7 ft) depending on the particular setting of the excavation; the majority of the trenches
were greater than 5 m long. After completion of the BHT unit excavation, the unit profile was
inspected for cultural deposits and the soil matrix was described and recorded photographically.
The placement of BHT units was made judgmentally by the investigator(s) to provide the most
extensive coverage of the recommended survey area.

• Paris District: two surveys involving one road widening and one safety treatment.
• Tyler District: one survey involving a bridge replacement with road realignment/widening.
The four remaining completed work authorizations involved one archival review in the Atlanta
District; and two scopes of work development and one testing project in the Dallas District. In
addition to these 26 efforts, two work authorizations were cancelled before initiation of
fieldwork, and the final work authorization consisted of the development and preparation of this
report, for a total of 29 work authorizations under this contract.

IMPACTS AND SITE POTENTIAL
One of the principal concerns of both impact assessments and surveys is the identification of
archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16.[1]) and State Archeological Landmarks (SALs;
13 TAC 26.12). Disturbances, whether natural or man-made (Table 3), diminish the possibility of
finding such properties. In the impact evaluation phase, evaluating disturbances can assist in
identifying areas where further survey is not necessary. Conversely, identifying areas possessing
a high potential for containing archeological historic properties or SALs is facilitated by an
awareness of the effects of disturbance. Whether classified as man-made fill, man-made cut, or
naturally occurring, certain disturbances occur in existing ROWs with such frequency that it is
possible to form a few generalized observations regarding their extent and effect on the
landscape.
Cut-and-fill episodes occur when a road or bridge approach is elevated above the flood plain. Fill
for the road berm is often obtained from the margins within the ROW and deposited in the center
of the ROW. The result is a raised road berm bordered by depressed areas, which function to
facilitate drainage runoff. If the slope at the junction of the terrace above the flood plain with the
road or bridge is steep or sudden, a road cut is sometimes utilized to lessen the incline without
raising the road higher. For roads situated parallel with the slope, a road cut on the high side of
the slope is sometimes necessary for a level road. Fill from the road cut may be deposited on the
low side, or used elsewhere. At the immediate junction of the road or bridge with the terrace, a
variety of methods can be employed to hold the shoulders in place against erosion. These can
include concrete or stone aprons or less formally designed sheet metal or wooden aprons.
Road berms are generally 1–3 m in height on narrow rural roads, but can be up to 5–6 m in height
on major highways or over wide flood plains. The extent of the raised berm shoulders can be
quite wide, ranging from 10 m, the limits of the ROW on narrow, one-lane, rural roads, to 20–23
m on larger roads. Borrow areas or drainage ditches are approximately 0.5–1.0 m deep on
smaller roads, but can extend up to 1.5 m. Both trenching and shovel testing reveal that
disturbances from earth-working equipment can extend 0.5 m and deeper.
Underground utilities are typically placed outside the limits of road berms, near the margins of
the ROW, and can be stacked vertically, or spaced horizontally. Telephone, fiber optic, and
electrical lines can be laid shallowly in narrow trenches of approximately 1 m in width. Fiber
optic cables are laid farthest from the road, usually at the outer edge of the ROW and outside of
older phone and electric cables. In addition, gas and water lines exposed at stream crossings have
been observed at depths of over 4 m. Sewer and fire hydrant as well as gas and water line
placement is a consideration in residential and industrial areas, though these are not typically

marked. Aboveground utility transmission lines are typically placed toward the margins of the
ROW. Within any given ROW, it is possible that 1–3 m of horizontal utility installation
disturbances exist.
Because of their association with flood plains, many of these project areas would naturally
undergo depositional processes due to periodic alluviation. Man-made disturbances, however,
exacerbate the natural effects of erosion by altering drainage patterns. Bridge aprons, road berms,
and drainage ditches channel rain runoff through the ROW, causing intense erosion of surface
soils, cutbanks, and terrace edges adjacent to these features. The barbed-wire fence, a common
feature in rural areas, traps debris in its mesh, which hinders surface water from draining into
contiguous areas. Another trap along creeks is the wire or slat and wire “fence” strung across a
creek to trap large debris at bridges and culverts. The backup of large debris tends to cause
extensive erosion at the edges of bridges or culverts compromising the structure as well as the
road crossing it. Utility trenches are typically backfilled with the original matrix, and these
loosened soils erode quickly in areas of heightened runoff.
Other disturbances, which have been observed in existing ROWs as well as the adjacent areas and
therefore have the potential to be located in new ROWs, are usually associated with residential,
commercial, or rural development. In residential areas, improvements can include landscaping,
improved drainages, culvert driveways, curb cuts, and construction. Commercial improvements
that have been encountered in project areas have been railroad beds, dams and their associated
reservoirs, berms, clear cutting, and trash dumping. In rural areas, evidence of plowing, logging,
ranching, and stock pond construction is apparent. Also note that the first stage of
highway/bridge construction consists of vegetation removal by bulldozer in order to remove both
trees and roots.

CHAPTER 5
SITE INVESTIGATIONS

Twenty-eight archeological sites or plotted site locations were investigated during the execution
of this contract. Because the scope of work for testing 41DL203 was prepared under this
contract, this site has been included although no fieldwork was conducted; testing was initiated
under a separate contract.. Descriptions of these sites and recommendations for treatment are
drawn from the original work authorization reports and are summarized in Table 4.

SITE 41AG180 (WA 26)

Previous Investigations
Site 41AG180, was recorded within the current APE, by Horizon ESI, on a sandy knoll on the
west bank of Peach Creek, adjacent to Kit McConnico Park during the survey of a 17-acre annex
for the McConnico Park commissioned by the City of Lufkin in 2002 (Brownlow 2002). Site
41AG180 was reported to be delineated by Peach Creek to the east, a small drainage and
transmission line to the north, a fence line and railroad tracks to the south, and Loop 287 to the
west. The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas depiction of the site location shows the apparent
location of the shovel tests adjacent to the top bank of Peach Creek, about 100 m from the edge of
Loop 287, but with a much larger assumed site area drawn along the 260-ft contour line that
extends to Loop 287. The material recovered from three of four shovel tests at 41AG180 in 2002
included silicified wood debitage, sandy paste ceramics, bone, and charcoal, below historic glass,
metal, and whiteware. Cultural material extended at least 1 m in depth. The site was assessed as
having potential for both NRHP listing and SAL designation.

Current Investigations
Geo-Marine, Inc., archeologists conducted fieldwork on September 4 and 5, 2007, within the new
proposed ROW in an attempt to document previously recorded site 41AG180. The site is located
in a cleared pasture owned by Angelina & Neches River Railroad and bounded to the west by
Loop 287 North, to the south by the railroad tracks, to the north by a transmission line, and to the
east by Peach Creek. The geology of the area is Eocene Yegua Formation and the mapped soils

are Alazan very fine sandy loam, 0 to 4% slopes, and Alazan-Urban land complex, 0 to 4% slopes
(Dolezel 1988). The profile from Shovel Test 1, in approximately the middle of the original
mapped site boundary and within the current APE, consisted of 0–19 cm of dark yellowish brown
(10YR 4/4 dry) silty clay loam with organic material, over 19–60 cm bs of dark yellowish brown
(10YR 4/6 dry) sandy loam, over 60–70 cm bs of light brownish gray (10YR 6/2 dry) silty clay
with abundant redoximorphic iron features. Within the existing ROW, the primary vegetation is
regularly maintained (mown) grass and associated forbs. The proposed ROW consists mainly of
recently clear-cut pine forest with secondary vegetation of tall grasses and weeds.

69

GMI archeologists excavated five mechanical trenches and four 50-x-50-cm shovel tests within
the extended site area within the proposed highway ROW. All of the shovel tests and trenches
were excavated within the privately owned pasture. No cultural material was recovered from any
of the trenches or shovel tests; however, 27 pieces of petrified wood, 32 small rounded gravel,
and 13 pieces of ironstone pebbles were recovered during these investigations. None of this
material exhibited signs of cultural modification. The originally reported boundary of site
41AG180 appeared to be incorrect, as it was based on only three shovel tests and then expanded
to include an entire landform with no supporting data and insufficient site delineation. As a result
of these investigations, it was determined that no portion of site 41AG180 extended into the
existing or proposed ROW. No additional investigations within the APE were recommended.

SITE 41AG194 (WA 20)

Current Investigations
Site 41AG194 is a newly recorded site demonstrating both historic and prehistoric components
and was identified in Parcel 1 approximately 100 m northeast of the Neches River on a low-lying
terrace. The primary feature of the historic component is a rectangular wooden building that
appears to date to the early half of the twentieth century. It occurs approximately 45 m south of
the existing SH 94 ROW and about 20 m south (outside) of the proposed project APE.
The underlying geology of the site consists of Holocene alluvial deposits (BEG 1993). The soils
consist of Ozias-Pophers complex, 0 to 1 percent slopes, frequently flooded (Dolezel 1988). Soil
profiles were generally consistent and consisted of 5–40 cm of brown (10YR 4/3) fine sandy
loam above a strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam that extended to the bottom of the
units—usually 80 cm bs. Vegetation consists of regularly maintained (mown) grasses, wetland
vegetation, pine forest interspersed with oak and sweet gum trees and shrubs.
The wooden building was constructed with wire nails, has a corrugated metal roof, and measures
roughly 18 m east to west. The east half is approximately 4 m wide north to south and contains
an electric stove and a few pieces of furniture. A fuse box dangles from the north side of this
portion. Two strips of corrugated metal are nailed to the west end of the building, possibly
covering old windows. The west half is about a meter wider and is partially collapsed under a
fallen tree. An abandoned refrigerator is visible in this area, but this segment of the house
appears to have functioned primarily for storage purposes based on the windows, which are
covered with screen but lack glass panes unlike the east half of the structure.
Although the structure was examined, subsurface investigations were restricted to the APE north
of the structure. Twenty-two shovel tests were excavated in Parcel 1, private property east of the
Neches River, and two additional shovel tests were placed in the existing ROW directly north of
the property (Figure 11). Shovel tests within the proposed ROW typically consisted of a brown
or dark grayish brown fine sandy loam surface layer that graded into dark yellowish brown fine
sandy loam and eventually to strong brown clayey sand. Two shovel tests were excavated in the
existing ROW and revealed a much different profile: ST 23 and ST 24 (both with modern bottle
glass, asphalt, and gravel; 0–60 cm bs) demonstrated a much more complex, stratified profile that
likely represents different layers of fill deposited when the highway was constructed.

70

Historic artifacts possibly associated with occupation of the building were identified in several
shovel tests: a piece of blue-tinted white whiteware (1880–1930); a 17-cm-long piece of rebar
and pieces of metal similar to the corrugated metal on the structure; several fragments of clear
and brown machine-made bottle glass (post 1910), four wire nails (post-1890), including a 6-inch
spike; window glass; a .22-caliber shell (post-1859); a crown bottle cap (post-1905); and several
asphalt pieces. Surficial material consisted of a metal rod of unknown function approximately 3
ft in length; refuse of glass bottles, metal cans, and plastic bottles around the structure and within
the APE (dating from the early or middle 1900s to the present); and the remnants of a cast-iron
highway torch or smudge pot (used by highway departments between the 1920s and 1970s as a
warning signal to motorists [Vandercook 2007] and thus more likely related to construction of SH
94 than to activities associated with the structure).
The prehistoric component of the site was clustered in the northcentral part of the site.
Subsurface material consisted of four pieces of pottery, several pieces of silicified wood shatter,
and chert and quartzite flakes, all stratigraphically below the historic material.
The historic component of 41AG194 was determined to be fairly recent and multiple occupations
and/or dumping episodes had compromised the contextual integrity of the site. The building was
outside the APE and would not be impacted by the proposed project. The prehistoric component
within the APE appeared sparse; however, the materials identified tended to occur in relatively
deep contexts. Although several shovel tests were excavated as deeply as possible (> 100 cm bs)
in this area (backhoe trenches not allowed) and the prehistoric materials appeared to be primarily
circumscribed between 60–80 cm bs, more deeply buried archeological materials could be present
because of the alluvial setting. Therefore, additional investigation was recommended once the
state obtained Parcel 1 to determine whether the artifact deposit observed represented a lowdensity scatter or overlay a deeper, more significant component. Recent trenching by TxDOT,
after acquisition of the land parcel within the APE, confirmed the sparse nature of archeological
material within highly bioturbated soils. No additional work within the APE was recommended,
and THC concurred that the portion of the site within the proposed ROW was not eligible for
lising in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.

SITE 41AN162 (WA 5)

Previous Investigations
A member of the Texas Archeological Stewardship Network originally recorded the site in 2003;
however, the site location is not plotted on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas and despite two
separate conversations with the property owner, Mr. Archie Stivner, he never mentioned any
previous archeological investigations on the property. Rather, he stated that although he assumed
that archeological materials would be present on the property given its proximity to 41AN19, he
has never seen any artifacts (Archie Stivner, personal communications 26 and 28 July 2006).
Consequently, current investigators were unaware of the presence of a recorded site potentially
within the project APE. The original site form lists the site centroid coordinates as being farther
north and east of those derived from the present survey. However, the original investigator did
not shovel test the area to delineate the site’s boundaries, and the present survey was limited to
the project APE. Furthermore, the general location and types of artifacts observed in 2003 (a
subsurface petrified wood flake; and surface material of historic whiteware and colorless bottle
72

glass, and approximately 10 prehistoric sherds) are consistent with material recovered currently,
and TARL is considering the site reported under the present investigation to be an extension of
41AN19.

Current Investigations
The site is located on the north side of US 175 immediately west of a large, fairly level terrace,
where the landform begins to slope toward the Neches River, which is directly to the east. A
natural spring occurs south of the site on the south side of US 175, and 41AN19 lies
approximately 250 m to the northwest. The underlying geology is the Eocene Weches Formation
as well as Holocene alluvium, and the mapped soil is Elrose fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent
slopes (Coffee 1975). Shovel tests rarely extended deeper than 40 cm below surface (bs) and
consisted of reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) compact fine sandy loam above yellowish red (5YR 5/8)
compact sandy clay. The eastern fifth of the survey area demonstrated up to 50 cm of light brown
(7.5YR 6/4) fine sandy loam with hematite gravels above a similar subsoil. The vegetation
consists of grass with scattered mature pine and hardwoods; hardwoods are along the east and
southeast fence lines.
Cultural materials were identified in seven shovel tests immediately west of the beginning of the
slope toward the river (Figure 12). Artifacts consisted of five pieces of plain prehistoric pottery,
one fragment of incised prehistoric pottery, one petrified wood flake, five chert flakes, one piece
of historic glass, and two historic ceramic fragments. Artifact density was generally low in the
portion of the site that falls within project APE, and positive units typically only produced a
single flake or piece of pottery. No artifacts were collected in accordance with the wishes of the
property owner.
Despite the fact that site 41AN162 has some contextual integrity inconsistencies, it is located near
the east end of the top of a large terrace overlooking the Neches River to the east, and it is
approximately 250–300 m southeast of 41AN19, an SAL-designated and NRHP-listed Caddo
site. A natural spring also occurs south of the site on the opposite side of US 175. Therefore, the
potential for subsurface features exists, and further investigation was recommended.

SITE 41AN173 (WA 5)

Current Investigations
The site occurs on the north side of US 175, approximately 800 m north of Caddo Creek on a
gentle, south-facing slope of a terrace that overlooks the stream. It is presently a vacant,
overgrown field with grasses, blackberry and other brush, hardwoods along fence lines and a
stand at the northern boundary on the east end, and a pile of modern asphalt shingles dumped in
the southwest corner. The underlying geology of the area is the Eocene Queen City Sand
formation. The mapped soil is Elrose fine sandy loam, 3 to 8 percent slopes (Coffee 1975),
although the soils in the shovel tests typically consisted of 15 to 60 cm of reddish yellow (7.5YR
6/6) fine sandy loam, often containing hematite gravels, above strong brown (7.5 YR 5/8)
compact sandy clay loam.

73

Initially, two transects were shovel-tested, and three units each produced one to two tertiary chert
flakes in the upper 30 cm (Figure 13). Due to the distribution of the positive shovel tests (two at
the southeast corner and one in the northwest end), a third transect was excavated to the north.
Although this transect was later determined to be outside the APE, two pieces of prehistoric
pottery nevertheless were identified along this transect in the easternmost shovel test at 30 cm bs.
Only one artifact was encountered in subsequent delineation shovel tests excavated around the
positive units. A shovel test, limited to 5 m south of Transect A, ST 2, by the property fence,
yielded a single chert flake in the upper 20 cm. No artifacts were collected in accordance with
the wishes of the property owner.
The three positive shovel tests near the southeast corner of the survey area are clustered within a
radius of approximately 25 m and have been designated as site 41AN173; the two more remote
units are considered isolated finds. It is likely that the site once extended beyond its present
limits but has largely been destroyed by plowing, the construction of US 175 to the immediate
south, and residential structures on the south side of the highway.
The majority of site 41AN173 probably existed in this vicinity but has since been heavily
disturbed. The low artifact density and the compromised contextual integrity from the impacts of
plowing and construction resulted in very limited research potential, and thus Geo-Marine
recommended no additional work. within the current APE. However, because of the potential for
subsurface features, TxDOT has proposed additional investigation (scraping) once the land parcel
has been acquired.

SITE 41CE404 (WA 5)

Current Investigations
The site occurs midway along the elevation of a ridge north of US 175 and about 850 meters west
of the west branch of Gum Creek. A natural spring is located approximately 700 m to the west,
on a neighboring property. Gas and petroleum pipelines cross the survey area approximately 20
m southeast of the site boundary, an overhead utility crosses the site northeast–southwest, and a
partially paved driveway borders the western site of the site. The underlying geology of the area
is the Eocene Queen City Sand. The mapped soils are Cuthbert and Ruston fine sandy loam,
strongly sloping (30 percent); Eustis loamy fine sand, strongly sloping (30 percent); Ruston and
Bowie loamy fine sands, strongly sloping (10 percent); Nacogdoches fine sandy loam, sloping
(10 percent) (Mowery 1959). Typical soils in the shovel tests in the east half of the survey area,
however, characteristically consisted of pink (7.5YR 7/3–8/3) gravelly fine sandy loam that
progressively became more compact with depth but extended beyond 80 cm bs. Soils on the west
side were generally composed of 40 to 60 cm of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly fine
sand above reddish brown (5YR 4/6) compact sand. Vegetation consists of grasses and pine
seedlings flanked by a mixed pine and hardwood forest with thick underbrush.
Site 41CE404 consists of a 540-square-meter, low-density concentration of tertiary stone flakes.
The APE was investigated in two transects starting from the east end (Figure 14). Initial shovel
test intervals were set at 50 m because of the sloping terrain, thick vegetation, and deadfall. A
low-density lithic deposit (site 41CE404) was identified approximately midway along the survey
area, and once the site was delineated and transect shovel testing resumed, intervals were reduced
75

to 30 m. Site 41CE404 was first encountered when a chert flake was recovered from ST 2 of
Transect B at approximately 40 cm bs in a clearing of grass and pine seedlings between two
densely wooded areas. Another flake was identified 60 cm bs in a shovel test 10 m east of the
first positive unit, and three were recovered at 50 cm bs 10 m south of ST B2. A shovel test 10 m
west of the first positive unit produced seven flakes between 20 and 60 cm bs. The site was
originally thought to extend an additional 15 m north with a possible flake recovered between 0
and 20 cm bs from a shovel test west of the driveway inside a forested area. However, the
property owner permitted collection of artifacts and later examination of the object indicated that
it was not a flake. Additional delineation shovel tests were sterile, and the overall area
demonstrates disturbances. Overhead power lines extend roughly north-south across the site, and
a two-track access road for the power line and pipeline easements that cross the survey area
extends east from the driveway across the site. A pushpile of dirt and rubble was also observed
southwest of a delineation shovel test 20 m south of ST B2.
The general site area has been cleared to access overhead and buried utility easements, and the
pushpile of debris is located about 15 m south of the site. A driveway for a residence also
extends along the west side of the site, although no artifacts were identified in shovel tests west of
the driveway. Site 41CE404 demonstrates limited research potential because of the surrounding
disturbances and sparseness of the artifact deposit. Consequently, no further work was
recommended within the APE.

SITE 41CE405 (WA 5)

Current Investigations
Site 41CE405 is in an area that extends along a prominent terrace on the north side of US 175,
approximately 500 m north of a tributary of Jordan Creek. The majority of the site occurs along
the south slope of the terrace, although a small portion extends along the upper part of the
landform as well. The underlying geology of the area is the Eocene Sparta Sand and Weches
Formation. The mapped soils consist of Bub-Nacogdoches complex (52 percent); Bowie loamy
fine sand, gently sloping (38 percent); and Lakeland loamy fine sand, nearly level (10 percent)
(Mowery 1959). The soils in the shovel tests generally consisted of 10 to 30 cm of light
yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly fine sandy loam above 10 to 20 cm of brownish yellow
(10YR 6/6) extremely gravelly and compact fine sandy loam. Subsoil was a strong brown
(7.5YR 5/8) clayey sandy loam. The vegetation consists of grasses and an immature hardwood
forest containing a few mature cedar and live oak trees.
The area was traversed in four 20-m transects due to landowner reports of possible Caddo
mounds or burial sites on the property. Initially, shovel tests were spaced at 20-m intervals;
however, the level of effort was reduced to surface inspection after several units indicated
disturbance. Portions of Transects C and D extended across the top of the landform at the eastern
half of the APE where intact soils were present, and shovel testing resumed at 30-m intervals. No
artifacts were identified in these shovel tests (Figure 15). However, site 41CE405 was discovered
on the basis of three above-ground features. Feature 1 is on the top of the landform south of a
barbed wire fence and is hidden in a cluster of saplings. The feature, the remnants of a historic
building, is a partially collapsed, sandstone and mortar, square structure, approximately 2-x-2 m
with a corrugated metal roof and wooden roof supports held together with wire nails. Transect D
78

extended approximately 10 m south of the structure, but no artifacts were identified in the shovel
tests. However, one shovel test each was excavated 5 m east, west, and south of the structure. A
.22 caliber rimfire cartridge was recovered from the upper 20 cm of the western shovel test. No
additional shovel tests were excavated due to the paucity of artifacts and because it was suspected
that the structure fell outside the project APE, which later proved to be true. Feature 2, a midden
of glass tumblers, bottles, snuff bottles, canning jars, and medicine bottles, is about 65 m
southeast of Feature 1 as the landform begins to slope southward and is immediately within the
north tree line of the forested area that extends across the south face of the APE. Feature 3 is an
intact brick well, approximately 1 m in diameter, also on the south slope of the ridge, roughly 75
m southwest of the stone structure. The exterior is plastered with mortar, and the top has been
covered with metal. Metal cans, metal buckets, and glass bottles are scattered along the south
slope around Features 2 and 3.
A residential structure occurs about 150 m west of the stone structure, but its style does not
appear to predate the 1950s, and it is likely not associated with the well or building. Intact soils
are only present along the top of the ridge within the survey area, and despite a transect of shovel
tests roughly 10 m south of the structure, only one subsurface artifact was recovered. The
structure occurs north of the limits of the project APE, and investigations north of the structure
were not possible. The sides of the ridge consist of degrading ironstone. Consequently, all
cultural materials in this area were on the ground surface. Artifacts included a concentration of
glass vessels that likely date no earlier than 1925, as well as metal cans, metal buckets, and glass
bottles scattered along the south slope. Modern trash, consisting of guttering, window screen
mesh, and a vinyl awning or tablecloth, is intermixed with the scatter. The recent date of the
features and artifacts, the lack of contextual integrity due to repeated dumping episodes, and the
absence of intact, buried cultural deposits indicate a limited research potential for the site, and
thus no further archeological work within the APE was recommended. However, archival
investigation to determine the antiquity and possible residents of the house site at 41CE405 was
suggested.

SITE 41COL172 (WA 12)

Previous Investigations
Site 41COL172 is located on the southern bank of Muddy Creek and lies within the newly
proposed ROW associated with the widening and realignment of FM 1378 in Collin County. The
previous investigations conducted on this site initially included a combination of pedestrian
survey and shovel testing (Sills et al. 2005). The pedestrian survey and 26 shovel tests conducted
within the proposed realignment ROW for FM 1378 failed to identify any cultural remains or
reach subsoil. Therefore, it was decided that an adjusted strategy of excavating exploratory
archeological trenches would be undertaken to (1) evaluate the potential for in situ burial of
archeological deposits, and (2) search for buried archeological sites and evaluate the potential
effects of the proposed project on them. Two backhoe trenches were excavated on either side of
the existing Muddy Creek channel, as close to the creek as possible (Sills et al. 2005:6). Trenches
on the north side of the creek were culturally sterile, but faunal material consisting of deer and
possibly bison was found in the backdirt of both trenches on the southern bank of Muddy Creek.
The majority of the faunal material appeared to be located near the interface of the recent alluvial
deposits and the underlying buried soil, and some of the fragments appeared to possess “pot
80

polish” or the sheen often found on bones that have been boiled in ceramic vessels. Charcoal
flecks and pieces of mussel shell were also observed in the backdirt from these trenches. These
materials alone failed to provide convincing evidence of past cultural behavior, because they
could represent the byproduct of natural taphonomic processes. Nevertheless, given the potential
that the materials could be the result of cultural behavior, researchers recommended additional
work be conducted to assess fully the potential of the site (Sills et al. 2005:1–13).

Current Investigations
GMI returned to site 41COL172 on 18–22 November 2006 in an attempt to assess further the
research potential and eligibility of the site for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an
SAL. Site 41COL172 represents a discrete single-component Late Prehistoric site with
incredibly high rates of preservation. The presence of a single ceramic sherd attributable to the
type Pennington Punctated-Incised has provided a tentative date range of roughly A.D. 1000–
1200.
The underlying geology of the site is Holocene alluvium and the mapped soils are Trinity clay,
occasionally flooded (Hanson and Wheeler 1969), with a typical profile of 0 to 6 inches of very
dark gray (5Y 3/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) dry, moderate fine and medium granular and
moderate fine subangular blocky structure; above 6 to 16 inches of very dark gray (5Y 3/1) clay,
dark gray (5Y 4/1) dry, moderate medium subangular blocky structure; above 16 to 36 inches of
very dark gray (5Y 3/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) dry, weak fine and very fine subangular blocky
structure; above 36 to 64 inches of very dark gray (5Y 3/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) dry, weak
coarse blocky structure; common fine and medium distinct olive yellow (5Y 6/6) and yellowish
brown (10YR 5/8) redox concentrations; 64 to 75 inches; dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) clay, olive
gray (5Y 4/2) dry; weak coarse angular blocky structure; common fine and medium distinct olive
yellow (2.5Y 6/6; 5Y 6/8) and few coarse distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) redox
concentrations. The vegetation in the area is predominantly grassland with scattered clusters of
trees, with the greatest concentration of trees along the drainages.
GMI excavated six test trenches to further observe and document the geological setting of the
site. Once these profiles were investigated, GMI archeologists placed one 50-x-50-cm test
excavation unit off the edge of each trench to recover a representative sample of the cultural
material present in the cultural-bearing deposits. The cultural zone was encountered below the
modern alluvial deposits at an average depth of 1.3 m bs. The distinction between the overlying
modern alluvial deposits and the underlying cultural-bearing deposits was demarcated by an
easily identifiable unconformity. The cultural zone was roughly 70 cm thick. The depth of the
trenches was extended as a precautionary measure, ensuring the trenches extended deep enough
to fully expose the cultural-bearing layer.
Each trench position was documented using global positioning system (GPS) readings, and these
points were collected at both ends of the long axis of each trench and at the center point of the test
unit. Once the trenches were established and the overburden stripped from the location where the
test unit was to be located, GMI archeologists laid out 50-x-50-cm units with one side open to the
trench profile. These units were then excavated in 10-cm arbitrary levels with all excavated
materials screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth. These units were excavated to 10 cm below
the cultural-bearing layers or until it was obvious excavations had entered the AC horizon.

81

The horizontal extent of site 41COL172 is largely unknown because testing has been restricted to
the newly proposed ROW. The site is confirmed to be roughly 365 square meters, but assumed to
be larger. The northern portion of this site shares a northern boundary with the southern bank of
Muddy Creek. The remaining boundaries are hypothesized to be outlined by the paleochannel of
Muddy Creek. The eastern boundary of the site is associated with Trench E, and the western
boundary is assumed to extend beyond the present ROW. The southern boundary is also marked
by Trench E, because the evidence from Trench F is likely the result of natural processes rather
than cultural. Thus, in effect, the paleochannel of Muddy Creek marks the edge of an in situ
former terrace composed of West Fork soil. If this hypothesis is true, then the site extends to the
west and increases the aerial extent of site 41COL172 to 770 square meters.
The total number of artifacts recovered from the site is 541, with the vast majority of these
specimens being faunal material. The test units yielded 11 pieces of burned clay/earth, 175 bone
fragments, 87 shell fragments, 30 specimens of charcoal, 10 pieces of debitage, and 9 fire-cracked
rock (FCR). A total of 13 pieces of burned clay/earth was recovered during excavation. The 30
pieces of charcoal were collected from Test Unit 2, but no other unit produced charcoal. The
remainder of the material came from backhoe excavations.
A total of 379 bones was analyzed from this site. The most commonly identified faunal remains
from the site were 195 bones attributed to white-tailed deer. Eighteen bison bones were also
identified within the assemblage. The number of identifiable remains is greatly reduced in the
next tier of identifiable remains; there were two fragments of a rabbit-sized mammal, one fish
bone, one bone from a rat, one bone from a snake, and 21 fragments of multiple types of turtles.
Skeletal elements from three fish and three birds were thought to be part of the background static
associated with the natural setting of the site. The remaining specimens were unidentifiable
fragments.
The lithic assemblage from the site was composed of nine flakes, two pieces of shatter, two
pieces of red ochre, and 12 pieces of FCR. All lithic debitage specimens are byproducts from the
manufacture of stone tools from locally undifferentiated cherts commonly found within the
Uvalde gravels. Eight of these flakes are the result of bifacial thinning and can reasonably be
assumed to represent some aspect of either biface construction or maintenance. The other flake is
from a core or tested cobble. All of these flakes and the 12 fragments of FCR were recovered
from either Test Units 1 or 2, except for a piece of shatter recovered from Test Unit 5.
Site 41COL172 is a low-density, single-component site in an environment characterized by
rapidly aggrading sediments, which have contributed to heightened levels of preservation. The
site has been buried 1–1.3 m below the surface by rapidly accumulating alluvial deposits, has
exceptional levels of preservation allowing for the recovery of fauna material, and has intact
stratigraphic sequences containing diagnostic artifacts. Thus, the stratigraphic integrity is among
the best that could be hoped for. Therefore, GMI recommended that further work at site
41COL172 be undertaken, with a particular focus on that part of the site closest to the bank of
Muddy Creek in the area of the highest artifact densities. Additional eligibility testing was
subsequently undertaken at site 41COL172 under a later contract.

82

SITE 41COL173 (WA 12)

Previous Investigations
The site is located at the junction of FM 981 and Desert Creek, east of the town of Blue Ridge, in
Collin County. The previous investigations conducted on this site initially included a
combination of pedestrian survey and shovel testing (Sills et al. 2005b). The pedestrian survey
and nine shovel tests conducted within the extended ROW for FM 981 failed to identify any
cultural remains or reach subsoil. It was subsequently decided an adjusted strategy involving the
excavating of exploratory archeological trenches would be undertaken to (1) evaluate the
potential for in situ burial of archeological deposits, and (2) search for buried archeological sites
and evaluate the potential effects of the proposed project on them. The results of the adjusted
strategy included the excavation of three backhoe trenches placed as close to the creek banks as
possible. The trenches on the west bank produced culturally related materials, but the trench on
the east bank was culturally sterile (Sills et al. 2005b:4). The cultural material observed from the
trenches included faunal evidence field-identified as the remains of white-tailed deer and turtle,
and a medial fragment of a biface from a depth between 45–90 cm bs. PBS&J, the initial
researchers, recommended further investigation on the site in order to fully assess the research
potential prior to the beginning of construction (Sills et al. 2005b).

Current Investigations
Site 41COL173 is situated on a relatively flat, wooded terrace on the western bank of Desert
Creek. The landform is similar on both the north and south sides of FM 981. The northern side
of FM 981 has a series of partially filled channel scars, especially in the western portion of the
ROW. The southern side of FM 981 is completely flat, except for a deeply incised intermitted
streambed at the far western edge of the newly acquired ROW. The intermitted streambed runs
west-to-east until reaching the western edge of the ROW, and then turns sharply to the south
passing to the west of the southwestern ROW corner. A number of large bois d’arc trees are
scattered throughout the southern terrace.
The underlying geology of the site is Holocene alluvium, and the mapped soils are Trinity clay,
occasionally flooded (Hanson and Wheeler 1969), with a typical profile of 0 to 6 inches of very
dark gray (5Y 3/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) dry, moderate fine and medium granular and
moderate fine subangular blocky structure; over 6 to 16 inches of very dark gray (5Y 3/1) clay,
dark gray (5Y 4/1) dry, moderate medium subangular blocky structure; over 16 to 36 inches of
very dark gray (5Y 3/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) dry, weak fine and very fine subangular blocky
structure; over 36 to 64 inches of very dark gray (5Y 3/1) clay, dark gray (5Y 4/1) dry, weak
coarse blocky structure, common fine and medium distinct olive yellow (5Y 6/6) and yellowish
brown (10YR 5/8) redox concentrations; over 64 to 75 inches of dark olive gray (5Y 3/2) clay,
olive gray (5Y 4/2) dry, weak coarse angular blocky structure, common fine and medium distinct
olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6; 5Y 6/8) and few coarse distinct light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) redox
concentrations.
GMI returned to the site from 13–18 November 2006 and excavated seven test trenches. Once
the trench profiles were investigated, GMI archeologists placed two 1-x-1-m test units off the
edge of the two most southeasterly trenches and four 50-x-50-cm units off the edge of four other
83

trenches. The average dimensions of the trenches excavated on this site were 4.6 m long, with the
upper 3 ft of the trench stepped to a width of 1.3 m and the bottom of the trench having a width of
0.7 m and averaging a depth of 1.7 m bs. The stratigraphic profiles were recorded and inspected
by the Project Archeologist. A test unit was extended off all the trenches with the exception of
Trench F, which lacked a buried A horizon. Each trench and test unit position was documented
using GPS readings. Once these trenches were profiled and the adjacent overburden stripped
from the locations where the test unit were to be located, GMI archeologists laid out two 1-x-1-m
test units and four 50-x-50-cm units with one side open to the trench profile. These units were
then excavated in 10-cm arbitrary levels with all excavated materials screened through ¼-inch
hardware cloth. These units were excavated to 10 cm below the cultural-bearing layers or until it
was obvious excavations had entered the underlying AC horizon.
In total, 179 artifacts were recovered from this site. Backhoe trench excavations yielded a piece
of FCR, one piece of charcoal, and four bones. The material from the test units consists of three
stone tools (two projectile points and a fragment of an end scraper), 20 pieces of FCR, 10 pieces
of debitage, a piece of charcoal, 67 fragments of bone, 25 pieces of shell, and 47 pieces of burned
clay/earth. The lithic assemblage from site 41COL173 contains two projectile points, one
fragment of an exhausted end scraper, eight flakes, two pieces of shatter, and 21 fragments of
FCR. All of the lithic materials are identified as being of local raw materials, with the exception
of one projectile point. The projectile points were typed as a Catahoula point (Bell 1960:16;
Justice 1987:237; Turner et al. 1999:206) and a Cuney point (Suhm and Jelks 1962:271; Turner et
al. 1999:210). The faunal assemblage from this site involved 71 specimens, with white-tailed
deer the most common mammal. Other identified species were bison, as well as one bone
fragment identified as that of a commonly found rat assumed to be an intrusion into the deposits.
The remaining 31 faunal bones were so badly broken, burned, and weathered that they were
unidentifiable. Excavations on site 41COL173 yielded a total of 47 pieces of burned clay/earth
and 25 fragments of mussel shell
Site 41COL173 is a low-density, single-component site in an environment characterized by
rapidly aggrading sediments, which have contributed to heightened levels of preservation. The
site has been buried 1–1.3 m below the surface by rapidly accumulating alluvial deposits, has
exceptional levels of preservation allowing for the recovery of fauna material, and has intact
stratigraphic sequences containing diagnostic artifacts. Thus, GMI recommended additional
archeological investigation at 41COL173 through the use of limited-sized block excavations
placed over the sections of the site with the highest densities of cultural materials.
Recommendations also included the collection of flotation samples in the form of representative
columns, with the number of columns to be determined by the areal extent of the excavation
block. Subsequently, additional eligibility testing was undertaken at site 41COL173 under a later
contract.

SITE 41DL203 (WA 17)
The development and preparation of the scope of work for testing 41DL203 was completed as a
work authorization under this contract. Fieldwork was not conducted under this contract but was
initiated in November 2007 under a separate contract.

SITE 41DN445 (WA 16)

Previous Investigations
Site 41DN445 is located east of the project corridor on a ridge south of Hickory Creek. The site
was initially identified in 1987 by a survey of the Lewisville Lake area by the Institute of Applied
Science at North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) (Lebo and Brown
1990). It consisted of a prehistoric lithic surface scatter as well as a scatter of historic artifacts
and a possible root cellar feature. Due to the paucity of artifacts and poor contextual integrity
resulting from steep slopes and heavy erosion, the site was considered not eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP.
AR Consultants surveyed the originally proposed highway corridor in the winter of 1996–1997
(Skinner 1997). The only cultural material observed within the proposed corridor was a cobble of
Uvalde gravel modified into a core. In addition, two historic structures were identified outside
the corridor and both had been modified. Since site 41DN446 (west of the corridor) was located
on the same landform as 41DN445 and also consisted of both prehistoric and historic artifacts,
and because they were close enough to the project limits to be of concern, sites 41DN445 and
41DN446 were reexamined. The AR Consultants investigator agreed with the original
assessment that the artifact concentration at 41DN445 was sparse and that the site lacked
contextual integrity. Overall conclusions from the survey of the project corridor were that the
upland setting and distance from reliable, permanent water sources would have limited past
human occupation and would explain the paucity of archeological resources within the area.
Ground surface erosion was also extensive throughout the survey area, and no further
investigations were recommended.

Current Investigations
Although the Texas Historical Commission concurred with the recommendations based on
investigations by AR Consultants, changes to the original design of the corridor were later
introduced. These consisted of 0.35 acres of additional ROW to widen areas to facilitate vehicle
turns in three areas; 15 drainage easements (total 5.49 acres) for storm water runoff; and six trail
easements (total 4.02) acres. Thus, the 9.86 acres not previously surveyed were the priority for
the present investigation. On October 2–3, 2006, GMI attempted to revisit site 41DN445.
The geology of the area consists of the Upper Cretaceous Woodbine Formation, although small
portions of Holocene alluvium and Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits occur near Hickory
Creek (BEG 1991). The mapped soils are the Birome-Rayex-Aubrey complex, fine sandy loam,
2–15 percent slopes (Ford and Pauls 1980). The soils typically consisted of 5 to 10 cm of
yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) or strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam above yellowish
brown (10YR 5/8) sandy clay. Sandstone gravels were frequently encountered in the shovel tests.
No archeological materials were present within these shovel test units, and none were observed
on the surrounding ground surfaces. The vegetation of the mapped site location consists of
grasses, briers, vines, brush, and prickly pear, as well as several areas of relatively recent growths
of oak, elm, hickory, mesquite, and juniper.

85

Based on the results of the previous investigations, observations in the new portions of the APE,
and familiarity with the natural environment of the region, the original alignment was spotchecked for surface materials. The site area was shovel tested and visually examined, particularly
along the hiking/equestrian trails that extend through these areas; however, no archeological
materials were identified. A residential subdivision now stands in the general area where a
second house was reported west of the corridor, south of a set of railroad tracks that intersect with
Village Parkway.
The thin, ancient soils within both the previously surveyed highway corridor and the added
easements and ROWs have little potential for containing buried archeological deposits, and no
archeological materials were observed on the surface or in shovel tests where the possibility for
intact soils existed. Urban development has also disturbed much of the southern one-fourth of the
project APE. Previously recorded site 41DN445 is plotted near, but outside, the project APE. No
material evidence of this site was observed during the present survey, and no further work is
recommended within the current APE.

SITE 41DN446 (WA 16)

Previous Investigations
Site 41DN446 is located west of the project corridor on a ridge south of Hickory Creek. The site
was initially identified in 1987 by a survey of the Lewisville Lake area by the Institute of Applied
Science at North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas) (Lebo and Brown
1990). It was recorded as a prehistoric lithic surface scatter as well as a scatter of historic
artifacts. Site 41DN446 is located on the same landform as, 41DN445 (east of the corridor). The
contextual integrity of 41DN466 was reported as somewhat better than 41DN455 due to thicker
soil deposits, and one arrow point was recovered. Minimal testing for NRHP eligibility was
recommended.
AR Consultants surveyed the originally proposed highway corridor in the winter of 1996–1997
(Skinner 1997). The only cultural material observed within the proposed corridor was a cobble of
Uvalde gravel modified into a core. Because sites 41DN445 and 41DN446 were close enough to
the project limits to be of concern, they were reexamined. Testing of 41DN446 by AR
Consultants failed to locate any buried archeological materials or evidence of human occupation,
nor were any artifacts identified on the ground surface within the project corridor. Overall
conclusions from the survey of the project corridor were that the upland setting and distance from
reliable, permanent water sources would have limited past human occupation and would explain
the paucity of archeological resources within the area. Ground surface erosion was also extensive
throughout the survey area, and no further investigations were recommended.

Current Investigations
Although the Texas Historical Commission concurred with the recommendations based on
investigations by AR Consultants, changes to the original design of the corridor were later
introduced. These consisted of 0.35 acres of additional ROW to widen areas to facilitate vehicle

86

turns in three areas; 15 drainage easements (total 5.49 acres) for storm water runoff; and six trail
easements (total 4.02) acres. Thus, the 9.86 acres not previously surveyed were the priority for
the present investigation. GMI attempted to revisit site 41DN446 on October 2–3, 2006.
The geology of the area consists of the Upper Cretaceous Woodbine Formation, although small
portions of Holocene alluvium and Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits occur near Hickory
Creek (BEG 1991). The soils mapped for the area are the Birome-Rayex-Aubrey complex, fine
sandy loam, 2–15 percent slopes (Ford and Pauls 1980). The soils in the shovel tests typically
consisted of 5 to 10 cm of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) or strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) sandy clay
loam above yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) sandy clay. Sandstone gravels were frequently
encountered in the shovel tests. No archeological materials were present within these shovel test

The thin, ancient soils within both the previously surveyed highway corridor and the added
easements and ROWs have little potential for containing buried archeological deposits, and no
archeological materials were observed on the surface or in shovel tests where the possibility for
intact soils existed. Urban development has also disturbed much of the southern one-fourth of the
project APE. Previously recorded site 41DN446 was plotted near, but outside, the project APE.
No material evidence of this site was observed during the present survey, and no further work
was recommended within the current APE.

SITE 41FK121 (WA 15)

Current Investigations
GMI identified and recorded site 41FK121 based on information from Mr. Gary Cheatwood, who
observed cultural materials being disturbed during construction along US 271. The site is on the
east edge of the ROW approximately 150 m northwest of the US 271 bridge over Sanders Slough.
The surface of the site area within the ROW had been cleared of vegetation. The geology of the
area consists of Holocene alluvium on a Pleistocene terrace, and the soils in the three small areas
have been mapped as Kaufman clay, frequently flooded (Roberts 1990; Thomas 1977).
Stratigraphy from units with cultural material was typified by 0–25/30 cm bd of very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2, dry) fill mainly of redeposited topsoil from the adjacent scraped area mixed
with mulch, very blocky and compact; over 25/30–50 cm bd of brown (10YR 5/3, dry) sandy
loam, upper part mixed with pieces of dark clay and mulch, grading to cleaner sandy loam with
cultural materials; over 50–52 cm bd of light gray (10YR 7/1, dry) pale sugar sand; over 52–135
cm bd of grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) and reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/8, dry) mottled clay. In units
87

without cultural material, the clay typically began at the surface (0–5 cm bs) with a brown (10YR
3/2) clay fill and introduced mulch, over 4–40 cm bs of dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay, over
40–80 cm bs of brown (10YR 5/3) and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2) slightly sandy clay. The
cultural deposits are limited to an area of about 12-x-5 m of sandy loam sediments; the thickness
of this remaining deposit is approximately 20–30 cm. The small portion of this site that exhibits
the intact sandy loam sediments is the area that the informant referred to as the sandy pimple
mound or “sand boil.” Areas between these “sand boils” contain continuous clay profiles with no
expression of the sandy loam matrix.
From August 14–25, 2006, GMI excavated nine shovel tests and three 1-x-1-m test units to
further characterize the nature of the archeological deposits (Figure 16). Cultural materials were
recovered from four shovel tests and all three test units, all within an area of about 12-x-5 m. No
cultural features were identified. Artifacts consisted predominantly of chipped stone and FRC:
four bifaces, 106 flakes, 12 pieces of shatter; 5.6 kilograms (kg) of FCR; and one ground stone.
The only diagnostic artifact was a possible Gary dart point from the upper 10 cm of a shovel test
in clearly redeposited materials used to create the erosion control berm. The ground stone was a
piece of quartz sandstone used as an abrader, recovered from a test unit.
Based on the possible Gary point, the site is dated to the Late Archaic period. This point,
however, was found in the upper 10 cm of a unit on the redeposited erosion control berm and is
therefore not in its original context. Although chipped stone debitage and bifaces, the possible
Gary point, an abrader, and FCR were recovered, no features or artifact concentrations were
found. Extensive disturbance within the ROW during construction severely impacted the
integrity of the upper portion of the cultural deposit, and a few artifacts appeared to have
migrated vertically through the large vertisolic cracks. Therefore, the portion of site 41FK121
investigated within the current APE revealed little or no research potential, and no further
archeological research within this area of the site was recommended.

SITE 41FK122 (WA 15)

Current Investigations
GMI identified site 41FK122 also based on information from Mr. Gary Cheatwood, who had
collected a Gary point and a piece of “obsidian” (with small white inclusions, cortex, and flake
scars) eroding from the riverbank just outside the ROW along US 271. Subsequent x-ray
fluorescence (XRF) analysis in late 2006 by Northwest Research Obsidian Studies Laboratory in
Corvallis, Oregon, and the Berkeley Archaeological XRF Laboratory, University of California,
Berkley, determined that the “obsidian” had no measurable Fe (iron), which ruled out the
possibility of its being obsidian, and was instead glass slag. According to Northwest Research
Obsidian Studies Laboratory, the “obsidian-like” qualities were likely the product of some kind of
indeterminate high-temperature industrial process, or the uncommon result of some type of hightemperature natural process (possibly forest fire or fulgurite, for example). Mr. Cheatwood
related that these materials were recovered from just above a gravel layer near the base of the
riverbank slope. This site is located within the current US 271 ROW, southeast of the Sulphur
River and southwest of the highway.

The area within the ROW in this area was limited due to recent disturbance by heavy machinery
and was heavily vegetated with poison ivy, sassafras, and horsetail. Recent borrow disturbance
was apparent near the base of the riverbank and in a wide swath extending west from the bridge
alignment. The riverbank here is relatively steep and the top of the slope to the flood plain is a
steep cut. The geology of the area consists of Holocene alluvium on a Pleistocene terrace and the
soils areas have been mapped as Kaufman clay, frequently flooded (Roberts 1990; Thomas 1977).
Stratigraphy within the sandy soils on top of the flood plain is typified by 0–10 cm bs of dark
brown (10YR 3/3, dry) loose silty loam organic A horizon, over 10–40 cm bs of brown (10YR
5/3, dry) relatively homogenous sandy loam, over 40–60 cm bs of dark yellowish brown (10YR
4/6) and grayish brown (2.5Y 5/2, dry) mottled orange clay.
Testing at 41FK122 involved the excavation of three controlled test units from August 14–25,
2006. A total of 271 artifacts—68 prehistoric and 203 historic—was recovered. Prehistoric
material consisted of 55 pieces of lithic debitage, one small potsherd with brushed decoration, 11
pieces of baked clay, a shell fragment, 101.6 g of bone, and 263 g of FCR, all from one test unit,
with the exception of three pieces of quartzite possible shatter. Historic-age artifacts consisted of
five various building materials, eight historic ceramic fragments, 113 pieces of glass, two small
shell buttons, and four pieces of plastic.
The site boundary probably extends beyond the ROW to the southwest onto private property.
The prehistoric period of occupation for this site is likely Late Prehistoric, based on the single
brushed sherd of prehistoric pottery.
The prehistoric artifacts could not be isolated
stratigraphically; they came from a stratum that also contained historic-age and recent materials,
with underlying strata also containing recent materials. The historic materials ranged in age from
late nineteenth century (represented by cut nails) to very recent.
Site 41FK122 is heavily disturbed and spatially limited within the ROW. One piece of
prehistoric pottery was recovered from this site; below it, however, a plastic twist tie and glass
were recovered. Due to the limited nature of this site and the degree of vertical mixing, as well as
the paucity of diagnostic artifacts and lack of features or artifact concentrations, the investigated
portion of the site within the ROW has little or no research potential. Therefore, no further
archeological work within the current APE was recommended at this site.

SITE 41HU80 (WA 21)

Current Investigations
Site 41HU80 is a newly recorded historic site located 0.5 miles east of the Collin/Hunt county
line on property owned by Jimmy Ray Saunders et al. The underlying geology of the area is the
Upper Cretaceous Marlbrook Marl (BEG 1991). The mapped soils for the area are Houston black
clay (Lane and Janak 1981). Area vegetation consists of a plowed agricultural field surrounding a
small stand of trees, mostly hackberry and native juniper.
Surficial evidence of a structure consisted of a cylindrical brick-lined well and historic cultural
material. Six shovel tests were excavated in order to recover material to establish the type of
structure and a date of occupation. The material recovered consisted of one piece of metal and
glass jewelry, three buttons (one glass, one metal, one plastic—post-1942), two machine-made
90

glass bottle necks (post-1910), two machine-made bottle caps, one small machine-made perfume
bottle (post-1910), four bottle glass fragments, one window glass fragment, two marbles (one
machine-made glass, one stoneware—1884–1918; Randall 1979), one wire nail (post-1890), one
spade connector, one three-holed brick, and one wheat penny (date obscured, though minted
between 1909 and 1958). Although material was recovered from the surface and two shovel
tests, the majority came from 20–40 cm bs in Shovel Test 4, which was in the middle of the site.
The material recovered from the site places the occupation in the early to mid-twentieth century
and is typical of a farmstead from that period. Computerized deed records in the Hunt County
Clerk’s Office are only available from the mid-1980s to the present. Research revealed that at
some point in the past Juanita Saunders acquired the property from her husband, sold it to her
children, who in turn sold it back to Juanita, and then reacquired it on her death. No information
regarding structures was found on the available deeds, and no structures are shown on the 1939
soil survey map for the county. The 1981 county soil map shows a house and barn in the vicinity,
but the location does not correspond to the site location. Site 41HU80 contains limited research
potential because of the lack of significant intact deposits, defined living surfaces, or well-defined
features, other than the brick well. Therefore, no further work was recommended for this site
within the current APE.

SITE 41MR64 (WA 14)

Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicates that site 41MR64, a historic town site, occurs on
the east side of SH 49 in the vicinity of the anticipated road improvements. The site dates from
the middle nineteenth century, and the investigators noted that the property abstract lists a
foundry, two houses, a Methodist church and associated cemetery, an African-American church
and cemetery, and at least one schoolhouse on the 40-acre tract surveyed. Additional structures
were indicated on a historic town map that was not obtained until after the fieldwork was
conducted. During the survey, remnants of at least two house sites and the foundry were
identified, and the two cemeteries appeared to still be in use. Observed artifacts included
fragments of whiteware, stoneware, porcelain, lavender glass, cut nails, and bricks. Some
materials demonstrated evidence of burning. The site was recommended as potentially eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. It is presently a designated SAL.

Current Investigations
The site occurs on gently sloping uplands dissected by creek tributaries. The portion of the site
investigated (SH 49 ROW) is in a public park on gently sloping, grass-covered terrain. Mixed
pine and hardwood trees flank the park to the west and east. Survey consisted of walkover and
surface inspection of the APE, as well as systematic shovel testing of areas that were not visibly
eroded or disturbed. The surroundings south of SH 49 consist of residential structures, yards, and
a tavern. The western one-quarter is pasture. A public park flanked by pasture to the west and
residences to the east occurs north of SH 49. The eastern one-fifth of the APE north of SH 49
consists of residential lawns that are heavily eroded. No archeological materials were observed in
these exposed areas. The remaining portions along the northeast side suggested the presence of
91

intact soil deposits and were systematically shovel tested. The vegetation consists primarily of
grass. Mixed pine and hardwood trees line the roadway along the pasture areas and the eastern
portion of the park area. Trees are present, but less densely clustered along the park and
residential areas.
The underlying geology of the area consists entirely of Eocene Queen City Sand (BEG 1975).
The mapped soils for the area are Bowie fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes; (Natural
Resources Conservation Service n.d.; 2004). Shovel test profiles generally consisted of 5 to 10
cm of brown (7.5YR 4/4) or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam filled with ironstone
gravels, above 5 to 25 cm of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) gravelly fine sandy loam. Subsoil
varied from yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) sandy clay loam with strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) mottles
to yellowish red (5YR 5/8) clayey sandy loam.
Four of the 22 shovel tests excavated on the north side of the highway produced artifacts (Figure
17). Two fragments of Bristol stoneware were recovered from ST 2 at 10 cm bs. The two pieces
fit together, and a blue design is painted on exterior of the larger fragment. Delineation shovel
tests 10 m north, east, and west were sterile. A southern delineation was not excavated because it
would have been in the road ditch. No additional artifacts were observed until ST 13 near the
west end of the park. Two cut nails, six fragments of cast iron, and a piece of slag were
recovered from the upper 20 cm of this unit. Three additional cut nails and two pieces of rusted
iron were collected from the 20–40 cm bs level. ST 14 was placed 10 m east of ST 13, and
several cut nails and pieces of slag were observed. Two small fragments of rusted iron and two
small pieces of window glass were also recovered. ST 16 was excavated 10 m east of ST 14 and
did not produce artifacts, nor did ST 12, which was 20 m east of ST 16. ST 15 was placed 10 m
west of ST 13, and two pieces of iron were recovered. Several fragments of slag were also
present but not collected. Subsoil was encountered at a shallower depth than in ST 13. ST 17—
placed 5 m west of ST 15—revealed only 5 cm of topsoil; no artifacts were observed. ST 17 was
the last shovel test east of Kellyville Road. All shovel test units west of the road were sterile.
North and south delineations were not excavated because the landform descended into the road
ditch to the south and buried utility lines were present along the ROW edge, approximately 5 m
north of ST 15.
Much of the APE south of the highway did not demonstrate potential for intact soil deposits. The
western one-fourth (approximately to Kellyville Road) consists of roadbed, ditch, and deflated
soils. No culverts or driveways are present in the area, and it is unlikely that the proposed
improvements will affect this area. The APE directly south of the cluster of positive shovel tests
east of Kellyville Road descends into a residential yard, and a buried gas pipeline extends through
the area. A parking area for a tavern has disturbed the APE east of the residential property to the
Kellyville Cutoff. Two shovel tests were excavated east of the Kellyville Cutoff, but both were
sterile and indicated soil deposits less than 30 cm deep. The remainder of the east end was
heavily eroded, and a wall of ironstone boulders lines the south side of the drainage ditch to
reduce soil runoff.
Artifacts consistent with a nineteenth- to early twentieth-century iron foundry and domestic
occupation were identified in two small, discrete areas along the north side of SH 49 in the
vicinity of 41MR64. They are similar to artifacts identified within the site during a previous
investigation, and, therefore, are not likely to substantially alter the present understanding of the
site. The two artifact locales also represent very small components of a much larger site and
occur in an area that has already encountered subsurface disturbances from road construction and
92

buried utility lines. It is also probable that most of the artifacts remaining within the APE were
removed during the present investigation. Consequently, any impacts from the proposed
improvements would have no additional adverse effect on the overall contextual integrity and
research value of the site. Therefore, this small portion of site 41MR64, by itself, was not
considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL, and no further work
was considered necessary for this small portion of the site that falls within the current APE.

SITE 41MR99 (WA 14)

Previous Investigations
Records curated at TARL indicate that site 41MR99, a nineteenth-century iron foundry, occurs on
the east side of SH 49 in the vicinity of the anticipated road improvements. The foundry site
encompasses an area of approximately 22 acres and consists of remnants of a stone block
foundation, scatters of hand-made bricks, and several slag heaps. One iron artifact was also
identified. The site was recommended as potentially eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for
listing as an SAL. Although the investigator recommended application for designation of the site
as an SAL in 1993, it is not presently listed.

Current Investigations
Much of the south side of SH 49 consists of a steep slope resulting from cutting into the landform
to facilitate construction of the roadway. The underlying geology of the area is Eocene Queen
City Sand (BEG 1975). The mapped soils for the area are Cuthbert gravelly fine sandy loam, 5 to
15 percent slopes; Kirvin very fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes;, and Iulus fine sandy loam,
frequently flooded (NRCS 2004). Most shovel test units consisted of 20–30 cm of dark yellowish
brown (10YR 4/4) sandy loam with 30–50 percent ironstone gravels and cobbles above yellowish
red (5YR 5/6) fine sandy loam, also containing significant quantities of ironstone. The walls of a
tributary of nearby French Creek were also examined and the profile resembled that of the shovel
tests in the area. North of SH 49, the APE and surrounding area is generally clear-cut and
consists of grasses and brush with a sparse scatter of young pine and hardwood trees parallel to
the roadway. The area in the vicinity of the French Creek tributary consists primarily of mixed
woods and vines. Vegetation along the south side of SH 49 is also primarily wooded with young
pine and hardwood trees.
In most areas, 2–6 m of earth have been removed and it is unlikely that the proposed
improvements will affect the less disturbed portions at the top of the landform. An unpaved road
or trail also extends along the top of the landform. The south side of the roadway was walked and
visually inspected. Surface erosion was notable to the extent that ironstone was visibly eroding
through the ground surface. No artifacts or archeological features were observed.
The north side of the highway, which is the plotted location of the site, consisted of slightly more
intact soil deposits, and the area was intensively shovel tested. Initial shovel tests were placed at
30-m intervals, but spacing was reduced to 10-m intervals when what was thought to be the
western site boundary was approached. However, after six sterile shovel tests in a row that
consisted primarily of ironstone gravels and cobbles, intervals were expanded back to 30 m.
94

Although a few shovel tests extended as deep as 55 cm bs, most were no deeper than 30 cm bs.
Most shovel test units contained significant quantities of ironstone. Ironstone was also often
observed on the ground surface in many areas within and adjacent to the project APE. No
artifacts were identified in the shovel tests. Pieces of slag were occasionally observed on the
ground surface north of the ROW markers, but none was present within the ROW itself. No
artifacts, features, or paleosols were identified in the walls of the tributary of French Creek.
The south side of SH 49 has been heavily impacted by previous road construction activities, and
little intact ground surface remains within the APE. The less disturbed areas are distant enough
from the roadway that they will not be affected by the proposed improvements. Ground surface
erosion is also evident, and no archeological materials were observed in these areas. Although
pieces of slag were observed on the ground surface north of SH 49, these were all north of the
existing ROW. Shovel tests and ground inspection within the ROW indicated thin, rocky surface
soils with no archeological materials present. Although 41MR99 might have extended south of
SH 49 in the past, construction of the road appeared to have impacted that portion of the site, and
no material evidence of the site remained within the existing highway ROW. No settings with
reasonable potential to contain significant archeological deposits were noted during this
evaluation. Thus, no further work was recommended within the APE.

SITE 41MX55 (WA 6)

Previous Investigations
A member of the Texas Archeological Stewardship Network recorded the site in 1992 (Nelson
1992) on the north side of SH 11 when lithic artifacts were identified on the ground surface after
part of the ROW was trenched for installation of underground utility lines. Four artifacts,
including the distal end of a biface, were collected; however, the investigator noted that a
collector had visited the site prior to his investigation.

Current Investigations
This multicomponent site is recorded as being on the north side of SH 11, east of Boggy Creek.
The vegetation consists largely of grass although hardwood forest lines the south side of SH 11,
and clusters of young to mid-size hardwoods line the fencerow along portions of the north side.
The underlying geology of the area is Eocene Queen City Sand. Three soil units are mapped
within the project area, and these are represented in roughly equal proportions. The western
segment consists of Estes clay loam, frequently flooded. Besner-Talco complex, 0 to 2 percent
slopes, comprises the central one-third of the project area, and Bowie fine sandy loam, 2 to 5
percent slopes, accounts for the eastern one-third. Shovel test profiles north of SH 11 typically
consisted of 10–80 cm of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) to brownish yellow (10YR 6/6)
sandy loam above light brown (7.5YR 5/4) sandy loam. Profiles along the south side of the
highway usually indicated light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sandy loam.
Thirty-one shovel tests were excavated within the project area, and 14 of these produced artifacts
(Figure 18). Positive shovel tests occurred on both sides of the highway, indicating that SH 11
cuts through 41MX55. The eastern and western boundaries of the site are defined by the extent

of positive shovel tests and intact ROW. The site likely extends across the top of the terrace
north and south of the ROW, but these areas occur on private property and could not be
investigated. Therefore, the southern and northern extents of the site are presently undefined.
The majority of the positive shovel tests contained only lithic debitage—typically one to three
small flakes. However, ST 7 yielded a quartzite cobble (16–27 cm bs) and, from depth, a grogtempered, red-slipped pottery sherd (40–60 cm bs) and a dart point (approximately 70 cm bs)
possibly consistent with the Ellis type. Two burned rock and two small pieces of charcoal were
found in ST 9. Historic artifacts—a black porcelain button (ST 15) and a piece of whiteware (ST
17)—were recovered; the button was the only material in ST 15, but a flake of heat-treated chert
was also recovered from ST 17.
Most artifacts within the project area were recovered at depths between 40 cm and 80 cm bs,
although materials were occasionally observed in higher levels. An artifact occurred in the upper
20 cm of a shovel test in only one instance (ST 14, north side). ST 7 on the south side of SH 11
indicated that archeological deposits extend deeply in some areas. The unit was situated in the
upper portion of the slope of the road cut, and, although nearly 80 cm of soil was missing relative
to the top of the present landform, artifacts were recovered for 70 additional cm.
Fourteen of the 31 shovel tests within the existing ROW contained artifacts, and positive units
extended approximately 200 m along the landform on which the site was initially identified.
Although artifact concentration was typically sparse, cultural material frequently occurred at
depths in excess of 40 cm bs, and intact buried deposits are possible. Shovel Test 7 on the south
side of SH 11 contained diagnostic artifacts, and the deposit extended approximately 160 cm
below the present ground surface.
It was uncertain how much of the existing ROW would be impacted by the proposed
improvements. If no improvements were to be planned outside existing disturbed areas, no
further investigation would be necessary. However, if any impacts (e.g., tree removal) were to be
scheduled in areas outside the already disturbed portion of the ROW, site 41MX55 could be
affected and additional investigation of these areas would be advised. In the event that grounddisturbing activities were planned beyond the limits of the existing ditches, limited testing of the
ROW for site integrity and eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP was recommended.

SITE 41MX141 (WA 4)

Previous Investigations
Site 41MX141 is located on the north side of the project area and consists of a prehistoric
habitation site. The University of Texas at Austin investigated the site in the early 1970s and
noted that the site was used for borrow for county road construction. Investigators observed lithic
debitage, bone, and shell at the site, and a local resident donated Caddoan pottery from a possible
burial at the site (Bell 1973).
In 1999, Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted a survey of the current project area. The flood
plain was the primary area of focus, and investigators excavated five backhoe trenches east and
west of the main creek channel. No cultural materials or features were identified in the trenches.
97

Two shovel tests were also excavated adjacent to trenches to confirm that the absence of observed
artifacts was not merely the result of poor examination of the backdirt, and no artifacts were
recovered from these units. Two additional shovel tests were excavated in the upland landform at
the east end of the project area, and again, both were sterile. As a result of the absence of
archeological materials, the investigator recommended that the construction project be allowed to
proceed (Gadus 1999). TxDOT and the Texas Historical Commission concurred with the
recommendation, and construction eventually began.

Current Investigations
In April 2006, TxDOT learned of a report that artifacts had been discovered during construction.
The project was halted and Geo-Marine was called to investigate the project area to confirm the
presence of archeological materials within the project area. Eocene silts and clays of the Reklaw
Formation underlie the upland ridges over Boggy Creek. The flood plain of the creek is
composed of Holocene alluvium (BEG 1979). The mapped soil for the site area is Lilbert loamy
fine sand (Roberts 1990). The profile of the shovel tests consisted of 15 cm to 55 cm of strong
brown (7.5YR 5/6) loamy sand with occasional hematite gravels above yellowish red (5YR 4/6)
sandy clay. The vegetation consists of small patches of grass within the ROW, although most of
it has been scraped and excavated. The property north of the ROW is grass pasture with scatters
of hardwood trees.
The entire project area—most of which had been scraped by construction equipment, often to
gray or light brown clay, or exhibited ditches that had been excavated and a foundation for a box
culvert for the relief channel that had already been constructed—was traversed and visually
inspected. Because the flood plain had been extensively trenched during the 1999 survey and no
archeological materials were identified at that time and none were observed along the exposed
surfaces during the present investigation, attention focused on a small knoll east of the relief
channel at the easternmost extent of the ROW. A single small tertiary flake was identified on the
exposed surface, and the landform was shovel tested.
The portion of the knoll within the ROW had also been scraped and an estimated 10 cm to 60 cm
of soil had been removed in many areas. Red sandy clay was visible on the surface in some
portions. A buried cable also extended along the northern ROW boundary parallel to a fence that
separates the project area from private property. The majority of the knoll occurs on the adjacent
privately owned property. Although the small tertiary flake was identified inside the ROW
during the surface inspection of this landform, no features were visible in the more exposed areas
along the knoll. Artifacts were also identified in two nonconsecutive shovel test units. A small
flake was recovered from Shovel Test 3 at a depth of 35–40 cm bs, and another small flake was
recovered from Shovel Test 5 at a depth of approximately 40–50 cm bs. Delineation shovel tests
were excavated approximately 5 m south of the positive shovel tests near the south edge of the
landform. These shovel tests tended to be shallower than the series to the north due to a heavier
degree of mechanical scraping in this area. The shovel test south of Shovel Test 5 was sterile;
however, a small chert flake was recovered from the unit south of Shovel Test 3 between 20 cm
and 30 cm bs. An additional shovel test placed 10 m west of this shovel test was sterile.
Field observations confirmed the presence of an archeological site within the ROW and the site
was reported to both TxDOT and TARL. Upon submission of a site form by GMI, TARL issued
the trinomial 41MX141 for the site. Based on the amount and degree of ground disturbance to
98

41MX141 inside the ROW and the sparseness of both surface and subsurface artifacts, it
appeared that the portion of the site within the project area had been largely destroyed by
construction activities. Any diagnostic artifacts that may have been encountered by construction
workers appeared to have been collected. No features were identified either, and this observation
suggested one or a combination of the following possibilities: (1) any features inside the project
area have been scraped away with most of the artifacts; (2) the site represents an ephemeral
occupation for which there is little material evidence; or (3) the portion of the site inside the
ROW represents a more marginal part of the site and more substantial and intact archeological
deposits may occur north of the fence line on the adjacent private property. Therefore, because of
the low density of identified artifacts, absence of archeological features, and high degree of
ground disturbance in the area, it was considered unlikely that this portion of site 41MX141
contained intact archeological materials, and no further work was recommended within the
current APE.

SITE 41SA29 (WA 7)

Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicates that G. E. Arnold recorded this site. No dates are
provided on the site form, although the atlas indicates that the particular form used to document
this site most commonly dates between 1939 and 1941. Site 41SA29 is plotted on the west side
of FM 3230 on a western bluff above Ayish Bayou. At the time it was recorded, the site was
roughly 1 acre in size and occurred primarily in a plowed field. Pottery and projectile points had
been reported before the site was recorded, and both types of artifacts were identified within the
road ditch at the time it was formally investigated.

Current Investigations
Site 41SA29 is plotted at the south end of the terrace on the west side of the road. The underlying
geology of the area is Eocene Reklaw formation (BEG 1993). No soil survey has been published
for San Augustine County, but red (2.5YR 5/8) sandy clay was visible on the ground surface of
the project area. The vegetation consists primarily of grass, and mixed hardwood and pine trees
line the roadway along the fence lines.
The terrace on which FM 3230 occurs had been graded to accommodate the roadway, and the
road cut extends to the fence line on the west side. In some areas, up to 50 cm of soil had been
removed. In addition, a buried cable in the ROW parallels the fence, and a trench for a utility line
was visible along the ground surface of the northern three-fourths of the project area. On the east
side, approximately 2 m of the graded landform separate the road shoulder from the eastern edge
of the ROW. At this point, the landform abruptly drops approximately 5 m into the Ayish Bayou
flood plain. Therefore, the area was visually inspected.
Upon visual examination, the area revealed the same kind of disturbances along the entire west
side of the ROW. The project area exhibited extensive grading and erosion. No indication of
41SA29 was observed in the exposed landform within the ROW, and no artifacts or features were
visible in the exposed road cut. No archeological materials were observed on the terrace
99

overlooking the site or along any other part of the project area. No settings with reasonable
potential to contain archeological deposits were noted during this evaluation, and thus no further
work was recommended within the APE.

SITE 41SA218 (WA 9)

Previous Investigations
Archeologists with Espey, Huston & Associates identified 41SA218 during a survey in 1997.
The site was recorded as a prehistoric lithic scatter plotted fewer than 30 m east of FM 2558 (also
during the same survey, site 41SA219 was recorded approximately 100 m north of this site). An
unnamed stream that empties into the Sam Rayburn Reservoir flows north of the site. Twentytwo pieces of lithic debitage, a chipped stone tool, and two pieces of worked petrified wood were
recovered from eight shovel tests in a 60-x-45-m area. The investigators considered the site to
possess limited research value due to small site size and low artifact density.

Current Investigations
The underlying geology of the area is the Eocene Yegua Formation. No soil survey has been
published for San Augustine County, nor is a soils map for the region available online through the
NRCS web soil survey page; however, two nearby shovel tests within the existing highway ROW
demonstrated 30–35 cm of brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sandy loam above strong brown
(7.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam. The project APE extends through the Angelina National Forest and
thus predominantly pine forest, mixed with deciduous trees, lines the highway; vegetation within
the ROW consists primarily of grasses. The existing ROW exhibits primarily drainage ditches on
both sides of the roadway, and most of the natural ground surface has been scraped away to
accommodate the roadbed. Ground surface erosion is particularly prominent south of CR 370,
and reddish brown subsoil was often visible along the ground surface.
The site is plotted on the east side of FM 2558 (and approximately 100 m south of 41SA219).
During the present investigation, a piece of flagging tape bearing the site trinomial, and
presumably marking the site datum, was identified. Concrete ROW markers indicate that the
ROW extends just inside the tree line in this area. Approximately 50 cm of soil has been
removed from the ROW adjacent to the 41SA218 flag to accommodate the roadbed, and the area
is eroded to the extent that subsoil and tree roots were visible. No artifacts were observed along
the exposed surface within the ROW or in exposed stream channels near the site.
The project APE exhibits extensive grading and erosion, and no archeological materials were
identified in these exposed areas. Overall, the APE possesses little potential to contain intact, in
situ archeological materials or features. The existing ROW in the vicinity of 41SA218 is heavily
disturbed with no archeological materials visible on the exposed surface. No artifacts were
visible on the ground surface or in eroded areas along the drainage north of the site either within
or outside the existing ROW. The site was previously assessed as having limited research
potential at the time of initial discovery and evaluation, and the present observations do not
contradict the original interpretations. In addition, site form and map indicate that the site was
sufficiently shovel-tested to define the site limits, and the boundary does not extend into the
100

existing ROW. No indications of site 41SA218 were identified within the project APE, and no
settings with reasonable potential to contain intact archeological deposits were noted during this
evaluation. Therefore, no further work was recommended within the current APE.

SITE 41SA219 (WA 9)

Previous Investigations
Archeologists with Espey, Huston & Associates identified 41SA219 during a survey in 1997.
The site was recorded as a prehistoric lithic scatter plotted fewer than 30 m east of FM 2558
(additionally, site 41SA218 was recorded approximately 100 m south of this site during the same
survey). An unnamed stream that empties into the Sam Rayburn Reservoir flows south of the
site. Two positive shovel tests within a 10-x-10-m area contained five pieces of debitage and a
petrified wood tool. The investigators considered the site to possess limited research value due to
small site size and low artifact density.

Current Investigations
The underlying geology of the area is the Eocene Yegua Formation. No soil survey has been
published for San Augustine County, nor is a soils map for the region available online through the
NRCS web soil survey page; however, two shovel tests within the existing highway ROW
demonstrated 30–35 cm of brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) fine sandy loam above strong brown
(7.5YR 5/6) sandy clay loam. The project APE extends through the Angelina National Forest and
thus predominantly pine forest, mixed with deciduous trees, lines the highway; vegetation within
the ROW consists primarily of grasses. The existing ROW exhibits primarily drainage ditches on
both sides of the roadway, and most of the natural ground surface has been scraped away to
accommodate the roadbed. Ground surface erosion is particularly prominent south of CR 370,
and reddish brown subsoil was often visible along the ground surface.
The site is plotted on the east side of FM 2558 (and approximately 100 m north of 41SA218).
During the present investigation, a piece of flagging tape bearing the site trinomial, and
presumably marking the site datum, was identified. Concrete ROW markers indicate that the
ROW extends just inside the tree line in this area. One shovel test was excavated adjacent to the
road ditch in the vicinity of the 41SA219 marker. The shovel test was sterile and reached subsoil
at 30 cm bs. Topsoil is much shallower than the >90-cm soil deposits mentioned on the site form,
and more than a meter of ROW has been removed to accommodate the roadway. An additional
shovel test placed 20 m to the north of the first produced similar results. A piece of unmodified
petrified wood was recovered from the unit, but it appeared to be a natural occurrence. The
ground surface south of the first shovel test is graded and eroded by the abutting stream. No
artifacts were visible on the ground surface in the vicinity, either within or adjacent to the ROW.
The project APE exhibits extensive grading and erosion, and no archeological materials were
identified in these exposed areas. Overall, the APE possesses little potential to contain intact, in
situ archeological materials or features. The two somewhat intact areas shovel-tested near
41SA219 failed to produce artifacts. No artifacts were visible on the ground surface or in eroded
areas along the drainage south of the site either within or outside the existing ROW. The site was
101

previously assessed as having limited research potential at the time of initial discovery and
evaluation, and the present observations do not contradict the original interpretations. In addition,
site form and map indicate that the site was sufficiently shovel-tested to define the site limits, and
the boundary does not extend into the existing ROW. No indications of site 41SA219 were
identified within the project APE, nor were any settings with reasonable potential to contain
intact archeological deposits noted during this evaluation. Therefore, no further work was
recommended within the APE.
SITE 41SB72 (WA 19)

Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicates site 41SB72 is plotted on the west side of FM 3121
and was recorded by B. Mitchum and V. Scarborough in 1977 as “a dense scatter of small chert
and quartzite flakes . . . within a tan sandy fill . . . overlying a gravel lens which contains a high
density of flakes on the surface of a 10 x 4 meter area . . . on both sides of the fence between FM
3121 and USFS land to the west . . . at the edge of the pipeline ROW.” A fragment of porcelain
was found below the surface. Investigators suggested that the surface material originated from a
buried site that had been disturbed during the installation of the adjacent pipeline. Although the
site form mentions that 41SB72 appeared partially disturbed by construction of an underground
pipeline, further investigation of the current project APE in this vicinity was undertaken to
determine if intact archeological deposits were present within the APE and at risk for adverse
impact because the form describes the site as partially occurring within the FM 3121 ROW.
Current Investigations
The site, which is within the Sabine National Forest, is approximately 1.2 miles north of Toledo
Bend Reservoir, and the area is underlain by Pleistocene fluvial terrace deposits and a narrow
ridge of Eocene Carrizo Sand. No soil survey has been published for Sabine County, and no soils
map is available for the area on the Natural Resources Conservation Service web soil survey.
However, a 1935 general soils map shows the general area consists of the Norfolk Group of
Nacogdoches soils. The only shovel test with depth greater than 20–30 cm bs produced a soil
profile of 40 cm of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) gravelly sand above 10 cm of very compact pale
brown (10YR 6/3) sand. Vegetation immediately adjacent to the highway is regularly maintained
(mown) grasses and associated forbs, but along the edge of the APE and beyond is pine forest
interspersed with oak and sweet gum trees and shrubs.
Because the site form indicated that part of the site occurs within the FM 3121 ROW, four shovel
tests were excavated in a single transect within the existing ROW in the site vicinity to determine
if any portion of the site occurs within the proposed APE. Three shovel tests were excavated to
the north of the pipeline that was recorded on the original site form as occurring approximately 6
m south of the site. Shovel testing to the north terminated when the paved asphalt parking, which
extends northward to the shoulder of SH 21, was encountered. An additional shovel test was
placed on the south side of the pipeline easement, presumably south of the site boundary. No
artifacts were observed in any of the shovel tests, and the presence of reddish brown silty clay
subsoil at the surface of STs 2, 3, and 4 and observed over much of the area of the recorded site
location indicated extensive soil deflation. No evidence of the previously observed surface lithic
scatter or any other archeological materials were identified.
102

The original investigators hypothesized that the site might represent a buried lithic deposit that
was partially exposed when a pipeline was constructed. Although the site form mentions that the
lithic deposit appears to be thicker toward the west, which is away from the roadway and ROW,
the current shovel tests indicated either subsoil directly beneath the grass or gravelly sand above
compact sand. None of the units contained archeological materials. Disturbances associated with
the buried pipeline, a drainage ditch, and a paved asphalt parking area within the existing ROW
also limit the potential for intact, in situ archeological materials. It is also possible that the flakes
were part of the road or pipeline fill and introduced from another location. The portion of
41SB72 examined during the present investigation demonstrated a lack of contextual integrity
due to soil deflation and ground disturbances, as well as a complete absence of archeological
materials. Therefore, no further work was recommended for the section of 41SB72 that is
recorded as occurring within the limits of the present project APE.

SITE 41TT2 (WA 6)

Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicates that site 41TT2 is plotted near the present US 271
location and its ROW where road improvements have been proposed. When this site, as well as
site 41TT8, was originally recorded, the highway was located adjacent to the north side of the
railroad tracks, but TARL plotted the site adjacent to the present location of US 271 rather than
the original highway. Because this site was recorded in the 1930s, little information is available
through either the sites atlas or records curated at TARL. Site 41TT2 was recorded as a
prehistoric campsite located on a knoll on the south side of the south channel of Sanders Slough
and is plotted approximately 33 m east of US 271. It was excavated in 1934, and surface
collections were made during a revisit in 1971. Site records indicate that the knoll was scraped
for road fill at one time, although a small strip along a north-south fence line was left undisturbed
(Carroll 1971). In October 2004, Geo-Marine surveyed the current project area as part of a larger
survey for the TxDOT Paris District in anticipation of a realignment and widening project (Tiné
and Largent 2004). No evidence of site 41TT2 was identified within either the existing or
proposed ROW during those investigations, and no further work was recommended for this area.
TxDOT and THC concurred with the recommendations and the road expansion was allowed to
proceed.

Current Investigations
The underlying geology of the area is Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits. The mapped soil for
the area is Kaufman clay, frequently flooded, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Roberts 1990). The
vegetation consists of thinly to moderately clustered hardwood trees and grasses with occasional
interspersed hardwoods and conifers.
Because the project area had already been surveyed and the construction, which had been cleared
by TxDOT and THC through the 2004 survey, was underway at the time of the present
investigation, the level of effort for this current work was reduced to excavation of two shovel
tests within the ROW on the west side of the highway to confirm the absence of intact soils.
Current investigations revealed that the majority of the east side had been cut and filled to
103

accommodate new traffic lanes. Approximately the southern 100 m of ROW on the east side had
not been impacted by construction. This segment, however, was surveyed during the 2004
investigations, and no cultural materials were identified. Furthermore, the portion of ROW in this
area that is likely to be impacted by the proposed project occurs primarily within a drainage ditch
that parallels the road. Additional disturbances included a segment approximately 10 m long,
perhaps for a culvert, that had been excavated within the ROW on each side of the highway
approximately 120 m south of the south channel of Sanders Slough, and a buried cable that
extends between the road ditch and fence along the south 50 m of the west ROW. Two shovel
tests placed in the ROW west of the highway indicated little soil integrity in this area.
The project area was previously investigated in 2004 as the southern portion of a proposed
expansion of US 271 for the Paris District. During that survey, no evidence of 41TT2 was
identified within either the existing or proposed ROW, and the project area was given clearance
for construction. The current examination of the area indicated that the proposed construction is
underway, and cutting and filling activities have heavily impacted most of the ROW east of the
highway where the site was originally plotted. Therefore, inspection of the west side indicated
subsurface disturbance and a general absence of intact soil deposits. No settings with reasonable
potential to contain archeological deposits were noted during this evaluation. No further work
was recommended within the current APE.

SITE 41TT8 (WA 6)

Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicates that site 41TT8 is plotted near the present US 271
location and its ROW where road improvements have been proposed. When this site, as well as
site 41TT2, was originally recorded, the highway was located adjacent to the north side of the
railroad tracks, but TARL plotted the site adjacent to the present location of US 271 rather than
the original highway. Because this site was recorded in the 1930s, little information was
available through either the sites atlas or records curated at TARL. As it is mapped in the atlas,
41TT8 is a large site located on the southwest side of US 271, roughly 120 m southeast of the
channel. An old railroad grade and two structures intruded into the site according to the 1964
USGS Cuthand, TX, 7.5′ topographic quadrangle. Site 41TT8 is described as a prehistoric
campsite that contains a considerable amount of flint material and sherds. Except for a visit in
1934 when the site was presumably recorded, no known archeological investigations have
occurred.
In October 2004, Geo-Marine surveyed the current project area as part of a larger survey for the
Paris District in anticipation of a realignment and widening project (Tiné and Largent 2004). No
evidence of site 41TT8 was identified within either the existing or proposed ROW during those
investigations, and no further work was recommended for this area. TxDOT and THC concurred
with the recommendations and the road expansion was allowed to proceed.

the highway. Inspection of the west side where the site is plotted indicated subsurface
disturbance and a general absence of intact soil deposits. No settings with reasonable potential to
contain archeological deposits were noted during this evaluation. No further work was
recommended within the present APE.

SITE 41TT100 (WA 6)

Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicates that the State Department of Highways and Public
Transportation (SDHPT)—now TxDOT—recorded site 41TT100 in 1975. This site was one of
four (41TT100, 41TT101, 41TT102, and 41TT103) recorded at that time within an approximately
1.4-mile stretch of US 271.
Site 41TT100 is plotted on the east side of US 271 approximately 0.6 mile south of White Oak
Creek on a ridge extending into the flood plain. The SDHPT survey recovered several flakes and
plain pottery sherds from the surface of the site. In addition, an entire ceramic vessel was
reported found in the present roadway when US 271 was constructed in the late 1930s. No
subsurface investigations were conducted during the 1975 survey. Testing was recommended to
determine the extent of the site (Bell 1975a).
105

Current Investigations
The majority of the ridge on which site 41TT100 is located is outside of the ROW in a pasture.
The underlying geology of the area is Paleocene Midway Group undivided (BEG 1979). The
vegetation consists primarily of grasses, and mature oaks frequently line the fencerows. The
mapped soils for the area are Woodtell fine sandy loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes (Roberts 1990), and
the soils in the shovel tests generally consisted of no more than 30 cm of compact to very
compact brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy loam above a strong brown (7.5YR 5/6–5/8) clay
subsoil.
Four shovel tests were placed within the ROW near this area along the east side of US 271. The
first two shovel tests were placed just below the small ridge on which the site is located, and the
remaining two were placed on the ridge. Subsoil was encountered directly below the surface in
one shovel test, and several pieces of asphalt were found in a second shovel test 30 cm below
surface, indicating a heavy disturbance. No cultural materials were observed in any shovel test.
The existing ROW demonstrates disturbance from cutting and filling activities associated with
construction of US 271, and soil erosion was frequently observed. Consequently, the project area
possesses little soil integrity and very low potential for containing archeological materials.
Therefore, no further work was recommended for site 41TT100 within the present APE.

SITE 41TT101 (WA 6)

Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicates that SDHPT—now TxDOT—recorded site
41TT101 in 1975. This site was one of four (41TT100, 41TT101, 41TT102, and 41TT103)
recorded at that time within an approximately 1.4-mile stretch of US 271.
Site 41TT101 was identified 0.2 miles south of 41TT100, on the first prominent hill south of the
White Oak Creek flood plain, along the east side of the ROW. SDHPT investigators observed
several flakes and pottery sherds on the ground surface, and pottery was reported when US 271
was constructed. No subsurface investigations were conducted. The site form also notes that the
main site area was probably outside of the ROW in a pasture, and the portion within the ROW
was not recommended for further work due to extensive erosion (Bell 1975b).

Current Investigations
Site 41TT101 was identified 0.2 miles south of 41TT100, on the first prominent hill south of the
White Oak Creek flood plain, along the east side of the ROW. The underlying geology of the
area is Paleocene Midway Group undivided (BEG 1979). The vegetation consists primarily of
grasses, and mature oaks frequently line the fencerows. The mapped soils for the area are
Woodtell-Raine complex, 1 to 3 percent slopes (Roberts 1990), and the soils in the shovel tests
generally consisted of no more than 30 cm of compact to very compact brownish yellow (10YR
6/6) sandy loam above a strong brown (7.5YR 5/6-5/8) clay subsoil.

106

The ROW near 41TT101 has been extensively altered, and much of the landform had been
removed to the extent that it could only accommodate one shovel test in the intact ROW. A
second shovel test was placed in the ditch to determine if any deposits had washed into this area.
Both shovel tests reached subsoil within the first 15 cm below surface and neither contained
cultural materials. The only artifact encountered was a single flake eroding from the road cut at
the base of a large oak tree. A large house and associated lawn and gardens now occupy the
landform. No cultural materials were observed in any of the shovel tests.
Only one flake was recovered at site 41TT101, and it occurred in a highly disturbed context. The
majority of the existing ROW is disturbed from previous construction activities, erosion, and
grading of the ground surface. Consequently, the project area possesses little soil integrity and
very low potential for containing archeological materials; therefore, no further work was
recommended within the present APE.

SITE 41TT102 (WA 6)

Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicates that SDHPT—now TxDOT—recorded site
41TT102 in 1975. This site was one of four (41TT100, 41TT101, 41TT102, and 41TT103)
recorded at that time within an approximately 1.4-mile stretch of US 271.
Site 41TT102 was recorded 0.8 miles south of 41TT101, on the first prominent hill south of an
unnamed tributary of the Johnson Branch of Ripley Creek, along the east side of the ROW.
Prehistoric artifacts were observed and investigators collected several flakes and pottery sherds.
No subsurface investigations were conducted. The investigator also noted that the main site area
was probably outside the ROW. The portion of the site within the ROW was not recommended
for further work due to disturbances from a barn as well as several drives surrounding the
structure (Bell 1975c).

Current Investigations
The underlying geology of the area is Paleocene Midway Group undivided (BEG 1979). The
vegetation consists primarily of grasses, and mature oaks frequently line the fence rows. The
mapped soils for the area are Woodtell-Raine Complex, 1 to 3 percent slopes (Roberts 1990), and
the soils in the shovel tests generally consisted of no more than 30 cm of compact to very
compact brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy loam above a strong brown (7.5YR 5/6-5/8) clay
subsoil.
Four shovel tests were placed in the ROW along the east side of US 271 adjacent to the recorded
location of 41TT102. All units reached subsoil within 10 cm below surface, and the northern two
contained large pieces of concrete just above the subsoil. No archeological materials were
recovered from any of the shovel tests.

107

Another shovel-tested area along U.S 271 was a prominent ridge located approximately 50 m
south of the mapped location of 41TT102. Six shovel tests were placed across this landform on
the east side of the highway. All of the units reached subsoil within 30–40 cm below surface. No
cultural materials were observed in any shovel test.
The majority of the existing ROW at site 41TT102 is disturbed from previous construction
activities, erosion, and grading of the ground surface. Consequently, the project area possesses
little soil integrity and very low potential for containing archeological materials. No further work
was recommended within the present APE.

SITE 41TT103 (WA 6)

Previous Investigations
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicates that SDHPT—now TxDOT—recorded site
41TT103 in 1975. This site was one of four (41TT100, 41TT101, 41TT102, and 41TT103)
recorded at that time within an approximately 1.4-mile stretch of US 271. The main site area was
recorded outside the existing ROW.
Site 41TT103 is located, approximately 0.4 miles south of 41TT102, on a small ridge north of
Ripley Creek. SDHPT archeologists collected potsherds from the site surface, but no subsurface
investigations were conducted. Investigators recommended extensive testing of the site (Bell
1975d).

Current Investigations
The underlying geology of the area is Paleocene Midway Group undivided (BEG 1979). The
vegetation consists primarily of grasses, and mature oaks frequently line the fencerows. The
mapped soils for the area are Woodtell-Raine complex, 1 to 3 percent slopes (Roberts 1990), and
the soils in the shovel tests generally consisted of no more than 30 cm of compact to very
compact brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) sandy loam above a strong brown (7.5YR 5/6-5/8) clay
subsoil.
Two shovel tests were placed in the ROW east of US 271 in the vicinity of site 41TT103, and a
third was placed on the west side of the highway. All three were sterile and exhibited subsoil
directly beneath the ground surface. Another shovel-tested area was a prominent ridge located
approximately 200 m north of the site (between sites 41TT102 and 41TT103). Six shovel tests
were placed across this landform on the east side of US 271. All units reached subsoil within 30–
40 cm below surface. No cultural materials were observed in any shovel test.
The majority of the existing ROW at site 41TT103 is disturbed from previous construction
activities, erosion, and grading of the ground surface. Consequently, the project area possesses
little soil integrity and very low potential for containing archeological materials. No further work
was recommended within the present APE.

CHAPTER 6
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

RESULTS
Twenty-nine work authorizations were issued under TxDOT Contract No. 575 xx SA010 (see
Table 2): three impact evaluations, 19 archeological surveys, two scopes of work (testing
strategies for prehistoric sites 41COL172/41COL173 and 41DL203), one testing project (sites
41COL172 and 41COL173), and one archival research project; two work authorizations were
cancelled prior to initiation of work, and the final work authorization consisted of production of
this report. The work was conducted in the TxDOT districts of Atlanta, Dallas, Lufkin, Paris, and
Tyler under THC Antiquities Permit 4068. Individual interim reports were coordinated with the
THC through TxDOT Environmental Affairs Division. Artifact collections taken from state
property and from private property with the landowner’s consent and all associated notes and
materials are curated at TARL, University of Texas at Austin.
Twenty-eight sites were investigated during this contract (see Table 4). Preliminary archival
research revealed 20 sites plotted within or adjacent to highway ROWs within proposed project
areas. Fourteen of these sites (41AG180, 41DN445, 41DN446, 41MR99, 41SA29, 41SA218,
41SA219, 41SB72, 41TT2, 41TT8, 41TT100, 41TT101, 41TT102, and 41TT103) were not found
because they had been completely destroyed within the ROW, did not extend into the ROW, or
were misplotted on TARL maps.
Fourteen sites were revisited or newly recorded. Six previously recorded sites (41COL172,
41COL173, 41DL203, 41MR64, 41MX55, and 41MX141) were found (41DL203 has been
previously recorded but not yet investigated; one work authorization under this current contract
addressed the testing scope of work for this site), and eight sites (41AG194, 41AN162, 41AN173,
41CE404, 41CE405, 41FK121, 41FK122, and 41HU80) were newly identified and recorded. Of
these 14 sites (or portions of sites) that were identified within areas of potential effects, seven
(41AN173, 41CE404, 41COL172, 41COL173, 41DL203, 41FK121, and 41MX141) contained
only prehistoric artifacts; three sites (41CE405, 41HU80, and 41MR64) contained only historicage artifacts; and four sites (41AG194, 41AN162, 41FK122, and 41MX55) contained both
prehistoric and historic material.

109

Ten of the 14 sites (41AN162, 41AN173, 41CE404, 41COL172, 41COL173, 41DL203,
41FK121, 41FK122, 41MR64, and 41MX55) exhibit only subsurface cultural material; four
(41AG194, 41CE405, 41HU80, and 41MX141) produced primarily subsurface material, but at
least one artifact was found on the surface of each. At sites 41CE405 and 41HU80, historic-age
structural remains were present as well.
Although previous mechanical trenching identified sites 41COL172 and 41COL173 (Sills et al.
2005), current trenching efforts identified no sites. Typically, fewer mechanical trenches per acre
than shovel tests per acre were excavated. The negative assessment of these trenched project
areas for intact cultural deposits, however, is most likely accurate due to the large vertical and
horizontal exposure of sediments achieved by applying this excavation method.
Of the 28 sites investigated under this contract, further testing was recommended for seven sites
within the proposed areas of potential effects: new sites 41AN173 (prehistoric), and 41AG194
and 41AN162 (both multicomponent); and previously recorded sites 41MX55 (multicomponent),
sites 41COL172 and 41COL173 (prehistoric, scope of work developed and sites tested under this
contract), and 41DL203 (prehistoric, scope of work developed under this contract; testing under a
separate contract). Further archival research only was suggested for site 41CE405. There was no
evidence of 14 of the previously recorded sites within the APEs (see Table 4). No further
archeological investigations were considered warranted for the remaining seven sites within the
investigated proposed project APEs.
EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION OF STRATEGIES
In most cases, impact evaluations are conducted prior to a full archeological survey involving
shovel testing, mechanical trenching, or a combination of both. If observations made during the
evaluation effort reveal extensive natural and man-made disturbances that preclude the presence
of archeological historic properties or state archeological landmarks and thus obviate the
necessity for an intensive survey, the impact evaluation is often the only archeological field
assessment that many project areas undergo. Conversely, when survey is warranted, gathering
information based on impact evaluations expedites intensive survey planning through project
area-specific information, even when large tracts of new ROW necessitate mechanical trenching.
The location of utilities, the number and placement of trenches, soil and geological contexts, and
access restrictions—all information germane to the survey—can be predetermined with an impact
evaluation. For impact evaluations to be effective, however, researchers must have specific
project descriptions, scaled drawings, and right-of-entry to any new ROW, which, unfortunately,
is not the case in some project areas. However, for proposed project areas where access has been
denied, the impact evaluation can still be a valuable tool in determining whether or not an
intensive survey is warranted for that property through observations taken from adjacent areas.
An archeological survey usually follows an impact evaluation. Information from the impact
evaluation often results in intensive archeological survey of only short segments of a proposed
highway or road project where there is potential for, or existence of, archeological deposits or
sites rather than an intensive survey of the entire project APE. As with impact evaluations,
specific project descriptions and scaled drawings as well as right-of-entry are necessary,
particularly when conducting investigations in unassessed areas of proposed APEs outside of
preexisting ROWs. All shovel testing and trenching projects are conducted within the current
Council of Texas Archeologists guidelines as approved by THC, and archeological sites are
normally found at this level of investigation. Sites can be assessed and recommendations made
for either no further work or for testing to determine NRHP eligibility and/or SAL designation.
110

The survey efforts summarized in this report reinforce two aspects of archeological properties
within existing highway ROWs: (1) the previous disturbance related to road construction, utility
trenches, and maintenance often destroys the contextual integrity of site contexts; and (2) the
plotting of sites recorded long ago is often inaccurate. If one removes the previously recorded
sites from the APEs that were surveyed, the survey of 11 geographically distinct areas yielded a
total of eight new sites (41AG194, 41AN162, 41AN173, 41CE404, 41CE405, 41FK121,
41FK122, and 41HU80). Of these eight sites, sites 41AG194, 41AN162, 41AN173 (scraping for
subsurface features), and 41CE405 (archival research only) were deemed worthy of additional
investigations. The remaining sites lacked sufficient contextual integrity to warrant additional
investigations. Of the 17 previously recorded sites located along existing ROWs, no evidence of
14 of the sites (see Table 4) was found within the APE. The remaining three sites were
considered to have limited research potential.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Several recommendations can be made to promote a more consistent return of the necessary
information from the field. Some recommendations reiterate similar recommendations offered in
previous summary reports (e.g., Largent et al. 2005; Peukert et al. 2003; Phillips et al. 2007; and
Wurtz et al. 2003), but they bear repeating:
1. Clear rights-of-entry should be obtained in advance for all privately owned portions of the
proposed project areas. In many cases, right-of-entry has not been obtained at the time of
evaluation or survey, limiting the effectiveness of the investigations and making it
impossible to identify new sites or reexamine previously recorded sites and structures.
2. Gathering available map and archival information prior to fieldwork and a subsequent
recommendation is essential for a cost-effective approach. Many of the work authorizations
under this contract involved an APE with previously recorded sites that needed to be
revisited to determine their existence/condition/eligibility status. Thus, literature and sites
atlas research related to site locations is imperative for gathering known data and identifying
plotted locations of previously known sites. Five new historic-era sites or site components
were recorded during the current contract. To facilitate location and identification of
potential historic-era sites and structures within the ROW or APE during fieldwork, review
of The Texas Historic Overlay (Foster et al. 2006) and a review of both current and early
editions of topographic, soils, and county road maps prior to undertaking an impact
evaluation or archeological survey remains essential. In instances where historic-era cultural
remains are encountered, additional resources/archives may also warrant careful
examination.
3. Impact evaluations remain an essential tool for identifying areas for survey, trenching, or
both, as well as for clearing specific areas for additional construction projects. Only three
work authorizations under this contract were issued for impact evaluations. These
evaluations were undertaken to identify any remaining relevant areas for survey or trenching
(e.g., undeveloped, undisturbed areas) and to clear previously surveyed areas for specific,
relatively low-impact projects (e.g., safety end treatments for bridges).

111

4. Survey remains essential in locating sites within project areas. The majority of work
authorizations under the current contract were for survey. Many of the investigations
focused specifically on revisiting plotted locations of previously known sites to determine
their existence and status, although eight new sites were identified through survey in
primarily newly acquired property in unassessed areas. Nevertheless, information derived
from examination of the 102 archeological sites known to have been recorded in the 437
project areas examined under contracts 570 xx PD002 (Wurtz et al. 2003), 570 xx PD003
(Peukert et al. 2003), 572 xx SA012 (Largent et al. 2005), 574 xx SA004 (Phillips et al.
2007), and this current contract 575 xx SA010 indicates that sites are rare, occurring in
approximately 23 percent of the project areas examined. This relatively low site
representation is due to the limited impact area of many of the proposed projects; previous
extensive disturbance of the existing ROWs; and the presence of the project areas on loworder streams.
5. Even though mechanical trenching may have been over-recommended in previous
investigations, trenching remains essential in settings likely to retain deeply buried, intact
cultural deposits. Two sites (41COL172 and 41COL173) were discovered only through
mechanical trenching during a previous survey by Sills et al. (2005). Both sites are deeply
buried in flood plain settings of Holocene alluvium. Testing during this contract revealed
intact, deeply buried features, living surfaces, copious amounts of highly preserved faunal
remains, and datable botanical material. The failure of trenching to identify cultural sites is
most likely due to the inaccurate assessment of alluvial deposits for the potential presence of
archeological deposits or paleosols. High-energy depositional environments (sands and
cobbles) and very low-energy depositional environments (back swamp/slack water) are
unlikely to contain intact archeological deposits and should be evaluated as such.
Evaluation could be partly achieved by close inspection of stream cutbanks. Then,
mechanical trenching can be judiciously focused in areas that exhibit environments with the
potential to retain deeply buried deposits. Determining the need for mechanical trenching to
assess the potential for buried archeological deposits is dependent upon the following:
♦ Experience

of the project archeologist within the region, especially knowledge of
geologic and pedologic processes. The forces of wind, water, and gravity throughout
the Holocene period have moved the sandy soils of East Texas. The mechanical
trenching conducted under this contract revealed that flood plain environments in East
Texas are frequently very dynamic with little potential for the preservation of
archeological contexts. Toe slopes adjacent to valley walls and the slopes of flood plain
rises are probably the primary areas that should be of concern within the East Texas
drainages. Too frequently, archeologists merely assume that a fluvial environment is
conducive to site preservation and that all fluvial deposits must be examined for buried
archeological contexts.
of prior impacts. Conducting these investigations over the length of the
contract clearly revealed that highway ROWs can be disturbed in a number of ways and
that new modifications will not necessarily affect previously undisturbed deposits.

♦ Recognition

In summary, because of Geo-Marine’s experience in undertaking these kinds of projects for
TxDOT, the results of the mechanical trenching indicate that recommendations for trenching
are often too conservative. Admittedly, one is dealing with probabilities, but the proper
balance of experience, knowledge of depositional environments, and a realistic evaluation of
existing and potential impacts should result in an efficient evaluation that will not jeopardize
historic properties.

APPENDIX A
GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS

Adze: Tool whose cutting edge is at a right angle to the handle and that is used in working wood.
Area of potential effects (APE): “Area of potential effects means the geographic area or areas
within which an undertaking may directly or indirectly cause changes in the character or use
of historic properties, if any such properties exist. The area of potential effects is influenced
by the scale and nature of an undertaking and may be different for different kinds of effects
caused by the undertaking” [36 CFR Part 800.16(d)]. Essentially, the area of potential effects
(APE) is the area of reasonably anticipated project impacts and is actually three-dimensional,
consisting of length, width, and depth.
Arrow point: Point used to tip an arrow, which is propelled by a bow.
Biface: Piece of conchoidally fracturing stone that has had flakes removed from both faces to
create a tool.
Burin: Chisel-like tool presumed to have been used in working bone, antler, and wood.
Dart point: Point used to tip a throwing spear or dart, which is propelled by an atlatl.
Debitage: Debris generated by the removal through percussion/pressure of flakes, chips, and
chunks to make stone tools.
Fill section: Introduced fill used to elevate the approaches to a bridge above the surrounding
terrain.
Flake: Generally thin piece of conchoidally fractured stone with a positive bulb of percussion
showing that it was removed from the parent piece by percussion/pressure.
Gouge: Generally thick, bifacially modified tool presumed to have been used like an adze.
Grog: Crushed fired clay added as temper to clay used in making ceramic vessels.
Historic property: “Historic property means any prehistoric or historic district, site, building,
structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic
Places maintained by the Secretary of the Interior. This term includes artifacts, records, and
remains that are related to and located within such properties. The term includes properties
of traditional religious and cultural importance to an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian
organization and that meet the National Register criteria. The term eligible for inclusion in
the National Register includes both properties formally determined as such in accordance
with regulations of the Secretary of the Interior and all other properties that meet the National
Register criteria” [36 CFR 800.16(l)]. Essentially, a historic property is a cultural resource
included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places.
Impact Evaluation: Onsite inspection documenting existing impacts or other conditions that
may preclude the presence of intact archeological deposits within the project area for a
proposed Transportation Activity.
Mano: Handheld stone used, usually with a metate, to grind plant parts such as seeds.

A-3

Megafauna: Particularly large animal such as bison and mammoth.
Metate: Anvil of stone used, usually with a mano, to grind plant parts such as seeds.
Midden: Accumulation of occupational debris, particularly organic remains.
Projectile point: Inclusive term for arrow and dart points.
Scraper: Tool with generally thick, unifacially modified edges used to work hides, bone, and
wood.
Sherd: A piece of broken pottery.
State Archeological Landmark (SAL): The Texas Historical Commission “uses one or more of
the following criteria when assessing the appropriateness of official landmark designation,
and/or the need for further investigations under the permit process:
(1) the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
(2) the site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
(3) the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
(4) the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
(5) the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to insure [sic] maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected” [Texas Administrative Code (13
TAC Part 2.§26.8)]. Essentially, a state archeological landmark (SAL) is the state
equivalent of a historic property.
Survey: Fieldwork to locate archeological remains within the project area for a proposed
Transportation Activity, including on-foot examination of the surface, shovel testing, and
trenching by mechanical means where appropriate.
Survey with Geoarcheological Evaluation: Fieldwork to locate archeological remains within
the project area for a proposed Transportation Activity, including examination and recording
of trench walls or other exposures by a geomorphologist, quaternary geologist, physical
geographer, soil scientist, or archeologist with the formal training and experience to apply the
principles of geology to the evaluation of the pedological, stratigraphic, geomorphic,
anthrogenic, and other conditions affecting the physical integrity of archeological deposits
and the interpretation of archeological materials.
Temper: Nonplastic materials added to clay to decrease the risk of cracking when firing ceramic
vessels.
Transportation Activity: Any proposed project involving the development, design, construction,
or maintenance of the state’s intermodal transportation system.
