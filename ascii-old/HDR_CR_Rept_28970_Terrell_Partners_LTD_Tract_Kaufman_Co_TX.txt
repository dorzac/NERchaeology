ABSTRACT
An archeological reconnaissance survey was conducted on a ca. 255.68-acre tract of land located
ca. 0.25 miles west of Terrell, Texas. The purpose of the survey was to identify and assess
cultural resources that may be impacted by proposed development of the tract, and to provide
this information in support of a Section 404 permit application. The survey included a pedestrian
reconnaissance of two natural headwater drainages located on the tract as well as the
examination of three upland areas where records indicate the location of possible historic
structures. The reconnaissance survey of the tract resulted in documenting a number of existing
impacts to include the presence of buried gas pipelines, overhead power lines, past cultivation,
stock pond construction, and utility development within the tract. A domestic scatter of historic
debris including ceramics, glass, and architectural materials dating to the early to mid 20th
Century was recorded along the western edge of the tract, and was registered by the state as site
number 41KF136. The site was not recommended as being eligible for the National Register of
Historic Places due to its low density of materials, apparent lack of integrity, and lack of unique
character.

Introduction
Terrell Partnerâs Ltd. is proposing to develop a 255.68 acre tract of land located ca. 0.25
miles west of Terrell, Texas and just north of the intersection of FM 148 and IH 20
(Figure 1). In doing so, it was identified that they would have to apply for a Section 404
permit from the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District to place fill within
Waters of the United States. In support of their permit application, a cultural resources
investigation was undertaken to fulfill the regulatory requirements of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act.
The focus of this investigation is to identify and provide information that will facilitate
the Fort Worth Districtâs assessment of potential impacts to cultural resources within the
proposed tract. This was accomplished by reviewing available information on known
cultural resources within the vicinity of the project area, and conducting an archeological
reconnaissance survey of designated areas within the tract to document disturbances and
record cultural resource sites. Eric Schroeder of HDR Engineering, Inc. conducted the
reconnaissance survey on August 30-31, 2005 and expended a total of 6 man-hours in the
field.
Environmental and Cultural Background
The Terrell Partners Ltd. tract is located within the northern Blackland Prairies of the
Gulf Coastal Plains Province of Texas. The Blackland Prairies exhibit low rolling terrain
that is underlain by chalks and marls that weather to deep, black fertile clay soils (BEG,
1988). Major rivers that occur within the northern Blackland Prairies include the Red
River to the north, the headwaters of the Trinity River to the west and south, the upper
Sulphur River to the northeast, and the upper Sabine River to the east. Today, much of
the northern Blackland Prairies is cleared of most natural vegetation and cultivated for
crops. During prehistoric times the northern Blackland Prairies consisted primarily of
open grassland interspersed with woodlands dominated by oaks. By around 1,500 years
ago, a gradual warming and drying trend is identified by fossil pollen evidence,
suggesting that the woodland areas shrank giving way to the expansion of the present
post-oak savanna (Bryant and Holloway, 1985).
Previous archeological investigations have documented human settlement in the northern
Blackland Prairies going back as far as 11,500 years ago. However, there is very little
specific information about these cultures and much of what we know about them is
primarily derived from archeological investigations conducted in the Midwestern and
Southwestern regions of the United States. This regional information appears to indicate
that during the period between 11,500 to around 3,500 years ago human populations were
organized as small bands engaged in the hunting of wild game and the gathering of wild
plant foods. The archeological information appears to indicate that human populations
gradually shifted its technology from one based primarily on hunting to one based more
on gathering. This technological shift was probably caused by an increase in population
densities, followed by a less nomadic mobility. These factors probably led to the
intensification of resource exploitation and the shrinking of group territories (Story,
1

2

1990:213). Most of what is known about these early cultures in the study area stems
from projectile point finds by private collectors, which were reported as being found
within the Trinity and Sulphur river basins. Although some sites in the study area are
known to have deposits that represent this timeframe, these were mostly found to be
mixed with other cultural deposits from later periods (Table 1). Of the few sites where
isolable components were found, include the Paleoindian deposits recovered at the
Lewisville site and the Aubrey site, both of which are located within the upper Trinity
River basin in Denton County, Texas. The only other site having isolable components
representative of this timeframe include Late Archaic components at site 41TR63 in the
upper Trinity River Basin in Tarrant County (cf. Story, 1990; Prikryl, 1990).

The first 10,000 years of Native American prehistory within the Blackland Prairie of
North-central Texas appears to be a time when hunting was the initial focus of
subsistence pursuits, with gathering becoming increasingly more important through time.
By about 1,300 BP aboriginal pottery appears in the region along with the bow and
arrow. The latter development is indicated by the presence of smaller projectile points
within archeological assemblages. By about 1000 BP corn shows up in the regional
archeological record (Peter and McGregor, 1988:165). The remains of structures have
also been found along Richland Creek, at a site on the East Fork of the Trinity, and a site
at Lake Ray Roberts (Table 2) (Prikryl, 1990).
Between 750-250 BP a Plains Indian tool assemblage becomes more and more prolific
with the region. Bison hunting appears to be increasing in importance, as a number of
kill sites have been found in the region. However, the presence of bison-scapula hoes
and bone digging implements at other sites indicates a concomitant importance in
3

farming as well. There are about 36 sites reported within the region that date to this
period, but few have been studied in detail.

There is little evidence to support patterns of human occupation during the early historic
period when Europeans first come into contact with native groups in the region around
the early 1700s. All that is known about this period is a few clay pipe fragments found at
two sites along the Trinity River basin in Dallas and Denton counties (Prikryl, 1990).
The Spanish and French never settled the Blackland Prairies of north-central Texas, but
did exert influence over the native populations through trade and warfare. Although there
were Spanish missions in East Texas as early as 1690, the only concerted attempt the
Spanish made to settle the Blackland Prairie was the San Xavier missions in 1745 and
1747, which were located way to the south of the study area within the middle Brazos
drainage basin. Later, the townsite of Bucareli was established on the San AntonioNacogdoches Road near a ford on the Trinity as a result of the Spanish abandonment of
the missions in East Texas in 1772. The settlers of Bucareli were reported to consist of a
mixed cultural group comprised of Spanish, French and Creole people, who likely
engaged in black market trade with native groups of the area. This townsite on the lower
Trinity was only in existence for around 5 years, until it was uprooted and moved to
found the modern town of Nacogdoches in 1779 (Amsbury, 1993a).
North-central Texas remained virtually unsettled by Europeans until statehood. Anglo
settlement along the Trinity River focused around springs with townsites like Buckner,
and McKinney. By the late 1800s north-central Texas was comprised mostly of cattle
range with a minor amount of farming. Originally about a third of Kaufman County was
timbered and the main economy of the early settlers was based on livestock. By 1850 the
amount of improved land was a little less than 3000 acres; while later in 1860 it had
increased to just shy of 13,000 acres (Amsbury, 1993b).

Record Search and Survey Design
Records regarding known archeological sites were examined at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) at Austin, and although there are no previously recorded
archeological sites recorded within the subject tract, there are ca. 135 archeological sites
recorded for Kaufman County. The nearest recorded sites to the subject tract occur
approximately 1.25 miles east along Bachelor Creek. However, Bachelor Creek is a
considerably higher order stream than Little Brushy Creek, and therefore is not a suitable
model for comparison. On the subject tract, Little Brushy Creek and the tributary
drainage are both headwater tributaries or first order streams. Examination of other first
order, or headwater streams, on the Terrell South 7.5 minute quadrangle on file at TARL
indicated that none of the known sites occur along headwater streams. This information
would indicate that there is a lack of precedence for the presence of archeological sites
within natural settings that are similar to that found in the subject tract.
A review of the Terrell south 7.5 minute quadrangle indicates the presence of three
uninhabited structures within the tract. Since the Terrell South quadrangle indicates that
the structures are uninhabited, they may either represent abandoned houses, or an
unoccupied outbuilding, such as a barn etc. One of the structures is located in the far
west corner of the property, while two are shown within the eastern half of the tract. The
1936 State Highway Map for Kaufman County shows that these structures were inhabited
in 1936.
The surface geology of the tract is mapped as Naylandville Marl, and is Cretaceous in
age. Soils that form in the Naylandville Marl within the subject tract includes Wilson
silty clay, 0-1 percent slope; Wilson silty loam, 1-3 percent slopes; Wilson clay loam 2-5
percent slopes eroded; Maybank fine sandy loam, 0-1 percent slope and 1-3 percent
slopes and Crockett fine sandy loam. All of these soils form in upland topography within
alkaline marine clays and shales (Pringle, 1977). This information would indicate that if
any archeological sites were located within the subject tract, that they would likely be
visible along the surface provided that ground surface visibility is at least 70 percent or
greater.
In summary, the records search indicates that it is unlikely that significant prehistoric
cultural deposits occur within proposed tract, and that a surface reconnaissance of the
drainage areas would be sufficient to confirm this conclusion. Furthermore, based on the
evidence that historic structures or archeological sites may occur within the tract, the
surface reconnaissance included the inspection of the three unoccupied structures
indicated on the Terrell South quadrangle. Along the headwater drainages, the surface
reconnaissance included an inspection of the ground surface within 200â either side of the
channel for the entire length of the drainage within the tract, while a 1 acre area was
surveyed in the vicinity of each uninhabited structure shown on the Terrell South
quadrangle (Figure 2). Impacts observed within the tract were noted and examination of
subsurface conditions within the tract was collected from erosional cut-banks exposed
along the channel and the excavation of a limited number of shovel tests.

Survey Results
The 255 acre tract is located ca. 0.25 miles west of the City of Terrel and just north of the
intersection of FM 148 and IH 20. Most, if not all, of the property has been under
cultivation and is presently covered by stands of broomweed, silverleaf nightshade, and
space grasses. The ground was dry and large cracks were observed along the ground
surface over much of the tract. Two headwater drainages extend along a general northsouth transect across the eastern and western edges of the property. The drainage in the
west is named Little Brushy Creek, while the drainage to the east is an unnamed tributary
of the latter. The topography is generally flat, but a gentle downward gradient occurs
from north to south. The highest elevation is in the northern portion of the tract at ca. 495
feet above mean sea level (amsl), while the lowest portion of the tract is in the southern
portion of the tract at ca. 468 ft amsl.
Other than past cultivation, impacts observed within the western part of the tract include
a buried high pressure gas pipeline, a high voltage overhead power line, and severe
alteration of the southern 1/3rd of the Little Brushy Creek channel (Figure 3). The latter
impact appears to be previous modification of the lower 1/3rd of the Little Brushy Creek
channel to construct the nearby stock pond (Figure 4). Impacts observed within the
eastern half of the tract include the construction of a multi-lane overpass of IH 20, which
passes through the southeastern corner of the tract (Figure 5). In addition, the tributary
drainage has been mechanically altered and rechannelized (Figure 6). Fill has been
placed in a 5 to 6 acre area along the eastern boundary of the tract, and buried utilities
have been installed (Figure 7). The area east of the tributary drainage and south of the
filled area is rutted by heavy equipment tracks.
Little Brushy Creek
The northern 2/3rds of the Little Brushy Creek channel is incised ca. 1 meter into the
surrounding bedrock. Ground surface visibility along the banks of the channel is ca. 5060 percent, and comprised of a pale brown sandy loam with few siliceous pebbles along
the surface of the northern 1/3rd of the drainage. Downstream in the middle 1/3rd, this
sandy unit pinches out and a gray clay loam with few to common siliceous pebbles
dominates the ground surface. A shovel test was conducted in this portion of the
drainage and it consisted of a 10 cm thick zone of pale brown sandy loam with strong,
medium to coarse blocky structure with ca. 70 percent CaCO3 films. This abruptly
graded to a 50 cm thick dark gray clay loam that exhibited very strong, medium to coarse
prismatic structure, few siliceous pebbles, and common medium CaCO3 stains.
Within the middle 1/3rd of the drainage and under a grove of elm and live oak trees was a
modern trash dump. The dump consisted of at least two piles of concrete fragments,
center block fragments, steal pipe segments, and brick fragments (Figure 8). The
apparent purpose of the dump is likely to curtail erosion. Approximately 30 meters
southwest of the dump, there is a barn structure. The barn structure measures ca. 30ft x
20ft and is constructed of corrugated sheet metal with a wooden frame. Its apparent use
is to store hay (Figure 9).

Tributary of Little Brushy Creek
The channel of the tributary has been altered to some degree such that it was difficult to
recognize its original configuration. The ground surface in the vicinity of the tributary
drainage is visible at a frequency of ca. 50 to 60 percent. The surface is pale brown
sandy loam with few siliceous pebbles. While walking the channel, a geologic exposure
was observed. It consisted of 0-120cm of gray clay loam that abruptly graded into a light
gray to yellowish-brown sandy clay with common olive and reddish-brown mottles down
to a depth of 170 cm below surface. A fragment of whiteware and a fragment of milk
glass were observed along the bottom of the channel
Possible Historic Site Location 1
According to the 1962 U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle there is an
uninhabited structure mapped in the far western corner of the tract. The 1936 State
Highway Map indicates that at that time the structure was inhabited. Upon visiting the
site area a small surface scatter of historic domestic debris was observed along the
surface (Figure 10). Materials observed include several brick fragments, a metal truss
jointer, a few metal fragments, domestic ceramics and various colors and types of glass.
Solared purple bottle glass was present and indicates that the scatter dates at least to the
early 20th Century. This scatter was recorded as site 41KF136.
Possible Historic Site Location 2
Also indicated on the 1962 U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle, examination of
this area found a single brick fragment and a fire-cracked rock, all within a 50 m x 50 m
area. Conducted a shovel test in the vicinity ad encountered 0-10 cm of firm pale brown
sandy loam that abruptly graded to a very strong gray clay. No indication of cultural
materials within the subsurface was found. An informant, Mr. Shane Knox, was
interviewed about the structure that apparently once stood in this location. He noted that
he lived in the house that once stood there, and that it was moved to this location from
Dallas around the 1960âs. He noted that it was a wood framed structure having composite
shingles as siding and paneling on the walls in the inside.
Possible Historic Site Location 3
Visited the location of a possible historic site indicated as an uninhabited structure on the
1962 U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle, and found the remain of a pole barn
(Figure 11). Materials scattered along the surface around the structure included plastic
jugs, wafer board, and non-dimensional lumber. Sheet metal and barb wire litter the 30
m x 30 m area around the structure. There were no artifacts older than 1980 observed in
the area of the structure.

Site Description 41KF136
A scatter of historic domestic debris was observed along the surface within the far
western corner of the tract, and was recorded as site 41KF136. The site is located within
a cleared field ca. Â¾ mile northwest along County Road 305 from its intersection with IH
20, and situated along a relatively level upland ridge top that is the divide between Little
Brushy Creek to the east and Terry Creek to the west. Resting at an elevation of ca. 495
feet above sea level, the surrounding area is an open field covered in domestic grasses
and native forbs with ground surface visibility at ca. 70-80 percent.
The artifact scatter consists of several brick fragments, metal fragments, a metal truss
joiner, earthenware, milk glass, whiteware, glazed stoneware, brown, clear and green
bottle glass, a copper pipe, solared purple bottle glass, and a marble. These materials
occurred within an area measuring ca. 1000 m2 in size, with an artifact density of ca. 1
artifact every 4 m2. The artifacts observed appear to indicate that the site represents the
remains of a former housesite as indicated on the 1962 U.S.G.S. 7.5 minute Terrell
Quadrangle. The artifact materials suggest a period of occupation from as early as the
early 20th century.
Mr. David Roffino, an informant who as a boy remembered a two-room wood frame
house once stood on the site back in the late 1960âs and 1970âs. He noted that during the
time his father owned the property, from the 1950s to the 1980âs, that it was never lived
in, and that it burned around the mid-1970âs.
Conclusions and Recommendations
The survey of the drainages and cultural features on the Terrell Partners, L.L.C. tract
resulted in the documentation of a modern trash dump, a modern pole barn, and the
recording of a historic domestic scatter. No evidence of prehistoric occupation was found
within the areas surveyed. The historic domestic scatter was recorded as site 41KF136
and based on the evidence, is believed to represent the remains of a two-room wood
frame house, possibly a tenant farmstead, dating to the early 20th century. An unoccupied
structure is mapped within the area of the site on the Terrell South 7.5 minute quadrangle
that was originally published in 1962, suggesting that by that time the housesite had been
abandoned. The archeological materials are scattered across the surface of a Cretaceousaged landform that has been plowed for several decades. Tenant farming during this
period has been well document for the Blackland Prairie (rf. Sharpless, 1993), and it is
unlikely that any additional information than what has already been collected at the site
could add to this. Under these circumstances it would appear that this development
activity would have no effect to historic properties that are listed or eligible for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places. Not further archeological investigations are
recommended.
