ABSTRACT

An 8.9-acre tract located west of Lancaster Road and south of Fivemile
Creek in South Dallas is the proposed site of the Magnolia Trace
Development where 112 residential units are to be built. This is an area of
low prehistoric archaeological potential based on its location in the
Blackland Prairie and its distance from a narrow riparian environment that
is along an unnamed intermittent tributary that drains north into Ricketts
Branch and from there into Fivemile Creek. Furthermore, historic maps
and records showed no evidence that the area was occupied in the late
1800s or in the 1900s although it most certainly was farmed. A pedestrian
survey of the tract and a surrounding buffer strip failed to find any
evidence of significant historic or prehistoric occupation or utilization.
The survey confirms the predicted low archaeological potential of the
tract. Based on the negative findings of the survey, AR Consultants
recommends that property development proceed as planned.

INTRODUCTION
An undeveloped tract of land including 8.9 acres and located on the south side of Crouch
Road in South Dallas was studied to determine if it contained any significant cultural
resources that might be impacted by the planned construction of the Magnolia Trace
Apartments. The tract is the study area and the Area of Potential Effect (APE) which is
situated near the base of the upland slope about a quarter of a mile east of an unnamed
second order intermittent tributary of Ricketts Branch. The north edge of the tract
parallels Crouch Road for a distance of five hundred feet and extends southeast and
perpendicular to the road for a distance of nine hundred feet. A fifty foot wide buffer
zone surrounding the tract was also surveyed for cultural resources but testing was not
done in the buffer zone.

The present investigation was done at the request of the Archeology Division of the
Texas Historical Commission because they considered this a Section 106 action of the
National Historic Preservation Act. The project involves governmental funds and this
triggered the State Historic Preservation Officer’s federal review process. The Texas
Antiquities Code does not apply to this project.

NATURAL AND CULTURAL SETTING
The Austin Chalk (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972) underlies all of the survey area as
well as the ridge to the to the east and adjacent parts of the upland that were covered with
Blackland Prairie until farming began and settlers built roads that criss-crossed the
landscape (Allen and Flanigan 1986).
The entire study area is located within an upland soil association known as the EddyStephen-Austin Soil Association (Coffee, Hill, and Ressel 1980:General Soil Map). This
general region is characterized as having very shallow, shallow, and moderately deep
generally sloping to moderately steep, loamy and clayey upland soils. More specifically,
the upslope or eastern part of the survey area coincides with Sunev clay loam with 3-8
percent slopes (Coffee et al. 1980:Sheet 53). The western part is almost encircled by the
Sunev clay loam and is termed Lewisville silty clay with 1 to 3 percent slopes. Just to the
west and in the floodplain of the unnamed tributary of Ricketts Branch is occasionally
flooded Frio silty clay. Frio-Urban land complex is mapped on both sides of the creek.
The Sunev clay loam soil has an A-horizon that is up to 12 inches thick and dark grayish
brown in color. It has a smooth gradual boundary into the brown clay loam B-horizon
which extends to depths of more than 65 inches in places. Lewisville silty clay has a 15
inch thick A-horizon that is dark grayish brown and has a gradual smooth boundary into
the B-horizon that is grayish brown to 23 inches and light yellowish brown below. The
Frio has a thick A-horizon that is very dark grayish brown silty clay to depths of 53
inches and then blocky and brown silty clay loam extends from 53 inches to at least 74
inches. These soil colors are those present when the soil is moist or saturated as they are
at present. Other soil associations in the adjacent area include the Trinity-Frio association
along Fivemile Creek, Ricketts Branch and along the unnamed tributary that empties into
Ricketts Branch in the nearby flood plain. The more level and higher uplands include the
Austin-Houston Black soil association.
The study area is situated entirely within the Blackland Prairie physiographic province
(Diamond, Riskind and Orzell 1987:Figure 1). The Blackland Prairie may be generally
described as a medium tall, rather dense grassland, dominated by little bluestem and
Texas needlegrass (Kuchler 1964:76). Small stands of timber (elm, oak, pecan, etc.) are
present in the prairie also. Although situated in the Blackland Prairie, the study area also
lies within the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950), which although rich in flora, features
relatively low biotic diversity. Forty-nine species of mammals occur in the Texan
province, including deer, raccoon, rabbits and opossum. The local riparian environment
features a more diverse biotic setting, with forty-one of the aforementioned mammals, six
of the nine lizards, both terrapin species and twenty-seven of the snake species present in
a riparian setting.
The climate in Dallas County is generally mild, featuring hot summers and cool winters
punctuated by occasional surges of cold air and plummeting temperature. Average daily
temperature is 66.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Rainfall is uniformly distributed throughout the
year, though peaking in spring. Average yearly rainfall is 36.06 inches (Coffee et al.

1980). Elevation along the Fivemile Creek flood plain is 440 feet, while the elevation in
the level uplands within the study area is 467 feet. This relative similarity in elevation
results in poor drainage of the upland, and areas of standing water on the ground surface.
The archaeology of North Central Texas has been the major focus of avocational
archaeologists since before the Great Depression, and in the past 40 years professional
archaeologists have been present in the area to lend their support and encouragement to
the development of a cultural historical framework within which to place archaeological
sites. Daniel Prikryl (1990) examined artifact collections from known sites in the area of
the Lower Elm Fork and conducted site surveys in the preparation of his Master's thesis.
Prikryl's thesis focuses on the locations and types of sites during six prehistoric time
periods which are outlined below (Table 1). It should be noted that two additional time
periods, Historic Native American and Historic European, have been added to Prikryl’s
periods.
Table 1.

Cultural chronological time periods for North Central Texas,
given as years before present (BP).
Historic European-------------150 BP-present
Historic Native American-----250-150 BP
Late Prehistoric II-------------- 750-250 BP
Late Prehistoric I---------------1250-750 BP
Late Archaic--------------------3500-1250 BP
Middle Archaic-----------------6000-3500 BP
Early Archaic-------------------8500-6000 BP
Paleo-Indian ------------------- pre-8500 BP

The Paleo-Indian period is known in the area primarily on the basis of distinctive spear
points that have been associated with now-extinct mammals elsewhere in the Southwest
and on the High Plains. These points include Clovis, Dalton, Plainview, and several
others, although Dalton and Plainview are the most common types reported by Prikryl.
Two sites in nearby Denton County have been dated to this period. These are the
Lewisville site, which is under Lake Lewisville, and the Aubrey site, which is on the Elm
Fork of the Trinity River below the Lake Ray Roberts dam. Both sites occur in deeply
buried flood plain deposits and both are associated with Clovis spear points (Crook and
Harris 1957; Ferring 2001). Most of the Paleo-Indian sites reported by Prikryl are located
on terraces above the flood plain, and almost all of the artifact collections are associated
with more recently dated materials. Based on the fact that almost all of the tools from
Paleo-Indian sites are made on exotic cherts, it has been postulated that these early
hunters and gatherers were highly mobile or were involved in a wide-area trade network.
The Early Archaic period coincides with the onset of a drying period in North Central
Texas that marks the termination of the Pleistocene period. No isolated Early Archaic

components have been reported in the area, although Early Archaic projectile points are
reported from 22 sites in Prikryl's study area. The vast majority of these sites occur on
terraces.
The Middle Archaic period is likewise poorly known in the area, but environmental data
from Oklahoma suggest that the current climatic conditions had been established between
5000 and 4000 BC. Ferring (in Prikryl 1990:71) suggested that the oak-savannah regime
that is present as the Eastern Cross Timbers between Dallas and Fort Worth started its
development at approximately 4500 BP and displaced grasslands. Middle Archaic sites
are invariably located on the first terrace. It appears to Prikryl (1990:73) that Middle
Archaic sites are more commonly located on terraces adjacent to the Elm Fork than on
tributary terraces.
During the Late Archaic, there appears to have been a significant population increase as
measured by the number of sites, the number of diagnostic projectile points found, and an
apparent expansion of the population into the tributary valleys along the Elm Fork. There
are more than three times as many Late Archaic sites, and more than 65% of these sites
are found on tributaries and not along the Elm Fork. Many of these site collections also
have no earlier dart points, thus it is suggested that what was an acceptable site location
in the Late Archaic had not been utilized earlier. Ferring (1986:116) believes that the
West Fork paleosol dates to the end of this period and further suggests that a wetter
environment in the first millennium AD would have allowed for the expansion of the
Eastern Cross Timbers woodlands. It was during the Late Archaic that there was a
significant increase in the use of local Ogallala quartzite for tool making while non-local
chert was uncommon. As with earlier periods, a hunting and gathering economy
prevailed, and sites are found both in the floodplain and on the first terraces.
The Late Prehistoric I is marked by the presence of pottery and the bow and arrow. Many
factors suggest that Late Archaic lifeways continued even with the appearance of these
new technologies. For example, sites continued to be more common on the tributaries
than along the Elm Fork, and Ogallala quartzite is the primary material for chipped stone
tools. At the same time, there is limited evidence that houses were present at several sites
on the Elm Fork and the East Fork of the Trinity River. The date of the West Fork
paleosol at about 1060±50 BP (Beta-16416) occurred near the end of this period and
marked a shift toward today’s drier climate.
There are many similarities between the Late Prehistoric I and II in North Central Texas.
Along with the modern, drier environment, there is an increase in the number of buffalo
bones, and hence buffalo, in site deposits. In addition, the tool assemblage found at many
Late Prehistoric II sites has a Plains-oriented appearance. Arrow points include Harrell,
Fresno, and Washita. Other tools are snub-nosed scrapers, edge-beveled knives and flake
drills. Nocona Plain pottery and possible horticultural tools are also present. Sites are
typically located on the sandy terraces. Prikryl (1990:80) suggests that this may be due to
the increased flooding that occurred after 950 BP at the end of the West Fork paleosol
stabilization and possibly also because the sandy soils would have been tillable with the
presumed horticultural tools found in some sites.

The Historic Native American period is known primarily from historical documents and
from very little archaeological evidence. Bruseth (1992:87-89) has discussed the Honey
Springs sites, but Skinner (1988) has argued that the physical archaeological evidence
indicates that very little historic Native American archaeology has been documented in
North Central Texas, including Dallas County.
Most historians agree that significant European presence in the area of the Three Forks of
the Trinity River began in 1841, when John Neely Bryan arrived with the intention of
beginning a trading post. He eventually selected a cabin site on a bluff overlooking the
river and near a strategic low-water crossing. The choice of location was considered
important as a historic river crossing already in use by the aboriginal inhabitants and for
its potential site along a navigable waterway connecting the proposed town with the Gulf
coast.
Within a few months, Bryan's location had attracted other settlers, some of whom arrived
under the auspices of Peters Colony grants and established colonies in other areas of
Dallas County. By 1842, there were several settlers to the north who formed the nucleus
of a small settlement which was located along Mustang Creek and later became known as
Farmer's Branch, because these early farmers raised the first crops of wheat, peaches,
hogs, and chickens in the Colony (Rogers 1965:64). The coming of the Houston & Texas
Central railroad in 1872 changed the face and economy of Dallas County. The following
year the Texas & Pacific Railway affected a rail crossroads only one mile from the
original town site and assured a booming future for the young town.
Previous investigations in the surrounding area have consisted of large block surveys and
linear surveys. A large block survey in the Five Mile Creek flood plain (McCormick
1976) found limited evidence of in-situ cultural materials in the flood plain and the only
site nearby was at the junction of Ricketts Branch and Fivemile Creek where animal
bones had been deposited but where no cultural materials were found. Subsequent survey
in this area failed to find any evidence of buried cultural deposits (TASA 2010). The
other large block survey was done during the planning for the South Dallas Campus of
the University of North Texas. No prehistoric sites were recorded in this upland ridge
setting but several historic residential sites were found (Neel, Emery, Sundermeyer, and
Penman 2005). Similar results have occurred in conjunction with linear surveys for roads,
railroad tracks, and pipelines as well as other small tract surveys such as the present one
or the Denley Road Tracts (Skinner 2009). A single isolated end scraper was found at a
dam site on Woody Branch which is a Fivemile Creek tributary to the west but no other
evidence of prehistoric occupation was encountered (Skinner 1996). Very little
prehistoric archaeology has been found outside of the Trinity River flood plain itself and
certainly no significant sites have been found along Fivemile Creek or its tributaries.
Historic sites have tended to be found adjacent to transportation routes and no clearly
significant historic sites warranting further investigation have been recorded.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The study area is situated on a gradual western slope of an upland ridge along which
Lancaster Road was constructed in the 1800s. Crouch Road was essentially a field road
then and continued as such until some time after the Oak Cliff, TX 7.5’ USGS map was
printed and even now it is a narrow single vehicle road in South Dallas. The area was
apparently farmed since early in the 1900s and this continued until the 1970s. The
prehistoric archaeological potential is considered low due to the setting at the edge of the
flood plain of an intermittent second order tributary and the toe slope of the nearby
upland ridge. There are no obvious terrace elevations shown in the survey area and the
flood plain collects rainwater runoff and would have impeded access to water in the
unnamed tributary when it was flowing. No alluvium is mapped in the survey area by the
Bureau of Economic Geology (1972). Historic maps in the late 1800s and 1900s show no
evidence of residences within the survey area or along Crouch Road from Lancaster to
the bridge over the creek. However, there is an interesting “tree-covered” area shown in
the area on the 1980 soil survey aerial photograph (Coffee et al. 1980:Sheet 53). It is in a
setting where a residence could have been located although it is setback from the road
and close to the flood plain in the middle of a farmed area.
Walking 25m spaced transects and shovel testing along each transect provided thorough
coverage and allowed access to the “tree-covered” area as well as encountering any
elevations and eroded areas that might be present. Backhoe trenching was not needed due
to the absence of alluvial sediments but shovel tests needed to penetrate into the B- or
possibly C-horizons. Screening was not done due to the clayey and silty sediments the
matrix was thoroughly inspected. Artifact scatters of fire-cracked rock and lithic debris
and historic artifacts were to have been recorded as sites if found and dated if possible.

RESULTS
The following chapter begins with a review of historic landuse that is derived from
review of a variety of historic maps dated between 1893 and the late 1900s. This is
followed by a description of the archaeological survey and the chapter concludes with a
summary of the results of the investigation.
Historic Landuse
Historic maps of the area provide little information for the period prior to 1900. The 1893
Dallas 30’ USGS map (Figure 3) shows Lancaster Road with the characteristic bend
where Crouch Road intersects to the immediate north.

Figure 3.

The study area location indicated by a red arrow on a portion of the 1893
Dallas 30’ USGS map.

Sam Street’s 1900 map of Dallas County (Figure 4) shows that although a large plot of
land in which the study area sits was owned at the time, Crouch Road had not been
established or was not significant enough to have been included on the map.
Additionally, no structures are mapped in or around the study area, indicating that the
land may not have been farmed before the early 20th century or that it was farmed but that
no residence had been established on or near it.

area location is indicated by a red arrow.

The 1920 Soil Map of Dallas (Figure 5) shows that, by 1920, Crouch Road had been
established and was mapped as an unimproved road in its current location. However,
unlike the layout mapped on the current USGS maps, Crouch road is mapped as a loop
that turns south to intersect with what is today mapped as Simpson Stuart Road. No
structures are present along Crouch Road, but the apparent straightening of Lancaster
Road indicates some degree of improvement in the general area. Also, Miller School is
mapped to the east of the project area just across Lancaster Road. A noteworthy addition
to the area in this time is the Texas Electric railroad line which roughly parallels
Lancaster Road and intersects Crouch Road near where it turns south.

A 1928 Road Map of Dallas County (Figure 6) shows no structures, but maps the Crouch
Road loop as a city road. The 1936 General Highway Map for Dallas County (Figure 7)
indicates the presence of two structures mapped immediately west of the bend in
Lancaster Road, and southeast of the study area. Crouch Road is not mapped on the
Highway Map, and this is indicative of its status as an unimproved road which may have
been maintained by the landowners and not the City. The road may have been rendered
inaccessible by the landowners, as it is not until the 1958 that the road is mapped on the
USGS maps as an unimproved road.

Sheet 53 in the Soil Conservation Service’s (SCS) Soil Survey of Dallas County shows
that the area south of Crouch Road was farmed. However, a portion of land constituting
the study area was a roughly square, 1-acre plot of land that has not been cleared and
appears thoroughly wooded. The reason for this is uncertain, as the area was too small to
have served as a feed lot or a small pasture, and there is no indication of fence lines
marking the wooded area.

Archaeological Investigations
The present condition of the survey area is shown on the aerial photograph that is
included below as Figure 9. A tree-line that marks a fence line that parallels the
northeastern, upslope edge of the property is shown outside the edge of the tract. The
northeastern half of the tract contains several widely spaced cottonwood trees that range
in age from 30-50 years and this entire area has been overgrown by deciduous tree
saplings, poison ivy vines, and young deciduous trees averaging 5-10 years old (Figure
10). The overstory vegetation presents a canopy of individual trees but the understory
vegetation is densely packed. Ground visibility was accordingly poor, between 0 and 30
percent. However, in some areas standing water had eliminated the vegetative ground
cover, resulting in excellent ground visibility of approximately 85 to 100 percent. The
entire area is unfenced and has not been grazed in many years so unfortunately there were
no animal paths crossing through the area. The southwestern half of the tract has a denser
overstory canopy which was primarily along the boundary between the two halves of the
tract (Figure 9). A dense overstory canopy was also present in the northwest corner and
toward the southwest corner. The understory vegetation was similar to that in the
northeastern half of the tract (Figure 11). Standing, and even flowing, groundwater was
present in parts of the southwestern half of the tract. The water was seeping out of the
very saturated soil and certainly no evidence of springs was encountered.
The pedestrian survey was done by members walking parallel northwest-southeast
transects that were spaced at 25 m intervals or closer. The density of the understory
vegetation made this a slow process but if features or structures had been present they
would have been easily visible. Some recent trash had been discarded along the roadway
but all these materials were less than fifty years old. No historic features or artifacts older
than fifty years were exposed on the surface. Additionally, no prehistoric artifacts were
found on the surface.
Shovel testing was done throughout the development tract and evidence of Sunev clay
loam and Lewisville silty clay was found as mapped by the Soil Conservation Service.
Sunev clay loam was encountered in shovel tests (ST) 4-6, 9 and 10 and Lewisville silty
clay was found in the remaining test units. No artifacts were recovered from any units.
The top of the B-horizon in the units of Sunev clay loam was encountered between 35
and 110 cm below the surface (Table 2). A relatively thin plow zone was recognized in
STs 3 and 4. A layer of brownish yellow clay with marble-sized gravels was encountered
in STs 1-3, 8 and 11. This C-horizon soil was apparently brought into the site and spread
out over the surface probably for the purpose of raising the grade above normal flooding.
This soil is overlain by a thin topsoil layer approximately 5 to 12 cm thick, which must
have eroded from upslope. The ground was not saturated in STs 2 through 7, though STs
1 and 8 through 12 were excavated amid standing water. All of the test units became
flooded during excavation, and ST 12 had to be terminated at 45 cm below surface due to
excessive flooding of the test unit.

Conclusions
The archaeological survey of the Magnolia Trace property failed to find any evidence of
historic or prehistoric occupation and this finding agrees with the general evaluation of
the area as having a low potential for prehistoric archaeology as shown on Figure 23 of
the “Dallas Archaeological Potential” report. The toe slope setting is one in which
alluvial sediments would not have been deposited but where upslope sediments were
likely to have been deposited in the historic period by erosion of farmed prairie soils.
However, very little evidence of this was found and the history of farming over the past
century is likely to have disturbed and exposed artifacts that had been deposited on the
essentially stable upland slope setting in the prehistoric past. In fact, it is likely that the
washing away of farmed upland sediments would have deflated artifacts onto the present
ground surface and this was not found to have been the case. Furthermore, this setting did
not provide any protection from water running off the slope and at least temporarily

ponding in the adjacent flood plain so it would not have been selected for even a
temporary camp site.
The absence of historic trash or residences is attributed to the use of the land as farmland
and the distance to Lancaster Road which is the major thoroughfare adjacent to the study
area. For most of the twentieth century, Crouch Road was a minor unimproved road in a
rural part of the city which probably was an unpaved, clay-based road until sometime in
the 1960s or more recently. The upland slope across which the road is drawn would have
been virtually worthless for access from upslope on Lancaster Road during wet seasons
of the year. Thus, the absence of historic structures and trash discard locations is
understandable.
In a wider sense, it became apparent that a more favorable site for prehistoric habitation
was located just west of the study area along the east bank of the unnamed tributary. A
ridge that is shown on Figure 1 extends from the upland to the east down to the edge of
the creek and is well above flooding and yet would have provided east access to the
riparian resources along the creek and into the upland for hunting big game. Although it
is reasonable to expect that water was not available year-round, this setting could have
been occupied on a seasonal basis when water was in the creek. At these same times of
the year, water was likely to be sheeting off the upland and washing across parts of the
study area, thus making them undesirable camping locations. From a broader perspective,
prehistoric occupation along Fivemile Creek seems to have been very restricted and to
have been found primarily only in the areas of within the Trinity River flood plain and
not in the uplands or along the intermittent tributaries. Based on current and past findings,
it is to be expected that no evidence of prehistoric occupation would have been found at
the Magnolia Trace property.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the negative results of the records review and the pedestrian survey of the
Magnolia Trace property in South Dallas, AR Consultants concludes that no significant
cultural resources will be impacted by the proposed development. It is our
recommendation that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted. If cultural
resources are uncovered during construction, work should immediately cease in that area
and the Texas Historical Commission be notified.
