ROCK ART OF THE GUADALUPE MOUNTAINS
NATIONAL PARK AREA
JOHN W. CLARK, JR.

ABSTRACT
Rock art in the Guadalupe Mountains National Park and in the adjacent
Delaware Mountains consists of petroglyphs and paintings on stone surfaces, usually located in the interiors of rock shelters or slight overhangs.
The paintings apparently fall within the Jornada Style as defined by
Schaafsma (1972:101-118) and are dated between A.D~ 1050 and 1400 on
the basis of ceramic association.

INTRODUCTION
Six rock art sites in the Guadalupe Mountain National Park area are
described; four are located within the park boundaries and two are in
the nearby Delaware Mountains. The rock art was copied during the
Texas Archeological Society’s annual field school held in the
Guadalupe Mountains during June of 1970. The field school was
conducted to instruct the Texas Archeological Society members in
the "... purposes and techniques of modern archeological surveysl
and to carry out a systematic problem-oriented site survey of a portion
of the park" (Sharer 1970:10).
The purpose of the rock art survey was similar. Primarily, the
objectives were to introduce the field school participants to the techniques of recording rock art. Several recording techniques were
utilized in documenting the rock art in order to maximize the accuracy of the final product. Ultimately, the objective is to integrate the
rock art studies into a general understanding of the local prehistoric
cultural systems.
RECORDING TECHNIQUES
The method of pictograph recording most frequently used by the
survey party was a technique described by Dewdney and Kidd (1962)
and Clark (1967). This technique involves the use of water, Japanese
rice paper and soft pastels to make direct full size color tracings of the
paintings. First, the wall of the shelter must be wet carefully with the
water; then, the rice paper is placed over the painting (Fig. 1,a). The
paper is then wet to make it nearly transparent, allowing the tracing of
the pictograph to be made. The advantages of this method are that one
obtains a full size tracing in the natural or near the natural color, the
paper is opaque when dry, and wall conditions and configuration
may be indicated on the paper. Unfortunately, the paper is not per-

fectly transparent when wet and one must be sure not to overlook faint
portions of a painting.
A second technique employed was direct full size tracing utilizing
sheets of clear acetate and ink marking pens. Again, the advantage is
an accurate full size tracing of a painting, but one cannot approach the
natural color, show lighter or darker areas or satisfactorily note wall
features. This technique has been used previously in Texas by
Gebhard (1960), Grieder (1965) and Brook and Green (1967).
Scale drawings using colored pencils or water colors were another
means used in copying rock art. Bartlett (1854) was among the first to
use this technique in recording Texas rock art. The scale drawing
approach was also used by Jackson (1938) and Kirkland (1938, 1939
and 1942). The most recent work utilizing this approach has been
done by Green (1967a, 1967b), Brook and Green (1967), Green (1966,
1969) and Walters (1968). In all of these instances the primary recording device was the scale sketch.
Another technique utilized by the field school was recording by
color and black and white photography. The primary advantage of
this method is that one achieves a copy characterized by minimal
interpretation by the recorder, assuming the shelter wall is flat and the
camera is oriented perpendicularly to the plane of the wall. However,
there are often distortions of proportion due to the irregularities of the
rock surface and differences in camera angle. Because of the distortions involved, which can sometimes be quite serious, this method is
unsatisfactory for final recording.
Petroglyphs were noted at only one site in the park. These were
recorded by rubbing a pencil on a piece of paper which had been
placed over the engraved lines. Photographs were also taken of the
petroglyphs.
In addition to copies of the rock art, field records include written
site descriptions, photo record sheets, a catalog of artifacts collected
at each site, site maps, a description of the geology and environment
and grid plans for the pictograph copies. Each site was plotted on a
U.S. Geological Survey topographic map of the area.

THE SITES

In this section of the report the sites are described with data on the
geology, topographic position, painting surface, pictograph location
at the sites and a brief description of the pictographs.. The figures
include maps of the sites and the pictograph copies oriented in relation to a grid superimposed on the wall of each shelter.

Smith Cave (41CU15)
Smith Cave, previously recorded as pictograph site 17 by Jackson
(1938:57), is located in the north wall of Smith Canyon, an east-west
trending canyon on the east side of the Guadalupe Mountains massif.
It is near the head of the canyon and consists of two open chambers,
each containing red monochrome pictographs (Fig. 2, 3). The shelter
is located at an elevation of approximately 6,500 feet above mean sea
level and is a solution cavity formed near the base of a massive
formation of light gray, very finely crystalline, fossiliferous limestone. Vertical fractures extend the entire width of the formation,
allowing water to percolate through the fractures to wash the dark
gray weathered surface to a light gray or almost white color. The stone
has many small solution cavities filled with coarsely crystalline calcite. The exposed surfaces are characterized by numerous solution
cavities, ripple marks and fossil molds. This massive limestone formation forms a cap over more thinly bedded strata of limestone. A
perennial spring flows in the canyon below the shelter.
The ceiling of the north chamber is smoke blackened, and both
chambers contain midden deposits and dust exfoliated from the walls
and ceiling of the shelter. Pictographs, all done in red paint, are
located on the north end of the southwest facing wall of the north
chamber and on the west and north facing walls of the south chamber.
Archeological materials collected on the surface of the midden are not
diagnostic and do not help date the site.
The pictographs in the north chamber are confined to grid squares
3, 5 and 7 or an area about eight feet in length and four feet in height
(Fig. 3). They consist of a group of "n"-like figures and a ladder-like
design oriented horizontally.
In the south chamber is a more extensive panel of motifs consisting
of horizontally oriented ladder-like designs, curvilinear arrangements of dots, a hand print and several fragmentary designs.
Paintings at this site resemble the Desert Abstract Style described
by Schaafsma (1972:63). Other sites on the east side of the Guadalupe
Mountains massif in New Mexico contain similar motifs. These sites
include Last Chance Canyon and Painted Grotto. The principal difference between Smith Cave and the New Mexico sites is that the Smith
Cave pictographs are monochrome while the others are polychrome.
Schaafsma (1972:63) presumes this style to be earlier than the Jornada
Style characterizing the pictograph sites described below.
Apache Mask Cave (41CU24)
Apache Mask Cave is located in the north wall of an unnamed
east-west trending canyon on the east side of the massif. Like Smith

Cave, it is near the head of the canyon and near the upper limits of the
massive limestone deposit referred to in the discussion of Smith Cave.
The canyon is capped by a resistant massive limestone underlaid by
more thinly bedded limestone covered with small loose talus derived
from the decomposition of the upper beds. These strata dip to the
southeast.
The shelter (Fig. 1,b) is a southward facing solution cavity approximately fifty feet in length and about thirty feet deep. Along the back
wall are three small alcoves containing paintings (Fig. 4). The floor of
the shelter is composed of thinly bedded southerly dipping beds of
limestone. No cultural refuse deposit was present on the shelter floor.
The westernmost alcove contains a small group of curvilinear and
circular motifs (Fig. 5, grid 3). The middle alcove contains a slightly
more extensive group including concentric circles, several curvilinear motifs, a possible human figure, a mask-like element and a
circle enclosing two smaller circles which are separated by a diagonal
line (Fig. 5, grids 13-17). In the easternmost alcove are numerous
incomplete motifs, mainly straight lines oriented vertically or
diagonally (Fig. 5, grids 34-40). Too few motifs occur to allow detailed
analysis; for the present, they are merely recorded. The motifs, however, are characteristic of Schaafsma’s (1972:102) eastern phase of the
Jornada Style.
41 CU48
The third rock art site located on the east side of the massif is
41CU48 (Fig. 6). It is in the north wall of an east-west trending canyon
locally known as Bear Canyon; the site is near the base of the same
massive limestone outcrop in which the other east side pictograph
sites are found. This southeastward dipping formation contains
numerous rockshelters. The geological formations and topographic
conditions are similar to those at the other sites on the east side of the
massif. 41CU48 is located near the head of the canyon.
Pictographs at the site are confined to the two ends of the shelter.
The paintings consist of a group of four vertical yellow lines on the
west end of the shelter and two yellow crosses and a circle with rays
on the east end (Fig. 6).
41CU70
The fourth pictograph site within the park is located on the west
wall of a north-south trending canyon on the southwest side of the
massif. Paintings occur near the mouth of the canyon in proximity to a
substantial midden deposit and bedrock mortar holes (Fig. 7). It is at
an elevation of about 4,500 feet above mean sea level. The gravelly bed

of an arroyo is surrounded by slopes of thinly bedded black limestone
on the lower portions of the canyon and lighter colored limestone in
the middle and upper portions of the canyon. The limestone is finely
crystalline and contains black chert seams and nodules. Quarrying
activities of the site inhabitants are evident at several localities
around the site. Water erosion and scouring of the limestone floor of
the canyon produced several tinajas (potholes) which retain runoff
water for short periods.
The site consists of a midden (containing Pecos Brown andJornada
Brown sherds) overlying a talus bench at the west side of the mouth of
the canyon. The vertical face of the west wall of the canyon bears
pictographs and petroglyphs. Fifteen bedrock mortar holes occur in
the canyon floor northwest of the midden.
Petroglyphs appear as very finely engraved lines high on the west
side of the canyon where the midden rises to meet the vertical face.
They consist of converging diagonal, vertical, cross-hatched and
horizontal lines in five small groups (Fig. 8). Pictographs appear in
three groups on the vertical face north of the midden. Group one (Fig.
9) consists of a series of polychrome paintings in a niche formed in a
joint plane high on the face. They consist of red and black curvilinear
and representational motifs overlying, in part, a patch of yellow paint.
Group two motifs (Fig. 9) are adjacent to group one outside the niche.
They consist of three vertical red lines, two with vertically oriented
zigzag lines and one with diagonal red lines. The third group (Fig. 9)
lies near the base of the vertical face, low in the canyon. This group
consists of a group of at least fourteen deer, several perforated by
fletched projectiles; a human figure; a pair of horizontally oriented
zigzag lines; and a motif consisting of a central dot with four triangles
forming an open "X." Paintings in group three are badly faded by
exposure to rain and sun. A fourth group is thought by some members
of the crew to exist between groups two and three, but they may be
manganese stains washed down the vertical face.

SITES OUTSIDE THE PARK
Two pictograph sites related stylistically to 41CU40 and the other
sites of the Jornada Style were discovered outside the park. They are
on the northwest side of the Delaware Mountains massif.
Bear Cave (41CU14)
At Bear Cave, paintings occur in red and yellow and all are associated with pecked petroglyphs. The site consists of a very slight
overhanging face above a low shallow shelter. A narrow ledge lies at

the mouth of the shelter. Petroglyphs, all "projectile point" motifs, are
found on the upper portion of the ledge, while polychrome paintings
are found on the lower portion (Fig. 10). These paintings conform to
the Jornada Style, eastern phase. The projectile point motifs are not
unknown in Western United States rock art and have been used, in
some instances, as an aid in dating petroglyphs through the identification of projectile point types (Thomas and Thomas 1972; Heizer and
Baumhoff 1962). Archeological remains found at the site consist of a
single sherd of E1 Paso Brown pottery and an arrow point.
41CU13
Site 41CU13 is a westward facing shelter in a soft fine-grained
sandstone. A midden deposit is present in the shelter and considerable quantities of burned rock, ash and artifacts are found on the talus
slope in front of the shelter. A ledge containing 11 bedrock mortar
holes runs along the rear wall. Lying on the ledge are two large roof
spalls which are polished and exhibit numerous petroglyphs, similar
to those at 41CU14; a stone lined cist is present in the floor of the
shelter. The paintings are located along the rear wall of the shelter and
cluster in four groups; only the most southerly group is illustrated
(Fig. 11). The paintings are red, black or yellow monochrome motifs,
some appearing on smoke blackened roof remnants, thus apparently
being older than those on the more recently exfoliated areas. Archeological materials from the site include Chupadero Black on
White, E1 Paso Polychrome, E1 Paso Brown, Jornada Brown andPecos
Brown potsherds. These artifacts are comparable to those found at
41CU70.
Clearly, the deer at 41CU13 and 41CU70 are similar in form and
style, if not color, while the human figures at 41CU14 and 41CU70 are
similar in style. Likewise, the petroglyphs at 41CU13 and 41CU14 are
similar. Many of the same sherds appear at these three sites; thus, the
sites appear to be related both stylistically and chronologically.

DISCUSSION
The paintings on the east side of the Guadalupe Mountains massif
appear to be more formalized or abstract than those at 41CU70,
41CU13 or 41CU14. Furthermore, the paintings at 41CU15 may date
to an earlier period than those at the other sites. Archeological materials collected at 41CU15 are not temporally diagnostic, and no materials were found at either 41CU24 or 41CU48.
Some of the paintings at 41CU15 were reported by Jackson
(1938:57-59). Unfortunately there are numerous discrepancies between the paintings, his copies and photographs (Jackson 1938: Plate

XLI.3, p.56 and Fig. 42.1, p.58). He illustrates several petroglyph sites
in the area (Sites 13, 18, 20 and 172) which are clearly different from
the petroglyphs at 41CU13, 41CU14 and 41CU70, but one of his sites
(Site 20) does have three "projectile point" motifs (Jackson 1938:54,
Fig. 35) and engraved converging and crosshatched lines (Jackson
1938:67, Plate L). Other paintings are recorded at Jackson’s sites 21
and 178. Those recorded at Site 178 (Jackson 1938:74-78, Plates LVLIX) are very similar to those at 41CU70. The paintings depict deer
perforated by fletched projectiles and human figures. Jackson’s Site
178 is approximately 45 miles south of 41CU70 in the Baylor Mountains. Mera (1938) illustrates paintings from the Guadalupes in New
Mexico which tend to substantiate the conclusions that the paintings
conform to Schaafsma’s (1972:101-118) Jornada Style, while those at
41CU15 appear to be of an earlier style (Schaafsma 1972:61-71). Petroglyphs similar to those at 41CU13 and 41CU14 are found in Hudspeth County at Jackson’s Site 11 (Jackson 1938:35-38). In general, the
style of the Guadalupe Mountains pictographs is similar to the paintings recorded by Jackson in E1 Paso, Hudspeth and Culberson Counties, Texas and Otero County, New Mexico. Specifically, some of the
mask designs at his Site 2 (Jackson 1938:17) and animal motifs (deer)
at his Sites 27 and 29 in Jeff Davis County (Jackson 1938:91) are
similar to those at 41CU70, while some ladder-like motifs at his Sites
26 and 27 (Jackson 1938:91) are similar to those at 41CU15.
Kirkland recorded pictographs between Mount Livermore in Jeff
Davis County and Balmorhea in Reeves County that contain deer
motifs similar to those at 41CU70 (Kirkland and Newcomb
1967:132-138, Plates 88-91). More variable motifs occur in that area
than at 41CU13, 41CU14 and 41CU70. Balmorhea Shelter (Kirkland
and Newcomb 1967:138, Plate 93.3) contains motifs similar to those at
41CU15. Masks and animal motifs at Hueco Tanks in E1 Paso County
(Kirkland 1938, 1939; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:173-203; Newcomb 1963:118; Crimmins 1931; and Mungo 1970) are certainly
stylistically related to the paintings in the Guadalupe Mountains
National Park (except for 41CU15). They are also stylistically similar
to those reported in Eddy County, New Mexico (Green 1967a), White
Rock Cave in E1 Paso County (Green 1967b: Fig. 10; Brook and Green
1967) and Atlatl Pictograph Site in the Sierra de Kilo, Chihuahua
(Green 1966: Figs. 6 and 7).
The paintings in the Guadalupe Mountains National Park conform
to the southeastern New Mexico styles of Turner (1963:33-38) and
more specifically to the eastern phase of the Jornada Style defined by
Schaafsma (1972). This style consists of representational and abstract
motifs of stylized animals, naturalistic and formalized human forms

GUADALUPE ROCK ART

115

and complex decorative patterns. The eastern division of this style is
characterized by the presence of many masks, formalized rectilinear
human figures and often by the use of natural rock projections as
noses in masks (Schaafsma 1972:114). The Guadalupe Mountains
paintings are apparently within the broad tradition of southwestern
art as typified by the paintings in Navajo Reservoir, New Mexico
(Schaafsma 1963, 1965).
Adjacent areas of western Texas are also characterized by numerous
paintings and petroglyphs. In the middle portion of the Pecos River
valley of Texas there are paintings that appear to be similar to the
paintings of 41CU15, 24 and 48, the paintings on the east side of the
mountain massif. They are mostly curvilinear and nonrepresentational. Examples are at 41TE4 and 41TE5 (Clark 1967).
Other sites in that area such as 41CX2 (Clark 1967) in Crockett County,
sites in eastern Pecos County (Walters 1968) and Meyer’s Spring in
central Terrell County (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:112-123; Jackson 1938:p.146, Plates XCIX-CXII) do not specifically resemble any
paintings in the Park, but are primarily representational like those on
the west side of the Guadalupe Mountain massif.
Rock art on the Llano Estacado (Riggs 1966) in Garza County and
farther north in the panhandle of Texas (Jackson 1938; Kirkland 1942;
Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:203-216) is stylistically different from
the art of the Guadalupes, as is that of central Texas (Kirkland and
Newcomb 1967:143-172). A considerable amount of work has been
done on the rock art of the Lower Pecos River valley (Jackson
1938:165-238; Kirkland 1937, 1938 and 1939; Newcomb 1963; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:37-110; Gebhard 1960; Grieder 1965). Again
there is little stylistic similarity between the rock art styles of the
lower Pecos and those of the eastern Mogollon area as exemplified by
the art of the Guadalupe Mountains.
Interpretation of pictographs and other art forms requires an extensive knowledge of the ethnography of either the artists themselves or
their recent descendents (Boas 1955). Without knowledge of the
iconography involved in a style or a literal representative execution,
the interpretation of meaning is difficult, if not impossible (Clark
1967). Interpretation may depend on the intent(s) of the paintings.
They may have functioned as mnemonic devices (Mountford 1964:15;
Birkett-Smith 1963:32), as magical elements in hunting or other
ceremonies, as a record of an historical event, as a means of religious
devotion or as a casual scrawl.
The paintings of 41CU13, 41CU14 and 41CU70 are representative
and may be interpreted in several ways. The motifs at 41CU70 seem to
be primarily associated with hunting. Likewise, hunting motifs at

116

TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL SOCIETY

41CU13 and 41CU14 are prominent, but more human motifs and
ritual masks occur. These sites are associated with extensive midden
deposits.
The paintings on the east side of the massif are much more difficult
to discuss and interpret because of their non-representational nature.
Smith Cave is associated with a midden deposit, while 41CU24 and
41CU48 are located in canyons in which no other archeological remains were found. These localities may be ritualistic shrines. Similar
sites seem to be present in northeastern Terrell County (Clark 1967).
Their meaning is unclear at present because of the limited sample size
and non-representational nature of the rock art.

CONCLUSIONS
Two distinctive stylistic traditions of prehistoric rock art in the
Guadalupe Mountains National Park area have been described. One
tradition, present at sites 41CU13, 41CU14, 41CU24, 41CU48 and
41CU70, is a representational style associated with a general Southwestern tradition and particularly with the Jornada Branch of the
Mogollon (Lehmer 1948); the other style present at 41CU15 is principally abstract or non-representational, possibly predating the Jornada
Style. Sites of the Jornada style consist of a wide range of motifs.
Those on the east side of the Guadalupe Mountains massif consist of
the least representational elements of the style and are not associated
with archeological deposits. The styles on the west side of the massif
and those in the Delaware Mountains consist of representational
motifs and are associated with extensive midden deposits. The Jornada style paintings on the east side of the massif may have been
ritualistic sites.
The only recognized archeological complex in the area associated
with the southwest is the Jornada Branch of the Mogollon (Lehmer
1948). The paintings may have been executed by some other group
closely associated with the Mogollon or by Mogollon peripheral
units, ut there is a sufficient number of known sites with Southwestern style paintings to indicate that their influence was widespread in
Texas.
Thus, all the rock art sites recorded in this report, with the exception of 41CU15, are of the Jornada Style. The sites are clearly important to the understanding of the nonmaterial aspects of the cultures
which produced them. They should be protected from vandals in
order that they, with other sites still to be found and recorded, may
enhance our understanding of the people who occupied the southern
portion of the Guadalupe Mountains.
