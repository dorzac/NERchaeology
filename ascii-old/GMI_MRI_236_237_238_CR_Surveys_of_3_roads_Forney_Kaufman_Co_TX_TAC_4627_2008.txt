ABSTRACT

The project consists of reconnaissance survey of existing right-of-way (ROW) along FM 548
from the US 80 interchange to the intersection of FM 1641 in Forney, Kaufman County, Texas.
The project area is approximately 0.3-miles long and the ROW is 360 feet wide; comprising the
full Area of Potential Effects (APE). The entire ROW consists of 21.8 acres of state-owned
property. The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this project area is to conduct an
inventory or determine potential for and the presence/absence of archeological resources and to
evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas. This work
is being conducted under contract to Civil Associates, Inc., with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI project
number 30561.00.04), as a subcontractor. Fieldwork for the reconnaissance survey was
undertaken in August 2007, by Geo-Marine, Inc.
Large portions of the proposed project area were heavily disturbed by previous road construction
and utility infrastructure installation. No cultural deposits were identified during the current
survey and the potential for finding intact deposits is considered extremely low. As a result of
these investigations, it is recommended that the proposed alterations of FM 548 and the
interchange at US 80 will have no effect on archeological historic properties and that no further
work is required. Notes, forms, files, photographs, and other materials from this project will be
permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

INTRODUCTION

The project consists of reconnaissance survey of existing right-of-way (ROW) along FM 548
from the US 80 interchange to the intersection of FM 1641 in Forney, Kaufman County, Texas.
The project area is approximately 0.3-miles long and the ROW is 360 feet wide, consisting of
21.8 acres of state-owned property. The existing ROW makes up the area of potential effect
(APE). The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this project area is to conduct an
inventory or determine the potential for and the presence/absence of archeological resources, and
to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended,
or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas. This
work is being conducted under contract to Civil Associates, Inc., with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI
project number 30561.00.04), as a subcontractor. Fieldwork for the reconnaissance survey was
undertaken on August 13, 2007, by Kristen J. Bastis, Project Archeologist, of Geo-Marine, Inc.
(GMI). Melissa M. Green, also of GMI, served as Principal Investigator for the project.
The APE comprises the current ROW and extends along FM 548 from the US 80 interchange to
the intersection of FM 1641 in Kaufman County (Figures 1 and 2). The APE is approximately
0.3-miles long and the ROW is 360 feet wide and consists of 21.8 acres of state owned property
(Figures 1 and 2). It is not anticipated that any additional ROW is needed; however there may be
corner clips from property that the Texas Department of Transportation already owns. The
project consists of reconstructing the US 80 interchange at FM 548 to allow for more horizontal
and vertical clearance under the bridge over FM 548. Improvements will continue south, crossing
the railroad, to the FM 1641 intersection. The interchange construction will remain at grade and
the vertical impact will be between three and five feet in depth.
The entire APE is in an upland environment with a small intermittent drainage, a tributary of
Mustang Creek, crossing to the north and west of the APE. Large portions of the APE were
heavily disturbed by previous road construction and utility infrastructure installation in the APE.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Kaufman County is within the Texan biotic province defined by Blair (1950) as an intermediate
zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the grasslands of the
Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits of their range in
the Texan province. The vegetation within the project area is predominantly grassland with
scattered clusters of trees, with the greatest concentration of trees being found along the
drainages. Grasses expected to occur within this area include: little bluestem, big bluestem,
Indiangrass, hairgrama switchgrass, Florida paspalum, eastern gramagrass, sideoats grama, Texas
needlegrass, Virginia wildrye, Torrey silver bluestem, meadow dropseed, vine-mesquite, and
buffalograss (Coffee et al. 1980:88-90). The faunal community in this region has undergone
changes due to the expansion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. However, the species of
wildlife, which previously inhabited the area, include bobwhite, quail, pheasant, meadowlark,
field sparrow, sage grouse, lark bunting, cottontail, red fox, antelope, and deer (Coffee et al.
1980:50).
The region has a warm, temperate, humid subtropical climate that is generally mild, with periods
of extremely hot and cold weather being limited in duration. Yearly rainfall is fairly evenly
distributed, with the maximum rainfall occurring in April and May and the minimum in August.
Much of the rainfall occurs in heavy thunderstorms, with the rapid runoff allowing only limited
absorption of water by the soil. Snowfall is rare, with an average of less than 2.8 cm (1 in) falling
per year. The snowfall is generally present for less than one week. The prevailing winds vary
from south to southeast throughout the year, although northerly winds are frequent during the
winter months (Pringle 1977).
The proposed project area along FM 740 is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous-age Neylandville
Formation and Marlbrook Marl. The Neylandville Formation is clay, calcareous silty sandy
medium gray; weathers light gray and forms irregular topography. Marlbrook Marl is clay
calcareous variable amount of silt and glauconite, disseminated pyrite, phosphate nodules, and
phosphatized marine megafossils, blocky concodial fracture, light to dark gray, weathers light
gray with poor fissility, marine mega fossils (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988).

4

The proposed project area consists of two soil map units: Houston Black series soils are deep,
calcareous soils found on nearly level to moderately sloping uplands or old alluvial terraces. The
Houston Black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is about 178 cm (70 in) thick. It has a very dark gray
clay A horizon about 112 cm (44 in) thick, with the upper 15 cm (6 in) being a plow zone. Below
this is the AC horizon, consisting of a light gray clay 112-152 cm (44-60 in) deep. Finally, there
is a light gray clay C horizon from 152 to over 178 cm (60-70+ in) deep. The Houston Black
clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes, has a similar but thicker profile, with the A horizon being 140 cm
(55 in) thick and the AC horizon 76 cm (30 in) thick (Pringle 1977).

CULTURAL SETTING

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the Texas Historical Commissionâs Texas Archeological Sites Atlas indicated no
previously recorded sites were mapped within a 1-km radius of the project area. One survey was
conducted within the 1-km study radius of the current APE. The survey was conducted by
Blanton and Associates in October of 2006 on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation.
The survey began approximately 0.1 miles south of the intersection of FM 1641 and FM 688
along the entire length of FM 1641, approximately 5 miles (Young 2007). No sites were
identified during the survey.

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
Although the chronological framework for the Upper Trinity River Basin is not well developed,
the available data allow the delineation of a generalized chronology (Table 1). For an in depth
discussion of the culture history of the area and a discussion of the time periods see Bruseth and
Martin 1987, Cliff et al. 1996, Crook and Harris 1952, 1954, 1957, 1958, 1961, Green et al. 1997,

Baird 1985, Skinner et al. 1982, Story 1990, and Yates and Ferring 1986.

HISTORIC OCCUPATION/UTILIZATION
The first Kaufman County settlement was started in 1840 by William P. King and a group of forty
pioneers from Holly Springs, Mississippi. The group built a fort and named it Kingâs Fort after
their leader. On July 27, 1846, King patented the survey that included Kingâs Fort to the new
state government which has recently been annexed into the United States. At that time, the
territory was part of the newly created Henderson County, and was drawn from it and established
as a separate county in February 1848. It was named for David Spangler Kaufman, a diplomat
and member of the Congress of the Republic of Texas, the legislature of the state of Texas, and
the Congress of the United States (Handbook of Texas 2006).

In 1861, Kaufman County's citizens voted in favor of the state's secession from the Union and
during the four years of the Civil War, the county contributed several companies of soldiers, most
of whom fought in Elkanah B. Greer's regiment. From 1880 to 1930 Kaufman County retained
its antebellum rural and agricultural character. The Texas and Pacific Railway was completed
through the northern part of the county in 1873, linking Kaufman with Longview to the east and
Dallas-Fort Worth to the west. During the mid-1890s, the Texas-Midland Railroad was
completed through Kaufman County to Garret in the south and Paris in the north (Handbook of
Texas 2006).
The 1930s and 1940s witnessed significant changes in Kaufman County as the Great Depression
and World War II affected its people. The Second World War ended the economic crisis but also
brought a sizable emigration from the county. As the population of Kaufman County and its
agricultural production declined, there were other, more positive, developments. The county was
soon served by U.S. highways 80 and 175, State highways 34 and 243, and Interstate Highway
20. Beginning in 1938, the Kaufman County Electric Cooperative made electricity widely
available to county residents and advancement in the educational level of the county's population
occurred after 1940 (Handbook of Texas 2006).
Development along Interstate 20 and the eastward spread of Dallas pointed toward further
commercial development and continued educational advancement in the county. The economy
depended on agribusiness, varied manufacturing, and retail sales; the northwestern part of the
county, including the project area, was increasingly tied into the growth of the city of Dallas
(Handbook of Texas 2006).
The city of Forney, in the northwestern corner of Kaufman County, has undergone a series of
transformations since the settlement of what was âBrooklynâ in 1871. According to the THC
âForneyâ site form, a Native American trail, or Kickapoo Trace, ran through the area prior to
Euro-American settlement. In the 1840s, Isaac Briscoe and Jacob Sheltman and their families
settled in what became the village of Brooklyn. The Texas & Pacific Railroad extended its line
through Brooklyn in 1873. The same year a post office was established and the town was
renamed Forney after noted Texas & Pacific Railroad official John W. Forney. By the 1890s,
Forney had established more than 50 businesses, including a bank, an opera house, and two
hotels. Railroad transport, agriculture, and timber comprised its primary economic base.
âBlackland Prairieâ hay, ranching, cotton, and other agricultural activity have provided a sound
economic base for Forney for more than 100 years. The railway continued to be a strong force in
Forney into the twentieth century. In the 1920s, Forney expanded on its transportation
7

development with the establishment of the Dixie Highway (US 80) and an interurban railroad.
The town suffered an economic setback during the Great Depression, but has undergone a revival
as a quaint, rural, antique shopping destination (Ellis 2007).

METHODS

The Texas Site Atlas (nueces.thc.state.tx.us) was consulted prior to beginning field work. One
survey was conducted within a 1-km radius of the APE. A 5-mile archeological survey along FM
1641 for the Texas Department of Transportation by Blanton and Associates was conducted in
2006. No sites were recorded during the survey and no previously recorded sites are mapped
within a 1-km radius of the APE. The Texas Historic Map Overlay was examined and two
relevant maps were located; the 1963 USGS Forney South Topographic Quadrangle and the
United States Army Corps of Engineers 1936 Kaufman County Soils Map.
The project area was surveyed traveling south along FM 548 from US 80 to the intersection with
FM 1641 using reconnaissance survey. The survey began by driving the length of the APE to
assess the condition of the existing ROW. There is one drainage, a small tributary of Mustang
Creek, crossing to the north and east of the APE; the course of which has been altered to flow
under US 80 and the adjacent railroad. The condition of the APE was documented with digital
photographs. There were no drainage banks to survey since the drainage was outside the APE.
Since this is a reconnaissance survey, shovel testing was not conducted. This was due to the
amount and type of disturbance expected in the existing ROW and current APE. All notes,
forms, and photographs will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

RESULTS

No historic structures were depicted on either the 1963 USGS Forney South Topographic
Quadrangle or the United States Army Corps of Engineers 1936 Kaufman County Soils Map in or
adjacent to the current APE.
The entire APE is situated in an upland environment. The area north of US 80 is developed with
fast food restaurants and retail businesses. US 80 traverses a bridge over FM 548 and the
roadway is built up on berms on either side of the bridge. The area around the interchange is
otherwise nearly level, undeveloped land except for the built up roadbed of US 80 and the
vegetation is mown grass and weeds. Starting at the north end, the APE begins at the intersection
of US 80 and FM 548. The APE then heads south, along FM 548, across railroad tracks, to the
intersection of 1641 (Figures 3-7). The area between US 80 and Broad Street, the south frontage
road, to the east of FM 548 is covered in piles of gravel. Culverts have been installed to facilitate
drainage of surface water, buried cable markers were observed along the west side of FM 548,
and aerial lines are visible throughout the project area. A drainage flows southwest, crossing FM
548 just north of the APE and under US 80 and the railroad just west of the APE.
No cultural materials were found during the current survey on the surface of the existing ROW.
Several piles of construction gravel were observed south of US 80 and east of FM 548. Modern
trash was occasionally observed in the APE and is most likely the result of road side littering.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The project consists of reconnaissance survey of existing ROW along FM 548 from US 80 to FM
1641. The APE is approximately 0.3 miles long and the ROW is 360 ft wide, all state-owned
property. The APE falls completely in an upland environment and the mapped soils are Houston
Black upland soils (Pringle 1977). The purpose of the cultural resources investigation is to
determine the potential for and the presence/absence of archeological resources, and to evaluate
identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places as
per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation
as a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas.

Due to the upland setting of the project area, the recent development and construction in the APE,
it is unlikely that the area would contain any subsurface archeological deposits with contextual
integrity. The reconnaissance survey of the existing 360-ft ROW found that large sections of the
APE have been adversely affected by previous road construction, rail road construction, and
utility infrastructure installation. No cultural materials were found during the survey on the
surface.
No historic properties were identified during the current survey. As a result of these
investigations, it is recommended that the proposed reconstructing the US 80 interchange at FM
548 and improvements continuing south, to the FM 1641 intersection will not effect archeological
historic properties and that no further work is required.

ABSTRACT

The project consists of reconnaissance survey of existing right-of-way (ROW) along FM 740
from US 80 to Ridgecrest Road in Kaufman County, Texas. The project area is 0.9-miles long
and the right-of-way is 60 ft in width, consisting of 6.5 acres of state-owned property. It is not
anticipated that additional ROW will be required. The area of potential effect (APE) is confined
to the current ROW. The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this project area is to
determine the potential for and the presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate
identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places as
per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation
as a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas. This work is being
conducted under contract to Civil Associates, with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI project number
30561.00.04) as a subcontractor. Fieldwork for the reconnaissance survey was undertaken on
August 13, 2007, by Geo-Marine, Inc.
Large portions of the proposed project area were heavily disturbed by previous road construction
and utility infrastructure placement. No cultural deposits were identified during the current
survey and the potential for finding intact deposits is considered extremely low. As a result of
these investigations, it is recommended that the proposed widening of FM 740 will have no effect
on archeological historic properties and that no further work is required. Notes, forms, files,

INTRODUCTION

The project consists of reconnaissance survey of existing right-of-way (ROW) along FM 740
from US 80 to Ridgecrest Road, in Forney, Kaufman County, Texas. The project area is 0.9miles long and the ROW is 60 ft in width. The project area consists of 6.5 acres of state owned
property. It is not anticipated that additional ROW will be required; therefore the area of
potential effect (APE) is the current ROW. The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in
this project area is to determine the potential for and the presence/absence of archeological
resources, and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,
as amended, or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of
Texas. This work is being conducted under contract to Civil Associates, Inc., with Geo-Marine,
Inc. (GMI project number 30561.00.04), as a subcontractor.
The reconnaissance survey was undertaken in August, 2007 by Kristen J. Bastis, Project
Archeologist, of GMI. Melissa M. Green, also of GMI, served as Principal Investigator for the
project.
The APE extends along FM 740 from US 80 northeast to Ridgecrest Road (Figures 1 and 2). The
APE consists of 60 ft of existing state-owned ROW. The project will consist of widening the
existing rural two-lane undivided roadway to a four-lane divided urban facility. The length of the
new four-lane roadway will be 0.9 miles from US 80 northeast to Ridegcrest Road. The highway
will remain at grade and the vertical impact will be no greater than three to five feet below the
current ground surface.
The entire APE is in an upland environment with one very small, possibly man-made drainage
crossing the APE between Redbud Drive and Magnolia Drive. The nearest natural water source
is a small intermittent tributary of Mustang Creek approximately 100 meters east of the north end
of the APE. The tributary joins Mustang Creek approximately one mile to the south, near US 80,
and Mustang Creek flows south 20 miles into the Trinity River. Large portions of the APE were
heavily disturbed by previous road construction and utility infrastructure installation along FM
740.

buffalograss (Coffee et al. 1980:88-90). The faunal community in this region has undergone
changes due to the expansion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. However, the species of
wildlife, which previously inhabited the area, include bobwhite, quail, pheasant, meadowlark,
field sparrow, sage grouse, lark bunting, cottontail, red fox, antelope, and deer (Coffee et al.
1980:50).
The region has a warm, temperate, humid subtropical climate that is generally mild, with periods
of extremely hot and cold weather being limited in duration. Yearly rainfall is fairly evenly
distributed, with the maximum rainfall occurring in April and May and the minimum in August.
Much of the rainfall occurs in heavy thunderstorms, with the rapid runoff allowing only limited
absorption of water by the soil. Snowfall is rare, with an average of less than 2.5 cm (1 in) falling
per year. The snowfall is generally present for less than one week. The prevailing winds vary
from south to southeast throughout the year, although northerly winds are frequent during the
winter months (Pringle 1977).
The proposed project area along FM 740 is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous-age Neylandville
Formation and Marlbrook Marl. The Neylandville Formation is clay, calcareous silty sandy
medium gray; weathers light gray and forms irregular topography. Marlbrook Marl is clay
calcareous variable amount of silt and glauconite, disseminated pyrite, phosphate nodules, and
phosphatized marine megafossils, blocky concodial fracture, light to dark gray, weathers light
gray with poor fissility, marine mega fossils (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988).

The proposed project area consists of one soil map unit; Houston Black clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes
(Pringle 1977). Houston Black series soils are deep, calcareous soils found on nearly level to
moderately sloping uplands or old alluvial terraces. The Houston Black clay, 1 to 3 percent
slopes, is about 178 cm (70 in) thick. It has a very dark gray clay A horizon about 140 cm (55 in)
thick, with the upper 15 cm (6 in) being a plow zone. Below this is the AC horizon, consisting of
a light gray clay 76 cm (30 in) deep. Finally, there is a light gray clay C horizon from 152 to over
178 cm (60-70+ in) deep (Pringle 1977).

HISTORIC OCCUPATION/UTILIZATION
The first Kaufman County settlement was started in 1840 by William P. King and a group of 40
pioneers from Holly Springs, Mississippi. The group built a fort and named it Kingâs Fort after
their leader. On July 27, 1846, King patented the survey that included Kingâs Fort to the new
state government which has recently been annexed into the United States. At that time, the
territory was part of the newly created Henderson County, and was drawn from it and established
as a separate county in February 1848. It was named for David Spangler Kaufman, a diplomat
and member of the Congress of the Republic of Texas, the legislature of the state of Texas, and
the Congress of the United States (Handbook of Texas 2006).
In 1861, Kaufman Countyâs citizens voted in favor of the stateâs secession from the Union and
during the four years of the Civil War, the county contributed several companies of soldiers, most
of whom fought in Elkanah B. Greerâs regiment. From 1880 to 1930 Kaufman County retained
its antebellum rural and agricultural character. The Texas and Pacific Railway was completed
through the northern part of the county in 1873, linking Kaufman with Longview to the east and
Dallas-Fort Worth to the west. During the mid-1890s, the Texas-Midland Railroad was
completed through Kaufman County to Garret in the south and Paris in the north (Handbook of
Texas 2006).
The 1930s and 1940s witnessed significant changes in Kaufman County as the Great Depression
and World War II affected its people. The Second World War ended the economic crisis but also
brought a sizable emigration from the county. As the population of Kaufman County and its
agricultural production declined, there were other, more positive, developments. The county was
soon served by U.S. highways 80 and 175, State highways 34 and 243, and Interstate Highway
20. Beginning in 1938, the Kaufman County Electric Cooperative made electricity widely
available to county residents and advancement in the educational level of the countyâs population
occurred after 1940 (Handbook of Texas 2006).
Development along Interstate 20 and the eastward spread of Dallas pointed toward further
commercial development in the county and continued educational advancement. The economy
depended on agribusiness, varied manufacturing, and retail sales; the northwestern part of the
county, including the project area, was increasingly tied into the growth of the city of Dallas
(Handbook of Texas 2006).
The city of Forney, in the northwestern corner of Kaufman County, has undergone a series of
transformations since the settlement of what was âBrooklynâ in 1871. According to the THC
âForneyâ site form, a Native American trail, or Kickapoo Trace, ran through the area prior to
Euro-American settlement. In the 1840s, Isaac Briscoe and Jacob Sheltman and their families
settled in what became the village of Brooklyn. The Texas & Pacific Railroad extended its line
through Brooklyn in 1873. The same year a post office was established and the town was
renamed Forney after noted Texas & Pacific Railroad official John W. Forney. By the 1890s,
Forney had established more than 50 businesses, including a bank, an opera house, and two
hotels. Railroad transport, agriculture, and timber comprised its primary economic base.
âBlackland Prairieâ hay, ranching, cotton, and other agricultural activity have provided a sound
economic base for Forney for more than 100 years. The railway continued to be a strong force in
Forney into the twentieth century. In the 1920s, Forney expanded on its transportation
development with the establishment of the Dixie Highway (US 80) and an interurban railroad.
The town suffered an economic setback during the Great Depression, but has undergone a revival
as a quaint, rural, antique shopping destination (Ellis 2007).

METHODS

The Texas Site Atlas (nueces.thc.state.tx.us) was consulted prior to beginning field work. No
surveys or previously recorded sites were mapped within a 1-km radius of the project area. The
Texas Historic Map Overlay was examined and four relevant maps were located; the 1912 USGS
Barnes Bridge Topographic Quadrangle, the 1963 USGS Forney North Topographic Quadrangle,
the United States Army Corps of Engineers 1919 Royse City Map, and the United States Army
Corps of Engineers 1936 Kaufman County Soils Map.
The project area was surveyed traveling northeast along FM 740 from US 80 to Ridgecrest Road
using reconnaissance survey. The survey began by driving the length of the APE to assess the
condition of the existing ROW. The condition of the APE was documented with digital
photographs. Since this is a reconnaissance survey, shovel testing was not conducted. This was
due to the amount and type of disturbance expected in the existing ROW and current APE. All
notes, forms, and photographs will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

RESULTS

Two structures appear on the west side of FM 740 on the 1912 USGS Barnes Bridge Topographic
Quadrangle and the United States Army Corps of Engineers 1919 Royse City Map; however, they
are not depicted on the United States Army Corps of Engineers 1936 Kaufman County Soils Map.
The 1936 Kaufman County Soils Map shows the extant white house at 900 Pinson Road but not
the two barns to the north. The house at 900 Pinson, the two barns, and three other structures are
depicted on the east side of FM 740; two just north of Bowie Street and one at the north end of
the APE on the 1963 USGS Forney North Topographic Quadrangle. No evidence of these other
three structures was observed during this survey. The 1963 USGS Forney North Topographic
Quadrangle shows a small residential area on the west side of FM 740 with five structures
adjacent to the current APE. These five structures are 903, 905, 907, 909, and 921 Pinson and
were observed during the current survey. For a description of these structures see Ellis 2007.
Starting at the southwest end, the APE begins at the intersection of US 80 and FM 740. The APE
at the interchange between US 80 and FM 740 has been disturbed by previous road construction.
There is a Fina gas station on the northwest corner. The APE is nearly level and the vegetation
consists of manicured grass as it heads northeast along FM 740 past Brazos Street and a small
mid-20th century residential neighborhood on the west side and a historic-age farm house and
outbuilding on the east side (Figures 3, 4, and 5). A buried cable runs along the west side of FM
740. The APE continues past a late 20th century residential development on both sides of FM 740
past the intersections of Bowie Street, Southlake Drive, Forestwood Drive, Azalea Drive (east),
Redbud Drive, and Magnolia Drive (west). The area between the residences and the road, the
current ROW, is disturbed by road construction, culverts, ditches, buried cables, and utility
infrastructure installation (Figures 6-10). There is one, probably man-made, drainage crossing in
the APE between Redbud and Magnolia drives. This drainage drains the late 20th century
development on the west side of FM 740. An elementary school is located on the southwest
corner of FM 741 and Ridgecrest Road and undeveloped land lies to the east of the APE north of
Redbud Drive and south of Ridgecrest Road (Figures 11 and 12). The entire APE has been
disturbed by previous road construction and the installation of culverts, buried cables, and water
and sewer lines.

Figure 3. Photograph of the south end of the project area, facing north.

No cultural material was observed during the reconnaissance survey. Modern trash was
occasionally observed in the APE and is most likely the result of road side littering. The
likelihood of prehistoric cultural deposits in this upland setting with the closest natural source of
water a very small intermittent drainage 100 meters east of the north end of the APE is minimal.
In addition, previous road construction and utility infrastructure installation have disturbed almost
the entire APE. The upland setting with very little water and the type and amount of disturbance
leaves little probability of any cultural deposits and less probability of cultural deposits with
integrity existing in the APE.
No structures of any age were identified in the APE, though structures of historic age exist
adjacent to the current APE (see Ellis 2007). The structures consisting of twelve houses, one
farm house and associated outbuilding, and two barns were outside the APE, and the surfaces at
the edge of the current project area had been disturbed.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The project consists of reconnaissance survey of existing ROW along FM 740 from US 80 to
Ridgecrest Road. The APE is 0.9 miles long and 60 feet wide, for a total of 6.5 acres of stateowned property. The APE falls completely in an upland environment and the mapped soil is
Houston Black clay found on uplands (Pringle 1977). The purpose of the cultural resources
investigation in this project area is to determine the potential for and the presence/absence of
archeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark under the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
Due to the upland setting of the project area, upland soils, the single natural shallow, intermittent
drainage 100 meters east of the north end of the APE, and the recent development and
construction in the APE, it is unlikely that the area would contain any subsurface archeological
11

deposits with contextual integrity. The reconnaissance survey of the current APE found that large
sections of the APE have been adversely affected by previous road construction, culverts, and
installation of utility infrastructure. No cultural materials were found during the reconnaissance
survey.
No historic properties were identified during the current survey. As a result of these
investigations, it is recommended that the proposed widening of FM 740 will not effect
archeological historic properties and that no further work is required.

ABSTRACT

The project consists of reconnaissance survey of existing right-of-way (ROW) along FM 741
from Bois dâArc Street to 0.6 miles east of FM 548 in Forney, Kaufman County, Texas. The
project area is approximately 2.1-miles long and the current ROW is 60 feet wide. An additional
30 ft will be necessary, for a total of 90 ft, from Mulberry Street to 0.6 miles east of FM 548. The
entire ROW consists of approximately 23.9 acres; 19.3 of which are state-owned and 6.6 acres to
be acquired. The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this project area is to conduct
an inventory or determine the potential for and the presence/absence of archeological resources
and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended,
or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas. This
work is being conducted under contract to Civil Associates, Inc., with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI
project number 30561.00.04), as a subcontractor. Fieldwork for the reconnaissance survey was
undertaken in August 2007, by Geo-Marine, Inc.
Large portions of the proposed project area were heavily disturbed by previous road construction,
and utility infrastructure installation. No cultural deposits were identified during the current
survey and the potential for finding intact deposits is considered extremely low. As a result of
these investigations, it is recommended that the proposed alterations of FM 741 from Bois dâArc
Street to 0.6 miles east of FM 548 will have no effect on archeological historic properties and that
no further work is required. Notes, forms, files, photographs, and other materials from this
project will be permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin,
Texas.

INTRODUCTION

The project consists of reconnaissance survey of existing right-of-way (ROW) along FM 741
from Bois dâArc Street to 0.6 miles east of FM 548 in Forney, Kaufman County, Texas. The
project area is approximately 2.1-miles long and the current ROW is 60 ft wide though an
additional 30 ft, for a total of 90 ft, will be necessary from Mulberry Street to 0.6 miles east of
FM 548. The entire ROW consists of approximately 23.9 acres, 19.3 of which are state-owned
property and 6.6 acres of privately owned property (Figures 1 and 2). The area of potential effect
(APE) is the current and proposed ROW. The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in
this project area is to conduct an inventory or determine the presence/absence of archeological
resources and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places as per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966,
as amended, or for designation as a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of
Texas. This work is being conducted under contract to Civil Associates, Inc., with Geo-Marine,
Inc. (GMI project number 30561.00.04), as a subcontractor.
The reconnaissance survey was undertaken on August 13, 2007, by Kristen J. Bastis, Project
Archeologist, of GMI. Melissa M. Green, also of GMI, served as Principal Investigator for the
project.
The project will consist of widening the existing rural two-lane undivided roadway to a four-lane
divided urban facility. The length of the new four-lane roadway will be 2.1 miles from Bois
dâArc Street southeast to 0.6 miles east of FM 548. The highway will remain at grade and the
vertical impact will be no greater than three to five feet below the current ground surface.
The entire APE is in an upland setting with two drainages crossing near the southeastern end of
the APE. Large portions of the APE were heavily disturbed by previous road construction and
utility infrastructure installation along FM 741.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Kaufman County is within the Texan biotic province defined by Blair (1950) as an intermediate
zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the grasslands of the
Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits of their range in
the Texan province. The vegetation within the project area is predominantly grassland with
scattered clusters of trees, with the greatest concentration of trees being found along the
drainages. Grasses expected to occur within this area include: little bluestem, big bluestem,
Indiangrass, hairgrama switchgrass, Florida paspalum, eastern gramagrass, sideoats grama, Texas
needlegrass, Virginia wildrye, Torrey silver bluestem, meadow dropseed, vine-mesquite, and
buffalograss (Coffee et al. 1980:88-90). The faunal community in this region has undergone
changes due to the expansion of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. However, the species of
wildlife, which previously inhabited the area, include bobwhite, quail, pheasant, meadowlark,
field sparrow, sage grouse, lark bunting, cottontail, red fox, antelope, and deer (Coffee et al.
1980:50).
The region has a warm, temperate, humid subtropical climate that is generally mild, with periods
of extremely hot and cold weather being limited in duration. Yearly rainfall is fairly evenly
distributed, with the maximum rainfall occurring in April and May and the minimum in August.
Much of the rainfall occurs in heavy thunderstorms, with the rapid runoff allowing only limited
absorption of water by the soil. Snowfall is rare, with an average of less than 2.8 cm (1 in) falling
per year. The snowfall is generally present for less than one week. The prevailing winds vary
from south to southeast throughout the year, although northerly winds are frequent during the
winter months (Pringle 1977).
The proposed project area along FM 741 is underlain by the Upper Cretaceous-age Neylandville
Formation and Marlbrook Marl. The Neylandville Formation is clay, calcareous silty sandy
medium gray; weathers light gray and forms irregular topography. Marlbrook Marl is clay
calcareous variable amount of silt and glauconite, disseminated pyrite, phosphate nodules, and
phosphatized marine megafossils, blocky concodial fracture, light to dark gray, weathers light
gray with poor fissility, marine mega fossils (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988).

The proposed project area consists of four soil map units: Houston Black series soils are deep,
calcareous soils found on nearly level to moderately sloping uplands or old alluvial terraces. The
Houston Black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is about 178 cm (70 in) thick. It has a very dark gray
clay A horizon about 112 cm (44 in) thick, with the upper 15 cm (6 in) being a plow zone. Below
this is the AC horizon, consisting of a light gray clay 112-152 cm (44-60 in) deep. Finally, there
is a light gray clay C horizon from 152 to over 178 cm (60-70+ in) deep. The Houston Black
clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes, has a similar but thicker profile, with the A horizon being 140 cm (55
in) thick and the AC horizon 76 cm (30 in) thick (Pringle 1977).
Heiden Series consists of deep calcareous clayey soil on uplands. These soils formed in
calcareous marine clays and shales under a cover of tall prairie grasses. Undisturbed areas have
microrelief of valleys and ridges that extend up and down the slopes. The Heiden clay 3 to 5
percent slopes consist of gently sloping soil on upland areas that slope to natural drainages. The
soil has a profile representative of the series. The plow zone is 17 cm (7 in) thick and is a dark
grayish brown clay with a moderate blocky structure. The A 1 horizon is 25 cm (10 in) thick and
consists of a dark grayish brown clay similar to the plow zone. The AC horizon is 68-122 cm
(27-48 in) and consists of an olive clay with olive and dark grayish brown mottles. The C
horizon is 122-190 cm (48-75 in) and distinctly mottled light yellowish brown, olive-yellow and
light gray massive shaly clay (Pringle 1977).
Trinity clay, frequently flooded is a nearly level soil on floodplains that are subject to frequent
and damaging floods. The surface is uneven and water stands in low places for long periods
flowing floods. Most of the acreage is used for pasture or range; however, some areas are still in
native vegetation of mixed hardwoods. The surface layer is dark-gray, calcareous clay about
15 cm (6 in) thick. The underlying soil is very dark gray calcareous clay about 139 cm (55 in)
thick. The underlying material to a depth of 198 cm (78 in) is grayish-brown calcareous clay
(Pringle 1977).

HISTORIC OCCUPATION/UTILIZATION
The first Kaufman County settlement was started in 1840 by William P. King and a group of forty
pioneers from Holly Springs, Mississippi. The group built a fort and named it Kingâs Fort after
their leader. On July 27, 1846, King patented the survey that included Kingâs Fort to the new
state government which has recently been annexed into the United States. At that time, the
territory was part of the newly created Henderson County, and was drawn from it and established
as a separate county in February 1848. It was named for David Spangler Kaufman, a diplomat
and member of the Congress of the Republic of Texas, the legislature of the state of Texas, and
the Congress of the United States (Handbook of Texas 2006).
In 1861, Kaufman County's citizens voted in favor of the state's secession from the Union and
during the four years of the Civil War, the county contributed several companies of soldiers, most
of whom fought in Elkanah B. Greerâs regiment. From 1880 to 1930 Kaufman County retained
its antebellum rural and agricultural character. The Texas and Pacific Railway was completed
through the northern part of the county in 1873, linking Kaufman with Longview to the east and
Dallas-Fort Worth to the west. During the mid-1890s, the Texas-Midland Railroad was
completed through Kaufman County to Garret in the south and Paris in the north (Handbook of
Texas 2006).
The 1930s and 1940s witnessed significant changes in Kaufman County as the Great Depression
and World War II affected its people. The Second World War ended the economic crisis but also
brought a sizable emigration from the county. As the population of Kaufman County and its
agricultural production declined, there were other, more positive, developments. The county was
soon served by U.S. highways 80 and 175, State highways 34 and 243, and Interstate Highway
20. Beginning in 1938, the Kaufman County Electric Cooperative made electricity widely
available to county residents and advancement in the educational level of the county's population
occurred after 1940 (Handbook of Texas 2006).
Development along Interstate 20 and the eastward spread of Dallas pointed toward further
commercial development and continued educational advancement in the county. The economy
depended on agribusiness, varied manufacturing, and retail sales; the northwestern part of the
county, including the project area, was increasingly tied into the growth of the city of Dallas
(Handbook of Texas 2006).
The city of Forney, in the northwestern corner of Kaufman County, has undergone a series of
transformations since the settlement of what was âBrooklynâ in 1871. According to the THC
âForneyâ site form, a Native American trail, or Kickapoo Trace, ran through the area prior to
Euro-American settlement. In the 1840s, Isaac Briscoe and Jacob Sheltman and their families
settled in what became the village of Brooklyn. The Texas & Pacific Railroad extended its line
through Brooklyn in 1873. The same year a post office was established and the town was
renamed Forney after noted Texas & Pacific Railroad official John W. Forney. By the 1890s,
Forney had established more than 50 businesses, including a bank, an opera house, and two
hotels. Railroad transport, agriculture, and timber comprised its primary economic base.
âBlackland Prairieâ hay, ranching, cotton, and other agricultural activity have provided a sound
economic base for Forney for more than 100 years. The railway continued to be a strong force in
Forney into the twentieth century. In the 1920s, Forney expanded on its transportation
development with the establishment of the Dixie Highway (US 80) and an interurban railroad.
The town suffered an economic setback during the Great Depression, but has undergone a revival
as a quaint, rural, antique shopping destination (Ellis 2007).

METHODS

The Texas Site Atlas (nueces.thc.state.tx.us) was consulted prior to beginning field work. No
surveys or previously recorded sites are mapped within a 1-km radius of the APE. The Texas
Historic Map Overlay was examined and two relevant maps were located; the 1963 USGS Forney
South Topographic Quadrangle and the United States Army Corps of Engineers 1936 Kaufman
County Soils Map.
The project area was surveyed traveling southeast along FM 741 from Bois dâArc Street to 0.6
miles east of FM 548 using reconnaissance survey. The survey began by driving the length of the
APE to assess the condition of the existing ROW. There are two drainages crossing near the
southeastern end of the APE. The condition of the APE was documented with digital
photographs. Shovel testing was not conducted due to the amount and type of disturbance
expected in the existing ROW and current APE. All notes, forms, and photographs will be
permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

RESULTS

The 1963 USGS Forney South Topographic Quadrangle and the United States Army Corps of
Engineers 1936 Kaufman County Soils Map show structures adjacent to the current APE. There
are 16 structures on the 1936 Kaufman County Soils Map; seven outside the city limits and nine
inside the city limits. There are eight new structures inside the city limits and one outside the city
limits on the 1963 USGS Forney South Topographic Quadrangle. For a complete description of
these buildings see Ellis 2007.
The entire APE is situated in a nearly level, upland setting with two drainages crossing near the
southeastern end of the APE. Starting at the northwest end, the APE begins at the intersection of
Bois dâArc Street and FM 741. Old Forney High School is located at the intersection of Bois
dâArc Street and FM 741 (Figure 3). The north and south sides of FM 741 are developed with
early to mid-20th century residences from Bois dâArc Street along FM 741, 1500 ft southeast of
the intersection, ending with the indefinite boundary of the city limits of Forney (see Figure 2).
The existing ROW has been disturbed by the road construction and culvert and utility installation
(Figures 4, 5, and 6). To the southeast of the boundary are two large, recent subdivisions (Figure
7). The subdivision on the south side of FM 741, The Trails at Chestnut Meadow, stretches east
to the elementary school. The subdivision on the north side of FM 741 stretches east to the Beary
Best Academy at the corner of Hollyleaf Trail and FM 741. The Baptist Church lies to the east of
Hollyleaf Trail. The existing ROW has been disturbed by road construction, culverts and utility
installation (Figures 8, 9, and 10). Mustang Creek crosses the APE east of the Baptist church.
The installation of the bridge over Mustang Creek has also disturbed the existing ROW. East of
FM 548, the north side of the APE is undeveloped agricultural land. The south side is recently
developed with seven residences, just west of FM 548 (Figure 11). Approximately 270 meters
east of FM 548 a small tributary of Mustang Creek, a shallow, intermittent drainage with sloping,
vegetated banks, crosses the APE. The construction of the bridge over the tributary has also
disturbed the existing ROW. Just to the east of the tributary, up on the hill, is the newly
constructed Forney High School and Ellen Brooks Library (Figure 12). The APE continues east
for another 500 meters past the high school, with undeveloped land on both sides of FM 741. The
entire APE is vegetated with mown grass with trees adjacent to the drainage banks. The APE is
generally level except for the area around Mustang Creek and its tributary (Figures 13 and 14).

No structures of historic age were identified in the existing ROW. Structures of historic age were
observed adjacent to the APE (see Ellis 2007). The structures consist of sixteen residences
constructed before 1963.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The project consists of reconnaissance survey of existing ROW along FM 741 from Bois dâArc
Street to 0.6 miles east of FM 548. The APE is approximately 2.1 miles long and the ROW is
60 ft wide on either side of FM 741 from Bois dâArc Street to Mulberry Street and 90 ft on either
side of FM 741 from Mulberry to 0.6 miles east of FM 548. The APE falls completely in an
upland setting and the mapped soils are mostly upland soils with a narrow band of alluvial soils
along Mustang Creek. The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this project area is to
determine the potential for and the presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate
identified resources for their eligibility for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places as
per Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or for designation
as a State Archeological Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Due to the upland setting of the project area, the recent development and construction in the APE,
it is unlikely that the area would contain any subsurface archeological deposits with contextual
integrity. The reconnaissance survey of the existing ROW, which varies in width from 60 to90 ft,
found that large sections of the APE have been adversely affected by previous construction and
utility infrastructure installation. No cultural materials were found on the surface during the
10

survey. No historic properties were identified during the current survey. As a result of these
investigations, it is recommended that the proposed widening of FM741 from Bois dâArc Street
to 0.6 miles east of FM 548 will not effect archeological historic properties and that no further
work is required.
