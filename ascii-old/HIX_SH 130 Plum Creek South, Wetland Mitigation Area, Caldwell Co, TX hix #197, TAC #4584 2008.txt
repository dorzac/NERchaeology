Abstract

ABSTRACT
Under TAC Permit# 4584, archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted
intensive archeological survey of approximately 93 acres of proposed Stream and
Wetland Mitigation Areas along Plum Creek in northern Caldwell County, Texas.
At the time of survey, right of entry was only granted to those portions of the
undertaking that lie south of the creek. Survey of the northern portions of the
mitigation area have been delayed to a later date following right of entry or
acquisition of right-of-way. All survey was conducted on private land that is
slated for TxDOT acquisition, and completed in a manner that met/exceeded the
Texas Historical Commissionâs minimum survey standards for area survey.
Through the course of the survey archeologists excavated a total of 53 shovel
tests (in wetland areas with depths of impact less than two feet/61 cm) and five
backhoe trenches (in deep water areas whose maximum depth of impact was five
feet/460 cm), locating a single previously unrecorded surficial and shallowlyburied prehistoric lithic scatter (41CW111) in the northwest corner of the study
area and two isolated lithic finds. The site lacked any cultural elements
(diagnostics, features, etc.) that would warrant its inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark. The project
area overall bore evidence of repeated disturbance from grading and agricultural
activities and was generally very low in potential for containing intact cultural
resources within the projectâs depth of impact. Archeologists followed a no
collection policy during the survey, however, all project related documents and
photographs will be submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
for curation. It is the opinion of the Principal Investigator that construction on
portions of the Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation Area located south of
the creek (including the 93 acres of wetland areas that will receive various
degrees of surficial or subsurfical impacts, six acres of wetland areas that will
not receive surficial or subsurfical impacts, and an unimpacted 49 acre buffer
zone) should be allowed to proceed with no further work required and no historic
properties affected.

Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
On July 17, 2002 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) issued an
individual permit (#199600228) to the Austin District of the Texas Department
of Transportation (TxDOT) authorizing the discharge of dredged and fill material
into Waters of the United States as part of the State Highway (SH) 130
construction. The 404 permit required the mitigation of unavoidable adverse
impacts to Waters of the U.S. in accordance with the Conceptual Mitigation Plan,
Proposed State Highway 130, Texas Turnpike Authority, USACE-Fort Worth
District Project #199600228. The conceptual mitigation plan will result in the
enhancement and creation of approximately 63 acres of Waters of the U.S. on
approximately 175 acres of streamside/floodplain habitat. These 175 acres
would be developed within a 265 acre tract called the Plum Creek Stream and
Wetland Mitigation Area along Plum Creek in Caldwell County, Texas. The
project is funded by the Austin District of the Texas Department of
Transportation.
The Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation Area is subject to Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Texas
Antiquities Code as the project area will be owned and controlled by TxDOT and
Caldwell County. The proposed Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation
Area is located along Plum Creek, just west of US 183 and the proposed SH 130
right-of-way. The project area will encompass 265 acres, however only 175
acres of this property will be utilized for wetlands mitigation. The remaining 90
acres are considered an unimpacted buffer zone.
Of these 175 acres,
approximately 153 acres will be directly impacted to a depth of between two feet
and five feet below ground surface. The 265 acres represent the total Area of
Potential Effect (APE) and will consist of unaffected areas, riparian woodlands,
wetlands, deepwater areas, and streambeds (Figure 1). The 153 acres represent
the limits of actual construction to a depth of up to five feet (1.52 m). There are
no previously recorded archeological sites within the proposed project area.
Under the Exclusive Development Agreement between TxDOT and Lone Star
Infrastructure (LSI), LSI is responsible for providing a mitigation plan and
acquiring and developing the land within the mitigation area. Hicks & Company
was contracted by LSI to perform the cultural resources investigations prior to
development of the property.
These investigations were conducted in
accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended,
and 36 CFR 800, the Secretary of the Interiorâs Standards and Guidelines for
Archaeology and Historic Preservation (48 FR 44716-44742), and the Secretaryâs
Standards for Identification (48 FR 44720-44723), the Texas Antiquities Code (13
TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.5(35), 13 TAC 26.20(1), and 13 TAC 26.20(2)), and the
Protocol for Historic Property Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment for the
SH 130 Project, the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the
THC, the FHWA, TxDOT, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
After receipt of a Texas Antiquities Permit (TAC #4584), Hicks & Company
conducted intensive survey investigations within the southern half of the project
area (99 acres plus an undetermined buffer). At the time of survey there is no
right-of-entry for the portions of the mitigation area on the north side of Plum
Creek. This report presents the results of investigations for the areas on the
south side of Plum Creek only. Survey of all parcels of the mitigation area
located on the north side of the creek will be relegated to a date yet to be
determined after right-of-entry has been granted or right-of-way has been
acquired.

Introduction and Management Summary

The field investigations consisted of an intensive areal survey of 93 acres of
wetland areas affected by construction and six acres of wetland areas not
affected by construction. Survey included visual inspection of the ground
surface and subsurface testing (where necessary) in the form of shovel tests and
backhoe trenches. The entirety of the survey area is currently under private
ownership with TxDOT taking possession of the property at a future date. A
total of 53 shovel tests and five backhoe trenches were excavated within the
proposed project area. Of these, seven shovel tests were positive for cultural
material. None of the backhoe trenches contained cultural material. As a result
of the intensive survey, one previously unrecorded site, 41CW111, was identified
in the proposed project area. This site consisted of a low density scatter of
prehistoric lithic debitage and burned rock, primarily identified on the ground
surface. The boundaries of Site 41CW111 extend at least to a fenceline just
beyond the limits of the proposed project area. It is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that Site 41CW111 does not contain significant archeological
deposits that warrant inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) or for listing as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). No other
archeological sites or features or any other indications of significant cultural
resources were identified within the proposed project area. Construction for the
undertaking has been recommended to proceed with no historic properties
affected on the south side of Plum Creek.
The field investigations were conducted between October 31 and November 2,
2007. Mason Miller served as the Principal Investigator for the project and
supervised the field investigations and report production. John A. Campbell
served as Project Archeologist responsible for background research, field
supervision, and report contributions. The field crew consisted of Matt Stotts
and Bradford Jones. The results of the intensive survey are presented in the
subsequent chapters. No artifacts were collected during the course of the
investigations. All relevant project documents and photos will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas upon
approval of the final report.

DEFINITION OF PROPOSED ACTION AND IMPACTS
The proposed Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation Area is located in
Caldwell County, Texas within the Blackland Prairie physiographic province.
The project area consists of mixed pasture and cropland with riparian zones
along the margins of Plum Creek. The proposed Plum Creek Stream and
Wetland Mitigation Area is divided into four different mitigation areas of aquatic
resources: riparian woodlands, wetlands, deepwater areas, and streambeds
(Figure 2-Survey Map). These four types of areas are summarized below as to
their nature and cumulative impact.
Riparian Woodlands (PL RWs and PR RWs)
There will be two different zones of riparian woodlands; both of these are nonwetland zones. The first zone will be riparian woodlands to preserve in place.
These areas contain existing riparian woodland environments along the stream
margins; there will be no direct impacts in these zones. These zones total 15.3
acres of the total mitigation area. The second zone will be planted riparian
woodlands. These areas total 92.7 acres and direct impacts in these areas will
be limited to the surface. Impacts consist of manually or machine planting
seedlings.

Introduction and Management Summary

Wetlands (EWs and FSWs)
These areas will be new wetlands and are divided into emergent wetlands and
forest/scrub wetlands. Both of these areas will be excavated to depths of 18 to
24 inches below ground surface to create persistent wetland hydrology. These
areas will also be planted with emergent species and wetland-adapted woody
trees. Combined, these two areas total 43.1 acres.
Deepwater Areas (DPs)
There are nine deepwater areas within the Plum Creek Stream and Wetland
Mitigation Area totaling 17.6 acres. These areas will be excavated to a depth of
two to five feet below ground surface. Due to the deep impacts and the potential
for buried archeological sites, these areas required backhoe trenches to satisfy
the minimum survey standards of the THC. Machine excavations targeted areas
of high archeological site probability while minimizing physical disturbance to
the surrounding environment.
Streambeds
Streambeds within the mitigation area total 6.4 acres. There are no proposed
impacts to these areas. No archeological investigations are recommended within
these locations.

Survey Methods and Technique
Shovel testing in the survey area in all instances was conducted at a rate that
met or exceeded the THCâs minimum standards for areal survey: one test per
two acres of wetland area.2 In all instances, shovel testing depths were
determined by the proposed depths of impact for the wetland area in which the
test was placed. For planted riparian woodlands, shovel testing terminated at
50 centimeters below the ground surface. This depth was determined to fully
investigate potential surface and subsurface impacts from mechanical sapling
planting while not disturbing sediments deeper in the soil column.
For
emergent wetlands and forested/scrub wetlands, shovel testing terminated at
70-80 centimeters below the surface, again investigating to the maximum depth
of impact for those zones. For proposed deepwater areas, backhoe trenches did

1 Table shows total acreages for full wetland mitigation area. Since access was only granted to the southern half of
the study area, actual surveyed acres are lower. South of the creek planted riparian woodlands emergent wetlands
and forested/scrub wetlands total 83 acres. 9.5 acres constitute the deep water areas. Unimpacted preserved riparian
woodlands and stream beds total six acres. The remaining acreages are located north of Plum Creek.
2 Hicks & Company combined all like wetland areas (all emergent wetlands, all preserved riparian woodlands, etc.)
and calculated a total acreage for each of these similar impact zones. That combined total acreage was used to
determine the shovel testing interval required for that impact area. In all instances each wetland area acreage (aside
from the streambeds, which were not shovel tested) were greater than 10 but less than 101, thus requiring a shovel
testing interval of one test per two acres.

not extend below the maximum depth of impact of five feet (1.5m). Streambed
and preserved riparian woodlands, where no impacts are proposed, were solely
surface inspected. The 49-acre buffer zone was not surveyed given the fact that
current engineering plans do not call for any impacts whatsoever to this portion
of the undertakingâs APE.

Environmental Setting and Geology

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING AND GEOLOGY
The proposed Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation Area is located in
Caldwell County, Texas within the Blackland Prairie physiographic province.
The regional ecology is a grassland characterized by gentle topography and in its
natural state is predominantly covered with native grasses including little
bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), Indian
grass (Sorghastrum nutans), and tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper) in the uplands
and eastern grama grass (Tripsacum dactyloides) and switch grass (Panicum
virgatum) in the lowlands (Gould 1975). The generally southeasterly trending
rivers and streams are also home to elm, cottonwood, pecan, oak, and
sugarberry trees. Today much of the region is agricultural land, with an
emphasis on cotton, corn, milo and wheat, a use that it has been prized for
since significant European settlement began in the region. Blair (1950:101-102)
notes an array of mammal species including deer, rabbit, coyote, bobcat, as well
as many reptiles, amphibians, and snails are typical of this region.
Vegetation in the specific project area consists of species typical of mesquite
savannah and pasture with a strip of riparian woodland adjacent to Plum Creek
(Figure 3). Currently, the project area is used for agriculture (primarily
pastureland) (Figure 4).

Introduction and Management Summary

Figure 4

View of agricultural field within the project area.

The project area is situated within late Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits and
recent alluvium. To the south of the project area the underlying bedrock
consists of the Eocene Wills Point formation sands and clays and to the north
are the Upper Cretaceous Navarro Group and Marlbrook Marl clays (BEG 1974).
Soils in the project area are predominantly the alluvial Trinity soils and clays
(Lowther and Werchan 1978). Both Trinity clay (Tr) and Trinity soils, frequently
flooded (Ts) are found within the project area. These soils consist of deep, nearly
level, calcareous clay characterized by a surface layer of dark-gray calcareous
clay overlying gray calcareous clay with slickensides and some calcium
carbonate concretions. The uplands surrounding the project area consist of
Heiden, Branyon, and Houston Black clays. Three different Heiden series soils
are present in the project area, south of Plum Creek: Heiden-Ferris complex
(HhF3), Heiden Clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes, eroded (HeC2), and Heiden Clay, 5 to
8 percent slopes (HeD2). These soils all tend to consist of a surface layer of darkgrayish brown calcareous clay overlying light olive-brown mottled clay. Branyon
clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (BrB) is present in the project area. These soils are
typically characterized by 20 inches (50.8 cm) of dark-gray, calcareous clay on
the surface underlain by 17 inches (43 cm) of gray calcareous clay with a few
calcium carbonate concretions. These overlay about 16 inches (40.6 cm) of
light-gray calcareous clay resting on a light yellowish-brown silty clay mixed
with calcium carbonate and limestone gravels.

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The prehistoric cultures of central Texas are defined as nomadic huntergatherers from the Paleoindian until well into the historic period. Most of the
chronologies for central Texas are based on four distinct periods, representing a
12,000-year sequence of occupation. This sequence from Collins (2004) is as
follows: Paleoindian (ca. 11,500-8,800 B.P.), Archaic (8,800-1,200 B.P.), Late
Prehistoric (1,200-400 B.P.), and Historic (400 B.P.-present). Although these
divisions represent arbitrary temporal categories, they are also based in large
part on perceived adaptations in subsistence, and are reflected in changes in
lithic and other technologies. Central Texas is one of the better-known regions
of the state archeologically.
More sites have been recorded, tested and
excavated in this area than in any other part of the state (Black 1989).
The Plum Creek Stream and Wetland Mitigation Area falls within the Blackland
Prairie archeological region, which is somewhat underrepresented in terms of
prehistoric site density. Intact prehistoric sites tend to be clustered along first
order streams, with only occasional minor sites in between. It has been
suggested that prehistoric utilization of this region was intermittent, or confined
mainly to the riparian arteries along major waterways (Brownlow 2003).
Researchers have tended to link the low archeological site density within the
Blackland Prairie to limited water supply and the lack of large mammals such as
bison and pronghorn antelope (Shafer and Bryant 1976), forcing the nomadic
hunter-gatherers who moved through this region on their seasonal migrations to
adhere to the waterways. However, cultural and territorial forces must also be
acknowledged. The fact is, the Blackland Prairie is located at the intersection of
several archeologically distinctive culture areasâthe hunter-gatherer burned
rock cultures of the north and west, the coastal groups to the east, and the
Caddoan tribes of the Post Oak Savannah/Eastern Woodlands. One final
explanation for the low occurrence of prehistoric sites on the Blackland Prairie is
that many prehistoric archeological sites were no doubt destroyed by farming
and intensive agricultural use of the Blackland Prairie during the latter half of
the nineteenth century.
Based on what is known about the prehistoric environment it seems probable
that prehistoric occupation of the Blackland Prairie would have required the
utilization of both plateau and prairie resources with considerable seasonal
mobility between the two (Potter 2006; Ricklis and Collins 1994). While lithic
reduction areas are not uncommon and burned rock middens are not completely
absent from the region, most of the occupation sites in the Blackland Prairie
represent short-term campsites in open, unprotected areas situated on alluvial
terraces adjacent to streams or rivers (Black 1989). Many central Texas
archeological sites located along the larger waterways, such as the Colorado
River, the San Gabriel River, and Brushy Creek, have also been deeply buried by
Holocene alluvium (Johnson 2000). A typical open occupation site in central
Texas contains refuse such as chert flaking debris, broken chert tools,
fragmented burned rock, land snails, fragmented animal bone and charred plant
remains within the context of a cooking facility such as an oven or a stone
hearth. An additional characteristic of open sites is the presence of diagnostic
stone tools often representing occupations from different periods or phases and
ultimately suggesting repeated use over hundreds or perhaps thousands of
years.
Buried intact prehistoric occupation sites are typically considered
archeologically significant when identified.

Cultural Background

Though indigenous groups have a long history in the region, including the
presence of historically documented Tonkawa, Karankawa, and Comanche
groups, the area that would become known as Caldwell County was not settled
by Europeans until the early 19th century (Smyrl 2007). Originally part of Green
DeWittâs 1825 grant from the Mexican government and later included as part of
Gonzales County in 1836, Caldwell County was formally organized in March of
1848. The county seat, Lockhart, was established at this time as well.
The earliest settlements, beginning in the 1820âs and 1830âs, were located along
the San Marcos River and Plum Creek. Population growth was fairly rapid
throughout much of the nineteenth century as new communities formed within
Caldwell County. The early economic focus of the residents of Caldwell County
was agricultural, especially livestock. Though negatively impacted by the Civil
War and Reconstruction, the local economy remained viable with its ongoing
focus on livestock, an industry which peaked in the 1880âs and 1890âs. After the
1890âs the economy became increasingly dependent on cotton farming until
cotton harvests began to decline in the 1920âs, resulting in the growth of more
diversified farming and ranching industry. The agriculture focus of the economy
also shifted in 1922 with the discovery of oil. Though the amount of oil
produced in the county has declined over time, oil production has served as an
important economic resource for the county (Smyrl 2007).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of the files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory and the
Texas Historical Commission indicates that there are no previously recorded
archeological sites within the APE. In addition, there have been no previous
investigations conducted within the APE. There are four archeological sites
within 1000 meters of the proposed project area, 41CW81, 41CW82, 41CW89,
and 41CW90. Site 41CW81 is a historic farmstead and prehistoric lithic scatter
with some historic structural elements and shallow archeological deposits. Site
41CW82 is a prehistoric lithic scatter identified within the top 30 centimeters of
sediment and has no associated features. Site 41CW89 is a prehistoric and
historic artifact scatter that has an associated historic age cistern; artifacts at
this site were limited to the surface. Finally, Site 41CW90 is a historic farm
complex with three structures, a cistern, and an associated artifact scatter
found in the upper 10 centimeters of sediment. All of these sites were recorded
by PBS&J in 2001 and 2002 as part of their intensive survey of the SH 130
right-of-way. All four of these sites were determined to be ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP as a result of PBS&Jâs investigations. In addition to PBS&Jâs
survey of the proposed SH 130, the United States Soil Conservation Service
conducted a survey immediately north of the project area in 1983 and identified
no archeological sites. Although the closest archeological sites are all located in
upland settings, the probability for intact archeological sites along Plum Creek is
moderate to low due to the tributary nature of the stream and the upland setting
of its surroundings.

Results of Field Investigations

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
At the time of survey, Hicks & Company archeologists were granted access solely
to portions of the proposed wetlands located south of Plum Creek, an area
encompassing approximately 99 total acres (93 acres of subsurface impact areas
and six acres not slated for impacts). Survey of the remaining study area north
of the creek has been relegated to a later date after right-of-entry has been
granted or right-of-way has been acquired. During the course of survey,
researchers investigated 57.5 acres of proposed planted riparian woodlands, 14
acres of proposed emergent woodlands, 2.5 acres of proposed forested scrub
wetlands, and five proposed deep water areas. Archeologists visually inspected
the full project area and excavated a total of 53 shovel tests (seven positive) in all
non-deep water areas that were subject to ground-disturbing activity and five
backhoe trenches in deep water areas, documenting one minor, severely
disturbed lithic scatter site (Site 41CW111) and two additional isolated finds.
The project area in general was found to be severely disturbed by repeated
agricultural (plowing, planting, etc.) and landscape grading activities over an
extended period of time and lacked potential for containing significant intact
cultural resources within the projectâs prescribed depths of impact. Below is a
brief description of the results of this survey and the findings made therein
beginning with intensive surface survey and shovel testing.

PROJECT AREA CONDITIONS
The Plum Creek Mitigation Area south of Plum Creek sits in a flat, open
floodplain at the bottom of a steep, bowl-shaped terrace that dominates the view
to the south and west while the floodplain continues to the east (Figure 3). The
propertyâs current lessor indicated that the creek generally had two stages: dry
and overflowing. He mentioned that at times the water would reach the tops of
some of the smaller trees close to the creek channel with large logs left
suspended in the branches following the waterâs recession. Closest to the creek,
the terrain is somewhat undulating with a dense population of riparian
woodland plants. Immediately beyond this zone (to the south of the creek), the
vegetation and terrain immediately changes to a somewhat undulating, open
pasture with opportunistic scrub plants (broomweed and ragweed) to the east,
and flat pastures with short, manicured ranch grasses in the center and tall,
harvested hay and grasses to the west (Figures 4, 5 and 6).
The propertyâs lessor indicated that the land is planted and harvested regularly,
which was corroborated particularly for the central and western portions of the
project area with extensive linear plantings and plow ruts and generally very
good surface visibility (80+%; Figure 4). The eastern portion of the project area
(beginning east of the fenceline immediately east of EW #3) was not cultivated
regularly, but the tenant did state that at some point the land had been modified
for erosion control with ditches and cuts throughout. Then approximately 20
years ago he plowed, graded and leveled the landform, pushing ditch banks in
and leveling low spots with introduced topsoil. Generally, he estimated the
upper approximately two to three feet of soil was either plowed or composed of
fill. The predominance of broom- and ragweed (opportunistic plant species
typically found in overgrazed fields and immature ground surfaces) is a
confirmation of this activity. The overall potential for significant buried cultural
deposits within the projectâs vertical APE (particularly in the non-deep water
areas) was overall very low due to the prevalence of this mechanical modification
activity. There is a higher potential that buried sites could be found below the
areas of impacts given the prevalence of flooding (and its accompanying
deposition events).

SHOVEL TESTING
According to the TxDOT/THC-approved research design, the subsurface testing
strategy varied depending on the proposed depth of impact for a given wetland
resource area. In areas with shallow or surficial impacts (planted riparian
woodlands), testing terminated at a pre-determined depth of 50 centimeters.
Emergent wetland areas and forested scrub wetlands, whose depths of impact
ranged from one to two feet (30-61 cm), were tested to a depth of at least 70
centimeters. Areas not slated for ground-disturbing construction activities
(streambeds, preserved riparian woodlands) were surface inspected only. Of the
53 shovel tests excavated during the course of survey, seven tests were positive
for cultural materials (Figure 2: Negative Shovel tests have been omitted for
visual clarity). While five positive tests were found during the investigation of
Site 41CW111, two non-site tests unearthed isolated finds of single artifacts.
Isolated finds in shovel tests were investigated with three to four additional tests
excavated approximately 10-15 meters away from the find location. All of these
tests were negative.
As can be seen in Table 2, of the 53 shovel tests that were excavated during the
course of survey of 83 total acres south of Plum Creek, seven tests were positive
for cultural material. All positive tests were limited to the western-most portions
of the project area, including those tests excavated during the investigation of
Site 41CW111, a minor, severely disturbed surficial and shallowly-buried lithic
scatter (see Site Discussion). Surface visibility was near 100% for all areas
west of- and including PLRW#6, while dense ranch grasses and ragweed and
broomweed to the east of this point reduced surface visibility to nearly 0%. The
overwhelming majority of the mitigation area was devoid of any cultural
materials. Shovel tests in the western portions of the study area were typically
composed of very dark grayish brown clay (2.5Y3/2) with gray and tan mottling
below 35 centimeters, reaching dense cobbles and gravels beginning between 50
and 70 centimeters below the surface. Moving farther east, near the center of
the study area (EW#3), soil colors transitioned to a black (7.5YR2/1), extremely
dense clay with small gravels and rabdotus (1-2%) inclusions beginning at 50
centimeters below the surface. Finally, in areas closest to the eastern terminus,
the soils were moist and dense, situated on a visible low point on the landform.
Soil coloration was generally similar though with a distinctly higher silt and
content (grey in color; 20-50 cmbs) with bands of sand indicating repeated
flooding. Shovel tests farther to the south, closer to the base of the hillslopes,
were generally similar in soil composition to those dug closer to the creek but
were higher in small gravel and sand content.

Results of Field Investigations

The seven positive shovel tests, limited to the western quarter of the project area
all encountered artifacts within clearly disturbed, plowed contexts. Five of the
positive shovel tests (MS2, MM2, JC2 and BJ1 and 2) were located within the
boundaries of Site 41CW111. Along with a variety of relatively abundant chert
flakes, cores and chunks intermixed with mechanically flaked cobbles (results of
repeated plowing and cattle traffic) visible on the surface in their vicinity,
contents of these tests included chert flakes and shatter (JC2, BJ2, MM2 and
MS2), burned rock fragments (BJ2) and mussel shell (JC2, BJ1) in the upper 35
centimeters (particularly between 0 and 20 centimeters below the surface). The
recovery of clear glass fragments below artifacts in Shovel Test BJ2 (20-30 cmbs)
corroborates the surficial indications of site disturbance (for more detailed
information, see Site Discussion).
The isolated find at MS5, in the central portion of PLRW#7B, consisted of a
single chert flake between 20 and 30 centimeters in thick black clay loam.
Thorough surface inspection in the vicinity and three nearby negative shovel
tests were devoid of any complimentary artifacts or other materials. The isolated
find at MM4, in the southern half of FSW#2 contained a single large secondary
retouched flake/uniface made of yellowish brown chert between 12 and 17
centimeters below the surface. The artifact was found in an open field with a
moderate scatter of surficial chert cobbles with clear evidence of mechanical
chipping. The flake did appear to have suffered repeated modification from
plowing as many of the flake scars appeared very recent and mechanically
generated. No other materials were found within the test, in four surrounding
shovel tests or on the ground surface despite thorough surface inspection.
In general shovel testing throughout the Plum Creek Wetland Mitigation site
indicates that proposed construction in the area has a relatively very low
potential for impacting significant cultural resources.
The overwhelming
majority of tests were negative for any artifacts or indications of historic cultural
activity and those that were positive were either isolated finds or limited to a
minor, heavily modified lithic scatter.

BACKHOE TRENCHING
Archeologists from Hicks & Company excavated a total of five backhoe trenches
within the five proposed deep water areas (approximately 10 acres) during their
field investigations at the Plum Creek Mitigation area (Figure 2). Construction
at each of these deep water areas, were limited to a minimum of two to a
maximum depth of five feet (1.5 m). As such, all trenching was limited to this
maximum depth of impact. As per the surveyâs approved research design, each
deep water area was investigated with one deep backhoe trench, to confirm a
presence or absence of cultural materials. Each trench measured approximately
100 centimeters in width with a length of approximately 390-460 centimeters.
None of the trenches (Trenches 1-5) contained cultural materials or any other
evidence of significant historic or prehistoric cultural activity.
Soils observed during trenching were generally composed of three to four
horizons of black, gray or dark brown clays and silty clays with occasional
trenches containing shell, gravels, introduced topsoil or sand.
Trenches
excavated closest to Plum Creek in the western half of the survey area were the
only ones to contain significant inclusions of large gravels.
This is an
anticipated phenomenon since the highest energy flood deposits (those capable
of carrying large cobbles such as those found) would be typically limited to areas
closest to the main channel. Soils contained in Trench 1, typical of this portion
of the study area (BHT 1 in DP #9) were composed of 20 centimeters of 2.5Y3/2

(very dark grayish brown) compact clay topsoil followed by 43 centimeters of
10YR4/2 (dark grayish brown) very compact silty clay. Occasional chert and
quartzite cobbles were scattered throughout these upper soil horizons. The final
95 centimeters composed of 2.5Y5/3 light olive brown very gravelly (60+%),
dense clay. Figure 7 shows the soils observed in Backhoe Trench 3, excavated
near the center of the study area in DP #7. Soils in this trench were generally
very similar to those in Trench 1 with a slight increase in calceration in the
upper 50 centimeters and a prominent cobble lense from 100-115 centimeters
below the surface. Neither of the trenches contained any evidence of cultural
activity or artifacts.

Figure 7

Backhoe Trench 3 East Wall Profile

Backhoe Trench 2, dug in DP #8 at the base of the southern terrace, was
distinctly different than those closer to the creek. Soils observed in this trench
were generally more uniform with 2.5Y3/1-4/2 (Dark gray to dark grayish
brown) silty and very silty clays throughout its 158-centimeter observed column.
Micro-shell fragments were noted in the upper 50 centimeters while small
pebbles were recorded in the next 30 centimeters of sediments. This column is
typical of the much lower-energy depositional environment in which it was
found, with a generally more homogenous soil column that lacks larger (and
heavier) gravels and cobbles. Again this trench was devoid of cultural materials.
Trenches dug in the eastern half of the study area, near Streambed # 2 (DP#s 5
and 6/ Trenches 5 and 4 respectively) were generally composed of 2.5Y3/1-4/2
dense, moist silty clays through three to four horizons in the soil column (Figure
8). From approximately 30-70 centimeters below the surface, both trenches
contained a distinct zone of increased mottling with minor gravel and shell
inclusions. Included within this mottling (particularly in Trench 4) were isolated
pockets of 7.5YR4/4 (brown) dense clays that have been interpreted as
introduced topsoil clods that have not been assimilated into the surrounding
sediments (as indicated by communication with the propertyâs lessor). Trench 5
did contain a notable pocket of charcoal near its base at 145-150 centimeters,
however despite thorough representative screening and profile cleaning, no

accompanying artifacts were observed. As such the charcoal was interpreted as
a natural phenomenon and not investigated further. No cultural materials were
observed within either of the trenches excavated in the eastern half of the study
area.

SITE 41CW111
Site 41CW111 is a prehistoric lithic scatter site of unknown age located in the
northwest corner of the project area. The site is situated in a field that is
currently being utilized for the cultivation of hay (Figure 9). The site was
identified based on the presence of lithic debitage, a core, burned rock, and
mussel shell primarily on the surface, but also present up to approximately 35
centimeters below the surface. The site size as mapped is 115 meters by 100
meters (2.84 acres) and was established based on the presence of artifacts on
the surface and in six shovel tests (Figure 10). Surface densities of artifacts
were highest in an approximately 20 x 20 meters area around Shovel Test JC#1,
where artifact counts typically numbered between one and five artifacts in a
meter square. Outside of this area and within the site boundaries, density was
dramatically lower. By the outer boundary of the site (primarily defined spatially
through surface finds) artifacts were separated by 20 to 30 meters. From the
surface collections and shovel testing, it is clear that the site is primarily located
on the surface and has been significantly disturbed as a result of repeated
cultivation. Evidence of disturbance is manifested in the recovery artifacts of
more recent vintage â a piece of clear arsenic bleached bottle glass of modern or
recent origin and a corroded cartridge shell (too corroded for accurate dating) â
mixed with prehistoric artifacts in the upper 30 centimeters of Shovel Test BJ2.
No clearly historic materials or features were identified at that location or within
the surveyed APE.

Six shovel tests were dug in order to establish site limits, depth of deposits and
to test for any intact subsurface features or surfaces. Five of the shovel tests
were positive for cultural materials (Table 3). In general cultural materials were
not present below 30-35 centimeters below depth, an observation that often
coincided with a soil transition that was characterized by a disappearance of
small chert and limestone gravels below the plow zone. Overall, artifacts
recovered from the shovel tests were unremarkable and comparable to those on
the surface.

Results of Field Investigations

Artifacts collected from the surface and in shovel tests included a variety of
prehistoric artifacts including debitage, a core, flakes with macroscopically
visible edge modification, mussel shell fragments and burned rock.
A
representative sample of artifacts collected from the surface and from the shovel
tests were photographed (Figures 11 and 12). All artifacts collected in the field
were analyzed on site and were not removed from the site boundaries. Artifacts
from the surface and shovel tests consisted of primary, secondary and tertiary
pieces of debitage, burned chert and limestone, and several flakes with notable
chipping and edge damage. Because the site is located in an active agricultural
field plowed to a depth of 28 inches (71 cm, according to property lessor) with
unmodified chert gravels present in the soil and on the surface, and the field is
grazed by cattle, there is the possibility that some of the flakes and the edge
modification observed on several of the artifacts are the result of unintentional
human or bovine modification. Nonetheless a sufficiently large sample of large
and small debitage ranging from primary to tertiary flakes was recovered that
exhibited clear signs of knapping (well defined platforms, bulbs of percussion,
multiple dorsal flake scars). These artifacts confirm that the site is prehistoric
in origin, albeit one with significant disturbance. No diagnostic artifacts were
identified which would enable the relative definition of the period of site
occupation, nor were any intact archaeological features or surfaces identified.
Based on the results of the shovel testing, surface inspection and field analysis
of the artifacts, the site is determined to be primarily a surface site located
within a clearly disturbed context. It lacks features, diagnostic artifacts or the
potential for organic preservation. It is the opinion of the principal investigator
that this site lacks sufficient integrity, organic material or potential for further
research to warrant its nomination for the NRHP or as an SAL.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Under TAC Permit 4584, archeologists surveyed the south half of the proposed
SH 130 wetland mitigation site in northern Caldwell County, Texas. Through
the course of three field days, archeologists investigated approximately 83 acres
of proposed newly created wetlands along with five proposed deep water areas
(10 acres, 93 total). Six additional acres of wetland areas slated for no
construction impacts were visually inspected. The wetlandâs 48-acre buffer zone
will be preserved in its current state and was not surveyed. One previously
undocumented minor lithic scatter site, 41CW111, was recorded during the
course of the survey. The survey was conducted in partial fulfillment of Federal
Section 106 requirements associated with the projectâs USACE Section 404
permitting process and the FHWAâs partial project funding as well as TAC
obligations related to TxDOT project funding and TxDOTâs ultimate ownership of
the wetland property following construction. All proposed shallow to moderately
impacted areas (depths of impact of less than two feet) were intensively shovel
tested at a rate that met or exceeded the THCâs minimum standards for areal
surveys, with a total of 53 tests excavated (with seven positive tests). All
proposed deep water areas (n=5), whose construction depths of impact are noted
as no greater than five feet, were intensively investigated through backhoe
trenching to that maximum construction depth.
Newly-recorded Site 41CW111 is described as a minor, highly disturbed,
surficial to shallowly-buried lithic scatter covering an area of approximately
11,500 square meters in the extreme northwest corner of the survey area.
Though one small portion of the site area contained surface artifacts at a rate of
up to approximately five artifacts per square meter, general artifact density was
extremely low throughout the site area. Of the six shovel tests excavated in the
site area, five were positive for cultural materials in the upper 35 centimeters of
sediments, though findings within these tests were again very minor and
extremely diffuse. Artifacts included cores, burned rocks, mussel shell and a
variety of debitage (many of which bore evidence of mechanical chipping from
farming activity or cattle traffic). No features were observed on the surface or
within any of the shovel tests. Shovel testing also confirmed the surficial
indications of disturbance with the presence of âmodern to recentâ historic
artifacts (glass and a gun cartridge) intermixed with and directly beneath
prehistoric artifacts. Overall, Site 41CW111 lacks any elements that would
warrant its consideration for inclusion in the NRHP or as a SAL. It is too diffuse
and disturbed and lacks any evidence of intact features, diagnostics or organic
preservation and as such, does not warrant any further investigation. No clearly
historical-age materials or features were identified in the site area or within any
other portions of the surveyed APE.
While two other isolated finds were made within the study area (two individual
flakes found in the upper 12-30 centimeters), the project area was primarily
devoid of any potential for containing intact significant cultural resources.
Throughout the study area there were abundant indications of significant
mechanical modification through agricultural activities and grading, while the
propertyâs current lessor made direct statements to this effect as well. Aside
from those tests excavated within Site 41CW111 and the two isolated finds, the
overwhelming majority of survey shovel tests and the entirety of excavated
backhoe trenches were devoid of cultural materials. With such compiled data, it
is the opinion of the projectâs Principal Investigator that the proposed Wetland
Mitigation construction undertaking/action south of Plum Creek should be

Conclusions and Recommendations

allowed to proceed to construction without further cultural resource-related
regulatory consideration or correspondence with no historic properties affected.
This recommendation includes the 83 acres of wetland areas receiving impacts
of two feet or less, 10 acres of deep water areas, six acres of wetland areas not
receiving impacts, and the 49-acre buffer zone. Since right-of-entry was not
granted to those portions of the proposed mitigation area north of Plum Creek
(116 acres of which 76 acres are slated as wetland areas), survey will be
required for those potentially impacted parcels once access is available.
