Management Summary:
In October of 2016, Ford, Powell & Carson (Client), on behalf of the Alamo Colleges, contracted with
Raba Kistner Environmental, Inc. (RKEI) to perform archaeological investigations associated with the
construction of the Alamo Colleges District Support Operation Building. Alamo Colleges plans to
construct a District Support Operations (DSO) Building on a tract of land that was the former Playland
Park which was in operation between 1942 and 1980. The project area is currently owned by Alamo
Colleges and encompasses approximately 12 acres.
A portion of the Acequia Madre de Valero (acequia), previously recorded as archaeological site 41BX8, is
located within the former Playland Park property. The Acequia Madre de Valero was one of the first
irrigation ditches constructed after the arrival of the Spanish missionaries in San Antonio. The irrigation
system in San Antonio is a National Historic Engineering Landmark, as well as a contributing element to
the San Antonio Missions World Heritage Site. Historic maps depict slight variations in the route of the
acequia across the southern half of the project area, however, the acequia’s method of construction and
have not been documented in this location. Therefore, the precise route of the acequia across the
southern portion of the formal Playland Park property is not well known. The route of the irrigation
ditch is critical both to the placement of facilities and buildings on the tract, as well as the accurate
interpretive layout associated with the feature. Therefore, this project contributed to the completion of
the present efforts by identifying the route of the ditch and at the same time allowed for the
documentation of the feature.
Given that the development will take place on land owned by a political subdivision of the state, and
funding is at least partially derived from public sources, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the City
of San !ntonio’s ?ity of San !ntonio’s Preservation Ordinance (Article VI, Historic Preservation and
Urban Design, City of San Antonio, Unified Development Code). In addition, the project also falls under
the oversight of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191) which
protects historic resources found on state land or land owned by a political subdivision of the state. All
work was performed in accordance with the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and Texas Historical
Commission (THC) Survey Standards. The field work was carried out over three days: October 3rd, 11th
and 12th, 2016. The Project was carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7804. Dr. Steve A. Tomka
served as Principal Investigator, Mark Luzmoor served as Project Archaeologist and Richard Sample and
Cindy Dickey assisted as field technicians.

The scope of work approved by Texas Historical Commission and the City of San Antonio Office of
Historic Preservation narrowed the focus of this investigation to identify the route of the buried portion
of the acequia within the property boundaries. RKEI employed two methods of field investigations to
identify the location of remnants of the acequia channel. A systematic Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)
survey of a section of the southern portion of the Area of Potential Effect (APE) was conducted to
determine if the acequia does in-fact follow one of the historic map routes. After the results of the GPR
survey were reviewed, the Project Archaeologist chose a number of locations for backhoe trenches to
determine if the acequia was present within the southern portion of the APE.
Four backhoe trenches were excavated within the project area. The Acequia Madre de Valero was
encountered in Backhoe Trench (BHT) 1. The acequia channel was cut into the underlying Houston Black
Clay and was filled with a matrix containing rusted metal artifacts. Another section of the acequia was
encountered in BHT 4, but it is likely that construction relating to Playland Park had major impacts in this
area. Neither BHT 2 nor BHT 3 revealed clear evidence of the irrigation ditch.
The results of the archaeological investigations indicate that the acequia is present within the APE and
two of the four trenches were able to define the route of the irrigation ditch across the southern half of
the project area. The findings provide sufficient information to allow for the accurate representation of
the route of the acequia through the planned development. Therefore, and in concert with opinions
expressed by the Office of Historic Preservation and the National Park Service, we recommend that the
project continue as planned and as long as the proposed designs do not impact any portion of the
acequia.
During construction, large limestone blocks were encountered identified as the foundation of the
Truehart House. RKEI was called back to the site to investigate the feature. The original TAC permit was
amended to include the exposure and documentation of the foundation. The results of the additional
work is presented in Appendix A.
All project related documents are permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin.

Chapter 1: Introduction and Area of Potential Effect
Raba Kistner Environmental (RKEI) was contracted by Ford, Powell and Carson Architects & Planners
(CLIENT) on behalf of Alamo Colleges to perform archaeological investigations associated with the
construction of the Alamo Colleges District Support Operations Building in San Antonio, Bexar County
Texas (Figure 1-1). The project area is currently owned by Alamo Colleges and encompasses 12 acres
(Figure 1-2).
As Alamo Colleges, a public education agency, is also sponsoring the construction, the project falls under
the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191)
which protects historic and prehistoric resources found on state land or land owned by a political
subdivision of the state. The Code requires that all entities that undertake developments ensure that
the proposed project(s) does not harm significant historic resources such as buried archaeological sites,
standing structures, cemeteries, etc. In addition, the project also falls under the oversight of the Office
of Historic Preservation by virtue of the ?ity of San !ntonio’s Preservation Ordinance (!rticle VI, Historic
Preservation and Urban Design, City of San Antonio, Unified Development Code).
In order to comply with these legislative mandates, RKEI archaeologists completed two related research
efforts: a ground penetrating radar survey and subsequent backhoe trenching of limited portions of the
project area. As a first step, to properly document the route of the Acequia Madre de Valero (acequia)
through the property, RKEI employed noninvasive Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). The GPR survey was
employed to identify buried linear anomalies that may correspond to the acequia channel.
Subsequently, backhoe trenching was used to “ground-truth” these anomalies and expose the feature to
allow its documentation. The Project was carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7804. Dr. Steve
A. Tomka served as Principal Investigator and Mark P. Luzmoor served as Project Archaeologist.

In July of 2017, during the construction of the Alamo Colleges District Support Operations Building, large
limestone blocks associated with the Truehart House (41BX2192) were encountered. Ford, Powell &
Carson contacted RKEI to investigate the foundation as requested by COSA-OHP. The original antiquities
permit was amended to include the foundation exposure and documentation. The results of the
additional investigations are presented in Appendix A.
Area of Potential Effect

The Alamo Colleges District Support Operations (DSO) Building will be constructed on a tract of land
bounded by Broadway Street and Fort Sam Houston in north-central San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas.
The tract selected for this facility is the former location of Playland Park, which operated between 1942
and 1980. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) is bounded by N. Alamo Street along its western edge, the
Fort Sam Houston property boundary to the east, Cunningham Avenue to the north and E. Josephine
Street at the southern margin. The APE is located on the San Antonio East (2998-133) 7.5 minute USGS
topographic quadrangle map. (Figure 1-3)
A portion of the Acequia Madre de Valero (41BX8) is visible inside of the former Playland Park property
and Cunningham Avenue crosses it roughly 305 meters (1000 feet) east of the intersection of N. Alamo
Street, Broadway Street, and Cunningham Avenue. Historic maps of the area depict slight variations in
the route of the acequia across the southern half of the tract. Historic maps will be discussed further in
Chapters 2 and 4 of this report.

Soils
Two soil types are encountered within the APE: Lewisville Silty Clay (LvB) and Houston Black Gravelly
Clay (HuC) (Web Soil Survey 2016) (Figure 1-4). Lewisville Silty Clays are the predominant soil type within
the APE. Houston Black Gravelly Clays are associated with the western extent of the APE. Lewisville Silty
Clays form as deep, well-drained deposits on uplands. These moderately permeable soils are often
found as gently sloping deposits (0-3% slope). Lewisville is formed from ancient loamy and clayey
calcareous deposits, and calcium carbonate nodules are found throughout the deposit. The silty clay
deposit is dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) from the surface to a depth of 41 cm. At this depth, the deposit
becomes a grayish brown (10YR5/2), and contains calcium carbonate nodules between 2 and 5
millimeters (mm) in diameter. The base of the deposit, found 86 to 157 cm below the surface, is pale
brown (10YR6/3) in color, and the silty clay is calcareous.
Houston Black Gravelly Clay is formed by the erosion of Cretaceous-age calcareous mudstone. Houston
clays are often found along interfluves or on side slopes within plains or dissected plains. This soil forms
as deep, moderately well-drained deposits. In the project area, this deposit is found on slopes ranging
between 3 and 5 %. The deposit is clay throughout, ranging in color from very dark gray (10YR3/1) at
the surface to gray (10YR6/1) with light olive brown mottles (2.5Y5/6) with depth. The deposit contains
weekly cemented iron-manganese and calcium carbonate nodules. Gravels composed of chert and
quartzite may be found in dense concentrations in the upper 25 cm of the deposit. Houston clays can be
identified by deep cracks that appear along the surface of the deposit when the usually most soil dries.

Chapter 2: Culture Chronology and Previous Archaeology
Culture Chronology
The cultural history of South Central Texas spans approximately 11,500 years. Archaeologists have
divided the occupation of the region into four principal periods and several sub-periods: Paleoindian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. The periods are characterized by changes in climatic conditions,
distinct vegetation types and structure, and concomitant adaptive changes by human populations in
hunting and gathering technologies and strategies, general material culture, and at the tail end of the
cultural sequence, the arrival of non-indigenous populations. The standard summaries of the culture
chronologies of Central Texas accepted by many of the regional archaeologists were produced by Collins
(1995) and Prewitt (1981). Below is a brief summary of the cultural sequence that has been
reconstructed by archaeologists for the south-central part of the State.
Paleoindian Period
The oldest cultural materials found in the region date to the Paleoindian period. The period spans
roughly from 11,500-8800 B.P. (Collins 1995, 2004). The Aubrey site in Denton County has one of the
earliest occupations, with radiocarbon assays dating to between 11,542 ± 11 B.P. and 11,590 ± 93 B.P.
(Bousman et al. 2004:48). Paleoclimatic proxy measures suggest that a cooler climate with increased
precipitation was predominant during the Late Pleistocene (Mauldin and Nickels 2001), the later portion
of the period.
Initial reconstructions of Paleoindian adaptations typically viewed these hunter-gatherers as traversing
extreme distances in pursuit of now extinct mega-fauna such as mammoth and mastodon. While these
Paleoindians populations did exploit the Late Pleistocene mega-fauna when it was accessible, a number
of faunal assemblages from an increasingly larger number of sites indicate that the Paleoindian diet was
more varied and consisted of a wide range of resources, including small game and plants. The Lewisville
(Winkler 1982) and the Aubrey sites (Ferring 2001) produced faunal assemblages that represented a
wide range of taxa, including large, medium, and small species. Information on the consumption of
plant resources during the Paleoindian period is lacking. Bousman et al. (2004) reported that the late
Paleoindian component at the Wilson-Leonard site reflected the exploitation of riparian, forest and
grassland species. Analysis of Paleoindian skeletal remains indicates that the diets of the Paleoindian
populations may have been similar to Archaic period hunter-gatherer populations (Bousman et al. 2004;
Powell and Steele 1994).

8

The early portion of the Paleoindian period was characterized by the appearance of Clovis and Folsom
fluted projectile points that were used for hunting mega-fauna. Typical projectile points produced at
sites with occupations dating to the later portion of the Paleoindian period included the Plainview,
Dalton, Angostura, Golandrina, Meserve, and Scottsbluff types. Meltzer and Bever (1995) have identified
406 Clovis sites in Texas. One of the earliest, 41RB1, yielded radiocarbon assays that put the maximum
age for the Paleoindian component at 11,415 ± 125 B.P. (Bousman et al. 2004:47).
Sites in ?exar ?ounty that contain Paleoindian components include St. Mary’s Hall (Hester 1978, 1990),
Pavo Real (Collins et al. 2003), the Richard Beene site (Thoms et al. 1996; Thoms and Mandel 2006) and
41BX1396 (Tomka 2012). St. Mary’s Hall, 41?X229, was first encountered in 1972 during the
construction of a house just outside the school’s property. The Pavo Real site, 41BX52, is located along
Leon Creek in northwest Bexar County. The site was first documented in 1970 and has been investigated
several times over the past 40 years (Collins et al. 2003). The Richard Beene site, 41BX831, is located
along the Medina River in southern Bexar County (Thoms et al. 1996). Site 41BX1396 is located in
Brackenridge Park in San Antonio, Texas, and was encountered during installations for lighting in 2010.
Dating of organic samples indicated that occupation at the site occurred as early as 10,490-10,230 BP.
Archaic Period
The Archaic Period dates between ca. 8800 to 1200 B.P. It is divided into three subperiods: Early,
Middle, and Late. During the Archaic, mobility strategies may have shifted to more frequent short
distance movements that allowed the exploitation of seasonal resource patches. The intermittent
presence of bison in parts of Texas, combined with changes is climatic conditions and the primary
productivity of the plant resources may have contributed to shifts in subsistence strategies and
associated technological repertoire. When bison were not present in the region, hunting strategies
focused on medium to small game along with continued foraging for plant resources. When bison were
available, hunter-gatherers targeted the larger-bodied prey on a regular basis.
Early Archaic
Collins (1995) suggests that the Early Archaic spans from 8800 to 6000 B.P. Projectile point styles
characteristic of the Early Archaic include Angostura, Early Split Stem, Martindale, and Uvalde (Collins
1995). The Early Archaic climate was drier than the Paleoindian period and witnessed a return to
grasslands (Bousman 1998). Mega-fauna of the Paleoindian period could not survive the new climate
and ecosystems, therefore eventually dying out. Early Archaic exploitation of medium to small fauna

9

intensified.
The Wilson-Leonard excavation produced a wealth of cultural materials representative of a lengthy
period in regional prehistory. The projectile point assemblages from the site indicate that the lanceolate
Paleoindian point forms, such as Angostura, continue from the Paleoindian into the Early Archaic.
However, these forms are replaced by corner- and basally-notched and shouldered forms (Early
Triangular, Andice, Bell), and these quickly become the dominant points tipping the atlatl-thrown darts.
In addition, the uses of small to medium hearths similar to the previous period were noted too. The
appearance of earth ovens suggests a shift in subsistence strategies. The earth ovens encountered at the
Wilson-Leonard site were used to cook wild hyacinth along with aquatic and terrestrial resources
(Collins et al. 1998). Analyses of Early Archaic human remains encountered in Kerr County (Bement
1991) reveal diets low in carbohydrates in comparison to the Early Archaic populations found in the
Lower Pecos region.
Within Bexar County, the excavations at 41BX1396 revealed an Early Archaic component that was
radiocarbon dated using pieces of charcoal to Cal B.P. 8390 to 8180 (Tomka 2012).
Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic subperiod spans from 6000 to 4000 B.P. (Collins 1995; Weir 1976). Archaeological
data indicates that populations may have increased during this time. Climate was gradually drying
leading to the onset of a long drought period. Changes to the demographics and cultural characteristics
were likely in response to the warmer and increasingly arid conditions. Projectile point styles included in
this sub-period include Bell, Andice, Calf Creek, Taylor, Nolan, and Travis.
Subsistence during the Middle Archaic includes an increased reliance on nuts and other products of
riverine environments (Black 1989). The upsurge of burned rock middens during the Middle Archaic
represented the increased focus on the use of plant resources (Black 1989; Johnson and Goode 1994).
Little is known about burial practices during the Middle Archaic, however an excavation of an Uvalde
County sinkhole (41UV4) contained 25-50 individuals (Johnson and Goode 1994:28).
Late Archaic
The Late Archaic spans from 4000 to 1200 B.P. (Collins 2004). It is represented by the Bulverde,
Pedernales, Kinney, Lange, Marshall, Williams, Marcos, Montell, Castroville, Ensor, Frio, Fairland and
Darl projectile points. The early part of the Late Archaic exhibited fluctuations in the temperature and

10

rainfall. There appears to have been an increase in population at this time (Nickels et al. 1998).
While some researchers believe that the use of burned rock middens decreased during the Late Archaic,
recent research has challenged this notion (Black and Creel 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). Johnson and
Goode (1994) discuss the role of burned rock middens in relation to acorn processing.
Burials related to the Late Archaic in Central and South Texas suggests the region saw an increase in
population. This increase may have prompted the establishment of territorial boundaries which resulted
in boundary disputes (Story 1985). Human remains dating to this sub-period have been encountered
near the Edward’s Plateau.
Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric period begins ca. 1200 BP (Collins 1995; Collins 2004), and appears to continue until
the Protohistoric Period (ca. A.D. 1700). A series of traits characterize the shift from the Archaic to the
Late Prehistoric Period. The main technological changes were the adoption of the bow and arrow and
the introduction of pottery. The Late Prehistoric Period is divided into two phases: The Austin phase and
the Toyah phase.
At the beginning of this period, environmental conditions were warmer and dryer. However, moister
conditions appear after 1000 B.P. (Mauldin and Nickels 2001). Plant and faunal remains at Late
Prehistoric sites indicate that subsistence practices are similar to that of the Late Archaic. Projectile
points associated with the Austin Phase include the Scallorn and Edwards types. The Toyah Phase is
characterized by the prominence of the Perdiz point (Collins 1995).
Most researchers concur that the early portion of the Late Prehistoric period saw a decrease in
population density (Black 1989:32). Radiocarbon dates from some sites have indicated that the middens
were used during the Late Prehistoric. Some archaeologists feel the peak popularity of midden use was
after A.D. 1 and into the Late Prehistoric (Black and Creel 1997:273). Radiocarbon dates from Camp
?owie middens provide evidence that supports ?lack and ?reel’s arguments that burned rock middens
were a primarily Late Prehistoric occurrence (Mauldin et al. 2003).
A shift in technology occurred around 650 B.P. This shift is characterized by the introduction of blade
technology, the first ceramics in Central Texas (bone-tempered plainwares), the appearance of Perdiz
arrow points, and alternately beveled bifaces (Black 1989:32; Huebner 1991:346). Prewitt (1981)

11

suggests this technology originated in north-central Texas. Patterson (1988), however, notes that the
Perdiz point was first seen in southeast Texas by about 1350 BP, and was introduced to west Texas some
600 to 700 years later.
Early ceramics in Central Texas (ca. A.D. 1250 to 1300) are associated with the Toyah Phase of the Late
Prehistoric and are referred to as Leon Plain ware. The Leon Plain ceramic types are undecorated, bonetempered bowls, jars, and ollas with oxidized, burnished and floated exterior surfaces (Ricklis 1995).
There is notable variation within the type (Black 1986; Johnson 1994; Kalter et al. 2005). This variation
can be attributed to differences in manufacturing techniques and cultural affiliation. Analysis of residues
on ceramic sherds suggests that vessels were used to process bison bone grease/fat, mesquite
bean/bison bone grease and deer/bison bone grease (Quigg et al. 1993).
The return of bison to South and Central Texas during the Late Prehistoric resulted from a drier climate
in the plains located to the north of Texas and increased grasses in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak
Savannah in north-central Texas (Huebner 1991). The increased grasses in the two biotas formed the
“bison corridor” along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau and into the South Texas Plain (Huebner
1991:354-355). Rock shelter sites, such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and
Classen Rock Shelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967), have indicated a shift in settlement
strategies (Skinner 1981). Burials encountered that dated to this period often reveal evidence of conflict
(Black 1989:32).
Historic Period
The beginnings of San Antonio, came about with the establishment of Mission San Antonio de Valero in
1718. Fray Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares had briefly visited the site several years prior, and
petitioned to set up a mission at the headwaters of the San Antonio River to act as a waypoint in the
journey to East Texas. The Marques de Valero, Viceroy of New Spain, granted Olivares’ request and
granted him permission (de la Teja 1995). Mission Valero occupied at least two locations before it
settled into its current spot. The final location was in use by 1724.
Five days after Mission Valero was founded, Presidio de Bexar was established. The presidio was to
house the Spanish soldiers who had come along with the expedition to found the Mission. Typically, the
families that followed the soldiers lived just outside the presidio.

12

Two years later, in 1720, Mission San José y San Miguel de Aguayo was established on the opposite bank
of the San Antonio River, to the south of Mission Valero and Presidio San Antonio de Bexar. This mission
was established to help serve native groups not wanting to reside at Mission Valero as they were not on
friendly terms with groups already living there. The original location of Mission San José was along the
east bank of the San Antonio River, approximately three leagues from Mission Valero. The mission was
then moved to the opposite bank sometime between 1724 and 1729, and relocated to its present site
during the 1740s due to an epidemic (Scurlock et al. 1976:222).
In 1722, just two years after Mission San José was founded, Mission San Francisco Xavier de Nàjera was
established. The mission was to serve a group of fifty Ervipiami families that came from the Brazos River
area (Schuetz 1968:11). Mission San Francisco Xavier de Nàjera was located near or on the present site
of Mission Concepción. The mission was unsuccessful due to a lack of funding. An attempt was made to
make the mission a sub-mission of Valero, but this failed as well (Habig 1968:78-81). Its doors closed in
1726 (Schuetz 1968:11). Ivey (1984:13) argued that the closure of the mission was due to the natives’
lack of interest in entering mission life.
Within the next few years, four other missions were established within the San Antonio area. The
remaining three missions were established in San Antonio within weeks of each other in 1731. These
three missions, Mission Nuestra Señora de la Purisima Concepción, Mission San Juan de Capistrano, and
Mission San Francisco de la Espada, were originally missions established in east Texas. Instead of being
reestablished near their original locations, they instead were removed to San Antonio.
In addition to the five missions, a civilian community, Villa San Fernando de Bexar, was established by
the Canary Islanders. Prior to the establishment of Villa San Fernando, Villa de Bexar had been settled by
30 presidial soldiers, seven of whom were married and brought their families. No formal titles were
issued to soldiers and their families as the property was distributed. Therefore, if a family occupied a
property, they likely did not own it (de la Teja 1995). Prior to 1731, soldiers and settlers were issued
licenses to build houses on and farm the land surrounding the garrison. The area was considered the
royal property of the presidio (Ivey 2008).
Archival research indicates that upon arrival, the Canary Islanders immediately took over the land
surrounding the garrison. This land was used as pasture and was originally property of Mission Valero.
As there was a lack of cleared agricultural land at the time, Captain Juan Antonio Pérez de Almazán

13

allowed the Canary Islanders use of the property (de la Teja 1995). The initial plan was for additional
Canary Island settlers to be sent to San Antonio after the first group was established. Due to high costs
to the Spanish Crown, no more groups were brought to Texas. This spurred the Canary Islanders
(Isleños) to launch a formal complaint against Mission Valero. This complaint paved the way for the
establishment of a civilian villa, San Fernando de Bexar, with a civilian church. The arrival of the Isleños
resulted in the first clearly defined civilian settlement in San Antonio.
During the early years of the Villa de Bexar and San Fernando de Bexar, the property that was granted to
the Isleños after 1745 and the settlers changed hands several times. The Isleños requested more
property in the Labores, and attempted to hinder others from obtaining any more land. Though their
efforts were not entirely successful, they did slow the amount of property given to the settlers (de la
Teja 1995). As grants were passed out, it appears that the Isleños would sell their original grants to
incoming settlers, or current non-Isleño inhabitants, then request an additional grant from the
government. By the 1800s, seven families had control of approximately half of the suertes that had been
distributed during the mid- to-late 1700s (de la Teja 1995).

Historical Background of the Project Area
A portion of the Acequia Madre de Valero is presently visible inside of the former Playland Park
property. A portion of the acequia channel is located in the northeastern quadrant of the property. It
currently acts as drainage for surface water washed in from Cunningham Avenue and Fort Sam during
times of rain. The acequia’s method of construction and its dimensions have never been properly
examined in the southern portion of the property boundaries. In addition, as indicated, the precise
route of the acequia across the southern portion of the property, where it is buried by fill, is not well
known. Nonetheless, the route of the irrigation ditch is critical both to the placement of facilities and
buildings on the tract as well as the accurate interpretive layout associated with the feature.
Acequia Madre de Valero
The Acequia Madre de Valero (also referred to as Acequia del Alamo or Alamo ditch) was the first
irrigation canal excavated by the Spanish colonists in the upper San Antonio River drainage. The
construction of the feature started in January of 1719 in order to bring water to the fields of Mission San
Antonio de Valero. The irrigation ditch began at a diversion dam at the San Antonio River, located just
north of the former Pioneer Hall, located at the Witte Museum. Water was diverted to the east crossing
the bank just south of the large Cypress trees still standing on the property. Tomka indicates that a plot

14

of the route of the Acequia Madre del Alamo on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the upper San
Antonio River valley shows that the acequia’s route along the eastern margin of the river valley closely
follows the 680 foot contour line (Tomka, Personal Communication 2017). The acequia extended to the
Mission San Antonio de Valero complex, and continued south to a re-entry point on the river.
Historic deed records and maps of the project area show how the property has changed hands and land
uses after the Spanish Colonial Period. The project area appears on the 1886 ?ird’s Eye View of San
Antonio by Augustus Koch (Figure 2-1). The map depicts a branch in the acequia west of the project area
and north of Josephine Street. The eastern branch crosses River Avenue into the project area and then
curves to the south to exit the property at Grayson Street. The acequia passes by several buildings
within the project area, including a two-story structure with wrap-around porches.

16

The deed records trace the ownership of the property back to 1847, at which time James Trueheart
appears to have purchased a large portion of property from his father-in-law, Jose Antonio de la Garza.
The property boundaries extended west to the San Antonio River and a desague of the acequia, east to
the Acequia Madre del Alamo. The property was bound on the north by land owned by de la Garza, and
on the south by property owned by the heirs of Manuel Ximenes (BCDR O1:65). It appears that the twostory structure with wrap-around porches was most likely built by Trueheart, as it appears on the ?ird’s
Eye View map in 1886. Margarita de la Garza Trueheart conveyed the property to her brother, Leonardo
Garza, in 1888 (BCDR 39:503). The deed references the fact that the property was part of the Trueheart
and Garza Addition as surveyed by the City Engineer in September of 1880. It appears that there were
several transactions between Margarita Trueheart and Leonardo Garza. A transaction between
Leonardo and Margarita in 1890 indicated that Margarita was selling off lots to the west of River
Avenue, some going to her brother (BCDR 138:661). By the 1890s, Leonardo had many properties in San
Antonio, and likely was in the real estate business, and was living at a house on River Avenue, rather
than the dwelling that was once located in the project area.
By 1899, a judgment was issued against Garza and company for not paying bank held notes on his
property holdings (BCDR 5:312). As a result, Garza conveyed his properties, including the current project
area, to F. and Hulda Groos (BCDR 177:565). F. Groos and Company was a firm composed of Hulda,
Gustav, and Carl Wilhelm August Groos (York 2016). F. Groos and Company later became Groos National
Bank.
Hulda Groos conveyed the property to Paul Poppe in August of 1905 (BCDR 265:19). This transaction
retained the vendor’s lien on the property and improvements until the interest on the note was paid in
full. The project area can be seen on the 1912 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map (Figure 2-2). At the time the
map was drawn, the two-story structure was present south of Appler and the Poppe Nursery building.
Much of what was present on the 1886 ?ird’s Eye View south of the two-story structure was no longer
standing in 1912. It appears that Poppe took an extension on notes on the property in 1913, with the
intention of paying them off in 1916 and 1917 (BCDR 428:329).

17

Figure 2-2. The APE as seen on the 1912 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map.
In 1941, deed records indicate that an easement was established to allow the storm and flood waters to
flow from the property (BCDR 1839:21). It appears that at this time, some of the improvements to the
acequia channel may have occurred.
The development of the property into Playland Park began during the winter of 1942 (Gaida 2007). The

18

records indicate that Jimmy Johnson leased the property for the park while it was still being used as the
plant nursery. Thus, a few buildings associated with Poppe’s nursery survived into the 1940s. Johnson
initially kept some of the buildings, including the steam plant that kept the greenhouses (Gaida 2007).
In 1943, Johnson opened the boilers in the basement of the steam plant, filled them with sand, and then
filled the area with concrete to form a new foundation (Gaida 2007). The nursery office, a wooden
building, was converted to Playland Park’s operation center. Johnson had an office and warehouse
constructed at the rear of the park (Gaida 2007). Appler Street had already been closed when Johnson
leased the property. He had the area to the south of the old Appler Street paved for parking. Appler
Street was located north of the two-story house present on the 1886 ?ird’s Eye View map and 1912
Sanborn Fire Insurance Map (Figures 2-1 and 2-2). Since the presence of the house was not discussed in
the construction plans of Playland Park, it can be inferred that the house was no longer standing by
1942.
Playland Park was in operation until September 1, 1980 (Gaida 2007). Although there were a few
attractions that remained throughout the Park’s existence (i.e. roller coaster, carousel), Jimmy Johnson
worked to improve the property with new rides, attractions and modifications to accommodate and
attract visitors over the years.
Historic aerial photographs of the project area indicate that the route of the acequia was still visible in
1938 (Figure 2-3). By this time, the acequia route appears to have acted as drainage for the area. The
aerial shows that the project area was relatively undeveloped in 1938. To the east of the APE, some
development is noted that relates to the use of the area by Fort Sam Houston. A cleared area, in the
approximate location of the two-story house is visible in the aerial photograph. The absence of the
house indicates that it was demolished sometime between 1912 and 1938.

19

Figure 2-3. The 1938 aerial showing the acequia route lined by trees.

20

By 1959, the aerial photograph indicates that portions of Playland Park had been constructed. The park
officially opened in 1942, but continued to expand over the next couple decades. The tree line that had
demarcated the route of the acequia is obscured on the 1959 aerial (Figure 2-2). The southern portion
of the APE was cleared, and potentially graded in preparation for Playland additions and parking lot.

Figure 2-4. The 1959 aerial of the area, after the construction of Playland Park.

21

Further development of the property occurred between 1959 and 1966, as seen in the aerial
photograph. The route of the acequia across the southern half of the APE is no longer visible (Figure 25). The area where the acequia should flow was cleared, graded, and appears to have been asphalted or
covered with a caliche base.

22

By 1977, the southern portion of the APE was used as a parking lot. The aerial shows that the acequia
route is not visible, and is likely covered with caliche road base to provide a level surface (Figure 2-6).

Previous Archaeology
Previously completed surveys within and in the vicinity of the APE are identified in Figure 2-7. One
previous archaeological survey has been conducted within the project area. The survey was conducted
in 2008 by the Center for Archaeological Research at UTSA (CAR-UTSA). The investigation consisted of
pedestrian survey and shovel testing. No significant finds were uncovered during the course of the
survey. UTSA-CAR noted that northern portion of the property is bounded by a drainage that follows the
route of the Acequia Madre de Valero (41BX8). UTSA-CAR recommended that the proposed Alamo
Community College developments proceed as planned, although the route of the acequia needed to be
avoided (Meissner 2009).
Located within a ¼ mile radius of the current APE, one site was recorded and five previous
archaeological surveys have been conducted. Two National Register Districts also are found within the
radius: Brackenridge Park and Fort Sam Houston. Site 41BX1899 was recorded during the Butterkrust
Building/Brackenridge Trail 11 Survey conducted in 2011 by UTSA-CAR. The site consisted of five
unmodified flakes, one retouched flake, and one core recovered in two backhoe trenches. Due to its
proximity to Paleoindian deposits, this site was determined to have potential for producing significant
deposits (THC 2016).
In 1976, Anne Fox and S. Katz conducted a survey along the San Antonio River to document cultural
resources in Brackenridge Park. Although the survey encountered many significant historic and
prehistoric resources, none were located within the ¼ mile radius of the current APE. Another
pedestrian survey of the Brackenridge Golf Course was conducted in 2008 by SWCA. No significant finds
were encountered within the ¼ mile radius of the current APE, although site 41BX1396 is located just to
the north (THC 2016).
In 1978, the Army Corps of Engineer-Fort Worth District conducted a pedestrian survey of Fort Sam
Houston. Although no sites were recorded during the survey, the information gathered helped to
support the nomination of Fort Sam to the National Register of Historic Places. Fort Sam was placed on
the register in 1975.

Chapter 3: Methods of Investigation
Field Methods
Preceding the survey, archival research was carried out in order to compile and compare the various
distinct routes of the acequia feature, as depicted in historical documents. After this assessment was
completed, archaeological investigations of the project area were conducted, and included a ground
penetrating radar (GPR) survey and archaeological backhoe trenching. This method was employed in
order to identify the route of the buried portion of the acequia within the property boundary. The
project area was also inspected (via reconnaissance) by RKEI to determine if any significant structures or
features were visible on the surface within the APE, although the scope of work called for the
investigations to focus on the rediscovery of the route of the Acequia Madre del Alamo in the southern
portion of the property. The visible portion of the acequia/drainage ditch in the northern portion of the
property was inspected to aid in the placement of the grid for the ground penetrating radar survey in
the southern half. Based on the results of the archival research and site reconnaissance, a rectangular
area measuring 55 X 80 meters was identified containing the five distinct possible routes of the acequia.

Ground Penetrating Radar
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a non-destructive method of geophysical inspection that uses radar
pulses to image the subsurface. It utilizes electromagnetic radiation produced by a surface antenna. The
antenna emits pulses of radar energy, creating waves of varying wavelengths that pass through the
ground. The waves spread as they pass through the ground, creating a cone shape in relation to the
properties of the subsurface materials (Conyers 2016). As the waves pass through the ground, they are
reflected back to the transmitter as they come in contact with the buried features or changes in soil
stratigraphy. The travel time of the waves is measured by the receiver. Only reflected radar waves are
recorded by the receiver, as some waves extend deeper below the surface before eventually dissipating.
The velocity of the waves slows as they move through the ground. Waves that return at an angle not
aligned with the receiver or slower than the receiver can read are not recorded, making those
subsurface features invisible, and therefore not included in data interpretation (Conyers 2016).
The type GPR antenna employed determines the depth of penetration of the radar waves. Lower
frequency antenna result in deeper penetration, whereas higher frequency reaches shallower depths. In
contrast, lower frequency antenna produce coarser resolution, while a higher frequency antenna will

26

produce a finer image (GSSI 2016).
Dielectric properties of the materials encountered by the waves result in different reflections of the
wavelengths. The reflections returned to the antenna are displayed on a video monitor as a continuous
cross-section in real time. The Relative Dielectric Permittivity (RDP) of water is 81, whereas concrete is
6.25. A low-to-high change in RDP produces a reflection in-phase with the transmitted waveform. A
high-to-low change in the RDP produces a reflection phased-flipped with the transmitted waveform. The
directionality displayed in the data contrast determines the phase of the reflection (GSSI 2016).
Performance limitation is most significant in high-conductivity materials such as clay soils and soils that
are salt contaminated. Performance is also hampered by signal scattering in heterogeneous conditions
(e.g. rocky soils). The signals are read in units of time, but can be converted to depth measurement in
the control unit. The general consensus is that the depth displayed for signal reflections has a 15 to 20
percent margin of error (GSSI 2016). For the purposes of this project scanning was performed using a
GSSI SIR-4000 GPR controller with an internal hard drive and a color display, and a 400 mega-Hertz
(MHz) antenna. A 400 MHz antenna is the typical antenna used for archaeological investigations as it
reaches depth of up to 3.5 meters below the surface. The area surveyed was a 55-X-80 meter grid. The
grid was divided into transects spaced approximately 1 meter apart. The data was collected via the “zig­
zag” method. Each transect was identified as a “line” and numbered sequentially within each grid.
RADAN 7 was used to extrapolate the data and run the models to produce 3-D images, as well as
attempt to define anomalies noted on the individual line scans. Each grid was processed using the
processing steps that included moving the data to an effective time zero, removing background,
applying minimal filters, and plotting the signal floor. The signal floor is the estimate of the effective
depth of each scan based on the analysis of the signal noise to signal loss. In some cases, though, a
reflector can still be located beneath the signal floor if they are strong enough. The extrapolated data
was examined to view the signal strata and identify anomalies.

Backhoe Trenching
Backhoe trenches (BHTs) were excavated once the initial visual inspection of the project area and the
GPR survey was completed.

The number of backhoe trenches was determined by the Project

Archaeologist based on the results of the GPR survey and archival research. The backhoe trenches aimed
at ground-truthing the main anomaly, as well as investigating the area that had the highest density of

27

acequia route projections.
The trenches ranged from 8 to 20 meters in length and were approximately 1-meter wide to allow ease
of access. They did not exceed 1.5 meters in depth. Typical archaeological backhoe trenching first
excavates trenches to the depth of 1.5 meters below the surface following OHSA regulated safety
standards. If the trenches needed to exceed a depth of 1.5 meters below the surface, archaeologists
would have appropriately benched the trenches to allow for safe ingress and egress. Within the project
boundaries, the water table was encountered between 1 meter and 1.5 meters below the surface. The
presence of groundwater hindered further excavations. The documentation of the trenches consisted of
clearing a representative segment of each trench wall for careful scrutiny. The cleared wall was
photographed with a scale, and a detailed profile drawing was made of the soil strata observed. Any
artifacts noted in the representative trench wall segment were to be shown on the profile.

Laboratory Methods
Artifacts identified in backhoe trench walls were drawn in situ and photo-documented, but were not
collected. Artifacts that were observed within the backdirt were noted and documented on the backhoe
trench forms. These items were reburied when the trenches were backfilled. No diagnostic materials
were encountered.
All project related documentation produced during the survey was prepared in accordance with federal
regulation 36 CFR Part 79, and THC requirements for State Held-in-Trust collections. Field notes, field
forms, photographs, and field drawings were placed into labeled archival folders and converted into
electronic files. Digital photographs were printed on acid-free paper, labeled with archivally appropriate
materials, and were placed in archival-quality plastic sleeves when needed. All field forms were
completed with pencil. Ink-jet produced maps and illustrations were placed in archival quality plastic
page protectors to prevent against accidental smearing due to moisture. A copy of the report and all
digital materials were saved onto a CD and stored with field notes and documents. All project related
documentation is permanently housed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.

Chapter 4: Results of Investigations
Over the course of four days in October, RKEI conducted archaeological investigations within the
Playland Park property, the proposed site of the Alamo Community College District Support Operations
Building.

The first two days of investigations consisted of the reconnaissance and the Ground

Penetrating Radar survey. The remaining days focused on the excavation of backhoe trenches in an
effort to re-expose the route of the Acequia Madre de Valero (acequia). With the exception of the
reconnaissance, the field investigations focused on the area of the potentially buried acequia channel.

Archival Research
Prior to the field investigations, the project historian conducted archival research to gather information
related to the former land use and occupation history of the tract and the routes of the acequia as they
were depicted on various historic maps. Below the results of this research area summarized beginning
with the acequia routes.
To aid the search for the acequia, RKEI compiled several historic maps that depicted the route of the
acequia. The earliest depiction of the acequia appears on the map of the San Antonio missions and
presidio dating to 1764. The map provides an idea of the spatial relationships between missions, the
Presidio, major rivers, and other important features on the landscape (Menchaca 1764). Select maps
were consulted to locate the acequia route, and these maps indicated that the route in the southern
portion of the APE has varied. Rullman created a map depicting San Antonio de Bexar in 1836. On this
map, the acequia crosses the property diagonally, and does not appear to follow the current route of
the ditch in the northeastern portion of the APE. A second depiction of the acequia appears on the 1852
Plat of the City Tract of San Antonio de Bexar map (Figure 4-1). The 1889 City Engineers Map depicts the
route of the acequia to the east of the concentration of the other projections (Figure 4-1). The 1909 City
Engineers Map shows a few deviations, but appears to follow a portion of the Rullman alignment. The
1912 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map veers slightly to the west in the northern section of the APE, but
appears to be located in close proximity to the Rullman and 1909 routes. The 1916 City Surveyor Map
places the acequia route slightly to the west, although there is some overlap in the northern portion of
the APE. The 1938 historic aerial appears to depict the acequia route the furthest west, in comparison to
the map projections. I.W. Cox, based on years of documentary research, compiled a relatively
comprehensive map of the routes of the different acequia systems associated with each of the San

29

Antonio missions. The City digitized ?ox’s routes and a comparison of the ?ity’s projection with those
based on the aforementioned historic maps results in strong correspondence among the various
sources. Since the main goal of the archival research was to pinpoint the most likely location where
excavations would uncover the acequia, using the data obtained, we defined a 55-x-80 meter rectangle
that would encompass all of the projections of the route. The GPR survey focused on this area (Figure 41).

30

Figure 4-1. The projected routes of the Acequia Madre de Valero gathered from historic maps.

31

To reconstruct the land use and ownership history of the property, the project historian relied on the
available Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps. The 1912 Texas Sanborn Fire Insurance Map depicts the APE
starting slightly north of Appler Street and extending south to E. Josephine Street (Figure 4-2). The route
of the acequia served as the property boundary, separating the Fort Sam Houston tract from the
privately held property. Two large buildings appear along the east side of the acequia just north of
Hamilton Street on Fort Sam Houston property. These buildings are labeled “Ft. Sam Houston Ice Plant &
Wood Yard”. There is one large building and a few smaller buildings located within the APE on the
western side of the acequia. The large building just north of Appler Street and is labeled “Paul Poppe
Nursery”. Several other buildings are located south of Appler Street, but only one of them is labeled as
“storage” (Figure 4-2). A large, two-story structure located south of Appler Street appears to have been
built prior to 1886. It appears on the 1886 ?ird’s Eye View of San Antonio by Augustus Koch. Deed
records do not indicate its date of construction, but it is likely related to the de la Garza and Trueheart
occupation of the property, which dates back to 1847 (BCDR O1:65). The structure on the 1912 Sanborn
Fire Insurance Map indicates that the building was constructed of wood and stone.
When Jimmy Johnson first acquired the land to build Playland Park in 1942, a plant nursery and
supporting buildings were noted on the property (Gaida 2007:31). This nursery was most likely the “Paul
Poppe Nursery” building just north of Appler Street. According to the Bexar County Deed Records
(BCDR), the southern portion of the APE where the unknown buildings were located was sold by the
Bexar County Sheriff under a court order from the 45th District Court of Bexar County in January 1899 to
Leonardo Garza, the San Antonio National Bank and 10 other names (BCDR 177, pp. 565-568). The
property was then sold on March 17, 1945 from six heirs of Leonardo Garza to M. Riley Wyatt, who in
turn sold the property to James E. Johnson on September 25, 1946 (BCDR 177, pp. 565-568). The deed
records do not contain any information pertaining to the construction or expansion of the buildings in
this southern portion of the APE. Therefore, it is unclear if the buildings noted south of Appler St. in
Figure 4-2 were still standing when Johnson took over the property. The review of the historic aerials
earlier in this report suggests that the structure was demolished by 1938, as it does not appear on the
aerial. In addition, there are no direct references to the presence of the acequia within the property.

32

Figure 4-2. The 1912 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map depicting a portion of the current APE.
The next series of Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps of the vicinity of the APE appear to have been drafted
circa 1951, after the establishment of Playland Park (Figure 4-3). The 1951 version depicts the entire
property. Two structures were noted along the route of the acequia, which acted as the property
boundary. One of the structures is located within the Fort Sam Houston property. The other appears to

33

be a small structure in the northern portion of Playland Park. The buildings noted in the southern
portion of the 1912 Sanborn map are no longer on site. The two-story structure was not present at the
time of the map.

Pedestrian Reconnaissance
Prior to the inception of the Ground Penetrating Radar Survey, the staff completed a 100 percent
reconnaissance of the tract in search of signs of foundations, and other features that would have
remained following the abandonment of Playland Park. Pockets of dense trees and foliage are present
along the route of the Acequia Madre de Valero which is currently used as drainage (Figure 4-4). The
concrete retaining wall supporting the drainage exhibits modern graffiti in areas. The deed records make
no direct reference to the construction of the retaining wall, although discussion of the drainage
appears in documentation dating to 1941. In addition, Gaida (2007) reported that Johnson struggled
with flooding within the park property, which may mean that retaining walls and water diversions were
constructed during Johnson’s occupation.

Figure 4-4. Retaining wall located on the south side of the drainage.
Areas of concrete rubble, associated with demolished Playland Park structures, were noted on the
surface (Figure 4-5). In addition, it appears that the area has been used by the homeless as clothing,

35

bedding, and recent trash were noted within the APE in wooded areas. In the northern portion of the
APE, south of the retaining walls and along the old route of the acequia, an area was noted that
exhibited two concrete slabs that appeared to be connected by asphalted walkways (Figure 4-6).
Adjacent to one of these slabs was an electrical pole that had a string of cables still present (Figure 4-7).

Ground Penetrating Radar Surveys
A 55-X-80 meter GPR grid was laid out across the southern portion of the APE and was designed to
intersect the different routes of the acequia documented on the historic maps. The data collector did
not identify any significant anomalies on the display while viewed in the field. The data was then
returned to the RKEI Archaeological Laboratory for post-processing using the RADAN 7 software. The
data compiled into a 3-D model was processed. The signal floor was estimated to be approximately 1 to
1.5 meters below the surface.
Post-collection data processing revealed an anomaly that appeared to be located in the vicinity of the
acequia route depicted on several historic maps (Figure 4-8). The anomaly formed a curve from the
north edge of the GPR grid toward the west edge of the grid. The anomaly was approximately 7 meters
in width. An additional anomaly noted in the southwestern corner of the grid appears to be related to
compacted road base, possibly related to the area’s use as a parking lot.
The GPR anomaly does not appear to match the acequia projections. At the time the data was
processed, this did not seem to be an issue as the 1938 historic aerial shows an acequia route that
appeared to differ from the historic map projections of the route. Excavation of the backhoe trenches
revealed that the GPR anomaly was not consistent with the location of the remnants of the acequia. It is
likely that the GPR signal reading was affected by the presence of groundwater near the surface. As
groundwater was encountered in backhoe trenches between 1 to 1.5 meters below the surface, it is
likely that the anomaly is related to the flow of groundwater.

39

Backhoe Trenching
To define the nature of the anomaly identified in the northwest corner of the survey grid, RKEI staff
directed the mechanical excavation of several backhoe trenches across the survey area. Specifically, four
backhoe trenches were excavated to search for the acequia (Figure 4-9). To investigate the nature of the
anomaly, BHT 1 was excavated at the northern edge of the GPR survey area. BHT 2 was excavated on
the western edge of the GPR survey grid to determine if the anomaly turns towards the west as the GPR
data suggested. BHT 3 was excavated perpendicular to BHT 2 to determine if the anomaly was oriented
north-south, rather than east-west. Finally, BHT 4 was excavated approximately 10 meters to the south
of BHT 2 to determine if any of the acequia projections were correct. Six of the seven acequia
projections were investigated via backhoe trenching. The 1889 Engineers Map placed the acequia route
to the east of the others, and therefore was treated as an outlier. It is likely that the depiction of the
route in 1889 may not be represented accurately, and does not fall near the COSA digitization of the
routes in the southern portion of the property based on research compiled by I.Waynne Cox.

Figure 4-9. Locations of the Backhoe Trenches GPR Grid/APE.

Backhoe Trench 1
Backhoe Trench 1 was located along the north edge of the GPR grid (Figure 4-10) and was oriented
approximately east-west. The trench was started in the center of the GPR anomaly and was excavated
to the west. To begin, a 7-meter segment of the trench was excavated to the west of the approximate
mid-line of the anomaly and the walls were inspected for stratigraphic indicators and cultural material

41

evidence of the acequia. Having found no indication of the acequia, trenching resumed with the
backhoe excavating from the midline of the anomaly going east. The final dimensions of BHT 1 were 13
meters in length, 1.2 meters in depth, and approximately 1 meter in width. Once the trench reached a
depth of 1.2 meters below the surface, ground water began seeping in and pooling at the bottom
toward the eastern end of the trench. It was partially backfilled to allow for the RKEI archaeologists to
enter the trench to clean and profile the walls.
Upon close examination, the trench walls revealed five distinct strata. The upper 10 to 20 cm of matrix
consisted of fine, silty sand with some limestone gravels. The light tan matrix represents caliche that
was used to create a parking lot for Playland Park. Below the light tan soil, the matrix was a brown
(10YR3/1) silty clay zone that contained rusted metal fragments and some gravels. A thin layer of light
brown to yellowish (10YR6/4) silty clay demarcated the slopes of the irrigation ditch (Figure 4-10).
Below the light brown matrix, under the slopes of the ditch the soil became Houston Black clay that
exhibited less than 10% gravels. At the base of the trench, heavy gravels were noted in the Houston
Black clay.

The trench profiles exhibited soil stratigraphy consistent with an acequia (Figure 4-11). The matrix
observed in Zone 2 appears to have been deposited once the section of the acequia was covered over.
Zone 3 is consistent with silty soils typically cleared out of the acequia trench during its use. The acequia
would have been excavated into the natural clay substratum (Zone 4). The base of the trench consisted
of a heavy gravel lens (Zone 5) that extended past the limits of the BHT.

Figure 4-11. The north wall profile of BHT 1.
Artifacts were encountered within Zone 2 of the acequia channel. Unidentified rusted, ferrous metal
fragments were common. It is likely that a few fragments were nails as they appeared to be similar in
shape. Due to the rusting on the metal, it was not possible to definitively identify the artifacts. A few
fragments of brown glass, and a fragment of cut bone were also observed.

Backhoe Trench 2
BHT 2 was located on the western edge of the GPR grid, crossing the anomaly observed in the GPR data
(Figure 4-8). The trench was oriented north-south, and was approximately 12 meters in length. BHT 2
was excavated to 1.5 meters below the surface, but had to be backfilled to 1.2mbs to cover the bottom
of the trench which was saturated with water. The final depth of the trench was 1.2 meters below the
surface.
BHT 2 exhibited some similarities to BHT 1, but lacked clear evidence of an acequia trench. The upper 20
cm consisted of the same very pale brown (10YR7/3) silty sand with some gravels that was observed in
BHT 1 (Figure 4-12). Underlying the silty sand, was Houston Black clay (10YR2/1) with little to no gravels.

43

The Houston Black was approximately 90-100 cm in thickness. The base of the trench consisted of
Houston Black clay with gravel. No artifacts were noted within BHT.

Figure 4-12. Section of the west wall of BHT 2.

Backhoe Trench 3
BHT 3 was excavated perpendicular to BHT 2 and was oriented east-west (Figure 4-8). Since no evidence
of the acequia was noted in BHT 2, it was surmised that the acequia route was located to the east of
BHT 2. BHT 3 was approximately 10 meters in length, and was first excavated to a maximum depth of 1.5
meters below the surface. Subsequently, the trench was backfilled to a depth of 1.2 meters as ground
water began seeping into the trench.
The stratigraphy of BHT 3 was nearly identical to that of BHT 2 (Figure 4-13). The upper 15 cm consisted
of the very pale brown (10YR7/3) silty sand with approximately 40% gravels. Below the silty sand, BHT 3
exhibited the Houston Black clay (10YR3/1). Few gravels were noted in this zone. At the base of the
trench, the gravels increased in size and density. The Houston Black clay extended to approximately 1.25
meters below the surface.

44

Figure 4-13. North wall of BHT 3.
No artifacts were noted during the excavation or the walls of BHT 3. In addition, no evidence of the
acequia was observed in the trench.

Backhoe Trench 4
BHT 4 was excavated south of BHTs 2 and 3 (Figure 4-8). BHT 4 crossed four projected routes of the
acequia according to historic maps. The trench was approximately 18 meters long, 90 cm wide, and
extended to a depth of 1.5 meters below the surface.
The upper strata consisted of a layer of road base that was approximately 10 to 15 cm in thickness.
Cleaning of the trench walls did not reveal an obvious outline of the acequia channel. Rather, sections of
the trench wall exhibited the lighter clay and gravel lens (Figure 4-14) that was present in BHT 1 and
defined the edges of the acequia. The lens was not encountered in BHTs 2 or 3. In BHT 4, the lens is not
continuous across the entire profile; rather it appears in two sections approximately 15 to 20 cm below

45

the surface. The lens and matrix just above the lens contains cultural material, similar to that
encountered in BHT 1. While there is no defined outline of the acequia channel, it appears that the
matrix encountered in BHT 4 is consistent with that observed in BHT 1.

Figure 4-14. North wall of BHT 4. Note the light zone within the black clay.
A few artifacts were noted during the excavation of BHT 4, including a rusted metal hinge, a fragment of
saw-cut cow bone, a ferrous chain link, and an olive glass bottle lip (Figure 4-15). Examination of the
glass fragment revealed that it was an applied lip which was a typical manufacturing technique used
until the early 1900s (Kendrick 1966). The presence of cultural materials in the clay matrix is consistent
with the findings in BHT 1 where a clear outline of the irrigation ditch is clearly visible. Therefore, we
interpret the clay layer at the base of BHT 4 as representing silty fill deposited in the acequia channel.

Chapter 5: Summary and Recommendations
Historic maps and aerials were consulted to locate the Acequia Madre de Valero (acequia). Each historic
map placed the acequia route at slightly different locations within the project area. The locations of the
acequia projections were overlaid on a current aerial to aid in placement of the backhoe trenches. Six of
the seven projections were investigated as part of this project. The location of the Ground Penetrating
Radar (GPR) anomaly was loaded into a handheld GPS unit to aid the positioning of the backhoe
trenches. Four backhoe trenches were excavated in search of the acequia.
RKEI conducted archaeological investigations of the future location of the Alamo Community Colleges
District Support Operations Building. The goal of the investigations was to re-discover the route of the
acequia that historically traversed the property. A GPR survey was conducted to locate anomalies that
were potentially associated with the route. The GPR survey covered an area measuring 55-x-80 meters.
The survey was conducted along transects spaced at 1-meter intervals. Post-processing of the data was
done using the RADAN 7 software. The processed data revealed an anomaly in the northwestern
quadrant of the GPR grid that appeared as a curved channel. Although the curved channel did not match
the projections of the acequia from the historic maps, it was noted that it could be associated with the
route noted on the 1938 aerial. Subsequent excavations found that the curved anomaly was likely not
related to the acequia channel, although may have been influenced by the flow of the groundwater
table encountered within the project area.
BHT 1, located at the north end of the GPR grid, encountered evidence of the acequia channel just
below the road base. The channel appears to have been cut into the Houston Black Clay substrate. The
high water table within the APE prevented the base of the acequia from being uncovered. Although it
appears that the edged of the acequia channel extended approximately 7 meters across, the main
portion of the channel measured 3.5 meters. It appears that the bottom of the acequia channel was not
encountered do to encountering the water table at 1.2 meters below the surface. Artifacts, mostly
rusted metal, were encountered within the channel of the acequia. No other artifacts were noted
outside of the acequia channel.
BHT 2 was excavated along the western boundary of the GPR grid. The 1938 historic aerial depicted the
acequia route passing through this location, and the GPR anomaly also coincided with this area. The
trench did not contain evidence of an acequia trench. Rather, the stratigraphy consisted of road base

48

just below the surface, which was sitting atop Houston Black Clay. Gravel layers were noted below the
clay. No artifacts were encountered in the matrix exposed by BHT 2.
To determine if BHT 2 missed the acequia channel as depicted by the GPR anomaly, BHT 3 was
excavated perpendicular to BHT 2. The trench encountered similar soils as noted in BHT 2, and no
artifacts were observed in the exposed matrix. In addition, no evidence of an acequia channel was
revealed in the trench walls. BHTs 2 and 3 also encountered the water table at a slightly greater depth
than in BHT 1. During the documentation of BHTs 2 and 3, water pooled at the bases of the trenches.
BHT 4 was placed to intersect historic map projections of the acequia. The trench was to have crossed
four of the projections (COSA-OHP digital acequia projections; 1912 Rullman map depicting San Antonio
de Bexar in 1836; the 1909 City Engineers Map; and the 1912 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map). BHT 4
exhibited soils and stratigraphy that was similar to BHT 1, but without the outline of an acequia channel.
The upper layer of matrix consisted of road base. The light brown silty soil contained a few artifacts
including saw cut bone and rusted metal. In addition, a fragment of olive glass was encountered that
had an applied lip that dates to the manufacture to pre-1900s. Below the silty soil, the trench contained
Houston Black Clay. Near the base of the trench, the gravel density greatly increased.
Although there was no definitive acequia channel in BHT 4, the trench revealed a zone of matrix that is
associated with the acequia. A similar matrix zone was encountered in BHT 4 that was observed in BHT 4
which contained cultural material. This zone consisted of brown (10YR3/1) silty clay containing a rusted
metal, glass, and cut bone. It is likely that the acequia channel was truncated by the construction of the
parking lot. This would have reduced evidence of the banks of the acequia channel in BHT 4. In addition,
archival research and excavation of trenches to re-locate the Acequia Madre de Valero on the grounds
of the Witte Museum revealed that the route of the acequia channel has shifted over time (Ulrich 2011).
On the Witte grounds, two acequia channels were revealed that represented the original channel, and a
second channel that was dug after the first had been filled. The Ditch Commissioner Office was
abolished in 1899 (Frkuska 1981). Soon after, in 1901, Acequia Madre de Valero was ordered closed
(Barnes 1902; Ulrich 2011). In 1903, the need for storm drainage led to the reopening of the acequia.
The portion of the acequia located in Playland Park likely was subject to these changes. In addition, it
appears that this section was not fully closed in 1905 when the acequia was ordered to be abandoned
(Ulrich 2011). The appearance of the route of the acequia on the 1938 aerial indicates that the ditch
continued to be used for storm run-off into the mid-20th century. The southern portion of the acequia in

49

the project area was closed to allow for the construction of the parking lot (ca. 1960).
The composite picture that emerges from the historic maps and historic aerials is an acequia route that
constantly shifted over the general 200 years of use. In addition, the construction of Playland Park and
the 1960’s parking lot may have sheared off the top portion of the channel to create a level surface. This
suggests that only a lens of the base of the irrigation ditch would remain subsurface.
It is likely that the route of the acequia could have shifted either by natural or man-made means over
the course of its existence. This could explain why there are only pockets of the light brown silty soil
containing cultural materials rather than a defined channel.
Combining the results of the archival research and the backhoe trenching, it is possible to produce a
map depicting the route of the acequia through the property (Figure 5-1). The acequia was encountered
in both BHT-1, and BHT-4. The condition of the irrigation feature varied in the two BHTs, in part due to
modern impacts that appear to have sheared off the slopes of the ditch leaving only the clay bottom
with discarded artifacts in situ. At the southern edge of the APE, a drain is present on the north side of
E. Josephine Street. It is likely that the drain is continuation of the acequia. Historic and modern
drainage pipes and other utilities have been observed by the authors installed in the abandoned channel
of acequias throughout San Antonio. A modern storm drain running near historic buildings near the west
wall of the Alamo follows the route of the Acequia Madre de Valero quite closely. A storm draining
running the length of Alamo Plaza Street located on the interior of the west wall of the Alamo
Compound is aligned with a historic depiction of the acequia. A water line was noted within the stonelined channel of the San Pedro Acequia within the Arsenal Compound.

and results of the archaeological investigation.

RKEI encountered definitive evidence of the Acequia Madre de Valero in one of the four backhoe
trenches excavated during the course of the investigation. BHT 4 likely contains remnants of the
acequia as it is the only other trench that encountered a matrix zone containing cultural material that
was similar to the matrix noted within the acequia channel observed in BHT 1. The approximate route
of the acequia can be incorporated in the design of the proposed Alamo Community College District
Support Operations Building. The plan is to create an interpretive feature that does not impact the
remnants within the APE.

As long as the proposed designs will not impact the acequia, RKEI

recommends that the project can proceed as planned and does not warrant additional investigations.
Should the construction plans call for subsurface impacts in the vicinity of the acequia, RKEI
recommends that further work is necessary as well as coordination with the THC and COSA-OHP to
determine efforts to avoid destruction of the historic resource.

Appendix A: Truehart House Foundation (41BX2192)
On July 14, 2017, Raba Kistner Environmental, Inc. (RKEI) archaeologists were notified by Ford Powell &
Carson that a feature consisting of large limestone blocks was encountered during the excavation of the
future site of a foundation pad for the Alamo Community Colleges Support Operations Buildings.
Excavations in the area ceased. A RKEI archaeologist visited the site the next day to observe the feature.
With the information gathered from the site visit, the RKEI archaeologist notified the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and the City of San Antonio Office of Historic Preservation (COSA-OHP). COSA-OHP
recommended further excavations in the area to determine the extent of the feature.
The original antiquities permit was amended to include the exposure and documentation of the feature.
The feature was to be mechanically excavated, and then subsequently documented using a LEICA global
positioning system unit. Exposure and documentation occurred on July 19, 2017. Kristi Miller Nichols
was Project Archaeologist of these investigations and Chris Murray assisted in the exposure of the
feature.
Upon further inspection of the feature, it was determined that the stones were part of the Truehart
House foundation (41BX2192), which was likely constructed prior to 1886. The history of the property is
discussed in Chapter 2 of this report. Examination of the 1912 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map depicts the
building as comprised of a stone central portion, with a wooden wrap-around porch and wood frame
and brick eastern elevation. The house appears on the 1886 ?ird’s Eye View of San !ntonio as a twostory house with a wrap-around porch for the upper and lower elevations.
Initially, a portion of the foundation was exposed that appeared to be a possible corner (Figure A-1 and
Figure A-2). Several large limestone blocks that appeared to be lying haphazardly relative to the
foundation were identified. The intact portion of the foundation exhibited a chiseled exterior façade,
with the back of the stone left rough. The stones lying at random angles indicated that the area to the
south of the intact portion consisted of rubble or impacted foundation.

58

Figure A-2. South side of western foundation feature.
The contractor on site provided a trackhoe and operator to remove the bulk of the surrounding matrix,
while the RKEI archaeologists removed the soil and rubble adjacent to the foundation by hand. Much
effort was taken to ensure that the intact portion of the foundation was not impacted. The matrix
surrounding the foundation contained a low density of artifacts. Cut nails, plate glass fragments, rusted
wire, and various colors of glass container fragments were observed. A few identifiable items were
encountered that included a metal serving spoon, an aqua glass insulator, a milk glass cold cream jar,
and ceramic tile (Figure A-3). Cut nails in San Antonio were manufactured prior to 1880 (Fox et al.
1997). The cut nail was replaced by the wire nail around the turn of the century. The metal serving
spoon encountered exhibited remnants of enamel, indicating that the spoon was part of an enamelware
or Granite-ware kitchen utensil set. Enamelware utensils and cookery became common household
items between 1870 and the mid-1900s (Snodgrass 2004). Such items appeared in large numbers in the
Sears, Roebuck catalogues dating between 1908 and 1938 (Snodgrass 2005). Aqua glass insulators were

59

used often in lower-voltage electrical, telegraph, and telephone lines during the later portion of the
1800s.

Glass insulators were considered less expensive to than porcelain insulators. Aqua glass

insulators were very popular between 1875 and 1930, with a shift to using clear glass insulators in 1936
(Whitten 2017). The milk glass cold cream jar was likely manufactured during the early 1900s, with a
surge in popularity between 1910 and 1920s (SHA 2017). Although the cut nails appear to represent the
construction period of the building which predates 1880, the remainder of the materials noted date
between the late 1800s to the first quarter of the 1900s.

Figure A-3. Selection of artifacts encountered during foundation exposure.
Once the footprint of the foundation was exposed, RKEI archaeologists documented the feature’s
alignment. The southernmost portion of the foundation exhibited a different construction method than
that of the northern portion. The southern wall foundation consisted of smaller limestone rocks without
signs of dressing, and held together with a sandy mortar (Figure A-4). The mortar easily broke apart. By

60

comparison, investigations of a German constructed stone house at the Schob Farmstead along Coleto
Creek exhibited a similar mortar types, consisting of creek sands and lime (Fox and Livingston 1979).
Additionally, ethnohistoric documentation of the Schob family indicated that the structures at the
farmstead were constructed in a similar fashion to other German buildings during the Nineteenth
century in Texas. Farmstead construction patterns, layouts, and construction materials used mirrored
building and structures of similar use in Germany (Fox and Livingston 1979).

Figure A-4. Foundation at the southern portion of the feature.
The north wall foundation exhibited larger stone blocks with chiseled exterior façades. These stones
were fit together with smaller stones used as chinking (Figure A-5 and Figure A-6). A sandy mortar was
present in this area. Previous impacts to the northwest corner had removed the corner stone, allowing
for a view of the interior foundation construction. The exposed exterior façade of the blocks were
chiseled, whereas the interior façade of the stone were left rough (Figure A-7).

The differing construction methods included variation in thickness between the southern and northern
portions of the foundation. The south foundation exhibited a height of approximately 40 cm (Figure A­
4). The north wall foundation was approximately 80 cm in height (Figure A-5).

Overlaying the LEICA GPS data on the 1912 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map shows that the foundation
appears to be in alignment with the main section of the building depicted in blue (Figure A-9), even
though the southwest and southeast foundations are slightly off. Although the GPS data collected
averages at sub-meter accuracy, it typically collects data within 10 cm of the point. The GPS coordinates
indicate that the section of the uncovered foundation consisted of the central portion of the house, and
it appears that the foundation was divided into sections. Protrusions from the north and east walls
indicate that there were wall foundations that created the base of a room measuring approximately 5.5
m by 5 m. The southern protrusion appears to have delineated the north wall of another room that
measured approximately 4.9 m by 4.9 m. The south foundation of the 4.9-x-4.9 m room exhibited the
different construction method of smaller stacked stone rather than large chiseled stone.

The

north/northeast portion of the house appears to have sections of the foundation representing the back
wall of the original stone building. The foundation exhibited additions that were not comprised of stone,

64

as indicated by the color coding on the Sanborn Map. The building illustrated on the Sanborn Map
exhibits a wrap-around porch. The rear of the house appears to be a wood-frame addition and suggests
brick support this area. One possible brick pier, constructed of red brick, was encountered to the north
of the northeast wall of the feature (Figure A-8). Figure A-9 depicts both the encountered foundation as
well as the inferred alignment. The alignment of the foundation for the rear wall of the building
correlates strongly to the Sanborn Map, and may be slightly off due to the thickness of the wall. The
western elevation of the house appears to fall slightly askew from the Sanborn Map alignment.

Variations in elevation of the foundation were noted during data collection (Figure A-10). According to
historic topographic maps dating between 1927 and 2013, the house was sitting on the highest point of
the property, with the elevation recorded as 670 ft above sea level (asl). The northernmost point on the

66

feature exhibited the lowest elevation (669.034 ft asl). The highest point was recorded at the just north
of the southwest corner of the foundation. The changes in elevation are directly related to the extent of
the impacts to the foundation. The history of the property for the development of Playland Park
indicated that Johnson demolished standing buildings and graded the surfaces for the construction of
the attractions. The highest points of the foundation appear to have fairly consistent elevations, with
variations of just a few inches. It is likely that these points coincided with the habitation level of the
building, but also may be due to the fact that the area was graded flat for a parking lot for Playland Park.

The projected footprint of the foundation was measured to give an idea of the dimensions of the
building (Figure A-11). The north wall foundation appears to have had a maximum length of 15.7 meters
(approximately 51.51 ft, or 18.8 varas), while the south wall foundation exhibited a maximum length of
4.9 meters (approximately 16.08 ft, or 5.86 varas). North of the north wall foundation, each end
exhibited a section of foundation that abruptly ended. The northwest section measured approximately
2.4 meters (approximately 7.9 ft, or 2.87 varas) and the northeast section measured 2.8 meters
(approximately 9.2 ft, or 3.35 varas). The section of the foundation that connected the north wall
foundation to the south wall foundation measured 10.4 meters (approximately 34.12 ft, or 12.44 varas).
As previously mentioned, it appears that the foundation was divided into sections, marked by stone
foundations that extend from the north foundation and east foundation.

The different construction methods used for the southernmost wall poses some interesting questions
concerning construction sequence. Due to the missing section along the southern portion of the east
wall, it is difficult to determine how the north and east foundations relate to the south foundation. Field
observations suggest that the southern foundation represented the foundation of the front of the stone
house. The northern foundation would have been for the rear wall of the stone portion of the structure.
One could argue that the difference in the construction methods of the north and east foundations
versus the south foundation may be a result of separate construction episodes, but this would still leave
several questions unanswered, such as:

Why does only one wall foundation exhibit a different

construction method? Why do the north and east foundation exhibit chiseled façades facing to the
interior of the structure? What is the function of the section of foundations located at either end of the
northern foundation?
If it is assumed that the stacked, undressed stones are related to an earlier construction episode, it is
difficult to explain why only one length of wall and possible corner are present. The southeastern
portion of the eastern foundation appears to be missing and does not offer clues to construction, unless
it is possible that there was not a portion of the east wall that extended that far south. If the foundation
footprint is moved to the south, the exposed portion of the eastern foundation matches more precisely
with the footprint of the front section of the house on the 1912 Sanborn Map (Figure A-12). Is it
possible that the Sanborn Map is off in its placement of the house? If we entertain the notion that the
map should be adjusted, the foundation footprint appears to match certain characteristics of the house
plan. The north foundation would then have the chiseled façade of the stone facing outwards, and
would have been more consistent with the idea that the dressed portion of the stone would have been
what was seen from the outside of the house.

During the removal of the matrix from around the foundation, it became evident that the area to the
north-northeast of the foundation had been severely impacted by previous construction. The
foundation abruptly ended, and the matrix was filled with brick and brick fragments, glass, metal, and
flecks of charcoal (Figure A-13). The brick rubble was observed north of the northwest corner of the
foundation and at the northeast corner. In addition, a possible brick pad/pier was observed near the
northeast corner of the foundation. It was likely that the northern addition of the structure was
constructed of wood frame and brick, possibly on brick piers (Figure A-9 and A-10), depicted as red
squares in section labeled “?rick Nogged”). A fire would account for the presence of charcoal in the
matrix; however, no records of a possible fire were found in the historic records that can support this
theory.

Figure A-13. Brick rubble located north of the north wall.
The matrix noted on the interior of the exposed foundation footprint exhibited its own unique

73

stratigraphy (Figure A-14). Starting at the base of the trench, approximately 30 cmbs, was composed of a
light brown silty clay containing limestone rubble. Above this level was approximately 15 cm of darker
soils that contained charcoal, making the layer appear black in color. Intermixed in the charcoal layer
were fragments of rusted metal, thick flat glass, cut nails, and a spring coil. While the cut nails predate
the 1880s (Fox et al. 1997), it appears the other materials are consistent with the previously discussed
artifacts. Thick window glass of a similar nature was observed during the 1997 Alamodome excavations
was determined to be of later manufacture as these were excluded from the study due to their likely
association with safety or security glass (all fragments greater than 3.2 mm were excluded; much of the
glass noted in the current project rubble pile were greater than 3.2 mm) (Fox et al. 1997). Above the
charcoal layer, the soil consisted approximately 30 cm of dark brown loamy clay that contained some
cultural material, including cut nails, clear glass container fragments, clear flat glass fragments, and
rusted metal. The uppermost level of soil observed consisted of caliche road base, associated with the
parking lot that was constructed for Playland Park.

Once the exposure and documentation of the foundation was complete, portions of the foundation that
were to be impacted by the proposed project were removed. All limestone blocks removed were set
aside and will be reused during the construction of the Alamo Community Colleges Support Operations
Buildings. The exposed foundation was designated as an archaeological site 41BX2192. Due to the
impacts the to the foundation related to the construction and use of the property for Playland Park, as
well as the removal of a portion of the foundation for the construction of the Alamo Community
Colleges Buildings, the site will not be considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places or as a State Antiquities Landmark. RKEI does not recommend further archaeological
investigations of the feature.
