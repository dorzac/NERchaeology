Management Summary

1.0 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)-Tyler District, with partial
funding from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is proposing the
construction of a new bridge/grade-separated highway intersection facility along
US Loop 281 as it crosses the Missouri-Pacific Railroad at Farm to Market (FM)
Road 2087 in southwestern Longview, Gregg County, Texas (CSJ# 1763-03-029;
Figure 1). Along with the bridge/raised intersection, the project also calls for a
short (approximately ¼ mile) spur connecting Loop 281 with FM 2087 at the
project’s northern terminus. Overall, the project is approximately 0.85 miles in
length and occupies a total area of potential effects (APE) of approximately 39
acres (including 17 acres of existing right of way [ROW] and 22 acres of
proposed new ROW). The APE consists of all existing and new ROW, easements,
detours, and any area affected by the undertaking. In order to satisfy the
regulatory requirements outlined in Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (36 CFR 800) and the Texas Antiquities Code’s (TAC; 13 TAC
26), TxDOT sponsored an archeological survey of all areas potentially impacted
by the proposed project. On April 2 and 3, 2007, archeologists from Hicks &
Company conducted the 100% pedestrian survey of the proposed project APE,
and supplemented the investigations with three shovel tests. All of these shovel
tests were negative for cultural material.
Archeologists had access to
approximately 25 of the 39 total acres (64%) of the full project APE (33.7% of the
proposed new ROW). All fieldwork was completed in one field day, expending
approximately 16 person hours for survey.
Extensive disturbance was
documented throughout the project area (both within existing and proposed
expanded ROWs), and no archeological sites were recorded as a result of the
current investigation. Proposed construction within approximately 12 of the
undertaking’s 22 acres of proposed new ROW will not impact significant cultural
deposits, the remainder was not accessible and will require survey once right-of­
entry is available. All of the project’s 17 acres of existing ROW were found to be
highly disturbed and lack the potential of containing significant cultural
deposits. All work was conducted under the terms and conditions of the First
Amended Programmatic Agreement (2005) among the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), TxDOT, the Texas State Historical Preservation Offices
(TSHPO), and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and the
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the THC. The APE
is defined on the basis of current construction plans and schematics at the time
of the permit application and any subsequent modifications may require
additional Section 106 action. Mason Miller functioned as the survey’s Principal
Investigator, and Matthew Stotts completed the field crew. This short report is
submitted in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit #4477.

Definition of Study Area

2.0 DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The currently proposed Loop 281 improvement project (CSJ# 1763-03-029) is
located on the southwestern outskirts of the City of Longview, in southeastern
Gregg County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). To assist with traffic flow and
emergency response effectiveness, TxDOT has proposed the construction of a
grade-separated intersection and bridge facility along Loop 281 at its currently
surficial intersection with the Missouri-Pacific Railroad and FM 2087. The
project area is found entirely within the Kilgore Northeast USGS 7.5’
Quadrangle, running a distance of approximately 0.85 total miles along Loop
281. TxDOT has proposed an expanded right-of-way (ROW) that varies from 0
feet to 200 feet on both the north and southbound sides of the roadway. In
addition, a new, 175-foot wide spur is proposed to connect Loop 281 and FM
2087 in the northern portion of the project area. Overall, the project’s Area of
Potential Effect (APE) measures approximately 39 acres with 22 of those acres
composed of newly acquired ROW, which is currently under private ownership.
At the time of survey, right-of-entry (ROE) was available to approximately 32.9%
(7.57 acres) of the required new ROW (Figure 3). The remaining 17 acres of
project APE were composed of existing highway ROW and were fully accessible
by the survey crew. The project APE consists predominantly of commercial and
manufacturing structures fronting Loop 281 and FM 2087, however, there are
two tracts that have relatively little to no readily apparent development. These
consist of bermuda pasture or mixed hardwood vegetation. ROE was not
permitted for any of the potentially undisturbed tracts of land within the project
area.

The APE for the proposed Loop 281 expansion and grade-separation includes all
areas of direct impact within the existing and newly acquired ROW, as shown on
Figure 3. The APE is defined on the basis of current construction plans and
schematics at the time of the permit application, and any subsequent
modifications may require additional action under the TAC.

Definition of Study Area

According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas (1965), the underlying geology of the
project area primarily consists of Pleistocene alluvial terrace deposits (Qt)
associated with the Sabine River and its tributaries. The extreme northern
terminus of the project area coincides with the transition from Pleistocene
deposits to Eocene, Queen City Sands (Eqc). Soil Survey data for Gregg County
indicates that soils in the area are composed of Kullitt (KtB) and WrightsvilleRaino (WrA) loams and sandy clay loams (Roberts 1983). These soils typically
have between 5 and 20 centimeters of sediments that could contain
archeological deposits before transitioning to mottled, sterile, and compact clays
and sandy clay loams. Though no Holocene alluvium is located within the
project area, the potential for shallowly buried sites is moderate near drainages
and along hilltops, as is typical in this region. Ground surface visibility varied
through the project’s length depending on land use, however, as much of the
project area is dominated by modern development, the portions of the APE for
which ROE was obtained generally had good surface visibility. The undeveloped
properties, for which ROE was not allowed, were overgrown with vegetation,
affording virtually no surface visibility. Approximately 95% of the area surveyed
was disturbed due to modifications related to commercial development and
utilities routing. Within this context, there is little potential to encounter intact
archeological deposits. The greatest potential for intact site deposition falls
within the deeper sandy soils, encountered in the northern portion of the project
area.
Mottled, clayey soils, representing pre-Holocene deposits were
encountered here at approximately 90 centimeters below the surface. In the
southern portion of the project area, investigators encountered Pleistocene-age
clay directly beneath a thin layer of humus or at the ground surface. Generally,
the potential for historic-age archeological sites within the project APE is much
less dependent upon sediments and topography than those of prehistoric origin.
As such, historic-age archeological sites could be located within any
undisturbed portion of the APE.

Research Design

3.0 RESEARCH DESIGN
This research design describes a 100% pedestrian, intensive linear archeological
survey along approximately 0.85 miles of proposed improvements to Loop 281,
near Longview in Gregg County, Texas (see Figures 1 and 3). The survey took
place on existing ROW and proposed new ROW, currently in private ownership,
where ROE was permitted. The project’s existing ROW was visually surveyed to
determine its potential for containing buried, intact archeological materials and
was found to be too disturbed by grading and utility installation to warrant
subsurface testing. Additionally, the ground surface of areas for which no ROE
was permitted was evaluated from the existing ROW. Within accessible portions
of the proposed expanded ROW, shovel testing was conducted at a rate of 16
tests per linear mile, per 100 feet of expanded ROW width, in accordance with
the THC’s minimum standards for linear archeological survey. However, due to
extensive disturbance and severely altered terrain with greater than 30% surface
visibility within the project area, only three shovel tests were excavated. Shovel
tests were excavated to a depth of one meter or to culturally sterile soils,
whichever was encountered first. Soil from all shovel tests was screened
through ¼” hardware cloth. Because no deep, undisturbed Holocene soils were
encountered, and right of entry was unavailable for the properties at major creek
crossings, backhoe trenching was not conducted as a part of this survey.
Investigators recorded their observations and the results of shovel tests through
notes, standardized shovel test forms, and photographs. Since this did not
result in the finding of cultural materials, documents will be permanently
curated at the Hicks & Company offices in Austin.
Survey investigations followed a modified no-collection policy. Isolated surface
finds and non-diagnostic cultural material found in shovel tests were to be
documented, counted, and analyzed in the field and not saved for curation.
Only diagnostic material from sites was to be saved for curation at TARL,
however, no archeological materials were encountered as a result of the current
investigation.
All work was conducted under the terms and conditions of the First Amended
Programmatic Agreement (2005) among the Federal Highway Administration
(FHWA), TxDOT, the TSHPO, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation
and the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and the THC in
support of research for a project Categorical Exclusion (CE) that is in
production. The archeological investigations were conducted to satisfy the
requirements outlined in Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(36 CFR 800), and in accordance with the TAC’s standards and guidelines (13
TAC 26). All portions of the proposed APE that could not be accessed due to
lack of ROE that still require survey are to be delegated to a later survey and
investigated under a separate Texas Antiquities Code permit. This report has
been prepared to fulfill the requirements set forth under Chapter 26 of the THC’s
Rules of Practice and Procedure and in accordance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (1966, as amended) and the TAC.

Sites and Previous Investigations

4.0 SITES AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
According to data available at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) and the Texas Historical Commission (THC), no surveys have been
conducted that overlap or intersect with the current project’s proposed APE.
The absence of archeological sites close to or within the project area is most
likely attributable to the absence of surveys or disturbance. In adjacent
undeveloped areas, where surveys have been conducted, archeological sites have
been recorded. The project is located within the Caddo region of Texas.
Prehistoric sites in this region are often found on the tops or side slopes of hills,
overlooking creeks and waterways. Sites can encompass a single prehistoric
farmstead or be composed of a village, hamlet, cemetery or larger agricultural
complex. Artifacts and features recorded within these sites include pottery,
bone, stone tools and related debris as well as structural post-molds, storage
pits, agricultural field remnants and, occasionally, human burials. Background
research was conducted online at the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to locate
previous surveys and previously recorded archeological sites, NRHP-listed
archeological properties and SALs. The search found no previously recorded
archeological sites within the APE of the proposed undertaking. There is,
however, one site located approximately 600 meters east of the project’s
southern terminus. Site 41GG26 was recorded in 1979 during a water reservoir
survey conducted for the Texas Water Development Board (Whitsett and Fox
1979; see Figure 1). The site consisted of three chert flakes that were exposed
in a dirt road. Due to scant material recovery, the site was not recommended for
additional investigation.

Results of Field Investigations

5.0 RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Based upon the aerial photography that was available, archeologists arrived in
the project area anticipating a moderate degree of modern disturbance within
the APE, however, it was clear that these estimates were highly under-estimated
upon arrival at the project site. Throughout virtually the entire project APE
(existing and proposed ROW) surveyors readily observed extensive indications of
modern disturbance with only nominal portions that seemed relatively devoid of
impacts (Figure 4). Among the many impacts noted were markers for various
buried utilities, telecommunications taps, landscape modification and grading,
commercial and manufacturing frontages and construction, parking lots and
storage facilities; all located within the proposed undertaking’s APE. Indeed,
pedestrian survey of the project’s existing ROW did not require shovel testing
due to the overwhelming abundance of posted and DigTess marked buried
utilities as well as drainage grading and access drives (Figure 5; additional
examples of disturbance within the existing ROW are found in Figures 2, 9, 12,
14, 16, 18 and 19)

Figure 4

Undisturbed Western Property Between FM 2087 and SH 31.

Landowner ROE allowed surveyors to access four main areas (see Figure 3).
The APE immediately south of the FM 2087 along the southbound side of the
road was severely modified by a gravel production facility and livestock auction
house. In this location, the expanded ROW (measuring 1,000 feet long by 200­
250 feet wide) was composed of a semi-paved/semi-gravel covered parking
facility, along with large gravel piles and truck loading facilities (Figure 6).
South of the parking area, a small, highly modified unnamed drainage meanders
through the APE. Paralleling the route of this waterway, surveyors observed two
buried pipeline markers (one on each side) that occupy the entirety of the lower
terrace, and extend the full width of the APE (Figure 7). One shovel test was
excavated in the least disturbed portion of each bank’s upper terrace. Shovel
Test MM1, dug just off the southern edge of the livestock auction house parking
area and northwest of extensive push piles (see Figure 3), contained fragments
of plastic and asphalt through 40 centimeters of highly modified, 10YR4/6 silty

clay loam. The shovel test was terminated at an impenetrable layer of asphalt.
On the opposite upper bank, Shovel Test MM2 was placed west of a
telecommunications tap/stand and north of a commercial frontage (Figures 8
and 9). After a 10-centimeter upper humus layer, soils within the shovel test
immediately transitioned to bright reddish, mottled and culturally sterile
Pleistocene-age clay. Thorough surface inspection revealed no surface artifacts
or features (historic or prehistoric) and, citing the extent of disturbance and the
apparent erosional nature of the drainage, no further investigation was
conducted at this location.

On the opposite side of the road, the full accessible APE had been severely
graded and modified for a factory frontage (Figures 10 and 11). The buried
utility markers noted near the livestock auction continued to parallel the
drainage as it passed through the full length and width of the accessible
expanded ROW (approximately 1,000 feet long and 100-130 feet wide). Noting
the extent of disturbance on the opposite side of the road and the erosional
nature of the drainage, archeologists determined that this portion of the project
area also exhibited little potential for containing intact archeological deposits
and was documented photographically.

Moving north, the next accessible property was being used as a storage facility
and RV lot. Modern disturbance within this property included vegetation
clearing, apparent grading and leveling, parking facility maintenance (while the
majority of the area was not paved, a dirt and gravel parking pad was present),
and buried utilities (Figures 12 and 13). The northern edge of the property was
fully occupied by buried pipelines running perpendicular to the roadway while

another line crossed the APE diagonally (visible in the cleared treeline on Figure
3). Markers designated a third pipeline running parallel to Loop 281, which
occupied nearly all of the 13 meters of expanded ROW closest to the roadway
(Figure 13). While maps indicate that the southern property boundary is
located south of the drainage easement (see Figure 3), the property’s landowner
maintained that his property line was approximately 30 meters north of this
location, as was delineated by his fenceline. In accordance with the landowner’s
claim, survey was terminated at the property fenceline. Shovel Test MS1 was
excavated near this property’s southern terminus in a small open patch of land
within the 40-foot expanded ROW that was away from all pipeline markers and
parked RVs, and contained 90 centimeters of mixed, fine sand before reaching a
highly mottled and flecked gray and tan sandy clay that continued to a depth of
one meter below the surface. This test was negative for cultural materials.
Thorough surface inspection throughout the expanded ROW was negative for
cultural materials. Again, due to the abundance of modern disturbance and the
lack of cultural materials, this property was found to be devoid of any potential
for containing intact cultural materials and was not investigated further.

buried utility markers.
Finally, at the northeastern terminus of the project area, where the proposed
northern spur meets Loop 281, the last accessible property was immediately
considered to have no possibility to contain archeological materials, as the entire
APE was occupied by a paved/gravelled bar and liquor store parking lot. The
parking lot continued into the inaccessible property to the immediate southwest
and was easily observable. No additional work is necessary for this highly
disturbed area (Figures 14 and 15).

As can be seen in Figure 3, a large proportion of properties for which no ROE
was permitted (particularly those associated with the proposed spur) were also
investigated from the existing ROW and found to be devoid of potential for
containing intact archeological resources. Disturbance in these areas was
attributable to a second RV parking facility that was partially paved, gas
pipelines occupying the full expanded ROW, landscape grading and parking
facility maintenance, and residential frontages (Figures 16-19). Given the
abundance of indicators of extensive modern disturbance, these properties will
not require direct pedestrian survey. With the exception of one wooded area
that could not be easily assessed from the existing ROW, the proposed
undertaking will clearly not impact any significant cultural materials within
these properties.

Gas Pipeline Mains Near the Corner of FM 2087 and Loop 281.

Only two properties along the main expansion corridor were found to lack
obvious signs of modern disturbance. The large, open property that occupies all
of the southbound side of expanded ROW between SH 31 and FM 2087 did not
have any structures on it, nor were there utility markers or other modifications
visible from the edge of the existing ROW (see Figure 4). Aerial photography
(see Figure 3) and on-site observations indicate that the area was likely an
orchard of some kind in the past; however, the resulting extent of tree planting
and soil modification could not be determined. This location, bisected by the
same erosional drainage that crosses the project area in several other locations,
appeared to be relatively free of impacts. On the opposite side of the road, at the
northeastern corner of Loop 281 and FM 2087 is a small corner lot that is fully
composed of mature trees. Aside from one small cleared area with multiple gas
mains near its northeastern boundary, no other modern disturbance was visible
from the existing ROW (see Figure 19).
The majority of the central portion of the proposed spur was too far from any
accessible viewpoints within of the project area to be clearly observed. In
addition, a more densely wooded residential area near the eastern spur
intersection could also not be fully assessed.
While the prevalence of
disturbance in the surrounding properties suggests more of the same for these
unsurveyed portions of the APE, this likelihood is not conclusive and will need to
be confirmed through direct examination.

Conclusions and Recommendations

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Archeologists from Hicks & Company conducted an intensive survey of
approximately 25 acres of proposed bridge and grade separated highway
intersection facilities along Loop 281 in southwestern Longview, Gregg County,
Texas (CSJ# 1763-03-029). Occupying a total area of approximately 40 acres
(17 acres of existing ROW and 22 acres of proposed new ROW) and extending a
distance of approximately 0.85 miles, the proposed undertaking includes a
bridge, crossing FM 2087 and the Missouri Pacific Railroad, and a spur
connecting the Loop to FM 2087 further to the north. Including the 17 acres of
existing highway ROW, archeologists had direct access to approximately 24.86
acres of the project APE. Nearly the entire project area was found to be modified
by modern disturbance from pipelines, paving, grading and other impacts.
Careful surface inspection and survey did not reveal any historic or prehistoric
artifacts or features within any of the properties for which right-of-entry had
been granted. Three shovel tests dug at strategic locations within accessible
properties were either devoid of buried archeological materials or contained
abundant indications of subsurface impacts (see Figure 3: Coded Green). While
surveyors only had access to approximately 33% of the proposed undertaking’s
new ROW, disturbance was severe enough at many inaccessible properties along
the main roadway and the northern spur to negate any potential for containing
significant, intact archeological deposits (Figure 3, coded yellow). As can be
seen in Figure 3, all portions of the APE that bore clear indications of modern
impacts are recommended for no further investigations. While no shovel tests
were excavated within the existing highway ROW, the abundance of disturbance
from utilities, grading, paving and other activities negated their utility for this
project and no further work in these areas is recommended.
Two relatively unmodified properties that were not accessible at the time of
survey are recommended for further investigation once access is available (the
northeastern corner of Loop 281 and FM 2087 and the large property west of
Loop 281 between SH 31 and FM 2087). These properties are located within
typically higher-probability areas of the APE (adjacent to a small-unnamed
drainage) and were not clearly disturbed, from the vantage of the existing ROW.
In addition, while likely low probability, properties along the central portion of
the northern spur that could not be viewed are also recommended for intensive
survey once access is available (see Figure 3: Coded Red).
Overall, construction activity within all of the 24.86 accessible acres of the
proposed undertaking’s APE will not likely impact any intact, NRHP/SAL eligible
archeological cultural elements during the course of the bridge/interchange
construction. Additionally, work would not likely impact significant cultural
deposits within approximately 4.65 additional acres of proposed expanded ROW
for which right-of-entry was not available. On all of these properties, the project
is recommended as cleared to proceed in relation to regulatory requirements laid
out by the TAC (13 TAC 26) and Section 106 of the NHPA (36 CFR 800). An
archeological survey should be conducted on all properties not specifically
recommended cleared to proceed (totaling approximately 10.24 acres) under a
different TAC permit once access is available. Any future variations from the
currently mapped project APE should be coordinated and surveyed under an
additional permit. In the event that cultural materials are found within the
cleared APE during construction, all work in the vicinity should immediately
cease while a representative of TxDOT is contacted to initiate post-review
