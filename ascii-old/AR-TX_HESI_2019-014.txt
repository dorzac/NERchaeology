MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Berg-Oliver Associates,
Inc. (BOA) on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) to conduct an intensive
archeological inventory and assessment for the proposed Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 2090 at
Caney Creek Project in Montgomery County, Texas (TxDOT CSJ No. 1912-01-021). TxDOT is
proposing to replace the existing bridge and modify the bridge approaches at Caney Creek. For
purposes of the archeological survey, the Area of Potential Effect (APE) of the proposed
undertaking extends approximately 1.0 kilometer (0.6 mile) along FM 2090, roughly from a point
73.2 meters (240.0 feet) west of Palace Road eastward to a point approximately 242.3 meters
(795.0 feet) east of Crockett Martin Road. The existing right-of-way (ROW) of FM 2090 is typically
30.5 meters (100.0 feet) wide, though it expands to a maximum width of approximately
91.4 meters (300.0 feet) west of the Caney Creek channel, covering an area of approximately
5.6 hectares (13.8 acres). Based on available design plans, the depth of impacts is estimated to
be up to 7.6 meters (25.0 feet) below the modern ground surface for the bridge supports and
between 1.5 and 3.0 meters (5.0 and 10.0 feet) below surface for the remainder of the project.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by TxDOT, a political subdivision of the
state of Texas; as such, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (Texas Natural Resources Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191). In addition, the project
would fall under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)
of 1966, as amended, via the indirect involvement of TxDOT’s parent agency, the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA). As the project represents a publicly sponsored undertaking, the
project sponsor is required to provide the applicable federal agencies and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC), which serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state
of Texas, with an opportunity to review and comment on the project’s potential to adversely affect
historic properties listed on or considered eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SAL) under the Antiquities Code of Texas and for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) under the NHPA. The cultural resources survey was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 8850.
From April 24 to 26, 2019, Horizon archeologists Jesse Dalton and Jared Wiersema
performed an intensive archeological survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources
that potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking. The survey was conducted
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator. Horizon’s archeologists

Management Summary

traversed the 5.6-hectare (13.8-acre) project area and thoroughly inspected the modern ground
surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The project area consists of the existing
ROW of FM 2090 on the floodplain and adjacent stream terraces of Caney Creek. The areas
immediately adjacent to the existing FM 2090 roadway consist of maintained highway ROW and
associated infrastructure, including contoured drainage features, intersecting roadways,
driveways, and the existing Caney Creek bridge. In addition, two subsurface fiber optic lines run
along the southern side of FM 2090 within the existing ROW and then turn north to run along the
western side of Crockett Martin Road. Due to the presence of these utilities, no subsurface
investigations were attempted on the southern side of the FM 2090 ROW or immediately adjacent
to Crockett Martin Road. A large, cleared area is present to the north of the existing FM 2090
roadway that represents the former ROW of FM 2090 prior to construction of the modern bridge
over Caney Creek in the mid-1970s. All visible signs of the former highway have been removed,
and a two-track road traverses this lowland floodplain area between Buckingham Place on the
west and a turnaround adjacent to Caney Creek on the east. Vegetation within the project area
typically consists of short, manicured grasses, though dense forested areas line the banks of
Caney Creek. Visibility of the modern ground surface was poor to moderate across most of the
project area due to vegetative ground cover (30 to 50%).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of one shovel test per 0.8 hectare (2.0 acres) areas for
project area measuring between 4.5 and 40.5 hectares (11.0 and 100.0 acres) in size. Thus, a
minimum of seven shovel tests would be required within the 5.6-hectare (13.8-acre) project area.
Horizon excavated a total of eight shovel tests during the survey, thereby exceeding the TSMASS
requirements for a project area of this size. In addition to shovel testing, the TSMASS calls for
mechanical deep testing, such as backhoe trenching, in alluvial settings in which archeological
materials have the potential to be more deeply buried than shovel testing is typically capable of
reaching (generally 30.0 to 50.0 centimeters [11.8 to 19.7 inches] in wet and/or clayey sediments
or 100.0 centimeters [39.4 inches] or more in loose loamy or sandy sediments). At the direction
of TxDOT, Horizon excavated eight backhoe trenches within the portion of the project area
situated on the floodplain and terraces of Caney Creek. Subsurface investigations generally
revealed deep deposits of alluvial sand, loam, and clay sediments, though it is likely that the upper
soil horizons represent either artificial fill or heavily disturbed natural sediments associated with
the former FM 2090 roadway. A layer of asphalt, presumably associated with the former highway,
was observed in one backhoe trench (BHT-2) at a depth of 73.0 to 78.0 centimeters (28.7 to
30.7 inches) below surface, and the base of a sawed-off telephone pole was observed in another
backhoe trench (BHT-7) at a depth of 100.0 centimeters (39.4 inches) below surface, suggesting
at least localized disturbances associated with construction and/or dismantling of the former
highway.
No cultural resources of historic or prehistoric age were observed on the modern ground
surface or within any of the shovel tests excavated within the project area during the survey.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify

vi

Farm-to-Market Road 2090 at Caney Creek, Montgomery County, Texas

historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for inclusion in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as SALs according
to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and no further
archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However,
human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety
Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery,
and TxDOT and the THC should be notified immediately.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located approximately 2.6 kilometers (1.6 miles) northeast of
Grangerland in eastern Montgomery County, Texas. Montgomery County is situated on the Gulf
Coastal Plain in southeastern Texas. The Gulf of Mexico represents a structural basin formed by
lithosphere deformation. The Texas Coastal Plain, which extends as far north as the Ouachita
uplift in southern Oklahoma and continues westward to the Balcones Escarpment, consists of
seaward-dipping bodies of sedimentary rock, most of which are of terrigenous clastic origin, that
reflect the gradual infilling of the basin from its margins (Abbott 2001). The Houston region is
underlain by rocks and unconsolidated sediments that are quite young in a geological sense,
ranging from modern to Miocene in age. These consist predominantly of a series of fluviodeltaic
bodies arranged in an offlapped sequence, with interdigitated and capping eolian, littoral, and
estuarine facies making up a relatively minor component of the lithology. Major bounding
disconformities between these formations are usually interpreted to represent depositional
hiatuses that occurred during periods of sea level low stand. The oldest rocks in this fill are of
Late Cretaceous age. As a result of the geometry of basin filling, successively younger rock units
crop out in subparallel bands from the basin margin toward the modern coastline. While debate
about the temporal affiliations of and correlations among the deposits that underlie the major
coastline terraces remain active, they are of little direct geoarcheological relevance because
virtually all investigators agree that these deposits considerably predate the earliest demonstrated
dates of human occupation in North America (cf. Abbott 2001; Alford and Holmes 1985; Blum and
Price 1994; DuBar et al. 1991; Fisk 1938, 1940).
The project area traverses the floodplain, terraces and adjacent uplands on either side of
Caney Creek. Caney Creek forms part of the San Jacinto River watershed. Caney Creek flows
generally southward across the project area, continuing southeastward to discharge into Lake
Houston, an artificial impoundment on the San Jacinto River, in Harris County. The San Jacinto
River flows southeastward from the Lake Houston dam into Trinity Bay near Baytown. Elevations
across the project area are gently sloping, ranging from approximately 30.5 to 39.6 meters
(100.0 to 130.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl).

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the project area is underlain by the Pleistocene-age Lissie Formation
(Shelby et al. 1992). The Lissie Formation consists of clay, silt, sand, a minor component of
siliceous gravels. The project area is situated on roughly equal parts of the Angie, Belrose, and
Hatliff-Pluck-Kian soil units, with small areas of the Bissonet soil series on the uplands at the
eastern and western ends of the project area (Table 1; Figure 4) (NRCS 2019). Bissonet and
Angie soils are composed of loamy fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age. However, the

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). While
the paleoclimatic history of the coastal region remains unclear, Bryant and Holloway (1985)
present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas that includes three separate
climatic periods—the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.), the Late Glacial
Period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.), and the Post-Glacial Period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial Period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial Period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were
gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During
the Post-Glacial Period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable.
The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The
drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial Period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions
lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate
that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by
1,500 years ago.
The modern climate of the upper Texas coast, including the region surrounding Houston,
is classified as subtropical humid (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983), forming a transitional
zone between the humid southeastern US and the semiarid to arid west. The climate reflects the
influences of latitude, low elevation, and proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, which combine with the
urban heat island formed by the tremendous concentration of asphalt and concrete to give the
Houston area a notorious modern climate that is oppressively warm and moist throughout much
of the year. As a result of proximity to the Gulf and the abundance of surface water, humidity in
the early morning can approach 100% even on cloudless summer days, and it often exceeds 50%
even on the warmest afternoons. Largely as a consequence of the relatively high humidity
characteristic of the region, temperature patterns exhibit a moderate annual range and a modest
diurnal range that increases slightly with distance from the coast. Average monthly high
temperature ranges from a low of 17 to 19°Celcius (°C) (59 to 63°Fahrenheit [°F]) in January to a
high of 38 to 40°C (89 to 96°F) in August. Average monthly lows range from 4 to 9°C (38 to 47°F)
in January to 25 to 29°C (72 to 79°F) in July and August. Annually, average low temperatures
range from 15 to 21°C (56 to 65°F), and average high temperatures range from 27 to 29°C (75 to
79°F) (Abbott 2001; Larkin and Bomar 1983).
The Houston region experiences two precipitation peaks throughout the year (Abbott
2001). The first occurs in the late spring (i.e., May to June) due to the passage of infrequent cold
fronts that spawn chains of powerful frontal thunderstorms. The second occurs in the late summer

Intensive Archeological Survey of
Farm-to-Market Road 2090 at Caney Creek, Montgomery County, Texas

to early autumn (i.e., August to September) due to the incidence of tropical storms and hurricanes
from the Atlantic and, occasionally, Pacific oceans. In contrast, winter and early spring are
relatively dry, and high summer rainfall is dominated by convectional thunderstorms that are
relatively brief and localized, albeit frequently intense. Average annual precipitation varies from
a low of approximately 100.0 centimeters (40.0 inches) to a high of more than 132.0 centimeters
(52.0 inches). Average monthly precipitation varies from less than 5.0 to 8.0 centimeters (2.0 to
3.0 inches) in March to more than 19.0 centimeters (7.5 inches) occurring locally on the coast
during September. Almost all of the measurable precipitation falls as rain—snowfall is extremely
rare, occurring in measurable amounts in only 1 in 10 years.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

Montgomery County is situated near the southeastern edge of the Texan biotic province
(Blair 1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian
provinces and the grasslands of the Kansas, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some
species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texas province. McMahan et al.
(1984) further define four broad communities that characterize that portion of the Texas biotic
province that lies on the Gulf Coastal Plain: (1) coastal marsh/barrier island, (2) coastal prairie,
(3) coastal gallery forest, and (4) pine-hardwood forest (cf. Abbott 2001:24-26).
The coastal marsh/barrier island category includes well-drained, sandy, coastal
environments and saline and freshwater wetlands in the coastal zone (Abbott 2001:24). Marsh
vegetation is typical of areas that are seasonally wet and have substrates composed primarily of
sands and silts, clays, or organic decomposition products. Vegetation assemblages are strongly
controlled by texture, salinity, frequency and duration of inundation, and depth of the seasonal
water table. Sandy, relatively well-drained, freshwater environments are typically dominated by
little bluestem, switchgrass, Florida paspalum, and brownseed paspalum. Wetter environments
are often dominated by marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, saggitaria, bulrushes, smooth
cordgrass, seashore paspalum, seashore dropseed, olney bulrush, saltmarsh bulrush, saltmarsh
aster, longtom, sprangletop, burhead, arrowhead, coastal waterhyssop, needlegrass rush, and
other sedges and rushes. Slightly higher, better-drained environments are characterized by such
taxa as seashore saltgrass, seashore paspalum, gulfdune paspalum, shoregrass, gulf cordgrass,
red lovegrass, bushy sea-oxeye, and glasswort. A variety of fauna are characteristic of the shore
zone. Important larger taxa include raccoon, nutria, alligators, turtles, swamp rabbit, and many
birds, including ducks, geese, herons, and many smaller species. Aquatic taxa, including a wealth
of fish and shellfish adapted to brackish to hypersaline conditions, are also important in the coastal
marsh/barrier island zone.
The coastal prairie category consists primarily of grasses with minor amounts of forbs and
woody plants in areas that are not saturated on a seasonal basis (Abbott 2001:24-26). This
community is characteristic of upland areas and grades into the pine-hardwood forest to the north
and east and into the coastal marsh/barrier island to the south. A wide variety of grasses are
found in the prairie environments, but the principal taxa include big bluestem, little bluestem,
indiangrass, eastern grama, switchgrass, brownseed paspalum, sideoats grama, silver bluestem,
buffalograss, threeawn, and Texas wintergrass. Common forbs include Maximilian sunflower,

snoutbean, prairie clover, tick clover, wild bean, western indigo, paintbrush, bluebonnet, ragweed,

include mesquite, honey locust, huisache, eastern baccharis, sesbania, live oak, elm, hackberry,
bumelia, and coralberry. The frequency of trees increases dramatically as the coastal prairie
grades into the pine-hardwood forest, forming an open woodland environment with common
stands of hardwood trees and occasional pines. The coastal prairie is home to a diverse fauna,
including coyote, white-tailed deer, skunks, cottontail rabbit, many small rodents, amphibians and
reptiles, and a variety of permanent and migratory birds. Bison and pronghorn were also present
at various times in the past.
The coastal gallery forest consists of diverse, principally deciduous trees and associated
understory in floodplains and streams that traverse the outer coastal plain (Abbott 2001:26).
Important taxa include water oak, pecan, poplar, American elm, cedar elm, sugarberry, ash,
loblolly pine, post oak, cherrybark oak, mulberry, swamp chestnut oak, willow oak, sweetgum,
hawthorn, dogwood, hickory, bois d’arc, sassafras cypress, willow, cottonwood, and sumac.
Shrubs and vines such as mustang grape, greenbrier, yaupon, coralberry, possumhaw,
elderberry, honeysuckle, dewberry, and blackberry are common in the understory, as are grasses
such as little bluestem, big bluestem, and Indian grass. The fauna of the coastal gallery forest
include white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, turkey, a variety of small mammals and
rodents, turtles, snakes, and many birds. Black bear was also present at various times in the
past, and a number of fish and a few varieties of shellfish are present in the streams.
The pine-hardwood forest is characterized by a mix of coniferous and deciduous trees,
including longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, post oak, red oak, white oak, blackjack oak,
willow oak, and live oak (Abbott 2001:26). Riparian environments often support larger deciduous
trees like pecan, cottonwood, hickory, beech, and American elm. Understory vegetation varies
from relatively open to quite dense, and consists of shrubs, vines, forbs, and young trees.
Common shrubs include acacia, yaupon, mayhaw, wild persimmon, myrtle, greenbrier, Virginia
creeper, blackberry, dewberry, trumpet vine, gourd, and poison ivy. A variety of fauna is also
present, including white-tailed deer, opossum, raccoon, squirrel, rabbit, mink, skunk, various small
rodents, turtles, reptiles, and many different birds. Black bear was also present at times in the
past, and bison and pronghorn were occasionally present in the transition zone to the coastal
prairie environment.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region, a 21-county
area extending from the Colorado River on the west to the Sabine River on the east and
measuring about 200.0 kilometers (124.3 miles) inland from the Gulf of Mexico coastline. Much
of the archeological record in Southeast Texas represents an interface between the Southern
Great Plains and the Southeastern Woodlands (Aten 1983, 1984; Patterson 1995; Story 1990).
Further distinctions are often made between the inland and coastal margin subregions of
Southeast Texas. These two subregions are somewhat culturally distinct, and the inland
subregion has a much longer chronological record. The coastal margin of Southeast Texas
comprises a zone about 25.0 kilometers (15.5 miles) inland from the coast that covers the area
influenced by Gulf tidal flows on the salinity of streams, lakes, and bays. Considerable ecological
variability characterizes this subregion, including woodlands, coastal prairie, lakes, wetlands,
marine coastline, and barrier islands. The inland subregion also encompasses considerable
ecological diversity, including mixed woodlands, coastal prairies, and dense piney woods.
The human inhabitants of Southeast Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory. While many of the same labels are used to denote
Southeast Texas cultural/chronological periods, the timeframe and cultural characteristics of
Southeast Texas culture periods are often different than in neighboring regions. For instance, the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric time periods are different in Central and Southeast Texas, and
Central Texas lacks the Early Ceramic period that has been defined for Southeast Texas.
Mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time in
Southeast Texas. Inland sites are usually found near a water source, usually exhibit evidence of
reoccupation through time, have well-defined intrasite activity areas, tend not to be associated
with satellite activity sites or separate base camps, and exhibit a range of subsistence-related
activities. Inland sites tend to contain modest pottery assemblages, fired clay balls (at some
sites), abundant lithic material, and an absence of shell tools. Coastal sites tend to consist of
multicomponent Rangia shell middens that contain few lithic artifacts, oyster shell tools, large
quantities of pottery (in later cultural components), and numerous bone tools.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 5000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;

BOA242-10704T

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Southeast Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 5000 B.C.) (Patterson 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end-scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts.
PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Southeast Texas are
known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of
small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in
this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in North
America; rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced during all
prehistoric time periods.
In Southeast Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into two periods based on
recognizable differences in projectile point styles (Patterson 1995). These include the Early
PaleoIndian period (10,000 to 8000 B.C.), which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile
points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period
(8000 to 5000 B.C.), which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (5000 B.C. TO A.D. 100)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend signaled the beginning of the Archaic stage
(5000 B.C. to A.D. 100) (Patterson 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a
significant reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Southeast Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Southeast Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
14

BOA10704_arch_survey_report

Intensive Archeological Survey of
Farm-to-Market Road 2090 at Caney Creek, Montgomery County, Texas

Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. In
Southeast Texas, the Early Archaic period (5000 to 3000 B.C.) is marked by the presence of Bell,
Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, Wells, and miscellaneous Early Stemmed projectile points. The Bell
point is the only type in this period that is closely associated with the Southern Plains. Many of
the latter point types continue into the Middle Archaic period (3000 to 1500 B.C.) and several new
types appear, including Bulverde, Lange, Pedernales, Williams, Travis, and probably the GaryKent series. The Late Archaic period (1500 B.C. to A.D. 100) is characterized by Gary, Kent,
Darl, Yarbrough, Ensor, Ellis, Fairland, Palmillas, and Marcos points.
In the western part of inland Southeast Texas, a Late Archaic mortuary tradition developed
in the lower Brazos and Colorado river valleys and in the intervening area (Hall 1981; Patterson
1995). Organized burial practices actually started during the Middle Archaic period but reached
full development in the Late Archaic with the use of exotic grave goods such as boatstones and
bannerstones (probably used as atlatl weights), stone gorgets, corner-tang knives, stingray
spines, shark teeth, and marine shell beads and pendants. Other burial practices included the
systematic orientation of burial direction, body position, use of red ochre, and use of locally made
grave goods, such as longbone implements and bone pins. Most burials are found in extended
supine position, though some extended prone and bundle burials are also known. Burial direction
is usually consistent within single sites but varies from site to site. Patterson et al. (1993) report
that at least 11 sites are associated with this mortuary tradition in Austin, Fort Bend, and Wharton
counties.

3.3

EARLY CERAMIC PERIOD (A.D. 100 TO 600)

The use of pottery did not start uniformly throughout Southeast Texas. Pottery
manufacture appears to have diffused into this region from adjacent regions, primarily from the
east along the coastal margin. Aten (1983:297) argues that pottery was being manufactured on
the coastal margin of the Texas-Louisiana border by about 70 B.C., in the Galveston Bay area by
about A.D. 100, in the western part of the coastal margin by about A.D. 300, and in the ConroeLivingston inland area by about A.D. 500. The practice of pottery manufacture appears to have
progressed first along the coastal margin and then moved inland (Patterson 1995). Southeastern
Texas ceramic chronologies are best known in the Galveston Bay area, where Aten (1983)
established a detailed chronological sequence.
The earliest ceramic periods in the Galveston Bay and neighboring Sabine Lake areas
appear to be approximately contemporaneous with the earliest ceramic periods of the lower
Mississippi Valley (Aten 1984). Early assemblages contain substantial quantities of Tchefuncte
ceramics. In the Sabine Lake region, grog-tempered varieties of Baytown Plain and Marksville
Stamped are common, while grog-tempered ceramics do not occur in the Galveston Bay area
128.7 kilometers (80.0 miles) to the west until several hundred years later. With the principal
exception of a few Tchefuncte ceramic types, other southern Louisiana ceramics are not found
on the Gulf coast west of the Sabine Lake area.
Goose Creek sandy-paste pottery was used throughout Southeast Texas and somewhat
farther north in the Early Ceramic, Late Prehistoric, and the early part of the Historic periods (Aten
1984; Patterson 1995; Perttula et al. 1995). The Goose Creek series is the primary utility ware

BOA242-10704T

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

throughout the prehistoric sequence in Southeast Texas, though it gives way to Baytown Plain for
about 200 years during the transition between the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods before
once again becoming predominant into the Historic period (Aten 1984). A minor variety, Goose
Creek Stamped, occurs only in the Early Ceramic period (Aten 1983). Three other minor pottery
types—Tchefuncte (Plain and Stamped), Mandeville, and O’Neal Plain variety Conway (Aten
1983)—were used only during the Early Ceramic period. The Mandeville and Tchefuncte types
are characterized by contorted paste and poor coil wedging. Mandeville has sandy paste (like
Goose Creek), while Tchefuncte paste has relatively little sand. Given their technological
similarities, Mandeville and Tchefuncte may represent different clay sources rather than distinct
pottery types (Patterson 1995). The bone-tempered pottery that characterizes ceramic
assemblages elsewhere in Texas is not common in Southeast Texas.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 600 TO 1500)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 600 to 1500) (Patterson 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. Elsewhere in Texas, pottery also appears during the latter
part of the Late Prehistoric period, but, as already discussed, ceramics appear earlier in Southeast
Texas. Along the coastal margin of Southeast Texas, use of the atlatl (i.e., spearthrower) and
spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though they continued to be
used in the inland subregion along with the bow and arrow through the Late Prehistoric period
(Ensor and Carlson 1991; Keller and Weir 1979; Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In fact,
Patterson (1995:254) proposes that use of the bow and arrow started in Southeast Texas as early
as the end of the Middle Archaic period, using unifacial arrow points that consisted of marginally
retouched flakes. In contrast, Prewitt (1981) argues for a generalized date of adoption of the bowand-arrow hunting system at about the same time (ca. A.D. 600) in Central and Southeast Texas.
In Southeast Texas, unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade
technology. Bifacial arrow point types include Alba, Catahoula, Perdiz, and Scallorn. A serial
sequence for these point types has not been established in Southeast Texas, though Scallorn
points appear to predate Perdiz points throughout the rest of Texas.
Grog- (i.e., crushed-sherd-) tempered pottery was used in the Late Prehistoric and
Protohistoric periods in Southeast Texas. The grog-tempered varieties include San Jacinto Plain
and Baytown Plain variety Phoenix Lake. San Jacinto pottery contains a relatively small
proportion of small-sized temper, while Baytown Plain has larger amounts of sherd pieces that
are often visible on vessel surfaces. As previously mentioned, sandy-paste Goose Creek pottery
remained in use throughout the Late Prehistoric period. Rockport Plain and Asphalt Coated
pottery from the Central Texas Coast (Ricklis 1995) are found at a few sites in Southeast Texas
during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods.

3.5

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1500 TO 1700)

For the most part, Protohistoric and early Historic Indian sites in Southeast Texas have
not been articulated with the ethnographic record (Story 1990:258). Similarly, reconciling the
ethnographic record to prehistoric Indian groups in this region is problematic. Late Prehistoric
and Historic population movements further complicate this issue. Aten (1983) has reconstructed

16

BOA10704_arch_survey_report

Intensive Archeological Survey of
Farm-to-Market Road 2090 at Caney Creek, Montgomery County, Texas

the territories of native groups present in this region in the early 18th century, including the
Akokisa, Atakapa, Bidai, Coco (possibly Karankawa), and Tonkawa. The presence of the
Tonkawa in Southeast Texas may be due to their rapid expansion from Central Texas in the
17th and 18th centuries (Newcomb 1993:27). The Karankawa Indians are thought to have
occupied the coastal margin of this region as far east as Galveston Island and the corresponding
mainland (Aten 1983). Judging by the scarcity of Rockport pottery on sites east of the San
Bernard River, the ethnic association of the Karankawa Indians with the Coco tribe may be in
doubt.
Protohistoric and Historic Indian sites may not be systematically recognized as such
because few aboriginal artifact types changed from the Late Prehistoric to the Historic periods
(Patterson 1995). Only a few non-European artifact types are useful in identifying Historic Indian
sites, including Bulbar Stemmed and Guerrero arrow points and possibly Fresno and Cuney
points after A.D. 1500 (Hudgins 1986). Historic period Indian sites are usually identified by the
presence of glass and metal artifacts, gunflints, and European types of pottery.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1700 A.D. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Álvarez
de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay;
however, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernible at the Mitchell Ridge site, where the burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time heavy settlement of
Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished. The Alabama-Coushatta Indians who currently reside in Southeast Texas are
migrants who were displaced from the east in the late 18th to early 19th centuries (Newcomb
1961).
The earliest European explorer of what became Montgomery County was probably the
Frenchman René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, who evidently passed through the area in
16871. When news of French incursions reached Spanish authorities, they sent several
expeditions to the region to reclaim it for Spain. During the mid-19th century, the Spanish made
several attempts to establish settlements in the area and eventually set up three missions on the
banks of Spring Creek within the current boundaries of Montgomery County, but the missions
were abandoned in 1756 and no permanent Spanish settlements were established. The future
Montgomery County area was included in the colonization contracts issued by Spanish and later
Mexican authorities to empresario Stephen F. Austin, and, during the early 1820s, AngloAmerican settlers began moving into the region. Forty-two families of Austin’s colony obtained

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

land titles from the Mexican government and settled in western Montgomery County. Among the
earliest settlers was Andrew Montgomery, who established a trading post at the crossroads of the
Loma del Toro and lower Coushatta traces. He was soon joined by relatives and others, and the
settlement eventually grew into the town of Montgomery. During the early 1830s, the population
of the region increased rapidly, and, in December 1837, the Republic of Texas Congress
established Montgomery County, which was named for its largest settlement. The new county
was carved from Washington County, and its borders originally extended from the Brazos River
on the west to the Trinity on the east, and from the Old San Antonio Road on the north to the San
Jacinto River on the south, an area that included future Grimes, Walker, San Jacinto, Madison,
and Waller counties. The county’s present boundaries were established after the establishment
of Waller County in 1870.
On the eve of the Civil War, Montgomery County was in most ways typical of the counties
of the region, decidedly Southern in character and outlook, with a rapidly developing plantation
economy. Montgomery remained the largest town, but several other trading centers had
emerged, including Danville, Bay’s Chapel, Cincinnati, and Waverly. Methodist minister I.L.G.
Strickland began preaching in Montgomery in the early 1840s, and, in the early 1850s, Baptists
had organized the first church there. Several private schools also began operating during the
1850s, including the Montgomery Academy, which earned a reputation as one of the preeminent
schools of the region. The Civil War and its aftermath brought profound changes to the county.
Not surprisingly, given its large number of slaveholders, Montgomery County’s citizens
overwhelmingly supported the Southern cause, and nearly 80% (318 of 416) of those who went
to the polls cast their votes in favor of secession. The county’s men volunteered for the
Confederate army in large numbers, a sizeable number of them serving in the Fourth Texas
Regiment of Hood’s Texas Brigade; others joined Terry’s Texas Rangers (Eighth Texas Cavalry).
Many of the early volunteers saw considerable action during the war, and as many as threequarters of them were killed or injured before war’s end. For those who remained at home, there
were other problems to deal with, including lack of markets for goods, shortages, and wild
fluctuations in Confederate currency. The end of the war brought wrenching changes to the
county’s economy. For many of Montgomery County’s white inhabitants, the abolition of slavery
meant devastating economic loss. Prior to the Civil War, slaves had constituted nearly half of all
taxable property in the county, and their loss, coupled with a decline in property values, caused a
profound disruption for most planters. The African-American population of Montgomery County
fared even worse. Most blacks left the farms owned by their former masters to seek better working
and living conditions; however, for the vast majority, the change brought only marginal
improvement. Most ended up working as agricultural laborers or as sharecroppers, receiving
one-third or one-half of the crop for their labors.
Montgomery County escaped much of the strife that many other Texas counties
experienced during Reconstruction. No permanent federal garrison was stationed in the county,
and there was no Freedmen’s Bureau. Citizens nevertheless chafed under local Republican rule,
and there were isolated acts of violence and intimidation directed at African-American officials.
By the early 1870s, the local white elite had once more gained control of the county’s affairs, and,
through the use of the White Primary, literacy tests, and threats, managed to effectively
disenfranchise the black population until the 1960s. Like most of the counties in the state,

18

BOA10704_arch_survey_report

Intensive Archeological Survey of
Farm-to-Market Road 2090 at Caney Creek, Montgomery County, Texas

Montgomery County experienced a prolonged post-war agricultural depression. During the Civil
War, prices for cotton had skyrocketed, and landowners had planted ever-increasing amounts of
land in cotton to reap the benefits. After the war, falling prices and the loss of cheap slave labor
combined to severely depress the local economy. To make ends meet, many landowners opted
to grow even more cotton, badly depleting the soil in the process. By the 1880s, the soil in many
areas of the county was so poor that cotton yields were as low as one-third to three-quarters of a
bale per acre. Some farmers turned to livestock-raising or other small grains, such as corn and
wheat, but cotton nevertheless remained the county’s leading cash crop until the end of the
century.
The county’s economy began to recover in the 1870s and early 1880s with the
construction of several railroads. In 1871, the International-Great Northern Railroad was built
across the county; in 1879, a narrow-gauge line known as the Houston, East, and West Texas
was constructed; and, in 1880, the Houston and Texas Central built a branch line from Navasota
to Montgomery and extended eastward to Conroe. The construction of the railroads touched off
an intense controversy concerning the location of the county seat. The first railroad missed the
town of Montgomery. Willis, a new town on the railroad, was voted county seat in 1874, but the
county seat was moved back to Montgomery in 1880, after the Houston and Texas Central was
built. In 1889, however, the county seat was moved to the fledgling community of Conroe, which
was situated at the junction of the International-Great Northern and the newly built Gulf, Colorado,
and Santa Fe Railway. The construction of the railroads also sparked a major period of expansion
in the county. Numerous new towns grew up, and the population, which had risen only slightly
since the Civil War, saw a marked increase. Despite the loss of considerable territory due to the
splitting off of several new counties, the number of residents grew from 6,483 to 10,154 between
1870 and 1880, and population increased to more than 17,000 over the next two decades.
The construction of the railroads also marked the beginnings of the county’s great
lumbering boom. Commercial lumbering had begun in the county prior to the Civil War, but the
lack of easy access to river or rail transportation severely hampered efforts to exploit the area’s
rich timber resources. With the arrival of the railroads, however, lumbering quickly developed into
a major industry. By 1882, 45 steam sawmills were in operation, and lumbering emerged as the
county’s largest source of income within a short time. The lumber boom gave rise to numerous
new communities, including Bobville, Cowl Spur, Dobbin, Egypt, Fostoria, Honea, Karen, Keenan,
Mostyn, Leonides, and Security, all of which developed as lumber shipping points or mill sites.
The boom also helped to transform the county in other ways. As late as the early 1870s, 80% of
the county was still covered by thick pine forests. Over the next four decades, much of the county
was deforested, permanently altering the landscape and opening the way for a steady increase
in livestock-raising and farming.
The agricultural economy, which had been on the wane since the Civil War, began to
recover in the 1880s. Spurring its growth was the introduction of tobacco, which began to be
planted in large quantities in the 1890s. Much of the tobacco was a fine-grade variety known as
Vuelta Abajo, grown from seeds imported each year from Cuba. The center of the industry was
Willis, which had seven cigar factories by 1895. High railroad shipping costs and the high initial
investment and labor involved in curing and sweating the tobacco, however, discouraged many

BOA242-10704T

19

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

farmers; between 1898 and 1901, the amount of land given over to tobacco production fell
dramatically from more than 1,000 acres to only 70. The subsequent lifting of a US tariff on Cuban
tobacco, which had kept prices artificially high, finally ended the experiment, and no tobacco was
being grown in the county within a few years. The agricultural economy stagnated at the turn of
the century; however, by 1910, it began to show slow but steady growth.
The county, however, experienced a dramatic reversal of fortune in 1932, when oil was
discovered southeast of Conroe. Evidence of oil had been found in the county as early as 1901,
when Santa Fe Railroad engineers drilled a water well and noted traces of oil. Natural gas was
found southwest of Conroe in 1924, and several major oil companies acquired leases in the area.
The initial tests, however, were unsuccessful, and the companies lost interest. In August 1931,
however, wildcatter George William Strake began drilling a test well southeast of Conroe and, on
December 13 of the same year, hit oil; by June 1932, Strake had brought in a second, even larger
well, which was spewing out more than 900 barrels daily. The discovery immediately triggered a
tremendous oil boom. Within days, thousands of fortune-seekers, wildcatters, financiers,
roughnecks, and hangers-on flooded the area. The population of Conroe, estimated at 2,500 in
December 1931, blossomed to more than 10,000 within a few months. At the beginning of 1933,
more than 100 wells had been drilled, and more that 25,000 barrels per day were being produced;
by the end of the year, the number of producing wells had grown to 679, and the daily output was
more than 52,000 barrels. Oil was subsequently discovered in several other areas of the county,
and the combined oilfields of Montgomery County made it one of the richest oil-producing areas
in the nation. Although the vast majority of Montgomery County residents did not benefit directly
from the oil discovery, oil money contributed to a general prosperity that helped offset the worst
effects of the depression. Proceeds from the oil also helped to remake the face of the county.
Roads were graded and paved, new schools were built, and public buildings and monuments
were erected. Conroe experienced a construction boom as numerous new buildings, including
banks, offices, and homes, were erected with oil money. The population of the county swelled
during the boom, growing by nearly 10,000 between 1930 and 1940, increasing from 14,588 to
23,055. The prosperity continued during the years of World War II. Oil refineries and a carbon
black manufacturing plant were built, and efforts were intensified to produce as much oil as
possible for the war effort. After the war, oil production declined somewhat, but it has remained
one of the county’s leading sources of income; in 1990 alone, more than 2.7 million barrels of oil
were produced.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon performed background archival research on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and TxDOT’s Historic Bridges of Texas and
Historic Districts & Properties of Texas databases for information on previously recorded cultural
resources as well as previous cultural resources investigations conducted within and in the vicinity
of the project area (THC 2019; TxDOT 2019a, 2019b). Based on this archival research, no
previously recorded archeological sites, cemeteries, or historic properties listed on the NRHP or
designated as SALs are located within one mile of the project area.
The project area is located in a rural area northeast of the small community of Grangerland
and southeast of Conroe in eastern Montgomery County. A review of historical US Geological
Survey (USGS) topographic maps dating from 1960 to the present and aerial photographs dating
from 1957 to the present indicates that a standing structure of probable historic-age is present to
the north of the project area between Palace Road and Buckingham Place off the northern side
of FM 2090 near the western end of the project area (NETR 2019). This structure, a single-story
gabled structure, is visible on modern areal imagery, and the surrounding property appears to
have a large number of boats stored on it. It is not clear whether the structure is currently an
inhabited domicile. In any case, the structure is visible on historical aerial photographs and
topographic maps dating back as early as 1957 and is still standing today. The structure is located
approximately 35.1 meters (115.0 feet) north of the northern project area boundary. Other
structures are visible on more recent topographic maps and aerial photographs off either side of
FM 2090, though all of these structures appear to be modern; furthermore, none of them are
located within the project area.
No prior cultural resources surveys are on record within the project area or in the
surrounding vicinity.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

5.1

ASSESSMENT OF CULTURAL RESOURCES POTENTIAL

In southeast Texas, aboriginal cultural resources are relatively common on alluvial
terraces adjacent to prominent rivers, streams, and bayous. Away from prominent water bodies,
clayey fluviomarine sediments deposited during the Pleistocene epoch are common on and near
the modern ground surface throughout southeast Texas. While significant aboriginal sites may
occur at great depths adjacent to streams that contain deep Holocene-age alluvial packages,
intact aboriginal sites are rare in many settings in southeast Texas due to the relative antiquity of
the sediments, their shrink-swell characteristics, and their erosional potential.
Where
archeological resources do occur in such areas, they tend to consist of surficial scatters of artifacts
that lack depth and vertical or horizontal integrity. Based on the physiographic setting of the
project area on the floodplain, alluvial terraces, and upland adjacent to Caney Creek, the project
area possesses moderate to high potential for undocumented aboriginal archeological resources.
The soils that characterize the floodplain and lower terraces of Caney Creek are loamy and clayey
alluvium of Holocene age and have the potential for deeply buried archeological deposits. The
soils on the adjacent uplands are composed of fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age and have
potential to contain aboriginal cultural resources, though archeological deposits in these areas
would be expected to be constrained to the modern ground surface or shallowly buried contexts.
Historic-age cultural resources may occur almost anywhere in this region but are most
common in urban areas and in rural settings suitable for agriculture. Historic-age resources tend
to be visible on or near the modern ground surface. One standing structure of apparently historic
age is visible on historical USGS topographic maps and aerial photographs north of the project
area, though no standing structures appear to be present within the project area. Other standing
structures visible in the area appear to be of modern age. As such, the project area as a whole
has low potential for historic-age archeological or architectural resources, though the localized
area of the project area near the historic-age standing structure between Palace Road and
Buckingham Place has at least moderate potential for historic-age archeological resources.
The project area spans three TxDOT Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) map
units: Units 1, 2, and 4 (Figure 5) (Abbot and Pletka 2019). These three PALM units are
described as follows:

Map Unit 1: Surface Survey Recommended, Deep Reconnaissance Recommended if
Deep Impacts are Anticipated—This map unit is characteristic of areas underlain by deep
Holocene deposits that exhibit low to moderate surficial disturbance. The phrase “surface
survey” includes shovel testing, which is necessary in all Houston area settings to identify
sites.
Map Unit 2: Surface Survey Recommended, No Deep Reconnaissance Recommended—
This map unit is characteristic of Holocene-age alluvial, eolian, or colluvial veneer deposits
that exhibit low to moderate evidence of disturbance and rest on Pleistocene landforms.
As in Map Unit 1, the phrase “surface survey” includes shovel testing.
Map Unit 4: No Survey Recommended—This unit is characteristic of stable or erosional
Pleistocene landforms lacking Holocene veneers, Pleistocene landforms in urban contexts,
areas underlain by deposits of recent (historic) age, and made land (e.g., dredge spoil)
(Abbott 2001:156).

Based on the physiographic and geomorphological characteristics of the project area,
TxDOT’s PALM model minimally calls for surface survey (i.e., pedestrian walkover with shovel
testing) of the larger portion of the project area located on the floodplain and lower terraces of
Caney Creek classified as Map Units 1 and 2. In addition, due to the anticipated depth of impacts
associated with replacement of the existing Caney Creek Bridge, mechanical deep testing may
be required in Map Unit 1, which characterizes the floodplain adjacent to the Caney Creek
channel. TxDOT’s PALM model does not recommend survey for the eastern and western ends
of the project area on the adjacent uplands classified as Map Unit 4.

5.2

SURVEY METHODS

From April 24 to 26, 2019, Horizon archeologists Jesse Dalton and Jared Wiersema
performed an intensive archeological survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources
that potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking. The survey was conducted
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator. Horizon’s archeologists
traversed the 5.6-hectare (13.8-acre) project area and thoroughly inspected the modern ground
surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The project area consists of the existing
ROW of FM 2090 on the floodplain and adjacent stream terraces of Caney Creek. The areas
immediately adjacent to the existing FM 2090 roadway consist of maintained highway ROW and
associated infrastructure, including contoured drainage features, intersecting roadways,
driveways, and the existing Caney Creek bridge. In addition, two subsurface fiber optic lines run
along the southern side of FM 2090 within the existing ROW and then turn north to run along the
western side of Crockett Martin Road. Due to the presence of these utilities, no subsurface
investigations were attempted on the southern side of the FM 2090 ROW or immediately adjacent
to Crockett Martin Road. A large, cleared area is present to the north of the existing FM 2090
roadway, and a two-track road traverses this lowland floodplain area between Buckingham Place
on the west and a turnaround adjacent to Caney Creek on the east. Vegetation within the project
area typically consists of short, manicured grasses, though dense forested areas line the banks
of Caney Creek. Visibility of the modern ground surface was poor to moderate across most of
the project area due to vegetative ground cover (30 to 50%) (Figures 6 to 10)

In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of one shovel test per 0.8 hectare (2.0 acres) areas for
project area measuring between 4.5 and 40.5 hectares (11.0 and 100.0 acres) in size. Thus, a
minimum of seven shovel tests would be required within the 5.6-hectare (13.8-acre) project area.
Horizon excavated a total of eight shovel tests during the survey, thereby exceeding the TSMASS
requirements for a project area of this size (Figure 11). Shovel tests measured approximately
30 centimeters (11.8 inches) in diameter and were excavated to a target depth of 1.0 meter
(3.3 feet) below surface, to culturally sterile subsoil, or to the maximum depth practicable given
soil conditions. Sediments excavated from shovel tests were screened through 0.64-centimeter
(0.25-inch) hardware cloth, and the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all
shovel tests were determined using hand-held Garmin eTrex global positioning system (GPS)
devices based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Specific shovel test data are
presented in Appendix A.
In addition to shovel testing, the TSMASS calls for mechanical deep testing, such as
backhoe trenching, in alluvial settings in which archeological materials have the potential to be
more deeply buried than shovel testing is typically capable of reaching (generally 30.0 to
50.0 centimeters [11.8 to 19.7 inches] in wet and/or clayey sediments or 100.0 centimeters
[39.4 inches] or more in loose loamy or sandy sediments). At the direction of TxDOT, Horizon
excavated eight backhoe trenches within the portion of the APE situated on the floodplain and
terraces of Caney Creek (Figure 12). Backhoe trenches were excavated using a standard-sized

backhoe with a 0.6-meter- (2.0-foot-) wide bucket with a flat-edged cleanout to the lesser of a
target depth of 3.0 meters (10.0 feet) below surface, deposits that substantially pre-date the
Holocene, deposits that represent facies beneath which archeological potential is minimal, or to
a natural obstruction preventing further excavation, such as the water table or impenetrable soils,
gravels, or bedrock. In practice, trenches measured from 5.0 to 6.0 meters (16.4 to 19.7 feet) in
length and were excavated to depths ranging from 1.3 to 1.8 meters (4.3 to 5.9 feet) below
surface. During trench excavations, soil “lifts” (i.e., thin, subhorizontal layers) measuring
approximately 10.0 centimeters (3.9 inches) in thickness were removed from across the entire
trench, and the emerging trench walls and floor were thoroughly inspected for evidence of
artifacts, cultural features, or anomalous soil horizons that may suggest the presence of buried
land horizons potentially associated with prehistoric cultural occupations. A sample of backfill
removed from each trench was screened through 6.35-millimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth
during trench excavation. A minimum of one 5.0-gallon bucket from every third backhoe bucket
load was screened, though all backfill from selected soil horizons was screened if the potential
for subsurface archeological deposits was judged to be high. Following completion of each trench
excavation, a 1.0-meter- (3.3-foot-) wide section of one trench wall was scraped down with a flatbladed shovel to expose a clear stratigraphic profile for inspection and photography. A standard
backhoe trenching form was completed for each trench detailing soil characteristics, stratigraphy,
and the presence or absence of cultural materials. Color digital photographs were taken of each
trench and profile exposure. After recording was completed, each trench was immediately
backfilled and the ground surface was restored as closely as possible to its original condition. At
no time was an open trench left unattended. Specific shovel test data are presented in
Appendix B.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log
was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources. Diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. As no cultural resources were observed during the survey, the collections
policy was not brought into play.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

Subsurface investigations generally revealed deep deposits of alluvial sand, loam, and
clay sediments, though it is likely that the upper soil horizons represent either artificial fill or heavily
disturbed natural sediments associated with the former FM 2090 roadway. A layer of asphalt,
presumably associated with the former highway, was observed in one backhoe trench (BHT-2) at
a depth of 73.0 to 78.0 centimeters (28.7 to 30.7 inches) below surface, and the base of a sawedoff telephone pole was observed in another backhoe trench (BHT-7) at a depth of
100.0 centimeters (39.4 inches) below surface, suggesting at least localized disturbances
associated with construction and/or dismantling of the former highway.
No cultural resources of historic or prehistoric age were observed on the modern ground
surface or within any of the shovel tests excavated within the project area during the survey.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or federal
codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological properties are a
function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs, though
historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important historic events
and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources
are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological
resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs, respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The four criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant. This
concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures, districts,
or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent research
questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by three requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least one of the four criteria for eligibility listed
above, and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As
discussed here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory
and history according to various periods of development in various times and at various places.
Thus, the significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic
development and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular
period of development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding
of prehistory. All four criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought
to bear for historic sites.

7.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

BOA242-10704T

37

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

From April 24 to 26, 2019, Horizon archeologists Jesse Dalton and Jared Wiersema
performed an intensive archeological survey of the project area to locate any cultural resources
that potentially would be impacted by the proposed undertaking. The survey was conducted
under the overall direction of Jeffrey D. Owens, Principal Investigator. Horizon’s archeologists
traversed the 5.6-hectare (13.8-acre) project area and thoroughly inspected the modern ground
surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. The project area consists of the existing
ROW of FM 2090 on the floodplain and adjacent stream terraces of Caney Creek. The areas
immediately adjacent to the existing FM 2090 roadway consist of maintained highway ROW and
associated infrastructure, including contoured drainage features, intersecting roadways,
driveways, and the existing Caney Creek bridge. In addition, two subsurface fiber optic lines run
along the southern side of FM 2090 within the existing ROW and then turn north to run along the
western side of Crockett Martin Road. Due to the presence of these utilities, no subsurface
investigations were attempted on the southern side of the FM 2090 ROW or immediately adjacent
to Crockett Martin Road. A large, cleared area is present to the north of the existing FM 2090
roadway, and a two-track road traverses this lowland floodplain area between Buckingham Place
on the west and a turnaround adjacent to Caney Creek on the east. Vegetation within the project
area typically consists of short, manicured grasses, though dense forested areas line the banks
of Caney Creek. Visibility of the modern ground surface was poor to moderate across most of
the project area due to vegetative ground cover (30 to 50%).
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the TSMASS require a minimum of one shovel test per
0.8 hectare (2.0 acres) areas for project area measuring between 4.5 and 40.5 hectares
(11.0 and 100.0 acres) in size. Thus, a minimum of seven shovel tests would be required within
the 5.6-hectare (13.8-acre) project area. Horizon excavated a total of eight shovel tests during
the survey, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements for a project area of this size. In
addition to shovel testing, the TSMASS calls for mechanical deep testing, such as backhoe

trenching, in alluvial settings in which archeological materials have the potential to be more deeply
buried than shovel testing is typically capable of reaching (generally 30.0 to 50.0 centimeters
[11.8 to 19.7 inches] in wet and/or clayey sediments or 100.0 centimeters [39.4 inches] or more
in loose loamy or sandy sediments). At the direction of TxDOT, Horizon excavated eight backhoe
trenches within the portion of the project area situated on the floodplain and terraces of Caney
Creek.
Subsurface investigations generally revealed deep deposits of alluvial sand, loam, and
clay sediments, though it is likely that the upper soil horizons represent either artificial fill or heavily
disturbed natural sediments associated with the former FM 2090 roadway. A layer of asphalt,
presumably associated with the former highway, was observed in one backhoe trench (BHT-2) at
a depth of 73.0 to 78.0 centimeters (28.7 to 30.7 inches) below surface, and the base of a sawedoff telephone pole was observed in another backhoe trench (BHT-7) at a depth of
100.0 centimeters (39.4 inches) below surface, suggesting at least localized disturbances
associated with construction and/or dismantling of the former highway.
No cultural resources of historic or prehistoric age were observed on the modern ground
surface or within any of the shovel tests excavated within the project area during the survey.

7.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for inclusion in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as SALs according
to 13 TAC 26. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and no further
archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However,
human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety
Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery,
and TxDOT and the THC should be notified immediately.
