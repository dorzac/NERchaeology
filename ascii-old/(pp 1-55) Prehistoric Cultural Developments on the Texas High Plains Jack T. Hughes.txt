Prehistoric Cultural Developments
on the Texas High PlainsI
Jack T. Hughes

ABSTRACT
This paper accomplishes two aims: 1) it presents a brief synthesis ofthemain
cultural developments on the High Plains of northwestern Texas from the end of
the Paleoindian stage to the beginning of the Historic period, and, simultaneously,
2) it examines the possible effects of changes in the regional environment on these
cultural developments and on the surrounding cultures. Both climatic changes and
contact with other cultural groups appear to have been important in shaping the
prehistoric developments on the Texas High Plains.

INTRODUCTION

This necessarily brief synthesis is based upon nearly eight decades of work by
scores of dedicated prehistorians, both professional and avocational. It is obviously
impossible in a short paper to provide a detailed review of all their findings or a
complete bibliography of their publications. For the benefit of the reader who would
like to pursue the subject further, however, some of the more useful reviews and
bibliographies that have been published are mentioned, some other sources of data
are indicated, and the history of archeological research on the Texas High Plains is
summarized very succinctly.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Since few of the reviews and bibliographies published to date deal with the
entire region and all of its cultures, the coverage provided by each of the sources
mentioned is indicated. Readers are reminded that in addition to the sources listed
below, most of the hundreds of survey and excavation reports pertaining to the
region contain summaries of cultural developments and lists of references cited.
In chronological order, some of the major reviews are by Sayles (1935), on the
whole sequence of the region as part of his survey of Texas archeology; Krieger
(1946) on the Antelope Creek focus in the Texas Panhandle, as part of his study of

in 1981 except for the summary, figures, and list of references cited, have been provided to
several people and have been cited in several reports as Hughes n.d. Obviously, any future
citations should favor the present version over the unpublished, outdated, and incomplete
version.

Puebloan-Caddoan ties; Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954), on the sequence of the
region as part of their introduction to Texas archeology; Kelley (1964) and Collins
(1971), on the s equenc e in the Llano E stacado part of the region; Hughes (1976) and
Bandy (1977), on the Panhandle Archaic; Campbell and Judd (1977), on the
sequence in a large area of the South Plains as part of a survey report on the area;
Hughes and Willey (1978), on the sequence in the Llano Estacado and its borders
as part of an excavation report on Mackenzie Reservoir, and Hughes (1978), on the
sequence in the Palo Duro Canyon area. By far the best studied and reported
sequence on the Texas High Plains is at the Lubbock Lake site (Johnson 1987).
Bibliographies include a classified bibliography by Campbell (1960), as part
of his bibliography of Texas archeology, a chronological bibliography by Hughes
(1977) for the Texas Panhandle, a list of holdings of the Lower Plains Archeological
Library by Riggs (1977), an Antelope Creek focus bibliography by Lintz (1982),
and most recently, a northern Panhandle bibliography by the Office of the State
Archeologist (Simons 1988).
The main regional research centers for the archeology of the Texas High Plains
are at the museums and anthropology departments at West Texas State University
at Canyon in the Panhandle and at Texas Tech University in Lubbock in the South
Plains. A great deal of information, however, is in the colleclions, files, and libraries
of some other institutions, several local archeological societies, and many avocational archeologists. Most of the documents that pertain to the archeology of the
region have been microfilmed recently by the Texas Historical Commission in
Austin.
Archeology in the United States may have begun with the beginning of history
in the Texas High Plains. It is possible that a bison bone bed at Silver Lake in
Hockley County was the first archeological site to be recorded in the region and
perhaps in the whole United States. This site is probably the bone bed described by
Castafieda with the Coronado expedition in 1541 (Kiser 1978).
Although the archeological priority of the Silver Lake site may never be
proven, there is no doubt that the best known site in the Texas High Plains was
recorded as early as 1845, when Lt. J. W. Abert described the Alibates flint quarries
as "Agate bluffs" (Carroll 1941:64). The quarries may therefore be one of the first
archeological sites recorded in Texas as well as the only national monument in the
state.
Another well-known site in the region was also recorded at an early date, when
Lt. A. W. Whipple (1856) camped an extra day at Rocky Dell in order to copy the
Indian paintings and carvings on the cliffs. The giant rattlesnake depicted at this site
has served as a"feathered serpent" to introduce the Hall of the Northern Frontier at
the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.
Until native American domination of the Texas High Plains was ended with the
defeat of the Comanches and their allies in the Red River Wars of 1874, no real
progress could be made in the study of native American archeology in the region.
By the early 1900s, however, T. L. Eyerly (1907), a teacher at the former Canadian
Academy in Canadian, Texas, conducted and reported systematic excavations at the

Hughes ~ Prehistoric Cultural Developments

OldBuried City ruins on Wolf Creek in Ochiltree County. This is one of the earliest
excavation reports in the state.
One of Eyerly’s students was Floyd V. Studer, who commenced a survey of
Panhandle archeology, including excavations in slab-house ruins (Studer 1931,1934),
which continued throughout his life. Eyerly’s report of Pueblo-like ruins on the
High Plains also aroused the interest of W. K. Moorehead of the Phillips Academy
in Andover, Massachusetts. With Studer’s collaboration, from 1919 to 1920
Moorehead conducted surveys and excavations of the Panhandle ruins as part of a
study of the archeology of the Arkansas River valley (Moorehead 1921, 1931). In
1929 S tuder helped in the founding of one of the first archeological societies in the
nation, the Texas Archeological Society, at Abilene. In 1932 he helped found one
of the first major museums in Texas, the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum on
the campus of West Texas State University in Canyon.
Reports of the Moorehead expedition attracted further attention to the Panhandle
ruins during the late 1920s and early 1930s by J. Alden Mason, of the University of
Pennsylvania Museum (1929); Ronald Olson, of the American Museum of Natural
History in the same year; W. C. Holden, of Texas Tech University (1929, 1930,
1931, 1932, 1933); andE. B. Sayles, of Gila Pueblo (1935). SomeofHolden’s work
was also reported in theses by Haynes (1932), Lowery (1932), and T. Holden
(1934).
During the rest of the 1930s, in spite of the Great Depression but partly because
of depression-spawned projects of the Works Progress Administration (WPA),
archeological activities continued to accelerate on the High Plains as elsewhere in
the state. In addition to the reports mentioned above, work included a survey in Palo
Duro Canyon by Erik K. Reed (1936) for the National Park Service, a survey in
Lamb and Bailey counties by W. M. Pearce (1936), of Texas Tech, a survey of rock
art sites in the region as part ofa statewide study by A. T. Jackson (1938), excavation
of the Miami mammoth kill by E. H. Sellards (1938), excavation of the Blue
Mountain rockshelter by Holden (1938), a survey of lake sites in the South Plains
by W. C. Watts (1939), and excavations at the Antelope Creek and Alibates ruins
by Ele and Jewel Baker (1939, 1941; see also Johnston 1939).
During the 1940s, the High Plains suffered in the nationwide abatement of
archeological work caused by World War II, and growth did not really resume until
the 1950s. Several important investigations, however, were reported during the
1940s: the Lipscomb bison kill (Barbour and Schultz 1941; see also Hofman et al.
1991, this volume), Panhandle rock art (Kirkland 1942), the Quaternary of the
Texas High Plains (Evans and Meade 1945), the Antelope Creek focus (Krieger
1946), and the Plainview bison kill (Sellards et al. 1947).
Since the 1950s, archeology in the High Plains has experienced the same
accelerating growth as has archeology nationwide. The two principal trends
involved in this growth have been the impressive increases in organized avocational
archeology and in subsidized public archeology. These two developments have
often interacted to their mutual benefit. Most of the scores of writers and hundreds
of their helpers who have contributed so greatly to the archeology of the region

4

during the last four decades are still actively pursuing their interests. It is obviously
impossible in this context to recognize all of them for their contributions.
Although it has been more than 80 years since Eyerly’s pioneering excavations
in the Wolf Creek ruins, the fundamental task of descriptive archeology, of
chronology-building by answering the basic questions of who, what, where, and
when, is still far from finished on the Texas High Plains. Work is far enough along,
however, so that in recent years some tentative efforts toward explanatory archeology (to answer the ultimate questions of how and why) have become possible.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Since the cultural system consists of interactive subsystems, as does the
environmental system, and the two systems are themselves interactive (Wedel
1986), any attempt at tracing native cultural changes on the Texas High Plains, as
elsewhere, must consider both the modern environment of the region and the
environmental changes that have taken place during human habitation of the region.
The Modern Environment
The Texas High Plains includes all of the Southern High Plains except for
relatively small areas to the north and west of the state (see Figure 1). The Southern
High Plains is the part of the High Plains that stretches southward from the Arkansas
River valley in Colorado and Kansas to the Edwards Plateau in Texas. The High
Plains is a vast elevated piedmont plateau, an outwash plain that runs like a gigantic
ramp along the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains. It is an exceptionally well
defined physiographic province, blanketed as it is throughout its great expanse by
the Ogallala Formation (Miocene-Pliocene, Tertiary) (Holliday 1988), which is a
thick layer of sediments derived from the Rockies as they were uplifted during tens
of millions of years of late Tertiary time.
The Texas part of the Southern High Plains is more than 240 km (150 miles)
wide and 480 km (300 miles) long, and has an area of more than 64,000 kmZ(40,000
square miles) covering more than 40 counties. Although the upland surface
everywhere appears to be almost as level as the Gulf Coastal Plain, it actually has
a gradual slope from an elevation of more than 1370 meters (4500 feet) at the
northwestern corner near Texline to less than 760 meters (2500 feet) at the
southeastern edge near Big Spring.
Except for the Rio Grande, all of the major rivers of Texas have their
headwaters on or around the Southern High Plains. The northern part of the region
is drained by the headwaters of the Arkansas and Red rivers going eastward toward
the Mississippi River; the southern part is drained by the headwaters of the Brazos
and Colorado rivers going southeastward toward the Gulf of Mexico. The plains
have been separated from the mountains to the west by the headward erosion of the
South Canadian River in northeastern New Mexico and by the headward erosion of
the Pecos River in eastern New Mexico.

In northwestern Texas, the South Canadian River is known simply as the
Canadian. The plains to the north of the river are called the North Plains, and those
to the south of the river are called the StakedPlains orLlano Estacado. Alternatively,
the plains in the Panhandle are called the Panhandle Plains, and those to the south
of the Panhandle are called the South Plains.

The Canadian is the only river that cuts entirely across the Southern High
Plains. It crosses the middle of the Panhandle Plains, where it has cut a swath 30 km
(20 miles) wide and several hundred feet deep. The broad, deep valley is dissected
along both sides by scores of small tributary creeks that constitute the Canadian
breaks. These breaks form the northern edge of the Llano Estacado; the Pecos valley
forms the western edge, and the eastem edge, overlooking the Rolling Plains, is a
great escarpment formed by the headward erosion of the Red, Brazos, and Colorado
rivers. This scarp is especially rugged to the north, where the Palo Duro Canyon on
the Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River is 300 meters (a thousand feet) deep;
to the south, the scarp gradually diminishes in height until it merges, with a barely
perceptible break, into the Edwards Plateau. Throughout its length the scarp is
rimmed by vertical cliffs of massive Ogallala caliche forming what is appropriately
called the Caprock.
The uplands of the Texas High Plains are a vast expanse of level ground
relieved only by thousands of playa lake basins and, at rare intervals, a long shallow
valley tributary to one of the rivers that drain the great plateau. In the old days, the
region was essentially a gigantic buffalo pasture with countless waterholes.
The surface geology of the Southern High Plains has layer-cake simplicity. The
plateau is perched on top of Permian marine redbeds, which are the oldest rocks
exposed all around its margins. These rocks are overlain by Triassic continental
redbeds and Cretaceous marine sediments, except in the northeastern part of the
Panhandle Plains and northward, where the Triassic and Cretaceous formations are
missing. Capping the entire plateau is the Ogallala Formation, which has a thin
mantle of Quaternary cover sands.
Climatically, the plateau is a semiarid temperate-zone steppe with summer heat
and winter cold relieved somewhat by the low humidity. Precipitation comes mainly
from summer rainstorms and partly from winter snowstorms. The region is one of
the windiest of the continent, with prevailing winds usually from the southwest but
subject to sudden reversals by winter northers. The region is also one of the sunniest
in the nation. With so much wind and sun and so little moisture, the evaporation rate
exceeds the precipitation rate by almost three to one. Periods of drought are
characterized by blinding duststorms. During wet spells, the uplands become a
series of shallow lakes separated by broad expanses of lush green grass.
The weather year-round is so pleasant that people tend to take the good days for
granted and to comment only on the rare bad days. However, the usual mild
conditions are subject to abrupt and violent changes. For people caught without
shelter on the open plains, the awesome lightning and hail of summer thunderstorms
and the biting cold of winter blizzards can be "hazardous to their health."
The Southern High Plains are part of the Kansan biotic province. The uplands
are dominated by short grasses, the edge-breaks by junipers, and the stream banks
by cottonwoods and other deciduous trees. Sandy areas have oaks, sagebrush,
yucca, and prickly pear. The flora of the valleys and canyons is a rich mixture of
woodland, plains, and mountains species that provides a sharp contrast to the
monotony of the open grasslands. The chief game animals on the uplands were bison

Hughes ~ Prehistoric Cultural Developments

and pronghorn, in the valleys, deer and bear, but the region had a wide variety of
smaller game and is a major flyway for migratory waterfowl.
In Texas, although there is only a gradual transition from the South Plains
northward into the Panhandle Plains, there are some contrasts between the two
regions. The South Plains are drained to the southeast by the headwaters of the
Colorado and Brazos, whereas the Panhandle Plains are drained to the east by the
headwaters of the Red River and by the Canadian River and other tributaries of the
Arkansas River. The playa basins in the South Plains are fewer, larger, deeper, and
more saline than those in the Panhandle Plains. The South Plains soils tend to be
loose reddish sands in contrast to the tight brownish loams of the Panhandle Plains,
and the vegetation has somewhat more desertlike character, although mesquite
extends as far northward as the Canadian breaks. In recent decades, with irrigation
from the Ogallala aquifer, the uplands have become almost entirely cultivated, with
cotton the principal crop on the South Plains and wheat, on the Panhandle Plains.
On the uplands, the chief environmental zones are the grasslands, the frequent
playa basins (often with lee dunes to the south and east), and the occasional stream
valleys (sometimes bordered by sand hills). Environmental zones in the marginal
scarps and Canadian breaks are much more varied---canyon rims, cliffs, slopes,
benches, terraces, floodplains, and stream channels.
From the standpoint of early man, although the uplands at most places were
short of everything (water, shelter, wood, foodplants, and mineral resources) except
bison and some smaller game, the edge-breaks had all of these necessities in great
abundance. Springs from the vast Ogallala aquifer are found in most of the canyons.
The bedrock seldom forms good overhangs, but sheltering cliffs are common. Much
of the varied plant life has parts that are edible during one season or another. Stones
of various kinds for hearths, structures, and tools are always available. Some kind
of flint for chipped stone tools is seldom far away: Permian Alibates agate in the
Canadian breaks north of Amarillo, Triassic Tecovas jasper upstream from the same
area and in the Palo Duro Canyon, Cretaceous Edwards chert along the southern part
of the Eastern Caprock Escarpment, Cretaceous Dakota quartzite along the northwestern edge of the Llano Estacado, Tertiary Ogallala chalcedony at many outcrops
in the Panhandle Plains, and an assortment of siliceous materials in the widespread
Ogallala and Quaternary gravels.
The Llano Estacado in many ways is like a great sea of grass surrounded by a
rugged shoreline of upside-down hills. Just as fish are the principal resource of a sea,
bison were the principal resource of the Llano Estacado, and, like many seas, the
Llano appears, for the people who lived on opposite shores, to have served more as
a bridge than a barrier. As with sea travel, although storms were a hazard, crossings
were relatively easy and swift, either along the upland valleys or from one valley to
the next.
Environmental Changes
In recent years there have been increasing numbers of studies of various kinds
dealing with late Pleistocene and Holocene environmental changes on and around

8

the Texas High Plains. Comparisons among these studies indicate that most are in
general agreement, but reveal some differences from one kind of study to another
and from one region to another. Most studies at most places seem to be fairly well
in accord with the Antevs (1955) model of climatic changes for Arizona and other
parts of the western United S tates. This model proposes three main climatic periods:
a cool moist Anathermal from 8000 to 5500 B.C., a warm dry Altithermal (Long
Drought) from 5500 to 2000 B.C., and a moderate Medithermal from 2000 B.C. to
the present. Some of the implications of this model for the Texas High Plains are
suggested below.
During the cool, moist Anathermal, stream valleys and lake basins had ample
water, alluvial sediments were accumulating, soils were forming, dune fields were
stabilizing, uplands were covered with grass, and there were many bison herds.
With gradually increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation during the
period, however, vegetation was deteriorating, the giant bison were disappearing,
and the modem bison were declining.
During the Altithermal--the Long Drought--frequent spells of warm dry
weather, with heightened evaporation and lowered precipitation, diminished the
grass cover and exposed the ground to erosion by soil-scouring dust storms and
gully-washing cloudbursts. Streams and ponds were generally dry. Along the
drainages, channel sands were blowing, floodplains were accumulating dust layers,
and dune fields were expanding. At the playa basins, floor deposits were deflating
and lee dunes were growing. With water scarce and grazing poor, bison herds and
other game animals virtually disappeared from the Texas High Plains.
During the cooler and moister Medithermal, water returned to the streams and
ponds. Fluviatile and lucastrine deposition resumed, as did soil development and
dune stabilization. As water supplies and grazing conditions improved, bison and
other game returned to the region. Throughout the Medithermal, however, the
climate may have been gradually warming and drying (Antevs 1955:330).
The Antevs model is partly supported by Dillehay’s (1974) study of bison
population changes in the Southern Plains. His Bison Absence Period I from 6000
or 5000 to 2500 B.C. corresponds well with the Altithermal. His Bison Absence
Period II from A.D. 500 to 1200 or 1300 seems to have ended with an increase in
bison population during the 1200s on the middle Pecos (Jelinek 1967), on the
southern Llano Estacado (Collins 1968), and in the Panhandle Plains (Duffield
1970), although Duffield suggests a decrease in bison remains in Panhandle aspect
sites after A.D. 1300 or 1350. It should be noted, however, that the applicability of
Dillehay’s model to North Central Texas has been questioned by Lynott (1979),
although he does see an increase in bison population in that region from A.D. 1200
to 1600.
Henderson’s (1976) study of pollen changes in the middle Pecos supports the
Altithermal concept but differs from the Antevs model in other respects. Equating
arboreal pollen with mesic conditions and nonarboreal pollen with xeric conditions,
he infers a xeric period from 4500 to 2500 B.C., a mesic peak at 500 B.C. (instead
of Antev’s Fairbank Drought), a xeric period from 100 B.C. to A.D. 700, a mesic

Hughes ~ Prehistoric Cultural Developments

9

period from A.D. 700 to 1400, a xeric peak at about A.D. 1400, expanding grassland
until about 1880, and scrub desert during the last century.
A model of late Quaternary environmental changes in Texas proposed by
Bryant and Shafer (1977) differs in some ways from the Antevs model. Although
both models postulate gradually increasing aridity since the end of the Pleistocene
about 10,000 years ago, the Antevs model sees the overall drying trend as
interrupted by a series of droughts (the Long Drought from 5500 to 2000 B.C., the
Fairbank Drought at 500 B.C., the Whitewater Drought at A.D. 330, and the Great
Drought from A.D. 1276 to 1299), whereas the Bryant and Shafer model sees the
general xeric trend as punctuated by brief mesic intervals (especially one at about
500 B.C. in the Texas High Plains and lower Pecos regions). The latter corresponds
with Henderson’s mesic peak at 500 B.C. on the middle Pecos.
Although Bryant and Shafer cite Patton’s (1977) evidence of much flooding on
the lower Pecos from 5000 to 2000 B.C., they fail to note the coincidence of this
episode with Antev’s Long Drought. Shafer (1989) also notes a northward expansion of grasslands in the lower Pecos from 5000 to 2000 B.C.
Further support for the Altithermal concept is provided by Stafford’s (1981)
study of alluvial geology on the Southern High Plains in Texas. Stafford infers
increasing aridity between about 11,000 and 2000 B.C., with maximum aridity
occurring between 3000 and 2000 B.C. He sees a scarcity of archeological and paleontological remains between 6000 to 4000 B.C. and A.D. 1 as implying"decreased
use, if not selective abandonment, of the valleys during that interval," and notes a
significant increase in occupation of the valleys between A.D. 1000 and 1400
(1981:563). At the Lubbock Lake site, Johnson and Holliday (1986) and Holliday
(1988) have been able to refine the Antevs model with a more detailed and betterdated record of paleoenvironmental events, including evidence of a "two drought"
Altithermal.
To the east of the Texas High Plains, the Antevs model is generally supported
in geoarcheological studies by Gustavson (1986) for the Rolling Plains near
Quitaque, by Abbott (1990) for the Lower (Rolling) Plains near Justiceburg, and by
Hall (1982, 1988) for the Osage (Rolling) Plains in Oklahoma. In western Oklahoma, paleoenvironmental evidence for a moist first millennium A.D. has been
reported at Delaware Canyon (Ferring 1982, 1986) and at Carnegie Canyon (Lintz
and Hall 1983). As will be explained later, several sites in the Palo Duro Canyon area
have produced good evidence of mesic conditions during much of the first
millennium A.D. (Hughes 1978:43--44).
Baerreis and Bryson (1965) have suggested that the Texas and Oklahoma
panhandles were receiving more precipitation from A.D. 1250 to 1450 than were
other regions in the Central and Southern Plains. However, studies by Duffield
(1970) in the Texas Panhandle and by Wilson (1972) and Lintz (1978a) in the
Oklahoma Panhandle fail to support this idea.

CULTURAL CONTEXT

Since archeology on the Texas High Plains shows that the region was used
throughout prehistory by groups from all of the neighboring regions, one cannot
deal with the cultural developments in the region without some background on the
sequences found in the surrounding regions, in other states as well as in Texas.
On and around the Texas High Plains, there has been general usage of four main
temporal units for tracing native cultural developments, but much diversity in
naming, defining, and dating the units. In essence the four main units are 1) an early
prehistoric time of late Pleistocene big-game hunters with lance points, 2) a middle
prehistoric time of foragers with dart points, 3) a late prehistoric time of gardeners
(usually) with arrowpoints and/or pottery, and 4) historic time.
Although these units are generally thought of and frequently referred to as
periods, in Texas they have usually been called stages, as recommended by Suhm,
Kreiger, and Jelks (1954), who pointed out that they actually are stages of cultural
development that differ somewhat in time from one place to another. There is now
a tendency among Texas writers to call them periods, but in this paper they will
continue to be called stages.
Except for the Historic era, which has seldom been called anything else, each
of the four stages has been variously labeled, especially the third, which still has no
generally accepted label. In Texas the first three stages have usually been called
Paleo-American, Archaic, and Neo-American, as proposed by Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks, but many writers have continued to use Paleoindian for the first stage, and in
recent years, some have preferred Late Prehistoric for the third stage. For the Texas
High Plains, this paper will call the four stages Paleoindian, Archaic (although
Mesoindian is preferred), Neoindian, and Historic, and both the Archaic and
Neoindian stages will be subdivided into Early and Late substages.
The terms Paleoindian, Mesoindian, and Neoindian are barbarous neologisms,
but they have the virtue of inviting valid comparisons with the Paleolithic,
Mesolithic, and Neolithic stages in the Old World. We seem to be stuck with the
term Archaic, but the author cannot accept Late Prehistoric for a stage that begins
as early as the time of Christ. In the Justiceburg area (Boyd and Tomka 1990), we
already have Late Prehistoric I and Late Prehistoric II, in order to avoid the
ridiculous alternatives of Early Late Prehistoric and Late Late Prehistoric. If the
term Neoindian must be discarded, a Ceramic stage would be better than a Late
Prehistoric stage.
In reviewing the archeological literature pertaining to the Texas High Plains
and surrounding regions, it has become painfully obvious that there is little
agreement on how to define the boundaries of the stages and substages of the native
cultural development, and therefore on the dates for these boundaries. The Late
Paleoindian/Early Archaic boundary is placed by some at the last lanceolate points
and by some at the first stemmed points, whereas others recognize a transitional
period for the assemblages with both kinds of points, and others prefer a definition
based on changing subsistence patterns. One of the worst boundary problems
concerns the beginning and ending of a Middle Archaic substage, where the

Hughes -- Prehistoric Cultural Developments

11

differences are acute and the issue is seldom explicitly addressed. The Late Archaic/
Early Neoindian boundary is also variously and vaguely defined, beset not only by
regional differences in the time of appearance of pottery and the bow, but also by
a gradual size reduction of dart point forms into arrowpoint forms, as well as by a
lingering use of the atlatl long after the bow was known, differentially in different
regions. The Early Neoindian/Late Neoindian boundary problem is similarly
unsettled, the boundary being variously defined on the basis of arrowpoint changes,
pottery changes, or lifestyle changes. And finally, the Late Neoindian~arly
Historic boundary is notoriously variable from place to place, depending on how
early or late the first significant European influences appear in a particular region.
With regard to culture units, the position of the Texas High Plains between the
Great Plains and the Southwest has left the region influenced by various taxonomic
systems from both directions. To the north, east, and south, the aspects and foci of
McKern are giving way in some regions to the phases of Willey and Phillips. To the
southwest, the Gladwin system of branches and phases for the Mogollon tradition
still prevails, but to the northwest, the Kidder system of Basketmaker I-III and
Pueblo I-IV periods for the Anasazi tradition seem to be giving way to phases. In
this paper the terminology appropriate to each region and/or writer will be used, and
complexes will be used for ill-defined units and as a general term.
In summarizing the culture sequences on and around the Texas High Plains, it
is convenient to examine the Panhandle Plains and its surroundings separately from
the South Plains and its surroundings, since the sequences in both regions generally
resemble the surrounding sequences more than they resemble each other and have
been investigated more in conjunction with their surroundings than with each other.
The Panhandle Plains
On the Panhandle Plains and in the surrounding regions to the north, east, and
west, much similarity is recognizable in native cultural developments through the
Archaic and Neoindian stages, although a great deal is yet to be learned, especially
for the Archaic. In the High Plains of southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas,
and the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles, in the Rolling Plains of Oklahoma, and
in the headwaters of the Canadian River in northeastern New Mexico, the Archaic
stage has generally been seen as having vague Early and Late subdivisions, the Early
starting at about 5000 B.C. (with the start of the Altithermal) and the Late at about
2000 B.C. (with the start of the Medithermal). The start of the Early Archaic is
perhaps best marked by a few kinds of stemmed dart points replacing stemless lance
points. No culture complexes have been identified for the Early Archaic in these
regions, although one candidate may be the complex represented by the Gore Pit site
in western Oklahoma.
The start of the Late Archaic is perhaps best marked by the appearance of
several kinds of barbed dart points in large numbers. Only a few ill-def’med
complexes have been proposed: the Little Sunday complex (J. Hughes 1955) in the
Panhandle Plains, and a Summers complex and Lawton aspect in western Oklahoma
(D. Hughes 1984).

The Neoindian stage in these regions is much better known, and is generally
seen as consisting of Plains Woodland (Early) and Plains Village (Late) subdivisions, the Early substage starting at about A.D. 200 (with the first arrowpoints and/
or pottery) and the Late substage at about A.D. 1100 (with side-notched triangular
arrowpoints replacing barbed arrowpoints). Several Early Neoindian complexes
have been recognized in these regions. In southeastern Colorado is the Graneros
focus with the usual Plains Woodland corner-notched arrowpoints and conical
cordmarked vessels from about A.D. 200 to 1000. In southwestern Kansas are
components possibly representing the Keith focus with typical Woodland points
and pots at about A.D. 700. In the Oklahoma Panhandle are unassigned Woodland
components. In the Panhandle Plains of Texas, from the Canadian breaks northward, is the Lake Creek focus with Woodland points and pots, of uncertain temporal
span. Also in the Panhandle Plains, from the Canadian breaks southward, is the Palo
Duro complex with long-barbed (Deadman) arrowpoints and plain (Mogollon)
brownware pottery, from about A.D. 200 to 1000. In western Oklahoma is the Pruitt
complex, with Woodland points and pots at about A.D. 700 to 800. In northeastern
New Mexico, in the plains to the east, are unassigned Woodland components; also
in northeastern New Mexico, in the foothills to the west, are two named Basketmaker
II and III phases, from about A.D. 400 to 900.
In western Oklahoma, although the Custer focus has generally been regarded
as a Village complex, it has been seen recently as transitional out of Woodland, and
to this observer it seems to be much more a late Woodland than an early Village
complex in both cultural character and temporal position. There is some evidence
of houses, but the complex has barbed arrowpoints and conical cordmarked vessels
and has few bison remains and bison-bone tools. It is dated from about A.D. 800 to
1100.
Some Late Neoindian complexes have been recognized on and around the
Panhandle Plains. In southeastern Colorado is the Apishapa focus with slab houses,
side-notched triangular arrowpoints, and globular cordmarked vessels, from about
A.D. 1000 to 1300. In southwestern Kansas are possible components of the Upper
Republican culture, with points and pots like the Apishapa focus, but semisubterranean houses, from about A.D. 1100 to 1250. In the Oklahoma Panhandle is the
Optima focus, with diagnostics like the Apishapa focus, from about A.D. 1100 to
1450. In the Panhandle Plains is the Antelope Creek focus with diagnostics and span
like the Optima focus. In western Oklahoma is the Washita River focus with surface
houses, side-notched triangular arrowpoints, and plain pottery, from about A.D.
1100 to 1450. In northeastern New Mexico, in the eastern plains, are unassigned
Village components. Also in northeastern New Mexico, in the western foothills, are
three named Pueblo I-III phases from about A.D. 900 to 1300.
Throughout the Panhandle Plains and adjoining regions to the north, east, and
west, it seems likely that there was ethnic continuity from Early Neoindian time, and
possibly from Late Archaic time, leading into historic Plains Caddoan groups-except for the foothill phases in northeastern New Mexico----of probable Tanoan
affiliation.

The South Plains
The South Plains and surrounding regions are perhaps more diverse both
naturally and culturally than the Panhandle Plains and its surroundings. This
diversity is reflected in a plethora of systems for designating and subdividing the
four main stages of native cultural development and in dating the stages and their
subdivisions.
During the Archaic stage, the strongest cultural influences on the South Plains
seem to have been coming from the Edwards Plateau to the southeast, from the lower
Pecos to the south, and Rolling Plains to the east. During the Neoindian stage, the
strongest influences seem to have come from the middle Pecos to the west.
The Archaic stage is best known in Central Texas, fairly well known in
southwestern Texas, and poorly known in North Central Texas, on the South Plains,
and in southeastern New Mexico. The Archaic in these regions is usually regarded
as starting at about 5000 B.C., except in Central and southwestern Texas, where the
start is usually placed at about 6000 B.C. The difference, however, appears to be a
matter of definition. Prewitt’s (1981) initial Archaic Circleville phase in Central
Texas from 6500 to 5000 B.C. is characterized solely by lance points elsewhere
regarded as terminal Paleoindian rather than as initial Archaic.
The Central Texas Archaic has been subdivided into early, middle, and late foci
(Clear Fork, Round Rock, and Uvalde) by Kelley (1947); into a sequence of five
named phases by Weir (1976); and recently into a sequence of 11 named phases
(four early, four middle, and three late) by Prewitt (1981, 1985). The southwestern
Texas Archaic has been subdivided into an early Pecos River focus and a late Chisos
focus by Kelley, Campbell, and Lehmer (1940); into Periods 1,2, and 3 by Epstein
(1963); now, for the lower Pecos, into early, middle, and late periods by Shafer
(1989), and for the eastern trans-Pecos, into the same periods, except that they are
preceded and followed by transitional periods, by Mallouf (1985, 1987). In the
Rolling Plains of North Central Texas, a five-fold subdivision of the Archaic into
Initial, Early, Middle, Late, and Terminal substages, analogous to Weir’s five
named phases in Central Texas, has been proposed by Etchieson, Speer, and
Hughes (1978). An Early Archaic Bitter Creek complex and a Late Archaic Twilla
complex have also been proposed for this region by Hughes (1978). In the South
Plains, a three-fold subdivision of the Archaic into early, middle, and late has been
proposed by Campbell and Judd (1977). In southeastern New Mexico, a two-fold
subdivision of the Archaic into early and late is implicit in the general use of a Late
Archaic Hueco phase as the start of the Jornada branch of the Mogollon tradition.
All of the proposed subdivisions of the Archaic in all of the above regions are
marked chiefly by changes in dart point types, and there is some disagreement over
which types mark which subdivisions, and on time spans involved. The Neoindian
stage on the South Plains and in surrounding regions is relatively brief, unevenly
known, and variously subdivided and dated. Although the strongest influences on
the South Plains during the Neoindian stage may have come from southeastern New
Mexico, elements from Central, southwestern, and North Central Texas are also
discernible. The starting date of the Neoindian stage in these regions, with the first

14

Texas Archeological Society

arrowpoints and/or pottery, is variously estimated at before A.D. 900 for the South
Plains, about A.D. 700 in Central Texas, about A.D. 1000 in southwestern Texas,
an unknown date in North Central Texas, and before A.D. 900 in southeastem New
Mexico.
In much of the South Plains the Neoindian stage has not been subdivided, and
no complexes have been recognized, but in the southwestem part there has been
proposed an eastern extension of the Jomada branch, with three named phases
marked by changes from pit to surface houses, corner-notched-to-triangular arrowpoints, and plain-to-polychrome pottery, from about A.D. 900 to 1500. In Central
Texas, an Austin phase with Scallom arrowpoints from about A.D. 700 to 1300. is
followed by a Toyah phase with Perdiz and Cliffton arrowpoints and Leon Plain and
Doss Redware pottery from about A.D. 1300 to 1700. In southwestern Texas,
directly south of the South Plains, is the Toyah focus; further south in the TransPecos is the Livermore focus with Livermore points from about A.D. 900 to 1300;
still further south in the Presidio area is the Bravo Valley aspect with both pit and
surface houses, triangular arrowpoints, and polychrome pottery from about A.D.
1300 to 1600. In North Central Texas is the Henrietta focus, with triangular
arrowpoints and Nocona Plain pottery, from before A.D. 1400 to about 1600. In
southeastern New Mexico is a Southern Jornada sequence (also in the northern part
of the eastern trans-Pecos and in the E1 Paso area), a Northern Jomada sequence, an
Eastern Jomada sequence, and a Middle Pecos sequence, each with its own set of
three named phases and all dated from before A.D. 900 to about A.D. 1300 or 1400
or 1500. All are characterized by changes from pit to surface houses, corner-notched
to triangular arrowpoints, and plain to painted pottery.
From the above summary of Neoindian sequences on and around the South
Plains, it becomes apparent that a good marker for an early-late subdivision of the
stage would be the shift from comer-notched (Scallorn-like) arrowpoints into
various triangular types (and Perdiz). This shift seems to have occurred at about
A.D. 1200 in the southwestern part of the South Plains, about A.D. 1300 in Central
and southwestern Texas, an undetermined date in North Central Texas, and about
A.D. 1200 in southeastern New Mexico. In each region the arrowpoint change
seems to be about contemporaneous with other changes of more importance but
with less utility as boundary markers.
Ethnic continuities on and around the South Plains seem to have been quite
diverse. Ethnic affiliations on the South Plains may have been mainly those of
various adjoining regions. Ethnic continuity has been suggested throughout the
Archaic and Neoindian stages into historic Tonkawans for Central Texas and into
historic Coahuiltecans for southwestern Texas, except that the Toyah focus of both
regions may have been ancestral to the mysterious Jumanos. In North Central Texas
the Henrietta focus is probably ancestral to some historic Plains Caddoan group
such as the Kichai. In southeastern New Mexico the Jomada branch may have been
ancestral to historic Tanoans.
Throughout the Texas High Plains and in most surrounding regions, the
immigrant Apache groups constitute a strong cultural unit that requires special

Hughes m Prehistoric Cultural Developments

15

treatment. To the north and west of the Panhandle Plains and in the Panhandle
Plains, the resident Late Neoindian complexes apparently were being replaced by
these Apache groups during the 1300s and 1400s. In southwestern Kansas, these
groups are represented by the Dismal River aspect from about A.D. 1650 to 1750;
in southeastern Colorado, the Oklahoma Panhandle, northeastern New Mexico, and
the middle Pecos by as yet unassigned components after about A.D. 1300; in the
Texas Panhandle by a proposed Tierra Blanca complex after about A.D. 1400; and
in the South Plains by a proposed Garza complex after about A.D. 1500. By the start
of the 1700s the various Apache groups on and around the Texas High Plains were
being forced out by Comanches.
THE EARLY ARCHAIC SUBSTAGE
(About 5000 to 2000 B.C.)
For the Texas High Plains and bordering regions, the Early Archaic substage
is here defined as coinciding essentially with the Altithermal Long Drought and
characterized by a pattern of localized foraging for wild plant food and small game
replacing a pattern of unrestricted bison hunting, as evidenced by the disappearance
of bison kills, replacement of stemless lance points with stemmed dart points,
decreasing use of end scrapers, and increasing use of gouges, grinding implements,
hearth stones, and boiling pebbles. It should be noted that the Early Archaic thus
defined also corresponds essentially with Dillehay’s (1974) first period of bison
absence on the Southern Plains.
The Altithermal interval on the Texas High Plains, when not represented by a
wind- or water-scoured erosional unconformity, seems to be represented by
geological deposits (fluviatile, lacustrine, and eolian) that are remarkably devoid of
organic remains, including cultural materials. Any evidence of the above-mentioned
cultural developments--and indeed of any human presence at all--on the Texas
High Plains during the 3000-year span of the Long Drought is so scarce as to suggest
the possibility that the level uplands were largely abandoned in favor of the broken
country to the west, east, and south, where conditions may have been better suited
to a foraging existence. It should be pointed out, however, that although surface
evidence of early Archaic occupation appears to be much better in the breaks to the
west, and especially in the breaks to the east, than on the intervening uplands, except
for the Gore Pit site in the Rolling Plains of southwestern Oklahoma, it is only in the
Edwards Plateau to the southeast and in the lower Pecos to the south that any artifact
assemblages of this substage have been encountered in stratified deposits and dated
by radiocarbon.
The Gore Pit site is puzzling, however, in that a deeply buried assemblage of
features and artifacts dated at 5150, 4190, and 4066 B.C. includes a Meserve point
and Clear Fork gouges together with dart points identified elsewhere as Late
Archaic types. This seeming anachronism leads Hammatt (1976) to question the
utility of dart point styles for dating Archaic sites, but his illustrations suggest that
some of his typological identifications are questionable.

16

Texas Archeological Society

Only three kinds of evidence for human presence on the Texas High Plains
during the early Archaic substage appear to be available: 1) cultural remains that
have been radiocarbon dated between 5000 and 2000 B.C.; 2) dart points of types
that have been assigned to that time span in Central and southwestern Texas; and
3) Clear Fork gouges, which flourished during the Early Archaic, although they
started during Late Paleoindian times and may have lingered in some regions into
Late Archaic time.
It appears that the only cultural material on the Texas part of the Southern High
Plains to have been radiocarbon-dated for this interval so far is at the Lubbock Lake
site, where a date of 3010 B.C. has been reported for a large ash concentration
covered with caliche cobbles in Stafford’s (1981) Stratum 4. Just outside of Texas,
at the Clovis site, the Portales complex above the diatomite has been dated (on bone)
at 6230 and 6300 B.P., and stemmed and notched Archaic points in the upper jointed
sand have been dated (also on bone) at 4950 B.P. (Wendorf and Krieger 1959).
The only other radiocarbon dating of cultural remains to this interval that the
author has been able to find for the Southern High Plains is at the Pigeon Cliff site,
which is in New Mexico near the northwestern corner of the Texas Panhandle. At
this site a buried living surface labeled the Clayton Horizon yielded a Williams dart
point, a kni fe (retouched blade-flake), two end scrapers, a shallow firepit, and bones
of an extinct bison like those at the Plainview site (Steen 1976). Soil samples
impregnated with barely enough charcoal for dating produced a date of 8280 B.P.
for the firepit in 1955 and, in 1966, a date of 5420 B.P. for the firepit and a date of
6070 B.P. for the bone area.
The Pigeon Cliff findings constitute a puzzle that is not likely to be resolved.
Inadequate charcoal may explain the wide difference between the dates for the
firepit and bone area and the considerable difference between the dates for the
firepit and bone area in 1966--differences that suggest that all of the dates may be
unreliable. There is no ready explanation for the association of a supposedly Late
Archaic type of dart point with a supposedly late Pleistocene species of bison.
Dart point types (other than Paleoindian lanceolate types) that appear to be
older than 2000 B.C. in Central and southwestern Texas include Andice, Baird,
Baker, Bandy, Bell, Bulverde, "early barbed," Gower, Hoxie, Martindale, Nolan,
Pandale, Taylor, Tortugas, Travis, Uvalde, and Wells (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1981;
Mallouf 1985; Shafer 1989). In these two regions, some of these types have been
found associated with lanceolate points generally identified as Late Paleoindian in
deposits antedating 5000 B.C.; they have been regarded as "pre-Archaic" or "early
Archaic" by some writers, but are considered in this paper to be a notched form that
was developing during Late Paleoindian time. The difference has to do with
defining the Late Paleoindian/Early Archaic boundary: they place it at the first of
the notched points, whereas the author places it at the last of the lanceolate points.
Others solve the problem with a transitionalperiod for the time of overlap between
lanceolate and notched forms.
These terminological differences have not helped to simplify the complicated
problem of cross-dating between Central Texas, southwestern Texas, and the Texas

Hughes -- Prehistoric Cultural Developments

17

High Plains. It seems likely that Late Paleoindian~arly Archaic typological
developments on the Texas High Plains resembled some of the developments not
only in Central and southwestern Texas but also in other bordering regions; it seems
unlikely, however, that developments were identical in any of these regions. In other
words, the typology and chronology of one region cannot be transferred blindly to
another region. Although some of these point types that are known to be early in
Central and southwestern Texas have been reported occasionally as surface finds on
the Texas High Plains, only two specimens appear to have been found in controlled
excavations in the region.
At the Lubbock Lake site, Wheat (1974) found a Bulverde point in the upper
part of S tratum IVb or in the top of S tratum IVc. S tratum IV, which "forms the upper
limit of aboriginal occupation" (Wheat 1974:21), yielded three additional points,
however, that do not appear to be early: a Desmuke, an Ellis, and a Trinity. Holliday
(1977) and Stafford (1981) place Wheat’s finds near the top of their Stratum 4,
deposition of which ended at about 1000 B.P.
At the Marks Beach site, Honea (1980) found an "anomalous Frio-Uvalde like"
point (p. 267 and Figure 14c on p. 262) in his Zone IIIA. The overlying Zone IIIB
yielded two Marcos points with a variety of other cultural remains, and a well had
been dug from the base of the zone. Honea regards the entire Zone III as Archaic and
dating from the onset of the Altithermal, but the fact that the bones in Zone IIIA were
mineralized suggests the possibility that this zone is Late Paleoindian, that its upper
surface with the well may be an erosional unconformity representing the Altithermal,
and that the overlying Zone IIIB with the Marcos points is Late Archaic.
The possibility that Honea’s "Frio-Uvalde like" point is Paleoindian rather than
Archaic is strengthened by finds at the Clovis site, where a point that Honea regards
as similar was found under similar but much-better-dated conditions (Haynes and
Agogino 1966). Here a "notched Archaic" point (p. 817 and Figure 7 on p. 819) was
found on an erosional surface at the top of Unit E, 1.5 meters (5 feet) from a hearth
with charred bone that gave a date of 6520 B.C. This surface also produced Eden
and Scottsbluff points and showed many wells that had been dug into Unit E, the
upper part of which gave a date of 7940 B.C. The wells were filled with sand that
was regarded as dating to the Altithermal.
Excavations at the Rattlesnake Draw site on the Llano Estacado in southeastern
New Mexico produced one or two transitional points (Smith et al. 1966) that
resemble the Uvalde-like specimens at the Marks Beach and Clovis sites, as well as
one or two Paleoindian points, and also revealed a well that is interpreted as filled
with Altithermal sand, but the associations among these findings are not described.
The surface of the site yielded several of the transitional points together with a
variety of Paleoindian points. Meltzer and Collins (1987) have recently reviewed
the above-mentioned water wells on the S outhern High Plains as clues to Altithermal
climate.
It should be added that the Uvalde-like points excavated at the Marks Beach,
Clovis, and Rattlesnake Draw sites are at least vaguely reminiscent of the three
notched points found together with two lanceolate points (all with quasi-fluted

18

Texas Archeological Society

concave bases) among the skeletons of six extinct bison at the Rex Rodgers site in
the Mackenzie Reservoir (Willey et al. 1978). The bones gave a date of 7441 B.C.
A few reports of surface finds on the Texas High Plains have explicitly
identified some of the dart point types regarded as early in Central and southwestern
Texas: aBulverdeandaUvaldepointatasanddunesite(LY-4) nearTahoka (Riggs
1965); some Bulverde, Martindale, Travis, Tortugas, Uvalde, and Wells points in
a survey in the east central part of the Llano Estacado (Campbell and Judd 1977);
and a Martindale point at the Marks Beach site (Honea 1980).
Elsewhere on the Southern High Plains, Bulverde points have been identified
at two sites in east Central New Mexico (Wamica 1965); Nolan points at the Nail
site in the Oklahoma Panhandle (Baker et al. 1957); and Pandale and Travis points
at sites in southeastern Colorado (Campbell 1976). At the Johnson-Cline site in the
Oklahoma Panhandle, Lintz (1978a) regards four dart points (one Palmillas, one
Type D, and two Type E) as indicative of Early Archaic occupation, between 5000
and 1500 B.C. A great many published reports of surface finds on the Southern High
Plains describe and illustrate dart points that appear to represent some of the early
types, but, without access to the actual specimens, few of these points could be
assigned with any confidence to one type or another, especially considering the
primitive state of our typological understandings at present.
Although Clear Fork gouges are scarce on the Southern High Plains of
northwestern Texas and eastern New Mexico, they are common to the west in the
breaks of the upper Canadian and upper and middle Pecos, especially to the east in
the Rolling Plains drained by the Canadian, Red, and Brazos rivers (Hughes 1980),
to the southeast in the Edwards Plateau drained by the Brazos and Colorado rivers,
and to the south in the canyons of the lower Pecos River. It appears, however, that
these tools have been reported in excavated and dated deposits only in Central and
southwestern Texas, except for three exceptions noted below.
In Central Texas, Prewitt (1981) attributes gouges to all five of his 11 Archaic
phases that antedate 2000 B.C., including the oldest, his Circleville phase, dated at
6500 to 5000 B.C., the markers of which (Angostura, Golondrina, Meserve, and
Scottsbluff points) are generally regarded as Late Paleoindian. He also attributes
gouges, however, to one of his Late Archaic phases, the Twin Sisters, dated at A.D.
200 to 550, and to one of his "Neo-Archaic" phases, the Austin, dated at A.D. 700
to 1300. Are the late gouges truly gouges?
In southwestern Texas, on the lower Pecos, Shafer (1989) mentions gouges
with lanceolate and early stemmed points at about 9000 B.P., and in the eastern
trans-Pecos, Mallouf (1985) records them in his Early Transitional period at about
6000 to 4500 B.C. Outside Central and southwestern Texas, three reports of
excavated and dated gouges have been found. In the Rolling Plains of the southeastern Panhandle, Cruse (1989) recovered a gouge in S tratum 2b at the Kent Creek site,
with dates of A.D. 690 to 1010. In northeastern New Mexico, at the Old Coyote
rockshelter in Los Esteros Reservoir on the upper Pecos, Mobley (1978) has
reported five gouges from Stratum III, dated at A.D. 60 to 1096. As mentioned
earlier, an assemblage including gouges at the Gore Pit site in southwestern

Hughes ~ Prehistoric Cultural Developments

19

Oklahoma was dated at 5150, 4190, and 4066 B.C. Farther afield, Hughes (1980)
has called attention to the occurrence of gouges at two Late Paleoindian sites on the
northern fringes of the High Plains; the Allen site in Nebraska, and the Long site in
South Dakota.
It seems that gouges are indicative mainly of the Early Archaic, from about
5000 to 2000 B.C., but appeared somewhat earlier, in Late Paleoindian time, and in
some regions, may have lingered into Late Archaic and even into Neoindian times.
What is puzzling about the late occurrences reported for Central Texas and
northeastern New Mexico, however, is that scores of excavations in late components in the regions where gouges occur have failed to produce any of these tools.
One wonders if the few seemingly late occurrences are intrusions from earlier
cultures, like the occasional occurrences of Paleoindian points in more recent sites.
The only reported excavation of gouges from a site on the Southern High Plains
that the author has been able to find is at the Blue Clay site in Mackenzie Reservoir
in Tule Canyon (Willey et al. 1978). This was a small, open campsite with projectile
points, indicating multiple occupations during Late Archaic and Neoindian times.
Two gouges were found in the top 15 cm (6 inches) of the deposits.
S urface finds of the gouges have been reported at a few other place on the Texas
High Plains. These finds include two gouges at the Little Sunday site on the rim of
Palo Duro Canyon, where dart point types indicate a mainly Late Archaic occupation, although a Folsom point was also found (Hughes 1955); one gouge in the lower
Tule Canyon (Katz and Katz 1976); two gouges in the South Plains Archeological
Reconaissance area in the east Central part of the Llano Estacado (Campbell and
Judd 1977); one gouge in the Red Deer Creek valley in the northeastern part of the
Panhandle (Hughes et al. 1978); and one gouge in the Palo Duro Creek valley in the
North Central part of the Panhandle (Hughes 1979).
Gouges are also seldom reported on the Southern High Plains outside of Texas.
In southeastern New Mexico, one of the tools illustrated in a report on the
Rattlesnake Draw site resembles a gouge (Smith et al. 1966:Plate VI, No. 18). In the
Oklahoma Panhandle, in a survey of Black Mesa State Park (Saunders 1978), four
gouges were found: one with Archaic, two with Woodland, and one with Village
associations. In addition to the reported finds of gouges on the Texas High Plains,
the author recalls a few rare findings of gouges in the Palo Duro Canyon part of the
eastern Caprock Escarpment, in the Canadian breaks across the Panhandle, and one
in a playa basin in Amarillo’s Southeast Park (Hughes 1980).
From the foregoing review of what little evidence has been produced for
ctfltural developments on the Texas High Plains during Early Archaic time, after
several decades of archeological search it can be inferred that the region was
generally so unattractive during the 3000-year span of the Altithermal Long
Drought as to minimize human utilization. Geographic distribution of the scanty
evidence available, in the form of dated remains, early dart points, and Clear Fork
gouges, suggests that the playa basins and stream valleys on the uplands were
seldom visited, and that even the sheltered, spring-fed canyons along the Caprock
escarpment and in the Canadian breaks across the Panhandle Plains were only

20

Texas Archeological Society

lightly occupied. It may also be predicted that information on the Early Archaic
lifestyles on the Southern High Plains in general will come much more slowly and
be harder to acquire than in some of the bordering regions, and that as the evidence
accumulates, cultural differences from north to south and from east to west on the
High Plains will be found to reflect the differences among the Early Archaic cultures
in the bordering regions.
The Middle Archaic of Central Texas, characterized by Pedemales dart points
and associated artifacts, is almost absent from the Llano Estacado. Interestingly, in
Central Texas there appears to be a general increase in population in this same time
period (Prewitt 1981; Brown 1989).
THE LATE ARCHAIC
(About 2000 B.C. to A.D. 200.)
The Late Archaic substage on the Texas High Plains is defined as starting at
about 2000 B.C. with the beginning of Medithermal (modem) climatic conditions
in the region. This substage is marked primarily by the use of various kinds of barbed
dart points for hunting bison and other large game. The terminal date of about A.D.
200 is an arbitrary figure that splits the difference between about A.D. 1 and A.D.
400 or 500. Barbed arrowpoints and Woodland cord-marked and Mogollon brownware pottery may have appeared on the Texas High Plains as early as the time of
Christ, whereas barbed dart points seem to have continued in use alongside of these
innovations and to have been used in bison kills, until about A.D. 400 or 500 (see
Lintz et al. 1991, this volume). Archeological remains that are dated within or near
the 2000 B.C. to A.D. 200 span, or that include dart points of types supposedly used
during this span, are assigned to the Late Archaic substage.
In contrast to the Early Archaic on the Texas High Plains, the Late Archaic is
represented by thousands of sites of various kinds, many with quantities of features
and artifacts that demonstrate the presence of many groups of foragers who had
achieved a high degree of effectiveness at making a living by hunting and gathering.
Late Archaic components are not only far more numerous than Early Archaic (and
Paleoindian) components, but also appear to be about as numerous as Neoindian
components.
Despite this wealth of evidence, however, Late Archaic manifestations have
received much less attention than have the more intriguing Paleoindian sites and the
more prolific Neoindian sites. Although hundreds of Late Archaic components have
been recorded (but not reported) in ongoing survey programs and reported in special
survey projects on the Texas and adjoining parts of the Southern High Plains, only
a few dozen of these components have been encountered in excavations, and no
more than two or three dozen of these tested components have been reported. Many,
if not most, of the reported surface manifestations have an admixture of later
materials (the Little Sunday site (Hughes 1955) appears to be one of the rare
exceptions); and very few of the reported subsurface findings provide data on a
discrete, ample, and dated assemblage (the lower midden at the Chalk Hollow site
(Wedel 1975) is one of the best of these).

Hughes m Prehistoric Cultural Developments

21

Pitifully few of the Late Archaic components on the Southern High Plains have
been radiocarbon dated. Three of these are in the Palo Duro Canyon area. At the
Canyon City Club Cave, the lowermost Level 5 produced no diagnostic items but
was dated at 880 and 150 B.C.; the overlying Level 4 contained transitional Late
Archaic-Early Neoindian remains, including dart points like Ellis and Lange, and
was dated at A.D. 300 and 680 (Hughes 1969; Duffield 1970). At the Chalk Hollow
site, the lower midden produced dart points like Castroville, Marcos, Palmillas, and
Williams and was dated at 1650 to 400 B.C. (Wedel 1975). At the Deadman’s
shelter, the lowermost S tratum D contained transitional Late Archaic-Early Neoindian
remains, including dart points like Edgewood, Elam or Kent, Ellis, and Lange, and
was dated at A.D. 120 and 210 (Willey and Hughes 1978). Several Late Archaic
dates have been reported for the Lubbock Lake site (Johnson and Holliday 1986;
Johnson 1987; Lintz et al. 1991, this volume). In southeastern Colorado at the
Medina rockshelter a Late Archaic component was dated at 20 B.C. (Campbell
1976),
In the eastern part of the Texas Panhandle, a series of Late Archaic bison kills
located on the High Plains and the Rolling Plains below have yielded dart points like
Ellis, Marcos, Palmillas, and Williams, and radiocarbon dates falling mainly in the
A.D. 1 to 500 range (D. Hughes 1977). No cultural complexes have been identified
for the Late Archaic on the Southern High Plains and defined as to cultural content
and affiliations, spatial range, and temporal span. The author (1955) has suggested
that a Little Sunday complex be postulated to account for the remains at that site,
but the complex cannot be defined until the site has been explored and compared
with others in the Panhandle Plains. Late Archaic components in the southwestern
part of the S outh Plains have been assigned by Corley (1965) and others to the Hueco
phase that Lehmer (1948) proposed for preceramic remains in the Jornada area of
the Mogollon culture. However, whether all of the Late Archaic remains throughout
the widespread eastern, northern, and southern districts of the Jornada Mogollon are
similar enough to constitute a single complex is a question that does not yet seem
to have been fully addressed. Although dart points in Late Archaic components on
the South Plains have sometimes been attributed to the Edwards Plateau aspect of
Central Texas and the Pecos River and Chisos foci of southwestern Texas, no one
seems to have assigned an entire component to any of these complexes.
Late Archaic sites on the Southern High Plains represent a wide variety of
functions and are found in a wide variety of locations. Most of the sites are open
camps that were briefly occupied by small groups. Some of the sites appear to have
been occupied repeatedly or protractedly by sizeable groups and were probably base
camps. The open camps are usually near a water supply, around the playa basins and
along the stream valleys on the uplands, and in the canyons that cut the margins of
the High Plains and drain the Canadian breaks. The base camps tend to be near
permanent sources of good water, and some of the best are in sheltered places in the
canyons, around headsprings and pouroffpools. High places were used as lookouts,
and wherever rock overhangs afforded any protection from the weather, they were
used as shelters. Quarries and workshops are located at outcrops of Alibates agate,

22

Tecovas jasper, Dakota quartzite, Edwards chert, and Ogallala chalcedony, and
gravel beds of all ages were prospected for lithic materials. Bison kills were made
in arroyo traps, especially in the Red River drainage along the eastern fringes of the
Panhandle Plains. Some of the rock carvings in the shelters and on the cliffs around
the High Plains probably date to Late Archaic time.
Various kinds of features characterize Late Archaic camps. Little or no
evidence of dwellings or other structures has been found, but fires are usually
evidenced by clusters and scatters of pieces of burned caliche, quartzite pebbles,
sandstone slabs, and sometimes by patches of baked earth, charred wood or bone,
soot, and ash. Slab-lined pit, basin, and level hearths are sometimes preserved. The
various kinds of hearths and other evidence of heating and cooking doubtless have
important chronological as well as functional implications that await exploration.
Layers of burned rocks are found at some of the sites, but burned rock middens like
those of Central Texas and ring middens like those of southwestern Texas seem to
be absent. In addition to hearth areas, features at some of the sites include supplies
and dumps of boiling pebbles, chipping stations, caches of raw materials, pockets
of waste flakes, refuse deposits, caches of grinding slabs, bedrock mortars, and
burials.
The mortar holes, usually deep and tapered cylindrical or elliptical ~orrester
1991, this issue) are sometimes clustered in large numbers on talus boulders or on
bedrock ledges. The burials tend to be in the foetal position under a few slabs at the
bottoms of small, shallow, oval graves, usually devoid of diagnostic artifacts but
sometimes with a few personal possessions. Although few of these burials have
been reported, a great many have been found both in and away from camps. The
skulls tend to be long and low, with low foreheads and strong brow ridges; the teeth
are much worn from eating stone-ground food, and are sometimes grooved or
notched (Willey 1978; Willey and Ubelaker 1976).
Late Archaic assemblages on the Southern High Plains include many different
kinds of dart points and a considerable variety of other artifacts. The dart points are
potentially among the most useful of the artifact classes, and as their typology
becomes better understood, they should prove to be very helpful, not only for dating
High Plains sites, but also for tracing connections with adjoining regions. Most
writers who have attempted to fit High Plains dart points into the Texas typology,
however, have found that their specimens seldom fall neatly into one type or
another. The High Plains specimens are often smaller than their counterparts in
Central Texas, where many of the types were established and where the Edwards
chert is a more abundant and tractable material than the materials generally
available on the High Plains.
Of the more-than-two-dozen dartpoint types thathave been explicitly identified
in a Late Archaic context on the High Plains by various writers, the types that seem
to be mentioned most frequently resemble what Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954)
called Edgewood, Ellis, Marcos, and Palmillas, followed by Ensor, Trinity, Williams,
and Lange. These are mainly North Texas and Central Texas forms. They are also
common in Oklahoma (Chris Lintz, personal communication). Influences from

Hughes m Prehistoric Cultural Developments

23

other directions are suggested by mentions of Duncan and Hanna points to the north,
Augustin and Pinto Basin to the west, and Langtry and Paisano to the south.
There is some evidence from a few sites on the High Plains, sometimes agreeing
with evidence from Central and southwestern Texas, that earlier dart point types
during the Late Archaic substage include Castroville, Marcos, Marshall, Palmillas,
and Williams, whereas later types include Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, Ensor, Kent,
Lange, and Trinity. Most of the earlier types are notably larger, broader, and more
strongly barbed than the later types.
Most of the High Plains dart points are made of various local materials, but
occasional specimens made of exotic material evidently were imported from fairly
remote sources--hornfels from northeastern New Mexico, Niobrara jasper from
northwestern Kansas, Florence chert from North Central Oklahoma, and Edwards
chert from Central Texas (although the last is also available in places along the
southeast edges of the Llano Estacado). Obsidian from central New Mexico is rare
to nonexistent in Late Archaic assemblages on the High Plains.
Chipped stone artifacts other than dart points found in Late Archaic components
on the Southern High Plains include an abundance of knives (large, thin, triangularto-ovate bifaces, usually fragmentary); key-shaped drills; crude bifaces (possibly
preforms for points and knives); bifacial and unifacial choppers; many and varied
scrapers (large end scrapers, small side scrapers, spokeshaves, discs, turtle-backs,
retouched flakes and flake fragments); and gravers and denticulates. Chipping
technology as indicated by cores and flakes has yet to receive much attention.
Hammerstones include large cobble pounders and small discoidal knappers.
Grinding implements are abundant; metates are thin sandstone slabs with unshaped
or partially shaped edges and shallow oval basins pecked and worn on one or both
faces; the one-hand manos are small, unshaped or partially shaped quartzite or
sandstone cobbles pecked and worn on one or both faces; they are round to subrectangular in outline and flat, convex, or wedge shaped in cross section.. Other stone
items include grooved sandstone awl sharpeners, worn and scratched pieces of
paintstone, and rare stone beads and pendants.
Scarce bone artifacts include awls of split deer cannon bone, flaking tools,
gaming pieces, beads, and pendants. Food remains include bones of both large and
small game animals. Some information on bison slaughtering and butchering
techniques is available (D. Hughes 1977). Shell items are rare; disc, tubular, and
Olivella beads and mussel and conch pendants have been reported.
To recap Late Archaic cultural developments on the Southern High Plains, it
appears that Indian groups who had developed typical Archaic foraging efficiency
during the Altithermal in surrounding regions less hostile than the High Plains
grasslands began to return to the region with the onset of modem Medithermal
climate and to redevelop bison-hunting skills reminiscent of their Paleoindian
predecessors. Weapons, tools, faunal remains, and grinding implements indicate
extensive exploitation of available food resources--game animals both large and
small as well as wild plants--but most details remain to be explored.

The evidence for a gathering and hunting subsistence, the presence of brief
camps wherever water was available, the location of base camps in the ecotonal
scarps and breaks around and across the High Plains, and the heavy use of local lithic
resources all are suggestive of seasonal rounds within limited territories. Occasional
dart points of flints from remote sources, however, suggest some fast and far travel
by hunting parties, and rare marine shells indicate some trade in coastal directions.
Except for some changes in dart point styles, the technological developments
during the two millennia of Late Archaic life on the High Plains are still unknown.
Work in bone and shell seems to have been minimal compared with stone, but the
lack of perishable organic materials in the artifact inventory is more likely a
reflection of the scarcity of dry cave deposits on and around the High Plains. Animal
and plant materials probably were at least as important as stone. It seems likely that
the Late Archaic cultures were so well adapted to the region that technological and
other changes during the period were minimal, but it would not be surprising to find
evidence that climatic fluctuations induced some cultural responses, such as a mesic
interval at about 500 B.C. promoting more bison and more kills.
With regard to social organization, it may be speculated that Late Archaic
people on the High Plains, like most of the world’s foragers, lived most of the year
in small patrilineal, extended family groups under the leadership of a headman,
temporarily joining other groups only on special occasions. Interests beyond
survival are barely hinted at in the form of rare gaming pieces, beads and pendants,
paintstones, petroglyphs, and burials in the foetal position under protective slabs.
THE EARLY NEOINDIAN SUBSTAGE
(About A.D. 200 to 1100)
The Early Neoindian substage era on the Texas High Plains is defined as
starting about A.D. 200 (between about A.D. 1 and 400 or 500) with the appearance
of barbed arrowpoints and Woodland cordmarked and/or Mogollon brownware
pottery; these are the chief diagnostic artifacts of the substage. The terminal date of
about A.D. 1100 splits the difference between about A.D. 1000, when a Woodland/
Village transition was taking place in the northern part of the Panhandle Plains, and
about A.D. 1200, when a pit-to-surface-house transition was taking place on the
southwestern part of the South Plains. As will be seen later, the transition in both
areas was marked, not only by changes in house ty~es, but also by a shift from barbed
arrowpoints to side-notched triangular arrowpoints, and by many other developments.
The Early Neoindian substage on the Southern High Plains seems to have been
a time when some of the Late Archaic foraging groups who had been hunting and
gathering in the region for more than 2000 years without much change began to add
some potentially revolutionary new ideas to the cultural inventory--the bow and
arrow, pottery, pit houses, and doubtless some gardening or horticulture. Under
influences from the Mogollon tradition to the southwest and the Woodland tradition
to the northeast, they began a transformation from a nomadic camper-forager
existence toward a sedentary villager-gardener lifestyle. The bulk of the items in the

Hughes ~ Prehistoric Cultural Developments

25

Late Archaic assemblages continue on into the Early Neoindian assemblages,
suggesting that the innovations represent mainly influxes of new ideas rather than
new peoples. The extent to which collecting of wild plant food in the Late Archaic
may have been preadaptive to the acceptance of horticultural ideas is an interesting
matter for speculation.
On the Texas part of the Southern High Plains, three Early Neoindian complexes have been recognized. In the Panhandle Plains, a Lake Creek complex is
found mainly in the Canadian breaks and northward, with some extension southward into the northern part of the Red River drainage, whereas a Palo Duro complex
is found mainly in the Red River drainage and northward into the Canadian breaks
and somewhat beyond. In the southwestern part of the South Plains, a sequence of
two Early Neoindian phases (Querecho and Maljamar) occurs mainly in southeastern New Mexico but is well represented eastward into Texas.
The Lake Creek Complex
This complex was first identified on the basis of test excavations at a site on
Lake Creek, a north-side tributary of the Canadian River in Hutchinson County
(Hughes 1962). The complex is characterized primarily by a combination of
Woodland cordmarked pottery with Sca!lom-like arrowpoints, often accompanied
by Mogollon plain brownware.
The Lake Creek complex has been tested and reported at eight or nine sites and
tested but unreported at several others. S urface surveys have identified the complex
at several dozen sites, a few of which are described in various survey reports. Sadly,
there are no radiocarbon dates for any of these components, but a Woodland sherd
at the Tascosa Creek site near Old Tascosa (now Cal Farley’s Boys Ranch) has been
dated by thermoluminescence at A.D. 520 (Couzzourt 1985, 1988). Radiocarbon
dates at several Woodland sites in western Oklahoma and a couple in southeastern
Colorado indicate a span of about A.D. 200 to 800 or 900.
Most of the known components of the Lake Creek complex are open camps on
terraces along the Canadian River and its tributary creeks, usually in buried soil
zones. Very little material is exposed at most sites, but some are extensive and rich
enough to represent base camps. Features at the sites are little known; a possible
dwelling at one site is yet to be exposed. Rock hearths are seldom well preserved.
Refuse deposits are composed mainly of hearth stones, boiling pebbles, waste
flakes, and animal bones. Bison bones are scarce at most sites, lending some
credence to Dillehay’s postulated Bison Absence Period II (A.D. 500 to 1200 or
1300). Human skeletal remains at three or foar sites, and a few isolated burials with
Scaltorn-like points, indicate flexed burials, sometimes accompanied by a few
personal tools and ornaments.
The diagnostic pottery is typical Plains Woodland ware. It is seldom abundant,
usually consisting of a few big thick fragments of large conoidal vessels, tempered
with liberal quantities of coarse particles of crushed rock and/or bone (in the
northeastern Panhandle the rock is often scoria from pebbles in the Ogallala
Formation), and boldly impressed with long parallel cordmarks. A few sherds of

26

Texas Archeological Society

Mogollon brownware are sometimes present, generally large thick pieces resembling
Alma Plain, an early type with a smooth finish and dark paste speckled with whitish
angular cleavage fragments of crushed plagioclase feldspar.
Most of the projectile points are small Scallorn-like arrowpoints, but other
kinds of corner-notched arrowpoints are also found together with occasional
specimens ranging from Ellis-like corner-notched dart points to Reed-like sidenotched arrowpoints. The rest of the artifact inventory appears to be basically
similar to the Late Archaic inventory, but future studies may be expected to reveal
some significant differences. Grinding implements are impressively abundant at
some sites.
The Palo Duro Complex
This complex was first identified on the basis of test excavations at the
Deadman’s shelter in Mackenzie Reservoir on Tule Canyon, a major tributary of
Palo Duro Canyon (WiUey and Hughes 1978). The complex has been much further
defined on the basis of excavations at the Kent Creek site in Hall County near
Turkey, Texas (Cruse 1989). The complex is characterized primarily by a combination of Mogollon plain brown pottery with a distinctive arrowpoint type called
Deadman, often accompanied by Scallorn-like arrowpoints.
The Palo Duro complex has been tested and reported at a half a dozen sites and
has been found in unreported tests at several others. A great many components have
been described in survey reports, and dozens of others have been recorded but not
published. Unlike the Lake Creek complex, radiocarbon dates have been obtained
for several components of the Palo Duro Complex: A.D. 300 to 680 for Level 4 at
the Canyon City Club Cave (Hughes 1969); A.D. 370 to 870 for the upper midden
at the Chalk Hollow site (Wedel 1975); A.D. 120 to 710 at the Deadman’s shelter
(Willey and Hughes 1978); A.D. 690 to 1010 at the Kent Creek site (Cruse 1989);
and A.D. 815 to 1110 at the Blue Spring shelter (unreported). These dates suggest
that the Palo Duro complex spans most of the first millennium A.D.
Sites of the Palo Duro complex seem to occur at a wider variety of locations than
do those of the Lake Creek complex. The Palo Duro sites are found mainly in the
broken country in the upperRed River drainage, but they are also found in the breaks
of the Canadian River, along the valleys and canyons, on high places and low, in
exposed areas, sheltered areas, and rock overhangs, near and sometimes not so near
water. Some large, deep, and rich components probably represent base camps.
Except for Mogollon-style pithouses at the Kent Creek site (Cruse 1989), and
probably at another site near B uffalo Lake (Hays 1986), features at the sites, insofar
as they are known, do not seem to differ appreciably from those at the Lake Creek
sites. Both rock-lined and unlined fireplaces have been found. Bison bones are
scarce to nonexistent in the middens. The few burials referable to the complex are
flexed, with some personal possessions, like the burials of the Lake Creek complex.
Artifact assemblages are also similar, except for the peculiar Deadman arrowpoints that are diagnostic of the Palo Duro complex. These points are deeply notched
from the base so as to produce long slender stems and equally long slender barbs.

Hughes u Prehistoric Cultural Developments

27

Complete specimens are rare; the fragile stems and barbs that survived the notching
process have seldom escaped postmanufacturing breakage. The points are usually
accompanied by distinctive thin, ovate preforms. Deadman points are reminiscent
of other long-stemmed arrowpoints in Texas--not only the early Alba and Bonham
types of eastern and North Central Texas, but also the late Perdiz and Livermore
types of Central and western Texas. As with Lake Creek components, Palo Duro
components usually have a few sherds of Mogollon brownware resembling the
early Alma Plain type. The sherds often have repair holes, suggesting that the
imported vessels were highly regarded and reluctantly abandoned.
The Palo Duro complex may represent groups of nomadic foragers who were
based in the upper Red River drainage, but who served as intermediaries between
Mogollon groups to the southwest on the Pecos River and the Rio Grande and
Woodland groups to the north on the Canadian River. If so, they may have carried
more important, but less tangible, items than Mogollon pots, such as ideas about
houses and horticulture.
Faunal evidence from some of the Palo Duro components, together with the
buried soil zones containing some of the Lake Creek components, suggests that
Panhandle climate may have been moister around the middle of the first millennium
A.D. than it is today. The Palo Duro levels at the Canyon City Club cave, the Blue
Spring shelter, and the Deadman’s shelter all have yielded remains of the prairie
vole (Microtus ochrogaster), which no longer lives in the Panhandle, preferring the
moister regions to the east.
The Querecho-Maljamar Phases
On the basis of test excavations at several sites on the South Plains in
southeastern New Mexico and surface collections at many others, Corley (1965)
proposed an eastern extension of the Jornada branch of the Mogollon culture with
a sequence of Querecho, Maljamar, and Ochoa phases. Tested sites included Boot
Hill (Corley and Leslie 1960) and Merchant (Leslie 1965). Since 1965, components
of the Eastern Jornada phases have been reported in excavations at several other
sites, not only in southeastern New Mexico, but also at the Andrews Lake sites in
Texas (Collins 1966, 1968) and are recognizable in excavation and survey reports
at many other sites in the Texas part of the South Plains.
According to Corley (1965) and Collins (1966, 1968, 1971), the Querecho
phase, which is thought to have evolved out of a local version of the Late Archaic
Jornada-wide Hueco phase, is dated at A.D. 950 to 1100, and is characterized by
sites without houses, a locally made plain brownware, a few kinds of intrusive
wares, corner-notched arrowpoints, and, until A.D. 1000, some small dart points.
(It should be noted that Querecho is an unfortunate label for a phase that is unrelated
to the Querechos encountered by Coronado in 1541.) The Maljamar phase is dated
at A.D. 1100 to 1300, and is characterized by pithouses, locally made plain and
corrugated brown wares, more kinds of intrusive wares, corner-notched arrowpoints until A.D. 1200, and side-notched triangular arrowpoints thereafter. The
Ochoa phase is dated at A.D. 1300 to 1450, and is characterized by jacallike surface

28

Texas Archeological Society

houses with rock and adobe foundations, locally made Ochoa Indented Brown
Ware, still more kinds of intrusive wares, and side-notched triangular arrowpoints.
In this Eastem Jomada sequenc e, the Querecho phase clearly is Early Neoindian.
The Maljamar phase appears to represent a transition from Early to Late Neoindian,
with a shift from comer-notched to side-notched arrowpoints in the middle of the
phase (at about A.D. 1200), and shifts from pit to surface houses and from local plain
and corrugated brownware to local indented brownware at the end of the phase
(about A.D. 1300).
All of the dates for the Eastern Jornada sequence are estimates based on various
intrusive types of earlier Mogollon and later Anasazi pottery 0~unyan and Hedrick
1987). Ages of some of the types--especially the earlier Mogollon types--are
merely estimates in themselves, and one wishes for some direct radiocarbon dating
of the Eastern Jomada manifestations. Although events in the Eastern Jomada
region did not necessarily occur at the same time as similar events in surrounding
regions, comparisons suggest that some of the estimates for the Eastern Jomada may
be a bit late. In the middle Pecos region (Jelinek 1967), the ceramic sequence has
been dated from A.D. 900 to 1300 rather than A.D. 950 to 1450, although the
replacement of comer-notched arrowpoints with the side-notched arrowpoints has
been dated at the same time (A.D. 1200) as in the Eastern Jomada sequence. The
ceramic sequence in the Guadalupe Mountains ~helps 1974) has been dated from
A.D. 850 to 1350. In the Hueco Basin beyond the Guadalupes (Whalen 1981), the
ceramic sequence has been dated from A.D. 1 to 1400, with a much earlier starting
date and with surface houses replacing pithouses between A.D. 1100 and 1200,
rather than at A.D. 1300 as in the Eastern Jomada. Finally, it is curious that
brownwares from the Mogollon seem to have reached the Panhandle Plains several
centuries earlier (about A.D. 200) than they reached the South Plains (about A.D.
950).
Since no evidence of horticulture has been found at Eastern Jomada sites, it has
been suggested (Collins 1971) that these sites represent people who managed to turn
a Late Archaic foraging existence under influences from Jornada Mogollon cultures
to the west, into a semisedentary lifestyle with villages and pottery, centered on the
spring-fed draws and playas of the southwestern Llano Estacado and based mainly
on hunting buffalo and gathering acorns. Collins notes, however, that in the Eastem
Jomada sequence (Jelinek 1967), bison were scarce during the earlier phases, until
about A.D. 1200. This accords well with the evidence from the Panhandle Plains and
from the Southern Plains in general (Dillehay 1974).
From the Red River drainage southward across the drainages of the Brazos and
Colorado rivers, along the eastern and southern margins and the uplands of the
Llano Estacado, at least a dozen tested and reported sites (and many reported but
untested sites) have yielded Scallom-like arrowpoints, sometimes without pottery
but usually with Mogollon plain brownwares that may be early, and occasionally
with painted types that are known to be early. Unfortunately, these Early Neoindian
materials are almost always mixed with later types of points and pottery and lack
radiocarbon dates. These components appear to represent the spread of Querecho-

Hughes m Prehistoric Cultural Developments

29

Maljamar influences entirely across the South Plains at an early date. (Perhaps Qu6
Mal would be an appropriate name for the complex!)
Along the western edge of the Southern High Plains, in eastern New Mexico,
the combination of corner-notched arrowpoints and plain brownware pottery
extends all the way up the Pecos Valley and across the low divide into the upper
Canadian drainage. In the Brantley Reservoir area below Carlsbad, Henderson
(1976) reports the combination in some of the 35 sites he assigns to his Ceramic
Period, which he estimates as starting at about A.D. 900. In the middle Pecos area
below Fort Sumner, Jelinek (1967) recorded 64 sites and found the combination in
the sites that he assigns to his 18 Mile and Mesita Negra phases, dating from A.D.
900 to 1200. In the Los Esteros Reservoir area above Santa Rosa, Mobley (1978)
found the combination in several sites that he assigns to his Pueblo Period, dating
from A.D. 900 to 1300. These include three tested and radiocarbon dated components: Stratum IIIA at Old Coyote shelter, dated earlier than A.D. 1096; Stratum II
at Helter shelter dated at A.D. 1158; and the Spillway site, dated at A.D. 1074 and
A.D. 1141. In the upper Canadian drainage, the combination was reported by
Roberts (1942) in the top level at the San Jon site; by Dick (1953) in one of two rock
shelters at the Hodges site near Tucumcari; and by Hammack (1965) at three sites
in the Ute Reservoir area north of Tucumcari, including the top Level 1 at site
LA5573.
From the above review, it is now apparent that during the Early Neoindian
substage, Scallorn-like and other barbed arrowpoints blanketed the entire Southem
High Plains and bordering areas and that the Canadian River breaks were the
meeting ground for Woodland cordmarked pottery from the north and Mogollon
plain brown ware from the south, and perhaps for the exchange of important ideas
between the bearers of these two radically different ceramic traditions of widely
separated origins.
LATE NEOINDIAN
(About A.D. 1100 to 1541)
The phase of the Late Neoindian on the Texas High Plains is defined as starting
at about A.D. 1100 with the appearance of side-notched triangular arrowpoints
(Washita, Harrell), which together with other triangular arrowpoints (Fresno),
become the principal diagnostic artifacts of the substage. As indicated previously,
the initial date of about A.D. 1100 splits the difference between about A.D. 1000,
when a Woodland/Village transition was underway in the northern part of the
Panhandle Plains, and about A.D. 1200, when a pit-to-surface-house transition was
underway in the southwestern part of the South Plains.
In the Panhandle Plains, the Woodland-Village transition involved not only a
shift from barbed arrowpoints to side-notched triangular arrowpoints, but also many
more important if less diagnostic changes, including expanded bison hunting and
corn-bean-squash horticulture, growing populations in many homesteads, hamlets,
and villages, increasing complexity in architecture and in stone, bone, shell, and
ceramic technology, intensified exploitation of the Alibates agate quarries, and a

30

Texas Archeological Society

growing trade network, especially with the Anasazi pueblos of northem New
Mexico.
In the South Plains, the shift from comer-notched arrowpoints to side-notched
triangular arrowpoints, and from pithouses to surface houses, seems to have been
accompanied by similar but somewhat less spectacular changes, including increased bison hunting, more numerous villages with more numerous and complex
structures, some technological innovations, and more Anasazi as well as Mogollon
trade.
Although the arrival of the Coronado expedition on the High Plains in 1541
may mark the beginning of the historic stage, this event is more an arbitrary than a
real terminus for the Late Neoindian substage of cultural development, which did
not really end until the acquisition of horses by the Plains Indians in the late 1600s
initiated what was perhaps the greatest cultural revolution in their long history--the
Historic stage.
The small, thin, sharp, side-notched triangular arrowpoint seems to be a
perfected bison-killing point designed for quick manufacture, damage resistance,
and deep penetration; it is less significant in itself than as a readily recognizable
signal of the renewed importance of bison hunting on the Texas High Plains. It
seems to have come out of the northwestern Great Plains (Kehoe 1966) and to have
been moving southward down the Southern High Plains from about A.D. 1000 in
the north to about A.D. 1200 in the south, perhaps together with the returning bison,
and only a century or two ahead of various Apache groups who were following the
bison herds southward.
The triangular arrowpoint seems to have been accompanied on its southward
journey by the lozenge-shaped Harahey knife with its four alternately beveled
cutting edges, which appears to be a perfected bison skinning and butchering knife
designed for prolonged use before having to be resharpened (Sollberger 1971).
At least four main complexes are recognizable on the Texas High Plains during
the Late Neoindian substage: in the Panhandle Plains, the Antelope Creek focus of
the Plains Village tradition, followed by a proposed Tierra Blanca complex
representing an Apache group; and in the South Plains, the Ochoa phase of the
Eastern Jomada sequence, followed by the Garza complex, which appears to
represent another Apache group. A fifth complex has recently been postulated in the
northeastern Panhandle--the Buried City complex (D. Hughes 1987, 1989).
The Antelope Creek Focus
Although a great deal remains to be learned about this complex, it is much better
known than any other complex on the Texas High Plains and has been described so
thoroughly and summarized so frequently that it will be given only minimal
consideration in this paper.
The type site of this complex was on Antelope Creek, a south-side tributary of
the Canadian River in Hutchinson County, in the oil fields between Fritch and
Borger (Krieger 1946). A few years ago the extensive ruins were almost totally
wiped out with a pass or two by a curious bulldozer operator during a lunch break

Hughes ~ Prehistoric Cultural Developments

31

from work on a nearby pipeline project. The Antelope Creek focus is marked by an
association of many distinctive traits, including slab-house ruins, Borger Cordmarked pottery, triangular Washita, Harrell, and Fresno arrowpoints, "guitar-pick"
arrowpoint preforms, large, oval-to-lozenge-shaped beveled knives, flake-base
drills, large, thin end scrapers, big, thick grinding slabs with deep, oval basins, bison
tibia, scapula, and rib tools, and mussel shell scrapers, among many other characteristic artifacts.
Hundreds of Antelope Creek components have been recorded, and many of
these have been described in survey reports; nearly all of the sites have been
vandalized, often beyond salvation. Scores of sites have been tested, and dozens of
these have been described in excavation reports; few of the reports are scientifically
adequate. Antelope Creek components are concentrated mainly in the Canadian
breaks in the central part of the Texas Panhandle, but they are found at many other
places in the Panhandle Plains, southward into the Red River drainage, westward
into northeastern New Mexico, northward into the Oklahoma Panhandle, where
similar remains have been assigned to the Optima focus (Watson 1950), and
eastward toward the edges of the High Plains, where they mingle with components
of the Washita River focus in the eastem Texas Panhandle.
A great many Antelope Creek components have been dated by radiocarbon
analyses and by Anasazi trade pottery. The dates range from the 1100s into the
1500s with most of them falling between A.D. 1200 and 1450, the dates usually
given for the focus (Baerreis and Bryson 1965; Lintz 1978b).
Most of the Antelope Creek sites are slab-house ruins at isolated homesteads,
small hamlets, and large villages. The ruins are found mainly in the Canadian
breaks, where the sites are so dense that when they were inhabited, the smoke of
several neighboring settlements would have been visible from most of the settlements, but the ruins are known as far south as the Tule Canyon in Briscoe County.
Some of the sites appear to be hunting camps, in the open and in rockshelters, and
at least one of the open camps, as far south as the Little Red River in Briscoe County,
is associated with a bison kill. Most of the hundreds of quarry pits at the well-known
Alibates quarries, which are surrounded by large mining, manufacturing, and
trading villages of the Antelope Creek focus, doubtless were dug by these people.
The ruins of the Antelope Creek settlements are found in many kinds of
locations--along rivers and creeks, around headsprings and pouroff pools, in
canyons and valleys, sometimes on highly defensible mesas and buttes (later,
Apache-period fortresses?), but more often on indefensible ridges, bluffs, benches,
and terraces (earlier, pre-Apache habitations?). Antelope Creek ruins may comprise
from one to scores of structures. The dwellings generally were beautifully designed
for serving environmental and social needs with available materials and technology.
Many of the structures are large, rectangular, semisubterranean houses with vertical
slabs lining the walls of the excavation, an east-west traffic channel with a central
firepit surrounded by holes for four roof-support posts, wide benches along both
sides of the channel for working and sleeping, a household altar bench or niche at
the west end of the channel, a slab-lined entry tunnel at the east end of the channel,

small storage rooms adjoining the tunnel, large bell-shaped storage pits outside the
tunnel exit, and a trash dump beyond.
The architecture of the Antelope Creek ruins is highly variable (Lintz 1984).
The structures range from separate to contiguous, small to large, square to round,
deep to shallow, and with or without some or all of the aforementioned features, plus
others, depending apparently on resources and functions, experiments and idiosyncrasies, and spatiotemporal style changes. Perhaps much of the architectural
variability reflects a coalescence of diverse building ideas--not only from Mogollon
and Anasazi influences, but also from Apishapa and Upper Republican refugees-added to local traditions.
Middens consist largely of ashes, boiling pebble fragments, animal bones,
waste flakes, pot sherds, and discarded tools, except that in the industrial villages
around the quarries they consist chiefly of debris from reduction of big, thick,
bifacial quarry blanks. The faunal remains are mostly splinters of crushed and boiled
bison bones, but many kinds of smaller game are represented. Charred remains of
corn, beans, squash, and other plants have been recovered.
Many burials have been found under floors, in cache pits, and in sizeable graves
partially filled with rocks. The skeletons are usually flexed and are seldom
accompanied by more than a few personal possessions, except that the bison tibia
dibble blades that were used to dig the graves were consistently left among the rocks
in the grave fill (so these implements of death would not be used in gardening?).
Some comparative typological studies have been made on the skulls, which are
distinctively round and high.
The technology in stone, bone, shell, and pottery is rich and varied, practical,
resourceful, and skillful. It gives the impression of thorough and effective exploitation of every material available. The chipped stone tools often exhibit the
consummate craftsmanship of full-time professional flintknappers. The large, thin,
sharp, oval knives are on a par with the best flint work anywhere in the world. An
array of specialized knapping tools of stone, bone, and antler awaits expert study.
Small elbow pipes were laboriously carved from a hard pinkish siltstone, at least
some of which evidently came from nodules in the Triassic redbeds around
Landergin Mesa. Paired shaft-smoothers and grooved awl-sharpeners of sandstone
are among the several kinds of grinding tools. Bison tibia hoes, scapula trowels, rib
rasps, and various kinds of awls and punches are common among the bone tools.
Mussel shells were used for several kinds of tools and ornaments. Many kinds of
beads and pendants were made from stone, bone, and shell; Olivella shell beads
were favorites.
The Borger Cordmarked cooking pots were thoroughly functional: large,
undecorated, ollalike vessels, wide mouthed for easy filling and emptying, highnecked for control of boiling, globular-bodied for maximum volume with minimum
dimensions, round bottomed for stability on small firepits and soft ground, part
tempered with angular fragments of crushed quartzose boiling pebbles for strong
bonding with clay, thin walls compacted with a nonsticking cord-wrapped paddle
for more strength and less weight, and cord-roughened exteriors to increase the

Hughes ~ Prehistoric Cultural Developments

33

surface area for faster heating with less fuel. Exotic items of many kinds indicate a
strong trade network, especially with the Anasazi Pueblos to the west; obsidian,
turquoise, painted pottery, and Olivella shell beads are some of the more common
intrusives. Without much doubt, Alibates agate was the principal export.
The terminal culture of the Antelope Creek focus is basically so similar to that
of many of other late prehistoric villagers in the Southern and Central Great Plains,
who appear to have evolved into the historic Caddoan-speaking Kichai, Wichita,
Pawnee, and Arikara tribes in different parts of the plains that the linguistic and
ethnic affiliations of the group seem most likely to have been Caddoan (Hughes
1968). Future studies of the economic, social, and religious patterns implicit in the
Antelope Creek evidence may therefore benefit greatly from the careful use of
analogy with the ethnography of the historic Plains Caddoans.
The Antelope Creek focus in the Texas Panhandle may have been rooted in the
Lake Creek complex, just as Village cultures elsewhere in the Plains seem to have
evolved out of local Woodland cultures. In the Panhandle, however, the development may have received some special stimuli, at first from Mogollon, and later from
Anasazi sources. Whether or not the Palo Duro complex was also involved in this
development remains to be explored. Horticultural improvements, fortuitously
coupled with an abundance of bison, seem to have promoted a rapid population
increase, which may have been augmented by increases of related Apishapa and
Upper Republican groups escaping from the drought at about A. D. 1300 in eastern
Colorado and western Nebraska and Kansas, as some writers have suggested
(Campbell 1976, Baerreis and Bryson 1965).
There is considerable circumstantial evidence to suggest that an Antelope
Creek focus thus strengthened may have constituted a final holdout of the Caddoan
villagers on the High Plains until about the middle of the fifteenth century, when
increasingly hostile relationships with less sedentary trading together with raiding
Apache immigrants forced a withdrawal to the northeast to join other Plains
Caddoan relatives in fortified villages on the Arkansas and Platte (Hughes 1968).
The Ochoa Phase
Although it is not nearly so well known, the Ochoa phase seems to represent
a development on the South Plains somewhat similar to but less spectacular than that
of the Antelope Creek focus in the Panhandle Plains. As indicated earlier, the Late
Neoindian Ochoa phase is thought to have evolved out of the Early Neoindian
Querecho phase via a brief transitional Maljamar phase as part of an Eastern Jornada
sequence on the South Plains.
The Ochoa phase has been identified at most of the sites where the earlier
phases are recognizable; it is generally much better represented than they are, and
is found at additional sites as well. The phase is marked mainly by a shift from
pithouses to jaeallike surface houses with stone and adobe foundations, increased
dependence on bison, side-notched arrowpoints rather than corner-notched arrowpoints, beveled knives, locally made Ochoa Indented Brown Ware replacing locally

34

Texas Archeological Society

made plain and corrugated brownwares, and increased quantities and varieties of
imported Mogollon and Anasazi painted wares.
Late Neoindian trade in the South Plains was not exclusively Puebloan. Sherds
of shell-tempered Nocona Plain from the Henrietta focus of North Cenlral Texas,
of clay-tempered Bullard Brushed from the Frankston focus of East Texas (or Little
Deer Brushed from the Wheeler complex of western Oklahoma), and bonetempered Leon Plain and Doss Red Ware from the Toyah focus of Central Texas
have been found at several sites, especially along the eastern fringes of the Llano
Estacado, but also far to the west in the valleys on the uplands. The Puebloan trade
potter/indicates a span of A.D. 1300 to 1450 for the Ochoa phase. If these dates are
reliable, the Ochoa phase may have been a holdout in the South Plains as the
Antelope Creek focus was in the Panhandle Plains. The terminal dates that have
been proposed for all of the local ceramic sequences from southeastern New Mexico
northward into southeastern Colorado form a remarkably consistent pattern: A.D.
1350 for the Late Ceramic phase in the Guadalupe Mountains (Phelps 1974), A.D.
1300 for the McKenzie phase in the middle Pecos valley (Jelinek 1967), A.D. 1300
for the Pueblo Period in Los Esteros Reservoir (Mobley 1978), A.D. 1300 for the
Cimarron phase in the Cimarron district (Kirkpatrick 1976), and A.D. 1300 for the
Apishapa focus on the Chaquaqua Plateau (Campbell 1976).
In most of these localities, there are some later materials that have been
tentatively identified as representing one Apache group or another. Were the
Antelope Creek and Ochoa people like islands in an encroaching sea of alternately
trading and raiding Apaches, who were spreading rapidly southward down the
foothills and plains at about A.D. 1300 and forcing small isolated frontier Tanoan
groups westward to their mountain pueblos and similar Caddoan groups eastward
to their prairie villages or southward into the Canadian breaks? Was some of the
Puebloan exchange manifested in the Antelope Creek and Ochoa cultures mediated
by Apaches? Did the Great Drought of A.D. 1276 to 1299 in the Southwest have
the same effect on the tiny Puebloan settlements of the eastern frontier along the
Rocky Mountain foothills that it had on the mighty cliff-dwellings and pueblos in
the Four Corners country?
One of the most fascinating problems remaining in the prehistory of the
Western Great Plains is how the Tanoan-speaking Kiowa became bison-hunting
Plains nomads closely allied with the Athapascan-speaking Kiowa Apache. Jelinek
(1967) has suggested the possibility of Kiowa-Kiowa Apache roots in the McKenzie phase of A.D. 1200 to 1300 on the middle Pecos. The Ochoa phase of A.D. 1300
to 1450 on the South Plains would seem to be another likely possibility, perhaps
even more likely.
Apache Complexes
Evidence that has been coming to light with increasing frequency in recent
years seems to indicate that Apache occupation on the Texas High Plains may be
represented by materials that are separable into two distinguishable complexes: a
Tierra Blanca complex in the Panhandle Plains and a Garza complex in the South

Hughes ~ Prehistoric Cultural Developments

35

Plains. Although the two complexes are identifiable at a great many sites scattered
over their respective regions, much more work must be done before either can be
characterized in any detail.
The type sites for the Tierra Blanca complex are the Tierra Blanca ruin on the
creek of that name in Deaf Smith County (Holden 1931; Spielmann 1982, 1983),
and the Fifth Green site on Palo Duro Creek in Randall County (Kalokowski n.d.).
The complex seems to be manifested at two kinds of sites: some, like the Tierra
Blanca ruin, are large villages marked mainly by stone foundations of jacallike
structures, triangular side-and-base-notched Harrell, side-notched Washita, and
unnotched Fresno and Talco-like arrowpoints, and much Anasazi trade material,
including many sherds of glaze-polychrome and plain utility ware. Others, like the
Fifth Green site, are small camps marked mainly by the same kind of utility ware
accompanying the same kinds of arrowpoints.
The utility ware resembles Apachean Perdido Plain (Gunnerson 1971) and
Puebloan Pecos faint-striated; it has recently been defined as Tierra Blanca Plain
(Habicht-Manche 1987). The vessels were small, squat, olla-shaped cooking pots
of the kind that might be worth taking along on hunting trips. The sherds are thin and
dark, smooth and hard, with temper of fine sand, usually micaceous.
The Tierra Blanca complex seems to represent a semisedentary and seminomadic, bison-hunting and possibly corn-growing people who were much involved
in trade with the Anasazi pueblos, with sites like Tierra Blanca their base villages
and sites like Fifth Green their hunting camps. Several of the base villages have been
recorded, mainly along Tierra Blanca Creek and Palo Duro Canyon, but only a few
have been tested, and only two of the excavations have been reported. Many of the
hunting camps have been recorded in various parts of the Panhandle Plains, and
more than a dozen of these sites have been described in survey reports; a few have
been tested and reported.
Some of the base villages of the Tierra Blanca complex, including the type site,
are in exposed locations on valley or canyon rims. Others are on broad terraces in
sheltered parts of the canyons. Exposed sites like the Tierra Blanca ruin may have
been summer villages, whereas the more protected sites may have been winter
villages. The Tierra Blanca village overlooks a broad floodplain in a well-watered
part of the creek valley; charred corn was found in the excavations.
The glazewares from some of the base villages have been identified as mainly
glazes C and D, dating at about A.D. 1450 and 1500. Radiocarbon dates have been
determined for two probable components of the Tierra Blanca complex: A.D. 1550
and 1650 for the top Level 1 at the Canyon City Club Cave (Hughes 1969), and A.D.
1590 for the South Mouth site in the lower part of Tule Canyon (Katz and Katz
1976). The descriptions of the bison-hunting Querechos encountered on the
Panhandle-Plains by the Coronado expedition in 1541 and of the corn-growing
Faraones discovered by the Onate expedition in 1601 probably constitute eyewitness accounts of the lifestyle of the Tierra Blanca complex in both of its two main
aspects.

36

Texas Archeological Society

The type site for the Garza complex is the site of that name in Garza County
~unkles 1964). A review of much of the data available for the Gavza complex has
been published (Johnson et al. 1977). The complex seems to be marked by Harrell,
Washita, Fresno, and Talco-like arrowpoints and by glaze-polychrome and plain
utility ware like that of the Tierra Blanca complex, but to have two additional distinctive arrowpoint types, the base-notched triangular Garza and Lott points, which
are rare to absent in the Panhandle Plains, and to lack evidence of fixed dwellings,
at least at any of the known components ~unkles 1964; Word 1991, this volume).
At the Bridwell site, which is enclosed by a large, low, circular mound, glazepolychrome sherds dating as early as the 1300s were found (Parker 1982). Was the
mound formed by blowsand trapped in a brush pile surrounding a winter tipi camp?
Survey reports indicate that scores of Garza components have been encountered all over the South Plains; at least a dozen components have been described in
excavation reports. Some of the components, including the type site, have produced
no pottery; some, like the Lubbock Lake site (Johnson et al. 1977), have produced
only utility ware; a few, like the Montgomery site (Word 1965; Northern 1979),
have produced both utility ware and large quantities of gl~e-polychrome sherds.
This suggests that the Garza complex has the same kind of hunting camp/base
village contrast as the Tierra Blanca complex.
Glaze-polychrome pottery at some of the Garza components suggests approximate contemporaneity with the Tierra Blanca complex. The gl~eware of the
Montgomery site is mainly E and F, dating from A.D. 1550 to 1700. Two
radiocarbon dates of A.D. 1635 and 1665 for the Garza components (three camping
areas and one processing station) at the Lubbock Lake site may be as much as 50
years too young (Johnson et al. 1977:105).
The Tierra Blanca complex in the Panhandle Plains and the Garza complex in
the South Plains appear to represent two main groups of late prehistoric to early
historic Apaches on the Texas High Plains, traceable perhaps to the Lipans and
Mescaleros of later historic time. It should be noted, however, that Baugh (1986),
in redefining the protohistoric Wheeler complex of western Oklahoma, suggests
that the Garza complex may be a westward extension of the Wheeler complex, since
Wheeler components sometimes have Garza arrowpoints, and Garza components
sometimes have pottery identified as Edwards Plain and Little Deer Plain and
Decorated, characteristic of the Wheeler complex. If the Garza complex is not
Apache, there is the intriguing possibility that it as well as the Wheeler complex
represents the Teyas, probable Caddoan-spcakers found by Coronado in the
barrancas to the southeast of their Querecho enemies. The Teyas directed Coronado
to the Quiviran Wichitas in Kansas, who were painted like the Teyas and otherwise
resembled them.
SUMMARY
An effort has been made here to assess the present state of our knowledge of
prehistoric cultural developments on the Texas High Plains during Paleoindian,

Hughes m Prehistoric Cultural Developments

37

Archaic, and Neoindian times and to explore the possible effects on those
developments of changes in the regional environment and in the surrounding
cultures.
This synthesis is based on archeological investigations spanning all but the first
and last few years of the twentieth century. Archeological research started earlier
in the Texas High Plains than is some other parts of the state but has been pursued
less intensively. As elsewhere in Texas, however, the research has been accelerating
since midcentury, and enough progress has now been made with descriptive
archeology (who, what, where, and when) to permit some beginnings on explanatory archeology (the how and why).
The Texas High Plains are part of a huge piedmont-plateau comprising the
northwestern one-sixth of the state, looming over the Rolling Plains to the east and
the Edwards Plateau to the southeast, seemingly level on top but actually sloping
toward the east in the Panhandle and to the southeast in the South Plains (see Figure
1). This vast plateau, with its high rugged edges and flat uplands (the landscape, like
the weather, is mostly mild but sometimes harsh) may seem like a barrier between
the prairies and forests to the east and the mountains and basins to the west, but in
reality it appears to have been more of a bridge than a barrier to prehistoric foottravelers, since ample evidence indicates that it was traversed both eastward and
westward by most of the native cultures from Paleoindian through Historic times.
The Texas High Plains are breached by the Canadian breaks across the
Panhandle, and southward the uplands are interrupted by the shallow eastward- and
southeastward-draining valleys of the headwater tributaries of the Red, Brazos, and
Colorado rivers. These watercourses must have been like highways for east-west
travelers and like rest stops for north-south trekkers. The intervening plains are
dotted with thousands of playa lake basins that should have facilitated travel in all
directions except during severe droughts.
There is a variety of vegetation along the watercourses, but over the thousands
of square miles of level uplands between the valleys there was nothing but short
grasses, and bison were about the only resource--but what a resource[
The valleys and canyons on and around the Texas High Plains have several
kinds of megascopically distinguishable lithic resources that provide unusually
favorable opportunities for lithic analyses and paleocultural interpretations.
Just as short-range weather changes strongly affect life on the Texas High
Plains in modern times, so did long-range climatic cycles affect life during
prehistoric times, especially since the uplands were little more than a great buffalo
pasture-essentially a single-resource region. Increasingly numerous and varied
kinds of paleoenvironmental studies seem to be approaching a consensus on the
general trends of prehistoric climatic changes, but not yet on specific events and
times (see Table 1). From about 11,000 years ago (circa. 9,500 B.C.) until around
6,000 B.C., there was an Anathermal climate, which was much cooler and wetter
than the present. This climate moderated slowly, very gradually becoming less cool
and wet.

A.D. ll00-1500.-Medithermal climate continues. Turning warmer and drier;
bison abundant. Late Ceramic substage; village-based bison hunting, developed
horticulture (corn, beans, squash); Plains village (Caddoan) cultures like Anasaziinfluenced Antelope Creek in the Texas Panhandle, with Borger Cordmarked
pottery; Washita River in western Oklahoma, with Lindsay Plain; and Henrietta in
North Central Texas, with Nacona Plain pottery; globular-bodied, wide-mouthed
cooking pots; Ochoa culture (late surface-house phase of Eastern Jornada) on the
southern Llano Estacado, with Ochoa Indented; all villagers with perfected bisonhunting Washita arrowpoints (side-notched triangular) and bison-butchering Harahey knives (diamond-shaped beveled); various bison-bone tools, large bison-bone
middens.

Prehistoric to Historic stage; foot-nomad to horse-nomad bison hunting; Apache
cultures like Tierra Blanca in Panhandle and possibly Garza in South Plains;

arrows; Hispanics from New Mexico visiting the region seasonally as ciboleros
(mounted bison hunters with large iron lance points), comancberos (Comanche
traders), and pastores (sheepherders).
1870s.-Southern Plains bison being exterminated by Anglo hunters with modern
rifles; 1874-The Red River Wars, Comanche placed on Oklahoma reservations;
1876-Cattle ranching begins.

Much evidence supports the concept of an Altithermal Long Drought from
about 5000 to 2000 B.C., when bison (and people) were scarce (because of too little
short grass?), and of a mesic interval during most of the first millennium A.D., when
bison (but not people) were scarce (this time because of too much tall grass?).
The various cultural sequences that have been proposed for the Texas High
Plains and surrounding regions generally are based on essentially the same four
main temporal units (Early, Middle, and Late Prehistoric, and Historic), but these
units are still somewhat variably named, defined, and dated. Significantly, the least
variability occurs in treatments of the Paleoindian stage, no doubt reflecting the
free-roaming, far-ranging nature of the late Pleistocene big-game-hunting cultures.
In sharp contrast to the abundant evidence of Paleoindian presence on the
Southern High Plains, including the Texas part, the evidence for Early and Middle
Archaic presence during the Altithermal is scarce, and the much more abundant
evidence of Late Archaic hunters-gatherers has not yet received the attention it

40

Texas Archeological Society

deserves. In the bordering regions to east and west, the Archaic sequence seems to
be more complete but is still poorly known; to the south and southeast in TransPecos and Central Texas, the entire Archaic stage is well represented and much
investigated, especially in Central Texas, where there is good evidence for transitional Paleoindian/Archaic cultures.
The Neoindian sequence in the Panhandle Plains generally resembles the
sequences in the neighboring regions to the north, east, and west; Plains Woodland
complexes followed by Plains Villages components, all of the sequences being
marked by a shift from Late Archaic barbed dart points for bison hunting to
Woodland barbed arrowpoints for deer hunting at circa A.D. 1 to 200, and another
shift to Village triangular arrowpoints for renewed bison hunting at about A.D. 1000
to 1100. It seems likely that all of these changes involved groups ancestral to historic
Plains Caddoan-speaking tribes. A far west exception to this general picture is the
Anasazi Basketmaker-Pueblo sequence in the Canadian River headwaters region in
the Sierra Madre foothills.
On the South Plains and surrounding regions, the Neoindian sequences are
more varied. To the west of the South Plains and up onto the southwestern part of
the plains are early (pithouse) to late (surface house) Jornada Mogollon complexes,
with the sequences marked by shifts in projectile point styles comparable to those
to the north, but generally somewhat later. The Mogollon-influenced Palo Duro
complex, stretching from the Canadian breaks southward along the eastern Caprock
escarpment of the Llano Estacado, was coeval with Woodland and early Mogollon
complexes. In Central Texas, to the southeast of the South Plains, the "Late
Prehistoric" sequence begins with a shift from barbed dart points to barbed
arrowpoints, as elsewhere, but possibly later. At about A.D. 1300, new styles of
barbed arrowpoints and some triangular arrowpoints appear. In the Rolling Plains
to the east and in the Trans-Pecos region to the south, the shift is to triangular
arrowpoints about this time.
Available evidence (in the form of dated remains, early dart point types, and
Clear Fork gouges) for an Early to Middle Archaic presence on the Southern High
Plains in Texas and elsewhere indicates that the upland valleys and basins were
seldom visited during the Altithermal Long Drought, and that if the sheltered,
spring-fed breaks along the eastern and northern edges of the Llano Estacado were
more frequently occupied than the uplands, Altithermal arroyo-scouting may have
removed most of the remains.
With the end of the Long Drought at about 2000 B.C., it seems that grass and
bison began returning to the uplands of the Southern High Plains, followed by
groups who had been developing a foraging lifestyle involving several new
technologies, in the comparatively resource-rich environments of the neighboring
broken lands since the end of Paleoindian big game hunting. Coming mainly,
perhaps, from the Rolling Plains to the east and the Edwards Plateau to the southeast,
these groups apparently started a revival of Paleoindian bison hunting techniques
which, added to their Early Archaic foraging strategies, enabled them to develop a
new, highly efficient hunting-gathering lifeway that led to a Late Archaic population

Hughes ~ Prehistoric Cultural Developments

41

increase and endured for at least two millennia. The Little Sunday complex in the
Palo Duro Canyon area may be representative of this Late Archaic substage on the
Texas High Plains.
In the breaks of the eastern and southeastern Panhandle are numerous arroyotrap bison kills with barbed dart points, like the Twilla site near Turkey, Texas. Since
some of these kills have been radiocarbon-dated to between 90 B.C. and A.D. 970,
it has been suggested that they may be Woodland rather than Late Archaic in age
(Lintz et al. 1991, this volume). The dates may be too late, however, since they are
on bone, which is notoriously unreliable (cf. Cox and Smith 1991, this volume).
Bison bone is abundant at most Late Archaic camps, but it is scarce at most
Woodland campsites in the region.
The masses of bison bones in most of these kills are deeply buffed at the heads
of old arroyos, where they are exposed in the cutbanks of modern arroyos that have
eroded headward and somewhat beyond along the courses of the earlier healed-over
arroyos. These circumstances indicate that the kills took place near the end of the
last episode of arroyo-cutting (xeric interval) before the present climate and just
before an episode of arroyo-filling (mesic interval). Bison must have been extremely abundant and killing extremely effective during this xeric interval, since
butchering is minimal at most of the sites. The mesic interval seems likely to be the
one that spanned most of the first millennium A.D. More reliable dating of these
very significant kills is sorely needed.
It appears that with the onset of cooler and moister conditions on the Southern
High Plains near the beginning of the Christian era, the many bison herds on which
Late Archaic foragers depended for much of their subsistence began to disappear
from the region, and a new lifestyle, which can be labeled Early Neoindian, began
to evolve. This transition is marked not only by increasing numbers of deer remains
over bison remains in the campsites, but also by increasing numbers of barbed
arrowpoints over barbed dart points, implying changes not only in the principal
game being hunted but also in the main weapons and techniques being employed.
Coevally, the appearance of pottery throughout the region--of the Woodland
tradition in the north and the Mogollon tradition in the south--suggests a shift to a
less nomadic existence. This inference is more directly supported by evidence of
houses at some of the Woodland components and especially at some of the
Mogollon components. Although it seems likely that some horticultural experimentation was beginning at this time, little or no direct evidence of incipient gardening
has yet been reported.
In the Panhandle Plains area, Late Archaic complexes such as Little Sunday
were being replaced by Woodland complexes such as Lake Creek and by Mogolloninfluenced complexes such as Palo Duro. In the South Plains, Late Archaic
complexes such as Hueco were being replaced by Mogollon complexes such as
Querecho/Maljamar. The frequent present of Mogollon brownware at Woodland
sites in the Texas Panhandle suggests that the region may have played a significant
role in an exchange of horticultural, housing, and other important ideas between the

Woodland tradition to the north and east and the Mogollon tradition to the south and
west during Early Neoindian times.
Toward the end of the first millennium A.D., it appears that the mesic interlude
on the Southern High Plains was giving way to a wanning and drying trend that
continues to this day. Bison herds evidently began returning to the region in
increasing numbers, perhaps attracted by a renewed dominance of nutritious short
grasses on the uplands. The herds may have been spreading southward from the
Northwestern Great Plains, where--in contrast to the Southern High Plains--they
were abundant throughout the first millennium A.D. This is indicated by many bison
kills attributed to the Avonlea complex, which is marked by the earliest known
appearance of Washita-like arrowpoints and Harahey-like knives. The Avonlea
complex may represent former Arctic caribou-hunting Athapascans who were
migrating southward during the early Christian era into Montana and Wyoming,
where they perfected this specialized tool kit for killing and butchering bison.
As the first millennium A.D. was ending on the Southern High Plains, a new
millennium was beginning both literally and figuratively. It seems likely that the
southward-migrating bison herds were accompanied by the southward-diffusing
tool kit, and that the bison herds were so abundant and the tool kit was so effective
that by A.D. 1000 the Early Neoindian Plains Woodland deer-hunting campers were
rapidly being transformed into Late Neoindian sedentary bison-hunters, represented by complexes such as Upper Republican, Apishapa, Optima, and--in the
Texas Panhandle---Buffed City and Antelope Creek. Sedentary hunting is a rare
phenomenon, perhaps best exemplified elsewhere in this country by the marinemammal-hunting villages of the Northwest Coast.
Bison must have been so numerous that individual animals could be taken as
needed from herds surrounding the villages. Kill sites are rare, and household
middens are full of bison bones representing all parts of the animals, which suggests
that they were often procured at no great distance from home.
On the Texas South Plains, a comparable transition was taking place in the
Eastern Jornado Mogollon sequence at a somewhat later date, around A.D. 1200,
producing the Late Neoindian Ochoa complex. Meanwhile, along the eastern
Caprock escarpment of the Llano Estacado, the deer-hunting Palo Duro complex,
with Scallorn and Deadman arrowpoints, may have been drifting southward to
become the bison-hunting Toyah complex of Central and West Texas, with Perdiz
and Toyah arrowpoints. At some Palo Duro components along the southern part of
the scarp, Deadman points seem to be changing into Perdiz points.
In the Rolling Plains to the east, similar Plains Village developments were
producing the Washita phase in western Oklahoma and the Henrietta focus in North
Central Texas. To the west, Jornada Mogollon surface-house village complexes
were developing along the Pecos River valley in eastern New Mexico and spreading
northward into the upper Canadian River drainage in northeastern New Mexico,
whereas frontier Anasazi Pueblo settlements were being established in both
drainages along the Rocky Mountain foothills.

Hughes ~ Prehistoric Cultural Developments

During the next two or three centuries, on the Southern High Plains and in the
prairies to the northeast and east, there was a florescence of the bison-based Plains
Village tradition, as populations increased and countless homesteads, hamlets, and
villages appeared. A far-flung trade network developed among the villagers and
with the Pueblos to the west, contributing to significant horticultural, architectural,
and other innovations in material, social, and ideological culture.
By the A.D. 1300s, however, the Apishapa and Upper Republican villages to
the north and northeast were disappearing, as were the Anasazi and Mogollon
pueblos to the west, while the first traces of Apachean bison-hunting nomads were
appearing in those regions and on the Texas High Plains as well. Although the Great
Drought of A.D. 1276 to 1299 in the Southwest may have been partly responsible
for these abandonments, a great southward movement of the sometimes trading,
sometimes raiding Southern Athapascans down the mountain-plains borderlands
seems likely to have been the main factor.
The foothill Puebloans probably withdrew westward, seeking refuge among
the large pueblos in the mountains; some of the Apishapa and Upper Republican
villagers may have retreated southward, forming a coalescence with their Antelope
Creel< kindred in a kind of great refugium along the Canadian breaks in the
Panhandle Plains (Campbell 1976). As of now, this postulated coalescence is based
mainly on circumstantial evidence such as a shift in Antelope Creek architectural
styles at about A.D. 1300 (Lintz 1978b, 1984). The hypothesis needs to be tested by
searching for more direct evidence in the form of possible immigrant communities
in the Antelope Creek area; for example, further study is needed of a few sites with
peculiar architecture and Upper Republican-like collared-rim pottery.
For the next century and a half, until about A.D. 1450, the Antelope Creek
villages in the Panhandle Plains and the Ochoa villages in the South Plains may have
endured like islands in a sea of Apaches, represented by the Tierra Blanca complex
to the north and, perhaps the Garza complex to the south. During this period the
Apaches appear to have become semisedentary and increasingly involved in trade
with the mountain Pueblos, perhaps to some extent as intermediaries in trade
between the Pueblos and the plains villages.
On the Texas High Plains of late prehistoric times, however, the pattern of
Apache-Pueblo interaction of the 1600s in New Mexico may have already been
anticipated--good-times trading interrupted occasionally by hard-times raiding.
As Alex Krieger suggested long ago (1946), severe droughts at around A.D. 1450
may have left the Antelope Creek villagers without any surplus crops for trading,
bringing on Apache raids that made their already precarious position intolerable and
forcing them to abandon their ancestral homeland in favor of the comparative safety
afforded by kindred Caddoan-speaking villages in the prairies to the northeast
(Hughes 1968).
Did some of the Ochoa villages holding out on the South Plains find a different
solution to the Apache problem? Did they trade their village life for a nomadic
existence with the Apaches? Does this help explain the enigmatic Kiowa-Kiowa
Apache alliance (of Tanoan- and Athapascan-speaking groups) during historic
times on the western plains? If you can’t lick ’em, join ’em!
