ABSTRACT

In 1999 and 2001, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Archeology Survey Team conducted an
intensive survey of the ca. 500 acres of level terrain around the rock hills in Hueco Tanks State Park and
Historic Site, located in northeastern El Paso County. The entire park is designated as site 41EP2; this
property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and was officially designated as
a State Archeological Landmark in 1983. Twenty-nine archeological localities were defined within this
area during the current investigations, containing cultural components that can be isolated horizontally
and vertically.
The porphyritic syenite hills of Hueco Tanks have attracted humans for some 10,000 years, providing shelter, capturing and holding water, serving as a canvas for rock imagery, providing a grinding surface, and yielding rocks for heating and cooking. Water was the main resource that spurred use of Hueco
Tanks. Beginning in prehistoric times it was retained behind simple dams, allowing greater numbers of
people to gather. Archaic groups hunted the abundant and diverse animal population, and processed
wild plants in bedrock mortars while occupying nearby rockshelters. The most intensive occupations
at Hueco Tanks took place during the DoÃ±a Ana phase; groups living in multiple areas cultivated corn
and beans in small patches of moist soils, and roasted leaf succulents in rock-lined pits. Almost all of
the items used by prehistoric groups at Hueco Tanks were collected in or near the Hueco Bolson, but
pottery was obtained through a trade network that involved groups to the northwest and north, and
to a limited extent, Mexico. Hueco Tanks also was a focal point in the spiritual landscape of the eastern
Hueco Bolson for 1,000 years or more. The abundant rock imagery primarily appears to represent ritual
petitions for rain; some pictographs date to the Middle to Late Archaic, but most probably were painted
during the DoÃ±a Ana phase, when Hueco Tanks supported the greatest number of people. Sacred precincts were established high on the hills, and many persons were laid to rest at the Tanks. Native groups
traveled a trail through Hueco Tanks toward water and salt sources on the east for centuries, and their
descendants guided military scouts and travelers along it, beginning in 1692. Although a stage station
was established briefly in 1858, the first permanent historic occupation was the Escontrias ranch, which
operated from 1898 to 1956. Military training was conducted at the Tanks in the 1940s and 1950s.
Recreational activities began before the turn of the century and continually increased, culminating in
establishment of the state park in 1970.
A plan is provided for management and protection of the significant cultural resources in Hueco
Tanks State Park and Historic Site. Recommendations are made for future investigations and interpretation at the park. The artifacts and records from these investigations are curated by the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department in Austin.

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

by Margaret Howard

In 1999 and 2001, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) Archeology Survey Team
conducted an intensive archeological survey of the ca. 500 acres of level terrain around the rock hills in
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site (Figure 2). Located in extreme northeastern El Paso County,
the park is at the end of Ranch Road 2775, 5.5 miles (8.9 km) north of its intersection with U.S. Highway
62/180, and approximately 32 miles northeast of the city of El Paso. The property was obtained from El
Paso County by special deed on June 12, 1969, and expanded by purchase of 121 acres from a private
landowner on August 10, 1970. The park covers 860 acres, and was opened to the public in May 1970.
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July
14, 1971, and was officially designated as a State Archeological Landmark on June 28, 1983.
The mission of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site is to protect, restore, and interpret the
unique natural and cultural features of the park. The goal of interpretation at the park is to foster an
appreciation of the irreplaceable quality of the site and an understanding of the diverse meanings it
holds for individuals and cultures, and to inspire advocacy for and stewardship of Hueco Tanks and
other national treasures (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 2004:8).
These investigations were conducted as part of a multi-pronged effort made in the late 1990s to
improve stewardship of cultural and natural resources in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site,
which included development of a Resource Management Plan (Bryan et al. 1999) and establishment of
a Public Use Plan (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 2000). Two cultural resource inventory studies also were undertaken. In the spring of 1999, Rupestrian CyberServices, Inc. of Flagstaff, Arizona
mapped and photographed known and newly discovered imagery sites on the rock hills, and created a
geographic information system database for them (Rupestrian CyberServices 2000). The TPWD Archeology Survey Team made an inventory of archeological localities on the ca. 500 acres of level terrain
around the rock hills through intensive pedestrian survey during three field sessions: April 6 to May 11,
1999, July 13-20, 1999, and August 7-10, 2001. The preliminary findings of these surveys were used to
guide trail planning and delineate visitor access zones. The information on the distribution and significance of cultural resources that is provided in this report also will support long-term protection of the
cultural resources in the state park.
This report begins with this Introduction and Management Summary, which summarizes the
history of human occupation at Hueco Tanks in language suitable for public interpretation, identifies
areas where significant and sensitive cultural resources are located, and provides general guidelines for
protecting them. In the main body of the report, the Environmental Background describes the landscape
and resources of the park and vicinity. The Prehistoric Background section relates the history of Indian
cultures in this part of Texas, examines significant archeological sites in the vicinity, and reviews previous
archeological work in the park. The Historical Background relates accounts of human activities in and
near Hueco Tanks written over the past 400 years. The next section describes the Methods of Archeological

Introduction and Management Summary

Investigations. The Features, Structures, and Distributions section explores the nature, age, and purpose
of the cultural features and artifacts found across the park. The Rock Imagery section reviews images
that have been recorded in sheltered areas on the rock hills, and considers their styles and likely ages. The
Materials Recovered section describes the prehistoric and historic items that were collected, and explains
how they were identified and dated. The Research Findings outline 10,000 years of human history at
Hueco Tanks, focusing on the activities that occurred, their patterning across the landscape, and their
significance in the region. The final section is the Management Plan for Cultural Resources, which
explains how the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department complies with state and federal laws and agency
policies for cultural resource protection, describes the activities that can damage these resources, and
provides priorities for taking care of significant areas of the park. The report ends with recommendations
for future archeological investigation and interpretation. Following a list of References Cited and several
Appendices of detailed findings, a Glossary gives the meanings of archeological terms used in the report.

10,000 YEARS OF OCCUPATION AT HUECO TANKS
The earliest objects made by humans that have been found at Hueco Tanks are fluted lance points
of the Folsom culture. Between 11,000 and 10,200 years ago (Table 1), these groups roamed across
wide areas and hunted a large type of bison (now extinct), along with smaller animals. Folsom hunters
spent the winter in the broad basins near the Rio Grande valley, and then apparently headed north to
hunt on the southern Great Plains during the summer and early fall. The weather was milder than it is
today, with cooler summers, warmer winters, and greater rainfall. Folsom camps were occupied briefly,
and typically were located in places offering an overview of the surrounding area and ready access to
water. At Hueco Tanks, Folsom hunters camped in the pass between North and East Mountains; bison
could have been driven through that canyon and hunted easily from the hills above. A few lance points
that date to the period between 10,200 and 8,000 years ago indicate that late Paleoindian hunters also
camped and hunted in the pass.
As the climate warmed between 9,000 and 8,000 years ago the large bison became extinct, and
people adopted a broader diet based on medium-sized and small animals, supplemented by plants.
Hunters began to use throwing sticks we call atlatls to launch dart points fastened onto spears. From
8,000 to 6,000/5,000 years ago during the Early Archaic period, Hueco Tanks was visited occasionally.
Visits to the Tanks increased between 6,000/5,000 and 3,200 years ago during the Middle Archaic period,
when activities were focused on the central area between the rock hills. By 4,000 years ago the modern
climate pattern was established. In Late Archaic times (3,200 to 1,800 years ago) populations were growing in the region, and groups camped for short periods in many areas of the Tanks. In the southwest
part of Hueco Tanks, small, temporary huts may have been built in a longer-term camp near small rock
hearths used for cooking and heating. Groups also are likely to have camped in rockshelters during the
Middle and/or Late Archaic periods. The Late Archaic diet included a wide range of plants like desert
shrubs, succulents, and leafy plants; mesquite beans and other seeds were crushed in deep mortar holes
in the rocks at Hueco Tanks. Images were first painted in sheltered areas of the Tanks during the Archaic
period, including realistic hunting scenes and abstract images.
Pottery came into use around 1,800 years ago, marking the beginning of the Formative period.
Populations continued to increase, causing changes in settlement, diet, and technology to occur more
rapidly. From 1,800 to 1,000 years ago during the Mesilla phase, settlement shifted from basin areas
toward slopes below mountain ranges, and people began to stay at places like Hueco Tanks for longer
periods. They hunted greater numbers of jackrabbits and cottontails, and adopted the bow and arrow

part of Hueco Tanks, where simple round huts may have stood near a few small rock hearths used for
cooking and heating.
Between 1,000 and 700 years ago during the DoÃ±a Ana phase, more people lived at Hueco Tanks
than during any period before or after, and similar places on slopes below mountains were occupied
across the region. People may have concentrated in these areas due to a 100-year period of warm and dry
weather, which was followed by relatively cool and wet weather for several centuries. In the northeast
part of the Tanks, a cluster of rectangular houses was built near two areas of moist soils that were used
as fields to grow corn and beans. In another area of the Tanks, agave, yucca, and/or sotol plants were
harvested with large chipped stone knives, and their root balls were rendered edible through slow roasting in rock-lined pits. Small rock dams were built to hold the water that flowed down cracks and chutes
on the rock hills during late summer rains, and a few larger pools held thousands of gallons of water
for longer periods of time. During dry periods, plants in the fields may have been kept alive by pouring
pots of water around their roots. Although jackrabbits and cottontails were hunted at the Tanks and in
the nearby basin, hunters sometimes ranged into the Hueco Mountains and to the Rio Grande in search
of game. These efforts were required to support the greater numbers of people who were relying on the
resources of Hueco Tanks during the DoÃ±a Ana phase.
The importance of water to groups at Hueco Tanks was recognized through the images on the walls
of rockshelters, most of which were likely painted during the DoÃ±a Ana phase, when Hueco Tanks supported the greatest number of people. Many images appear to represent prayers for a continuing supply
of this life-giving fluid. Spiritual leaders probably directed the type and placement of these images, and
also may have supervised burial of the deceased. Some images placed in hidden areas high on the rock
hills may have obtained sacred status. Hueco Tanks became a spiritual center, eclipsed only by large caves
3 miles to the west visited by people from the Tanks and other pilgrims from across the region.
Local pottery was used in increasing quantities during the DoÃ±a Ana phase, and was made nearby
but not at Hueco Tanks. Paint was first applied to the rims of plain brown jars between 1,200 and 1,000
years ago. Simple designs were initially applied in black or red paint (El Paso Bichrome), and soon, both
colors were used (El Paso Polychrome). Groups at Hueco Tanks also used pottery obtained through the
regional trade network, which had shifted from southwest New Mexico to south-central New Mexico.
Small-mouthed Chupadero Black-on-white jars were imported in large numbers and used to carry
water and other liquids, and Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta bowls also were obtained through trade.
The network brought small amounts of pottery from more distant areas, including a pendant shaped
from a beautiful piece of St. Johns Polychrome pottery from west-central New Mexico, and a few painted
Ramos Polychrome and Villa Ahumada Polychrome pots from northern Mexico.
By 700 years ago at the beginning of the El Paso phase, the small fields at Hueco Tanks were not
producing enough corn and beans to sustain the growing numbers of people who camped there.
Groups joined together and settled in areas near playas at the base of alluvial fans, where broad areas
of soil retaining subsurface moisture were available for fields. A pueblo 6 miles northwest of Hueco
Tanks may have had as many as 100 rooms; cottonwood beams used to build the roof of at least one
of them most likely were carried from the Tanks, the nearest source of that wood. Another resource
transported from Hueco Tanks to the pueblos was water, carried in pots and/or other containers
along a trail that led northwest from the Tanks toward several pueblos. Pueblo residents made brief
visits to the Tanks to hunt jackrabbit and cottontail, gather and possibly roast small amounts of
wild plants, get stone for grinding tools, and possibly to paint prayer petitions in the rockshelters.
Although the pueblos were involved in far-flung trade networks, almost none of those items were
brought to Hueco Tanks.

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

The period of abundant rainfall during the El Paso phase ended with several severe, short-term
droughts around 550 years ago. People abandoned the pueblos, Hueco Tanks, and most of the region,
although some groups may have remained, including the Manso and Suma who were encountered
along the Rio Grande about 400 years ago. Apache Indians slowly entered the region from the north,
and by 300 years ago were using Hueco Tanks and the surrounding area as their hunting ground. They
roasted agave, sotol, and/or yucca root balls in a large rock-lined pit at Hueco Tanks, and obtained water
from pools on the rock hills. They added images to the growing gallery in the rockshelters, as did Kiowa
and/or Comanche Indians who visited the Tanks from 200 to 150 years ago.
Spanish troops stopped at Hueco Tanks in 1692 before heading through a pass in the Hueco Mountains to obtain salt from sources further east. They were led by an Apache captive along a trail that
probably had been used for centuries before Europeans and Americans arrived in the region. Mescalero
Apache groups reportedly camped in or around the Tanks in 1777, having been pushed out of their
home ranges in and near the Organ, Sacramento, and Sierra Blanca Mountains by Comanche Indians
encroaching from the north. A conflict between Kiowa Indians and Mexican troops in 1839 apparently
took place at Hueco Tanks; present-day Kiowa elders and others believe that the 1839 battle scene is
depicted on a rock imagery panel at the Tanks.
Acquisition of the territory by the United States in the mid-nineteenth century brought an influx
of Anglo-American officials, adventurers, and settlers to El Paso. Among the first U.S. citizens to pass
through the Tanks around 1849 were gold seekers heading west to California along the trail. The trail
was briefly used by the Butterfield Overland Mail stage line from 1858 to 1859; after the stone and adobe
stage station was abandoned, travelers continued to shelter inside its walls for decades. Buffalo Soldiers
and other persons stopping at Hueco Tanks continued to inscribe their names on the rocks to commemorate their visits.
El Paso businessman Juan Armendariz purchased three sections centered on Hueco Tanks in 1895,
and began to use the area for ranching. In 1898, Silverio Escontrias bought most of the Hueco Tanks ranch
from Armendariz. By 1904 he had built an adobe ranch house, a three-room house, and a two-room
stable, the latter two buildings probably made of stones from the old stage station. The Escontrias family
operated the cattle and horse ranch until the mid 1950s, and built 15 dams out of rock, soil, and concrete
to capture the water that ran off the hills. The Tanks were opened to the public in the early twentieth
century, and became a popular recreation destination and picnic grounds frequented by persons from El
Paso and nearby Fort Bliss. Troops from the Fort used the area for antiaircraft training in the 1940s and
1950s, when a small landing strip was built on the north side of the Tanks for planes that towed targets.
Members of the fledgling El Paso Archaeological Society including Martin Crimmins were among
the first to actively and publicly support designation of Hueco Tanks as a public park in 1922. In 1935,
the National Park Service offered to purchase four sections around the Tanks, but Silverio Escontriasâ
widow Pilar was not interested in selling. After the Escontrias family sold the ranch in 1956, it passed
through a series of owners, some of whom developed it as a tourist attraction. Rental cabins, stables,
a cafÃ©, and a fake ghost town were constructed there at various times, and plans were floated for large
residential and resort developments.
Awareness of the significance of the rock imagery and archeology of Hueco Tanks and its increasing
risk of loss continued to grow in El Paso, however. Members of the El Paso archeological and historical
societies and faculty from The University of Texas at El Paso lobbied county officials, who purchased the
property in 1965. Under encouragement from state legislators, the county transferred the property to
the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in 1969, and Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site opened
in June 1970.

Introduction and Management Summary

Today, the Escontrias ranch house serves as the Interpretive Center for Hueco Tanks State Park
and Historic Site. Campers, hikers, rock climbers, and nature lovers visit the park for recreational and
educational purposes, while Mescalero Apache, Kiowa, Comanche, Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, and Pueblo of
Isleta Indians and other groups find spiritual connections at this desert oasis. The park staff continues to
protect the fragile archeological sites, rock imagery, and wildlife so they can be studied and appreciated
for years to come.

ARCHEOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF HUECO TANKS STATE PARK AND HISTORIC SITE
As state property, all construction and other ground-disturbing activities that could damage the
cultural resources of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site are governed by the Antiquities Code of
Texas, and regulated by the Texas Historical Commission. The Code states that âIt is the public policy
and in the public interest of the State of Texas to locate, protect, and preserve all sites . . . in, on, or under
any of the land . . . within the jurisdiction of the State of Texasâ (Section 191.002).
The entire area within the boundary of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site is officially designated as a State Archeological Landmark. Twenty-nine archeological localities were defined within this
area during the current investigations. These localities differ in terms of the significance and research
value of the archeological deposits they contain, and have been impacted by natural processes and prior
land uses to varying degrees. The susceptibility of each locality to future damage depends on the fragility of the cultural resources that it contains, as well as the level of visitation and natural processes in
that area. These factors have been used to identify zones of high and low archeological sensitivity within
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site (Figure 3). The zones of high archeological sensitivity encompass areas that contain significant cultural resources that are susceptible to damage, while the zones of
low archeological sensitivity include areas where cultural resources are absent or their research value is
judged to be relatively low.
The management plan developed from the archeological and historical information gathered during these investigations supports the TPWD mission âTo manage and conserve the natural and cultural resources of Texas. . . for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.â It provides a
framework for anticipating the actions that will be needed to protect the cultural resources of Hueco
Tanks State Park and Historic Site, and allows for planning to minimize the impacts of park operations
on those resources. For example, if facility development is contemplated, TPWD can use the zones of
archeological sensitivity to place construction projects in areas that will cause the least damage to significant archeological deposits. Substantial cost savings also can be realized on the archeological investigations that will be required when significant cultural resources will be destroyed. TPWD and the
Texas Historical Commission also will consider the zone map when they decide whether to require
archeological studies before a construction project is approved to go forward under the Antiquities
Code of Texas. If a construction project is located in a zone of high archeological sensitivity, it is likely
that archeological studies will be required and there will be additional costs and delays.
Guidance also can be obtained from the designated TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator for
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site when specific actions are contemplated or occurring that may
affect cultural resources at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site. Under TPWD policy and through
a Memorandum of Understanding with the Texas Historical Commission, the Cultural Resource Coordinator reviews all construction and maintenance projects that will damage the ground surface in the
park, and ensures that they comply with state and federal law, while maximizing the protection of
cultural resources. Almost every construction project must be approved in writing by the designated

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

by Margaret Howard and Logan McNatt

The igneous rock hills of Hueco Tanks are landmarks, rising up to 470 ft above the alluvial fan on
the west slope of the Hueco Mountains. Though they are near the arid desert floor, the hills capture and
hold water, which is retained in the igneous-derived soils around them. The soil moisture supports an
unusually abundant and diverse array of plants and animals, many of which are usually restricted to
higher elevations. The water sources, plants, animals, and sheltering rocks of Hueco Tanks have attracted
people throughout prehistoric and historic times. This section describes the physiography, geology, rock
and clay sources, soils, surface hydrology, climate and paleoenvironment, vegetation, and fauna in and
near the park. Alterations caused by historic land use also are reviewed.

PHYSIOGRAPHY
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site is located in the southeast part of the Basin and Range
physiographic province, in the Mexican Highland subdivision (Fenneman 1931:326-438). The province
is characterized by isolated, nearly parallel mountain ranges separated by broad flat basins (Church et
al. 1996:3). The park is located near the McGregor sub-basin at the northeast end of the Hueco Bolson, a broad basin that extends along the Rio Grande for about 130 miles from southeast to northwest
(Fenneman 1931:387-388; Gustavson 1991:3; Knowles 2008:2). A low divide at the north end of the
Hueco Bolson separates it from the Tularosa Basin (Fenneman 1931:385-387).
The northern Hueco Bolson is flanked on the east by the Hueco Mountains, which actually are the
dissected west edge of the Diablo Plateau (Ferguson 1986; Sellards et al. 1932:53). The crest of the main
range rises around 1,000 ft above the terrain to the west, and one prominent peakâCerro Alto (high hill
in Spanish)âtowers over 1,200 feet above the rest. The main escarpment of the Hueco Mountains lies
about 1 mile east of Hueco Tanks, and outlying foothills are located 2 to 3 miles to the northwest, west,
and southwest of the park (Figure 4). The west margin of the northern Hueco Bolson is defined by the
Franklin Mountains, located around 24 miles west of Hueco Tanks.
Hueco Tanks is situated on the sloping surface of accumulated sediments that have eroded from
the west flank of the Hueco Mountains. Four rock masses in the center of the park are the dominant
topographic features in the park, covering approximately 38 percent of the property. Forrest Kirkland
designated three of them as North Mountain, East Mountain, and West Mountain in 1939; East Spur
apparently was named at a later date. The highest hill is West Mountain, which rises up to 470 ft above
the surrounding terrain; the lowest is East Spur, which reaches a maximum height of 130 ft above the
level ground around it. The eastern slopes of these hills are relatively gentle, compared to steeper slopes
or bluffs on their west faces (Kirkland and Kirkland 1939:Plate 114). Elevations in the park range from
4,900 ft on top of West Mountain to ca. 4,470 ft on the west boundary.

Sheltered between the cluster of hills are broad basins on the south and west (see Figure 2). Deep
canyons cut into the northwest side of East Mountain (Mescalero Canyon) and the west side of North
Mountain (unnamed). The fractured rock hills also contain many cracks and overhangs, which offer
protection from the harsh desert environment for plants, animals, and humans. Numerous natural hollows (huecos in Spanish) in the rock are the source of the name for this landmark.

Environmental Background

GEOLOGY
The Hueco Mountains and outlying foothills consist primarily of sedimentary rocks, including
limestone, shale, marl, sandstone, and siltstone. The oldest formation in the vicinity of Hueco Tanks
(Figure 5) is the Fusselman Formation, a dolomitic cherty limestone that was laid down around over
400 million years ago during the Silurian period. Mississippian formations overlying it are Helms sandy
limestone and shale, and Rancheria limestone containing chert. These rocks are overlain by Pennsylvanian-age cherty limestones of the Magdalena Group. The Hueco Mountains are capped by limestones of
the Hueco Group that were deposited during the Permian period, including the fossiliferous and cherty
Hueco Canyon Formation (Collins and Raney 2000:10, 19-20; Wise 1977:8-12).
On the west margin of the Hueco Bolson, the oldest rocks in the Franklin Mountains date back to
around 1.2 billion years ago in the Precambrian era. This range is more diverse than the Hueco Mountains; igneous and metamorphic rocks include granite, basalt, rhyolite, and quartzite, while the sedimentary rocks are predominantly limestone, sandstone, shale, and conglomerate (Collins and Raney
2000:15-18).
During the early Tertiary period, igneous masses intruded into the overlying rocks of both of these
ranges, and eventually were exposed as the softer, domed sedimentary rocks eroded from above them.
Sills on the west flank of the Franklin Mountains were formed around 48 million years ago and consist
of trachyandesite, porphyritic trachyandesite, and monzodiorite (Barnes et al. 1991:1306-1307; Collins
and Raney 2000:4-7, 15). In the Hueco Mountains and their foothills, syenite and monzonite sills and
dikes were formed between 35 and ca. 33 million years ago (Wise 1977:40-41). Hueco Tanks is composed of porphyritic syenite, and was formed around 32.8 million years ago (Henry et al. 1986:6; cf.
Wise 1977:40, map). Other igneous intrusions in the vicinity include a plug called Cathedral or Black
Mountain located 3 miles to the northwest (Bentley 1995:Figure 2; Wise 1977:29), and Cerro Alto in the
Hueco Mountains 4 miles to the northeast (Wise 1977:30).
Hueco Tanks is a laccolith (dome-shaped) igneous intrusion (Wise 1977:37). The main magma
conduit apparently was North Mountain; molten rock then spread laterally in a sill now represented by
East Mountain, East Spur, and West Mountain (Knowles 2008:38). Three fracture sets on the rock hills
document geologic processes after the magma cooled. Deep cracks oriented northeast-southwest on the
crests of all but North Mountain were caused by regional compression while the rock was deeply buried.
As the porphyritic syenite was exposed by erosion, decompression formed low angle fractures paralleling the hilltops. North-south fractures on the east side of East Mountain and northeast end of East Spur
likely were caused by faulting or planes of weakness in the rock (Knowles 2008:21-26, 31-36).
Smaller features on the rock hills of Hueco Tanks were formed by weathering after the porphyritic
syenite was exposed, and possibly other processes. The numerous huecos or hollows on horizontal and
vertical surfaces developed in areas where salt from dust, rain, or soil penetrated tiny cracks or voids
in the rock. As the salt absorbed water and expanded it dislodged rock particles, leading to further salt
accumulation and exfoliation in those areas. Areas of the rock that are not eroded have developed a dark
surface patina composed of iron freed from the underlying rock by chemical weathering (Bourke and
Viles 2007:60-61; Garlick 2009:104-105; Richardson 1909:7).
The basin and range topography that characterizes the region today was formed by faulting between
30 and 24 million years ago. Downthrown fault blocks underlie basins like the Hueco Bolson, adjoined
by uplifted fault blocks that make up ranges like the Hueco and Franklin Mountains (Collins and Raney
2000:4, 6; Wise 1977:7, 19). Over the last 25 million years, sediments were eroded from these mountain
ranges and deposited in the Hueco Bolson. Known as the Santa Fe Group, they consist of colluvial,

alluvial fan, water-laid, and lake deposits (Gustavson 1991:3). The basin fill reaches a thickness of 9,000
ft adjacent to the Franklin Mountains but thins eastward to around 500 ft near the Hueco Mountains
(Collins and Raney 1991:14). The deep basin fill is not well known, but the middle and upper sediments
are designated as the Fort Hancock and Camp Rice Formations, respectively (Gustavson 1991:3). The
Fort Hancock Formation was deposited between 24 and 2.5 million years ago and is composed primarily of alluvial fan and ephemeral lake deposits, indicating a system of closed drainage basins (Gustavson
1991:3, 22-23).
The Camp Rice Formation dates from approximately 2.5 million to 600,000 years ago (Gustavson
1991:3). Sediments comprising this formation represent a variety of depositional environments, including wind-blown accumulations, ephemeral lakes, and braided stream channels (Gustavson 1991:31).
The main through-flowing stream was the ancestral Rio Grande, which formed when lake basins overflowed and became interconnected around 2 million years ago (Gustavson 1991:5). This river originally ran through Fillmore Pass between the Organ and Franklin Mountains into the southern Tularosa
Basin, and along the main axis of the Hueco Bolson (Church et al. 1996:16; Gustavson 1991:31). The
Rio Grande gravel unit of the Camp Rice Formation marks the main channel, and is up to 59 ft thick
(Church et al. 1996:16-17). On the margins of the basin near the Hueco and Franklin ranges, alluvial
fans began to cover the Camp Rice Formation as early as 1.6 million years ago (see Figure 5; Collins and
Raney 2000:11).
Around 600,000 years ago the Rio Grande shifted to its present course, running through the Paso del
Norte between the Franklin and Juarez Mountains and into the Hueco Bolson (Abbott et al. 1996:38).
Alluvial fans, river gravel and silt, and windblown sand from abandoned stream channels continued to
build up in the Hueco Bolson during this time (Gustavson 1991:5). Alluvial fans also were laid down
adjacent to the Hueco Mountains and other ranges between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago; Hueco
Tanks is on the upper part of a fan (see Figure 5) designated as the Jornada I geomorphic surface (Monger 1993:19, Figure III-20).
Recent deposits at Hueco Tanks are exposed in arroyo walls and were observed in shovel tests.
Their stratigraphy appears to conform to the Quaternary sedimentary units Q1 through Q4 that were
defined in the southern Tularosa Basin by Blair et al. (1990:175-200). The two deepest units are truncated soils. Q1 is capped by a calcium carbonate layer (K horizon, Stage III carbonate development)
that is up to 150 cm thick, and developed between 250,000 and 15,000 years ago (Blair et al. 1990:200,
210). Above it, Q2 is composed of red sand that dates to around 44,000 years ago at a minimum (Hall
2007:9-8), and is capped by a layer of calcium carbonate concretions (Btk horizon, Stage II carbonate
development) that is estimated to have accumulated between 15,000 and 9400 years ago (Blair et al.
1990:182, 199-200).
Cultural materials have been recovered at Hueco Tanks from the upper Q3 and basal Q4 sedimentary units. In basin settings, deposition of the eolian sand that composes Q3 began around 7300
years ago, and is dated through radiocarbon assays on archeological features buried in it (Blair et al.
1990:199). The soil that developed on the Q3 sands has a weak, darkened A horizon underlain by a Bk
horizon (Stage I carbonate development) with calcium carbonate filaments, root casts, and rare concretions (Blair et al. 1990:182, 199; Hall 2007:9-6). Development of this soil continued up to 100 years ago
(Blair et al. 1990:199).
The Q3 sedimentary unit correlates to the Organ alluvium, which was laid down between 6500 and
1100 years ago on alluvial fans originating from ranges on the basin margins (Blair et al. 1990:183, 199;
Gile et al. 1981; Monger 1993:28). Hueco Tanks apparently is in a pocket of Organ alluvium that is inset
into the late Pleistocene Jornada I alluvial fan. Archeological sites encompassed in Organ alluvium could

15

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

have buried, intact, stratified cultural deposits, and the oldest components may not be evident on the
surface (Miller 2009:10-10 through 10-12).
The Q4 sedimentary unit consists of sand loosened when vegetation was removed by overgrazing
(see below), and redeposited by wind. It typically is less than 50 cm thick except where coppice dunes
have formed. The Q4 unit was deposited within the past 100 years, and dune formation continues to the
present (Blair et al. 1990:182, 199; Hall 2007:9-9). At Hueco Tanks, Q4 sediments have piled up on the
west side of the rock hills and in other areas due to prevailing winds, but these windblown deposits are
relatively thin in comparison to the dune fields covering the basin floor to the west (Monger 1993:Figure
IV-2).

ROCK AND CLAY SOURCES
In the Hueco Bolson, materials for making chipped stone tools, grinding tools, and pottery are
available from a diverse array of sources. Rocks suitable for chipping occur in primary context in bedrock formations, and in secondary context in alluvial fans, along arroyos and streams, and in basins
(Church et al. 1996:137). In primary context, chert is the most commonly available chippable rock near
Hueco Tanks. A variety of chert types occur in nodules and beds that crop out in the Hueco Mountains
1 mile east of the park and in the low foothills 2 to 3 miles west of it, coming from limestone formations of the Permian Hueco Group, the Pennsylvanian Magdalena Group, and the Mississippian Rancheria Formation (Collins and Raney 2000:19-20; see Figure 5). Chert outcrops within 5 miles of the
park reportedly show evidence of prehistoric use as quarries (Martin and Sommer 1974:6). Around 7
miles west of Hueco Tanks, two lithic procurement sites have been located on the west flank of a Hueco
Mountain foothill, containing flaking debris from two types of coarse-grained chert nodules: reddishbrown with tan cortex, and bluish-gray with white fossil inclusions (Lukowski et al. 1999:221-223, 230;
Miller 2007:2-7).
Rock for making chipped stone tools also is available from relatively distant primary sources. About
28 miles to the north of Hueco Tanks in the foothills of the southern Sacramento Mountains, highquality chert can be obtained from the La Tuna, Lake Valley, Gobbler, and Beeman Formations (Church
et al. 1996:65-66). In the Franklin Mountains 24 miles to the west, the Rancheria and La Tuna Formations contain chert (Collins and Raney 2000:16-17). Quartzite is available on the east side of the
Franklin Mountains from the basal member of the Bliss Formation and the Lanoria Formation (Barnes
1983; Collins and Raney 2000:18). Rhyolite from the Thunderbird Group crops out on the crest of the
Franklin Mountains, and Soledad rhyolite comes from the southern Organ Mountains (Church et al.
1996:99).
Obsidian is the only commonly chipped stone that does not occur in primary context in the Hueco
Bolson. The closest major obsidian outcrops are located in north-central New Mexico on Mount Taylor
and Mount San Antonio, and in the Jemez Mountains (Church 2000:651, 664-666, 671).
Secondary sources of chippable stone in the Hueco Bolson are more widely available and include
gravelly slopes, alluvial fans, arroyos, gravel bars on streams, and erosional basins. Secondary source
areas tend to be localized, due to factors such as the geology, erosion, and ground surface visibility of the
immediate area (Church et al. 1996:137-151). Present-day and ancient gravel deposits of the Rio Grande
constitute major secondary sources. Where the original Rio Grande channel ran through the Hueco
Bolson, gravel deposits of the Camp Rice Formation contain locally-derived rhyolite, chert, and quartzite, as well as obsidian and other rocks that originate in the upper Rio Grande drainage basin (Church

16

Environmental Background

2000:669-670; Church et al. 1996:16-17, 145-148; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:233-234). These gravels
are exposed along limited areas of arroyo walls, fault scarps, and eroded slopes (Church 2000:650-651,
669). Gravel beds along the modern Rio Grandeâ23 miles southwest of Hueco Tanksâinclude the
same array of materials as the ancient river deposits, but the obsidian pebbles are more rare and generally larger (Church et al. 1996:78-80, 146).
Gravels also are exposed on the basin floor in blowouts and other eroded areas, but are predominantly small. A quantitative survey was made of gravel from a 5 square km area in the central bolson,
some 15 miles west-southwest of Hueco Tanks (Mauldin et al. 1998:78-79). Over 80 percent of the
sampled pebbles were less than 3 cm in maximum dimension, and only about 1 percent were larger
than 6 cm. The most abundant material was Organ (Soledad) rhyolite (50 percent), followed by miscellaneous granular stone (16 percent), miscellaneous chert (15 percent), and quartzite (12 percent), with
3 percent or less of chalcedony, basalt, Rancheria chert, obsidian, and Franklin (Thunderbird) rhyolite
(Mauldin et al. 1998:79). The predominance of Organ rhyolite suggests that the sample area overlies a
channel of the ancient Rio Grande.
Rock for making ground stone tools can be obtained from many geologic formations in the Hueco
Bolson. Most accessible is porphyritic syenite, which makes up the rock hills of Hueco Tanks (Wise
1977). Limestone is available from the Hueco Mountains and outlying foothills, located 1 to 3 miles
from the Tanks (see Figure 5). Sandstone can be obtained from the Bliss Formation in the Hueco Mountains; the closest outcrop is around 12 miles south of Hueco Tanks (Barnes 1983; Collins and Raney
2000:19-20). Granite is available from isolated outcrops that adjoin the south end of the Hueco Mountain range, ca. 18 miles south of Hueco Tanks (Barnes 1983).
Other rocks suitable for making ground stone tools must be obtained from more-distant sources like
the Franklin Mountains, around 24 miles west of Hueco Tanks. Quartzite is exposed on the east side of that
range at the base of the Bliss Formation and in the Lanoria Formation (Barnes 1983; Collins and Raney
2000:18). Rhyolite from the Thunderbird Group crops out on the crest of the Franklins, while Soledad
rhyolite comes from the southern Organ Mountains (Church et al. 1996:99). Granite and basalt come
from peaks at the south end of the Franklins and the east flank of that range (Collins and Raney 2000:18).
Clay suitable for pottery making is available in a variety of settings across the Hueco Bolson, including playas, terraces of the modern and ancient Rio Grande, and distal alluvial fans (Bentley 1992a:374;
Brook 1979a; Church et al. 1996:143). Although a number of clay samples have been submitted for
chemical analysis, few have been directly matched to prehistoric pottery. The array of elements in the
prehistoric ceramics of the Hueco Bolson suggests that they were made of clays derived from igneous
rocks, however (Dulaney and Pigott 1977:269, 285; Myles Miller, personal communication 2006). Preliminary chemical analyses (Bentley 1992a:393-394, 1995) indicated that clay from the igneous intrusion named Cerro Alto (located 4 miles northeast of Hueco Tanks, see Figure 5) was used in ceramics
on sites in the eastern Hueco Bolson, but this remains to be substantiated. A playa located ca. 6 miles
northwest of Hueco Tanks near the Hot Well site has a considerable accumulation of fine-grained sediment and also could have been a clay source (Brook 1979a).

SOILS
The soils in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site are composed of porphyritic syenite, quartzose sand, and sediment derived from limestone (Worthington 1996a:1). Mapped associations are Pajarito, Simona, Wink, and Mimbres; some nearby areas are identified to the Agustin association (Figure 6;

alkaline (Jaco 1971:19-31).
Over 50 percent of the level ground in the parkâincluding the basins between the hillsâis identified as the Pajarito association of deep fine sandy loam (see Figure 6). The surface layer (A horizon)

18

Environmental Background

of this soil is pinkish gray and typically is around 18 inches (46 cm) thick. The subsoil (B horizon) is
light brown with a few calcium carbonate threads, and usually extends to a depth of 36 inches (91 cm).
The A and B horizons may contain up to 15 percent limestone and/or igneous pebbles by volume. The
underlying unaltered C horizon is light yellowish brown and has a few calcium carbonate threads and
concretions (Jaco 1971:28).
Simona association gravelly loam is limited to the north end of the park (see Figure 6). The surface
layer (A horizon) consists of light brownish gray gravelly loam that typically is 3 inches (8 cm) thick;
30 percent of its volume consists of cemented caliche and limestone fragments up to 2 inches (5 cm) in
maximum dimension. The pale brown gravelly fine sandy loam subsoil (B horizon) usually extends to
a depth of about 16 inches (41 cm), and around 30 percent of its volume is caliche and limestone fragments or pebbles. The underlying unaltered C horizon is an indurated caliche layer (Jaco 1971:28-29).
Wink association soil is moderately deep fine sandy loam, mapped near the southwest corner of the
park (see Figure 6). The surface layer (A horizon) is pale brown and typically is about 6 inches (15 cm)
thick. The subsoil (B horizon) is light yellowish brown, contains a few calcium carbonate threads and
concretions, and usually extends to a depth of around 24 inches (61 cm). The underlying unaltered C
horizon is strongly cemented caliche (Jaco 1971:30-31).
Mimbres association deep silt loam has developed in shallow watercourses and playas, and is mapped
in three areas of the park: along the south boundary fence, on the east side of North Mountain, and on
the northeast side of East Mountain (see Figure 6). The surface layer (A horizon) is light brownish gray
silt loam and typically is about 8 inches (20 cm) thick; clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent. The
subsoil (B horizon) is brown silt loam, which includes a few calcium carbonate threads and extends to a
depth of around 50 inches (127 cm). The underlying unaltered C horizon is pale brown loam with a few
fine calcium carbonate concretions. Mimbres is the only soil association in the park that has moderately
slow permeability, and it holds water for three to seven days after rains. This association produces the
most range forage of any soil in El Paso County (Jaco 1971:27).
Near the park are linear areas of Agustin association soilâdeep, pale brown gravelly loam that adjoins
arroyos on alluvial fans at the base of limestone and igneous outcrops. This soil delineates two major
arroyos carrying runoff from the Hueco Mountains: the largest flows along the south fence of the park,
and the other is around 200 ft (61 m) north of state property (see Figure 6). The surface layer (A horizon)
of Agustin soil typically is around 12 inches (30 cm) thick, and 20 to 30 percent of its volume is composed
of pebbles and cobbles that are up to 3 inches (8 cm) in maximum dimension. The subsoil (B horizon)
usually extends to a depth of around 30 inches (76 cm) and includes a few fine calcium carbonate threads;
25 percent of its volume consists of limestone pebbles coated with caliche. The underlying unaltered C
horizon is very gravelly loam that consists of up to 50 percent pebbles by volume (Jaco 1971:19-20).

SURFACE HYDROLOGY
Hueco Tanks is located on the edge of the Hueco Bolson, an extensive basin that is internally drained.
Surface water in the basin is extremely scarce (Anschuetz et al. 1990:9). Rainfall and runoff from the
adjacent mountain ranges flow toward the center of the basin through alluvial fan drainage networks,
and pond in playas (shallow depressions) at the base of the fans, where less permeable sediments have
accumulated at the mouths of major channels (Blair et al. 1990:201-203). These ephemeral lakes are filled
by heavy rains during the late summer and early fall, and retain water for a few days to several months
before losing it to evaporation (Carmichael 1986:36; Seaman et al. 1988:21). Several substantial playas

19

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

are located near the Tanks, or are believed to have existed in prehistoric times: one 6.5 miles northwest
at Hot Well (Scarborough 1988:36), another 9 miles west at Nations East Well (Miller 2007:12-2 through
12-3), and a third 8 miles south-southwest near Sabina Mountain (Brook 1980:15-17).
Natural water sources in and near Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site consist of alluvial fan
drainages, marshy areas where water accumulates, runoff from the rock hills, and natural rock reservoirs. Additional water sources that have been created by humans are discussed in other sections of
the report: prehistoric and historic dams are described in the Features, Structures, and Distributions
section, while alterations to the hydrology in the recent past are reviewed in this section under Historic
Land Use (below).
Runoff water from the west flank of the Hueco Mountains is delivered to Hueco Tanks by a network
of channels that drain the alluvial fan. The Tanks are positioned between large arroyos to the north and
south, which carry runoff from major canyons in the range (see Figures 4 and 6). Channels on alluvial
fans carry runoff for some time after rains; moisture is retained in soils near them and in areas where the
water ponds (Mauldin 1995:173-174). Drainages originating on the west side of the Hueco Mountains
flow toward the center of the Hueco Bolson, where the water eventually sinks into the sands or is lost to
evaporation.
Marshy areas or cienegas were once present at Hueco Tanks, based on plant and mollusk remains
found in those areas (Bryan et al. 1999:16). The largest cienegas probably coincided with areas now
identified to the relatively clayey Mimbres soil association (see Figure 6); they still hold water after
heavy rains, despite alterations from modern land use. A seasonally wet pond was once located between
North and East Mountains (see Figure 2), as indicated by freshwater snail shells recovered at depth in
the present-day arroyo (Freehling and Weise 1976:23; Worthington 1996a:60-61). Smaller seasonal wetlands are scattered through the rock hills, indicated by patches of plants growing in moist soils. Typically
situated at drainage heads, many of these areas are currently dry as a result of land use, but would have
been seasonally wet in prehistoric times (David Riskind, personal communication 2006).
The porphyritic syenite hills that comprise Hueco Tanks collect rainwater in fissures. As it is carried down by gravity, the water carves shallow channels into the rocks, marked by dark stains. When
channeled water reaches the base of the rock hills it creates patches of moist soil that support mature
trees. During the rainy season the channels carry flows ranging from rivulets to waterfalls (e.g., Davis
1972a:2). Similar channels enclosed in the rock hills are evidenced by audible trickling and dripping
after rains.
The myriad natural reservoirs for which Hueco Tanks is named are formed when rainfall and runoff are captured in cracks and hollows (huecos in Spanish) in the rock. Some of these features are open
to the air, while others are sheltered by rocks. They hold water for periods ranging from several days
to several months, depending on their size, depth, and exposure to evaporation. One notable group of
huecos is called Honeycomb Pond, located on an outlying rock mass between East Mountain, East Spur,
and West Mountain (see Figure 2). A natural pond may have been present in a canyon on the west side
of North Mountain (see Figure 2), where a dam later was built to impound Laguna Prieta (see Features,
Structures, and Distributions).

CLIMATE AND PALEOCLIMATE
The semiarid climate of the Hueco Bolson is characterized by significant seasonal and annual variations in temperature, precipitation, and wind, as evidenced by the meteorological record for El Paso.

20

Environmental Background

Summers generally are long and hot, with around 104 days reaching a maximum temperature of 90Â°F
or higher; winters typically are short and cool, with 65 days dropping to a minimum temperature of
32Â°F or lower on average (Ramos 1999:88). The record high of 114Â°F was set in July 1994, and the record
low of 8Â°F below zero occurred in January 1962 (Ramos 1999:88). The average length of the frost-free
(growing) season in El Paso County is 248 days, typically beginning in early March and ending in mid
November (Jaco 1971:57).
The average annual precipitation for El Paso County is 8 inches, but yearly rainfall is highly
variable; 1891 is the driest year on record with only 2.2 inches, and 1884 is the wettest at 18.3 inches
(Jaco 1971:57). Over 50 percent of the annual precipitation usually falls during the monsoon season
which extends from July through October, when thunderstorms bring heavy rain and occasional
flooding (Dering et al. 2001:60-61). Winter rainfall is less abundant but is not as susceptible to loss
through evaporation (Kemp 1983:433). Winter/spring rainfall has a critical impact on the effective
length of the growing season, because the soil must be sufficiently hydrated to support plant germination in the spring (Kemp 1983:431; Mauldin 1995:134-136). In general, much of the precipitation
falls so rapidly that it does not infiltrate the soil, resulting in high-energy runoff events (Abbott et
al. 1996:14).
The low humidity and abundant sunshine of this region result in an evaporation rate that is up to
12 times greater than the annual precipitation (Dering et al. 2001:61). Lake basins in El Paso County
experience evaporation rates of around 72 inches per year on average (Jaco 1971:57). March and April
are the driest months and also have the highest and most sustained winds, causing dust and sand storms
that blanket the basins with eolian deposits (Blair et al. 1990:171, 182). Prevailing winds are from the
west except during the summer monsoon season, when they originate from the east to southeast (Blair
et al. 1990:170-172).
The paleoclimatic sequence of the Hueco Bolson has been approximated through pack rat midden
analyses and other proxy data; since the late Pleistocene, the trend is toward increasing temperatures
and decreasing precipitation (Abbott et al. 1996:41-43, 154). Prior to 12,000 years ago temperatures
were milder than they are today, with cooler summers, warmer winters, and greater rainfall, most falling
in the winter (Van Devender 1990:124-125). Around 12,000 years ago, summer temperatures began to
rise and a monsoon season started to develop (Van Devender 1990:126). By 9,000 to 8,000 years ago,
summer temperatures had increased and precipitation had shifted to a dominant summer monsoonal
pattern, while the frequency of severe winter freezes increased (Dick-Peddie et al. 1993:16; Monger
1993:91; Van Devender 1990:126; Van Devender and Riskind 1979:138). A period of aridity occurred
between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, based on the age of a widespread deflation surface that represents
a major erosional episode (Monger and Buck 1995:34-36). The modern climatic regime was established
by around 4,000 years ago, with fewer winter freezes and adequate summer rainfall, punctuated by more
frequent droughts (Van Devender 1990:126).
Tree ring data from southern New Mexico (Grissino-Meyer et al. 1997; Mauldin 1995) reflect smallscale climatic fluctuations over the past 2,000 years. A relatively cool and moist interval occurred between
A.D. 400 and 700, based on decreased variation in tree ring widths. A warm-dry period from A.D. 700
to 1040 culminated in a severe drought between A.D. 940 and 1040. The climate was relatively cool and
moist between A.D. 1040 and 1210, followed by a period of below-average rainfall from A.D. 1210 to
1305, and ending in a severe drought between A.D. 1272 and 1296. Climatic conditions became less variable after A.D. 1300. Precipitation increased considerably, and was particularly abundant between A.D.
1355 and 1400. Severe but short-term droughts occurred between A.D. 1405 and 1410, and 1445 and
1450 (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997:49-62; Mauldin 1995:159-166).

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

VEGETATION
The vegetation of the Hueco Bolson is classified generally as Chihuahuan desertscrub (Powell
1998:1-3; Van Devender 1990:105). Distribution of modern plant communities in this region is controlled by moisture, temperature, and elevation: desertscrub grows on the basin floor, grasslands on
intermediate surfaces, and woodland communities at higher elevations (Dick-Peddie et al. 1993:27).
Hueco Tanks is on an intermediate surface that is covered by desertscrub and degraded desert grassland,
but because its igneous-derived soils hold water more effectively than soils in the surrounding area, the
plant community in the park includes a number of woody and water-dependent species (Bryan et al.
1999:16; Van Devender and Riskind 1979:138).
Around 30,000 years ago the northern Chihuahuan desert was covered by pinyon-juniper-oak
woodland; disappearance of pinyon between 12,000 and 10,800 years ago marked the beginning of
a vegetation shift (Van Devender 1990:117, 121). Grassland communities were established by around
7,500 years ago (Van Devender and Spaulding 1979:707) and had appeared much earlier, as indicated by
soil isotope data (Monger and Buck 1995:60) and sage (Artemisia spp.) pollen dating to around 10,100
years ago from a packrat midden at Hueco Tanks (Hall and Riskind 2010:727-728). Between 8,300 and
8,100 years ago, Hueco Mountain packrat middens were dominated by honey mesquite and prickly
pear, indicating a shift to desertscrub (Van Devender 1990:117). Ocotillo, lechuguilla, and creosotebush
appeared between 4,200 and 3,700 years ago, and the transition to an essentially modern desertscrub
community was complete by around 3,600 years ago (Van Devender 1990:117, 121-122).
In the mid nineteenth century, black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda) and other grasses covered the
basin floor (Gibbens et al. 2005:665). After ranching was introduced to the Hueco Bolson around 1885,
this marginal desert grassland was destroyed by overgrazing. Desertscrub speciesâparticularly honey
mesquiteâpresently dominate the northern Chihuahuan desert, and were widely propagated by means
of seeds dispersed in cattle droppings (Blair et al. 1990:200; Dick-Peddie et al. 1993:131; Hall 1990:399;
Van Devender 1990:117).
The distinctive prehistoric vegetation of Hueco Tanks is known through fossil plant remains from
packrat middens, which are constituted primarily of vegetation within 100 ft of the location where they
were deposited (Finley 1990:35). Around 13,500 years ago, packrat midden data indicate that the Tanks
supported a pinyon-juniper-oak woodland including woody plants that no longer grow at the park,
such as Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis), Toumey oak (Quercus toumeyi), currant (Ribes cf. montigenum),
and snowberry (Symphoricarpos sp.; Van Devender and Riskind 1979:133, 137). Vole (Microtus sp.) teeth
from the midden indicate that grasses were a component of the woodland (Van Devender and Riskind
1979:137). By around 9,400 years ago the pinyon was gone and a juniper-oak woodland had developed
(Van Devender and Riskind 1979:137). This woodland has persisted up to the present due to the greater
moisture retention of the igneous-derived soils at Hueco Tanks (Van Devender and Riskind 1979:138).
Most of the existing stands of juniper are quite old and do not appear to be reproducing (Bryan et al.
1999:17), except a few trees near a seasonal pond in Mescalero Canyon (Wanda Olszewski, personal
communication 2007). Desert scrub species are a relatively recent addition to the plant community in
the park (Van Devender and Riskind 1979:135-136).
The modern vegetation of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site (Worthington 1980, 1996a)
also is quite diverse. The community includes species typical of desert, mountain, aquatic, and grassland
habitats. A total of 406 vascular plants in 91 families have been documented, along with 32 mosses, 31
lichens, and 2 liverworts (Worthington 1996a).

22

Environmental Background

The level terrain surrounding the igneous outcrops is dominated by a desertscrub/grassland community
including creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), tarbush (Flourensia
cernua), soaptree and datil yucca (Yucca elata, baccata), ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens), lechuguilla (Agave
lechuguilla), sotol (Dasylirion leiophyllum), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), prickly pear (Opuntia spp.),
Mammillaria heyderi, and other cacti. Grama grasses (Bouteloua spp.), goosefoot (Chenopodium spp.),
and amaranth (Amaranthus spp.) grow near the rocks, while fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), and
threeawn (Aristida spp.) and other grasses are widespread on the flats. Shrubby stands of honey mesquite,
catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii), lotebush (Ziziphus obtusifolia), agarito (Berberis trifoliolata), javelinabush
(Condalia ericoides), and wildbuckwheat (Eriogonum spp.) flourish in disturbed areas (Bryan et al. 1999:17).
Trees are concentrated along the base of the rock hills where runoff forms small water catchments,
and in narrow canyons that provide greater moisture due to increased shade and lower evaporation
(Dick-Peddie et al. 1993:29, 31). They include netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), Texas mulberry
(Morus microphylla), oreganillo (Aloysia wrightii), Wright silktassel (Garrya wrightii), Mexican buckeye
(Ungnadia speciosa), Arizona white oak (Quercus arizonica), and rose-fruited juniper (Juniperus coahuilensis; Bryan et al. 1999:17). The juniper, oak, and hackberry are relict components of the woodland that
covered Hueco Tanks and similar locations in the late Pleistocene and early Holocene (Van Devender
and Riskind 1979:138).
Water-dependent plants are found in moist soils near dams and seeps, and in shaded fissures. These
include leafy pondweed (Potamogeton foliosus), hairy pepperwort (Marsilea vestita), slender rush (Juncus tenuis), Rio Grande cottonwood (Populus deltoides wislizeni), and Goodding willow (Salix gooddingii; Bryan et al. 1999:17).
No federally listed endangered or threatened plants have been found at Hueco Tanks, but four species are considered rare, localized, and/or otherwise sensitive (Worthington 1996b, 1997). The park contains the only known U.S. population of erect colubrina (Colubrina stricta), a shrub of the buckthorn
family (Hedges and Poole 2000). A tall, spindly shrub of the mallow family (Abutilon mollicomum) is
found at two locations in the park, which may represent its only occurrence in Texas (Worthington
1996b). It grows principally in Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico, and in adjacent Arizona and New Mexico. Mosquito plant (Agastache cana) of the mint family is confined primarily to rocky slopes, crevices,
and ledges in the western Trans-Pecos and adjacent New Mexico. This perennial herb is quite limited in
distribution but is fairly widespread at Hueco Tanks. Mexican holly fern (Phanerophlebia auriculata) is
extremely localized in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, and survives in about 10
shaded fissures at Hueco Tanks; its only other recorded occurrence in Texas is in the Guadalupe Mountains (Bryan et al. 1999:18-19).

FAUNA
Due to its varied habitats and relatively abundant vegetation and water sources, Hueco Tanks currently supports a diverse animal community including species from desert scrubland, grassland, and
mountainous environments. The animals hunted by the prehistoric occupants of Hueco Tanks reflect
these diverse habitats, as known through faunal remains from Hueco Tanks Village that date between
A.D. 1000 and 1300 (Davidson 1982). The Hueco Tanks fauna is substantially more abundant and
diverse than the fauna of the surrounding desert flats.
Forty-two mammal species have been documented at the park through observation of live specimens and/or archeological recovery of their bones (Davidson 1982: Johnson 2000:15-25; Worthington

23

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

1996a:86-93). Archeological evidence has been recovered of three ungulate species that were hunted
by past occupants: bison (Bos bison), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), and mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus; Davidson 1982:75). Collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu) is the only ungulate documented in
recent studies (Johnson 2000:22-23). Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) are not included in live or
archeological collections from the park but probably were in the area in prehistoric times; distinctive
curved-horn animals are depicted on at least eight rock imagery panels (Kirkland 1940:10; Kirkland
and Newcomb 1967), and bighorn sheep remains were recovered from a cave in the Hueco Mountains
(Creel 1997:86).
Carnivores are the black bear (Ursus americanus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), coyote (Canis latrans), badger (Taxidea taxus), ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), striped skunk
(Mephitis mephitis), mountain lion (Felis concolor), and raccoon (Procyon lotor); although the latter two
species are from archeological collections, mountain lions and raccoons have been spotted in the park
recently (Wanda Olszewski, personal communication 2007). Western spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis)
also have frequented the park of late (Tim Roberts, personal communication 2009). Three rabbit species
currently inhabit the park and also were recovered from excavations: the black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), and eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus cf. floridanus)
(Davidson 1982: Johnson 2000:15-25; Worthington 1996a:86-93).
Small mammals include 20 rodents that are known from live or archeological collections, ranging from porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) to white-throated woodrat (packrat; Neotoma albigula) and
southern plains wood rat (Neotoma micropus). Rock squirrels (Spermophilus variegatus) have been
observed in the park but have not been formally documented (Bryan et al. 1999:23). Vole (Microtus
sp.) teeth were recovered from a late Pleistocene packrat midden at Hueco Tanks; the nearest modern
populations are in the Sacramento and Guadalupe Mountains (Van Devender and Riskind 1979:137).
Six species of bats occupy cracks and crevices in the rock hills (Dooley 1974; Worthington 1996a:86-87).
Hueco Tanks supports a diverse community of birds; 211 species have been recorded, including
several rare birds (Bryan et al. 1999:22; Zimmer 1996). Forty-four birds are known or suspected to
breed at the park, including the prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia),
white-throated swift (Aeronautes saxatalis), black-chinned hummingbird (Archilochus alexandri), ashthroated flycatcher (Myiarchus cinerascens), Crissal thrasher (Toxostoma crissale), blue grosbeak (Passerina caerulea), Scottâs oriole (Icterus parisorum), and lesser goldfinch (Spinus psaltria). Mourning
dove (Zenaida macroura) and greater roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus) have been documented in
archeological collections (Davidson 1982:75). During migration periods, 31 species of wading birds,
waterfowl, and shorebirds have been observed at the park, attracted by the water sources. Many migratory songbirds pass through Hueco Tanks during spring and fall, including 19 warblers, and in winter
the park hosts up to 20 sparrow species (Bryan et al. 1999:22).
Thirty-four reptile species have been recorded in the park, including 17 lizards, 5 rattlesnakes,
10 non-poisonous snakes, and 2 turtles (Johnson 2000:18-20; Worthington 1996a:71-74). The Texas
horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum) is a candidate for federal listing as endangered or threatened,
and has been listed as threatened at the state level. All five of the rattlesnakes native to the Trans-Pecos
have been recorded in the park: blacktail (Crotalus molossus), Mojave (C. scutulatus), mottled rock (C.
lepidus), western diamondback (C. atrox), and prairie (C. viridis); the latter two also are represented in
archeological collections (Bryan et al. 1999:21; Davidson 1982:75). Of the 10 non-poisonous snakes,
the most common is the western blackneck garter snake (Thamnophis cyrtopsis), which frequents moist
areas (Bryan et al. 1999:22). The remains of two turtles have been recovered from archeological excavations: desert box turtle (Terrapene ornata) and softshell turtle (Trionyx sp.; Davidson 1982:75); the latter
was almost certainly imported from a riverine habitat (Worthington 1996a:72).

Seven amphibian species have been documented at the park: the barred tiger salamander (Ambystoma
tigrinum), three toads (Bufo punctatus, B. cognatus, and B. debilis), and three spadefoot toads (Spea
bombifrons, S. multiplicatus, and Scaphiopus couchi) (Johnson 2000:17; Worthington 1996a:71). These
species are associated with wetland habitats (Bryan et al. 1999:21) but range out into the flats (Johnson
2000:17).

HISTORIC LAND USE
Within the past 150 years, human activities have significantly affected the cultural resources of
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site (see Historical Background). The most extensive impacts have
involved construction of dams, earthen berms, and canals to capture water, a practice that occurred on a
much smaller scale during prehistoric times (see Features and Structures). Other types of construction,
trail/road use, visitation, and vandalism also have damaged the cultural resources of the park.
The earliest recorded water tank apparently was built in 1858 at the Butterfield Overland Mail
stage station (Conkling and Conkling 1947:I:410); its location is uncertain. Between 1898 and 1950, the
Escontrias family constructed 15 earthen and masonry dams on their ranch at the Tanks. Most of these
dams survive to the present day, and eight still hold water (see Features, Structures, and Distributions).
An extensive drainage diversion system was built by developers between 1960 and 1963, in an
attempt to create a lake between the rock hills. A large earthen dam was constructed on the west side
of the basin between North and West Mountains (El Paso Herald-Post, March 17, 1960). The sediments
used to build it were obtained from a nearby Escontrias ranch dam and a borrow pit on the adjacent
basin floor, where a prehistoric village reputedly had been located (Roberts 2005a:54). Several diversion
structures were built to direct water into the central basin. A berm located southeast of the present-day
park gathered water from a major arroyo and sent it north to a location between North and East Mountains, where a 1,500 ft (457 m) long berm directed the flow west into the basin. Another canal carried
water from the northeast corner of the property southwest into the tank behind the Escontrias ranch
house (Bryan et al. 1999:45-47, Figure 11; Miles 1984:69). Despite the scale of this effort, the large dam
has rarely held water.
As this ill-conceived drainage system failed, its breached structures directed high-velocity water
flows into areas of the park where the natural drainages were insufficient to carry them. The most
severely eroded area is the deep gully cut between North and East Mountains, initially intended to direct
flow into the central basin. An unimproved road between East Spur and West Mountain also channeled
runoff and became an arroyo, converging with a road on the southeast side of West Mountain to form
a web of deep gullies. Arroyos in these areas average about 16 ft (5 m) wide and have cut from 1.6 to 13
ft (0.5 to 4 m) deep (Bryan et al. 1999:46).
The earliest historic structure at Hueco Tanks was the Butterfield stage station, the remains of which
are no longer evident. Between 1898 and 1956, three buildings comprising the Escontrias ranch complex
were built on the northeast side of North Mountain; they are still standing, though two are in ruins. By
1944, a landing strip for small aircraft had been bulldozed across the north end of the park; measuring
ca. 2,000 ft (610 m) long by 100 ft (30 m) wide, it apparently was used for military training exercises (see
Historical Background). By 1955, a USGS topographic map notes that the strip had been abandoned.
Two pipeline corridors cross the park. On the north and northwest side of the property, a 100 ft (30
m) wide easement was granted in 1959 (El Paso County Deed Records 1495:95), and a petroleum pipeline was laid within it. Approximately 3,280 ft (1,000 m) of the corridor crosses state property (Bryan et

25

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

al. 1999:14, Figure A-5). The pipeline was reworked in 1995, but in 1996 it ruptured while a telephone
line was being installed in the corridor (Ing and Bryan 1996). Cleanup of the gasoline spill required
excavation of a 1,500 by 30 ft (457 by 9 m) area to a depth of around 20 ft (6 m; Miller 1996a). At the
southwest corner of the property, a natural gas pipeline runs within an easement granted in 1969 (El
Paso County Deed Records 220:881), and crosses around 250 ft (76 m) of state property (Bryan et al.
1999:Figure A-5).
Construction during the 1960s related to housing and recreational developments caused damage to
the area that was to become a state park. In the early 1960s, a grid of streets was bulldozed for a proposed
subdivision south of Hueco Tanks. Two 66 ft (20 m) wide corridors cut across what is now state propertyâone from the south end of West Mountain to the south end of East Spur and the second along
the south boundaryâconnected by four 33 ft (10 m) wide strips. The subdivision was never built, and
the bulldozed corridors are partially overgrown with vegetation. Recreational development had begun
by 1957, when three old army barracks were hauled into the area north of the Escontrias ranch house,
and a cafÃ© and bar were opened (Miles 1984:69). Use of this area reached a peak in 1964, when the barracks were fashioned into a ghost town housing a restaurant, with nearby riding stables (El Paso Times,
October 4, 1964).
Public visitation to Hueco Tanks began soon after the Escontrias ranch was established in 1898, and
has damaged cultural resources. In 1916 the family closed the area to the public (El Paso Herald, June
2, 1916), but it was soon reopened and visitation continued to increase. Use of the Hueco Tanks area
for military training in the 1940s and 1950s brought additional pedestrian and vehicle traffic (Escontrias and Escontrias 1996). Visitation levels and related damage peaked in the 1990s, when unrestricted
access to the park resulted in erosion of archeological deposits and damage to vegetation (Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department 2000:3). The negative effect of pedestrian traffic is illustrated by the loss of 10
moss species that had been recorded at Hueco Tanks in 1954 but could not be found by 1989, having
been destroyed by trampling (Worthington 1989:3).
Vandalism to the cultural resources of Hueco Tanksâparticularly rocksheltersâprobably began in
the early twentieth century when the rock imagery was publicized in newspaper accounts. By the 1950s,
some of the panels had been covered by soot from campfires, and private organizations had erected
signs asking visitors not to deface the rock art (El Paso Times, December 13, 1955). Looting was rampant
during the 1960s when ownership of the property changed hands frequently; visitors removed bags
of pottery sherds and at times, entire pots (Dallas Times Herald, May 23, 1982; Myles Miller, personal
communication 1999). Vandalism diminished when the state park opened in May 1970 and personnel
were stationed on the property. A sharp increase in damage to rock imagery occurred in the late 1990s,
caused by purposeful vandalism and the inadvertent effects of Hueco Tanksâ increasing popularity as a
boulder climbing destination. These impacts were substantially reduced in 1998 when a public use plan
was enacted that instituted mandatory visitor orientations, limited the number of visitors in certain
areas, and allowed access to sensitive areas only when accompanied by trained guides (Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department 1998, 2000).
The present-day facilities of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site were constructed in the 1970s,
and include a headquarters building, two residences, and a maintenance compound. Twenty campsites,
a restroom, and a 40-seat amphitheater were built on the northeast side of East Mountain. Restrooms
also are located on the northwest and north sides of North Mountain, and a self-composting toilet
recently was installed in the central basin. The park contains 3.1 miles of paved roads and 6 miles of
designated hiking trails, 2 miles of which are surfaced with crushed rock.

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND

by Margaret Howard and Logan McNatt

This section provides information on three topics: Native American culture history in the Hueco
Bolson, significant archeological sites in the vicinity of Hueco Tanks, and previous investigations at the
state park and historic site. Initially, the Native American cultural sequence for the region is delineated,
for it will serve as a framework for interpretation of current data from the park. Several archeological sites located near the park are then reviewed, due to the likelihood that they influenced and were
influenced by prehistoric occupations at the Tanks. The section concludes with a synopsis of previous
investigations in the state park and historic site, which represent the state of knowledge of the parkâs
prehistory prior to the current investigations. The findings of investigations at Hueco Tanks Village are
reviewed in a separate section.

NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE HISTORY
Hueco Tanks is located near the center of a cultural area designated as the Jornada Branch of the
Mogollon, which extends from Carrizozo, New Mexico to Villa Ahumada in the state of Chihuahua,
Mexico, and stretches from ca. 150 miles east to 75 miles west of El Paso (Lehmer 1948:9-11, 71). The
Native American record in the Jornada Mogollon area is divided into four major cultural-historical
periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, Formative, and Protohistoric. In this review, information on the time
spans and cultural characteristics of these periods has been drawn primarily from Lehmer (1948), Miller
(2006, 2007), and Miller and Kenmotsu (2004). Written accounts of Native American activities at Hueco
Tanks after 1598 are considered in the Historical Background section of this report.
Paleoindian
Although traces of human activities dating back to 50,000 years ago reportedly were recovered from
deep strata in Pendejo Cave in south-central New Mexico (Chrisman et al. 1996; MacNeish and Libby
2003), the identification, integrity, and age of those deposits have not been proven conclusively (e.g.,
Dincauze 1997; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:211-212; Shaffer and Baker 1997). The earliest clear-cut
evidence of human presence in the Jornada Mogollon area dates to around 10,000 B.C. and marks the
beginning of the Paleoindian period, which continued until 6000 B.C. (Miller 2006:13). This 4,000 year
span is divided into early and late periods that are thought to indicate different subsistence adaptations,
identified by projectile point styles: Clovis and Folsom points represent the early Paleoindian period,
while Plainview, Scottsbluff, and other lanceolate points indicate the late Paleoindian period (Carmichael
1986:7-8; Miller 2006:14). Other chipped stone tools associated with Paleoindian components include
transverse end scrapers (unifacial scrapers with arc-shaped working edges) and denticulate tools (Miller
27

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

and Kenmotsu 2004:216). Most Paleoindian artifacts in the region are mixed with materials from later
occupations or exposed in lag contexts on deflated surfaces, due to extensive eolian disturbance (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004:216); components dating to this period also may be deeply buried in Q3 sediments
(see Environmental Background; Hall 2007:9-13).
Early Paleoindian
The early part of the Paleoindian period is 1,800 years long, extending from 10,000 to 8200 B.C.
(Miller 2006:13). This time span is estimated based on the age of Clovis and Folsom projectile points
in dated contexts in other areas, as no early Paleoindian components in the region have been firmly
dated (Miller 2006:14). Clovis points were made between 10,000 and 9,000 B.C. (Miller 2006:13), and
are rarely found in the region (Bever and Meltzer 2007:73-74). Only one Clovis point has been reported
from the Hueco Bolson (Krone 1976), and its identification is not certain (Carmichael 1986:7).
Folsom points were used from ca. 9000 to 8200 B.C. (Haynes et al. 1992:96; Miller 2006:13, 15) and
are considerably more common. In the Tularosa Basin north of Hueco Tanks, most Folsom projectile
points and preforms are made of local raw materials (58 percent Rancheria chert and 27 percent Rio
Grande gravel) although in a few assemblages, over 25 percent of the points are composed of nonlocal
Edwards chert (Amick 1996:414-415). The distribution of these material types and the low ratio of complete points to preforms indicate that broken points made of nonlocal stone were frequently replaced
with points made from local stone sources (Amick 1996:416; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:216-217).
Large territories and short occupations are thought to have characterized Folsom land use in the
Basin and Range province and adjacent regions (Amick 1996:423). Folsom hunters apparently wintered
in the Rio Grande valley, and then geared up at Edwards chert sources to exploit the Southern Plains
grasslands during the summer and early fall (Amick 1996:417). Intensive use of Tularosa Basin stone
sources suggests that the basin was a repeatedly occupied hunting territory, while a lesser number of
points made of Edwards chert from over 300 miles away may indicate the extensive range of these
groups (Amick 1996:415). Although the Bison antiquus remains found at Folsom sites represent a key
food resource, subsistence at the small sites in the Basin and Range country apparently included a wide
range of animals and plants (Amick 1996:412, 421).
Most of the Early Paleoindian sites in the Jornada Mogollon area appear to be short-term residential
camps, positioned at locations offering an overview of the surrounding area and ready access to water.
Ca. 20 miles northwest of Hueco Tanks, Folsom points were found in sites LA93330, LA93331, and
LA93336, located on a ridge above an intermittent drainage in the Tularosa Basin (Stuart 1997:54-59).
Folsom points were clustered around Three Buttesâbedrock outcrops overlooking several large playas
located ca. 15.5 miles north of Hueco Tanks (Carmichael 1986:8, 211; Krone 1975). Ca. 80 miles north
of the Tanks in the San Andres Mountains, a campsite containing Clovis and Folsom points and numerous end scrapers was situated on an alluvial fan at the mouth of Rhodes Canyon (Beckett 1983). In a
similar setting ca. 18 miles south-southeast of Hueco Tanks, early Paleoindian tools and Folsom points
were found in sites 41HZ504 and 41HZ505, positioned on the upper Hueco Mountain alluvial fan near
an arroyo flowing from Padre Canyon (Staley and Turnbow 1995:155-182, 189).
Temperatures during the early Paleoindian period were milder than they are today, with cooler
summers, warmer winters, and greater rainfall, most falling in the winter (Van Devender 1990:124125). The northern Chihuahuan desert was covered by pinyon-juniper-oak woodland, but the pinyon
disappeared between 10,000 and 8800 B.C., marking the onset of a vegetation shift (Van Devender

28

Prehistoric Background

1990:117, 121). At the same time, summer temperatures started to rise and a monsoon season began to
develop (Van Devender 1990:126).
Late Paleoindian
The late Paleoindian period is 2,200 years long, extending from 8200 to 6000 B.C. (Miller 2006:13).
A variety of dart point forms were used during this period, bearing distinctive parallel flaking and collectively assigned to the Plano and Cody complexes (Carmichael 1986:8; Miller 2006:16). Late Paleoindian
projectile points include Plainview and Scottsbluff, which date between 8500 and 6000 B.C. (Carmichael
1986:8; Miller 2006:13, 16). Sites dating to this period are relatively rare in the Jornada Mogollon area
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:217).
Between 8000 and 5000 B.C., a period of aridity resulted in widespread deflation and erosion (Monger and Buck 1995:34-36). By 7000 to 6000 B.C., summer temperatures had risen; precipitation shifted
to a dominant summer monsoonal pattern, while the frequency of severe winter freezes increased (DickPeddie et al. 1993:16; Monger 1993:91; Van Devender 1990:126; Van Devender and Riskind 1979:138).
These changes in climate and vegetation apparently precipitated the demise of Bison antiquus and other
large game animals, necessitating a shift to a broader subsistence base (Miller 2006:16; Van Devender
1977:192). The drying trend also may have caused humans to congregate near playas, streams, and other
permanent and ephemeral water sources (Carmichael 1986:8; Miller 2006:16).
Late Paleoindian sites have been found in a variety of topographic settings including alluvial fans,
but most are near playas, in basins, or along the Rio Grande valley margin (Miller 2006:16; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:217). One of the most extensive sites is LA63880, a processing locale that contained
over 100 transverse end scrapers and 2 projectile point fragments with parallel flaking and/or diamondshaped cross sections (Elyea 1988:235-237). The site is in the southern Tularosa Basin, located 1.2 miles
from a playa. At another late Paleoindian site complex near Orogrande, New Mexico, Plainview and Folsom points were found around Moody Tank, a dry Pleistocene lakebed located approximately 33 miles
north of Hueco Tanks (Russell 1968).
Archaic
The Archaic period is 6,200 years long, extending from 6000 B.C. to A.D. 200 (Miller 2007:3-1). Its onset
is marked by broad-scale change to a more diverse subsistence based on large and small animals, and greater
use of seasonally available plants (Beckett 1979:224-225; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:218). Archaic components contain dart points with stem widths greater than 8 mm (Roney 1985a:105, 151); their styles are used
to divide the Archaic into early, middle, and late periods (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:232). A sequence of
Archaic phases and associated dart point types has been proposed by MacNeish and Beckett (MacNeish and
Beckett 1987, MacNeish 1993), but has not been confirmed to date (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:218).
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic period is 2,000 to 3,000 years long, extending from 6000 to 4000/3000 B.C. (Miller
2007:3-1). Defined primarily on the basis of dart point styles, the period is not well understood because

29

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

few firmly dated Early Archaic components have been identified in the region (Miller 2006:17). Their
low visibility may be due to the likelihood that many Early Archaic components are buried in Q3 sediments on alluvial fans (see Environmental Background), or in rockshelters (Hall 2007:9-13; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:220-221).
Early Archaic projectile point technology represents a change from lanceolate Paleoindian forms to
strong-stemmed dart point types like Jay, Bajada, and Uvalde, and other, split-stemmed forms (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004:221, 232). There is some indication during this period of a shift from using finegrained to coarse-grained stone for making dart points (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:221-223).
Use of rock or caliche to retain heat in hearths becomes apparent during the Early Archaic period,
and possibly reflects an increased emphasis on plant processing (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:221).
Ground stone tool use also is evident at sites like Gardner Springs in south-central New Mexico, where
a metate was found near a hearth dating between 5570 and 5070 B.C. (Beckett 1973:45; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:220), and 41HZ402 near the southeast end of the Hueco Bolson, where metate fragments were associated with a rock hearth dating between 5980 and 5650 B.C. (OâLaughlin and Martin
1992:26-27, 62).
The onset of the Early Archaic period coincides generally with the establishment of grassland communities in the southwestern United States around 5500 B.C. (Van Devender and Spaulding 1979:707),
although some grass species had appeared much earlier (Hall and Riskind 2010:727-728; Monger and
Buck 1995:60). The scarcity of substantial Early Archaic occupational deposits in the Jornada Mogollon
area may indicate that small bands employed a seasonally mobile hunting and gathering strategy across
an increasingly diverse environmental landscape (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:222-223). Early Archaic
hearth features are not common but have been found in all environmental zones; larger rock hearths on
alluvial fans may indicate a greater intensity of plant processing in those areas (Miller 2007:3-2).
Middle Archaic
The Middle Archaic period is 1,800 to 2,800 years long, extending from 4000/3000 to 1200 B.C.
(Miller 2007:3-1). The drying trend that had begun in the Early Archaic continued during this period.
As the distribution of plants and animals became more restricted and their timing more variable, a
land use pattern may have been adopted that focused on seasonally available food resources. While the
increased number of sites and features dating to the Middle Archaic could result from such a pattern, it
also may indicate a population increase (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:223).
Dart points dating to the Middle Archaic are distinguished by (1) contracting stems and flat,
rounded, or pointed bases, or (2) expanding stems and concave bases (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:225,
232; Roney 1985b:22). Blade beveling or serration typically is present on over one-third of the dart
points, which may have served as multi-function tools (Miller 2006:26). Most Middle Archaic points
are chert, but some contracting stemmed forms were made of obsidian from Chihuahua (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:234; Miller 2006:27). This indicates the extent of the territorial range of Middle Archaic
populations, and/or their exchange relationships (Miller 2002a, 2006:27).
Most known Middle Archaic sites are temporary camps, but evidence of semisedentary settlement was found in the foothills of the Franklin Mountains at Keystone Dam site 33 (41EP495; Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004:224; OâLaughlin 1980:135-149), located ca. 28 miles west-southwest of Hueco
Tanks. Excavations found 23 shallow, 3 m diameter basins representing brush structures or huts with
superstructures of branches, leaves, and grass plastered with clay, dating between 2500 and 1800 B.C.
30

Prehistoric Background

(OâLaughlin 1980:135-149). The simple construction of these huts and scarcity of associated features
suggest that they were occupied on a short-term basis (Binford 1990:120; Carmichael 1985a:175-181;
Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:224). Middle Archaic huts have been identified elsewhere in the Jornada
Mogollon area (e.g., Camilli et al. 1988; Miller et al. 1993), including a possible small hut dating between
2860 and 2360 B.C. at El Arenal (41EP3175), located 8.5 miles west-southwest of Hueco Tanks (Miller
2007:8-30 through 8-36). Such structures probably were more widespread than the current small sample indicates (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:224).
Middle Archaic campsites appear to have been positioned for access to a variety, and perhaps an
abundance, of food sources (OâLaughlin 1980:29). The rock hearths and ground stone tools that date
to this period suggest a focus on plant foods in addition to hunting (Miller 2007:3-3). One example is a
small basin-shaped pit packed with fire cracked rocks at Keystone Dam Site 32 (41EP325) that dates to
ca. 2160 B.C., in a component with relatively abundant ground stone tools (Fields and Girard 1983:9899, 192-198). Direct information on Middle Archaic subsistence is limited, but includes rabbit bones
and eggshells from Zone 4 of Keystone Dam site 33 (OâLaughlin 1980:94-95).
Most of the sites and features in the region that have been dated to the Middle Archaic via radiocarbon assay are located in the central Hueco Bolson and other basins (e.g., Mauldin et al. 1998; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:223). Middle Archaic sites also tend to be located near permanent and semi-permanent
water sources like drainages and playas (Lowry et al. 2003:7-8; Miller 2006:18), and generally are larger
and have more features than Early Archaic sites (Miller 2007:3-2 through 3-3). On some sites, clusters of
features dating to the Middle Archaic may indicate the presence of larger social groups (Miller 2006:18;
Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:224). Rockshelters may not have seen intensive use during this period as
very few Middle Archaic dates have been obtained from them, though this could be due to sample bias
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:223).
Late Archaic
The Late Archaic period is 1,400 years long, extending from 1200 B.C. to A.D. 200 (Miller 2007:3-1).
Transitions in settlement patterns, subsistence, and technology were initiated during this period, foreshadowing the Formative period (Miller 2007:3-3; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:225-226). The modern
climatic regime had been established by around 2,000 B.C., with fewer winter freezes and adequate summer rainfall, punctuated by more frequent droughts (Van Devender 1990:126). An interval between 600
B.C. and A.D. 300 may have been slightly cooler with higher effective moisture (Mauldin 1995:164-165;
cf. Van Devender 1990:117-118).
Late Archaic subsistence was centered on hunting and gathering, augmented by early attempts at
plant cultivation, evidenced primarily in rockshelter sites (Doleman 2005:115-116; Miller 2007:3-3).
In the Jornada Mogollon area, cultivated plants appeared around the beginning of the Late Archaic
period, although earlier dates have been obtained from a few composite samples (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:226-227; cf. Upham et al. 1987:412). The earliest firmly-dated corn (Zea mays) has been found in
rockshelters in south-central New Mexico, dating between 1369 and 941 B.C. in Fresnal Shelter (LA10101;
Tagg 1996:317) and between 1210 and 970 B.C. in High Rolls Cave (LA114103; Lentz 2006:215). Other
cultivated plants were adopted somewhat later, including tobacco (Nicotiana rustica type; 1200 to 940
B.C.) and amaranth (Amaranthus cruentus type; 1110 to 900 B.C.) found in High Rolls Cave (Lentz
2006:204, 209, 217). Cultivation of beans (Phaseolus sp.) may have followed by several centuries, based
on the earliest date of 349 B.C. to A.D. 57 at Fresnal Shelter (Bohrer 2007:149; Tagg 1996:317).

31

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Although cultivated plants constituted a relatively reliable food source, they comprised a very small
part of the diverse Late Archaic diet (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:227-228). The high density of edible
shrubs, succulents, and forbs in the Jornada Mogollon area, and the limited habitats for productive
farming, may have delayed a reliance on cultivated plants in comparison to adjoining regions (Hard and
Roney 2005:172). An increase in bulk processing of leaf succulents like lechuguilla and sotol near the
end of the Late Archaic period is evidenced by large, rock-filled pit ovens on alluvial fan sites like Keystone Dam site 33 (Miller 2007:11-59; OâLaughlin 1980:106-107). The meat diet in areas near mountains consisted primarily of large mammals like mule deer, as evidenced by samples from Fresnal and
other rockshelters (Miller 2007:12-6; Wimberley and Eidenbach 1981:23). Logistical hunting of deer
and other medium-sized animals appears to be represented by the chipped stone tools at El Arenal
(Miller 2007:11-64), but faunal remains from most Late Archaic open-air sites consist primarily of rabbit bones (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:228).
Late Archaic dart points are corner- and side-notched forms with convex or flat bases, and became
significantly smaller in the latter half of the period, foreshadowing introduction of the bow and arrow
(Miller 2007:3-3; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:226, 229; Roney 1985b:22). Blade modification declined
relative to the Middle Archaic, possibly indicating the reduced versatility and/or durability of projectile
points (Miller 2007:3-4; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:232-234). An increase in use of local coarse-grained
stone appears to be related to production of tools for plant processing and hut construction (Miller
2007:11-59). Ground stone tools were used predominantly for wild plant processing, if the specimens
from El Arenal are typical (Miller 2007:12-11 through 12-12). Cruciforms were made by grinding and
polishing obsidian and (rarely) other materials to form small cross-shaped, square or rectangular pieces,
the function of which is not certain (Ferg 1998:562-565). A variety of artifacts made of plant materials
are evident in Late Archaic rockshelter deposits at sites like West Cave (EPCM 31:106:4:114, FB6672),
located ca. 3 miles west of Hueco Tanks in a Hueco Mountain outlier, where a corner-notched dart
point was recovered from a level that also yielded cordage, part of a wickerwork sandal, and basketry
(OâLaughlin 1977:173-176).
Although most Late Archaic sites appear to have been occupied briefly, an intensive occupation was
found on the basin margin at El Arenal, located 8.5 miles west-southwest of Hueco Tanks (Miller 2007).
Situated between a playa and the distal Hueco Mountain alluvial fan, the Late Archaic component of this
site included five shallow basins ranging from 1.8 to 3.1 m in diameter and 20 to 32 cm deep, representing small huts with superstructures made of posts, possibly covered with brush and/or hides. Fifty-nine
associated hearths or hearth clean-out features consisted primarily of ash stains, with only 10 containing
rocks (Miller 2007:8-36 through 8-37). The presence of an incipient midden and refuse disposal area
indicates that the occupation was longer-term and more residential than at other sites of this period,
possibly due to the proximity of a playa that provided a relatively reliable water source (Miller 2007:1030, 12-22).
The Late Archaic period saw a dramatic increase in numbers of archeological sites and features; use
of basin areas reached a peak, although sites were located in all environmental zones (Miller 2007:34; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:230-232). Most rockshelters that were inhabited have considerable Late
Archaic deposits (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:226). Population density apparently increased (Whalen
1994b:625). In conjunction with greater use of local raw materials for tool stone, these increases indicate
more intensive land use and related decreases in group mobility, or perhaps territorial ranges (Miller
2007:3-2, 3-4; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:235). Cultivation of plants on even a minor scale decreased
mobility, necessitating occupation of places that offered access to both agriculturally productive land
and favored foraging areas (Doleman 2005:118; Mauldin 1995:114).

Prehistoric Background

Formative
The beginning of the Formative period is marked by the appearance of El Paso brownware ceramics
around A.D. 200, and the period ends around 1450 when pueblo settlements were abandoned (Miller
2005b:68, 2007:3-1; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:258). Lehmer (1948:70-89) divided the southern Jornada Mogollon Formative period into the Mesilla, DoÃ±a Ana, and El Paso phases, based primarily on
differences in ceramics and architecture; the El Paso phase already had been defined by Sayles (1935:7279). This terminology is still in use, but Lehmerâs (1948:87-88) date ranges have been refined through
extensive chronometric analyses (Katz 1992; Miller 1996b-f, 2005b; Whalen 1985a, b).
A rapid succession of changes in settlement, subsistence, and architecture occurred during the 1,250
year Formative period (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:236). At the outset, Mesilla phase occupations were
widely distributed across the interior basin, while subsequent DoÃ±a Ana and El Paso phase settlements
were concentrated in core areas on the distal alluvial fans of mountain ranges, often adjacent to playas (Carmichael 1986:227-229; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:244-245; Whalen 1977:140, 1978:33-34).
Subsistence initially focused on hunting and gathering but gradually shifted to increasing use of corn
and finally, a specialized agricultural adaptation (Hard, Mauldin, and Raymond 1996:297-298; Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004:244). Transition to an economy including corn as a staple element did not occur
until ca. A.D. 1100, much later than in other regions of the Southwest (Hard, Mauldin, and Raymond
1996:298). These changes generally coincided with decreasing mobility (Miller 2007:3-4; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:238). Although structures became increasingly formal during the Formative period,
several types were in use during each phase, representing different levels of mobility and labor investment (Binford 1990:124-127; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:241).
Mesilla Phase
The Mesilla phase (Lehmer 1948:75-78) opens the Formative period and is 800 years long, extending from A.D. 200 to 1000 (Miller 2007:3-1). It is the longest Formative phase, and is divided into
early and late intervals at A.D. 650 based on changes in settlement patterns and demography; the latter
interval saw decreased use of the central basin, intensified land use, and a greater degree of residential
stability (Mauldin 1995:277-278; Mauldin et al. 1998:158; Miller 2005b:74; Whalen 1994b:625). Mesilla
phase sites are more numerous, tend to be larger, and typically contain more artifacts than Archaic sites
(Miller 2007:3-5).
The climate during the Mesilla phase was effectively modern, but a relatively cool and moist interval
occurred between A.D. 400 and 700, based on decreased variation in tree ring widths in southwestern
New Mexico. Tree ring data from southern New Mexico indicate a warm-dry climate from A.D. 700
to 1040, culminating in a severe drought between A.D. 940 and 1040 (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997:52;
Mauldin 1995:159-166).
The El Paso brownware ceramic tradition began around A.D. 200 with the introduction of undecorated El Paso Brown ceramics, made locally with a distinctive temper of coarse-grained, crushed granite
or syenite (Miller 1995:211-212). Mesilla phase brownware pots were designed primarily to be strong
and portable while having moderate resistance to breakage from heating, based on the small size, low
abundance, and low angularity of macroscopically visible temper (Miller and Burt 2007:5-10). Source
analyses indicate that El Paso Brown ceramics were widely transported and traded during this phase
(Miller and Burt 2007:5-11 through 5-16). Late in the Mesilla phase between A.D. 800 and 1000, black
33

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

or red paint was applied to the brownware, creating El Paso Bichrome pottery (Miller 1995:212-214,
2007:3-5).
Nonlocal Mimbres Black-on-white ceramics were traded into the Hueco Bolson during the late
Mesilla phase from production areas in southwestern New Mexico (Miller 1995:216). Several Mimbres
decorative styles have been identified, three of which date to this phase: Style I was made between A.D.
750 and 900, Style II from A.D. 880 to 1020, and Style II/III from A.D. 970 to 1020 (Anyon et al. 1981;
Scott 1983:41, 45; Shafer and Brewington 1995:7). Source analyses indicate that these ceramics were
manufactured primarily in the Mimbres heartland and areas to the north; the small quantities found on
Mesilla phase sites in the Hueco Bolson suggest that contacts with the Mimbres area were sporadic and
of relatively low intensity (Miller and Burt 2007:6-2 through 6-7).
Nonlocal marine shells, minerals, and turquoise first appear in the region on Mesilla phase sites, but
are rare, indicating that the Jornada Mogollon area was involved in pan-Southwestern exchange networks
but was not a primary participant (Miller 2007:4-13 through 4-14; Miller and Burt 2007:9-8). The shells
come from the Gulf of California and/or the Pacific coast, and the ornament styles are similar to items
manufactured at Casas Grandes (Bradley 1999:225; Southward 1979:102). Turquoise is available from
source areas across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico (Mathien 2001:104), but the
nearest source to the Hueco Bolson is the Jarilla Mountains (Schmidt and Craddock 1964:44), located 37
miles north of Hueco Tanks.
Projectile points are relatively rare on most Formative period sites (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:255). During the Mesilla phase, corner- and side-notched dart point forms typical of the Late
Archaic period persisted in use, while their overall size continued to diminish (Miller 2007:3-4;
Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:229). Arrow points were introduced near the end of the Mesilla phase, as
indicated by at least one small point dating to around A.D. 850 at the Turquoise Ridge site (41EP762),
6.5 miles west-northwest of Hueco Tanks (Whalen 1994a:109). Ninety miles to the east in the Guadalupe Mountains, arrow points came into use around A.D. 875 (Roney 1985b:29). The proportion of Chihuahuan obsidian in Mesilla phase chipped stone assemblages declined, representing
shrinking territorial ranges and diminishing relations with Mexico (Miller 2002a, 2005a; Miller and
Shackley 1998).
Subsistence during the Mesilla phase was based primarily on wild plant foods, supplemented by
small amounts of cultivated plants (Miller and Burt 2007:2-2; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:237). Broadscale gathering of an array of wild plants shifted by the end of the phase to intensive procurement and
bulk processing of leaf succulents like agave and sotol (Miller 2007:11-40). Processing sites were concentrated on upper alluvial fans (OâLaughlin 1979:72; 1980:107), with features like a ring midden that
dates between A.D. 670 and 1230 at the Pow Wow Site (41EP32), located 4.5 miles south of Hueco Tanks
(Greer 1968:126; Miller 1996f).
Remains of cultivated corn and beans have been found on a few Mesilla phase sites (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:248), and use of corn apparently increased during the late Mesilla phase at Turquoise
Ridge and other sites dating to this period (Whalen 1994a:119; 1994b:634). Greater numbers of ground
stone tools on sites represent a rise in processing of both wild and cultivated plants (Miller 2007:3-5).
Curation of seeds may be related to the adoption of ceramics in the Mesilla phase, as vessels similar to
the earliest brownware forms are commonly interpreted as seed containers (Miller 2007:12-23 through
12-24; Miller and Burt 2007:9-6). The wild and cultivated plant diet was supplemented by meat from
rabbits and other small game, while hunting of deer and other artiodactyls apparently declined (Miller
2007:3-6, 12-7). Jackrabbits and cottontails comprise the vast majority of identifiable animal bones on
most Mesilla phase sites, including Turquoise Ridge (Whalen 1994a:120-125).

34

Prehistoric Background

Construction and use of informal hearths peaked during the late Mesilla phase between A.D. 650
and 1000, as the size of hearths increased (Miller 2005b:72; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:250-251). This
shift is illustrated at Turquoise Ridge, where both small pits dating to the early Mesilla phase and large
baking ovens dating to the late Mesilla phase are thought to have been used to roast succulent plants
(Whalen 1994a:63). The function of these features is evident at Keystone Dam sites 33 and 34 (41EP495
and 41EP496), where small and large rock features dating to the Mesilla phase were located near concentrations of agave and sotol, and yielded charred leaf succulent remains (OâLaughlin 1980:85, 108, 229).
Charred succulent leaves also were recovered from two large roasting pits dating to the late Mesilla phase
at Castner Range Site 80/81 (41EP2877) on the Franklin Mountain alluvial fan (Hard 1983b:23-29).
Two house types were in common use throughout the Mesilla phase: shallow, circular huts similar
to those built during the Archaic period, and square to subrectangular pithouses (Hard 1983b:42-44;
Lehmer 1960:127; Miller 2005b:69; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:241). The huts may have been summer
abodes and the pithouses winter residences (Hard 1983a:48; Miller 2007:3-5). The structures at Turquoise Ridge are large versions of typical Mesilla phase huts, built over basins measuring 3.1 to 4.8 m
in diameter and 20 to 40 cm deep, with short entry ramps. Their walls were made of small posts that
probably were tied together to create sloping roofs (Whalen 1994a:46-51). There is no evidence of mud
plaster like that used on some Middle Archaic huts (i.e., OâLaughlin 1980:144). Representing minimal
effort to construct, this type of structure probably was occupied for short periods of time (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:239; Whalen 1994a:65-66). Circular huts fell out of use at the end of the Mesilla phase
(Miller 2005b:69).
Both pithouses and huts were found at Los Tules, the Mesilla phase type site located on the Rio
Grande north of Las Cruces (Lehmer 1948:13-35). Four pithouses were evidenced by square depressions measuring from 3.0 to 3.5 m on a side and 20 to 85 cm deep, with short entry ramps (Hard
1983b:42). Wall and floor surfaces generally were not plastered, and no evidence was found of mud
plaster from superstructures. Two pithouses had clay-lined hearths and the other two had ash concentrations, all located near the entry ramps. Roofs were supported by 3 posts along each side wall, and
presumably consisted of wooden frameworks covered with grass thatch (Lehmer 1948:24). Pithouse
construction required a substantial expenditure of labor, and these structures probably were occupied
for several months during the winter, when they would have provided protection from the weather (Gilman 1987:543; Hard 1983a:46, 48).
Communal rooms may be represented by larger structures at several sites. A hut at Turquoise Ridge
was built over a basin measuring 6 m in diameter and 75 cm deep, with remnants of a bench around
its perimeter (Whalen 1994a:51-53). The room yielded most of the unmodified and shaped turquoise
found at the site, along with ornaments made from marine shell (Whalen 1994a:127-128). At Los Tules,
one of the pithouses that was deeper than the others also had a perimeter bench; turquoise and shell
ornaments were recovered from the site (Lehmer 1948:23-24, 29-30), but their context is not reported.
Early Mesilla phase settlements were dispersed across all topographic zones (Miller and Burt
2007:2-2), and the central basin and alluvial fans were components of a residential foraging strategy.
Foothill settings like Hueco Tanks apparently were used seasonally when water was abundant (Carmichael 1990:126-127; Hard 1983a; OâLaughlin 1979:5). In response to increasing population density,
groups began to aggregate into small settlements composed of two to three household clusters (Miller
and Burt 2007:9-6).
A major shift in settlement strategy occurred in the late Mesilla phase, beginning around A.D. 650
(Miller 2005b:74). There is evidence for an increased degree of sedentism, more dependence on agriculture, and greater population density (Hard 1983a:41; Miller 2007:3-5; OâLaughlin 1980:25-26; Whalen

35

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

1994b:627-628). Use of features in the central basin peaked around A.D. 650 and then declined, while
use of features on alluvial fans increased (Mauldin 1994:186, 1995:218-219, 276; Mauldin et al. 1998:147,
158; Miller 2006:24). The distribution and seasonality of resources suggest to Hard (1983a:44-47) that
late Mesilla phase groups planted agricultural fields on the alluvial fans or river terraces in the late spring
and early summer, to take advantage of the runoff from midsummer rains. During the summer and
fall they probably occupied multiple short-term camps in the central basin while harvesting seeds from
flowering plants, legumes, grasses, and cacti, relying on water from temporary ponds. Groups may have
returned to the alluvial fans or river terraces in the fall to harvest the agricultural fields. In the winter
and spring, camps would have been positioned on alluvial fans and other locations in proximity to reliable water sources, and probably were occupied for relatively long spans of time, supported by stored
plant foods.
DoÃ±a Ana Phase
The DoÃ±a Ana phase is 300 years long, extending from A.D. 1000 to 1300 (Miller 2005b:74; 2007:31). The phase originally was conceived to encompass the transition from pithouse to pueblo occupations (Lehmer 1948:78-80), but there was subsequent disagreement on whether sites dating to the DoÃ±a
Ana phase could be distinguished from those dating to the preceding Mesilla or following El Paso phases
(Mauldin et al. 1998:16; Miller 1989:20-21; Shafer et al. 1999:20-22). Recognition of DoÃ±a Ana components based on survey-level ceramic data has been problematic (Hard et al. 1994:278), but excavations
have confidently identified a limited number of DoÃ±a Ana occupations tethered by radiocarbon assays
to this relatively short period. The phase is divided into early and late intervals at A.D. 1150 based on
differences in settlement pattern, subsistence, technology, and social organization (Miller 2005b:73-74).
Climatic conditions fluctuated considerably during the DoÃ±a Ana phase, based on tree ring data from
southern and southwestern New Mexico. On the heels of the warm-dry late Mesilla phase, the climate
became relatively cool and moist between A.D. 1040 and 1210 (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997:52; Mauldin
1995:159-166). That interval was followed by a period of below-average rainfall from A.D. 1210 to 1305,
culminating in a severe drought between A.D. 1272 and 1296 (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997:49, 52, 60).
Ceramic assemblages dating to the DoÃ±a Ana phase continued to be dominated by locally made
brownware (Hard et al. 1994:278). The proportion of decorated brownware increased gradually between
A.D. 1000 and 1275, and polychrome vessels completely replaced the earlier styles by the end of the
DoÃ±a Ana phase (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:252; Whalen 1981a:220). Production of El Paso Brown
(undecorated) and El Paso Bichrome (red or black painted) ceramics ended around A.D. 1000/1100
and A.D. 1100/1250, respectively (Miller 1995:212-214). El Paso Polychrome (red and black painted)
ceramics were introduced around A.D. 1000/1100; early vessels are designated as the Transitional variant and were decorated with chevrons, triangles, broad parallel lines pendant from rim bands, and rare
stepped frets (Miller 1989:186-190; 1995:212, 214). Around A.D. 1250 this variant was supplanted by
the Classic variant, consisting of vessels with everted rims and thickened lips decorated with elaborate
red and black parallel or interlocking bands, stepped frets, and curvilinear designs that covered most of
the upper vessel wall (Miller 1995:214-216; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:253; Whalen 1981a:226). Vessel
forms also evolved; the quantity of neckless jars declined while the proportion of jars with necks and
everted rims increased, vessel sizes expanded, and vessel walls became thinner (Miller 1989:186; 2007:39; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:253; Whalen 1981a:223-226).
Nonlocal pottery comprised a small but consistent percentage of DoÃ±a Ana phase assemblages,
indicating contacts primarily with areas to the north. Trade in Mimbres Black-on-white ceramics from
36

Prehistoric Background

southwestern New Mexico continued during the early DoÃ±a Ana phase: Styles II and II/III were made until
A.D. 1020, and Style III was produced between A.D. 1010 and 1130 (Anyon et al. 1981; Miller 1995:216;
Scott 1983:41, 45; Shafer and Brewington 1995:7). Source analyses indicate that more production locales
are represented in Mimbres ceramics after A.D. 1000; contacts with the Mimbres region apparently
became more frequent and/or had greater intensity (Miller and Burt 2007:6-6 through 6-7).
In the late DoÃ±a Ana phase, ceramics manufactured in other regions to the north appeared in the
Hueco Bolson, including Chupadero Black-on-white; production of this ware began between A.D. 1050
and 1150 (Clark 2006:67-68; Miller 1995:216; Wiseman 1986:4). Source analyses indicate that most of
the Chupadero pottery that came to the El Paso area was made in the Sierra Blanca/Capitan Mountain
area of south-central New Mexico (Clark 2006:188-191; Creel, Clark, and Neff 2002:126-127). Three
Rivers Red-on-terracotta also originated in the Sierra Blanca area, and was produced from A.D. 1150
into the early 1300s (Breternitz 1966:97; Lehmer 1948:86; Miller and Graves 2009:255; Runyan and
Hedrick 1973:29; Stewart 1983:45). St. Johns ware (including Black-on-red and Polychrome varieties)
was made in west-central New Mexico, and spanned a period from A.D. 1175 to 1300 (Carlson 1970:31,
37-39).
Beginning in the late DoÃ±a Ana phase, other nonlocal ceramics enter the region; originating in
Chihuahua, they also were made in locales closer to the Hueco Bolson. Playas Red is associated with
the Buena Fe through Robles phases at Casas Grandes (Rinaldo 1974:148), spanning a period from
A.D. 1200 through the early 1500s (Dean and Ravesloot 1993:97-98). Clay source and temper analyses indicate that Playas also was manufactured in southern New Mexico and the Hueco Bolson (Creel
1999:115-116; Creel, Williams, Neff, and Glascock 2002:43; Shafer et al. 2001:343, 351; Wiseman 1981).
Ramos Polychrome is associated with the Buena Fe through Diablo phases at Casas Grandes (Rinaldo
and Fenner 1974:251), spanning a period from A.D. 1200 to 1500 (Dean and Ravesloot 1993:97-98;
Miller 1995:216). Casas Grandes remains the most likely source for this type (Di Peso et al. 1974b:251),
but secondary production occurred in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico (Fish and
Fish 1999:39; Skibo et al. 2002:39-41).
Projectile points typically comprise a very low percentage of chipped stone assemblages dating to the
DoÃ±a Ana phase (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:255). Arrow points dominate the small projectile samples
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:233), but dart points persisted in use (Newton and Upham 1988:104), probably scavenged from earlier occupations (Miller 1996e:73). Production of arrow points was associated
with greater use of obsidian, obtained primarily from local gravels (Miller 2007:11-61, 11-64; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:233-234). Other chipped stone tools were increasingly made of coarse-grained local
raw materials, and were suitable for tasks like harvesting and processing plant foods in bulk, preparing
wood and fiber for structures, and digging clay for adobe (Miller 2007:11-59).
Changes in subsistence occurred at the beginning of the DoÃ±a Ana phase, possibly correlated to
a period of relatively cool and moist conditions beginning after A.D. 1000 (Doleman 2005:117; Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997:52; Mauldin 1995:159-166). Agricultural dependence increased between A.D.
1000 and 1300 (Miller 2005b:71; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:249). The Gobernadora and Ojasen sites
are representative of early DoÃ±a Ana phase subsistence, yielding considerable remains of wild plants
like agave and sotol, and only minor amounts of corn (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:248; Shafer et al.
1999:307). Ubiquity values for corn and beans increased significantly after A.D. 1150, and late DoÃ±a Ana
phase components at sites like Meyer Pithouse Village produced moderate quantities of corn, beans,
and gourds (Miller 2005b:72; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:248; 2001:265-269). Increased corn processing
also is evidenced by significantly greater mano lengths and metate grinding areas (Hard, Mauldin, and
Raymond 1996:280, 298; Miller 2007:3-6; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:252).

37

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Concurrent with increased agricultural dependence was intensified exploitation of succulents and
other wild plants (Hard, Mauldin, and Raymond 1996:298; Miller 2005b:71; Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:249). Succulent plant remains reached a peak of 40 percent ubiquity in samples dating between A.D.
1150 and 1275/1300 (Miller 2005b:72). Rock features reflected the dramatic increase in bulk plant processing; construction and use of rock-lined pits increased slightly after A.D. 1000 and had a pronounced
peak between A.D. 1150 and 1300. Conversely, use of small and medium-sized informal hearths declined
slightly after A.D. 1000 and then abruptly after A.D. 1300 (Miller 2005b:72; 2007:3-9, 11-40, 11-60).
Hunting generally decreased in importance during the DoÃ±a Ana phase, based on a steep drop
in the number of projectile points relative to radiocarbon assays in the region (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:232). Jackrabbits and cottontails comprised the vast majority of animals hunted at the Gobernadora and Meyer Pithouse Village sites; the former could have been obtained by means of communal
drives (Miller 1989:293-297; Peterson 2001:243). Deer and pronghorn were represented in very low
numbers at these sites (Shafer et al. 1999:296-297; Peterson 2001:243).
Two types of structures were occupied during the DoÃ±a Ana phase: subrectangular pithouses and
one-room adobe structures (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:239-241; cf. Lehmer 1948:78-80). The average depth of the floors of these structures was greater than in any other Formative phase (Graves et al.
2001:149). The similar size of DoÃ±a Ana villages suggests that they were occupied by lineage groups
consisting of one or more extended families (Shafer et al. 1999:315).
Subrectangular pithouses typical of the DoÃ±a Ana phase were found on the west edge of the Hueco
Bolson at the Gobernadora site (41EP321; Miller 1989, Shafer et al. 1999). Dating to the early part of
the phase (A.D. 1050 to 1150), they were built over basins ranging from 2.2 to 4.8 m on a side and 25
to 70 cm deep, and had internal hearths and short entry ramps (Miller 1989:68-81, 195; Shafer et al.
1999:78-90). Roof beams were made of wood and supported by a few irregularly spaced posts, some of
which were agave flower stalks (Shafer et al. 1999:80, 82, 98, 139-140). This type of structure probably
represents a fairly short-term occupation because it required little effort to construct. The Gobernadora
pithouses were reoccupied periodically, perhaps seasonally; refitting of ceramics from diverse contexts
indicates that when the structures were refurbished, refuse was displaced and redeposited into other
abandoned structures (Miller 1989:85, 194).
One-room adobe structures also have been found on DoÃ±a Ana phase sites; requiring a greater level
of effort to construct and maintain, they probably represent longer occupations (Miller 2005b:68; Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004:239; Scarborough 1989:422). This type of structure was found at Meyer Pithouse
Village (LA97128; Scarborough 1989), located 7 miles northwest of Hueco Tanks. Dating primarily to
the early DoÃ±a Ana phase (A.D. 1000 to 1250; Miller 2001a:157), the four structures are represented
by rectangular basins with rounded corners ranging from 2 to 5 m on a side and from 45 to 117 cm
deep, with doorways opening to the south. Their floors and lower walls were plastered with caliche, and
hearths were surrounded by adobe coping. One linear entryway had molded caliche steps. Walls extending above the basins may have been made of adobe, based on the recovery of several large chunks. Interior posts generally were positioned at basin corners or along the central axis, supporting roofs that were
plastered, based on recovery of burned clay in roof fall (Peterson 2001:39-118; Scarborough 1989:412).
Single, notably larger structures at Meyer Pithouse Village (Scarborough 1989:423) and other DoÃ±a
Ana sites apparently served as communal rooms (Miller 1989:17; 2007:3-6). The largest structure at
Meyer Pithouse Village contained numerous pits and postholes, a human burial, and more turquoise
and obsidian than any other structure at the site (Peterson 2001:42, 86-89; Scarborough 1989:414). By
the onset of the late DoÃ±a Ana phase the number of freestanding one-room adobe structures in the
Jornada Mogollon area had doubled, while construction and use of subrectangular pithouses declined
and essentially ended by A.D. 1300 (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:240).
38

Prehistoric Background

Major changes in regional settlement patterns occurred during the DoÃ±a Ana phase. Use of the
central basin declined markedly (Mauldin 1995:218), while occupation of alluvial fans and runoff zones
increased (Miller 2005b:69, 2007:3-8). Around A.D. 1150, utilization of alluvial fans reached a peak and
settlements near playas became common (Miller 2005b:69; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:246). These locations probably were preferred due to the proximity of arable soils and reliable water sources (Beckes et
al. 1977:73; Carmichael 1990:129-130; Miller 2007:3-6). Terraces along the Rio Grande offered similar
resources but were subject to flooding (Hard and Roney 2005:171). Increasing population density may
have instigated this settlement shift (Whalen 1977:137, 1981b:82).
El Paso Phase
With a length of only 150 years, El Paso is the shortest Formative phase, extending from A.D. 1300
to 1450 (Miller 2005b:67, 74). It was identified initially on sites with adobe-walled linear room blocks, El
Paso Polychrome ceramics, and stone, shell, and turquoise ornaments (Sayles 1935:72, Table 7). Lehmer
(1948:80-84) broadened the phase definition to include room blocks arrayed around plazas, and provided greater detail on the associated artifact assemblages. Representing the peak of Native American
cultural development in the Jornada Mogollon area, the El Paso phase saw the highest level of permanent settlement in pueblos, maximum concentration of populations near areas suitable for agriculture,
and greatest degree of interregional interaction and religious expression (Lehmer 1948:80-82; Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004:238).
These developments were facilitated by a period of reduced climatic variability that began after
A.D. 1300, based on tree ring data from southern New Mexico (Grissino-Mayer et al. 1997:54). Precipitation increased considerably, and was abundant between 1355 and 1400 (Grissino-Mayer et al.
1997:62). Severe but short-term droughts from A.D. 1405 to 1410 and 1445 to 1450 (Grissino-Mayer et
al. 1997:63) may have ushered in the end of the intensive El Paso phase lifestyle.
Ceramic assemblages dating to this phase are dominated by El Paso Polychrome. The Classic variant
of this type was made between A.D. 1250 and 1450; vessels with everted rims and thickened lips were
decorated with distinctive designs including alternating red and black parallel bands, opposed black
stepped frets bracketing red fields, and black squares filled with red (Miller 1995:212-216). El Paso Polychrome Classic necked jar forms predominated, while neckless brownware jars essentially disappeared
(Lehmer 1948:80; Miller 2007:3-9).
Nonlocal pottery is present on El Paso phase sites in minor amounts. Almost all of it is Chupadero
Black-on-white, a long-lived type that was produced throughout the El Paso phase (Miller 1995:216).
The Chupadero pottery on sites in the Hueco Bolson was made in the Sierra Blanca/Capitan Mountain
area of south-central New Mexico, based on source analyses (Clark 2006:188-191; Creel, Clark, and Neff
2002:126-127). Most of the imported Chupadero vessels were small-necked jars with handles, suitable
for water storage and transport (Creel, Clark, and Neff 2002:111; Smiley 1979:58-60).
Trace amounts of other nonlocal ceramics on El Paso phase sites could come from Chihuahua, but
also were produced in and near the Hueco Bolson. Playas Red dates from A.D. 1200 to the early 1500s
(Dean and Ravesloot 1993:97-98; Rinaldo 1974:148) and was primarily associated with Casas Grandes,
but also was made of clay from southwestern New Mexico and the Hueco Bolson (Creel 1999:115-116;
Creel, Williams, Neff, and Glascock 2002:43; Shafer et al. 2001:343, 351). Ramos Polychrome dates from
A.D. 1200 to 1500 (Dean and Ravesloot 1993:97-98; Miller 1995:216; Rinaldo and Fenner 1974:251);
Casas Grandes is its most likely manufacturing locale (Di Peso et al. 1974b:251), but secondary produc-

tion occurred in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico (Fish and Fish 1999:39; Skibo et
al. 2002:39-41).
Ornaments and other non-utilitarian artifacts are relatively abundant on El Paso phase sites,
including shell jewelry, turquoise, other shaped stones, and (rarely) copper bells. Apparent dedicatory offerings of these items were placed on floors, in pits, and in postholes in rooms at Hot Well and
Madera Quemada pueblos (Bentley 1993:28; Miller and Graves 2009:385-392), near Sabina Mountain
(Hill 1971:92), and in other locations (Brook 1976:26-27; Phelps 1967:24-25). Some of these items
were imported from outside the Hueco Bolson and others were obtained from local sources; altogether, they may indicate the development of a religious complex (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:238).
Many of the shell artifacts were imported. Most are beads, pendants, or bracelets made from Olivella, Glycymeris, and other marine shells, although some were fashioned from the shells of freshwater
mussels from the Rio Grande (e.g., Cosgrove 1947:Figure 147). Shell ornaments typically are scattered
across pueblo floors and other living areas, and apparently were worn by inhabitants. The marine
species are native to the Gulf of California and Pacific coast, so those shell artifacts were obtained
through trade (Lowry 2005:203; Southward 1979:102). Shell manufacturing debris is rare on Jornada
Mogollon sites (Brook 1976:27, 1980:77), another indication that most or all of the ornaments were
imported. Many worked shells are stylistically similar to items found at Casas Grandes, and possibly
were obtained from there (Bradley 1999:225-226).
Turquoise in the form of unmodified chunks, partially shaped pieces, and finished ornaments
has been found at the Hot Well and Sabina Mountain #2 pueblos (Brook 1980:70; Lowry 2005:208)
and other El Paso phase sites. Although turquoise was available from prehistoric source areas across
the southwestern United States and northern Mexico (Harbottle and Weigand 1992:84; Mathien
2001:104), the specimens in the Hueco Bolson may have been obtained from the nearby Jarilla Mountains (Beckes et al. 1977:76; Bentley 1993:8; Lowry 2005:208; Schmidt and Craddock 1964:44), where
evidence of prehistoric turquoise mining has been observed (Carmichael 1986:232).
Local stone probably was used to make other unusual artifacts found on El Paso phase sites. Fossils
include crinoid columnals (stem fragments), brachiopods (bivalves), and coral that are available from
limestone outcrops in the Hueco Mountains, including an outlier north of Sabina Mountain (Brook
1980:67, 76; Greer 1968:119; Lowry 2005:208). The fossils apparently were used as ornaments; a few
brachiopods were drilled, and the crinoid columnals have natural perforations allowing for their use
as beads. Spherical stones ranging up to 2 cm in diameter were made from local rocks by pecking and
grinding (Brook 1976:26; Lehmer 1948:82; Phelps 1967:22-23); their purpose is unknown. Small stone
palettes were used to grind pigment, based on remnants that adhere to the surface of some specimens
(e.g., Brook 1978a:12). Small, cross-shaped cruciforms made of obsidian and other local materials have
been found in El Paso phase pueblos like Hot Well and Sabina Mountain #2, apparently scavenged from
Late Archaic sites (Brook 1976:26, 1978; Carrig 2005:44; Ferg 1998:562-565; Phelps 1966).
Copper bells reportedly found near Hot Well and Sabina Mountain #2 pueblos (Brook 1976:26)
and in the southern Tularosa Basin (Crimmins 1932:34-35) likely were imported from Casas Grandes
and/or the American Southwest. Production of these artifacts was related to a metallurgy complex
that reached the west coast of Mexico around A.D. 600 and spread to Casa Grandes, where bells and
other copper items may have been produced for trade (Di Peso 1974a:511; Kelley 2000:139; cf. Vargas
1995:5-15). By A.D. 900 these distinctive items reached central Arizona (Meighan 1999:209-210),
and Gila Pueblo was a major distribution node between A.D. 1251 and 1520 (Vargas 1995:69-71).
Although elaborately fashioned copper items almost certainly were not made locally, copper ore also
is available from the Jarilla Mountains, 37 miles north of Hueco Tanks (Bentley 1993:8; Schmidt and

40

Prehistoric Background

Craddock 1964:24, 43), and small unworked ore fragments were found at the Sabina Mountain #2
pueblo (Brook 1980:70).
The quantity of nonlocal items on El Paso phase sites far exceeds previous phases, representing a high
level of participation in a regional exchange network (Hard, Patterson, and Tennis 1996:243-244; Lehmer
1948:80-82). The Jornada Mogollon area may have been on a trade route to Casas Grandes (Carmichael 1986:230; Wimberley 1979:89), or Mimbres Mogollon groups could have served as intermediaries
(Beckes et al. 1977:76). The primary product exported from the region was El Paso Polychrome pottery,
which was distributed widely (Brook 1976:29; Lehmer 1948:83). It has been found as far away as the La
Junta area on the Rio Grande to the southeast (Kenmotsu 2006:4), Casas Grandes to the south (Burgett
2007; Kelley 2000:152), Joyce Well in southwestern New Mexico (Skibo et al 2002:42-44), north to the
southern Sierra Blanca and Roswell areas (Clark 2006:294; Speth 2004), and northeast to the South Plains
(Collins 1968:100, 120; Creel, Clark, and Neff 2002:127). The pots also could have served as containers to
transport roasted agave (Kelley 2000:152), salt, or other products. The nature of this trade network and
degree of involvement of groups inhabiting the Hueco Bolson remain to be determined.
Projectile points generally comprised a very small part of El Paso phase chipped stone assemblages,
as they had before A.D. 1300 (Miller 2007:3-10; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:255). An exception is Hot
Well; the 133 projectile points recovered from this pueblo include a number of complete specimens,
indicating manufacture or aggregation for hunting (Lowry 2005:189). Small triangular arrow points
were introduced during the El Paso phase, while recycling of scavenged dart points continued (Lowry
2005:304; Miller 1996e:73, 2007:3-6). Many projectile points were made of obsidian (Miller 2007:3-9;
Sayles 1935:Table 7).
Agricultural dependence and specialization increased during the El Paso phase, although subsistence was not based entirely on cultivated plants (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:251). Corn is present in
all floral assemblages dating to this phase, while beans, squash, and gourds are variably represented
(OâLaughlin 2005a:215). Ubiquity values for corn reached a peak of 60 percent in samples dating after
A.D. 1275/1300 (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:249). Larger manos comprised a greater part of ground
stone assemblages, and trough-shaped metates were preferred over grinding slabs (Hard, Mauldin, and
Raymond 1996:298; Lehmer 1948:81). A growing emphasis on accumulation of food reserves is indicated by increased construction and use of storage and refuse pits after A.D. 1200 (Miller 2005b:72).
Wild plant foods made up a smaller portion of the El Paso phase diet (OâLaughlin 2005a:221).
Ubiquity values for cacti, succulents, and non-cultivated plants fell to less than 10 percent in samples
dating after A.D. 1300, coinciding with a regional decline in use of the rock-lined pits that apparently
were used to process these plants (Miller 2005b:72; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:249).
Hunting continued to provide a minor part of the diet. Faunal samples from the Hot Well, Sergeant
Doyle, and La Cabrana pueblos indicate that jackrabbit and cottontail were the principal animals taken;
jackrabbit outnumbers cottontail substantially at two of the sites, and possibly was captured by means
of communal hunts (OâLaughlin 2005b:268-269, 274). The low number of arrow points at most El Paso
phase sites coincides with a scarcity of large animal remains (Miller 2007:3-10).
Structures occupied during the El Paso phase include freestanding one-room structures and pueblo
room blocks (Miller 2005b:70; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:240-241, 244), sometimes occurring on the
same site. Their construction differed primarily in terms of whether structures had common walls
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:239). Rooms generally were square, averaging around 4 m on a side (Graves
et al. 2001:153). Their shallow floors were plastered with adobe or caliche, and walls were made of
adobe built up in courses. Two to four main posts resting on rock base plates supported roofs spanned
by small branches, leaves, or plant stalks, and covered with grass and mud (Brook 1976:26; Lowry

41

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

2005:303â304; OâLaughlin 2005a:222). Features inside rooms included fire pits surrounded by plaster
collars, occasional storage or burial pits, and stepped entryways (Davis 1968:23; Lowry 2005:304; Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004:239-240).
Pueblo room blocks were laid out on two general plans, both resulting from incremental construction:
linear tiers, and (rarely) squares facing onto interior plazas (Lehmer 1948:80; Lowry 2005:304; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:242). Both freestanding and adjoining rooms typically had east/west alignments, with
doorways opening to the south (Brook 1979b:27; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:242). Many linear room
blocks included single larger rooms that may have had a communal function (Marshall 1973:95).
El Paso phase settlement generally was characterized by an increased number of large and small residential sites, a clustered settlement pattern, and decreased mobility, represented by higher artifact densities (Miller 2007:3-6, 3-9; Whalen 1978:33-34). Use of the central basin was non-intensive (Mauldin
1994:200-201) and there was a marked decline in occupation of alluvial fans, while occupations in proximity to playas reached a peak (Brook 1971:68; Miller 2005b:69, 72; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:238).
The large settlements may not have been occupied year round; many pueblo sites have relatively small
refuse middens given the capacity of their structures (Beckett and Wiseman 1979:399). In some rooms,
multiple floors are separated by windblown sand, indicating that they were occupied repeatedly but not
continuously (Carmichael 1990:130). Residential permanency at large sites may have been possible during wet years while seasonal movement would have been necessary during droughts (Miller 2007:3-7).
Mauldin (1986) has proposed a seasonal model of El Paso phase settlement, extrapolated from
Hardâs (1983a) model. Primary habitation sites would have been located near areas of greater soil moisture and agriculture would have been the main activity, beginning with spring planting. These sites
would have had formalized layouts, permanent structures, and well-defined refuse disposal areas; artifact assemblages would include numerous large ceramic vessels and ground stone tools with large grinding areas. After the summer rains began, primary sites would have been mostly abandoned in favor
of secondary habitation sites near ponds or other temporary water sources, occupied briefly by small
groups foraging for seasonally available plants and animals. Secondary site assemblages would be dominated by chipped stone artifacts, with few ground stone tools or ceramics. In the fall, groups would have
aggregated at primary habitation sites to harvest the crops, and relied on stored foods, limited hunting,
and dependable water sources to carry them through the winter (Mauldin 1986:258-264).
The end of the El Paso phase around A.D. 1450 is marked by the demise of pueblo occupations in the
Jornada Mogollon area, coinciding with region-wide depopulation of the southern Southwest by agricultural groups (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:258). Based on the scarcity of radiocarbon assays, it appears that
pueblo construction ceased and population levels plummeted (Miller 2005b:68; Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:258-259). The El Paso brownware ceramic tradition also ended (Miller 2001b:106). Although rapid
abandonment of the region is unlikely (Nelson and Hegmon 2001:231; Upham 1984:247), settlements in
the Jornada Mogollon area diminished considerably in number and scale after A.D. 1450.
The causes of these dramatic changes have not been determined. One of the more compelling theories is that climate change brought an end to the overspecialized El Paso phase agricultural economy,
causing populations to disperse to more productive areas and/or return to a simpler subsistence based
primarily on wild plants and animals (Tainter 1985:146-147; Upham 1984:248-249; Wimberly and Rogers 1977:450-453). Severe but short-term droughts between A.D. 1445 and 1450 (Grissino-Mayer et al.
1997:63) could have prompted groups to move to riverine areas (Bentley 1993:28-29), where occupations would be less evident archeologically due to burial by alluvium and extensive modern disturbance
(Miller 2001b:124, 128). Populations also may have gravitated to the north, as Jornada Style rock imagery elements appear in the upper Rio Grande valley after 1450 (Adams 1991:122-123, 139-144).

Prehistoric Background

Precontact and Protohistoric
The Precontact period in the Hueco Bolson began in 1450 and ended when Spanish explorers first
encountered native groups at the Paso del Norte in 1581; the Protohistoric period extended from that
date until 1659, when a mission was established at the pass and European contacts with native groups
became sustained (Miller 2007:3-1; Sale 1997:131-132). Very little archeological evidence of this 209year span has been identified with certainty. Historic accounts indicate that native groups identified
as Manso, Suma, and Apache occupied the Hueco Bolson and adjacent areas during the Protohistoric
period, and probably earlier. The ethnic identity and degree of relatedness of these people are poorly
known and not commonly agreed upon (Gerald 1974b:69; Shafer 1999:24-25). Forbes (1959:126-127)
has proposed that the three groups spoke Athapascan languages, while Beckett and Corbett (1992:39)
suspect that at least some of the Precontact/Protohistoric people in the Hueco Bolson descended from
El Paso phase populations. Historic documents indicate that the three groups mixed and intermarried
with each other, and with adjacent groups (Forbes 1959:109). Only the Apache Indians are reported to
have occupied the area around Hueco Tanks (see Historical Background).
The Manso Indians were first encountered near the Rio Grande above El Paso in 1598 (Gerald
1974c:117). Their territory extended from south of El Paso north to Hatch, New Mexico, east to the
Franklin and Organ Mountains, and west to the Florida Mountains (Bandelier 1890:165; Beckett and
Corbett 1992:2). They lived in straw huts and ate a diet including mesquite beans, fish, and corn (Beckett
1985:148; Beckett and Corbett 1992:25). By the 1620s, the Mansos lived in the vicinity of El Paso and
along the Rio Grande above it for 30 leagues (ca. 90 miles; Forbes 1994:126). In 1659 they settled at the
mission of Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe de los Mansos on the south side of the Rio Grande at Paso del
Norte (now Ciudad JuÃ¡rez; Beckett and Corbett 1992:5). Other groups entered the Guadalupe Mission
by 1668, including the Piro, Jumano, Suma, and Tano Indians (Gerald 1974c:120-121).
The Suma Indians were encountered along the Rio Grande below El Paso in the 1620s (Bandelier
1890:87; Forbes 1994:126; Gerald 1974b:70). They lived in brush shelters covered with hides, and survived on a diet of wild game and plants, supplemented by raiding (Gerald 1974b:74-75). After numerous attempts to bring the Sumas into missions, in 1692 Spanish missionaries persuaded them to move 7
leagues (ca. 21 miles) below El Paso to a pueblo named San Diego de los Sumas (Forbes 1994:232; Gerald 1974b:76-78). The Sumas, Mansos, and other native groups eventually intermarried, and remnants
joined Apache communities (Forbes 1959:124; 1994:xxi, 228).
The Apache Indians are descendants of Athapascan groups that may have entered central New Mexico as early as the 1200s or 1300s (Forbes 1994:xviii), but certainly by the 1500s (Wimberly and Rogers
1977:453-454). The term Apache came into use in the 1590s (Bandelier 1890:180; Forbes 1959:127).
By the 1620s, a group dubbed Apaches del Perillo lived near a spring of that name in the Jornada del
Muerto, and included bands that later were identified as Mescalero Apache (Forbes 1994:116-120;
Opler and Opler 1950:1; Schroeder 1973:127). In the mid-1600s, the term Mescalero was first applied
to Apaches occupying a territory extending from the Pecos River on the east to the Rio Grande on the
west, south into northern Mexico and north to the Sacramento Mountains (Opler and Opler 1950:2).
These Apache groups lived in tipis or brush structures covered with hides, and made a living primarily
by hunting (Bandelier 1890:178; Forbes 1959:127).
Recognition of Precontact/Protohistoric archeological components has been challenging, and
there is disagreement as to what constitutes sufficient proof of them (e.g., Kenmotsu and Miller 2008,
Lukowski et al. 2007:57-60; Seymour 2008). The few features of this age (Miller 2001b:117-120) typically
have been found on multicomponent sites, increasing the difficulty of their identification. Structures

43

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

described in historic accounts are informal straw, brush, and pole huts that bear a strong resemblance
to earlier pithouses, and their archeological signatures might be indistinguishable (Beckett 1985:150;
Miller 2001b:149). A greater percentage of hearths dated to this period include rocks than in the periods that precede and follow it, but similar rock hearths are known from the Archaic period (Miller
2001b:122-123). In the San Andres Mountains of southern New Mexico, large (greater than 10 m diameter) rock-lined pits on sites LA72169 and LA72860 date to the 1600s, and Mescalero Apaches may have
used them for roasting agave (Sale 1991:56-57; Miller 2001b:119). Smaller (ca. 1 m diameter) rock-lined
pits at sites HAR163 and HAR166 also date to the Precontact/Protohistoric period (Sale 1997:140).
These findings suggest that exceptionally large and/or well-preserved fire-cracked rock features may
indicate late occupations (Miller 2001b:154; Sale 1991:67). Circles of unmodified stones on the Cerro
Rojo site (LA37188) are said to represent hide-covered huts (Seymour 2004:163-165), but little information has been presented on their metric attributes or age (Kenmotsu and Miller 2008:226-228).
Artifacts indicating the Precontact/Protohistoric periodsâincluding Tabira Black-on-white and
late glazeware ceramics, metal and glass arrow points, and glass trade beadsâhave rarely been found
on sites in the Hueco Bolson (Miller 2001b:124; Sale 1997:140-141; Seymour 2004:168). Other artifacts
associated with this period have not been identified unequivocally. Seymour (2002, 2003, 2004) has
asserted that chipped stone tools and ceramics are Apache, but has not explained how they are distinguished from similar items dating to other periods. Ceramics are rarely mentioned in historic accounts
and could have been almost absent (Bandelier 1892:349; Beckett 1985:150), so Precontact/Protohistoric
occupations may look Archaic (Beckett 1985:150; Miller 2001b:115, 122). Arrow points might include
the Soto type, which resembles Garza arrow points that date between 1450 and 1650 in the Texas Panhandle-Plains, but Soto points are uncommon north of the Rio Grande and are not well-dated (Boyd
1997:428-429; Miller 2001b:126, 129; Phelps 1987:9, 16, 19). Other arrow points apparently include
small triangular side-notched or basally-notched forms similar to those found on El Paso phase sites
(Miller 2001b:128).
Settlement during the Precontact/Protohistoric period was widespread, involving use of floodplain/
terrace, basin, and mountain landforms (Miller 2001b:122-123). The Mansos frequented the Rio Grande
valley and were less mobile, but did not dwell in permanent houses, while the Sumas were highly mobile
(Bandelier 1890:88; 1892:349; Miller 2001b:148-149). The Apaches were known to occupy hilltops with
commanding views of surrounding areas (Seymour 2004:158).
To date, radiocarbon assays have provided the only incontrovertible evidence of the Precontact/
Protohistoric period in the Hueco Bolson (Miller 2001b:115, 122, 124). Limited chronometric data
indicate Protohistoric presence at the multicomponent Cerro Rojo site in the Hueco Mountains, 7.5
miles north-northeast of Hueco Tanks. The site covers ca. 130 acres on a prominent hilltop that offers
views for miles. Over 250 features are clustered in several loci, including tipi rings, circles of rock boulders or slabs, cleared areas, roasting pits, dry-laid rock walls, cairns, and historic buildings; some of
these features represent structures that probably were occupied intermittently (Seymour 2002:107-153,
2004:160). Formative period and historic components on the site are evidenced by artifacts and three
radiocarbon assays; two other assays on Feature 100, a cluster of fire-cracked rock and ash, fall into the
Precontact/Protohistoric period with date ranges from A.D. 1490 to 1950 and A.D. 1640 to 1950 (Kenmotsu and Miller 2008:235, 237; Seymour 2002:119, D-18). Seymour (2004:168-170) recognized seven
protohistoric ceramic types at the site but provided insufficient information to allow for their identification; they appear to fall within the range of prehistoric El Paso brownware (Kenmotsu and Miller
2008:230). Similarly, chipped stone tools and debitage said to be distinctive of the Apaches and Mansos
(Seymour 2004:170-181) are interchangeable based on their descriptions, and new projectile point designations resemble known types (Kenmotsu and Miller 2008:232-234). The same line of reasoning led

Prehistoric Background

Seymour (2002:125-126) to identify site 41EP5562 as an Apache encampment; located in an overlook
setting on a porphyritic syenite hill 4 miles northwest of Hueco Tanks, it has comparable artifacts and
features, but has not been dated by radiocarbon assay.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES NEAR HUECO TANKS STATE PARK AND HISTORIC SITE
Several significant archeological sites in the vicinity of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site
represent occupations and/or activities that almost certainly had a bearing on prehistoric use of the
Tanks. Sabina Mountain #2 and Hot Well are nearby pueblos dating to the El Paso phase; the latter is the
largest known pueblo in the Hueco Bolson. Another group of significant sites consists of over 100 caves
on an outlying Hueco Mountain foothill, the best-known of which is Ceremonial Cave. Information on
these sites is summarized here, and will play a role in interpreting the culture history and archeological
significance of Hueco Tanks.
Hot Well Pueblo
The Hot Well site (41EP5) is an El Paso phase pueblo located 6 miles northwest of Hueco Tanks,
occupied primarily between A.D. 1100 and 1400 (Lowry 2005:295). The site covers 60 acres, almost 11
of which encompass known rooms; it is said to be the largest Jornada Mogollon pueblo in the Hueco
Bolson (Bentley 1993:23). Forty-seven rooms have been excavated, and the total number of rooms is
estimated to be over 100 (Bentley 1993:28; Lowry 2005:303). Structures were found in three areas containing two or more linear room blocks, spaced over 100 m apart; a fourth area is known through testing
of a single room (Scarborough 1986; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:242-244).
The long axes of the pueblo room blocks were oriented east-west, with doorways opening to the
south (Brook 1979b:27). At least seven rooms had adobe steps inside the doorways (Brook 1967:Table
1). Walls apparently averaged 1.5 to 1.8 m high, and were made of local clay mixed with adobe, poured
into forms to build up the walls in 45- to 60-cm courses (Lowry 2005:303). Floors ranged from 10 to 50
cm below ground surface (Brook 1979b:27). Two to four posts were set into the floors to support roof
beams, overlaid by sotol and/or lechuguilla stalks and topped with a layer of grass or succulent leaves
and mud. The cottonwood roof beams in Room 17 of Hot Well pueblo may have been obtained from
Hueco Tanks, the nearest current location of those trees (Lowry 2005: 304; OâLaughlin 2005a:222).
Several rooms at Hot Well have notable aspects. Room 17 was larger than the other rooms in Block
1 of Area 1; set into its floor were three cache pits containing 917 beads made of marine shell and other
materials, indicating that the room may have been used for communal or ceremonial purposes (Brook
1976:27; Lowry 2005:65-66; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:244). The caliche wall plaster in Room 5 of Area
3 was decorated with red, white, and black painted lines, and a bird was sculpted in bas relief on one wall
(Davis 1968:27-28; Lowry 2005:124-125). Brook (1979b:29, 35, 38) suggested that Room 1 in Block 1
of Area 1 was aligned to record sunrise on the spring equinox and winter solstice, but admitted that the
walls of adjacent rooms would have blocked the sunâs rays.
An artificial reservoir is located 400 m southeast of the pueblo, linked to it by a scatter of artifacts
(Bentley 1993:23). Sediment was removed from a natural solution cavity in the underlying caliche, two
steps were cut into the substrate to allow walk-in access, and the bottom was sealed with caliche plaster
(Scarborough 1988:26, 30-31). Positioned on an alluvial fan channel to capture runoff from the Hueco

45

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Mountains, the reservoir measured 24 by 13 m by 1.8 m and had an estimated capacity of 182 cubic m
(ca. 48,000 gallons; Scarborough 1988:26). Although residents probably obtained most of their water
from a playa west of the pueblo, when the reservoir was filled to capacity it would have substantially
increased the length of time and/or number of people that could live there (Bentley 1993:27-28; Scarborough 1988:36). During dry periods, the nearest source of semi-permanent water was Hueco Tanks,
6 miles to the southeast (Bentley 1993:6).
Over 36,000 ceramic sherds were recovered from excavations at Hot Well, and 96 percent are El Paso
Brownware; El Paso Polychrome comprises almost all of the brownware sherds that can be identified
to type (Lowry 2005:198-199). Source analyses suggest that clay derived from Cerro Altoâan igneous peak located 9 miles southeast of Hot Well and 4 miles northeast of Hueco Tanksâwas used to
manufacture this pottery, and caches of clay, temper, and smoothing tools were found in rooms (Bentley
1992a:389-390, 393-394, 1995; Lowry 2005:200-201). Syenite comprised most of the ceramic temper
identified in macroscopic and chemical analyses (Bentley 1995).
The chipped stone artifacts at Hot Well were made primarily of chert and limestone, readily available from the Hueco Mountains and nearby outliers (Lowry 2005:181-192). Syenite is another local rock
that was used for the single pestle and 40 percent of the metates and fragments (Lowry 2005: 178-179,
197). It could have been obtained 2 miles southeast of the pueblo at Cathedral Mountain, from outcrops
at the base of the Hueco Mountains, or at Hueco Tanks (Collins and Raney 2000).
Floral and faunal remains indicate that the diet at Hot Well was typical of El Paso phase pueblos,
with a few exceptions. Cultivated corn, beans, and squash were augmented by wild plant foods including mesquite and tornillo pods, and yucca and prickly pear fruits (OâLaughlin 2005a:231). The meat
diet consisted primarily of jackrabbit and cottontail. Deer and pronghorn remains, though not abundant, are represented in greater numbers than in other El Paso phase faunal assemblages (OâLaughlin
2005b:269), and could have been obtained from mountain and basin areas near the pueblo. Birds, bird
eggs, and rodents comprised a small part of the diet (OâLaughlin 2005b:240-248).
Sabina Mountain #2 Pueblo
Sabina Mountain #2 (41EP4) is a pueblo positioned on the edge of a playa, 8 miles south-southwest
of Hueco Tanks. Two archeomagnetic samples from hearths generally date the site to the El Paso phase,
between A.D. 1300 and 1400 (Brook 1980:45; Robinson 2008:95-96).
Fourteen rooms were identified by the El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS), and remnants of
floors and walls from additional rooms were found during testing by the Texas Archeological Society
(Robinson 2008:66-67). Brook (1980:21) estimated that there were 25 to 50 structures originally. Of
the nine rooms excavated by EPAS, six were arrayed in pairs oriented east-west and at least two were
freestanding (Brook 1980:22). The rooms had two to four major roof support posts and doorways that
opened to the south, and contained adobe steps and fire hearths (Brook 1978a:8, 1980:21, 73-74). None
of the excavated rooms was substantially larger than the others (Graves et al. 2001:74).
The ceramics collected by EPAS are most representative of the site (cf. Robinson 2008:84-91). A
surface collection yielded 96 percent El Paso Polychrome and 2 percent Chupadero Black-on-white
sherds, and room excavations produced 90 percent El Paso Polychrome, 3 percent Chupadero Black-onwhite, and 3 percent El Paso Brown (Brook 1980:20, 66-67). One El Paso Polychrome rim fragment with
modeled step frets and lip perforations is from a bowl that may have had a ceremonial purpose (Brook
1976:25, 1980:65).
46

Prehistoric Background

Stone artifacts included 63 projectile points; most were made of chert and a lesser number of
obsidian, both available locally (Brook 1980:55-58, 75; Robinson 2008:80-81). One mano would be
classified as large according to the criteria of Hard, Mauldin, and Raymond (1996:260), while four others
were small (Brook 1980:21, 46). Trough and slab metates were represented in roughly equal numbers,
the majority made of sandstone (Brook 1980:44; Robinson 2008:82). Other ground stone tools were
made from sandstone, vesicular basalt, and an unidentified igneous rock (Brook 1980:21, 46); the latter
could be syenite, the nearest available igneous rock in this area (see Environmental Background section).
A limited number of unique items were found scattered across the site, including shell beads and
pendants, turquoise pendants, unworked copper, a stone palette, and two shaped and incised pieces of
sandstone (Brook 1980:46, 58-59, 67, 70). One fossil crinoid columnal and three brachiopods probably
were obtained from a nearby Hueco Mountain outlier (Brook 1980:70, 76). Two fish-shaped shell pendants were cached beneath the floor of Room 3 (Brook 1971:72, 1980:28, 59).
Information on diet at Sabina Mountain Site #2 is limited, but carbonized plant remains included
corn kernels and cob fragments, a bean, and mesquite and yucca seeds (Green 1980). The meat part of
the diet apparently consisted of jackrabbits, squirrels, and other small game; birds and eggshells also
were in evidence (Brook 1980:74; Robinson 2008:93-94).
Hueco Mountain Caves and Rockshelters
A number of caves and rockshelters in the Hueco Mountains and outlying foothills were used in
prehistoric times. These shelters were formed through solution of limestone, unlike the rockshelters at
Hueco Tanks which formed in fissures and under boulders of porphyritic syenite. The dry, stable conditions inside the shelters preserve items that typically do not survive in open archeological sites (Almarez
and Leach 1997:11). Although not entirely similar, the contents of the Hueco Mountain caves and rockshelters provide a general indication of the cultural deposits that may be preserved in the shelters at
Hueco Tanks.
Archeological sites in the Hueco Mountain caves are known through a number of investigations,
beginning in 1927 (Almarez and Leach 1997; Alves 1930, 1932; Betancourt and Ralph 1981; Cosgrove
1947; OâLaughlin 1977; Roberts 1929; Sayles 1935; Sutherland 1976; Whalen 1977; Woolsey 1936). The
greatest concentration of caves is in an outlying foothill ca. 3 miles west of Hueco Tanks, where some
130 shelters have been located. A few cave sites are recorded on the west edge of the main range; Cosgroveâs Cave 9 and Cave 10 (41EP13) are at the mouth of a canyon 5 miles north of Hueco Tanks (Cosgrove 1947:40), while the Four-Plex Caves (41EP36) are in a small canyon 6 miles south of the Tanks
(Betancourt and Ralph 1981:105, 108).
The caves in the Hueco Mountain outlier are at the base of a cliff of Hueco Canyon limestone
(Collins and Raney 2000). Sitting 200 to 450 ft above the basin floor, they can be accessed by scaling a
rocky talus slope, and a ledge connects many of them (Cosgrove 1947:33). A number of the caves face
northwest or west (Roberts 1929:2), although some face south (Almarez and Leach 1997:53; OâLaughlin
1977:170). Nearby water sources are limited, consisting of rain-filled basins in the cliffs (Cosgrove
1947:33), and intermittent springs or seeps in canyons (Almarez and Leach 1997:53).
Of the 130 shelters that have been identified on this landform, over half (n = 72, 55 percent) show
evidence of prehistoric or historic use, although surface indications of occupation are scant in many of
them (Almarez and Leach 1997:41, 45; OâLaughlin 1977:169; Whalen 1977:132). Recorded archeological sites include both caves and rockshelters: the Texas Speleological Survey defines a cave as a cavity in
47

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

which no dimension of the entrance exceeds the overall length or depth, while rockshelters have at least
one entrance dimension that exceeds the length or depth of the shelter. Dimensions available for 10 of
the sites examined by Cosgrove (1947) and OâLaughlin (1977) indicate that all are caves, except Picture
Cave and Cosgroveâs Cave 2.
In terms of size, the shelters range from extensive to small. Cosgroveâs investigations included some
of the largest caves/rockshelters: Picture Cave (41EP1) and Ceremonial Cave (41EP19) are estimated to
encompass between 500 and 650 square m, while Caves 5, 6, and 7 range from 130 to 290 square m. Most
of the caves/rockshelters are much smaller; of the 62 archeological sites for which dimensions are available, only 8 (13 percent) encompass over 100 square m, and 22 (35 percent) enclose less than 20 square
m (Almarez and Leach 1997:89-157). The caves investigated by OâLaughlin (1977) are mid-sized; East
and West Cave encompass 62.5 and 56 square m, respectively.
Depth of the cultural deposits is known from two excavation projects. Tests in East and West Caves
encountered deposits ranging from 40 to 50 cm over bedrock (OâLaughlin 1977:170). In the large caves
that Cosgrove studied, the cultural deposits were thicker; excavations in Ceremonial Cave reached
depths of 30 to 152 cm, and the deposits in Caves 1, 2, 4, and 7 ranged from 30 to 91 cm thick (Cosgrove
1947:35-39).
These shelters apparently were not used for habitation but were reserved primarily for ceremonial purposes. Ceremonial Cave produced utilitarian items in astonishing numbers, including sandals,
wooden darts tipped with points, basketry, and other items. Non-utilitarian items were less numerous,
but included beads and pendants of shell and stone, shell bracelets, prayer sticks, and fragments of
tablitasâterraced headdresses made of split yucca stalks tied or glued together and painted (Cosgrove
1947:34-35; OâLaughlin 1977:175; Sayles 1935:Table 6). The quantity and variety of materials found in
this cave are unparalleled in the region (Creel 1997:83). The absence of domestic features like hearths
and the presence of many items interpreted as offerings led Cosgrove (1947:36) and Creel (1997:81, 84)
to believe that the principal use of this cave was ceremonial, although limited habitation evidence was
found in one area. Cosgrove (1947:166) further surmised that none of the Hueco Mountain caves were
permanent domiciles, and they were only used as shelters in emergencies. In East and West Cave, nonutilitarian artifacts indicated ceremonial activities, while habitation appeared to be marginal due to the
scarcity of grinding implements, fire-cracked rock, and hearths (OâLaughlin 1977:169, 176-178).
The abundant items fashioned from plant and animal materials recovered from Ceremonial Cave are
too numerous to list. Many were made of yucca leaves or stalks, including around 1300 fragmentary, worn,
and complete sandals (Creel 1997:81; Cosgrove 1947:35-36). Two styles (Figure 7) predominated among
the 626 sandals that were sufficiently complete to measure: two-warp scuffer toe (n = 234, 37 percent) and
four-warp short scuffer toe (n = 112, 18 percent; Cosgrove 1947:82-85, 89). Other items included yucca
baskets, netting, and cordage; yucca stalks with attached yucca fiber bolls containing tobacco; reed cigarettes and reed arrows; atlatls, darts, and foreshafts; and hardwood throwing sticks (Cosgrove 1947:36-37).
The nearest source for the reeds would have been the Rio Grande (OâLaughlin 1977:175). Cotton cordage
also was recovered and probably was imported, as no evidence of cotton cultivation is known in the region
(OâLaughlin 1977:174). These items also were found in the other caves in lesser amounts.
Food remains were recovered from the Hueco Mountain caves, though not in great quantity. They
included corncobs, squash and gourd rinds, chewed agave and yucca fiber quids, mesquite beans, yucca
and grass seeds, and bones of mule deer, pronghorn, bighorn sheep, coyote, dog, badger, cottontail,
ground squirrel, hawk, great horned owl, California condor, and tortoise. These species were available
in the region, and many in the vicinity of the caves; some of the animals could have entered the caves as
occupants or prey (Cosgrove 1947:36; Creel 1997:86; OâLaughlin 1977:178-187).

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Rock imagery is not common in the Hueco Mountain caves; only 4 of the 72 shelters that are
recorded as sites contain pictographs (cf. Almarez and Leach 1997:46). The greatest quantity and variety of images are in Picture Cave, a large rockshelter located ca. 1 mile southwest of Ceremonial Cave
(Cosgrove 1947:155-158; Roberts 1929:2). Painted in red pigment, a number of elements are stylistically similar to the imagery at Hueco Tanks (Sutherland 1976:2). Ceremonial Cave, Cosgroveâs Cave 2,
and East Cave contain a few faint pictographs; some are only traces of pigment (OâLaughlin 1977:170;
Whalen 1977:133-135;).
Human burials have been found in four Hueco Mountain caves. Ceremonial Cave contained the
disturbed remains of an infant and an adult female wrapped in remnants of a rabbit-fur blanket, among
surface materials in an alcove (Cosgrove 1947:161; Creel 1997:84). In nearby Cave 1, a shallow grave
contained the remains of an infant and an adult, swathed in fur-cloth blankets (Cosgrove 1947:161;
Creel 1997:85). In the early 1980s, human remains were exhumed from a cave later recorded as FB5120,
and in the mid-1990s, an isolated human bone was found in site FB11108, a large cave (Almarez and
Leach 1997:44, 56, 94).
The period of use of the Hueco Mountain caves is not well known, due to the small number of timediagnostic artifacts and paucity of radiocarbon assays. Lehmer (1948:75) placed most of the artifacts
recovered by Cosgrove in his Hueco (Late Archaic) phase. Sayles (1935:67) surmised that the caves had
been occupied or re-occupied over a long period of time, their upper levels dating to the El Paso phase.
Cosgrove asserted that Ceremonial Cave was similar to âsacred retreats visited numberless times by the
Puebloâ, and âpreviously had been long used as a Basket-maker [pre-A.D. 700] depositoryâ (Cosgrove
1947:168). Of the 13 Hueco Mountain cave sites recorded in 1977, Whalen (1977:132) estimated that
10 had El Paso phase occupations and 6 had occupations that might date to the Archaic period, while
OâLaughlin (1977:169) interpreted the same data as indicating use of the caves primarily during the El
Paso phase. Creel (1997:83, 87) suggested that use of Ceremonial Cave as a shrine was most common
between A.D. 700 and 1450 based on the presence of an El Paso Polychrome sherd and arrow fragments,
while noting that dart points could indicate earlier use. Recently, radiocarbon assays on the organic elements of three hafted dart points from Ceremonial Cave yielded two-sigma age spans falling at the end
of the Late Archaic period, between 400 B.C. and A.D. 220 (Creel 2009).
Opportunities to resolve the use and time span of the Hueco Mountain caves are dwindling, due to
decades of indiscriminate digging and collection, beginning in the 1920s (Almarez and Leach 1997:59).
Extensive vandalism and looting have almost destroyed many of the archeological deposits, as they
have either been removed or completely disturbed (OâLaughlin 1977:170; Whalen 1977:132). Another
destructive impact is mining; rubble from a shaft in Ceremonial Cave covered a substantial part of the
cultural deposit by the time A. M. Woolsey reached the site in 1936 (Creel 1997:79; Woolsey 1936:12).
Mining also impacted site FB11108, which contains human remains (Almarez and Leach 1997:147148). Recent damage includes refuse, graffiti, and fires set by transient visitors (Almarez and Leach
1997:59-60). The record contained in the Hueco Mountain caves will never be fully known.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AT HUECO TANKS STATE PARK AND HISTORIC SITE
Archeological investigations of Hueco Tanks began in the mid-nineteenth century and continue to
the present. In this section, they are divided into early visits, rock imagery recording, rock imagery restoration, survey, and excavation. The Tanks contain one of the greatest known concentrations of Jornada
Mogollon pictographs, and most of the archeological work to date has focused on rock imagery. The
single largest project consisted of two phases of excavation at Hueco Tanks Village, however.
50

Prehistoric Background

A number of designations have been assigned to Hueco Tanks by individuals and institutions over
the past 75 years, as indicated on the key site card at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of The
University of Texas at Austin (TARL): Site 25 by Eileen Alves (Sayles 1932); Site 37 (Brand 1933:Plate
10), El Paso County Site No. 2 (Jackson 1938:10), El Paso:2:5 by E. B. Sayles (1932), El Paso Centennial
Museum site 31:106:4:22, University of Texas at Austin sites 30B3-1 and WT-1417, and El Paso Archaeological Society site 96. Trinomial 41EP2 is the current designation, and encompasses the entire park; it
probably was assigned to Hueco Tanks prior to 1961 (Carolyn Spock, personal communication 2004).
This area was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, and officially designated as a State
Archeological Landmark in 1983.
A system for designating the rock imagery sites at Hueco Tanks was developed by Forrest Kirkland
(Kirkland and Kirkland 1939), and has been enhanced by Evelyn Billo and Robert Mark (Harry et al.
2001). It is used in this report for clarity, even though many of the previous investigations precede it.
Early Visits
The earliest published descriptions of Hueco Tanks archeology were written in the mid-nineteenth
century by persons traveling along the trail that led through the Tanks (see Historical Background). The
Duval-Harris party stopped there in 1849, and Harris later described the pictographs, including rock
imagery site N6E (Dillon 1960:49-50; Moody 1963:86: Davis and Toness 1974:58). John Russell Bartlett
of the International Boundary Commission stopped at the Tanks in March 1851; he camped near rock
imagery site N17G and sketched those pictographs, as well as images at rock imagery sites N17, W21(?),
SE23, and SE24 (Bartlett 1854:170-173; Mallery 1893:115-116).
Early in the twentieth century, Hueco Tanks began to draw the attention of archeologists. Frank H.
H. Roberts of the Smithsonian Institution Bureau of Ethnology apparently visited the Tanks in 1921
(Creel 1997:76; Roberts 1929:1), and/or 1927 (El Paso Post, September 15, 1927) during a trip to view
Ceremonial Cave and nearby caves. A. T. Jackson of the University of Texas at Austin made brief visits to
Hueco Tanks in 1927 and 1935, and photographed and sketched pictographs at rock imagery sites E01,
E06, E10-12, W13, N17, SE23, and SE25 (Jackson 1935, 1938:10-21).
After the El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS) was formed in 1922, members began to record
the rock imagery at Hueco Tanks. One of them was professional photographer Otis A. Aultman, who
became vice-president of the society (Hedrick 1972:52; Walsh 1950:1). EPAS member Colonel M. L.
Crimmins published descriptions and sketches of pictographs at the Tanks. He estimated that there were
about 2,000 images, and recommended that the state of Texas acquire Hueco Tanks in order to protect
them (Crimmins 1931:29-30).
Hueco Tanks was one of 4 archeological sites near El Paso that Donald Brand surveyed in 19301931, for comparison to 400 sites in Chihuahua (Brand 1933:Appendix III:69; Rakita and Raymond
2003:167, 173). Brand collected 38 sherds from the Tanks, classified as 16 El Paso Polychrome, 9 Chupadero Black-on-white, 8 unclassified painted, 2 corrugated, 1 Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, 1 Little
Colorado Black-on-red (St. Johns Polychrome; Carlson 1970:31), and 1 indented rim redware (Playas
Red?) (Brand 1933:Plate 10; Rakita and Raymond 2003:173). Along with 61 El Paso brownware sherds
and ca. 8 chipped stone artifacts, this collection is curated at the Hearst Museum of the University of
California, Berkeley (Thomas Hester, undated notes on file at TARL, personal communication 2008).
E. B. Sayles visited Hueco Tanks in November 1932 and photographed rock imagery sites E01A and
E06A-D (Sayles 1932). Sayles also collected El Paso brownware, El Paso Bichrome/Polychrome, and
51

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Chupadero Black-on-white ceramic sherds, and a few chipped stone artifacts, now curated at TARL. A.
M. Woolsey visited the Tanks in 1936, but conducted no investigations: âA trip was made to Hueco tanks
on Friday, March 13, but no new caves could be found near the tanks. Sixteen caves were visited Sat. but
none of these were considered valuable enough to workâ (Woolsey 1936:1).
Rock Imagery Recording
The first systematic rock imagery recording at Hueco Tanks was undertaken by Forrest and Lula
Kirkland in July of 1939, on the recommendation of A. T. Jackson (Kirkland 1939). The Kirklands
(primarily Lula) found images in 13 overhanging cliffs, 23 niches and crevices, and 37 of the ca. 60
smoke-stained rockshelters that they examined (Kirkland and Kirkland 1939; Kirkland 1940:9). Shelters near the natural water tanks had the greatest quantity and variety of imagery (Kirkland 1940:9).
Forrest devised a designation system for the Hueco Tanks pictographs; he assigned sequential numbers
to 27 clusters of rock imagery panels, plotting them on a map where he labeled the rock hills as North,
East, and West Mountains. Within each rock imagery site, groups of images were indicated by letter
suffixes, beginning at the left end of the site (Kirkland and Kirkland 1939). Over a period of 10 days,
Forrest Kirkland made precise watercolor copies of hundreds of pictographs (Figure 8). Kirklandâs
images were published in 1967 (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:173-203), and his designation system is
used to this day.

After a hiatus of three decades, scholarly interest in the rock imagery of Hueco Tanks was renewed
when the state of Texas acquired the property in 1969 (see Historical Background). More pictographs
were soon discovered; anthropologist Nicholas Houser located rock site E28 in 1969, and site W29
(Cave of the Masks) also came to light around that time (Binion 1970:43). Site N30 (Cave Kiva) was
first reported by EPAS members Kay Toness and Mack Hill. The images had been found in 1956 by Hill
52

Prehistoric Background

and his Boy Scout group, but inscriptions dating to 1941 near the pictographs indicated that others had
been there before them (Toness and Hill 1972:4). Due to the inaccessibility of the cave, Toness and Hill
(1972:13-14) suggested that it may have been used for ceremonial purposes.
In December 1971, John Davis recruited fellow EPAS members and the Anthropology Club of the
University of Texas at El Paso to inventory the 1,200 images recorded by Kirkland, note any damage, and
assess its causes (Davis and Toness 1974:5). During 23 days between January and October of 1972, Mike
Bilbo, John and Marguerite Davis, Tom and Cynthia Martin, Odin and Kay Toness, and other EPAS
and Club members relocated, sketched, and photographed the pictographs (Bilbo 1972a, 1972b, 1972c;
Davis and Toness 1974:2; Toness 1972). They found 300 additional images that had not been noted by
Kirkland, recording them as addenda to existing sites and as new sites W31, N32, N33, E34, N35, W36,
W37, N38, W39, and E40 (Davis and Toness 1974:57). Condition assessments indicated that 25 percent
of the panels recorded by Kirkland had been destroyed; of the 75 percent remaining, half had suffered
some type of damage, mainly from graffiti and picnic fires (Davis and Toness 1974:8). Anthropologist Toness (later Sutherland) became interested in rock imagery and began analyzing and classifying
the Hueco Tanks pictographs, which became her lifelong passion (Sutherland 1975, 1991, 1995, 1996;
Sutherland and Geise 1992; Sutherland and Parker 1991; Toness 1973, 1974).
Rock imagery documentation resumed in 1977 when Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD)
archeologist Ronald W. Ralph asked EPAS member Mike Bilbo to plot rock imagery sites and other cultural resources on large-scale TPWD contour maps and aerial photographs (Sutherland 1978:83). In the
course of this work, Bilbo located new imagery sites E41, SE42, SE43, and W44 (Bilbo 1978; Ralph 1999;
cf. Riskind 1994). In 1991, Ralph spearheaded an effort to make detailed records of panels threatened
by vandalism, and led a group of TPWD employees and volunteers who compiled measured sketches,
photographs, and watercolor paintings of rock imagery sites E01, N15, E17, N17, N18, W20, W21, N30,
N35, and W44 during four work sessions in 1991 and 1992 (Montgomery 1994). Concerned with the
slow pace of documentation, Ralph (1993) recommended that TPWD contract for a park-wide rock
imagery survey.
Beginning in the mid 1990s, attempts were made to directly date Hueco Tanks rock imagery pigment at sites E12, W20, SE23, SE24, and SE28 via radiocarbon assay (Hyman et al. 1999; Rowe 1996,
2005). Charcoal and/or organic binder was extracted from pigment samples by means of low-temperature, low-pressure oxygen and argon plasmas, and dated via accelerator mass spectrometry. Eight of the
17 samples were red, white, or black inorganic pigments that did not yield sufficient carbon to be dated
(Hyman and Rowe 1997:68). Nine black organic pigment (charcoal?) samples representing the five rock
imagery sites (four from W20 and two from SE23) produced dates spanning the Mesilla, DoÃ±a Ana, and
El Paso phases. Two-sigma calibrated age spans ranged from A.D. 410-1020 to A.D. 1210-1390 (Hyman
et al. 1999:76; Rowe 2005:91). Two sample pairs were assayed; the two-sigma age ranges of one pair were
almost identical, while the age spans of the second pair barely overlapped (Rowe 2005:91). The organic
material in these samples was not identified and the dates were not corrected for isotopic fractionation,
so they should be considered provisional (Hyman et al. 1999:77, 86). The possibility of organic contamination on the rocks where the pictographs were painted was not evaluated, and could have influenced
the dates (Ilger et al. 1995:309). Cultural practices also may affect the accuracy of pictograph dating;
because charcoal on rockshelter floors may be preserved indefinitely, if it was used for pictographs, the
age of the pigment could predate the drawings by a considerable margin (Rowe 2005:92).
In 1999, TPWD contracted with Evelyn Billo and Robert Mark of Rupestrian CyberServices to create
a digital rock imagery database for Hueco Tanks. They recorded 273 panels, including 34 which were
discovered during the project (Harry et al. 2001:154). The panels were designated by prefacing Forrest
Kirklandâs designations with letters indicating the mountains where the panels were found, and adding

leading zeros to rock imagery site numbers below 10. Former TPWD park ranger and rock imagery
scholar David Parker guided Billo and Mark to many of the 17 new sites, over half of which were on East
Mountain: SE45, SE46, E47, E48, N49, N50, N51, E52, W53, E54, W55, E56, SE57, E58, E59, E 60, and
E61. Each panel was photographed (Figure 9), mapped via GPS, and entered into a GIS database. Billo
and Mark also compiled a portfolio of ca. 6,000 images, including photographs by John Davis, Kirklandâs
paintings, and other existing records. In the process of scanning and filtering the photographs they took
in 1999, Mark discovered that digital color enhancement revealed pictographs invisible to the naked eye
(Mark and Billo 2002; 2006:12-14). The comprehensive Rupestrian CyberServices database facilitates
relocation and protection of the rock imagery at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site (Harry et al.
2001:154-156).
Inventory of the rock imagery at Hueco Tanks is a long term endeavor and may never be fully
achieved, as many panels are in locations that are difficult to access, and every project has revealed heretofore unknown images.
Rock Imagery Restoration
Since the 1840s, visitors to Hueco Tanks have commemorated their presence by marking their
names and dates on the rocks. While nineteenth-century inscriptions are relatively rare and have historical significance, the number of inscriptions grew rapidly during the twentieth century (see Features,
54

Prehistoric Background

Structures, and Distributions), as they increasingly overlapped the rock imagery. By the 1990s gang
tagging became problematic, along with the use of spray paint and permanent markers (El Paso HeraldPost, November 26, 1992). Efforts to remove modern graffiti from rock imagery began in 1969 when the
property was transferred to the state of Texas (see Historical Background). The earliest attempts, though
well-intentioned, were considerably more damaging and less effective than the work of professional
conservators, which began in 1993.
Shortly after the park opened to the public, it was reported that âThe state park people are trying
to get all of the 20th century graffito off the walls of the tanksâ (Dallas Morning News, May 17, 1970).
In 1972, EPAS members discovered that park staff were sandblasting twentieth-century inscriptions
from rock imagery site E01, and asked that the work stop until the panel was fully documented (Bilbo
1972c:1; Bilbo and Bilbo 1995:241). Some images overlain by recent graffiti were lost to aggressive cleaning during this period.
In December 1978 and March 1979, TPWD archeologist Ron Ralph, Park Rangers David Parker
and Dan Olivas, and Kay Sutherland conducted a rock imagery conservation experiment under the
authority of Texas Antiquities Permit 188. They used household cleansers and paint strippers to
remove graffiti on and near images at sites N15A and B and SE27, following procedures developed
by the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission (Ralph 1996:174-175; Ralph and Sutherland 1979:285). The cleansers removed charcoal and soot with varying success; paint strippers were
primarily effective on spray paint less than two years old (Ralph 1996:174-175; Ralph and Sutherland 1979:290). Ralph and Sutherland recommended eradication of spray-painted graffiti as soon as
possible, and further research on graffiti removal as part of a site-wide restoration effort (Ralph and
Sutherland 1979:285, 290).
In the early 1980s, TPWD park rangers applied the methods tested by Ralph and Sutherland to
remove graffiti from additional rock imagery. In September 1981, rangers used commercial bathroom
cleanser to lift recent charcoal marks near four masks in Cave Kiva (rock imagery site N30), covering
residual stains with bonding cement mixed with paint (Parker 1981?). During the summer of 1983,
they removed charcoal and spray paint from rock imagery sites E01A, E03B, N15C, N16C, N17D, and
N18, using a variety of methods, cleansers, and solvents. Parker disguised scars from a thwarted attempt
to steal a panel at site N16C with a mixture of paint and bonding cement. At rock imagery sites E01A
and 17D, Bilbo found that historic images and inscriptions could be damaged by fluids including water
(Bilbo 1983). This was proved again in 1984, when an unauthorized attempt by Boy Scouts to scrub
graffiti from rock imagery site E6 (Comanche Cave) resulted in the loss of at least six historic images
(Bilbo and Bilbo 1995:241). A graffiti cleaning agent tested at rock imagery site N15 in 1984 removed
graffiti less than one year old but also affected the prehistoric images, so was not recommended (Ralph
1997:106-107).
Professional restoration efforts began in 1993, when TPWD contracted with conservator J. Claire
Dean of Portland, Oregon for the first of a series of projects to evaluate and restore the rock imagery
at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site. In August 1993, Dean inspected many of the rock imagery
sites and found that natural weathering was relatively minor (Dean 1993:3-4). Unintentional damage
by humans was more substantial, and had been caused by touching pictographs, heat and soot from
unauthorized fires, and climbersâ chalk and bolts (Dean 1993:6-8). Intentional vandalism had caused
the greatest damage, including graffiti and attempted theft (Dean 1993:7). Permanent ink marker and
spray painted graffiti caused the most severe damage, because they were highly visible and penetrated
deeply into the rock (Dean 1993:9-14). Dean recommended removing/reintegrating the most recent
and obvious graffiti, beginning with rock imagery site N15D (Puking Horse), N30 (Cave Kiva), and E06
(Comanche Cave) (Dean 1993:24).
55

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

When eight permanent marker inscriptions appeared at rock imagery site N30 (Cave Kiva) in May
1995, TPWD contracted with Dean for their rapid removal, to deter further vandalism. She tested solvents on graffiti-laden samples of rock without pictographs, and determined that methylene chloride
paint stripper would be most effective (Dean 1996:36-37). Dean subcontracted with Wharton & Griswold
Associates of Santa Barbara, California for removal and reintegration of the graffiti. John Griswoldâs in
situ microscopic analysis indicated that the pictograph pigment was cemented to the underlying rock by
natural minerals, and a test application of gel paint stripper did not damage it (Dean 1996:39, 41-42). He
then spent a week removing the graffiti and reintegrating discolored areas with acrylic paint that included
cadmium pigment as a modern marker (Dean 1996:42-43). Griswold also tested spray painted graffiti at
rock imagery site N15D (Puking Horse), and found it to be practically insoluble (Dean 1996:43).
Dean returned to site N15D in July 1996 to reduce the visibility of spray paint that had been applied
at least four years earlier over an area of ca. 10 square m. Based on Griswoldâs tests, she determined
that low pressure air abrasion would be most effective (Dean 1997a:21). A variety of nozzles, abrasive
powders, and pressures were used, as the thickness and condition of the spray paint varied considerably
(Dean 1997a:21-23). The paint could not be removed entirely but was reduced to a shadow; treated
areas were then reintegrated using acrylic paint. Areas where graffiti had been painted directly over the
prehistoric images were not restored (Dean 1997a:22).
In February 1997, Dean assessed the graffiti at site E06 (Comanche Cave) and began restoration
of some areas. The greatest success was achieved by removing charcoal and chalk with a scalpel and
an eraser, while some paint responded to a commercial graffiti removal product. Dean recommended
removal of all graffiti from the cave (Dean 1997b:8-9).
Over 19 days in July and August 1999, Dean returned to Hueco Tanks to remove/reintegrate graffiti at
rock imagery sites W29 (Cave of the Masks) and W13. At W29, chalk and charcoal graffiti were removed
with an eraser and/or brush, and reintegrated using acrylic paint; incised graffiti also were reintegrated
(Dean 2000:66). Deterioration was more severe at rock imagery site W13, where parts of the panels were
endangered by natural exfoliation of the rock, as well as charcoal, chalk, pencil, lipstick, permanent marker,
and incised inscriptions. Graffiti removal was accomplished primarily by scalpel and eraser, followed by
reintegration with acrylic paint. Dean documented the extent of exfoliation, and proposed stabilization of
those areas through grout injection or alternate means (Dean 2000:67-75). She visited other rock imagery
sites and developed a list of priorities for conservation, on advisement of park staff (Dean 2000:78-82).
In March 2001, Dean treated graffiti at 9 rock imagery sites (E01, E06, E17, SE23, SE24, E25, E28,
N32, and W14), and an area on a trail between sites W13 and W14 (Dean 2001). Methods ranged from
eraser to paint stripper, and included reintegration of some areas with acrylic paint. At site E01F, spray
paint that had overlain a yellow pictograph since at least 1972 (Bilbo 1972c:2) proved almost impossible
to remove; Dean proposed use of a laser, which would be differentially absorbed by the dark paint (Dean
2001:7-8). She inspected five sites where graffiti had been removed and/or reintegrated since 1993 and
found them to be relatively stable, although some re-treatment was needed (Dean 2001:29-31).
Dean returned to Hueco Tanks in July 2002 to complete the treatment of rock imagery site W13,
begun in 1999. No exfoliation had occurred since that time. An airbrush was used to remove spray paint
graffiti near panel 13F, and an area near panel 13G where graffiti had been reintegrated in 1999 was
touched up. Examination of previously restored panels found most of them to be stable (Dean 2002).
Dean was called back to site N30 (Cave Kiva) in April 2004, when graffiti reintegration by park staff
in 1981 had become highly visible (Dean 2004:4). The bonding (hydraulic) cement applied by Parker
(1981?) could not be removed, but was reintegrated with acrylic paint. Dean recommended that TPWD
compile a database of all restoration treatments, to guide future work (Dean 2004:9-10, 15).

56

Prehistoric Background

Rock imagery conservation was conducted in July 2006 at sites N18A-E and N19C, where graffiti
had been inscribed and executed in chalk, charcoal, permanent marker, and spray paint (Dean 2006a, b).
Dean removed these materials to the extent possible using standard methods, but recommended against
reintegration. Sandblasting of some areas of N18A-E in the past was reintegrated with a stone consolidant and mineral pigment (Dean 2006a:8, 11). Dean advocated use of a laser to eradicate deep-seated
stains and spray paint that could not be removed by other methods (Dean 2006a:12, 2006b:11-12). Previous restoration work at sites E06 (Comanche Cave), W13D-F, N15D (Puking Horse), N30 (Cave Kiva)
was assessed, and a few recommendations for re-treatment were made (Dean 2006a:15-17).
The most recent rock imagery conservation project took place in August 2008, in response to recent
permanent marker graffiti near a trail. Dean used a combination of alcohol, acetone, and poultices to
remove almost all of the black ink, with minimal bleeding into the surrounding rock. Reintegration was
not needed (Dean 2008).
Survey
Archeological examination of Hueco Tanks began in the 1920s (Roberts 1929), and at least four professional archeologistsâBrand, Sayles, Jackson, and Woolseyâvisited the site in the 1930s (see Early Visits,
above). After a break of almost three decades, the focus returned to archeology in 1963, when archeologist
John Greer made a brief trip to the Tanks during his west Texas ring midden study (Greer 1968:1; personal
communication 2004). He collected ca. 225 ceramic sherds including El Paso Bichrome and Polychrome,
Chupadero Black-on-white, and Playas Red wares, and a few chipped stone artifacts, now curated at TARL.
Based on Greerâs sketch map, these artifacts are from areas currently designated as archeological localities
CA2, CA5, and CA6. (Archeological locality designations are used here to relate previous investigations to
current work, and are defined in the Methods of Archeological Investigations section.)
A few years after Hueco Tanks became a state park, members of the El Paso Archaeological Society
(EPAS) and Anthropology Club of the University of Texas at El Paso inspected areas where facilities
were being built or planned, in conjunction with their rock imagery inventory. In January 1972 they
noted that picnic shelter construction adjacent to North Mountain had not impacted any archeological
deposits, but park superintendent Danny Bedell reported that the foundation of a saloon dating to the
1930s had been destroyed (Bilbo 1972a:1). It is more likely that a structure in that area was related to
the Escontrias Ranch or developments after 1956, however (see Historical Background). Within currently designated locality NE2, the EPAS crew found midden-stained sediments and a dense artifact
scatter and brought them to the attention of TPWD archeologists; excavations were later conducted in
that area, dubbed Hueco Tanks Village (Bilbo 1972a:1-3, 1972c:7; Kegley 1972a:7-8, 1979:19; see below).
Another midden deposit was exposed in an arroyo crossing current localities CA6 and CA7, and two
Folsom points were recovered from the lower part of it (Bilbo 1972a:4).
In February 1972, the volunteers surveyed an area where backhoe trenches had been dug for water/
wastewater lines (Bilbo 1972b:1-2). The team noted some 15 prehistoric rock hearths, debitage, and
âsherds of an extremely hard, fine-textured, dull-luster, yellow potteryâ (Bilbo 1972b:1). One hearth
had been cut by a backhoe trench, and was about 1.5 m long and 15 cm thick. West of the hearths was a
midden estimated to be 15 m long and at least 1 m thick (Bilbo 1972b:2). These areas are encompassed
in current locality ES1.
During 1972, the rock imagery inventory crew noted midden deposits near sites E01, N17, E17,
N19, W21, SE23, SE25, and SE27 (Bilbo 1972a:3, 1972b:3, 1972c:1-2, 7; Toness 1972:3-4), within current

57

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

archeological localities CA1, CA2, CA7, NE1, NE2, NW2, and SB1. Toness (1972:3) also stated that
âCasas Grandes Mexican potsherdsâ were found at rock imagery site W29 (current locality WS2). When
heavy rains in September 1972 exposed numerous artifacts in the south part of the park (Davis 1972a),
EPAS members contacted TPWD archeologist George Kegley to request permission to collect them.
That work was authorized under Texas Antiquities Permit 29, along with the excavations at Hueco Tanks
Village.
Artifacts recovered at Hueco Tanks by EPAS members and others were reviewed in a summary
article by Tom Martin and Frances Sommer (1974). Most notable were Paleoindian points, including
an unprovenienced Folsom point found by P. J. Muhle, the two Folsom points noted by Bilbo (1972a:4),
and Scottsbluff and âunfluted Folsomâ points found by EPAS member Cynthia Martin near rock imagery sites E34 and N38 (Davis and Toness 1974:89, 97; Martin and Sommer 1974:5). The Paleoindian
points were concentrated in or near current archeological localities CA6, CA7, and NE1.
Professional archeological survey at the Tanks resumed in October 1977, when TPWD archeologists
Ron Ralph, Rune Burnett, J. David Ing, and Art Black examined areas proposed for an overflow picnic
area, campground extension, and amphitheater (Ralph 1977; 1996:172-173). The northwest corner of
the park and the west side of East Spur appeared to be the best areas for development, while the interior
basin and the east side of West Mountain were not recommended. To protect midden deposits and rock
imagery throughout the park, Ralph recommended monitoring of all development projects, road construction through placement of fill rather than excavation, and establishment of a 50 to 100 m buffer
between facilities and rock imagery (Ralph 1996:175-176). He asked EPAS member Mike Bilbo to map
midden-stained sediments, rock imagery, packrat middens, water storage devices, and artifacts on largescale TPWD topographic maps (Bilbo 1978; Ralph 1996:173, 176).
Ralph returned to the Tanks in January and August of 1979 to monitor road construction and utility
trench excavation on the north side of North Mountain. Trench walls revealed 10 to 30 cm of soil overlying caliche; although soil thickness reached nearly 1.5 m at the proposed restroom location, no artifacts or midden-stained sediments were found (Ralph 1996:175-176). During inspection of a trail near
North Mountain in October 1979, Ralph discovered that a pedestrian bridge abutment had removed 2
to 3 m of cultural deposits, and noted a midden deposit near the trail. He recommended that clean fill
be brought in to cover the midden and that park staff monitor the area for erosion. Subsequent reports
indicated that the area had been stabilized (Ralph 1996:175-176).
In June 1980, TPWD biologists David Riskind and Raymond Neck assisted Ralph in selecting locations for 25 picnic structures on the northwest side of North Mountain (Ralph 1996:175). To reduce
visitor impact, barriers of brush and cactus were piled at the entrances to rock imagery sites and on
several trails. Stone check dams were built in two small arroyos that were beginning to erode midden
deposits. The team also inspected severe erosion problems in the south part of the park, and recommended that fill be placed in those arroyos as soon as possible (Ralph 1996:175, 177). Two years later,
10 truckloads of limestone boulders were dumped into arroyos at the southeast corner of the park, and
a truckload of smaller stones was used to fill gullies at the south end of West Mountain. Grass seed was
sown on old roadbeds to inhibit gullying (Ralph 1997:106-107). Ralph inspected these areas in April
1984 and reported that the stones were slowing runoff and catching sediment (Ralph 1984).
In September 1985, archeologists surveying the All American Pipeline examined an existing 100 ft
wide pipeline corridor that crosses the southwest corner of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site.
They recorded AAPL Project Number 146-2: a chert core and a ceramic sherd with black and red paint
within an area of 5 square m. These materials were judged to lack discreteness and/or interpretability,
and the area was recorded as an isolated occurrence (Plog et al. 1989:26; TARL files).

58

Prehistoric Background

Almost 10 years passed before the next archeological survey at Hueco Tanks, conducted in May 1995
by TPWD archeologist David Ing. A 9 by 76 m area paralleling an existing road near the park office was
slated for recreational vehicle parking. The area had been disturbed by construction, and no artifacts or
features were found there (Ing 1996).
In the summer/fall of 1995, personnel from Centennial Archaeology, Inc. surveyed an existing 100
ft wide existing pipeline corridor in the northwest corner of the park, where another pipeline was to be
installed (Herder et al. 1996:3, 10). Two ceramic scatters were recorded as Isolated Occurrences 32 and
33, consisting of 12 El Paso Brown and Jornada Brown sherds, and 5 to 9 brownware sherds, respectively
(Herder et al. 1996:192). Isolated occurrence 32 apparently is in current archeological locality NW4. The
proposed pipeline was not built (Herder et al. 1996:1).
In May 1996, a trench for a telephone line on the north boundary of the park hit a gasoline pipeline. David Ing surveyed the area of the spill and did not find any artifacts or features (Ing and Bryan
1996). Archeologist Myles Miller later monitored mechanical removal of contaminated sediment from
the impact area, which measured 10 m north-south by 450 m east-west. Excavations revealed a surface
layer of silty clay that averaged 2 m thick, underlain by carbonate-cemented alluvial gravels to a depth
of at least 6 m. Miller also surveyed a 50 m wide swath south of the trench, the county road north of the
boundary fence, and a 30 m swath north of the road. He found only three lithic artifacts north of the
fence, and no evidence of subsurface cultural deposits. By June 7, only one artifactâa lithic toolâhad
been recovered from the backdirt (Miller 1996a).
Recently, TPWD archeologist Tim Roberts conducted two surveys related to construction of an
interpretive trail (Roberts 2002, 2005a). In 2001, Roberts examined a 457 m-long trail segment that
was to be rerouted along an existing gravel road, running through current archeological locality CA7.
Ground-disturbing impacts were limited to the foundations of two pedestrian bridges that would span
an arroyo. Comparing the modern terrain to a photograph taken by the Kirklands (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:180), it was apparent that the arroyo had formed since 1939. Roberts surveyed the proposed
trail segment and excavated six 3.2 cm diameter soil probes, which hit disturbed sediments. He dug
three 50 by 50 cm test units at the locations where the bridge abutments would be placed, recovering a
mixture of recent materials and prehistoric artifacts; unit profiles indicated that the sediments had been
extensively disturbed. Roberts concluded that no significant archeological deposits would be damaged
by the trail reroute or pedestrian bridge construction (Roberts 2002:98-102).
In 2004, Roberts surveyed two areas on a dam between North and West Mountains that were being
cut down by bulldozers to allow for emergency vehicle access (Roberts 2005a). The dam was comprised
of sediment from an extensive borrow pit to the east, where a prehistoric village reportedly had been
located (Roberts 2005a:65). Screening of substantial quantities of sediment from the bulldozer cuts
produced only recent materials. Examination of the dam surface yielded El Paso Brown, Bichrome, and
Polychrome rim sherds, Chupadero Black-on-white body and rim sherds; body sherds of Playas Red,
Mimbres Boldface, and corrugated wares; chipped and ground stone artifacts; and fire-cracked rocks
(Roberts 2005a:66-67). Roberts also surveyed the margins of the borrow pit, crossing areas currently
designated as localities CA3, CA4, and CA5. He observed artifacts similar to those exposed on the dam,
and collected one obsidian arrow point typed as Harrell. The artifacts from the dam were analyzed and
then returned, because they were from a secondary context. Roberts concluded that at least part of the
sediments comprising the dam represented a Formative (possibly DoÃ±a Ana) occupation that had been
located between the mountains (Roberts 2005a:71-72).

59

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Excavation
In January 1972, members of EPAS and the University of Texas at El Paso Anthropology Club noted
midden-stained sediments covering 1 to 2 acres in an area currently designated as locality NE2, and surmised that they indicated the remains of a pueblo (Bilbo 1972a:1-3, 1972c:7; Kegley 1972a:7-8, 1979:19).
TPWD archeologist George Kegley, assisted by Ron Ralph, conducted excavations in that area in October and November of 1972 and 1973 under Texas Antiquities Permit 29, and recovered evidence of
six structures and four graves dating to the DoÃ±a Ana phase. The findings of these investigations are
reviewed in another section of this report, along with data from subsequent analyses of the collection
(see Hueco Tanks Village section). The rationale and methods of those excavations are outlined here,
along with work conducted in conjunction with that project.
Work at Hueco Tanks Village began in October 1972 on a small rise where a concentration of artifacts on the surface appeared to indicate the most intact part of the site (Kegley 1980a:5). The excavations covered 1,000 square ft (93 square m); most of the units were arrayed in three blocks exposing
Houses 1, 2, and 3. Excavation units ranged from 1 by 2 ft (30 by 61 cm) up to 5 by 5 ft (1.5 by 1.5 m);
matrix was removed in 0.5 ft (15 cm) levels and screened through Â¼ inch hardware cloth. One backhoe
trench measuring 100 ft (31 m) long was dug, along with several shorter trenches (Kegley 1972 field
maps; Kegley 1982:4-5).
Four human burials were found in and near the Village in 1972 (Kegley 1982:21-22). In the late
summer, a park ranger discovered Burial 1 in a small arroyo ca. 100 m from House 1. Burial 2 was
encountered in fill 15 cm above the floor of House 2. On the last day of fieldwork Burial 3 was discovered ca. 30 m from House 1, exposed on the ground surface (Martin and Sommer 1973, 1974:4). It was
later excavated by EPAS members, along with Burial 4, revealed by wind erosion and located 5 m from
Burial 3 (Martin 1973:8-10).
In November of 1972, Kegley conducted test excavations in two areas outside Hueco Tanks Village.
In the southwest part of the park near rock imagery site W36D, five test units were dug in an area that
Kegley designated as 41EP2B (in current locality CA2). Three test pits reached shallow depths and/or
were not screened. Two 5 by 5 ft units were taken to depths of 30 and 36 inches (76 and 91 cm); they
found midden deposits up to 1 m thick, but no features that could be interpreted as structures (Kegley
1972b; Ralph 1978). Kegley also tested an area in the Escontrias ranch complex (current locality NE4),
near the center doorway of the three-room stone ruin. A 10 by 10 ft unit was dug to a depth of 6 inches
(15 cm), and its northwest quadrant was taken down to 12 inches (30 cm). Over 1700 historic artifacts
were recovered.
At the beginning of the 1973 field session at Hueco Tanks Village, the metric system was adopted
for recording vertical and horizontal provenience, using the same site datum. Investigations began with
a magnetometer survey conducted by J. Barto Arnold of the Texas Historical Commission. Readings
were taken at 1 m intervals across a 20 by 20 m grid between and near the structures excavated in 1972
(Arnold 1982:45-46; Arnold and Kegley 1974). Five anomalies were found and tested with 1 by 2 m
units, which hit Houses 4, 5, and 6, an artifact concentration, and an iron stake from the 1972 grid
(Arnold 1982:46-48). A less precise magnetometer search covering a broader area located six anomalies;
three were tested, but no cultural features were found.
The 1973 excavations covered 75 square m; the units were concentrated in three blocks to expose
Houses 4, 5, and 6. Another 11 isolated units were dug to test magnetometer anomalies and other locations
between and around the structures. Matrix was removed in 15 cm levels and screened through Â¼ inch
hardware cloth. Several small backhoe trenches also were excavated (Kegley 1973 field maps; 1982:4-5).

Prehistoric Background

In October 1972, John Davis directed EPAS members who tested cultural deposits in the crevice
that contains rock imagery site W36 (Davis 1972c:2). Inside the cave at the upper end of the crevice,
a reservoir had been created by building a rock dam across a watercourse (Davis 1972c:2, 5-6, Figures
5-6; Kegley 1982:39, Appendix VIII). Ceramic sherds littered the floor. Two mounds of sediment at the
upper end of the cave were tested by 1 ft (30 cm) wide trenches excavated in 6 inch (15 cm) levels. A 7 ft
(2.1 m) trench into the taller mound hit water at a depth of 41 inches (1.04 m), and a 3 ft (1 m) trench
in the low mound struck water at 18 inches (46 cm). Davis suspected that the mounds of sediment had
been dug up to access a natural bedrock basin (Davis 1972c:3-4). The trench excavations yielded El
Paso Polychrome ceramics with thickened and everted rims, Chupadero Black-on-white ceramics, and
a few chipped stone artifacts (Davis 1972c:3-5). Further down the crevice, a crawlway of highly polished
bedrock led to two deep huecos (Davis 1972c:6). After the water was drained from one of them, its fill
yielded many ceramic sherds including El Paso Brownware and Chupadero Black-on-white, along with
whole and fragmentary dart points (John Davis slides; Davis 1972c:5-6).
In October 1973, a test pit was excavated by EPAS members in the rockshelter containing rock imagery site W37E. Davisâ slides indicate that the unit produced ceramic sherds and bone fragments, but no
records or report on this work have been located.
Between 1979 and 1991, four human graves were exposed at various locations in the park and were
excavated. In August 1979, visitors dug around bones in a rock shelter and then alerted park staff when
they appeared to be human; TPWD archeologist George Kegley excavated the burial under Texas Antiquities Permit 212 (Kegley 1980b). In May 1982, a visitor noted human bones in the wall of an arroyo
and in July of that year, human remains were found in an eroding trail; TPWD archeologist Ron Ralph
excavated those graves under Texas Antiquities Permit 297 (Ralph 1997:105). In November 1991, when
a climber found human bones on a sheltered ledge, Ralph and park staff removed them (Ralph 1991).
These graves and those from Hueco Tanks Village are reviewed in the Features, Structures, and Distributions section of this report.

HUECO TANKS VILLAGE

by Margaret Howard

On the recommendation of the El Paso Archaeological Society and the University of Texas at El Paso
Anthropology Club (Bilbo 1972a:1-3; Kegley 1979:19), Texas Parks and Wildlife Department archeologist George Kegley conducted investigations east of North Mountain in Hueco Tanks State Park and
Historic Site during the fall of 1972 and 1973, assisted by Ron Ralph. Their excavations and backhoe
trenching, and a magnetometer survey conducted by J. Barto Arnold, focused almost entirely on a 40 by
50 m area containing a small group of structure remains dating to the DoÃ±a Ana phase (see Prehistoric
Background). Kegley designated this area as 41EP2A and it has since come to be known as Hueco Tanks
Village, although the six structures found there are more accurately characterized as a hamlet. Kegleyâs
excavations fall within current locality NE2.
The original analyses and reports on these investigations (Kegley 1979, 1980a, 1982) were brief, but
the collections were well documented and amenable to further study (Hard et al. 1994:280). Because
this was one of the first DoÃ±a Ana components in the Hueco Bolson to be excavated, analyses of the
collections continued over the following decades, including architectural review (Graves et al. 2001;
Peterson 2001), ceramic typology and rim sherd analyses (Hard et al. 1994; Miller 1996e), botanical
remains identification (DeGarmo 1994; Miller 1997, 2002b), and radiocarbon assays (Miller 1996c,
1996f, 2001a). In this section, Kegleyâs initial findings are reviewed and augmented by the results of later
studies. An interpretive synopsis of the occupation at Hueco Tanks Village concludes the section.

ARCHITECTURE AND VILLAGE PLAN
The remains of six one-room structures were identified in the areas excavated in 1972 and 1973,
and designated as Houses 1 through 6 (Kegley 1980a:10-16). A small area of prepared floor adjoining
the exterior of House 6 might represent another structure and was tentatively labeled House 7, because
House 6 appeared to be superimposed over it (Kegley 1982:18). It also could be the floor of a contiguous
structure (Miller 1989:16). House 5 has two superimposed floors, and the earlier structure may have had
a different orientation (Kegley 1982:16). Built over rectangular pits, five of the structures ranged from
2.3 to 4.1 m on a side, but House 6 measured 5.5 by 4.5 m, encompassing a larger area than the other
structures (Table 2). It may have been a communal structure, similar to single large structures found
at other DoÃ±a Ana phase sites (Miller 2007:3-6; Peterson 2001:119). The interior extent of the Hueco
Tanks Village structures averaged around 12.3 square m, slightly smaller than the regional average for
DoÃ±a Ana phase structures of 14.2 square m (Graves et al. 2001:79, 147).
Houses 1 through 4 were relatively deep, their floors lying 54 to 95 cm below the modern ground
surface, while the floors of Houses 5 and 6 were shallower, encountered from 24 to 31 cm below surface.
Depth at the time of occupation could only be discerned for the floor of House 4, which was 25 cm

below the prehistoric ground surface and 54 cm below the modern ground surface (Kegley 1982:13).
The average depth below surface for these structures is 58.3 cm, somewhat shallower than the regional
average depth for DoÃ±a Ana phase structures of 63.1 cm (Graves et al. 2001:79, 149).
The floors of these one-room structures were dug into the caliche substratum and plastered with
adobe; a second floor was superimposed over the original floor in House 5 (Kegley 1982:8-21), apparently representing renovation of that structure. Adobe plaster also covered the lower walls of five of the
six structures that were excavated (see Table 2). Although no intact walls were found, recovery of fallen
adobe lumps and possible wall remnants in House 1 seemed to indicate that freestanding adobe walls
had been present (Kegley 1982:8).
The roofs of the six structures (with the possible exception of House 2) were supported by two
posts positioned along the midlines of the rooms. Kegley (1982:8) tentatively identified wood from
one post as oak; charcoal samples from four other posts and a beam above the floor of House 7 were
later identified by Tom OâLaughlin as oak, honey mesquite or tornillo, and cottonwood (DeGarmo
1994). The biggest posts were in the largest structure, House 6; holes for those two central posts
measured ca. 50 cm in diameter (Kegley 1982:18), and one of them was identified as oak (DeGarmo
1994). Seventeen smaller postholes were in or near that structure (Kegley 1982:19). Support posts for
the other houses ranged from 9 to 26 cm in maximum dimension (mean = 16.7 cm), based on scale
drawings in the 1982 report. One of the posts in House 2 appeared to have an adobe collar (Kegley
1982:10).
Evidence of room entrances was limited, although it is possible that they were not fully recognized
(Logan McNatt, personal communication 2006). The strongest indication of an entryway was in House
2, where an adobe step was found in the center of the south wall, adjoining an area where the pit wall
could not be discerned (Kegley 1982:10-12). Kegley (1982:7) posited that the adobe step in House 2 also

64

Hueco Tanks Village

could have been an altar or support for a roof ladder, but those explanations seem less likely. In House
4, a semicircular disturbance was found in the center of the south wall in the same position as the step
in House 2 (Kegley 1982:13). In House 6, Kegley (1982:18) found a âpossible entrance in south wall now
eroded beyond positive identification.â
Hearths in the six excavated rooms were positioned midway between the central posts and the south
walls. The hearths in Houses 1 through 4 were surrounded by raised adobe copings or collars. The lower
of two superimposed floors in House 5 had a hearth, while a âmilling binâ (shallow basin containing a
metate and mano) was found on the upper floor (Kegley 1982:14). Other features inside the structures
included an ash lens near the hearth in House 1 and a shallow pit adjacent to the south wall of House
6. The remains of two individuals were found in graves placed in the fill above the southwest corner of
House 2 (see Features, Structures, and Distributions).
Four large, round to amorphous pits were cut through the fill and into the floors of Houses 2, 3,
and 5 (see Table 2), postdating the use of those structures. They had undercut walls, and ranged in size
from 1.2 by 1.5 m (Intrusive Pit #3, fully exposed) up to at least 1.8 by 3 m (Intrusive Pit #2, partially
exposed). Interpreted by Kegley (1982:21) as prehistoric refuse deposits, the pits also could have been
dug many years later by looters. In any case, their fill consisted of refuse deposited after the rooms fell
out of use, containing some of the highest quantities of artifacts and faunal remains at the site, encompassed in ashy gray matrix.
Billy Davidson (1982:75) identified 22 animal taxa in the Hueco Tanks Village collection but did not
report the contexts where they were recovered. Kegley mentioned 9 species that were recovered from
intrusive pits, or in association with the hearth in House 1 (Table 3). Jackrabbit and cottontail rabbit
dominate the Village sample (Kegley 1982:21), as is typical of other DoÃ±a Ana phase components in the
Hueco Bolson (Miller 1989:293-297; Peterson 2001:243). The presence of bison, black bear, softshell
turtle, and desert box turtle remains at Hueco Tanks Village is unusual; these animals were not represented in DoÃ±a Ana components at Gobernadora and Ojasen (Shafer et al. 1999:287-297) or Meyer
Pithouse Village (Peterson 2001:243). Three species represent non-desert habitats; black bears typically
occupy wooded mountainous areas and bison live on open prairies (Davis and Schmidly 1994:227, 290),
while softshell turtles are native to riverine areas (Worthington 1996a:72).
Because excavations at Hueco Tanks Village focused on the six houses (see Prehistoric Background),
the overall layout of the hamlet is poorly known. Fire-cracked rock features and refuse middens typically surround clusters of structures dating to the DoÃ±a Ana phase (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:241242) and could be expected at the Village, where a dense midden deposit was intersected by two test
pits between Houses 4 and 6 (Arnold 1982:48-49). The only other known features outside the houses
are three human graves found outside the pithouse cluster at distances of 16 to 103 m (Kegley 1982:5,
21-22).
The quantity of refuse deposited in Houses 1 through 6 suggests that additional structures might be
present between and around them (Mauldin 1986:265; Myles Miller, personal communication 2008).
That said, the cluster of freestanding adobe rooms at the Village is equivalent in size (approximately 32
by 45 m) to the pithouse cluster at Gobernadora (Miller 1989:187) but considerably larger than the pithouse cluster at Meyer Pithouse Village (12 by 32 m; Scarborough 1989:87). The houses at Hueco Tanks
Village are aligned similarly, with walls and roof support posts oriented east-west (Figure 10). At least
three of the rooms may have had south entrances (see above). This orientation is typical of almost all the
rectangular structures in the region (Miller et al. 2009:14-41), and would have provided illumination
throughout the day and heat in winter (Bentley 1992b:37).

ARTIFACTS
Reporting on the artifact sample from the 1972-1973 excavations was limited; the artifact table in
the 1982 report (Kegley 1982:6) included typographical errors and other inconsistencies, and the column headings were missing. The table designated as Figure 19 in the 1980 report is reproduced here
with subtotals and other annotations (Table 4). Several artifact classes described in the 1980 report are
not included on Table 4, the largest being ca. 24,126 pieces of debitage, 35 percent (n = 8,444) of which
were analyzed (Kegley 1982:70-74). Three additional artifacts are not included in Table 4: a Group L
(Folsom) projectile point, a gouge, and a boat-shaped object (Kegley 1982:25-26, 28-29, 38). A recent
inventory of the Hueco Tanks Village collection (see Methods of Archeological Investigations) indicates
that counts in the 1980 report are somewhat low, but are proportionately representative of the collection. When the missing items are combined with the 1980 totals, the ratio of ceramic to chipped stone
artifacts in the sample is 1.4 to 1 (not 2:1 as calculated by Peterson (2001:232)). Mauldin (1986:265-266)
has proposed that the ratio of ca. 60 [58] percent ceramics to 40 [42] percent chipped stone at Hueco
Tanks Village indicates that it is a primary residential site where agriculture was the major activity.

The majority of the 58,122 artifacts collected from Hueco Tanks Village are ceramic sherds (n = 33,816,
58 percent). El Paso brownware accounts for 95 percent of the pottery. Characterized generally as El Paso
Polychrome by Kegley (1979:20, 1980a:Figure 19), it includes El Paso Brown, Bichrome, and Polychrome
(Kegley 1982:32, 53). Originally, Rogers (1982:55-56, 61) distinguished painted and unpainted El Paso
Brownware in a random sample of 274 of the 969 rim sherds: 16 percent (n = 43) were unpainted, 16
percent (n = 45) had red or black paint, and 68 percent (n = 186) had black and red paint. Later analysis

Hueco Tanks Village

of 447 El Paso brownware rim sherds from Hueco Tanks Village by Hard et al. (1994:271-272, 275-276)
also found relatively even proportions of El Paso Brown (n = 92, 21 percent) and Bichrome (n = 118,
26 percent), and over 50 percent El Paso Polychrome (n = 237, 53 percent). The vessels represented by
those rim sherds had a mean diameter of 20 cm, and were judged to be 51 percent jars, 30 percent bowls,
9 percent tecomates (neckless jars), and 10 percent unknown forms (Hard et al. 1994:272). The mean
rim sherd index for 370 measurable El Paso brownware specimens was 1.09, with Brown rims at 0.97
(tapered), Bichrome at 1.06 (direct), and Polychrome at 1.12 (thickened; Hard et al. 1994:272). Calculating rim sherd indices for this sample by a slightly different method, Miller (1996e:77-79) found that the
El Paso Brown rims are considerably tapered, and appear to represent an occupation predating A.D. 1000.
The 1,533 nonlocal sherds make up 5 percent of the ceramic sample, and Chupadero Black-onwhite comprises 83 per cent of them (Kegley 1982:6, 35). Second in abundance is Playas Red (8 per
cent); the remaining nonlocal ceramics are (in decreasing order) Mimbres Black-on-white, untyped
corrugated, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, Wingate Black-on-red, Ramos Polychrome, and St. Johns
Polychrome (see Table 4). Chihuahuan ceramics are present in higher numbers than reported by Kegley and include Villa Ahumada Polychrome, as noted in subsequent analyses (Myles Miller, personal
communication 2008) and a recent inventory. Kegleyâs and Hardâs counts differ slightly for Wingate
Black-on-red (Kegley 6, Hard 5), St. Johns Polychrome (Kegley 3, Hard 4), and Mimbres Black-on-white
(Kegley 58, Hard 59) (Hard et al. 1994:270-271; Kegley 1980a:Figure 19). Variation in counts for Wingate/St. Johns Black-on-red/Polychrome is not surprising, as these types are distinguished by slip color
and presence/absence of white paint, attributes not always evident on small sherds (Carlson 1970:1141). Hard et al. (1994:270) further identified 37 of the Mimbres sherds as Style II (n = 2), Style II/III (n =
10), or Style III (n = 25; Scott 1983:45-67). Source analyses and relative abundance (see Materials Recovered) suggest that the nonlocal ceramics originated in south-central New Mexico (Chupadero Blackon-white and Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta), southwest New Mexico (Mimbres Black-on-white, some
Playas Red), west central New Mexico (Wingate Black-on-red and St. Johns Polychrome), and northern
Mexico (Ramos Polychrome and some Playas Red).
Projectile points from Hueco Tanks Village consist primarily of arrow points (n = 55, 73 percent),
with 19 dart points and 1 lanceolate point (Kegley 1982:6, 23-26). Over one-third of the points were
found in association with structure floors (see Table 4). The quantity of projectile points is unusually
high, and more typical of Formative sites in mountainous areas than lowland sites (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:255). Based on stem form (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:225-226, 229, 232; Roney 1985:22),
11 of the dart points date to the Late Archaic period and 8 to the Middle Archaic period (see Table 4).
These specimens probably were scavenged from earlier occupations in the vicinity and recycled by Village occupants (Miller 1996e:73). The lanceolate point is typed as Folsom, but was discovered on a backdirt pile under suspicious circumstances (Hueco Tanks Village artifact catalog; Logan McNatt, personal
communication 2008); Folsom points have been found in this part of the park, however.
Other chipped stone tools are 17 scrapers, 20 bifaces, 12 drills, 1 spokeshave, 1 burin, and 1 gouge
(see Table 4; Kegley 1982:26-28). The diversity of formal tools at Hueco Tanks Village indicates an
emphasis on formal tool production, in contrast to Gobernadora which also is located in an area with
abundant raw materials but has very few formal tools (Miller 1989:222). Debitage (n = ca. 24,126)
comprises 99 percent of the Hueco Tanks Village chipped stone artifact sample and 88 percent of the
Gobernadora sample (Miller 1989:151), although flake tools were not identified at Hueco Tanks Village
and could account for part of this difference. The 8,444 complete flakes and proximal flake fragments
from the Village are mostly small, lack cortex, and have multifaceted platforms, suggesting to Clark
(1982:70, 72) that biface thinning was the primary reduction technology and that the initial stages of
reduction took place elsewhere. Over 97 percent of the flakes are made of chert; limestone represents less

69

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

than 2 per cent and obsidian less than 1 per cent (Clark 1982:72). In conjunction with the diverse faunal
remains, the quantity and variety of bifacial tools at Hueco Tanks Village indicate that hunting played a
significant role in the subsistence economy (Miller 1989:17).
Other artifacts recovered in 1972 and 1973 are 47 ground stone tools, 4 shell ornaments, 1 bone
awl, and 1 âboat-shaped objectâ (Kegley 1982:28-31). The 32 manos are made of limestone, sandstone,
and porphyritic syenite, and are described by Kegley (1982:30) as the type which fit comfortably in one
hand. Measurement of the eight complete manos found during the recent inventory determined that
none of them exceed 13.5 cm in length. Using mano length as a proxy for agricultural dependence,
Hard, Mauldin, and Raymond (1996:260-264) consider manos less than 15 cm long to indicate relatively low use of corn. Among the 15 metates, all but two are fragmentary; 10 appear to be from slab
(flat) metates and 5 from basin metates. Thirteen are made of porphyritic syenite from Hueco Tanks,
and two of limestone. Striations on the complete slab metate found on the floor of House 6 indicate that
grinding was performed in a variety of directions (Kegley 1982:28-31).
Two shell ornaments were found on the floors of Houses 1 and 5, and two others were in intrusive
pits or other contexts (see Table 4). The Olivella sp. marine shells lack spires and are beads; Olivella species are native to the Gulf of California and Pacific coast, so the shells or finished beads were obtained
through trade (Lowry 2005:203; Southward 1979:102). The disk bead and small pendant are made of
shell that cannot be identified to species, but could be freshwater mussel, the closest source of which is
the Rio Grande. The awl is a sharpened splinter of deer long bone. The boat-shaped object initially was
thought to be fired clay (Kegley 1982:29, 38); recent examination indicates that it is a small limestone
fragment ground into triangular form and engraved with an X on both faces. It was recovered from
Intrusive Pit 2 in House 3 (Hueco Tanks Village artifact catalog).
Twenty-two possible ritual items not noted in Kegleyâs report were found during the recent inventory of the Hueco Tanks Village collection: eight fossils, seven nonlocal rocks, six possible pigment
stones, and one stone bead. Seven of them were recovered from test units in the area between the houses,
consisting of three brachiopods, two crinoid columnals, one gastropod fossil, and one quartz crystal.
The other 15 items were associated with structures. Fill from House 1 yielded two hematite fragments.
House 2 fill contained four pieces of turquoise and two quartz or fused sand fragments. Fill from House
3 produced a piece of limonite. A smoothed hematite fragment with striations was recovered 5 cm above
the floor of House 4. House 5 produced a crinoid columnal from fill. House 6 yielded a stone bead, limonite and striated hematite pieces in association with the floor, and a crinoid columnal from fill. While
the fossils and quartz could have been obtained nearby, the closest sources of turquoise and pigment
are in the Organ and Jarilla Mountains (Beckes et al. 1977:76; Carmichael 1986:232; Miller and Graves
2009:405-406; Schmidt and Craddock 1964:44).
Houses 2 and 6 produced the greatest number of possible ritual items, yielding six and four specimens respectively. The association of three of the four items in House 6 with the floor provides some
support for its use as a communal structure (Miller 2007:3-7; Peterson 2001:119). Overall, possible
ritual artifacts were relatively rare at Hueco Tanks Village, and were scattered widely; no ritual deposits
were identified.

PLANT REMAINS
Matrix samples from several contexts in House 2 and macrobotanical specimens from all of the
structures except House 5 were collected during the 1972-1973 excavations at Hueco Tanks Village. They

70

Hueco Tanks Village

were not analyzed until 1993, when archeologists under contract to Fort Bliss obtained the samples,
artifacts, and notes from the Hueco Tanks Village investigations to restudy aspects of them for the Fort
Bliss Chronometric and Relative Chronology Project (Miller 1996b-f). The matrix bags were breaking
and some of their contents had molded, so those samples were processed through flotation (DeGarmo
1994; Myles Miller, personal communication 2002). Tom OâLaughlin identified the plant remains
recovered from the matrix samples, and most of the macrobotanical samples (Table 5).
Although botanical samples collected through excavation and flotation are not directly comparable
(OâLaughlin 2001:248-249), the relative abundance and context of the identified plant specimens from
Hueco Tanks Village can be interpreted generally. Wood used for construction and fuel makes up the
majority of the botanical remains; charcoal comprises 96 percent of the sample by weight (see Table
5). Around one-third is honey mesquite or tornillo (Prosopis sp.), and another third is creosotebush
(Larrea sp.). Cottonwood (Populus) also is well represented at 23 percent, and there are minor quantities of charcoal from oak (Quercus sp.), silktassel (Garrya sp.), saltbush (Atriplex sp.), and hackberry
(Celtis sp.). The largest individual samples probably are from support posts or beams, identified as cottonwood, creosotebush, oak, and honey mesquite or tornillo (DeGarmo 1994). The small amounts of
charcoal from silktassel, saltbush, and hackberry indicate that they were used primarily as fuel, although
the latter two species have edible fruits and leaves not represented in the sample.
The rest of the botanical remains represent edible parts of plants. Wild plant foods probably comprised the bulk of the vegetal diet during the DoÃ±a Ana phase (Hard, Mauldin, and Raymond 1996:298),
and are represented at the Village by seeds from cactus (including Opuntia sp.), pigweed or goosefoot
(Cheno-Am), and datil yucca (Yucca baccata), most from House 2 flotation samples (see Table 5). Cactus and yucca seeds typically are byproducts of processing fruits, while the pigweed/goosefoot seeds
could represent consumption of greens and seeds, or incidental burning (OâLaughlin 2001:255, 259260). Another wild plant that probably was consumed is agave, but remains of this plant rarely have
been found on archeological sites in the region, even in stone-lined pits where it is thought to have been
processed (OâLaughlin 2001:265).
Cultivated plants are indicated by four corn (Zea mays) kernels and one common bean (Phaseolus
vulgaris), found in the fill above the House 2 floor, an intrusive pit in House 2, the east posthole fill in
House 3, and a test excavation north of House 6. These widespread contexts suggest that cultivated
plants were common at Hueco Tanks Village. Miller (1997) calculated a maize ubiquity of 60 percent,
finding corn in three of five flotation samples (totals differ somewhat from the data in DeGarmo 1994).
Also, two corn cobs from a packrat midden in the rock hills 730 m south-southwest of the Village have
been dated to the DoÃ±a Ana phase via radiocarbon assay (see Appendix B), supporting the presence of
corn fields at the Tanks during this period.
Other lines of evidence suggest that domesticated plants, particularly corn, were cultivated by the
occupants of Hueco Tanks Village. The site is positioned between two areas of Mimbres deep silt loam
(see Figure 6), which has a higher water-holding potential than other soils in the vicinity (see Environmental Background). The flow of water downslope on the alluvial fan is impeded by the rock hills that
border these areas on the west, trapping subsurface soil moisture. These areas currently are inundated
during heavy rains, and the area north of the Village was enclosed by an earthen dam by 1916 (see Features, Structures, and Distributions). Areas like these that are inundated by sheet floods are favorable
for agriculture because water evenly wets the entire surface, obviating the need for water diversion or
irrigation (Field 1992).
Although there is no evidence that water was diverted from natural cracks and ponds in the rock
hills to irrigate fields in this area, pot irrigation (Doolittle 2000:309-310; Kenmotsu et al. 2008:6-14)

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Hueco Tanks Village

could have been practiced. Prehistoric dams built at four locations on the rock hills overlooking Hueco
Tanks Village and in a canyon 540 m from it impounded seasonal rainfall that could have been used for
a variety of purposes (see Features, Structures, and Distributions section). Abundant Jornada style rock
imagery on the lower elevations of the rock hills is generally contemporaneous with Hueco Tanks Village, and is believed to represent petitions to obtain rain for successful crops (see Rock Imagery).
The substantial effort required to construct and maintain the structures in Hueco Tanks Village
also may indicate that people lived there for a considerable part of the year while they tended cultivated
crops, a prerequisite for obtaining even modest yields (Wills 1988:39-41). Storage of bulk crop resources
also would have tethered Village residents to this location (Wills 1988:47). Despite the minor contribution of corn and other domesticated plants to the diet of Village occupants, the ability to store these
foods for later use could have been sufficient incentive to adopt their cultivation (Wills 1988:143) and
occupy a nearby settlement during a good part of the year.

CHRONOLOGY
Information on the absolute age of Hueco Tanks Village has increased exponentially since Kegley
obtained the first radiocarbon date on wood from the west posthole of House 1 (Kegley 1979:21). As
part of the Fort Bliss Chronometric and Relative Chronology Project (DeGarmo 1994; Miller 1996b-f),
19 radiometric assays were run on identified botanical remains from the Village (DeGarmo 1994; Miller
1996f). In addition, 32 obsidian artifacts were submitted for intrinsic water content obsidian hydration
analysis, calibrated relative to temperature monitoring stations at the Tanks (Miller 1996d:111-125, 129,
Miller 1996f), but the method proved to be imprecise and those findings are not considered here.
The radiocarbon samples (Table 6) were selected based on their association with two target events:
room construction and renovation (posts) and room use (hearths, floors, and fill near floors). Four
are single-year growth specimens (bean, corn, and yucca seeds) from edible plants that probably were
consumed by village residents, and should date those occupations with a fair degree of precision (Miller
2001a:157). Representing all of the structures except House 5 and possible House 7, the 20 radiocarbon
dates from Hueco Tanks Village allow for a comprehensive understanding of its span of occupation.
Miller (2001a) reviewed the 20 radiocarbon assays for Hueco Tanks Village in the course of assessing the age of Meyer Pithouse Village relative to other DoÃ±a Ana phase sites. He determined that the
Hueco Tanks occupation fell almost entirely between A.D. 1000 to 1300, encompassing the DoÃ±a Ana
phase as currently defined (Miller 2005b:74). A summed radiocarbon probability histogram for the site
peaks between A.D. 1200 and 1300, placing the primary occupation span in the late DoÃ±a Ana phase
(Miller 2001a:156). Less than 10 percent of the cumulative calibrated radiocarbon age probability distribution for Hueco Tanks Village fell before A.D. 1000, and only 30 percent predated A.D. 1150 (Miller
2001a:156).
The nonlocal ceramic sample from Hueco Tanks Village (see Table 4) provides another means of
evaluating the length of its occupation. Although it is dominated by long-lived Chupadero Black-onwhite sherds (83 percent), most of the remaining ceramic types were produced during relatively limited
periods of time within the DoÃ±a Ana phase (A.D. 1000 to 1300). Four nonlocal ceramic types or styles are
bracketed almost entirely by the DoÃ±a Ana phase: Mimbres Black-on-white Style III (A.D. 1010 to 1130;
Shafer and Brewington 1995:7), Wingate Black-on-red (A.D. 1050 to 1200; Carlson 1970:17), Three
Rivers Red-on-terracotta (A.D. 1150 into the early 1300s; Miller and Graves 2009:255; Stewart 1983:45),
and St. Johns Polychrome (A.D. 1175 to 1300; Carlson 1970:39). Thirteen Mimbres Blackâonâwhite

sherds predate A.D. 1000 almost entirely (Shafer and Brewington 1995:7), identified as Style I (A.D. 750
to 900; see Materials Recovered), Style II (A.D. 880 to 1020), or Style II/III (A.D. 970 to 1020; Hard et al.
1994:270). Three types have date ranges that extend after A.D. 1300: Chupadero Black-on-white (A.D.
1050 to 1500s; Clark 2006:67-68; Miller and Graves 2009:255-256), Playas Red (A.D. 1200 to early 1500s;
Dean and Ravesloot 1993:97-98; Miller 1995:217), and Ramos Polychrome (A.D. 1200 to 1500; Rinaldo
and Fenner 1974:251; Dean and Ravesloot 1993:97-98).
Individual radiocarbon assays shed light on the timing of occupations within the Village, and use
and abandonment of the structures (e.g., Miller and Burt 2007:4-8 through 4-11). The dated structuresâHouses 1 through 4 and 6âwere occupied between A.D. 1000 and 1300, and are generally contemporaneous; the corn, bean, and yucca seeds also fall squarely within this 300-year span (see Table 6).
This period encompasses around 10 generations, however, and multiple occupations certainly occurred.
Relatively intensive and/or long-lived use is indicated by the high artifact densities in the refuse deposits
that typically fill structures dating to this phase, including Hueco Tanks Village (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:242). The superimposed floor levels in House 5 clearly evidence reoccupation, but unfortunately
are not dated because no botanical remains were recovered from that structure (DeGarmo 1994).
If the structures were occupied repeatedly during the 300-year span of the Hueco Tanks Village occupation, their roof supports would have needed to be refurbished periodically. Post replacement may be
indicated in Houses 1 and 6 by dates on charcoal from diverse woody plants species recovered from postholes (see Tables 5 and 6). Fill from the west posthole in House 1 yielded oak and ephedra charcoal dating
between A.D. 1040 and 1300, and potentially later creosotebush charcoal dating between 1220 and 1410.
In House 6, oak charcoal from the base of the west posthole dated between A.D. 730 and 1150, while possibly later silktassel from the base of that posthole dated between A.D. 1020 and 1280. In contrast, dates
obtained from the east posthole of House 3 on two samples of creosotebush charcoal recovered between 38
and 50 cm and 50 to 57 cm appear to be incorrectly superimposed (see Table 6), but have almost identical
time spans (A.D. 1010 to 1280 and A.D. 1020 to 1250), suggesting that they are from the same post.
Although ceramics found on the floors of structures in the Village would provide another means of
estimating the spans of use of the rooms, those associations were not recorded in 1972 and 1973. The
1,368 sherds that were recovered in 15 cm levels immediately overlying structure floors were considered
by Kegley (1982:8) to be associated with those floors (see Table 4). Floor-proximate samples from the six
houses (Table 7) are dominated by El Paso Polychrome (as characterized by Kegley, actually brownware)
which includes El Paso Brown, Bichrome, and Polychrome (Kegley 1982:32, 53). Identification of these
1,333 sherds to type would provide better information on the timing and contemporaneity of house
occupations, but was not feasible during the current investigations. Similarly, styles of the few Mimbres
Black-on-white sherds in the floor-proximate samples have not been determined, though their limitation to Houses 4, 5, and 6 suggests that these were the earliest structures built in the Village. Evidence for
use through the end of the DoÃ±a Ana phase and possibly later was found in all six structures in the form
of Chupadero Black-on-white and/or Ramos Polychrome ceramics; a slightly greater representation of
Chupadero in House 2 may indicate that it was one of the last rooms to be abandoned.
In sum, limited evidence was recovered of a Mesilla phase occupation in this area prior to construction
of the freestanding one-room adobe structures that comprise Hueco Tanks Village. Ceramics predating
A.D. 1000 include ca. 92 El Paso Brown tapered rim sherds (Miller 1996e:77-79), 1 Mimbres Black-onwhite Style I sherd (A.D. 750 to 900), 2 Style II sherds (A.D. 880 to 1020) and 10 Style II/III sherds (A.D.
970 to 1020; Hard et al. 1994:270; Shafer and Brewington 1995:7). One radiocarbon assay also seems
to predate the Village occupation; saltbush charcoal from the west posthole of House 1 yielded a date
between A.D. 690 and 1020 (see Table 6). These few specimens probably were incorporated into the
later Village assemblage by excavation of postholes and other pits, trampling, and other non-intentional

means. The primary period of occupation of Hueco Tanks Village occurred during the DoÃ±a Ana phase
(A.D. 1000 to 1300), and summed probabilities of the 20 radiocarbon dates indicate greater intensity of
occupation in the late part of that phase, between A.D. 1150 and 1300.

SUMMARY
The 1972-1973 excavations at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site found the remains of six
one-room structures comprising a hamlet, located a short distance from the rock hills. Five free-standing rooms were arrayed in a rough line across the north part of the village, with one larger structure
located around 15 m to the south. The structures were rectangular; the smaller ones ranged from 2 to 4
m on a side, and the large one was around 5 m square.
The rooms were partially set into pits, possibly to reduce the amount of building material that had
to be used. Earth-sheltered rooms also would have offered greater protection from heat, cold, and wind.
Most of the small rooms were in pits dug from ca. 70 cm to almost 1 m below surface. The large structure and one of the small rooms were shallower; their floors were only 25 to 30 cm below surface. All of
the house floors were dug down into a caliche layer that lay below the sandy soil, and then the pits were
plastered with adobe. One small room had two levels of plastered floors, indicating that sandy soil had
accumulated for some time before the new floor was installed.
Above the house pits were low walls made of puddled adobe. Two wooden posts lined up in the
center of the rooms probably supported sloping roofs built on a wooden framework covered with sticks.
The posts of the small rooms averaged around 17 cm in diameter, while the posts for the large structure
were around 50 cm thick. Mesquite, cottonwood, and creosotebush were used for posts, and the largest ones were made of oak. The many types and sizes of these posts are evidence of the abundance and
variety of trees at Hueco Tanks.
The structures appear to have been constructed according to a common plan, with two walls and
their roof ridges oriented east-west. Entrances were on the south-facing walls of the structures, and at
least one small room probably had an entry corridor that sloped down from the surface with an adobe
step at the threshold of the room.
76

Hueco Tanks Village

Inside the structures were small hearths, positioned midway between the roof posts and the south
walls. Wood for fuel was readily available at the Tanks, and mostly consisted of mesquite, creosotebush,
and cottonwood. Some houses had food grinding bins and small pits that were used for storage. When
structures were not occupied, they were used for refuse disposal by persons living in the remaining
houses. Two people were laid to rest in the refuse midden that built up in the corner of an abandoned
room, following a traditional native practice in the American Southwest. Others were buried in pits dug
near the structures, but one grave was located around 100 m away from the village.
The occupants of Hueco Tanks Village hunted animals and gathered wild plants to obtain most of
their diet, supplemented by small-scale corn and bean cultivation. Their high reliance on game animals
was more typical of groups living in mountainous areas than on the edge of the desert. It was made
possible by the many animals that were attracted to the water sources at the Tanks. Animal bones indicate that desert-dwelling species, particularly rabbits, were the mainstay of the meat diet. A few bones
represent black bear, which typically occupies mountainous areas, prairie-dwelling bison, and softshell
turtles from rivers. While Village occupants might have traveled widely to hunt these animals, it also is
possible that the Tanks provided a hospitable environment for all of them.
The majority of vegetables in the diet were wild plants, including cactus, yucca fruits, and pigweed/
goosefoot greens and/or seeds. Agave probably was a staple plant food, processed in rock ovens outside
the cluster of houses. Corn and beans were cultivated in fields in patches of moist soil located near the
village. At least a few occupants stayed at the Village for most of the year, to tend the fields and watch
over the seeds stored for the next yearâs crop. When rainfall was sparse, they may have nurtured individual plants by hauling water in pots from areas in the hills where they had built rock dams to retain
seasonal rainfall. Plant foods were ground on rock slabs obtained from the nearby hills, using small,
hand-sized stones. At least some food grinding was done indoors, likely to prevent the meal from being
lost to high winds.
Chipped stone tools were made from chert that was commonly available in the limestone mountain
range to the east and outlying limestone hills to the west. Tools were roughed out at the locations where
the stone was quarried and returned to the Village for final shaping. The number of chipped stone tools
that were made and used at the Village was greater than average, due to the abundant raw material and
the need to chip arrows for hunting, knives for butchering and agave harvesting, scrapers for hide preparation, drills for woodworking, and other tools.
Cooking and eating vessels were made from clay that may have been obtained around igneous hills
like Cerro Alto to the east, shaped by hand from coils and hardened over open campfires. Most pots were
open jars, with a smaller number of bowls and other types of vessels. Around half were decorated with
black and red designs, one-fourth had black or red paint, and the remainder were unpainted. A few pots
were imported, most from what is now central and western New Mexico; others came from northern
Mexico, all obtained through a trade network that extended across the region. Most of the imported
pots were narrow-necked jars from central New Mexico that were harder than the local pottery and had
distinctive black and white decorations.
A few pieces of shell jewelry were worn and eventually lost in the houses or other areas of the village.
Some of the shells they were made of were imported through the regional trade network from areas as
far away as the Pacific coast. A few unworked fragments of turquoise from mountains well to the north
were obtained through the regional trade network.
People probably did not live at Hueco Tanks Village constantly, but as many as 10 generations
returned to these rooms for some 300 years. They were drawn by the plentiful game, agave and other
wild plant foods, damp soils where plants could be grown, rock slabs for grinding tools, nearby sources

77

of stones suitable for chipping, and house structures that could be reoccupied. The scenic rock hills that
bordered the village were landmarks on the slope below the mountain range to the east, providing protection from the prevailing west winds and a seasonal water supply, and offering sheltered areas where
village inhabitants drew images to petition higher powers for rainfall so that they could continue to tend
their fields in the shadow of Hueco Tanks.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

by Terri Myers and Margaret Howard

This section is based primarily on a history of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site compiled
by Terri Myers of HardyÂ·HeckÂ·Moore & Associates, Inc. (Myers 1997); Margaret Howard has augmented
that account with information on Native Americans and other visitors to Hueco Tanks. After a summary of research methods, the section opens with a review of the early historic occupation of the El Paso
valley. Next come accounts of travelers on the trail that passed through Hueco Tanks, beginning with
Spanish explorers and followed by historic Native Americans, forty-niners, military personnel, stage
travelers, and Texas Rangers. The ranching history of the Tanks follows, focusing on the Escontrias family who raised cattle and horses there from the 1890s to the 1950s. Recent history includes attempts to
promote Hueco Tanks through recreational developments as early as 1956. The section concludes with
an account of how Hueco Tanks came into the public domain, beginning when it was acquired by the
county in 1965 and continuing as a state park since 1969.

RESEARCH METHODS
Research by Terri Myers was conducted in the spring of 1995, and began at the headquarters of
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site. Interviews with Superintendent Ray Sierra and Ranger Alex
Mares provided a general understanding of the history of the park. Sierra allowed access to files held at
the site, which contained secondary source materials and recent articles.
Research also was conducted in the Special Collections Department of the Library at the University
of Texas at El Paso, which holds rare copies of watercolor and line drawings made by Russell Bartlett in
1850-1853, including two drawings of the Hueco Tanks vicinity. Vertical files and newspaper clippings
in the Southwest Room of the El Paso Public Library yielded information on development schemes in
the 1950s and 1960s, and acquisition of the park by the county and state.
In Austin, historians from HardyÂ·HeckÂ·Moore & Associates, Inc. obtained information on Hueco
Tanks State Park and Historic Site from files at the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Center for
American History at The University of Texas at Austin, the Texas State Library and Archives Commission, the Texas Natural Resources Information System, and the Texas General Land Office. One of the
most important primary sources was the original Silverio Escontrias patent, held at the General Land
Office. At the Texas Historical Commission, marker files for Hueco Tanks, the Butterfield Overland
Stage, and other El Paso County historic sites were reviewed.
Information on the Escontrias and Armendariz families was obtained from a variety of sources.
Myers interviewed Daniel Escontrias (grandson of original patentee Silverio Escontrias), contacted Silverioâs son Charlie, and conducted an extensive interview with Silverioâs grandnephew Joe Ledesma,
whose father and grandfather had been caretakers at the ranch. These interviews were transcribed and
79

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

reviewed by Ada Gonzalez-Peterson. Information on dams and tanks at the park was obtained by Alex
Mares in August 1996, by means of a videotaped interview with Mary and Juan Ernesto Escontrias
(grandson of Silverio Escontrias). The historical context of the Escontrias ranch was established during
archeological and architectural investigations of the lower El Paso valley conducted between 1992 and
1995 by Archeological Research, Inc. and HardyÂ·HeckÂ·Moore & Associates, Inc., which shed light on
the relationship between the Armendariz and Escontrias families, and their contributions to the lower
valley community. Census records on file at the Texas State Library and Archives Commission and newspaper obituaries yielded supplementary information on these families.
Difficulties in obtaining and deciphering early deed, census, and other legal records for the El Paso
region should be noted. After the Mexican War, division of valley communities into two nations by the
international boundary commission created land ownership conflicts. Property on the north side of the
border was often seized and granted to Americans, and the chains of title were at times intentionally
obscured. When El Paso County was formed in 1850, many legal records had to be copied from originals held in Mexico, and some were lost. Determination of property ownership for the period before
the county was reorganized in 1870 involves interpreting Mexican records for both sides of the Rio
Grande, and is at times unclear. In contrast, the post-1870 ownership of the tracts that now comprise
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site is well documented in Texas General Land Office records, and
through chain of title research conducted in El Paso by Stewart Title (Reza 1991).

ABOVE THE EL PASO VALLEY, 1581-1850s
Carved by the Rio Grande, the El Paso valley is a verdant alluvial plain ranging from 2 to 6 miles
wide, in an otherwise arid expanse of Chihuahuan desert (Morrow 1981:5). Upstream from the city of
El Paso the valley is known as the upper or Mesilla valley, named for the town of Mesilla, New Mexico.
The valley below El Paso stretches some 30 miles southeast to the town of Fabens, and is known as the
lower valley. On the desert plain above the lower valley lies Hueco Tanks, located approximately 23 miles
from the Rio Grande.
El Pasoâs recorded history began in the sixteenth century with Spanish exploration of what is now
Texas and New Mexico. Chronicler HernÃ¡n Gallegos wrote the first known description of the El Paso
valley in the summer of 1581. Juan de OÃ±ate passed through the lower valley in 1598 and led the first
group of Spanish colonists through âEl Paso del RÃ­o del Norte,â where they encountered the Manso
Indians who lived in the surrounding area (Gerald 1974c:117). The gorge that the Rio Grande had cut
through the Franklin Mountains soon became a major pathway for explorers, missionaries, and settlers
from central Mexico, heading north into what is now New Mexico (Timmons 1990).
In the Paso del Norte valley, the first permanent Spanish colonial settlement was initiated in 1659,
when pioneer Franciscan missionary Father GarcÃ­a de San Francisco established the mission of Nuestra SeÃ±ora de Guadalupe de los Mansos on the south side of the Rio Grande in Paso del Norte (now
Ciudad JuÃ¡rez; Beckett and Corbett 1992:5). Additional native groups had entered the mission by 1668,
when the names of Piro, Jumano, Suma, and Tano Indians first appeared on baptismal records (Gerald
1974c:120-121).
During the early period of Spanish exploration and settlement, the pass was an outpost between
the northern colonies and interior Mexico. In August and September 1680, many of the native pueblo
dwellers of present New Mexico united to expel the Spanish intruders, in what is known as the Pueblo
Revolt. More than 2,000 Spanish soldiers, settlers, and missionariesâalong with about 200 Tigua and

80

Historical Background

Piro Indiansâabandoned their settlements and fled south along the Rio Grande to Paso del Norte
(Fewkes 1902:57-60; Houser 1979:338-339; Timmons 1990). By 1682 the Spanish had established missions on the river at the pueblo of Ysleta for the Tiguas, and at Socorro for the Piros. The presidio of
San Elceario was established in 1789 at or near the Ortega ranch (Morrow 1989b:25). These three lower
valley settlements are some of the oldest permanent communities in Texas (Hamilton 1996).
Spanish troops stopped by Hueco Tanks in 1692, as part of the campaign of Captain General Diego
de Vargas to reclaim lost territory in present New Mexico. De Vargas had established a temporary base
of operations at Paso del Norte in February 1691; from there, he planned to launch an expedition into
the disputed territory. In March 1692 he directed a group of some 80 persons on a reconnaissance from
Socorro to the Sierra Negra [present Guadalupe Mountains], guided by an Apache captive; his aim was
to locate valuable salt deposits and water sources known to the Apaches who inhabited that area (Austerman 1991:28; Bailey 1940:19; Broaddus 1976b:5-6; Forbes 1994:233). Although Spanish troops had
visited the landmark before, De Vargas apparently was the first person to use the term hueco (hollow in
Spanish) for Hueco Tanks:
ValiÃ©ndome de el yndio Apache, que tengo prisionero desde la primera refriega que tube
con su nazÃ­on el mes de Septiembre pasado; salÃ­, llebando, conmigo no mas que hasta beinte
personas, soldados, y oficiales de esta compa [compaÃ±Ã­a], y dos vezs [vecinos?] que quisieron ir

dicho zerro, y fac dicho espÃ­a tomando la travezÃ­a de un corto aguage que llaman de el Ã¡lamo
(De Vargas 1692:folio 110).
Serving me was an Apache Indian that I held prisoner from the first skirmish that I had
with his people last September. I left, bringing with me no more than 20 persons, soldiers,
and officials of the company, and 2 neighbors that also wanted to go, and 60 Indian war
allies. Passed the night of Saturday, March 8 in the town of Socorro, close to said river of
the north, five long leagues distant from this post. Departed Sunday, the 9th of that month,
between 8 and 9 in the morning, with the war party, and as a guide another Apache Indian
that took me, taking a passage for the hollow hill (cerro hueco) because of marshes and
lands with many little woods that we recognized from the other march. Arriving at sunset
at that hollow hill (cerro hueco), I went ahead with some swift horses; by chance we met up
with some Apaches, because that place was their land, and had their hunting grounds. The
troops all arrived after sunset, and that journey was 12 leagues. The following day, Monday,
at 10 left that hill, and the spy took a course for a small watering place that they call the cottonwood (translation by Antonio Fuentes and Margaret Howard).
The first known Spanish map using the term hueco to designate the Tanks is the Plano del RÃ­o del
Norte desde San Elceario hasta el Paraje de San Pasqual, drawn in the 1770s by Don Bernardo de Miera

81

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

y Pacheco (Broaddus 1976a:9). On the plain above and east of the missions along the Rio Grande, it
depicts Cerro Hueco (the Tanks) on the west side of a mountain range with a tall peak labeled Cerro del
Aire, apparently Cerro Alto (Figure 11; Dominguez 1956:268-269).
The Spanish eventually regained their hold on New Mexico, but most of the exiles that had fled to
the south remained in the villages that had been established along the Rio Grande. Half a century after
they left New Mexico, the displaced Spanish and Native American settlers had established small settlements throughout the El Paso valley, supported by farms watered by irrigation. By 1807 when the first
American account of the valley was recorded by Zebulon Pike, residents were raising herds of cattle
and horses in addition to their irrigated crops (Jackson 1966:50-52). In 1828, the Tiguas at the Pueblo
of Ysleta petitioned the governor of Chihuahua for a grant covering lands located around Sierra Alta
(Cerro Alto), which they had used as community pasture for a number of years. Confirmed and ratified
by the Constitutional Congress of the State of Chihuahua in 1834, this Rancho de Ysleta grant covered
some 800,000 acres, including Hueco Tanks. Later attempts to secure recognition for the grant in U.S.
courts failed, however (Bowden 1971:171-177, 190).
A deterrent to ranching from the late eighteenth century through most of the nineteenth century
was the presence of Mescalero Apache Indians. They had occupied this region since the late seventeenth century and possibly earlier; after adopting the horse, they lived by hunting and seizing livestock
through raids (Opler and Opler 1950:1-2). In December 1777, a Mescalero Apache emissary came to
Paso del Norte to make a peace offer on behalf of bands occupying areas in and near the Sierra Blanca,
Sacramento, and Organ Mountains who had been pushed out of their home ranges by encroaching
Comanche Indians. Around that time, Mescalero Apaches reportedly were camped 10 leagues (ca. 30
miles) from the pass at El Cerro Hueco (Hueco Tanks; see Figure 11) and outside the village of San Elizario (Sonnichsen 1973:54; Thomas 1932:63). After a relatively peaceful period from the 1790s through
the 1820s, Apache raids began anew after the shift from Spanish to Mexican rule in 1821, and by the
1830s almost all of the livestock from settlements in the upper and lower Rio Grande valley had been
captured (Sonnichsen 1973:57-62; Timmons 1990:23-49).
A conflict between Native Americans and Mexican troops in 1839 apparently took place at Hueco
Tanks. As Kiowa informants related to ethnographer James Mooney (1898), a small party of Kiowa
warriors led by Guadalonte and including chief Dohasan approached Paso del Norte but found it wellguarded by Mexican troops. The Kiowas decided not to attack the settlement and left, stopping for
the night at a place where a spring came out of a cave, later named Tsodoigyatadadee, âthe rock house
cave in which they were surrounded.â They described it as a deep rock well containing a large basin of
water with a cave on one side, which ran from the waterâs edge under the rock (Mooney 1898:302). This
description matches the cave at the head of the deep canyon that cuts into the north side of East Mountain (Sharp 1987:87-88).
The Kiowa warriors were soon surrounded by Mexican soldiers, who killed several of their horses
and forced them to seek refuge in the cave. Some Mescalero Apache Indians had accompanied the Mexicans as scouts, and one called out to the Kiowa in the Comanche language, encouraging them to hold
out (Mooney 1898:303).
The Kiowa band was trapped in the cave for several days without food or water. When the men ventured out under cover of darkness to obtain quick drinks or cut flesh from the dead horses, they were
spotted by the Mexican soldiers, and one man was shot in the leg. The Kiowas searched the cave for an
alternate escape route and found a hole leading to the surface, but when a warrior poked his head out of
the opening he was seen by the soldiers, who then blocked it with rocks (Mooney 1898:303).

83

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

After 10 days of confinement the Kiowa warriors developed a plan to escape from the cave after
dark. Dohasan prepared by singing a song that bid defiance to death. He then led the group, climbing up
a cedar tree that grew on the side of the well. A wounded man (Dagoi) was left behind, and another warrior (KoÃ±ate) fell when the Mexican guards heard a noise and shot toward the fleeing group. The warriors made their escape with KoÃ±ate but when he appeared to be near dying, left him at a spring where
he was visited by a spirit that strengthened and instructed him. KoÃ±ate was later rescued by Comanches
and returned home; as directed by the spirit he made a sacred staff and shields, which were used in the
sun dance for many years (Mooney 1898:303-305, 329).
Other similar accounts place this episode at Hueco Tanks but differ in essential facts (Binion 1970:39;
Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:180), and may refer to other events. In 1851, Commissioner John Bartlett
noted that a natural amphitheater in Hueco Tanks was âthe place where Apaches used formerly to hold
their councilsâ and that when around 150 of them had been cornered there, they had built a stone wall
across the canyon but were later killed (Bartlett 1854:174). A few years later, a member of a topographical survey party led by Brevet Captain John Pope reported that around 100 Apaches had been held captive at Hueco Tanks by Mexican forces in 1840, and were almost entirely exterminated (Byrne 1855:69).
Tigua elders have recalled that the scouts who had accompanied the Mexican soldiers were Tiguas (who
commonly served in this role; see Green 1974:83-84; Houser 1979:339-340), and that sacks of burning
peppers (Sharp 1987:89-90) or snakes (Nye 1962:38) were dropped into the cave to make the Kiowas
leave (Comanches in Tigua version; see Green 1974:88-89). According to Martineau (1973:69-83) and
a present-day Kiowa informant (Dewey Tsonetokoy Jr., personal communication 1999), the 1839 battle
scene is depicted on a rock imagery panel at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site (Figure 12).

Given its distance from the river, Hueco Tanks did not support any permanent settlement in the
early nineteenth century, despite its plentiful water supply. Communities clung closely to the Rio Grande
because sustained cultivation depended upon the acequias that conveyed water from it. Dependence
on the river made these towns the victims of almost annual, disastrous floods. Around 1829, the Rio
Grande left its banks and formed a new main channel to the south of Ysleta, Socorro, and San Elizario,
separating those towns from the settlement at Paso del Norte (the present Mexican city of JuÃ¡rez).
Because the old channel continued to flow, the towns were isolated on an island between two stream
courses (Morrow 1981:23). In 1852 the river abandoned the old channel, leaving the three towns on the
north side of the Rio Grande.

84

Historical Background

These shifts in the river had longâterm consequences for the El Paso valley. Within a few years Texas
won its independence from Mexico, and the Rio Grande became the boundary that separated the two
republics. Ysleta, Socorro, and San Elizario were legally part of Texas, but the Mexican state of Chihuahua continued to exercise jurisdiction over them during the Republic period (1836â1846). Following the
United Statesâ war with Mexico (1846â1848), American forces were sent to enforce the claim to the Paso
del Norte area, including the three river towns (White 1961:60-62). Troops were stationed at the pass
from 1848 to 1851, and returned in 1854 when a permanent post was established near Magoffinsville.
The military installation was named Fort Bliss in memory of General Zachary Taylorâs chief of staff
during the Mexican War (Metz 1996). After El Paso County was established in 1850, several small AngloAmerican settlements (including Magoffinsville and Franklin) were incorporated to become the city of
El Paso, which was platted in 1859. These changes reflect the opening of the area to American settlement,
which had profound consequences for the El Paso valley and vicinity.

ON WESTERN TRAIL ROUTES, 1848-1880s
The influx of Anglo-American officials, adventurers, and settlers to the El Paso valley began soon
after the territory was acquired by the United States. Among the first to head west were gold seekers,
beginning around 1848 when news of gold strikes at Sutterâs Mill in California reached the eastern
United States. An estimated one-third of the cross-country travelers journeying to the California goldfields in 1848 and 1849 came through El Paso. As one of the few reliable water sources between the Pecos
River and the Rio Grande, Hueco Tanks soon became an important way station on one of the western
trails. In late April or early May of 1849, the Duval-Harris party was one of the earliest groups of fortune
seekers to stop at the Tanks (Moody 1963:86). Harris later recalled that
The path pointed to a mountain of rocks lying across our course . . . On near approach,
the boulders grew to the view and the travelers wondered how they could be crossed when,
at half a mile of distance, they perceived an aperture in the rocky mass the width of an ordinary door. It enlarged several feet in width when reached and we entered it by a smooth path
without apparent ascent. The boulders receded right and left and we found ourselves in an
enclosed park of a hundred or more acres, containing elder, acacia, and other bushes, and
grass abundant enough for our beasts. This plain was named Hueco Tanks (Dillon 1960:49).
As they explored the rocks in search of water, Harris noted several pictograph panels; his recollections of them are rather fanciful, including âhuge serpents over a hundred feet longâ (Dillon 1960:50).
In eastern and central Texas, communities competed for provisioning and stopover business from
western travelers enroute to the gold fields. Town leaders engaged in arguments over the merits of various western trails, their preference being the one that passed through their town. Two routes across west
Texas became popular with travelers to California during this period: the âemigrantâ or âupperâ road
from San Antonio and Austin to El Paso via Fredericksburg, and the âmilitaryâ or âlowerâ road from
Corpus Christi and San Antonio to El Paso via Las Moras Springs (Martin 1925a:288). Hueco Tanks was
a way point on the upper road (Martin 1925a:298). The redundant âTanksâ designation apparently was
applied at some time in the late 1840s by persons visiting this landmark (e.g., Dillon 1960:49).
In March 1849, the city of Austin financed an expedition led by Indian agent Major Robert S. Neighbors to demonstrate the practicality of the upper road. John S. (Rip) Ford accompanied Neighbors, and

85

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

they were guided by Delaware, Comanche, Shawnee, and Choctaw Indian scouts (Neighbours 1954:38,
41). Initially the road was good, and they met up with the Duval-Harris expedition at the Pecos River
on April 17 (Dillon 1960:45-48; Neighbours 1954:49). Neighbors then headed toward the Davis Mountains, but the group had considerable difficulty finding routes that would accommodate their wagons,
and almost starved to death before entering El Paso in early May.
After hiring a Mexican guide in El Paso, the Neighbors and Ford expedition left San Elizario on May
6 and returned to Austin in just 21 days, proving that the upper road was easily navigable (Leatherwood
1996; Martin 1925a:292-293). Their route passed through Hueco Tanks, as Fordâs map indicates (Figure
13). Neighbors and Ford were impressed by the largest tank, which was inside a cave (Comanche Cave)
and was estimated to contain around 50,000 gallons of water (Greenwood 1944:266; Neighbours 1954:54).
Traffic along the upper road flowed briskly in 1849, bolstered in part by Fordâs description of the
route in the June 23 issue of Austinâs Texas Democrat newspaper (Greenwood 1944:262-268). By August
of that year, another article in that newspaper reported that companies led by P. F. Smith, Captain Tong,

Historical Background

Captain Duval, Bryan, Hayne, Captain Griffin, and Captain Murchison had traversed the route relatively
unscathed, with only one man lost to an Indian attack (Greenwood 1944:269-270). Hueco Tanks must
have been a busy scene in 1849, as Houston resident Cornelius Cox found it on June 26:
Arrived at the âTanksââa mountain similar to the âRockâ I have described [Cornudas
Mountain] and containing an abundance of water. Thompson & Thorns Company together with many other waggons are camped at this placeâ (Martin 1925b:129).
Later in 1849, Captain Randolph B. Marcy traveled along part of the upper road while surveying a
trail from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Fort Smith, Arkansas. He was guided by a Comanche Indian who
âwas born and raised directly in the country over which we desired to pass, and was perfectly familiar
with almost every stream and water-hole upon the prairiesâ (Marcy 1850:196). Marcy arrived at the
âWaco mountainsâ (probably Hueco Tanks) on September 4, and reported that
There is a plain wagon road from here to El Paso. We found a great abundance of good
water in an immense tank up a ravine on the South mountain. This is a huge deep basin,
scooped out of the solid rock with great symmetry and regularity, and of sufficient capacity
to contain several hundred gallons of water. We also found sufficient water for our animals
in the ravine. The road passes between the two mountains, which approach within a few
rods of each other, leaving a level pass, bordered by immense ledges of rocks, standing out
in bold relief directly over the road. The rocks composing the mountains are large masses of
dark-gray sandstone, thrown up in the utmost disorder and confusion, leaving numerous
holes and caverns, which have often served the Apache as hiding places (Marcy 1850:199).
After stopping for a day, Marcyâs party headed east toward the south base of the âCierra [Cerro]
Alto,â and entered a canyon to ascend into the Hueco Mountains. From there he saw the Sierra del
Alamo, which marked the first of a series of water sources on the route to the Pecos River (see Figure
13): Ojos de los Alamos, Cornudas de los Alamos/Thorneâs Well, Crow Spring, the Pinery at Guadalupe
Peak, and Delaware Springs (Marcy 1850:199-203). These springs became customary stopping points
along the upper road.
Army Lieutenants Smith and Whiting, who had been sent along the lower road in February of 1849,
made a favorable report of their journey to El Paso. The lower road eventually was chosen as the military
route to the Rio Grande valley, and Forts Clark, Hudson, Lancaster, and Davis were established along
it (Martin 1925a:293). Among the many maps published as a result of these explorations, Youngâs 1853
Map of the State of Texas shows the routes that Neighbors and Ford, Marcy, and Whiting and Smith
established (Figure 14).
Other early travelers in the El Paso valley included engineers and surveyors for the International Boundary Commission who established the border between the United States and Mexico.
John Russell Bartlett directed the Commission team that visited Hueco Tanks; his narrative includes
descriptions of the rock hills and sketches of pictographs, which are the first published images of
the Tanks (Bartlett 1854:133, 171-173). Bartlettâs description indicates that in November 1850 the
grasses at the Tanks already had been depleted due to grazing by animals carrying passengers along
the upper road:

Figure 14. 1853 map showing Hueco Tanks, on the Neighbors and Ford, Marcy, and Whiting and Smith routes
(Young 1853).

After a little search we found water in a great cavity or natural tank in the rock about
twenty feet above our heads, containing about fifty barrels, pure and sweet. This tank was
covered by a huge boulder, weighing some hundred tons, the lower surface of which was
but four or five feet above the water. Searching along the base of the mountain we found
another cavity, where we watered our animals . . . as there was no grass near, I thought it best
to push on a few miles and stop wherever grass should be found.
The road leads between the great rocky masses described above, when it enters a plain
beyond. . . . We bivouacked. . . after learning that we should find no grass further on. It was
poor here, and only grew in tufts about the roots of the mezquit chapporal [sic] (Bartlett
1854:133-134).

88

Historical Background

Bartlettâs interest in Hueco Tanks caused him to return in May 1851 to investigate it more thoroughly.
His descriptions and drawings indicate that the small party camped on the east side of North Mountain,
near rock imagery site N17G (Miles 1984:68):
The overhanging rock beneath which we encamped seemed to have been a favorite
place of resort for the Indians, as it is at the present day for all passing travelers. The recess formed by this rock is about fifteen feet in length, by ten in width. Its entire surface is
covered with paintings, one laid on over the other; so that it is difficult to make out those
which belong to the aborigines. I copied a portion of these figures, about which there can
be no doubt as to the origin. They represent Indians with shields and bows, painted with a
brownish earth; horses with their riders; uncouth looking animals; and a huge rattlesnake
[rock imagery site N17G]. . . Over these are the figures of late travelers and emigrants; who
have taken this means to immortalize their names, and let posterity know that they were
on their way to California. Near this overhanging rock is the largest and finest tank or pool
of water to be found about here. It is only reached by clambering on the hands and knees
fifteen or twenty feet up a steep rock. Over it projects a gigantic boulder, which, resting on
or wedged between the other rocks, leaves a space of about four feet above the surface of
the water. On the under side of this boulder are fantastic designs in red paint, which could
only have been made by persons lying on their backs in this cool and sheltered spot. One
of these, a singular geometric figure [rock imagery site N17B], I copied while resting in the
same position (Bartlett 1854:171-174).
Hueco Tanks also was used in the 1850s by cattlemen driving herds on the upper road to El Paso
and on to California. Continuing Indian raids made this venture risky. In the summer of 1853, a cattle
drive from Clarksville, Texas left the Guadalupe Mountains and stopped at Silver Mountain (apparently
in the Hueco Mountains; Broaddus 1976a:18). During the night, Apache Indians captured 20 of their
horses and mules. Twelve men rode out the next morning and âfollowed those Indians to their home,
where they saw some of the lost property together with about two hundred Indians, when a general
fight was commenced.â Only three cattlemen escaped on foot; one met up with the drive at âthe Waco
Tankâ (Hueco Tanks) but later died from the fatigue, hunger, and thirst experienced on his forced march
(Austerman 1991:34; Fowler 1853).
Another dispute involving livestock occurred at Hueco Tanks in the summer of 1853. The Wilson
family of Hunt County, Texas joined a wagon train heading west along the route established by Marcy.
At Guadalupe Peak they lost 19 head of cattle in a Mescalero Apache raid, and while they were camped
near Ysleta nearly all of their remaining property was stolen by Mexicans from south of the Rio Grande.
The Wilsons determined to head back east, and on August 1 they seized âquite a number of stockâ
belonging to the Tigua Indians as compensation for their losses. Four Tigua men caught up with them
at Hueco Tanks and demanded that the stolen cattle be returned; G. W. and James Wilson responded
by shooting, but were killed by return fire. The Tiguas did not stop to bury the dead men but took Jane
Wilson and the three young Wilson boys back to Ysleta, along with the cattle. An inquest later found the
Tigua actions to be justified (Bowden 1972:51-52).
One year later, a rail line to the Pacific was proposed to follow the 32nd parallel of latitude, and
parties surveying the route stopped at the Tanks in January and February of 1854. The Texas Western
Railroad survey was made by Andrew Gray in January of that year (Gray 1856). In February, a U.S. topographical survey party led by Brevet Captain John Pope stopped at Hueco Tanks. The expedition diary

89

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

kept by âassistant computerâ J. H. Byrne noted that their thirsty mules and stock âquickly exhausted the
tanks on the west side of the mountain. That upon the east, however, afforded an ample supplyâ (Byrne
1855:68). After camping for five days the men and animals had almost exhausted the water in the Tanks,
so they filled their water barrels and headed east toward Sierra (Cerro) Alto (Byrne 1855:68-70).
In 1858, Hueco Tanks served as a stage stop for the Butterfield Overland Mail, which made semiweekly runs from St. Louis to San Francisco. The water supply at the Tanks was depleted by drought
when the first westbound stage reached the meal and change station in late September 1858, according
to journalist Waterman Ormsby:
On reaching the Waco Tanks we found an excellent corral and cabin built; but to our
consternation the station keeper pointed to two eight gallon kegs, saying, âThat is all the
water we have left for a dozen men and as many head of cattle.â The Waco Tanks have been
reported to be inexhaustible, but the unusual droughts had drained them, and the most
rigorous search through the mountain did not bring to light any more. The tanks had been
recently enlarged, so as to hold water enough to last a year when the rain next fell, but until
that time the station would have to be abandoned, unless by chance water could be found
in the vicinity. We changed horses here and took supper, and a few hoursâ ride brought us
to Franklin City, on the Rio Grande river, opposite the ancient town of El Paso [Paso del
Norte, later Cuidad JuÃ¡rez] (Ormsby 1858).
Within the next few months, accounts by two newspaper correspondents traveling east on the Butterfield stage provide additional glimpses of the stage station at Hueco Tanks. Special correspondent J.
M. Farwell was at Fort Chadbourne on November 1, 1858 when he made this report to the Daily Alta
California:
Leaving El Paso on the morning of the 27th, we passed Fort Bliss, about two miles out.
It is 30 miles to the Sierra Gueco, or âMountain Hollow,â or tank, as you may translate it,
over a level but very sandy road. . . At this place, we found an excellent supper awaiting
us. After partaking of which, and having a few moments to spare, I went, in company of
one of the keepers of the station, to visit some caves in the rocks near by. This place is said
to have been the former residence of a tribe of the Comanches, who were driven from it
by the Mexicans. Our guide had brought with him a light by which we were enabled to
see numerous hyeroglyphics, both cut and painted, upon the face of the rock. There was
painted a rattlesnake, some 30 feet in length, darting at what is supposed to be an enemy
of the Comanches. Another was a horse, caparisoned for battle, animals of various kinds,
a representation of the dwellings of several tribes, one of their towns cut in the rock,
three Comanche warriors, mounted, with lances in rest, rushing upon their foes, and
one figure, which particularly attracted my attention, represented an altar, with burning
lights upon it, as though prepared for some ceremony. Time would not permit a stay of
but a very few moments, and I reluctantly left. There are, I am told, several other caves in
the immediate neighborhood, which are covered on their interior surfaces with devices
of various kinds.
We were soon seated in the coach, and as we turned the corner of the station house,
could see at a distance the camp fire of the Apaches (Lang 1945:120-121).

90

Historical Background

An anonymous special correspondent for the San Francisco Daily Evening Bulletin gave a similar
account of his stopover at Hueco Tanks in a report sent from Fort Smith, Arkansas on November 25, 1858:
The Huaco Tanks are excavations made at the bottom of an immense pile of denuded
rocks. One of the tanks, the largest, is capable of containing over a thousand barrels of water.
The rocks at this station are visible for a distance of twenty miles on the plain. When they
are reached they present a most wild and imposing aspect. Cathedral-like in shape, they appear as though pushed up out of the earth in a confused mass of solidity, with their bases
surrounded by firm, even and pebbly-ground walks. After a most excellent supper, consisting of venison and other station delicacies, such as beans, and something elseâwhich this
time chanced to be an apple pieâwe were told that horses had been sent off, twenty miles
on, the previous day, for water, there being no supply here, and they were shortly expected.
Darkness had now set in, when Mr. Losiez, the station-keeper, proposed to show some
Indian haunts among the rocks, which of course I readily accepted. Guarded by a lanternâs
uncertain glare, we proceeded to a very massive rock, at the base of a huge pile, and found
a projection of a ledge of over thirty feet. On the walls of this projection were painted, in
red and black characters, many Indian hieroglyphics and signs, and also some rude sketches
of white men and Indians on horseback, riding against each other with spear and lance. . .
. I here had the pleasure of meeting Major C. Stilghman, one of the Companyâs agents and
found in him a very intelligent and agreeable person (Lang 1945:35-36).
The Butterfield Overland Mail stage road at Hueco Tanks (Figure 15) is said to have âfollowed a
course southwest through the natural amphitheatre, emerging on the open plain at the westâ (Conkling
and Conkling 1947:410: Dominguez 1986:133). The stage station and associated corral reportedly were
built into the northeast outcropping of rocks (Leach 1958:135), and were made of rocks and adobe:
The station, which was a meal and change station, was located on the flat plain on the
north side of the Tanks near the entrance leading into the natural amphitheater through
which the mail road led. The station is described as a house built of rock slabs and adobe
surrounded by a high walled corral built of the same material. . . .
The list of travelers who passed by here and left their names in various places about the
Tanks is a long one. A. C. Morris, W. B. Moody, and J. Norboe were here on July 7, 1856, and
J. A. Terry, who is said to have been one of the Butterfield freighters, was here on June 24,
1858 (Conkling and Conkling 1947:407-409).
By 1859, the Butterfield and other mail coaches, and most of the traffic from emigrants, merchants,
and stock-drivers had shifted to the lower road, to take advantage of protection from Indian attacks
offered by the forts that had been established along it (Martin 1925a:300). Known as the military road,
the lower route bypassed Hueco Tanks altogether. In early years of the Civil War, Confederate cavalry
companies traveled along this route to reach New Mexico, stopping at Fort Bliss in July and December
1861. They occupied Mesilla, from which they launched a campaign to capture New Mexico and Arizona, but returned to Fort Bliss in defeat in May 1862 (Wooster 1996:123).
The events of the Civil War affected Hueco Tanks only peripherally, but the Tanks did serve as a way
point in the fall of 1862 during a campaign by Union troops to drive scattered Mescalero Apache bands

onto reservation land. General James H. Carletonâs strategy was to attack the Indians from the north,
west, and southwest. The southwestern force was directed by Captain Roberts, and consisted of two
companies of soldiers from California; Roberts also was authorized to employ 20 Indians and Mexicans
from Ysleta, Socorro, and San Elizario. Robertsâ contingent left Franklin (El Paso) on November 15, and
âwas sent into the same region [southern New Mexico] from the south, by way of the Hueco (Wacco)
tanks.â By February 1863, most of the Mescalero Apaches had been gathered on a reservation at Fort
Sumner (Dunn 1886:333; Opler and Opler 1950:13-16). Isolated raids continued into the late 1870s, and
in 1878, buffalo soldiers from the Tenth Cavalry M Company under Captain S. T. Norvell patrolled the
area from the Pecos River west to Hueco Tanks, in search of Mescalero Apache bands (Leckie 1967:191).
El Paso had been identified as a prime location for a transcontinental railroad by travelers and government officials as early as the 1850s, and several companies began scouting the area during the 1870s.
When the Texas and Pacific Railway began to plan a line from Texas to California, a route was proposed
to run through Hueco Pass, near Hueco Tanks. As an incentive for constructing the rail line, the state
of Texas granted the company â14,000,000 acres of land in Texas for sale to actual settlers on long timeâ
(Colton and Colton 1873). Much of the land around El Paso was slow to sell, however. In the fall of 1878,
the Texas and Pacific Railway Company still held 2,600 unlocated land certificates out of the 8,083 it had
received for building lines east of Fort Worth (Bowden 1975:5). The company employed Jacob Kuechler

92

Historical Background

to survey desirable sections between the Pecos River and the Rio Grande, including Hueco Tanks and
vicinity. Kuechlerâs journal indicates that the survey crew camped in the shelter of the old Butterfield
stage station at the Tanks on December 25-27, 1878 (Bowden 1975:35-36).
Arrival of the railroads in 1881 ushered in an era of prosperity and growth for the city and county
of El Paso that lasted through the 1920s. The Southern Pacific Railroad extended east from California to reach El Paso in May 1881. The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad transcontinental line
completed a branch route to El Paso in June 1881, and a bridge across the Rio Grande connected it to
the Mexican Central Railroad the following year (Jones 1973:157). In less than two years, El Paso had
become a stop on two transcontinental and international rail routes.
After these rail lines were established, most westward pioneers abandoned the ground route through
Hueco Tanks; the speed and comfort of rail travel eliminated the need for stops at such remote watering
places (Dominguez 1986:134). The Tanks resumed their role as a desert oasis for occasional travelers
to and from El Paso. Texas Ranger James Gillett stopped there early in 1880, en route to the Guadalupe
Mountains to pick up a wagon abandoned by mining engineers who had lost their horses in an Apache
raid. Gillett noted the many inscriptions by travelers and pictures drawn by Indians in sheltered areas
on the east side of the rock hills:
. . . one of which was quite artistic and depicted a huge rattlesnake on the rock under the
cave near the stage stand on the eastern side of Hueco [rock imagery site N17G].
Many times when scouting in the Sacramento and Guadalupe Mountains I have camped
for the night in the Huecos. Sometimes the water in the tanks had all been used up by the
travelers but there was always plenty of cool rain-water twenty-five feet above the main
ground tanks. Often I have watered my entire command by scaling the mountain to these
hidden tanks and, filling our boots and hats with water, poured it on the flat, roof-like rocks
so it would run down into the tanks below (Gillett 1925:175).
Native American presence at Hueco Tanks also continued. In the late nineteenth century, Tiguas
from Ysleta established camps at the Tanks while hunting deer in the Hueco and Finlay Mountains to
the east and southeast. In September 1894, a Tigua hunting party commemorated their stay at Hueco
Tanks by inscribing their names (Lus Pedrasa, Panchita Paiz, Lus Granio, Damacio Colmenero, Bibian
[Granillo], A. O. [Alfredo Olguin], M. O. [Meleton Olguin], F. O. [Frank Olguin], and J. P. [unknown])
in rockshelters on the north side of East Mountain. Additional Tigua inscriptionsâJesÃºs Rodela and
Antonio Silvasâare undated but also may have been made during this period, marked on the rock at
the east entrance to the central basin (Gerald 1974a:59-60).

THE RANCHING ERA, 1895-1956
As El Pasoâs lower valley farmland became more precious, stock raisers began moving their cattle,
horse, sheep, and goat herds to areas distant from the irrigation canals. Use of the land above the river
valley incurred many hazards, however. Bandits preyed on isolated herdsmen, and Mescalero Apaches
continued to raid ranches and settlements. The most persistent challenge to ranching was the arid climate. In an area that typically received around 8 inches of precipitation in a year, ranchers staked their
livelihoods on the hope that rain would provide sufficient water and grass for their herds. Some years
were plagued by drought, and only the stock that had access to water survived. As one of the few water
93

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

sources on the plain above the lower valley, Hueco Tanks was a highly desirable ranch location. By the
mid-1880s the Tanks were being used temporarily by ranchers who reportedly took their stock there
several times a year, and âdrain[ed] the rocks dryâ (El Paso Times, June 28, 1885).
The earliest legal records on the tracts that now comprise Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site
date to the mid-1870s, when the land was granted to the Texas and Pacific Railway Company to help
finance the construction of their line to California. Located in Block 77 of Township North 1 of the
Texas and Pacific Railway Company Survey, the present park covers parts of Sections 9, 10, 15, and 16
(Texas General Land Office Files 54764, 116725, S-29099, S-29100).
In 1887, the Texas and Pacific Railway Company sold Sections 9 and 15 to Charles J. Canda et al. (El
Paso County Deed Record 17:1). Candaâs partner was Edwin Einstein, who had represented New York in
the U.S. House of Representatives from 1879 to 1881, and later served as New York City dock commissioner (United States Congress 2005:1008). Canda and Einstein apparently were speculating in railroad
property, as Canda had corresponded with New York land speculator Charles Butler a decade earlier
(Butler 1876-1877), and Einstein was associated with a number of investment companies (United States
Congress 2005:1008). It is unlikely that Canda or Einstein ever saw the west Texas property they had
purchased.
The tracts came under local ownership in August 1895, when prominent El Paso area politician Juan
Armendariz purchased Sections 9, 10, and 15 (El Paso County Deed Record 40:210; Texas General Land
Office School File 36899); he later forfeited Section 10 due to non-payment of interest (Texas General
Land Office School File 36899). The role of Armendariz as dueÃ±o (owner/manager) or propietario (proprietor) of the Hueco Tanks area is also documented by two large stone slabs (one fragmentary) found
in the park that bear these severely eroded inscriptions:
1895 [A]ÃO \ JUAN ARMENDA[RIZ] \ DUE[ÃO] DE ESTE C/ EL SERRO[?]
ARME[NDARIZ]\ PROPIEâ¦
Most records show Armendariz to be a native of Socorro, but the 1880 U. S. census lists his birthplace as Mexico. This may be due to the fact that he was born around 1845, when Socorro was still part
of Mexico. The 1880 El Paso County census lists him as a 35-year-old merchant living in the Socorro
area. His household included 25-year-old Filiberta (his second wife), 18-year-old daughter Ponciana
(child of first wife Andrea Padilla), adopted sons Jose Miller and Cecilio Cadena, and adopted daughter
Ysabel Cadena (1880 census records, Texas State Library and Archives Commission; El Paso County
Deed Record 135:121). Armendariz had obtained a patent to establish the Corporation of Socorro on
February 14, 1879 (Morrow 1989a:10), and claimed numerous parcels of land in the Pueblo de Socorro
Grant (White 1961:103-107). The Hueco Tanks tracts became part of the desert empire that Armendariz
amassed by the turn of the century.
Armendarizâ income stemmed from his occupation as a businessman, merchant, and cattleman.
His large grocery store was a major landmark in Socorro, located adjacent to the Tienda de Carbajal
on the south side of Socorro Road. Like many storekeepers at the time, he served as a one-man bank,
lending money to farmers and cattlemen in the Socorro area, particularly Mexican Americans who were
afforded little credit from the Anglo-American newcomers (Morrow 1989a:10).
Armendariz became an important Hispanic player in El Paso County politics during the last quarter of the nineteenth century. He served El Paso County as Sheriff from 1869 to 1871, as Treasurer in
1879, and as Commissioner of Precinct 3 in 1878 through 1904 (El Paso Herald-Post, January 6, 1936;
94

Long 1931:Tables 1, 4-5). In addition to his extensive ranch holdings on the plain above the lower valley,
Juan Armendariz also owned a house in Socorro. Still standing, it is located at 10277 Socorro Road and
sometimes is called Los Portalesânot to be confused with Los Portales of nearby San Elizario (Morrow
1989b). An Armendariz Ranch depicted on 1896 and 1908 USGS maps (Figure 16) also is likely to have
been owned by him. Located on the edge ofFigure
the plain above
?? the lower valley, the complex was known
locally as San Felipe and included a house and outbuildings; little evidence of it remains today.

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Silverio Escontrias first became legally associated with the property that would become Hueco Tanks
State Park and Historic Site in September 1898, when he applied to the state of Texas for the purchase
of Section 10, on which most of the park is located (Texas General Land Office File 54764). Armendariz
had owned that section from May 1895 to April 1898, and Escontrias may have had a prior, informal agreement with Armendariz regarding use of it for grazing purposes. Differing accounts cloud the
nature of the relationship between these two men. Escontrias was variously called Armendarizâ godson,
adopted son, ranch foreman, and business associateâall of these terms may be somewhat accurate. He
never appeared as a member of the Armendariz household on available county census records, however
(1870-1920 census records, Texas State Library and Archives Commission).
Armendariz was already a large landholder when he is said to have brought his godson Silverio
Escontrias from La Luz, New Mexico to run the ranch at Hueco Tanks (Miles 1984:68). Escontrias
reportedly moved to the lower valley from New Mexico between 1887 and 1900, and built an adobe
house that still stands at 10411 Alameda Avenue in Socorro, near the Escontrias School that is named
for him (El Paso Herald-Post, September 14, 1932; Morrow 1989a). Another source claims that Escontrias moved to the lower valley as a young child in the late 1870s, residing in the vicinity of Socorro or
Hueco Tanks for the rest of his life (El Paso Times, September 14, 1932). Whatever the case, it appears
that Escontrias established a close relationship with the older man, and named two of his children after
Armendariz and his wife.
One of these ranchers was described by a visitor to El Pasoâs Horse Restaurant in 1893 (Eickemeyer
1894). Near the stalls in a corral adjoining the restaurant, Eickemeyer met a rancher from Hueco Tanks
who may have been Juan Armendariz (age 48) but is more likely to have been Silverio Escontrias, who
was about 21 years of age at that time. Eickemeyer described him in a letter to a friend:
As we returned toward the gate, a young man stepped out of the office, and we were
introduced to him as a ranchman from Hueco Tanks. He was a handsome young fellow,
about twenty-five years of age, straight as an arrow, and dressed in Mexican style. A real
sombrero ornamented with gold and silver braid covered his black hair, and his dark eyes
and smooth face smiling under the broad brim made you pleased to shake hands with him.
A black jacket, light-colored pantaloons, and an embroidered vest completed his suit. Two
or three other gentlemen joined us, and the conversation turned from horses and burros to
politics. . . (Eickemeyer 1894:30).
Silverio Escontrias had married Pilar Loya at San Felipe in the early 1890s (Davis and Chamblin 1948?:1811), probably at Armendarizâ ranch home (near the present Cattlemenâs Steakhouse). The
couple (Figure 17) settled at Hueco Tanks with their family, which eventually grew to include 10 children: seven sonsâJuan, Jose (Joe), Pedro (Pete), Ramon, Santiago (Jim), Silverio Ramon II, and Carlos
(Charlie)âand three daughtersâManuela (Apodaca), Feliberta (Marquez), and Fidencia (Aguirre) (El
Paso Times, September 14, 1932).
By 1898 when he notified the state of Texas of his intention to buy land at Hueco Tanks, Silverio
Escontrias was a young man of 26. Identifying himself as a resident of Socorro in El Paso County,
he filed to purchase Section 10 of Block 77 in Township 1 of the Texas and Pacific Railway Grant on
September 27, 1898, agreeing to pay $1.00 per acre for 640 acres of dry grazing land, at 3 percent interest
per year. This section encompasses most of present Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site including
the adobe house and stone ruins, and was awarded to Escontrias in April of 1899 (Texas General Land
Office School File 54764).

1948?:1812-1813).

Some five years later, Juan Armendariz died unexpectedly on August 21, 1904 (El Paso County Deed
Record 135:121; El Paso Times, August 24, 1904; El Paso Herald-Post, January 6, 1936). The demise of
Armendariz apparently prompted Silverio Escontrias to secure additional acreage around his homestead on Section 10. One month after Armendarizâ death, the following advertisement appeared:
For Sale: this fine ranch, stocked, plenty of water and grass. See or write J. W. Magoffin, 105
South Oregon St. Hueco Tanks is 28 miles from El Paso (El Paso Herald, September 29, 1904).
On December 6, 1904, Escontrias filed an Application & Affidavit to Purchase Additional Lands,
stating that he had lived continuously in a house on Section 10 since 1898. Six years had passed since
his application to purchase that tract, and property values had risen. Escontrias agreed to pay $1.22 per
acre for Section 16 of Block 77 in Township 1â640 acres of dry [sic] grazing land. A note on the sleeve
of that application suggests that Escontrias had been leasing Section 16 from Juan Armendariz. Dated
December 13, 1904, it reads âJuan Armendoriz [sic] lessee has 60 ds [days] preference right from Nov. 1,
04 to purchase as o/s. You should file, at once, proof of 3 yrs occupancy on your house sectionâ (Texas
General Land Office School File 80846). On December 24, 1904, Escontrias filed a Proof of Occupancy
form for Section 10 with the state of Texas, stating that he had improved it as follows:
I have built one adobe house for my home. consisting of four rooms, and a hall also
a stone house also fencing for corrals etc. all to more than the value of three hundred

97

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

dollarsâsaid stone house consisting of three rooms and also a stone stable (Texas General
Land Office School File 54764).
The adobe house and ruins of the two stone buildings constructed by Silverio Escontrias are
on the northeast side of North Mountain in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site. They closely
resemble their 1904 description: the adobe building (Figure 18a) has a central hall and four rooms,
the stone structure to the east has three rooms and probably was the stone house (Escontrias and
Escontrias 1996), and the two-room stone structure on the west apparently was the stable (Figure
18b). Escontrias may have built these structures using stones from the abandoned Butterfield Mail
stage station, which apparently was located around 250 yards south of his homestead (see Features,
Structures, and Distributions).
The family lived in the houses at Hueco Tanks and raised cattle and horses. The boys were occupied
with ranch work like rounding up livestock and marking them with the family brandâthe letters S E
[Silverio Escontrias] with a bar underneath. Neighbors used the tanks to water their wagon teams, stopping by after going to El Paso for supplies (Turner 1984). Relatives in Socorro would bring hay out to the
ranch and return with a wagonload of firewood for their own use (Ledesma 1995). Native Americans,
including Apaches, also stopped at the Tanks for water and to trade horses. The Escontrias family lived
at the ranch for six years before moving back to Socorro around 1910, so their children could attend
school. At that time, Silverio Escontrias turned over the day-to-day operation of the Hueco Tanks ranch
to his eldest son Juan (Turner 1984).
The ranch continued to expand in the early twentieth century through the generosity of the descendants of Silverio Escontriasâ benefactor. Juan Armendarizâ estate had been inherited by his daughter
Ponciana and second wife Filiberta. According to Escontrias family members, Armendarizâ widow did
not know what to do with the ranch land around the Tanks (Ledesma 1995). In 1910, Filiberta conveyed
all of her interest to Ponciana, but her step-daughter passed away in 1911 (Socorro Mission Cemetery
records). Silverio Escontrias was appointed by the El Paso County Court as independent executor of
Poncianaâs estate. In her will, Ponciana had bequeathed her undivided interest in the âHueco Tanks
Ranchâ to Escontrias, including Sections 5, 9, 15, 21, and others; she also left him âwhat is known as
Santa Rosa Ranchâ (El Paso County Deed Records 135:121, 168:324, 272:23, 270:81).
Upon receiving this property in 1915, Silverio Escontrias possessed at least six sections centered on
Hueco Tanks, four of which (9, 10, 15, and 16) would eventually comprise the park. He paid in full for
Sections 10 and 16 and patented them in October 1919 (El Paso County Deed Record 25:491-492; Texas
General Land Office School Files 54764, 80846).
Juan Escontrias had begun purchasing sections east and south of Hueco Tanks in 1911, complementing the acquisition of additional sections by his father. By 1920, the elder Escontrias took over
payments on the tracts applied for by his son, and the Hueco Tanks Ranch continued to grow (Texas
General Land Office Files 116735, 116724). According to family accounts, Silverio Escontrias eventually
ran about 2,000 head of high quality Hereford cattle on some 6,000 acres on the arid plain above the
lower valley, most centered on the initial sections he had acquired at Hueco Tanks. He also amassed farm
land in the fertile lower valley, and property in Socorro; the Escontrias family eventually owned some 20
sections of land in El Paso County (Davis and Chamblin 1948?:1811; Turner 1984).
When the family moved to Socorro, Silverio acquired a 100 acre farm with a house near the railroad
station at Belen (now known as Buford). There he grew alfalfa and cotton in the tradition of the lower
valleyâs recently arrived Anglo-American farmers. He also purchased a farm at Aldama, to the east of
Fabens. According to sons Jim and Charlie, although Escontrias maintained an active interest in his

Hueco Tanks ranch, he concentrated his efforts on supervising cotton and alfalfa production on the
homestead farm near Belen (Turner 1984).
The Escontrias home in Socorro is on land once owned by Juan Armendariz, and faces Alameda
Avenue. That street was built while Armendariz served on the El Paso County Commissioners Court,
and was the first improved road to link El Paso with the lower valley towns of Ysleta, Socorro, and San
Elizario. Escontrias purchased a parcel of land from the Armendariz survey that spanned both sides of
the county road and built a home there, probably some years before the deed was filed in 1915. Silverio
and Pilarâs youngest son Charlie and his wife later lived in the family home where Charlie was born in
1926 (Escontrias 1995).
In addition to his ranching and farming operations, Silverio Escontrias became active in civic affairs
in his adopted town of Socorro, and served his community as an elected leader. He was the El Paso County
deputy sheriff for nearly 35 years, and gained a reputation as a political figure in the lower valley (El
Paso Herald-Post, September 14, 1932). His most lasting contribution may have been his support for construction of a new elementary school in Socorro. In the early 1920s when promotions lured thousands of
Anglo-American farmers to the valley, the county school board decided to close the old Socorro school,
build elementary schools in Ysleta and Clint, and divide the Socorro children between the new schools.
Socorro residents protested the loss of their local school. Escontrias helped to resolve the situation by
donating 3 acres in Socorro for the site of a new school, and selling 4 more acres at a reduced price. His
condition was that the school would accept both Mexican American and Anglo-American children. The
donation was accepted, and after a $20,000 bond was passed a new school was built in 1923 for grades
one through eight. Escontrias was named a trustee of the new school and served in that capacity until his
deathâthe only Hispanic board member during a period of increasing Anglo-American settlement. The
Hispanic students who attended the small school were descendants of some of the earliest settlers in the
Socorro grant, including the Apodaca and Lujan families (La Acequia 1924:42). Located across Alameda
Avenue from the Escontrias house, the Escontrias School is still in active use and has been recommended
for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (Myers and Williams 1994:181).
Although the Escontrias familyâs primary residence was in Socorro, they often spent summers working and relaxing at their Hueco Tanks ranch (Turner 1984; Ledesma 1995). In the 1910s and 1920s, older
sons and daughters who had started their own families would bring their children to the Tanks to camp,
picnic, and help with ranch maintenance. Relatives were often hired as ranch hands or caretakers, while
Silverioâs sons assumed some of their fatherâs responsibilities on his other properties.
While the Escontrias family operated their Hueco Tanks ranch, curiosity seekers, amateur archeologists, and scholars continued to seek access to the rock imagery, and were allowed to visit the area. With
the advent of the automobile, El Paso and valley residents could travel to the Tanks with relative ease
over gravel roadsâone that approximated the route of the old Butterfield Overland Stage and a second
that led directly to Socorro. Over the years, the Hueco Tanks ranch grazed fewer cattle and became
more of a tourist attraction, known for its rock imagery and picnicking opportunities (Gillett 1925:175;
Ledesma 1995).

RECREATION AND OTHER ACTIVITIES, 1900-1956
El Paso and the surrounding region were changing rapidly at the turn of the century. Between 1890
and 1900 the population of the county grew from around 16,000 to 25,000 (Bryson 1996:850). Trouble
along the border with Mexico escalated in 1914, when Francisco âPanchoâ Villa began his three-year

100

Historical Background

raid. Fort Bliss had expanded in 1891; it became a center of military activity in 1916 when General
Pershing assembled troops to deter Villaâs activities, and again when the United States entered World
War I. Elephant Butte Dam was completed in 1916, and provided a source for irrigation water that was
reliable enough to support commercial farming, which attracted newcomers, mainly Anglo-American.
Hudspeth County broke off from El Paso County in 1917, with the western border of the new county
located a few miles east of Hueco Tanks. Although this reduced the acreage of El Paso County, its population continued to increase. Hudspeth County reported only 962 residents in the 1920 census (Kohout
1996:764), while the city of El Paso alone had a population that exceeded 77,000 by 1925 (Timmons
1996:847). The metropolitan area was becoming one of the major commercial centers of the southwestern United States, featuring a railroad hub, a military post, smelting facilities, and a large-scale agriculture industry. The frontier settled, El Paso residents began looking for recreational opportunities in the
surrounding desert and mountains.
Conversion of Hueco Tanks into a resort had been proposed as early as 1885 (El Paso Times, June 28,
1885), and a 1909 editorial stated that âthe county should by all means take steps to acquire and protect
the Hueco Tanks district as a public parkâ (El Paso Herald, July 19, 1909). A 1913 article recommended
that the city of El Paso acquire the Tanks and âput a caretaker in charge to prevent further despoliation
of the indian hieroglyphics and pioneer inscriptionsâ (El Paso Herald, February 3, 1913). The Escontrias
family had opened the Tanks to the public soon after acquiring them at the turn of the century, but in
1915 and 1916, misbehavior by visitors who were âshooting, cursing the caretaker, and other unlawful actsâ caused an angry Silverio Escontrias, âowner of the ground upon which Hueco Natural park
is located to post notices that the park will be closed to everyone in the futureâ (El Paso Herald, April
28, 1915; June 2, 1916). Escontrias declared that a deputy sheriff would be stationed at the site to file
complaints against all trespassers. It is possible that Escontriasâ attitude also was influenced by increased
Army presence in the area during the Mexican Revolution, as indicated by a 1916 Progressive Military
Map that shows Hueco Tanks and other features of eastern El Paso County in great detail, suggesting
that maneuvers were conducted there (Figure 19).
El Paso County launched a road construction initiative in 1913 and an expanded county road network was in place by 1916, coinciding with increased agricultural development of the lower valley. Better roadways improved the flow of farm to market traffic and allowed families in El Pasoâs new suburban
developments, built in the 1920s, to travel throughout the county. As greater access to automobiles
offered El Paso citizens more options for weekend recreation, newspaper articles encouraged them to
visit nearby sites like Hueco Tanks. A 1923 article extolled the wonders of âOur Nearby Garden of the
Godsâ and advised tourists to âsecure permission at the house before entering tanks proper, which is
closed to autos and wagonsâ (El Paso Times, June 10, 1923). By that time the Escontrias family had
reopened Hueco Tanks, in response to increasing public pressure and possibly due to the decline of
military operations in the vicinity.
The road trip from El Paso to Hueco Tanks was 31 miles long and took two hours by motorcar;
motorists were advised that the road was sandy in places, but was possible to negotiate in high gear (El
Paso Times, June 10, 1923). The old stage road that ran through the center of the Tanks served as the
main route from El Paso to Hueco Tanks (El Paso Herald, February 3, 1913) until around 1921-1922,
when that section was fenced off. The new road redirected traffic around the west and north side of the
Tanks (Conkling and Conkling 1947:410), and allowed the Escontrias family to divert traffic away from
an earthen dam they had built across the central basin by 1916, one of three dams on the property by
that time. Thirteen additional earth and/or masonry dams were built around the tanks over the following decades (see Features, Structures, and Distributions) to capture runoff water from the rocks and
provide it to livestock.

Historical Background

Public access to this recreational destination continued in the late 1920s (Figure 20), and was
improved in 1928 when U.S. Highway 62 was built to connect El Paso with Carlsbad, New Mexico.
Access to the Hueco Tanks ranch was curtailed again in 1930, however, after careless hunters killed off
part of the Escontrias cattle herd. Even after that episode, visitors were allowed to tour the Tanks after
securing a pass (El Paso Times, September 14, 1932). In the 1930s the Escontrias family began charging
admission (Ledesma 1995).

Historical Society.

The Tiguas continued to use Hueco Tanks as a base camp for hunting trips. Tigua elder Miguel
Pedraza recalled a trip in 1922, when he and five companions stayed in a rockshelter on the northwest
side of the Tanks near a well-known Tigua meeting placeâa rockshelter containing three bedrock mortars known as Tres Tinajas. From their camp, older men led the young men on a hunt that encompassed
the area from the Finlay Mountains to Cerro Alto (Gerald 1974a:60).
Pablo Silvas and other Tiguas also recalled that an Apache Indian woman named Beatriz Guerra
and her family occupied a rockshelter near the north end of East Mountain at some point during the
first half of the twentieth century. They built a rock wall across the front of the shelter and lived there
for many months, or possibly a few years. The family herded goats and made cheese (Binion 1970:53;
Gerald 1974a:61).
Hueco Tanks and other archeological sites in the region became known more widely in the 1920s,
due to the efforts of the El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS). Formed in 1922 by El Paso citizens interested in the archeology of the American Southwest, EPAS promoted the preservation and investigation
of regional archeological sites (Hedrick 1972:51-52; Walsh 1950:1). The Society drew attention to Hueco

Tanks and other local archeological sites through newspaper columns written by EPAS president Martin
L. Crimmins and photographs taken by vice president Otis A. Aultman (Figure 21; see Figure 12).
Early in 1927, EPAS president R. P. Anderson announced that prehistoric artifacts had been discovered in caves in the Hueco Mountains, and invited the Smithsonian Institution to inspect them (El Paso
Post, March 18, 1927; April 29, 1927). In September of that year, Smithsonian representatives examined
the stone and bone tools, beads, ornaments, and fiber sandals dug from the caves by R. W. Stafford,
and concluded that early Pueblo Indians had lived in the area. Uncontrolled excavations in the caves by
Stafford and others resulted in the loss of scientific data; Stafford planned to sell his finds to a wealthy
collector, and said that another group was digging in nearby caves under prospector leases (El Paso Post,
September 15, 1927). EPAS member Eileen Alves and her husband purchased the collection (Cosgrove
1947:35) and donated it to Gila Pueblo in Arizona; it was eventually transferred to The University of
Texas at Austin (Almarez and Leach 1997:29; Creel 1997:77).
104

Historical Background

EPAS members were well aware of the protection offered by public land status, and spearheaded
early attempts to designate Hueco Tanks as a public park (Hedrick 1972:52). Colonel Crimmins was the
chief proponent of archeological research on the rock imagery of the Tanks and other sites in the region.
He argued that Hueco Tanks and other âtreasure houses of archeologyâ should be made into national
parks so the government could prevent mutilation of the ancient records they contained (El Paso Post,
July 10, 1929). He encouraged the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society to appoint a committee to look into preserving Hueco Tanks and Paint Rock as state parks (El Paso Herald, October 28,
1930), and urged the local chapter of the Texas Federation of Womenâs Clubs and the El Paso Chamber
of Commerce to seek the designation of Hueco Tanks as a state or county park (El Paso Times, November 24, 1930).
Although these efforts were not successful, the many discoveries made in Hueco Mountain caves and
at Hueco Tanks over the next few years substantiated Crimminsâ contention that these sites were national
treasures. Scientific investigations conducted in the Hueco Mountain caves often included side trips to
Hueco Tanks (see Prehistoric Background). A. T. Jackson of the University of Texas had first seen the rock
imagery at the Tanks in 1927, and returned to document it in 1935 (Jackson 1935). EPAS members like
Eileen Alves fueled local interest by giving public lectures on the archeology of the region, and displaying
artifacts from local sites (El Paso World News, March 10, 1933; El Paso Herald-Post, March 17, 1933). The
discovery bug bit people from all walks of life, including members of the Escontrias family. The El Paso
Times reported on May 16, 1931 that adventurers N. Aguirre and Juan Escontrias had discovered bone
beads, rope remnants, and corn after digging through 4 ft of refuse in Hueco Mountain caves.
Juan also continued to run the livestock operation at Hueco Tanks, but the 1930s brought economic
and personal reversals that affected the course of the ranch. Most significant was the passing of Silverio
Escontrias on September 13, 1932 (El Paso Times, September 14, 1932). Operation of the Hueco Tanks
ranch was turned over to his son Jim (Santiago), and another son, Ramon, assumed responsibility for
the ranch when Jim married and moved to El Paso around 1939 (Turner 1984).
The steady growth of El Paso CountyâEl Pasoâs population doubled twice between 1900 and
1930âwas finally halted by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The cityâs population declined by more
than 6,000 during that decade (Lynn et al. 1975:14). Several Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) units
of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) were dispatched to the El Paso valley to work on dams,
drainage canals, roads, and other projects. By the end of the depression the WPA had built 367 miles
of road in the El Paso district (El Paso Herald-Post, March 19, 1940). CCC crews often constructed recreational facilities, and Hueco Tanks was identified as one of several sites in the El Paso area with good
potential for development as parks.
In the mid 1930s, a brief, intense effort was made to turn Hueco Tanks into a state park. J. E. Pearce
of the University of Texas had recommended the Tanks to the National Park Service in a report stating
that âThis site with its rugged beauty, coupled with its archeological importance, lends itself to park
purposesâ (Pearce 1934). In March 1935, the El Paso Times reported that state park officials, in conjunction with inspection of a proposed dam site, would be visiting Hueco Tanks and other local sites
to assess their potential for state parks (El Paso Times, March 23, 1935). Following the tour, a regional
representative of the National Park Service (NPS) submitted a favorable report on the potential park
sites. By July 1935, the federal government revealed its negotiated price of $42,000 for four sections of
land in the Hueco Mountains and the Hueco Tanks property. NPS proposed to fund the Hueco Tanks
park and other new parks in the county through a maximum $0.03 levy on property values, depending on the outcome of a bond election the following month. The NPS representative also broached
the possibility of establishing a CCC camp as a base of operations for the men who would build the
infrastructure for these parks (El Paso Herald-Post, July 22, 1935). The park projects would provide
105

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

jobs for hundreds of unemployed young men and would be a boon to El Paso County, which was hit
hard by the Great Depression.
At a time when incomes were low and unemployment high, the price proposed by the Escontrias
family for nearly 3,000 acres at the center of their ranching operation was perceived as unreasonably
high by county residents and officials (El Paso Times, July 25, 26, 27, 1935). Volney Brown, attorney for
the Escontrias family, explained that Pilar Escontrias had no desire to sell the land, and had only offered
a price under pressure. Brown noted that sale of the Tanks would diminish the value of the surrounding
20 sections of grazing land, and require the building of a new ranch house (El Paso Herald-Post, July 30,
1935). The very waterholes that had been a public attraction for hundreds of years were also the heart
of the successful Escontrias grazing operation. The bond issue did not pass.
Another unrealized proposal for Hueco Tanks was floated during this time, to create a monument to
â460 years of pioneering in the Southwest, beginning with the visit of Cabeza de Vacaâ (El Paso Herald-Post,
May 9, 1935). Sculptor and promoter Gutzon Borglum, who had instigated work on Mount Rushmore
and Stone Mountain in Georgia, visited El Paso in August 1835 to channel Texas Centennial fervor into
a commission for a similar monument at Hueco Tanks. After he toured the Tanks in February 1936, Borglum pronounced that âThe Hueco Tanks formation is the only sound rock in this vicinity for carvingâ (El
Paso Herald-Post, February 11, 1936). The Escontrias family, owners of the rock hills, may never have been
contacted directly about Borglumâs proposal. Although Borglum was said to be working on a model for the
monument in May 1936 (El Paso Herald-Post, May 28, 1936), the project was never initiated.
Although the Tanks did not come into the public domain in the 1930s, visitors continued to access
the site as a recreational destination. A 1937 newspaper account noted that the property was fenced, and
that permission to enter the grounds could be obtained from the caretaker at the Escontrias ranch house
for a fee of 25 cents per person or 50 cents per car. Part of the Butterfield stage station was said to be
still standing, consisting of ârock walls, which are built under the cliff and which formed rooms for the
guards.â The article encouraged exploration of the tunnels and passageways in the rock formations, but
urged that âCaution should be observed by over enthusiastic climbers, as several casualties have resulted
due to not heeding this warningâ (El Paso Post, December 24, 1937).
Increasing numbers of visitors posed a threat to the archeological resources of Hueco Tanks and
nearby sites. In 1937, two El Paso boys on a picnic outing north of the Tanks collected a well-preserved
basket and its contents:
The basket, found in the rocks two miles north of the tanks, stands 15 inches high and
measures a foot at the base and about six inches at the top.
In the silt which half fills the basket were found ornaments made of a heavy bone; two
gourds, one small and the other quite large, having evidently been used for carrying water;
[and] a hand-made imitation of a snakeâs rattlers achieved with a round gourd containing
seeds (El Paso Times, February 23, 1937).
In the summer of 1939, avocational archeologist Forrest Kirkland and his wife spent 10 days studying and carefully recording the pictographs at Hueco Tanks (see Prehistoric Background). In Kirklandâs
estimation the images had sustained very little vandalism, but had faded due to weathering and blowing
sand. He noted that âJuan [Jim] Escontrias, who lives at the place and whose family has owned the site
for many years, shows a keen appreciation for its historic value and is to be commended for his intelligent supervision of the site as a private parkâ (Kirkland 1940:9-10).

106

Historical Background

In contrast to the well-preserved rock imagery, remains of the old stage station at Hueco Tanks had
deteriorated considerably. In the 1930s, historians examined the location where the Hueco Tanks station
had stood, and reported that ânothing remains but a rounded heap of adobe and gravel concealed in desert
undergrowth (Conkling and Conkling 1947:408). By 1940, the driving tour between Carlsbad, New Mexico
and El Paso in a WPA recreation guide had an entry for Hueco Tanks noting that admittance for camping
and picnicking could be obtained for 50 cents per car, but that âRuins of the Butterfield stage station here
have disappearedâ (Writersâ Program of the Work Projects Administration in the State of Texas 1940:666).
Within a few years after Kirklandâs visit to Hueco Tanks, World War II interrupted the pace of life
in El Paso. The cityâs role as a transportation hub, its farming and industrial capabilities, and its military
base at Fort Bliss caused El Paso to experience another boom during the war and in the years immediately following. Between 1940 and 1950, El Pasoâs population grew from around 131,000 to 195,000
(Bryson 1996:851). Both World War II and the Cold War era contributed to expansion of Fort Bliss, and
an increase in military personnel in the area.
By 1941, Fort Bliss Maneuver Area 2 had grown to cover more than 118,000 acres, bounded on the
north by the New Mexico state line, on the east by the Hudspeth County line, on the south by U.S. Highway 62, and on the west by Fort Bliss proper. This vast area was not owned by the government, but was
accessed through co-use lease agreements with landowners including the Escontrias family. When the
owners refused to renew the leases due to low rent, the government initiated condemnation proceedings in January 1942, and an agreement was reached that allowed military use of the Maneuver Area
by exclusive lease. Landowners retained the right to reside on their property and continue using it for
grazing and other purposes. By 1953, Pilar Excontrias [sic] was leasing 15,360 acres in Maneuver Area 2;
her ranch was the fourth-largest leased area, exceeded only by property held by Luis Navar, Fraser Burr
and Oliphant Jr., and the State of Texas (TLI Solutions, Inc. 2009:4-7 through 4-12).
In 1951, the Tanks were within a tactical maneuver area designated for strafing missions only. Military maps indicate that Landing Strip Number 3 had been built on the north side of Hueco Tanks by
1943 and remained in use through at least 1955. This type of training was documented in December
1950, when the post signal office photographed trainees from Headquarters Battery, 102nd Antiaircraft
Artillery Brigade in an antiaircraft emplacement that was located near the south side of North Mountain, based on distinctive rock formations in the background (Figure 22). Their Browning M2 .50 caliber
machine gun apparently was used to practice firing at targets towed by small planes that used the nearby
landing strip. Another photograph shows soldiers from A Battery, 2nd Training Battalion Antiaircraft
Artillery Corps and E Detachment 4052nd Search Unit carrying M1 .30 caliber rifles during night training at Hueco Tanks (TLI Solutions 2009:4-25 through 4-30).
Juan Ernesto Escontrias recalled that troops from Fort Bliss would come to the Tanks and camp for
days. They used the water sources for their horses and vehicles but left food and supplies behind, as the
process of accounting for materials brought back to the post at the conclusion of maneuvers apparently
was more cumbersome than leaving them for the ranchers (Escontrias and Escontrias 1996). Military
activities at Hueco Tanks may have continued as late as June of 1964, when all existing leases were terminated (Reza 1991; TLI Solutions 2009:4-13).

THE LAND DEVELOPMENT ERA, 1956-1965
Most of the new residents that streamed into El Paso in the 1950s settled in the rapidly expanding
suburbs east of the city. By the late 1950s, far-flung crossroads on the plain above the valley such as

Horizon City, and even the land surrounding Hueco Tanks, were sought for their development potential
in a booming real estate market. The growing population also sought recreational opportunities at places
like the Tanks, but the increase in visitation was accompanied by a rise in vandalism to the pictographs.
Organizations that supported conservation of El Pasoâs natural and historical resources became
alarmed at the increasing damage to the rock imagery of Hueco Tanks during the 1950s. In 1955, the
Texas Western College Kliff Klimbers and the El Paso Historical Society joined forces to erect signs at
sites E01A and E06 notifying visitors that the prehistoric rock imagery was valuable, and asking them
to not deface it (El Paso Times, December 13, 1955). Ramon Escontrias, in residence on the ranch,
apparently supported these efforts by allowing the signs to be posted. Historical Society member Dr.
Joseph Leach expressed concern about the destruction that had occurred since he last visited the site
in 1947:
âMany pictures have been almost completely obscured by persons who have written
their names on the walls and by the smoke from campfires built beneath themâ. . . .
âOne of the most flagrant crimes involved an impressive painting done in red, which
someone apparently chipped off the face of the rock. More recently, a remarkably distinct
picture of a snake some five feet in length, already defaced by persons scrawling their names
on it, was almost obliteratedâ (El Paso Times, December 13, 1955).
108

Historical Background

El Paso Historical Society president Paul Heisig wrote to the head of the State Parks Board, asking
how the Society could assist in placing Hueco Tanks under state supervision as a preserve or park (El
Paso Times, January 18, 1956). The Board responded that they could only purchase property when specifically authorized by the Texas Legislature (Camiade 1968). Greater pressures would soon affect the
ownership of this landmark.
After almost six decades, the Escontrias familyâs exclusive rights to raise stock at Hueco Tanks ended
in September 1955, when Ramon issued a one-year grazing lease to Jack Black and Ralph Gonzalez, Sr.
(El Paso County Deed Record 1251:312). Shortly after the lease ended, the familyâs ownership of Hueco
Tanks also came to a close when matriarch Pilar Loya Escontrias sold the 4 sections containing the
Tanks and 20 additional sections to James R. and Helen H. Davis on November 1, 1956 (El Paso County
Deed Record 1316:363; Texas General Land Office File 116725). Other Escontrias family members filed
suit over ownership of 6 of the sections, and litigation continued for several years (Texas General Land
Office File 116725).
By 1957, the Davises had started âsome what of a recreational center providing cabins, horseback
riding and other features for those visiting the areaâ (Camiade 1968), charging one dollar for each carload of visitors to the Tanks (El Paso Times, September 19, 1959). They hired Alex Candelaria to manage
the concern, hauled three old army barracks to the area north of the Escontrias house, and opened a cafÃ©
and bar for visitors (Miles 1984:69). German soldiers stationed at Fort Bliss for missile training were
among many who visited the Davisesâ recreational development (Figure 23).

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

At the same time, the significance of the cultural and natural resources of Hueco Tanks came to the
attention of El Paso State Representative Richard C. White, who championed its conversion into a state
park. On November 11, 1957, White introduced House Bill 47, authorizing the creation of Hueco Tanks
State Park. Emphasizing the rapid defacement of the pictographs at the Tanks, the bill was proposed as
an emergency measure, overriding the usual requirement for reading a bill on three successive days in
the House and Senate. The bill passed in both chambers, and Governor Price Daniel signed it the following day. Vernonâs Texas Civil Statutes, Title 103, Article 6077r authorized the state of Texas to accept
title to Hueco Tanks, subject to any reservations, conditions, or exceptions of the legal owner and with
the approval of the State Parks Board (Camiade 1968).
A delegation of El Paso citizens including White, Jack Salem (local television/radio news director)
and Bryce Lamment (city parks and recreation director) attended the State Parks Board meeting in
Austin on December 16, 1957. The El Paso contingent provided photographs and handouts to support
their case for the creation of Hueco Tanks State Park. White stated that funds were being raised by public subscription to buy the land comprising the Tanks, which would then be offered to the State. Salem
asserted that the proposed park would be practically self-supporting, noting that âthe present owner of
the land. . . containing Hueco Tanks charges $1 per car for admittance to the area, and as many as 400
cars have visited the area in one dayâ (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Minutes of the State Parks
Board, December 16, 1957).
While the Parks Board reacted favorably to the information on Hueco Tanks, they deferred a decision about accepting the property into the state park system, citing lack of development and operating
funds. On a more hopeful note, the Board suggested that âafter negotiations with the landowner had
crystallized, and after the preliminary phase of the program of acquisition had been completed, that it
would be happy to visit the area and officially announce its interest in order to aid the fund raising programâ (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Minutes of the State Parks Board, December 16, 1957). It
would take El Paso County eight years to secure the funds to initiate the purchase of Hueco Tanks, and
three more to complete the acquisition.
Aware that the Tanks had been authorized for acquisition as a state park, the Davis family retained
legal title to the property. In December 1958, they granted an undivided interest of $30,000 âwith love
and affectionâ to their children David D. Davis, Howard W. Davis, J. L. Davis, Jack R. Davis, and Helen
D. Smith (El Paso County Deed Record 1462:85). They also continued to exercise their options for making the desert ranch pay for itself. While they continued to operate Hueco Tanks as a recreational site, in
July 1959 the Davises sold the Continental Pipeline Company of Ponca City, Oklahoma a right of way
corridor on the northwest side of the Tanks (El Paso County Deed Record 1495:95, 125).
In the late 1950s the old Escontrias ranch house was damaged by a devastating fire, and then substantially remodeled (Bryan et al. 1999:29). The greatest changes were altering the flat roof to a low gable
roof and installing casement windows.
The Davises eventually were swayed by a generous offer, and in February 1960 sold some 24 sections of
land in and near the Tanks to C. E. Armstrong, president of Guaranty Title Company, Inc., via trustee Frank
Keton (El Paso County Deed Record 1527:593; El Paso Times, March 17, 1960). Armstrong said that the
buyers represented by Guaranty Title intended the purchase to be a long-term investment (El Paso Times,
September 19, 1959), but the group quickly aligned themselves with a land development firm. A lease
for part of Section 10 was issued to Mount Franklin Homes, Inc. in July 1960, and Gerald OâLeary soon
began site preparation for âHueco Tanks Trading and Amusement Centerâ (El Paso County Deed Record
1547:629). The project was envisioned to include a 200 acre lake (Figure 24), a resort hotel, and an 18-hole
golf course, serving as the hub of the surrounding Wilco Subdivision (El Paso Times, March 17, 1960).

Historical Background

Concerned citizens responded by petitioning county officials to save the historic landmark from the
bulldozer (El Paso Herald-Post, March 15, 1960). In a closed-door session, County Judge Woodrow Bean
and Gerald OâLeary reached a tentative compromise: Mount Franklin Homes would donate 300 acres
embracing the Tanks to the county, with the understanding that the parcel would be transferred to the
state for development as a park. Threatened with condemnation proceedings, OâLeary agreed to discuss
the proposal with his associates (El Paso Times, March 17, 1960). In exchange for the donation, Judge Bean
pledged that he would ask the county commissionerâs court to request that the state highway department
fund the construction of an 8 mile long paved road from Carlsbad Highway into Hueco Tanks on a 120
ft right of way donated by OâLeary. OâLeary freely admitted that the establishment of Hueco Tanks State
Park and construction of a paved road to the site would enhance the attractiveness of the remaining lots
that Mount Franklin Homes was marketing. He outlined his plans for the local newspaper:
âI am thinking of making the area even more attractive to visitors by completing the
lake on the side of the rocks opposite the old Hueco Tanks and stocking it with fish,â said
Mr. OâLeary. âWe are already down 300 feet with a well which is to be used to fill the lake. If
it is possible to do so I probably will include the lake in the tract to be donated for a State
Parkâ (El Paso Herald-Post, March 17, 1960).
The land donation never took place, though OâLeary and his group did manage to sell 4,000 lotsâ
many sight unseenâto buyers across the country. In March 1962, the 15,000 acre Mount Franklin
Homes development project was taken over by Hueco Park, Inc., headed by El Paso businessmen W. E.

Buchanan, Jr. and Leslie Hays. Water featured prominently in their plans, and they promised that âan
abundance of water will be providedâ to the development by gathering it in a reservoir, drilling wells, or
other means (El Paso Herald-Post, March 12, 1962). OâLearyâs group and/or Hueco Park, Inc. did build
a tall earthen dam between North and West Mountains, and diverted natural drainages into it with
the hope of creating a recreational reservoir (Miles 1984:69). The lake basin rarely held any amount of
water, however.
Between August 1963 and June 1964, a series of transactions conveyed partial interest in the Hueco
Tanks property to principals of the firm Edwards, Belk, Hunter, and Kerr (Bates Belk and Crawford S.
Kerr, Jr.), Guaranty Title (C. E. Armstrong and Frank Keton), Adolfo Del Hierro, and Bernard J. Wieland
(El Paso County Deed Records 1785:189; 22:1189, 1201, 1204; 251:312; Texas General Land Office School
File 116104). Wieland apparently obtained a controlling interest in the property, and played a key role
in the future of Hueco Tanks.
While the ownership of Hueco Tanks shifted rapidly, the landmark was acquiring a ârowdy, partytime reputationâ (Miles 1984:104). Collectors took ceramic sherds, and sometimes dug up entire pots
(Dallas Times Herald, May 23, 1982). In addition to family groups on picnic outings, soldiers from
nearby Fort Bliss frequented the Tanks during their off-duty hours. In 1964, an anonymous âwoman
pioneer of El Pasoâ complained to a newspaper columnist about the condition of the grounds, noting
that âthe place resembles a âgarbage dumpâ with cans, bottles, and other refuse all over it. . . . even the
Indian hieroglyphics were being marred.â The columnist declared that the site should be kept clean, and
the rock art preserved for posterity (El Paso Times, September 28, 1964).
By the fall of 1964, a private recreational park was being operated at the Tanks under a concession
held by Charley Duke of El Paso. Described as a ghost town, it included an âold fort-like structure,â
riding stables, and a restaurant (El Paso Times, October 4, 1964). A newspaper photograph shows two
large buildings (apparently the army barracks brought in by the Davises) and a shade shelter near the
two-room stone ruin west of the Escontrias ranch house (Figure 25a). Joachim Plath and friends (Figure
25b) were among the many German soldiers who visited Dukeâs ghost town while they were stationed at
Fort Bliss for missile training (Plath 2007).
Duke apparently leased the property at some point between March 1962, when Hueco Park, Inc.
obtained the property, and September 1964, when he filed a special warranty deed with Bernard J.
Wieland (Wieland 2007). Wielandâs group planned to test a well at Hueco Tanks to determine whether
it might be a reliable residential water source, and he promised to help Duke continue his horse rental
concession once his group took over operation of the Tanks (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department,
Warranty Deed). Wieland soon acquired a controlling interest in Hueco Tanks along with many other
tracts across El Paso County, and proceeded to promote their development.
Aware of public opinion as well as business opportunities, Wieland soon interested a religious
group in purchasing the Tanks. In October 1964, the Catholic Youth Organization of the El Paso Diocese announced plans to create a non-sectarian recreational retreat at Hueco Tanks. Director Reverend
James F. Madden noted that the âremoval of flimsy buildings erected during the time when a real estate
promotion was taking place is pendingâ (El Paso Times, October 6, 1964). It was anticipated that the
sales agreement would encompass 1,440 acres, including the rock formations, lake, and picnic grounds
(Southwest Catholic Register, October 16, 1964). Negotiations continued until February 1965, when
Madden announced that barriers to the purchase had been removed and that an El Paso consulting
engineer firm had been retained to supervise park development. Although Madden expressed a desire
to preserve the natural and cultural heritage of the site, preliminary plans depicted a town site, landing strip, and another lake, overlooked by a hotel perched atop North Mountain (Figure 26; El Paso

HeraldâPost, February 25, 1965). These plans were soon forestalled by renewed efforts to place Hueco
Tanks in the public domain.

THE PARK ERA, 1965 TO PRESENT
Local conservationists, weary of watching Hueco Tanks change hands among groups without concern for its cultural resources, rallied in 1965. On June 14, El Paso Historical Society president Gordon
Frost headed a delegation of prominent citizens who made a last-ditch appeal to the El Paso County
Commissioners Court to preserve the site for public use (El Paso Herald, June 14, 1965). The commissioners passed a resolution to purchase Hueco Tanks for use as a county park, until it could be transferred to the State of Texas. Bernard Wieland agreed to sell 737 acres to the county for $80,000, to be
paid in four $20,000 annual installments (El Paso County Commissionerâs Court 1965; El Paso County
Deed Record 78:103).
After the title to the property was cleared by Wieland, the land containing Hueco Tanks finally came
into the public domain when the transfer to El Paso County was completed on September 2, 1965 (El
Paso Herald-Post, September 2, 1965). Initially, Charley Duke continued to serve as caretaker and run his
concession. An inventory made at the time of purchase indicated that seven buildings were standing on
the property, most reported to be in very poor condition. These included a two-story barracks building
valued only for salvage, an adobe house (Escontrias ranch house), and horse sheds. Additional assets
were a 70 ft steel windmill tower, two railroad cars, corrals, water tanks, a 500 gallon butane tank, a drill
rig, a road grader, a built-in barbecue pit, cafÃ© equipment, and other items (El Paso Times, September
15, 1965).
In November 1965, the county commissioners court approved an agreement with Aurelio Navarro
to start âcleaning up the historical area and begin building a tourist attractionâ at Hueco Tanks County
Park. The concessionaire was required âto preserve the Indian pictographs on the walls of the tanks and
the Butterfield Trail stage station.â Navarro agreed to give El Paso County 50 percent of the admission
receipts and 15 percent of proceeds from other activities. The agreement was to run for 25 years, but
could be cancelled if the commissioners deemed that the operation was inefficient or unprofitable. At
the same meeting, commissioners called on the Texas Highway Department to pave and maintain a road
to Hueco Tanks (El Paso Times, November 9, 1965).
Operation of the new park was a matter of interest to many county residents. Professors from the
recently designated University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP; formerly Texas Western College) decided to
form the Hueco Tanks Advisory Committee. Led by chairman Rex Gerald, the seven men represented
the departments of biology, geology, sociology, and English. Their stated purpose was to provide input
on recreational and educational uses of the site. The groupâs primary recommendations were that the
natural environment of the park should be revitalized, and that historic and prehistoric activities that
had occurred there should be reconstructed through archeological investigations (Hueco Tanks Advisory Committee 1967:5-6).
While Hueco Tanks was coming into the public domain, the Tigua Tribe had been pursuing state and
federal recognition with the assistance of El Paso attorney Tom Diamond. In May 1967, the state formally
recognized the Tiguas as a Texas Indian Tribe through passage of House Bills 654 and 888, and placed
them under the trusteeship of the Texas Commission for Indian Affairs (Collins 1969:2; Griffin 1969:4).
In April 1968, President Lyndon Johnson signed Public Law 90-287, wherein the United States recognized
the âTiwa [Tigua] Indians of Ysleta, Texasâ and transferred responsibility for the tribe to the state of Texas.

115

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

In January 1968, the third of four payments needed to complete the purchase of Hueco Tanks had
been made by El Paso County, and anticipation began to build for conveyance of the property to the
state of Texas. Proponents including the Tiguasâ attorney Tom Diamond, UTEP professor Rex Gerald,
and State Senator Joe Christie recommended that Hueco Tanks County Park be conveyed to the state of
Texas and then given directly to the Tigua Tribe (Christie 1968; Diamond 1968; El Paso Times, January
30, 1968). The Texas Commission for Indian Affairs was concerned about the stateâs responsibility for
the poverty-stricken Tiguas, and supported transfer of the park to them as a source of income (Houston Post, February 11, 1968). On April 1, the El Paso County Commissioners Court passed a resolution
authorizing the county judge to convey the property known as Hueco Tanks to the state of Texas (El
Paso County Court, Court Records; El Paso County Deed Record 209:1028). The county commissioners
ended their existing agreement for the Hueco Tanks concession, and then authorized a concession with
the Tiguas through the Texas Commission for Indian Affairs, running from September 1, 1968 through
June 1, 1969 (Coldwell 1969; Griffin 1969:5).
The final $20,000 payment on the Hueco Tanks property was made to Bernard Wieland on January
12, 1969, and the lien was released on that date (El Paso County Deed Record 234:1638; El Paso Times,
January 19, 1969). Later in January, the legislature asked the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to
prepare a report and preliminary budget for operation and development of Hueco Tanks State Park.
According to Executive Director J. R. Singleton:
There, of course, are several alternatives; however, it appears that the Legislative and
budgetary intent is for the Departmentâs acceptance of this area as a State Park to be operated by a Departmental superintendent and supplemented by Tigua Indian employees or
a concession contract which would include operation and maintenance under our direct
supervision (Singleton 1969).
According to an El Paso newspaper account:
There will be $100,000 for hiring of personnel over the two-year period and it is expected that some Tigua Indians will be employed in the project, but the plan to turn Hueco
Tanks over to the Tiguas had to be shelved in the takeover. The tribe has another 100 [actually ca. 35] acres adjoining the site that it will be allowed to develop as it sees fit (El Paso
Times, June 13, 1969).
Formal transfer of Hueco Tanks to the state occurred on June 12, 1969, when County Judge Colbert
Coldwell signed the warranty deed conveying the 738.6 acres comprising the park to the state of Texas
(El Paso County Deed Record 254:274). The transfer had been postponed until errors in an earlier deed
had been resolved, and after the Legislature had authorized appropriations to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) to support development of the park (El Paso Times, June 13, 1969).
Hueco Tanks State Historical Park officially opened to the public on June 1, 1970. Facilities included
picnic tables and chemical toilets; visitors to the famous watering holes were warned to bring their
own water, as the lake had gone dry (El Paso Herald-Post, May 27, 1970). The first superintendent was
Danny Bedell. Park staff included ranger Larry Damron, who related that his main tasks were âcleaning
the park, repairing vandalism, and removing old structures not being usedâ (Mugno 1970:17). Another
priority was to remove twentieth-century graffiti (some offensive) from the rocks, using sandblasting
in some cases (Dallas Morning News, May 17, 1970). The majority of the park staff was from the Tigua

116

Historical Background

Tribe; seven tribe members were rangers, and Jose Sierra (who would later serve the Tigua as alguacil
(constable) and governor lived on the site as a full-time caretaker (El Paso Herald-Post, May 27, 1970;
Miles 2007; Mugno 1970:16).
The Tigua Tribe also owned property near the park. A 20 acre parcel that Horizon Properties Corporation had deeded to them in 1970 reportedly contained the remains of a prehistoric pueblo (Dallas
Morning News, May 17, 1970; El Paso Herald-Post, July 1, 1971). Another 15 acre tract adjoining the
northeast corner of the park was obtained by the Tigua Tribe early in 1971, when Bernard Wieland
donated it to the state of Texas, âacting through the Commission for Indian Affairs for the use and benefit of the Tigua Indian Communityâ (El Paso County Deed Record 336:119).
The facilities and acreage of the state park expanded in the early 1970s. As El Paso State Senator Joe
Christie pushed for funding of the new park, TPWD authorized $338,000 for the first phase of development, half of which came from federal sources for developing recreational facilities (El Paso Herald-Post,
December 1, 1970). This phase included construction of roads, picnic areas, camping areas, and utilities
(El Paso Herald-Post, July 26, 1973). On October 8, 1970, Bernard Wieland sold TPWD a 121.7 acre parcel contiguous with the state park; the L-shaped tract adjoined the north and west sides of the original
parcel, and brought the park to its present 860.3 acres (El Paso County Deed Record 333:356). A pipeline
easement that Wieland had sold to El Paso Natural Gas Company in 1968 crossed the south end of the
tract (El Paso County Deed Record 220:881).
Visitation was 4,733 during the seven months that Hueco Tanks State Historical Park was open in
1970, and rose to 7,002 in 1971, as reported by Superintendent Bedell. Access was improved in July 1971
when the road from Carlsbad Highway to the park was paved and designated as Ranch Road 2775 (El
Paso Herald-Post, July 1, 1971). In 1971, the state legislature appropriated $112,275 to build a new park
road and entrance (El Paso Herald-Post, July 1, 1971). Another $242,000 was allocated in 1972 for construction of a managerâs unit, restrooms, an entry station, water systems, and signage (El Paso HeraldPost, July 26, 1973).
Plans for yet another large-scale land development near Hueco Tanks were announced in December
1971. Hueco Estate Corporation, Inc. proposed to build a $3.5 million dollar theme park immediately
northeast of the state park. Castle Rock Recreational Park would feature a half-mile race track and
stables, a trailer park, a tent and campground area, a 115 acre lake with marina, a motel, and a restaurant
and lounge (El Paso Herald-Post, December 15, 1971). Like its predecessors, this ambitious development
never materialized.
Construction of facilities at Hueco Tanks State Historical Park continued into the mid-1970s,
despite setbacks due to weather and potential impacts to cultural resources. In 1972 and 1973, archeological excavations were conducted near the campground at the instigation of EPAS members, who had
discovered evidence of a prehistoric village there (Kegley 1982; see Prehistoric Background). In November 1973, the restroom facilities and some of the unpaved roads were flooded by unusually heavy rains.
TPWD announced plans for $200,000 of improvements to address the problem, including installation
of a water control system, and paving the roads from the entrance to the restrooms and picnic facilities.
As use of the park by rock climbers began to increase dramatically, plans also were made to set aside an
area where no vehicles would be allowed (El Paso Herald-Post, November 11, 1973). Superintendents
who directed operations at Hueco Tanks during this time of change were David Ferry, Pat Hull, Ernest
Tate, and Ross Hartnett.
Between 1973 and 1975, several proposals were floated for the state of Texas to acquire land around
Hueco Tanks to create a wilderness area. Representative James Kaster of El Paso introduced a bill to
the 1973 legislature calling for the state to make a land swap with Horizon Land Corporation; it was

117

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

approved by both chambers but vetoed by Governor Dolph Briscoe. In 1974, Texas Land Commissioner
Bob Armstrong proposed to make the trade under other authority, stating that âthere are nothing but
benefits to be gained.â By the time the State Land Board considered the proposal in October 1975, the
offer had changed to a trade of 4,604 acres around the park for 480 state-owned acres east of El Paso;
principal owner Bernard Wieland said it was âthe fulfillment of a 15-year dream for preserving the
Hueco Tanks areaâ (El Paso Times, April 7, 1973, June 8, 1973; February 21, 1974; El Paso Herald-Post,
October 22, 1975). The land swap did not occur.
Pressures from visitation continued to increase in the late 1970s. In January 1978, anthropologist
Kay Sutherland notified TPWD of impacts to archeology and rock imagery at the Tanks, and called for
increased protection and restricted access to areas with significant archeology and pictographs (Sutherland 1978). In March 1978, day use was limited to 500 vehicles âto prevent serious overcrowding of the
park facilities and to protect the valuable natural and historical resourcesâ (El Paso Herald-Post, March
23, 1978). Park officials attempted to reduce vandalism of the rock imagery by eliminating parking and
picnic areas near the most accessible sites, and installing thorny plantings below them; they also made
efforts to explain the significance of the pictographs to visitors (El Paso Herald-Post, April 19, 1978).
While applauding these actions, State Archeologist Curtis Tunnell urged TPWD to complete a baseline
inventory of the archeological sites and rock imagery in the park (El Paso Herald-Post, June 1, 1978). A
year later when Hueco Tanks was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places, UTEP archeologist Rex Gerald noted that the state had obtained âfairly good controlâ over vandalism at the site (El
Paso Times, May 27, 1979).
Vandalism rose again in the 1980s. In 1982, recently-appointed TPWD Superintendent Bob Miles
lamented that looting had been a continuing problem at Hueco Tanks State Historical Park, stating âWe
catch them once in awhile with metal detectors and sometimes shovels. Last year we found a fellow
and his daughter trying to break off one of the pictographsâ (Dallas Times Herald, May 23, 1982). The
individuals who attempted to remove part of rock imagery site N16C were cited, but charges were later
dropped because the county lost the paperwork (Travis 1982).
Competing interests involving the use of Hueco Tanks presented challenges for park management
during this period. One of these was sport climbing, which had begun as early as the 1950s when the
Texas Western College Kliff Klimbers frequented the Tanks. In 1958 and 1959, the legendary climber
Royal Robbins used ropes and bolts (called âtechnical climbingâ) to scale some of the tallest rock faces
in the park (Robbins 2002). After a gap of several decades, a resurgence of climbing at Hueco Tanks
began around 1975, when Mike Head, Dave Head, James Crump, and a few others pioneered new routes
with and without ropes and bolts, some as difficult as any in the country. Bob Murray began climbing at
the Tanks around 1980 and found many new and difficult boulder climbing routes (called âproblemsâ).
After Todd Skinner discovered the site in 1982, he publicized it widely to the climbing community.
In the mid- and late-1980s John Sherman was among the few serious boulder climbers at the Tanks,
establishing many new problems and developing the V system for rating their difficulty. Installation of
bolts for roped climbing was prohibited in 1986, but when Skinner and others continued to place unauthorized bolts, a three-week moratorium on roped climbing was declared. Boulder climbing increased
substantially in the 1990s, when Europeans like Fred Nicole and Elie Chevieux pioneered V13 and V14
problems (Crump et al. 1985:13; Jackson 2000; Sherman 1995:9-10, 20; Skinner 2002; Wilder 2004:3235). By the end of the 1990s Hueco Tanks had become a world-class boulder-climbing destination, and
annual visitation reached 140,000, more than triple the level of a decade earlier. Climbers remain the
largest user group to the present day.
Native American connections with the Tanks also continued. In March 1984, a delegation of Kiowa
and Tigua Indians visited the site and the cave in which the 1839 battle was believed to have taken place
118

Historical Background

(Miles 1984:66). Early in 1992, the Tiguas protested an international boulder-climbing competition
that was being held at the park, claiming that the activity was disrespectful and damaging to Tigua
culture and ancient Indian rock art. Elder Miguel Pedraza stated that the Tiguas considered the Tanks
to be sacred ground (Green 1974:66-68, 138-140), while John Sherman, organizer of the Rock Rodeo
Bouldering Competition, noted that climbers from all over the world also held the park sacred. Tigua
Governor Ray Apodaca said their protest also was intended to bring attention to the Tiguaâs demand to
return control of the park to the tribe (El Paso Times, May 1, 1992).
When graffitiâincluding gang territorial markingsâobscured some of the most significant rock
imagery in the fall of 1992, Superintendent Darrell Rhyne announced that TPWD was closing Hueco
Tanks to the public for two weeks. A public meeting was held to consider solutions for problems related
to visitor impacts and vandalism (El Paso Herald-Post, October 26, 1992; El Paso Times, November 15,
1992). The first steps toward development of long-range plans to curtail damage to natural and cultural
resources were taken in the mid-1990s, under superintendents Carolina Ramos and Warren Watson
(Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 1998:1).
In the late 1990s, the condition of the park again reached a crisis point. Superintendent Reynaldo
Sierra summarized the urgency of the situation: âWe just know that if things keep going the way they
have, in time, the graffiti, vandalism, and other degradation will ruin the parkâ (El Paso Times, June 12,
1998). Damage related to high levels of visitation included rogue trails and destruction of vegetation,
soil compaction and erosion, holes dug by pets, human waste in the backcountry, illegal night entry,
unauthorized camping in rockshelters, removal of closed-to-climbing signs, and disturbance to nesting
birds (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 1997:1, 9). To increase protection of the parkâs significant
cultural and natural resources, TPWD developed a draft public use plan and released it for public review
and comment in September 1997. A hearing was held in February 1998 to solicit input on the plan,
provided by a diverse array of park visitors including boulder climbers and other recreational users,
Native Americans, archeologists, biologists, state representatives, and state agency officials. TPWD held
additional work sessions with these constituents in the summer of 1998, and the revised public use plan
was implemented in September 1998 (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 1998). The plan strove to
balance outdoor recreation with resource conservation, calling for substantial reductions in visitation
levels while implementing a reservation system so visitors could ensure that they would be able to enter
the park. Visitors were required to receive an orientation on the significance and fragile nature of the
cultural and natural resources, and the laws that protect them. Over half of the park was set aside for
access by groups led by trained guides. Special use permits were made available for Native American
ceremonial and religious activities.
In conjunction with implementation of the public use plan, intensive inventories of the rock imagery (Rupestrian CyberServices 2000) and archeology (this report) were conducted in the spring of
1999. TPWD reviewed the condition of the park one year after the public use plan was implemented,
and found that graffiti and other vandalism had declined (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
2000:4), while awareness of the significance of the cultural and natural resources had increased, along
with support for the plan (Harry et al. 2001:157). Following another hearing in March 2000, a revised
public use plan was implemented in June of that year, and currently guides management of the park
(Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 2000). In January 2002 the legislature designated Hueco Tanks
and 33 other state historical parks as state historic sites, and in 2008 the park was renamed Hueco
Tanks State Park and Historic Site, in recognition of the multiple roles that this property plays in serving the citizens of Texas.

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

CONCLUSION
Hueco Tanks has drawn visitors to its natural cisterns and shaded rockshelters for more than 10,000
years. From prehistoric and historic Native Americans to the forty-niners enroute to California gold
fields to the Armendariz and Escontrias ranchers, they documented their sojourns at the Tanks with
over 3,000 pictographs and historic inscriptions. These ancient images have attracted curiosity seekers
and professional archeologists to the site for almost a century. Ultimately, damage to the fragile cultural
and natural resources prompted the movement for the state of Texas to preserve and protect the site.
Under the current management practices, visitors can learn about the history of human occupation at
this desert oasis and experience the wonder and beauty of its rugged rocks, while causing minimal damage to the historical and natural resources that comprise the uniquely significant legacy of Hueco Tanks
State Park and Historic Site.

METHODS OF ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

by Margaret Howard

In 1999 and 2001, an intensive pedestrian survey was conducted of the ca. 500 acres of level terrain
surrounding North Mountain, West Mountain, East Mountain, and East Spur (see Figure 2) at Hueco
Tanks State Park and Historic Site. This area covers 58 percent of the 860-acre state park, and was
selected for survey as it is most likely to experience ground-disturbing impacts from trail improvements
and visitor activities. The objectives of the survey were to (1) document and assess the nature, age, and
extent of cultural deposits; (2) determine the degree to which those deposits are threatened by foot
traffic, erosion, vandalism, and other impacts; (3) recommend management practices for protection of
the cultural deposits and features; and (4) gather information on prehistoric and historic occupation at
Hueco Tanks for public interpretation. The field strategy and methods of these archeological investigations are described in this section, along with the procedures used to include selected materials from
previous investigations in the analyses of materials recovered in 1999 and 2001.

RESEARCH AIMS AND DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY
The cultural deposits and features of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site contain significant
data that can expand current knowledge of prehistoric chronology, subsistence and settlement patterning, interaction, and historic occupation in the southern Jornada Mogollon area. These areas of
research were used to devise the data collection strategy for the current investigations, despite the limited potential for survey-level data to address these issues. To increase the size and information yield
of the database, selected materials from previous investigations were included in the current analyses
when they could be identified to specific localities (see below) and/or had the potential to address these
research aims.
Identification of the time spans of prehistoric occupations in the park was sought through artifact
identification and absolute dating. In the Jornada Mogollon area, ceramic types and, to some extent,
projectile point forms indicate the age of prehistoric cultural deposits. The most time-diagnostic attributes of projectile points are stem shape, stem width, and overall size, which allow them to be assigned
to broad periods (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:232-235; Roney 1985). For ceramics, decoration and rim
form are most indicative of particular types, styles, and date ranges (Miller 1995). During the current
investigations, all ceramic rim sherds, decorated sherds, projectile points, and projectile point stem fragments were collected, and selected time-diagnostic artifacts recovered in previous investigations also
were examined. Materials that are datable via radiocarbon assay like charcoal and plant remains were
collected from shovel tests during the current investigations, and gleaned from previous collections.
These data were used to address the following questions on chronology:

121

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

â¢ Which time periods appear to be represented in particular areas of the park?
â¢ Did occupational intensity across the park change over time?
â¢ Did the overall density of settlement change through time?
Data from Hueco Tanks are likely to contribute to the study of prehistoric subsistence and settlement in the southern Jornada Mogollon area, because dietary evidence often is preserved in rockshelters
and midden-stained sediments, both present at the Tanks. Information on subsistence was sought during the current investigations through collection of macrobotanical specimens like corn cobs, animal
bones and charcoal from shovel tests, and samples of midden-stained matrix that could contain pollen
and/or plant remains. Ground stone tools were collected so the size of their grinding surfaces could be
ascertained as a measure of maize dependence (Hard, Mauldin, and Raymond 1996). Sources of water
were mapped, because its availability probably influenced the use of particular areas at Hueco Tanks,
and the feasibility of agriculture. These data were used to address the following questions on subsistence
and settlement patterning:
â¢ Did year-round settlement occur in particular areas of the Tanks at any point in time?
â¢ Did agriculture ever comprise a significant part of the subsistence base?
â¢ Are occupations located near prehistoric dams during particular time periods?
Interaction within and beyond the southern Jornada Mogollon area is evidenced by nonlocal artifacts and raw materials, and stylistic influences on artifacts and rock imagery. Knowledge of the nature
and degree of these interactions has been advanced through artifact distribution analyses, refinement
of regional chronologies, and chemical source analyses (see Prehistoric Background section). Evidence
of interaction at Hueco Tanks was sought through collection of nonlocal ceramic and stone artifacts.
Obsidian also was collected even though it is available locally, because its source can be identified via
trace element analysis. Typological identification of ceramics was supplemented by chemical composition analysis of a sample of local and nonlocal sherds, and previous source data on ceramics from Hueco
Tanks were incorporated into the current study. Samples of ca. 30 pieces of debitage were collected from
each locality from shovel tests and (if necessary) dog-leash surface collection areas, to provide a quantitative (albeit limited) basis for discerning lithic procurement patterns. These data were used to address
the following questions on intraregional and interregional interaction:
â¢ What nonlocal contacts are evidenced by the artifacts?
â¢ What is the directionality of the trade network, and does it change over time?
â¢ Were ceramics produced in or near Hueco Tanks?
â¢ Were raw materials for stone tools obtained primarily from nearby sources, or elsewhere?
Historic accounts indicate European use of Hueco Tanks as early as 1692; it was initially a water
stop, then a stage station, a ranch, a military training ground, and finally a recreation area (see Historical
Background section). Material evidence of these occupations includes structures and ruins, historic
inscriptions, and time-diagnostic artifacts like ceramics and ammunition. These features were recorded

122

Methods of Archeological Investigations

and artifacts were collected during the current investigations to address the following questions on
historic occupation:
â¢ Which areas around Hueco Tanks were used most intensively during particular historic time periods?
â¢ Is the presence of native groups at the Tanks as reported in historic accounts evident in the archeological record?
â¢ Where were the Butterfield Overland Mail route and stage station located?
â¢ When and where did military training occur at Hueco Tanks?

PREFIELD PREPARATION
In preparation for the field survey, information was gathered on the archeological resources that
had been observed and/or recorded during previous investigations at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site. Considerable data were obtained in Austin from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
(TPWD) Cultural Resources Program files, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin, and the Office of the State Archeologist at the Texas Historical Commission.
Informants in Austin who were consulted regarding the archeology of Hueco Tanks included George
Kegley (formerly of TPWD), Kay Sutherland (St. Edwardâs University), Myles Miller (Geo-Marine, Inc.),
and Ronald Ralph (formerly of TPWD). Additional information was sought in El Paso at the Centennial
Museum of the University of Texas at El Paso, and the Wilderness Park Museum (now El Paso Museum
of Archaeology). Persons consulted in El Paso include Skip Clark and Carroll Hedrick (Texas Historical Commission stewards), Jim Bowman (Directorate of Environment, Fort Bliss), Victor Gibbs (GeoMarine, Inc.), Mike LaVerde (El Paso Archaeological Society), David Carmichael and John Peterson
(University of Texas at El Paso), and the staff of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site.
This research ascertained that all of the archeological resources in Hueco Tanks State Park and
Historic Site are subsumed under the trinomial 41EP2. Within this site, George Kegley had obtained
the trinomial 41EP33 for the Escontrias Ranch complex; in consultation with the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, this second trinomial has been retired, to retain one consistent designation for the
entire park. Cultural features within site 41EP2 were mapped by Mike Bilbo in 1977 through 1987 (Mike
Bilbo, personal communication 2009; Sutherland 1978:83). These data and other information collected
during prefield research were plotted on large-scale maps for use during the field survey.
In general, information from previous investigations and informants regarding Hueco Tanks State
Park and Historic Site and vicinity indicated that the cultural deposits on this property are highly visible,
exposed on the ground surface, in arroyo walls, and in disturbed areas. Gray midden-stained sediments
mark areas of intensive occupation. This information guided the selection of methods for locating and
recording the cultural resources of Hueco Tanks.

FIELD METHODS
Inventory-level survey of the ca. 500 acres of level ground in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic
Site was conducted during three periods: from April 6 to May 11, 1999; between July 13 and 20, 1999;

123

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

and from August 7 to 10, 2001. The survey was directed by Principal Investigator/Project Archeologist
Margaret Howard, and carried out by Assistant Project Archeologist Logan McNatt and crewmembers
Amy Ringstaff, Eric Morley (1999), and Luis Alvarado (2001). The survey crew was assisted by TPWD
personnel Tim Roberts, Wanda Olszewski, Hector Terrazas, and intern Lainie Batte, and Texas Historical
Commission steward Skip Clark. A total of 141 person-days were expended in these investigations, with
an effective rate of 3.5 acres surveyed per person-day of effort. The survey was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit 2150.
The field investigations were conducted by a four-person crew over 36 working days, and consisted
of three tasks: 1) intensive pedestrian survey of level areas, 2) reconnaissance of the lower elevations of
the rocks, and 3) recording and sample collection in areas defined as archeological localities (see below).
The first task was pedestrian survey of the relatively level area surrounding the rock hills on transect
intervals ranging from 20 to 30 m. The field crew reviewed informant and archival information before
they traversed each area, and efforts were made to relocate the features that had been reported there.
On each pedestrian transect, all places where the ground surface was visible were scrutinized, consisting
of areas lacking vegetation, eroded areas, animal trails and burrows, pedestrian trails, and roads. From
70 to 90 percent of the ground surface was exposed across the survey area. The density of artifacts on
the surface was noted along each transect. Time-diagnostic artifacts, nonlocal lithic materials, other
distinctive artifacts, fire-cracked rock and other features, and midden-stained sediments were flagged
for further recording.
To document the observations made along the pedestrian transects, crew members plotted their
lines of travel on base maps at a scale of 1 inch = 200 ft/61 m, and used pedometers and scales to record
the locations where they found high artifact densities, disturbance, features, and/or artifacts to be collected, using a standard notation. This information was transcribed onto a composite base map, and
archeological localities were delineated to encompass areas where the density of cultural materials and
features was relatively high (see below).
Pedestrian reconnaissance of the lower elevations on the rock hills was not planned initially, but was
instituted on the ninth day of fieldwork. This effort replaced a plan to record five previously reported
rockshelters by means of detailed maps and systematic probing of the depth of their deposits, although
two of those shelters were documented in that manner. It soon became apparent that the lower elevations
of the rock hills were replete with rockshelters (over 160 sheltered areas eventually were discovered), and
numerous other cultural features. The association of areas of intensive occupation with rockshelters,
rock imagery, and water sources on the rocks above them also was evident. Reconnaissance of the rock
hills to a height of at least 10 to 20 ft above the ground (when possible) was instituted with the aim of
mapping cultural features and natural resources like water channels. This task was conducted by one to
two persons and could not be done systematically, due to the intricate and sometimes precipitous nature
of the terrain. Features recorded on the lower elevations of the rock hills included rockshelters enclosing
areas of at least 10 square m (containing or lacking sediments), rock imagery, bedrock grinding features
(mortars, cupules, and metates), water retention features, natural water chutes (marked by stains), and
packrat middens. Although an effort was made to locate all relevant cultural and natural features, the
survey of the lower rocks was a reconnaissance. A complete survey of the rock hills at Hueco Tanks can
only be achieved over the long term, due to the complexity of the rock surfaces and the fact that a good
part of the rock imagery and other features are only visible under certain conditions (e.g., dim morning
light in spring, via crawling into a crack on oneâs back, etcetera).
The third task of the fieldwork was intensive survey, recording, and sample collection in areas with
moderate to high surface artifact densities, which were designated as archeological localities within
site 41EP2. The concept of locality as applied here is âthe smallest unit of area ordinarily dealt with
124

Methods of Archeological Investigations

in archeology, varying in size from a single site to a district of uncertain sizeâ (Phillips and Willey
1953:618). Although many of the archeological localities at Hueco Tanks have contiguous boundaries,
they could have been recorded as individual sites had site 41EP2 not already encompassed the entire
park. Locality boundaries delineate areas where artifact densities exceed 1 item per square m, based on
qualitative assessment (Whalen 1994:29). They include cultural deposits of a consistent density and
type, but in areas where the cultural deposits are extensive, locality boundaries were arbitrarily set at
natural and/or constructed landmarks, to create smaller units for analysis and management. The 29
localities recorded during the current investigations are numbered sequentially within six geographic
areas (Figure 27) designated by prefixes: CA â Central Area; ES â East Strip; NE â Northeast Area; NW
â Northwest Area; SB â South Basin; WS â West Strip. Their extent ranges from 1 to 25 acres. Locality
boundaries are not shown in this report, to protect those areas from vandalism.
Documentation of each archeological locality focused on obtaining an estimate of its extent, depth,
age, features, and integrity. The degree of threat from erosion, vandalism, and/or other causes also
was assessed. To obtain this information, localities were re-surveyed on pedestrian transects spaced
at intervals of 10 m or less, and the ground surface and all exposed areas were scrutinized intensively. Each locality was recorded on a standard form modeled on the State of Texas Archeological Site
Data Form. Black-and-white photographs and color slides were taken. Locations of artifacts that were
collected, shovel tests, artifact concentrations, midden-stained sediments, bedrock grinding features,
rockshelters, rock imagery, water retention features, and other cultural features were plotted using
compass and pace. Base maps were derived from detailed topographic maps of the park prepared by
Williams-Stackhouse, Inc. of San Antonio from aerial photographs taken in January 1970, and plotted at two scales. Small scale base maps (1 inch = 200 ft/61 m, 10 ft contour interval) were used for a
few localities with little internal detail and minimal features, while large-scale base maps (1 inch = 100
ft/30 m, 2 ft contour interval) were used for most of the localities, to clearly show areas where cultural
materials and/or features are clustered.
Within each archeological locality, the cultural features on the level terrain were photographed and
described. Prehistoric feature descriptions included dimensions north-south and east-west, shape, constituents (e.g., rock type) and density, associated cultural items (defined as being within 1 m of the feature), apparent integrity and degree of threat, and comments. An exception was made at locality WS2,
where the 76 fire-cracked rock features were mapped and photographed, but due to time constraints, a
sample of 15 of those features that were relatively intact were described. Historic structures and water
retention features were photographed, measured, and described in a similar manner. Because the rock
imagery was mapped and photographed during a concurrent survey by Rupestrian Cyberservices, it
was not documented. Human remains were discovered at one location, but were left undisturbed and
covered with clean fill, in accord with the TPWD Policy on the Treatment of Human Remains (1999).
Artifact collections were made in accord with the research aims and data collection strategy (see
above). All time-diagnostic artifacts that were evident on the ground surface were collected, consisting of dart and arrow points, prehistoric ceramic rim sherds, and decorated prehistoric and historic
ceramics. All visible ground stone tools and one macrobotanical specimenâa corncobâwere collected
to obtain information on subsistence. Chipped stone artifacts that might evidence interaction were collected, specifically items made of nonlocal stone and obsidian. Unique and/or distinctive artifacts like
perforated ceramic disks were collected. All of the artifacts in locality NW4 (400+ ceramic sherds and a
few chipped stone artifacts) were collected, because they appeared to represent a short-term event. Collected artifacts or group of artifacts were designated sequentially within localities, for example: NE1-1
is an obsidian flake, NE1-2 includes a projectile point and a decorated rim sherd, and NE1-3 designates

Methods of Archeological Investigations

One to two shovel tests were dug in each archeological locality to sample the depth, stratigraphy,
and integrity of the cultural deposits, and to collect debitage and sediment samples. When possible,
shovel tests were placed in artifact concentrations and/or midden-stained sediments that had the potential to contain high densities of debitage, datable materials, and/or macro- and microfloral remains. Two
shovel tests were dug in localities CA4, ES1, NE4, SB6, and WS2 because the targeted quantity of debitage (ca. 30 specimens) was not obtained in the initial test. Rockshelter deposits were not sampled by
shovel tests due to their great number, and also because they could contain human graves; no testing was
conducted at locality NE3, the reported location of a human grave. Shovel tests were rectangular and
typically measured 25 by 45 cm; the matrix was removed in 10 cm levels and screened through Â¼ inch
mesh hardware cloth. The tests were dug until they hit caliche or dense gravels; many reached depths of
70 to 100 cm before they were ended due to difficulty of digging, or cave-in of the loose sandy sediments.
The depths of the artifacts recovered from shovel tests are somewhat imprecise, because a few items may
have been introduced into lower levels when overlying sediments were inadvertently knocked down
during excavation. All of the artifacts encountered in shovel tests were collected, as well as any datable
organic materials like charcoal. The latter was picked up with tweezers and wrapped in aluminum foil,
and the context and associations of each sample were recorded on standard forms. Fire-cracked rocks,
charcoal from modern camp fires, and other materials of recent origin like pull tabs, crown caps, and
cigarette butts were noted on shovel test forms but not collected. The 33 shovel tests were numbered
sequentially; their stratigraphy and the materials recovered were recorded on standard forms. Munsell
color readings (Munsell Color Company 1990) were taken on midden-stained sediments.
Debitage samples consisting of at least 30 specimens were sought from each locality by digging one
to two shovel tests. If two tests did not yield enough debitage, the sample was augmented by a surface
collection centered on a shovel test and measuring from 1 to 3 m in diameter; the size of the collection area was expanded in meter increments until the requisite number of flakes was obtained. These
âdog-leashâ samples were collected at seven localities: CA6, ES1, ES2, SB5, SB6, WS3, and WS4. All of
the artifacts encountered in dog-leash sample areas were collected, including items other than debitage.
In pursuit of subsistence information, paired pollen and flotation samples were collected from midden-stained sediment exposed in the profiles of shovel tests at 11 localities: CA1, CA2, CA3, CA5, CA7,
NE1, NE2, NW1, NW2, SB1, and WS2. After the walls of each shovel test wall were scraped, trowels
cleaned with distilled water were used to collect sediment for pollen analysis (150 ml) and flotation (at
least 2 liters); these samples were double bagged and recorded on standard forms. By necessity, these
matrix samples were collected during windy conditions in April and May of 1999.
At the conclusion of the field investigations, the 29 locality polygons for Hueco Tanks State Park
and Historic Site were transferred to a secured data layer in the TPWD Geographic Information System
database. Abbreviated versions of the locality forms were filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin. The complete locality forms, daily journals, shovel test and
sample records, artifacts, and unprocessed samples from the 1999 and 2001 investigations are curated at
the TPWD Archeology Laboratory in Austin.

INCLUSION OF PREVIOUS COLLECTIONS
Selected artifacts and samples from previous investigations at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic
Site were examined in conjunction with analyses of materials recovered during the current investigations. They were incorporated into the current analyses to improve age estimates for the localities,
include rare artifact types, and characterize subsurface cultural deposits in areas that are otherwise
127

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

poorly known. These artifacts and samples were drawn from two collections: (1) items collected from
the ground surface by park visitors and staff, herein termed the park collection; and (2) collections from
investigations conducted in the early 1970s at Hueco Tanks Village and in other areas of the park.
Park Collection
Due to the high visibility of artifacts on the ground surface at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic
Site, items have been picked up and brought to the park office by well-meaning visitors, volunteers, and
TPWD staff since the park opened in 1970. Items collected before the park was established also have
been returned. The locations where many of these specimens were found were recorded on envelopes,
bags, and park maps, or through reference to nearby landmarks. In the early 1980s, the use of cards for
recording artifact provenience at Hueco Tanks (Figure 28) was instituted by TPWD Natural Resources
Program Director David Riskind, modeled on the system for recording plant specimens in the park. The
locations of over 400 artifacts were documented on these information cards or by other means; nearly
half of them are prehistoric ceramic sherds (n = 187), and almost one-third are projectile points or fragments (n = 114), with historic artifacts a distant third. When the provenience information for an artifact
was sufficiently precise, it was assigned to a current archeological locality. Provenienced specimens that
address the research aims of the current investigations (see above) were included in the current analyses
of materials recovered (see Materials Recovered section).
Artifacts from the park collection were assigned to localities by several methods. Artifact information cards or park maps with plotted find locations were compared to an archeological locality map,

Figure 28. Hueco Tanks artifact information card (find location deleted).

128

Methods of Archeological Investigations

and attributed to a locality if they were within its boundary. When find locations fell on the boundary
between two localities the artifact was considered to be unprovenienced, with the exception of two
Paleoindian projectile points that, due to their rarity, were attributed to both localities and included
in the analyses. When the artifact plotting was outside but within 100 ft of a locality it was included in
that locality, but if fell within 100 ft of two localities it was considered to be unprovenienced. When an
artifact was reportedly found near a designated rock imagery panel, the location of that panel was used
to assign it to an archeological locality. With the exception of a few rare items, artifacts that could not
be assigned to localities through these methods were returned to Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic
Site for use in park interpretation.
Two individuals are responsible for many of the provenienced items in the park collection. John
Davis, an El Paso Archaeological Society member who studied and reported on the archeology of Hueco
Tanks in the early 1970s (see Prehistoric Background section), amassed a small artifact collection from
locations across the park. Davis used index cards and envelopes to note the places where most of the
items were found, relating them to nearby rock imagery or plotting them on a sketch of the rock hills.
After Davis passed away, this collection was donated to Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site by his
wife Marguerite and son Jerry.
Over half of the items in the park collection that could be identified to provenience were collected
by volunteer guide David Breitegan of El Paso between 1990 and 1998, and documented on artifact
information cards. Many of the artifacts were found while he was picking up modern refuse at the park
(Breitegan 2008). The items are predominantly chipped stone tools, though Breitegan also found many
prehistoric ceramic sherds.
In general, the provenienced artifacts in the park collection come from areas that have experienced
high levels of pedestrian traffic. CA7 is the leading locality, followed by CA5, CA6, NE1, and NW1; most
of these localities are in areas of the park that currently are accessible on a guided basis only. Although
the provenienced specimens in the park collection are not documented to the highest archeological
standard, they still provide information on the human history of Hueco Tanks.
Collections from the Early 1970s
The artifacts, samples, and records from TPWD excavations at Hueco Tanks Village in 1972 and
1973 (Kegley 1980, 1982) were held in the Archeology Laboratory at TPWD until 1994. They were
placed temporarily at Fort Bliss in El Paso for use in the Fort Bliss Chronometric and Relative Chronology Project (DeGarmo 1994; Miller 1996b-f), and then conveyed to the Sociology and Anthropology
Department of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) in 1995. In 2008, the Centennial Museum
at UTEP agreed to curate these materials in perpetuity. Because the collection was in disarray and its
packaging had deteriorated, TPWD entered into an agreement with Centennial Museum to reorganize
and repackage it, and create a digital inventory, prior to accession and curation of the collection at the
Museum.
In the course of this work, additional materials were discovered that had been stored with the large
Hueco Tanks Village collection. These include artifacts from test units dug at two locations (in current
localities CA2 and NE4) by the TPWD crew in 1972, but not described in the Hueco Tanks Village
reports (Kegley 1980, 1982). Artifacts and notes from test excavations in the crevice that contains rock
imagery site W36 (Davis 1972c) also were found, as well as a few items collected from the park by El Paso
Archaeological Society members and others.

129

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Although these previously unreported materials were not analyzed fully in conjunction with the
current investigations (i.e., reported in the Materials Recovered section), their inventory and accessibility for examination allowed for selective incorporation of aspects of these collections into this report.

FEATURES, STRUCTURES, AND DISTRIBUTIONS

by Margaret Howard

Data on features, structures, and artifact distributions were collected during the current investigations to address questions on chronology, subsistence, settlement patterning, interaction, and historic
occupation at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site. Findings from previous investigations also are
incorporated into this section. This information is analyzed and compared to similar data from the
southern Jornada Mogollon area. In conjunction with the materials recovered and rock imagery, the
significance of the Hueco Tanks features, structures, and artifact distributions will be interpreted in the
Research Findings section of the report.
The main units of comparison are the 29 archeological localities defined within the 860-acre area
that comprises Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site, as well as archeological site 41EP2. The localities range from less than 1 to 25 acres in extent, encompassing cultural deposits of consistent density and
type, and bounded arbitrarily at natural and/or constructed landmarks (see Methods of Archeological
Investigations). In examining the distribution of features and artifacts, locality size was considered but is
rarely presented here, as most of the patterns found are so robust that they are unaffected by the diverse
sizes of the localities.

PREHISTORIC FEATURES
The prehistoric features recorded during the current investigations are fire-cracked rock accumulations, areas of midden-stained sediment, bedrock grinding features, rockshelters, dams, and human
graves (Table 8). One or more of these features was found in every locality except NW4, SB7, and WS4.
Bedrock grinding features (mortars, metates, and cupules) are the most numerous type of prehistoric
feature, and are present at just over half of the localities. The most ubiquitous prehistoric features are
rockshelters, which are associated with almost three-fourths of the localities. Prehistoric dams are least
numerous (see Table 8). Data on prehistoric features recorded during the current investigations were
gleaned from field records and tabulated by Logan McNatt.
Fire-Cracked Rock Features
Prehistoric fire-cracked rock features are not evenly distributed across Hueco Tanks State Park
and Historic Site. Based on surface evidence, 125 fire-cracked rock features were identified on 11 of
the 29 archeological localities (see Table 8). Ninety percent of these features are concentrated in four
localities; the largest group is in WS2 and encompasses 76 features, comprising 61 percent of the total.
To the south are 14 fire-cracked rock features in SB6 and 13 in SB5; on the northwest, 9 fire-cracked

rock features were found in NW2. The remaining 13 fire-cracked rock features are distributed across
seven localities. ES1 reportedly encompassed 15 fire-cracked rock features before that area was disturbed by construction of park facilities (Bilbo 1972b:1-2), but only 2 of them were located during
the current investigations.
In the four localities where visible fire-cracked rock features are most numerous, the degree of spatial clustering varies considerably. At SB6 they are widespread: 12 of the 14 features fall within a 250 by

132

Features, Structures, and Distributions

50 m area, with a spacing of ca. 1,042 square m per feature on average. Clustering is greater in NW2,
where the 9 fire-cracked rock features are arrayed along a drainage within an area measuring 120 by 40
m, with an average spacing of 533 square m per feature. The greatest degree of clustering was found in
SB5 and WS2; 11 of the 13 features in SB5 fall within a 35 by 55 m area, averaging 175 square m per feature. A similar density was found in WS2, where 63 of the 76 fire-cracked rock features are concentrated
in an area measuring 230 by 50 m, with 183 square m per feature on average.
Most of the fire-cracked rock features (n = 90, 72 percent) are located within 100 m of the rock hills
and the water sources they contain, while 33 (28 percent) are distant from the hills but near ephemeral
drainages. Only two fire-cracked rock features are located far from both rock hills and drainages. The
proximity of almost all of these features to water sources suggests that ready access to water was related
to their use.
Attributes of fire-cracked rock features were recorded during the current investigations by means
of visual examination, and include dimensions, estimated percentages of constituent rock types (limestone and porphyritic syenite, termed syenite in this discussion for simplicity), and associated artifacts
(defined as being within 1 m of features). These data were recorded for all fire-cracked rock features in
every locality except WS2, where time constraints limited detailed recording to 15 features that appeared
to be mostly intact (20 percent of the total); dimensions of the remaining 61 features were estimated
from photographs. Overall, the full set of attributes is available for 64 (51 percent) of the 125 visible firecracked rock features at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site (Table 9). None of the features were
excavated, with the exception of a shovel test dug through Feature 10 in SB6.
The two types of rock that comprise these features are available locally and in abundance. Syenite
comes from the rock hills of Hueco Tanks. The Hueco Mountains to the east are a source of limestone;
alluvial fans from this range blanket the areas around the Tanks, and contain limestone gravels (Collins

and Raney 2000). The relative proportions of these rocks were recorded to assess whether rock type was
related to feature size and purpose. Rocks differ in their capacity to retain heat and withstand fracturing;
igneous rock can be used in earth ovens to roast sotol for around 10 firings, while limestone serves for
only 4 firings before breaking up (Tunnell and Madrid 1990:154). Stone boiling experiments indicate
that limestone retains heat longer than rhyolite (Mauldin et al. 1998:436-439).
Syenite comprises the majority of the fire-cracked rock features at the Tanks, although considerable quantities of limestone also were used. Among the 64 features where rock type was recorded, half
are more than 80 percent syenite while only one-third are over 80 percent limestone (see Table 9). The
predominant use of syenite from the nearby rock hills at the Tanks is no surprise. Use of limestone as
the primary rock is limited to features in NW2, SB5, and SB6, which are located near major drainages
on alluvial fans containing limestone gravels. There is no indication that limestone was taken any great
distance from the fan channels. Hence, the stones that comprise the visible fire-cracked rock features at
Hueco Tanks were selected on the basis of their availability. Expedient use of available stone has been
observed in the southern Jornada Mogollon area at sites including Keystone Dam 33 and 34 in the
Franklin Mountain foothills, where the types of stones composing small and large fire-cracked rock features were similar to those found in nearby gravel deposits (OâLaughlin 1980:101-105, 115). Similarly,
Tennis et al. (1997:16-18, 51) determined that fire-cracked rock features on alluvial fans near a Hueco
Mountain outlier were predominantly composed of limestone, while similar features in basin areas
located 1.5 km distant from those rock sources were composed largely of caliche.
A wide range of sizes is represented by the visible fire-cracked rock features at Hueco Tanks, probably indicating diverse functions. Feature size was assessed on the basis of surface evidence; the precision of these measures is limited by the condition of the features, many of which have been dispersed
(expanded) and/or eroded (reduced). Nevertheless, the 125 measured features (including 61 from
WS2 that were measured on photographs) were divided into four classes based on maximum observed
dimension; features from each size class are shown in Figure 29.
Over three-fourths of the 125 fire-cracked rock features at the Tanks are less than 1.5 m in maximum dimension (see Figure 29a) and this size of feature also is the most widespread, represented at 10
of the 11 localities (see Table 9). Three of these small features that have been cross-sectioned by erosion are shallow rock-lined basins ranging from 13 cm (WS2 Feature 14) to 20 cm (SB5 Feature 11) to
26 cm deep (CA4 Feature 1). In the southern Jornada Mogollon area, small fire-cracked rock features
with shallow basins commonly are considered to be hearths used for general purposes like cooking and
heating (Carmichael 1985a:101, 141; Church et al. 2009:8-54; Hard 1983b:50-51; Miller 1989:94-95;
Wetterstrom 1980:26; Whalen 1977:159, 164). The abundance and widespread distribution of the small
fire-cracked rock features at Hueco Tanks are in accord with this interpretation.
Sixteen percent of the measured fire-cracked rock features fall between 1.5 and 2.9 m in maximum
dimension (see Figure 29b). Features in this size class were found at six localities, with the greatest numbers in SB5, SB6, and WS2 (see Table 9). Hard (1983b:50-51) has suggested that fire-cracked rock features 1.5 m in diameter or larger that contain substantial quantities of rock represent plant roasting pits.
The two classes of large fire-cracked rock features comprise 8 percent of the sample, and those features are concentrated in the southwest part of the park in SB5 and SB6, with single examples in SB4 and
WS2 (see Table 9). Agave plants also are common near the south park boundary, growing on relatively
moist Mimbres soils (see Environmental Background). If a similar agave patch existed in this area in
prehistoric times, these features could have been agave roasting pits. A particularly likely candidate is
Feature 10 in SB6, which covers a 3.7 by 2.6 m area and contains a central concentration of rocks measuring 1.6 by 1.2 m, adjoined by two smaller rock piles (see Figure 29c). It resembles features at Castner

Range that are suspected to be leaf succulent roasting pits, flanked by small hearths that apparently were
used to heat the rocks (Hard 1983b:23-27; 51-52).
The three fire-cracked rock features that comprise the largest size class (see Table 9) are significantly
bigger than the others. Feature 53 in WS2 (see Figure 29d) covers an 8 by 4.5 m area, but apparently
consists of several smaller features commingled by erosion. Feature 2 in SB5 is a diffuse scatter of firecracked rocks measuring 7 by 2 m, and probably originated as a smaller feature that was dispersed
broadly. Feature 1 in SB4 is the largest visible fire-cracked rock feature at Hueco Tanks, covering 11 by
4 m and approaching the size of ring middens at the nearby Powwow Site, which were 6.7 to 11 m in
diameter (Greer 1968:113). The high density of fire-cracked rock and gray matrix of Feature 1 suggest
that it is a ring midden; it lacks the central basin of the middens at Powwow and other sites, but its basin
could have been destroyed by a trail that cut through it.
Although the type of stone used in the visible fire-cracked rock features at Hueco Tanks is strongly
conditioned by the most readily available source (see above), there is some correlation between rock
type and two of the feature size classes (Figure 30). Over two-thirds of the features less than 1.5 m in
maximum dimension are composed almost entirely of syenite, while 86 percent of the features between
3 and 4.4 m in maximum dimension are over 80 percent limestone. In terms of number, limestone is
represented equally in three of the four size classes, while syenite dominates the smallest fire-cracked
rock feature size class. If features of particular sizes served different purposes as surmised above, the
large fire-cracked rock features at Hueco Tanks may be earth ovens built of limestone due to its capacity
to retain heat, in locations where that rock could be obtained easily.

Features, Structures, and Distributions

Age of the 64 recorded fire-cracked rock features (see Table 9) is estimated from the date ranges of
artifacts observed within 1 m, and one radiocarbon assay on charcoal from the shovel test in Feature 10
at SB6. On this basis, almost half of the fire-cracked rock features can only be dated to the Prehistoric
period due to the presence of debitage alone, and 9 percent cannot be dated because no artifacts were
found near them. Formative period (A.D. 200 to 1450) use is evident at 27 (42 percent) of the features
where ceramics were found nearby; 19 (30 percent) of them are associated with plain El Paso brownware body sherds and cannot be dated more precisely. Eight fire-cracked rock features (13 percent) can
be assigned to particular Formative time periods, most on the basis of associated ceramics. An El Paso
Brown rim sherd (A.D. 200/600 to 1000/1100) places Feature 1 at NW1 primarily in the Mesilla phase.
A radiocarbon assay (A.D. 980 to 1140; see Appendix B) dates Feature 10 in SB6 to the early DoÃ±a Ana
phase, and an El Paso Polychrome sherd (A.D. 1000/1100 to 1450) recovered from the same shovel test
overlaps that time range. Presence of El Paso Polychrome, Playas Red (A.D. 1200 to early 1500s), Three
Rivers Red-on-terracotta (A.D. 1150 to 1300), and/or Chupadero Black-on-white (A.D. 1050 to 1500s)
ceramics dates six features to the DoÃ±a Ana and/or El Paso phase: Features 5, 8, and 13 at SB5, and Features 2, 7, and 11 at SB6.
Three radiocarbon assays on samples from shovel tests within 15 m of fire-cracked rock features
provide additional information on their likely ages (see Appendix B). The cluster of 63 features in WS2
is estimated to date to the end of the Late Archaic period based on radiocarbon assays on charcoal from
two shovel tests, one within 1 m of three features and the other within 15 m of two features. Although
the tests were located 50 m from each other, the time spans of the assays are identical (10 B.C. to A.D.
140). The shovel tests encountered no ceramics, and one produced an untyped dart point. The possible
ring midden in SB4 is estimated to date to the Protohistoric and/or early Historic period, based on
radiocarbon assays on charcoal from a shovel test within 5 m of it. Although one sample had a modern
date, the other had multiple time ranges, two of which bracket a period from A.D. 1650 to 1820 (see
Appendix B).
Age and size are correlated among the visible fire-cracked rock features at Hueco Tanks that can
be associated with particular time periods. The small features in WS2 that date to the end of the Late
Archaic period are less than 1.5 m in maximum dimension. Another small feature in NW1 dates primarily to the Mesilla phase. Dating to the DoÃ±a Ana and/or El Paso phase, two features at SB5 measure
1.5 to 2.9 m in maximum dimension and a third is less than 1.5 m. Four features in SB6 that are 3 m
or larger date from the early DoÃ±a Ana phase to the DoÃ±a Ana and/or El Paso phase. The possible ring
midden in SB4 measures 11 by 4 m and appears to date to the Protohistoric and/or early Historic period.
The trend at Hueco Tanks parallels the increase in size over time found in a region-wide sample of firecracked rock features dated via radiocarbon assay (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:250-251); the use of small
features declined near the end of the Mesilla phase, while larger features (greater than 1 m in maximum
dimension; Myles Miller, personal communication 2008) continued in use during the DoÃ±a Ana phase.
The El Paso phase saw a decline in use of all sizes of fire-cracked rock features (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:251).
Plant remains recovered from fire-cracked rock features in the southern Jornada Mogollon area
provide some support for the widespread assumption that large fire-cracked rock features are pit ovens
for roasting agave, sotol, and/or yucca (e.g., Hard 1983b:49-52; OâLaughlin 1980:30, 118; 2001:264-265;
Tennis et al. 1997:51-52). Charred yucca and sotol leaf and stem fragments were recovered from firecracked rock features on Otero Mesa and Castner Range (Dering 2002; Hard 1983b:81-82). Agavaceae
remains were found in most of the macrobotanical samples from pithouses at the Gobernadora and
Ojasen sites (Shafer et al. 1999:305-307), although two rock-lined pits at the sites produced large numbers of amaranth, cactus, and mesquite seeds (Miller 1989:132, 212-213, 218-221, 260). Numerically,

137

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

the most abundant plant remains recovered from rock-lined pits in the region are seeds from prickly
pear, hedgehog cactus, and datil yucca (Church et al. 2009:8-57), but the seeds and fruit of these plants
can be eaten raw (Tull 1987). Logically, the plants most likely to have been roasted in rock-lined pits
are the hearts of agave, sotol, and yucca, which are indigestible until they have been roasted for 36 to
48 hours (Dering 1999:661; Tull 1987). This issue was not addressed during the current investigations,
as the faintly-stained sediments in fire-cracked rock Feature 10 at SB6 were judged unlikely to preserve
macrobotanical remains, and were not collected.
To recap, visible fire-cracked rock features in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site are present
on about one-third of the localities, and are concentrated in WS2, SB6, SB5, and NW2. Water played
some role in their use, based on the proximity of most of these features to water sources. Syenite from
the rock hills was used in most features, while limestone comprises the majority of large fire-cracked
rock features near alluvial fan channels.
Small (less than 1.5 m in maximum dimension) fire-cracked rock features constitute over threefourths of the sample and are widespread. They probably were hearths used for general purposes like
cooking and heating, and over two-thirds of them are composed almost entirely of readily available
syenite. One small isolated fire-cracked rock feature in NW1 dates to the Mesilla/early DoÃ±a Ana phase
based on associated ceramics. A cluster of 63 small fire-cracked rock features in WS2 is dated to the end
of the Late Archaic period by means of two radiocarbon assays and a dart point from shovel tests near
them; the close spacing of features in the cluster suggests a large camp.
Two other clusters of small fire-cracked rock features are composed of lesser amounts of syenite.
Limestone and syenite are equally represented in the cluster of 9 small fire-cracked rock features in
NW2. Two of them date to the Formative period; spaced at a moderate distance, these features appear to
represent a small, diffuse camp. Limestone is the primary rock in the cluster of 11 features in SB5, most
of which are small. Six of them date to the Formative period and three to the DoÃ±a Ana/El Paso phase;
their close spacing appears to represent a small camp.
Moderately large fire-cracked rock features (between 1.5 and 2.9 m in maximum dimension) comprise around 16 percent of the sample; they are limited to six localities, and are most numerous in SB5,
SB6, and WS2. Syenite and limestone dominate relatively equal numbers of features. Features of this size
typically are interpreted as a plant roasting pits. Two moderately large fire-cracked rock features date to
the DoÃ±a Ana and/or El Paso phase, based on associated ceramics.
Large fire-cracked rock features (from 3 to 11 m in maximum dimension) make up 8 percent of
the sample. They were found on four localities, and are most numerous in SB5 and SB6. Made primarily of limestone, they are situated in and near a present-day agave patch. Most of the 12 features in the
SB6 cluster fall in this size range; three date to the DoÃ±a Ana and/or El Paso phase based on associated
artifacts, and a radiocarbon assay places one of them in the early DoÃ±a Ana phase. The largest visible
fire-cracked rock feature at Hueco Tanks is the possible ring midden in SB4 that appears to date to the
Protohistoric and/or early Historic period. The size of these features and their wide spacing at SB6 suggest that they were plant roasting pits.
Midden-Stained Sediments
On archeological sites in the southern Jornada Mogollon area, localized areas of dark sediment containing charcoal, ash, other organic remains, and/or high numbers of artifacts indicate areas of intensive
occupation (Whalen 1981c, 1994a:32). Midden-stained sediments covering 2 square m or more typically
138

Features, Structures, and Distributions

represent prehistoric trash dumps or refuse disposed in abandoned structures, though all structures are
not marked by dark stains and some stains do not indicate structures (Dering et al. 2001:27; Miller
2009:10-30). The findings at Turquoise Ridge exemplify the correlation of midden-staining and intensive occupations; soil auger tests located dark reddish brown (5YR3/2) to black (5YR2.5) sediments that
later were confirmed by excavation to represent pithouses and refuse middens (Whalen 1994a:32-38).
During the current investigations, areas of midden-stained sediment were recorded to delineate
locales of intensive prehistoric occupation at Hueco Tanks. The extent of these sediments along pedestrian transects was plotted on field maps, and Munsell color readings (Munsell Color Company 2000)
were taken of the darkest sediments exposed in shovel tests or on the surface at those localities (see
Methods of Archeological Investigations). Despite some element of subjectivity, the extent and distribution of midden-stained sediments indicate several areas where intensive prehistoric occupation
apparently occurred at the Tanks. In alluvial fan settings like Hueco Tanks, archeological components
evidenced by visible midden staining on the surface are likely to date to the Formative period, while
earlier components may be buried (Miller 2009:10-10 through 10-11; see Environmental Background).
Midden-stained sediments were noted in over half of the 29 archeological localities at Hueco Tanks
(Table 10). The most extensive areas of dark sediment were found in NW1 and NW2, localities that are
separated by 100 to 200 m. NW2 is centered on a drainage and contains a cluster of nine fire-cracked
rock features, while NW1 has only two such features. It seems likely that intensive occupations took
place in these two localities.
Moderately extensive areas of midden-stained sediment were found in CA1, CA5, NE1, and NE2
(see Table 10). NE2 contains Hueco Tanks Village, discovered in 1972 by El Paso Archaeological Society

members who noted an area of dark sediments containing numerous artifacts (Bilbo 1972a:1-3, 1972c:7;
Kegley 1972a:7-8, 1979:19). Excavations at that location in 1972 and 1973 uncovered the remains of
six structures comprising a hamlet dating to the DoÃ±a Ana phase (see Hueco Tanks Village section).
Although visibility of those midden-stained sediments undoubtedly was reduced by excavation, areas
of intensive use are still evident in NE2. Features similar to those found at the Village might be shallowly
buried in other areas of Hueco Tanks where dark sediments have been observed.
The remaining visible midden areas at Hueco Tanks are small, isolated pockets in CA2, CA3, CA4,
NW3, CA7, SB1, SB4, WS1, and WS2. Midden deposits on the north and south edges of the central
basin in CA3 and CA4 adjoin a 300 by 300 m borrow pit where sediment was obtained to build a
large dam in the 1960s (see Environmental Background). A prehistoric village reputedly had been
located in the central basin; artifacts on the surface of the dam suggest that occupation(s) dating to
the Formative period and possibly the DoÃ±a Ana phase were destroyed by its construction (Roberts
2005a:65, 71-72).
In localities at Hueco Tanks that have extensive midden deposits, the colors of those sediments
tend to be dark (see Table 10). Very dark gray (10YR3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2), and dark
brown (10YR3/3) midden staining is almost entirely limited to localities with over 1,100 square m of
dark sediment (see Table 10). These darker color values might represent a higher intensity of occupation in those areas. In two localities with extensive midden staining (NW1 and CA1) the sediments are
somewhat lighter, however, with Munsell readings of 10YR4/2 (dark grayish brown).
It would seem likely that areas in the vicinity of rockshelters, bedrock mortars, and water chutes
would have seen intensive use in prehistoric times. While many such features at Hueco Tanks are adjoined
by dark sediments, a number are not. In fact, patches of midden-stained sediment adjacent to the rock
hills are numerous but small. The largest visible midden deposits extend a considerable distance from
the hills, and include settings like the place where Hueco Tanks Village was found.
Bedrock Grinding Features
Almost 400 bedrock grinding features were found within 20 ft of ground level during the current
investigations, in 16 of the 29 archeological localities. They consist of 313 mortars, 18 metates, and 68+
cupules. Not included in this tally are possible sharpening grooves in a low-elevation rockshelter in NE2
and on the rock hill above CA5 (Bentley 1990:32-37).
The current count of 313 bedrock mortars approximates or exceeds previous estimates ranging
from 250 (Davis and Toness 1974:99) to 334 (Cool-Flowers 2007:79), but does not account for a number of mortars that are located more than 20 ft above ground level. Low-elevation bedrock mortars are
concentrated in three areas: in and near the central basin (CA1, CA2, CA4, CA5, and CA7), and on the
northeast (NE2) and northwest (NW2) sides of the Tanks (Table 11). Midden-stained sediments and
rockshelters also are concentrated on the northeast and northwest sides of the Tanks.
Bedrock mortars generally are thought to have been used to crush and grind wild plant foods like
nuts and seed pods (Church et al. 2009:8-39), but non-food substances also could have been pulverized
in them (Adams 1998:374). The largest of the 170 bedrock mortars at Hueco Tanks that were measured
by John Davis was 27 cm in diameter and 42 cm deep (Davis 1973:11). That mortar would have accommodated the single complete pestle in the park collection from NW1, which measures 11 cm in diameter
by 47 cm long, weighs 15 pounds (6.8 kg), and is made of limestone. Implements of this size would
require considerable strength to use.

Most of the low-elevation bedrock mortars are in groups, and some are closely spaced on rock
outcrops (e.g., Davis 1973:15). Only 12 (4 percent) are single isolated mortars, the remainder occurring
in multiples of two or more. The largest clusters are in localities CA4, CA5, CA7, and NE2, where six
groups contain from 14 to 40 mortars. The close spacing of mortars on some outcrops would make it
difficult for more than a few of them to be used at the same time. The varied depths of multiple adjacent
mortars (Figure 31a) could indicate diverse uses; alternatively, they could represent stages of wear, with
shallow mortars seeing minimal use and the largest ones possibly abandoned after prolonged use caused
them to exceed the depth from which their contents could be retrieved.
The abundance and depth of the bedrock mortars at Hueco Tanks clearly indicate that crushing and
grinding of wild plant foods and other substances was a common prehistoric activity. Which plants were
processed in the mortars is not so evident. One likely plant is mesquite; its pods and beans were crushed
in stone and/or wooden mortars by native groups across the American southwest and northern Mexico
(Adams 1998:377; Bell and Castetter 1937). Mesquite pods mature in the late summer and fall, and are
high in protein, sugar, calcium, and iron (Tull 1987:89). Carmichael (1981:59-64; 1986:218-220) has
proposed that mesquite beans were intensively harvested and processed during the Mesilla phase based
on the distribution of pestles on Tularosa Basin sites, but this theory has not been substantiated as yet
(Church et al. 2009:8-39).
Most of the bedrock mortars at the Tanks are associated with rockshelters; 72 percent of them are
located within 10 m of a shelter (see Table 11). This supports other indications that rockshelters served
as living areas where food preparation and other tasks were conducted (see below). In contrast, the
association of bedrock mortars with midden deposits is fairly low; only 16 percent of them are located

Features, Structures, and Distributions

within 10 m of dark sediments. In conjunction, these data suggest that bedrock mortars are associated
with non-intensive rockshelter occupations, possibly during the Archaic period and/or Mesilla phase
when overall population densities were relatively low (see Prehistoric Background).
The association of bedrock mortars with rock imagery is fairly high; almost two-thirds of the mortars are within 10 m of imagery panels. Cool-Flowers (2007:79) has speculated that Hueco Tanks rock
imagery sites with more elements have greater numbers of mortar holes nearby, but current data on
rock imagery are not sufficiently detailed to test this theory. If mortar use occurred primarily in the
Archaic and early Formative periods as conjectured here, the predominant Jornada Style panels in the
shelters (see Rock Imagery section) postdate them.
Bedrock metates are rare in comparison to bedrock mortars; only 18 were recorded at low elevations
in CA1 (12), CA5 (1), NE2 (3), and NW2 (2). Though few, their distribution supports the intensive use
of the central basin and northeast and northwest parts of the Tanks that also is evidenced by middenstained sediments, bedrock mortars, and rockshelters. Unlike portable metates made on rock slabs, the
fixed positions of bedrock metates represent intensive grinding activities tethered to certain locations.
Many of these metates were made on sloping bedrock outcrops. Lacking basins or troughs, bedrock
metates could have been used to produce flour from soaked kernels and/or seeds (including corn),
which are easily confined on flat, rimless surfaces (Adams 1999:486, 492).
At least 68 bedrock cupules were recorded at low elevations in four localities at Hueco Tanks. Fifty
are atop a boulder at CA4 (Figure 31b), and the remainder are interspersed with mortars on bedrock
outcrops in CA5 (8+), CA7 (2+), and NE2 (8). More may be present in other localities but were not
noted due to their small size. These smooth, shallow depressions range from 4 to 7 cm in diameter and
are up to 2 cm deep. They are on near-horizontal surfaces, in or near rockshelters containing predominantly Jornada Style rock imagery. Cupules are distributed worldwide and generally are considered to be
a form of rock imagery (Bednarik 2008). The Hueco Tanks cupules are atypical in that they were formed
by abrasion, and the interior of some of them is coated with a glossy substance. They could have been
used for preparing pigment, as uric acid has been identified through chemical analysis of similar shiny,
laminated deposits in cupules at the Gila Cliff Dwellings (Kemrer and Corder 2000:40-41).
Rockshelters
The fractured rock hills of Hueco Tanks contain many cracks and overhangs that offer protection
from the harsh desert environment. During the current investigations, 163 sheltered areas encompassing at least 10 square m were mapped within 20 ft of ground level in 21 of the 29 archeological localities. Almost all of them would be defined by the Texas Speleological Survey as rockshelters, because
their entrances have at least one dimension that exceeds the length or width of the shelter. Rockshelters
provide opportunistic housing with a minimal investment of labor, and typically are used by huntergatherer groups that have a high degree of residential mobility (Binford 1990:120-121).
The rockshelters of Hueco Tanks are primarily distributed along the lower elevations of three of the
hills: 52 rockshelters were recorded on East Mountain, 51 on West Mountain, and 46 on North Mountain. East Spur has only 14 low-elevation shelters. On the two large basins between the hills, densities
of rockshelters are roughly equivalent: 48 are arrayed around the central basin and 44 along the south
basin. This distribution of rockshelters is caused by the degree of fracturing of the rock comprising the
hills. Absence of rockshelters in some areas deterred prehistoric use, as reflected by non-intensive occupations in ES1, ES2, and ES3.

143

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

The characteristics and likely functions of low-elevation rockshelters at Hueco Tanks can be surmised
by comparing them to a group of ca. 130 rockshelters and caves on a Hueco Mountain outlier located 3
miles west of the Tanks. These Hueco Mountain rockshelters and caves include Ceremonial and Picture
caves, as well as many smaller shelters; their characteristics are known through survey, testing, and excavation (Almarez and Leach 1997; Cosgrove 1947; OâLaughlin 1977; see Prehistoric Background section).
Information on the Hueco Tanks rockshelters is less comprehensive; none of the shelter deposits
have been excavated, and limited data are available from testing inside two shelters at higher elevations,
conducted by avocational archeologist John Davis (Davis 1972c; see Prehistoric Background section).
During the current investigations, two rockshelters in localities CA1 and SB1 were surveyed intensively
before it became apparent that the abundance of rockshelters at Hueco Tanks would curtail this level
of documentation. Shovel tests were dug outside the drip lines of a few shelters (Figure 32a), to avoid
disturbing the fragile and sensitive items they might contain.
Plan and profile maps of the 2 documented rockshelters and probes of their deposits generally
represent the parameters of the remaining 161 shelters. The two shelters have floor areas of 118 and
98 square m; though not measured, most of the remaining shelters appeared to be similarly small. As
determined by probing, cultural deposit in the CA1 rockshelter reached depths of 7 to 48 cm, while the
SB1 rockshelter had shallower deposits ranging from 4 to 32 cm (Figure 32b). These depths are equivalent to those found in test units in two small Hueco Mountain shelters, which were up to 50 cm deep
(OâLaughlin 1977:170), while excavations in the larger caves reached depths of 30 to 150 cm (Cosgrove
1947:35-39). A small number of low-elevation rockshelters at Hueco Tanks lack deposits entirely.
The dry, stable conditions in rockshelters and caves typically allow for preservation of items that
do not survive in open air sites (Almarez and Leach 1997:11). Hueco Mountain caves have yielded an
abundance of well-preserved organic materials (see Prehistoric Background section). Limited evidence
indicates that Hueco Tanks rockshelters preserve perishable items as well. Cordage, fabric, food remains,
and bone and wooden artifacts were collected by John Davis from shelters at the Tanks in the 1960s and
1970s (Davis 1973:9, 13; 1973b:1). A basket rim fragment from above CA7 and part of a net from WS3
are in the park collection, both coming from rockshelters (see Materials Recovered).
Data collected during the current investigations on the 163 low-elevation rockshelters are limited
to the visible features that are located inside and within 10 m of them, gleaned from archeological
locality maps. Although the shelters were only examined briefly, associated features were found in or
near almost two-thirds of them (Table 12). Over 90 percent of the rockshelters in CA4, NE2, NE3, and
NW2 have associated features, reflecting the concentration of bedrock mortars and midden-stained
sediments in the central, northeast, and northwest areas of Hueco Tanks (see above).
Rock imagery has been recorded in less than half (n = 72) of the low-elevation rockshelters (see
Table 12) but more images may be present, as some are faint or invisible to the naked eye (see Prehistoric Background). The highest percentages of shelters containing images were found in CA6, CA7,
NE1, NE2, and NE4, concentrated along the lower hills on the northeast side of the Tanks and in a canyon adjoining the central basin. Three prehistoric pictograph styles are found at Hueco Tanks but the
Formative-age Jornada Style is predominant, many of its elements apparently representing petitions for
rain (see Rock Imagery section). Pictographs near living areas could have had a secular function, while
isolated imagery in locations difficult to access and higher on the rocks may have had sacred meaning
(Sutherland 1975:66). In the Hueco Mountain shelters, rock imagery was almost entirely limited to Picture Cave, which contained Jornada Style elements similar to those at Hueco Tanks (Cosgrove 1947:155158; Sutherland 1976:2); only 3 of the 72 other shelters recorded as archeological sites contained faint
images (Whalen 1977:133-135; OâLaughlin 1977:170).

Prehistoric occupation of most or all of the low-elevation rockshelters at Hueco Tanks is likely, due
to the density of visible features in proximity to them. Intensive occupation is limited to one-fourth
of the shelters, however, as indicated by midden-stained sediments in or near them (see Table 12).
The Hueco Mountain shelters apparently saw a lower degree of occupation; survey found scant surface

1977:169; Whalen 1977:132).
Bedrock mortars are associated with only 25 percent of the rockshelters, but those 226 features
comprise 72 percent of the low-elevation mortars at Hueco Tanks (see Table 11). Wild plant (possibly
mesquite) processing clearly was conducted in and near rockshelters, particularly in CA1, CA4, CA5,
and CA7 where high numbers of mortars are present. Associated bedrock metates are limited to the
vicinity of four rockshelters in CA1 and two in NE2, and could represent production of flour from
soaked kernels and/or seeds, including corn. Bedrock cupules were found in three rockshelters in CA5
and one in CA4, possibly indicating pigment production (see above). No bedrock grinding features are
reported in or near the Hueco Mountain shelters.
Water was delivered to areas in and near rockshelters at the Tanks by means of natural chutes and
fissures, and captured at some locations by simple rock dams. Twenty-one shelters (13 percent) are
146

Features, Structures, and Distributions

located near natural water chutes (n = 13), or within 10 m of prehistoric dams (n = 8). The low level of
association of rockshelters with these water features could be because the locations of shelters, chutes,
and cracks are dictated by the fracture patterns and topography of the rock, limiting the latitude of
human choice. Rockshelters are near prehistoric dams in CA2, CA5, CA7, NE1, NE2, NW1, and NW2
(see below); the concentration of middens and grinding features in those same areas probably can be
attributed to the availability of housing (the shelters) with impounded water nearby. The water available
from natural chutes near rockshelters in CA1, CA4, NE4, WS1, and WS3 apparently was not a sufficient
incentive for intensive occupation near those shelters, as a low number of them are associated with midden deposits (see Table 12). In the Hueco Mountain outlier, water sources were scarce in the vicinity
of caves and shelters, consisting of rain-filled basins in the cliffs (Cosgrove 1947:33) and intermittent
springs or seeps in canyons (Almarez and Leach 1997:53).
Prehistoric graves have been discovered in 2 of the 163 rockshelters at Hueco Tanks (see below).
Given the complexity of the rock hills and the limited investigation of them, it seems likely that additional humans were laid to rest in rockshelters and crevices at all elevations of the hills. A similarly low
number of human graves was found in the Hueco Mountain rockshelters (see Prehistoric Background
section).
A comparison of data on the 163 Hueco Tanks rockshelters and the ca. 130 Hueco Mountain
rockshelters (see Prehistoric Background) elucidates their respective purposes. The Hueco Mountain
caves and shelters are positioned 200 to 450 ft above the basin floor, while the rockshelters recorded
at the Tanks are within 20 ft of ground level. Water sources are more abundant and available near
the Tanks shelters than the Mountain caves and shelters. Most shelters in both areas encompass 100
square m or less, but a few of the Mountain caves (i.e., Picture and Ceremonial) are five or more
times larger. Thickness of cultural deposits is equivalent in small rockshelters in the two areas. The
vast quantities of utilitarian items in the large Mountain caves have not been found in small shelters at either location. Rock imagery, though stylistically similar, was found in only 5 percent of the
Mountain shelters and is limited almost entirely to one large cave, while 44 percent of the low-level
rockshelters at the Tanks contain imagery. Human graves were found in small numbers in both Tanks
and Mountain shelters. Food remains were recovered in small quantities in the Mountain caves, but
are likely to be more abundant in the shelters at the Tanks, due to the number of bedrock mortars in
and near some of them.
In sum, it appears that the 163 rockshelters near ground level at Hueco Tanks were used primarily
for habitation, and are likely to contain occupational debris rather than the abundant items indicating
ceremonial practices found in Picture and Ceremonial Caves. By extension, the widespread rock imagery in low-elevation shelters at the Tanks seems likely to represent recurring solicitations for rain rather
than sacred pilgrimages.
Dams
The 10 prehistoric dams identified at Hueco Tanks within 20 ft of ground level are simple rock
structures that contain runoff captured by channels, crevices, and natural huecos on the hills. These
dams are difficult to identify because they are modest enhancements of natural features, and many are
hidden beneath rock overhangs or in cracks. Definitive evidence of such features includes verticallypositioned rock slabs, water lines on rocks, present-day water retention, and polish on the surrounding
rocks resulting from intensive use. Association of rock imagery with many prehistoric dams reinforces
other evidence that the images represent petitions for rain (see Rock Imagery section).
147

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Most of the low-elevation prehistoric dams are small and contain pools that measure only a few
square m in surface area. At least one of them is a retention basin (as defined by Crown 1987:212) at the
end point of an extensive water retention system that originates high on the rock hills, however. Most of
this system is sheltered by rocks that minimize evaporative water loss.
The water retention system is known through investigations conducted by John Davis and other
members of the El Paso Archaeological Society (EPAS) in 1972 (Davis 1972b, 1972c; Kegley 1982:39,
77). Their initial intent was to sample the fill in huecos sheltered under rock where imagery sites W36A
and W36B were discovered during an earlier survey (Toness 1972:11, Figure 32; Davis 1972c:2). Davis
found several mounds in a cavern upslope from the huecos and decided to trench them; fill from one of
the huecos also was sampled. On the third day of excavation the crew noticed water lines from 12 to 18
inches (30 to 46 cm) above the floor of the cavern, and discovered a dam consisting of a double row of
vertical rock slabs at the downslope end (Davis 1972b:11-12; 1972c:4-5).
Through reconnaissance up and downslope from these features, EPAS members determined the
extent and components of the water retention system. It begins in a broad open-air pool high on the
rocks that in October 1972 was filled to a depth of 7 inches (18 cm), but drained away and/or evaporated
within two weeks. Two major fissures (Figure 33) direct water from the pool several hundred yards (ca.
60 m) downslope into the cavern, which measures 102 by 10 ft (31 by 3 m) and contains rock imagery
panel W36B. Water runs the length of the cavern and is caught by a series of three dams made of vertical
rock slabs (Figure 34a). They allow a trickle of water to flow 100 ft (30 m) downslope to two huecos

(Figure 34b); each is 15 ft (4.6 m) deep, and one sits 4 ft (1.2 m) below the other. A steep passage of highly
polished rock leads down to the huecos, its entrance marked by rock imagery site W36A. Overflow from
the huecos is transported by the crack 200 ft (61 m) downslope as it drops 100 ft (30 m) to the base of
the hill, where it pools behind a low dam (Figure 34c) inside a rockshelter that contains rock imagery
site W36D, in locality CA2 (Davis 1972b:7, 12, 22-23, 26, 34; 1972c:2-6). Midden-stained sediments are
present within 10 m of the ground-level dam.
EPAS member Kenneth Burlingham collected detailed measurements on the cavern and hueco to
calculate their capacity (Davis 1972b:27-29, 33). The uppermost slab dam was projected to have retained
from 10,000 to 19,000 gallons in the cavern (Davis 1972c:2, 5-6, Figures 5-6; 1974b:5). The two huecos
were estimated to hold 780 gallons (Davis 1972b:4; 1972c:6). All of the components of the water retention system would have been filled during seasonal rains, occasionally to capacity. The open-air pond at
the upper end of the system would have gone dry first; the rate of depletion of water in the other retention basins would depend on their capacity and level of use.
The span of use of this system can be discerned from artifacts in the EPAS collection that was inventoried during the current investigations (see Methods of Archeological Investigations section). Ceramic
sherds comprise the vast majority of hueco and test trench samples (83 and 87 percent, respectively), in
contrast to ca. 50 percent of the collection from Hueco Tanks Village. The primary activity in the cavern
and huecos apparently was water retrieval, which results in high levels of vessel breakage (Kenmotsu et
al. 2008:6-31). Proportions of time-diagnostic ceramics differ between the samples; test trenches yielded
76 percent El Paso Polychrome and 22 percent Chupadero Black-on-white, with 2 El Paso Bichrome
sherds and 1 El Paso Brown rim, while the hueco produced equivalent amounts of El Paso Polychrome
and Chupadero Black-on-white (47 and 41 percent), with 12 percent El Paso Brown. In conjunction,
the ceramics indicate that the water retention system was used throughout the Formative period, but
primarily during the DoÃ±a Ana and possibly El Paso phases. Projectile points are limited to a small,
side-notched dart point that probably dates to the Late Archaic (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:226, 229),
a distal dart point fragment, and an arrow point fragment (Davis 1972c:5-6). The dart points could
indicate use prior to the Formative period, but also may have been scavenged from earlier occupations,
as was evident at Hueco Tanks Village. Visits to the hueco continued into recent times, as it contained a
quantity of modern refuse, including 1960s pennies.
A few artifacts recovered by EPAS from components of the water system might be dedicatory
objects, purposefully placed for spiritual rather than practical reasons. In the cavern, the deepest levels
of two test trenches produced a small piece of fossil coral and a quartz pebble fragment. The hueco fill
(not removed in levels) yielded two thin, highly polished syenite porphyry fragments that refit; while
they could represent a palette, the smoothed surface is slightly convex, and they may be spalls from the
polished rock above the hueco.
In addition to the small dam at the base of the water retention system, nine other prehistoric dams
are known from current and previous investigations; many more may be present, but intensive survey
of the rocks would be needed to identify them. A dam in CA5 is formed by boulders in two low passages
that lead to a tall crevice. The passages and boulders are highly polished, indicating intensive use. Ca. 10
chutes direct water into the crevice, which is marked by water lines and roofed by a large rock. Middenstained sediments are present within 10 m of the passage entrances.
One of the most well-known retention basins at Hueco Tanks is in a fissure at the back of a rockshelter in CA7 that contains the historic inscription WATTER HEAR. The dam consists of boulders, and a
tree trunk in the bottom may block a crack. The sloping rock surface adjoining the basin is highly polished. While the basin probably was reinforced during the historic period (see Historic Dams, below),

150

Features, Structures, and Distributions

it is thought to have existed in prehistoric times because this water source is mentioned in accounts of
some of the first Americans to travel to the Tanks in 1849 (Neighbours 1954:54; see Historical Background section). The basin holds water year-round, going dry only during extreme droughts (Kirkland
and Kirkland 1939:Plate 117; Ormsby 1858). Avocational archeologist William F. Turney approximated
its dimensions to be 40 ft (12.2 m) long, up to 10 ft (3 m) wide, and 10 ft (3 m) deep (Turney 1985:55).
Estimates of its capacity range from 13,000 gallons (Turney 1985:52) to 50,000 gallons (Greenwood
1944:266). Two bedrock mortars are inside the rockshelter, and historic Native rock imagery site E06
and nineteenth-century inscriptions are on its walls.
Three possible dams were recorded in NE1 in a group of large boulders at the base of a rock hill.
One is at the end of a major water chute; the dam is made of cobbles, and sheltered by a large boulder
that has rock imagery. Sediments near the shelter are midden-stained. The second dam consists of
boulders augmented by a cobble wall, and is inside a shelter that contains rock imagery site E17P3.
The third dam is in a hollow on the side of a large boulder that bears rock imagery site E1701 and
02, and appears to have been dug into sand and gravel. Water sources for the latter two dams are not
apparent.
On a gently sloping rock surface on the flank of a rock hill in NE2, two huecos are fortuitously
covered almost entirely by rockshelters. Nearby, a low rock dam encircles a small pond in the back of a
rockshelter that contains rock imagery site N17EFH-M. In a crack above the pond, a large sherd from a
Chupadero Black-on-white narrow-necked jar is cached, dating use of the pond to the DoÃ±a Ana and/or
El Paso phase. The pond and huecos held water in May 1999, following four months of drought.
Inside a large rockshelter that contains rock imagery site N15C in locality NW1, a group of cobbles
is positioned to capture water from the rock slope above. Faint water lines are visible on the rocks within
the dam. The sediments outside the shelter are midden-stained.
A dam in NW2 is made of cobbles and several boulders that may have been positioned manually.
It is inside a rockshelter that contains imagery site N19E2. The dam catches water from the rock slope
above, and faint water lines mark the bedrock inside it. A bedrock mortar is inside the shelter, and sediments in the vicinity are midden-stained.
A prehistoric dam on the rock hill above NW2 was found and photographed in December 1982 by
Texas Parks and Wildlife Department archeologist Ron Ralph and park ranger David Parker. A deep fissure marked by a series of water lines (Figure 35) has remnants of a rock dam at its entrance. The trunk
of a tree rooted in the collapsed dam was ca. 30 cm in diameter in 1982. Fresh water marks indicated that
the dam recently had held water to a height of ca. 25 cm.
As the rock hills of Hueco Tanks have not been intensively surveyed, it is likely that many more prehistoric dams exist in addition to the 10 described here. Additional water retention systems like the one
at rock imagery sites W36A and W36B also could be present at the Tanks; two others were mentioned
but not described by Martin and Sommer (1974:4).
Attributes of the known dams (Table 13) provide some information on their nature and associations. Half of them have water lines and fewer still hold water, indicating that most do not function
currently as they did in prehistoric times. Periodic maintenance probably was required to keep them
at full capacity, including rebuilding of dams and removal of silt caught behind them (Wilshusen et
al. 1997:673). Damage could have been caused by occasional heavy seasonal rains (see Environmental
Background section). As only a small percentage of the low-elevation dams have polished rocks adjacent
to them, most may not have been used intensively; the ground-level pools would have been the earliest
to go dry, due to their accessibility.

151

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Almost all of the dams are inside rockshelters
(see Table 13) and a good part of the water
retention system also is sheltered by rock. Prehistoric
dam-builders clearly had some knowledge of
engineering, probably obtained by observing how
gravity-fed pools sheltered by rock retained water
long after open-air sources dried up or drained
away. Construction of these retention structures
also required familiarity with the natural water
sources of Hueco Tanks and the seasonality of
regional rainfall, likely gained in the course of
meeting basic needs for food and water.
Almost all the dams are in shelters that contain rock imagery (see Table 13), an association
that has long been recognized (Martin and Sommer 1974:5). Jornada Style images comprise all of
these panels except in CA7, where the rockshelter includes historic Apache elements, and NW2,
where some images have not been identified to
style. Masks are included in almost all of the panels.
These associations reinforce other indications that
the bulk of Jornada Style imagery represents water
and petitions for rain (see Rock Imagery section).
The level of activity within 10 m of groundlevel
dams was minimal, as indicated by their low
Figure 35. Retention basin in crack behind prehistoric
dam; note high water mark pointed out by ranger, and degree of association with midden-stained sediments and bedrock grinding features (see Table
recent water line at base of walls.
13). This suggests that water was transported some
distance to living and food preparation areas from
even the most convenient sources. It is possible that midden-stained sediments were washed away by
flow over the dams during high rainfall events, which also would have made areas in their vicinity less
desirable for occupation.
Estimated capacities of the three largest known retention basins at the Tanks indicate that they
could have supported substantial numbers of individuals when full. The huecos in the water retention
system hold ca. 780 gallons, while the cavern in that system is estimated to hold at least 10,000 gallons.
The pool in CA7 is said to hold at least 13,000 gallons. One personâs minimum daily needs for drinking,
sanitation, and food preparation in modern times total ca. 6 gallons (Gleick 1996:87), and in prehistoric
times may have been as low as 1 to 2 gallons (Turney 1985:47). Using the 2 gallon figure, the filled huecos
hold 390 person-days of water, the cavern would have held 5,000 daily water rations, and the CA7 basin
could retain up to 6,500 person-days of water. The capacity of these three sources alone, along with the
purity of the water and its availability during periods when open-air sources had gone dry, surely made
Hueco Tanks highly attractive to prehistoric people, especially during times of drought. The increased
availability of water in retention basins would have allowed more people to gather at the Tanks, and for
longer periods of time, than could have been supported by natural sources alone (Crown 1987:223).
In the southern Jornada Mogollon area, three open-air prehistoric reservoirs have been found; all
date primarily to the El Paso phase, and one is associated with Hot Well pueblo (Leach, Almarez, and

Buck 1996; MacWilliams et al. 2009:155-212; Scarbrough 1988). Their estimated capacities are larger
than the known basins at the Tanks, ranging from 18,500 to 40,000 gallons. Unlike the retention basins
at the Tanks, these open-air impoundments would have been susceptible to considerable evaporative
loss, along with increased concentrations of salts and minerals from the underlying sediments (Kenmotsu et al. 2008:6-7 through 6-9).
Agricultural irrigation features have not been identified confidently in the region (Miller et al.
2009:A-24), and there is no evidence at Hueco Tanks that water was diverted from the hills to the suspected field plot near NE2. Pot irrigation could have been practiced on a small scale, however (Doolittle
2000:309-310; Kenmotsu et al. 2008:6-14; Miller et al. 2009:6-14 through 6-15).
Human Graves
Evidence of at least 13 human graves has been found at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site
to date (see Table 8). Eight graves were documented in previous investigations (Kegley 1980b, 1982;
Martin 1973; Ralph 1991, 1997), and human remains were encountered at one of those places during
the current investigations. Human bones from five other locations were found in the park collection and
during inventory of the Hueco Tanks Village collection (see Methods of Archeological Investigations
section) and are assumed to represent additional graves. Two other human bones from these collections
cannot be identified to location.
To protect the sanctity of these human remains, they are identified to locality in the following discussion but their locations are not further specified. Over half of the burials were encountered in locality
153

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

NE2 during excavations at Hueco Tanks Village, and had been interred in extramural areas (n = 4) or
in fill inside the houses (n = 3). In CA1 and NE3, graves were in overhangs or crevices in the rock hills,
while the human bones from CA3, CA6, CA7, and ES3 were buried in open areas.
The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) is currently pursuing the treatment of these
human remains and associated funerary objects in accord with the Native American Graves Protection
and Repatriation Act of 1990 (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.). Discoveries of human remains on TPWD lands
since 1999 also are governed by the TPWD Policy on the Treatment of Human Remains (LF-99-02),
which specifies that every effort will be made to avoid disturbing graves, and to leave human remains
where they were laid to rest.
Identifications of the age and gender of persons buried in five of the graves have been made by physical anthropologists. In 1973, Al B. Wesolowsky of Cambridge University briefly examined the bones
from three graves in Hueco Tanks Village, and made age assessments based on the degree of dental
wear (Kegley 1982:21). In 1983, Robert G. Franciscus, then a physical anthropology student at Texas
A&M University, analyzed human remains from five graves, including the three burials examined by
Wesolowsky. Franciscus cleaned the bones, removed part of the preservative that had been applied to
some specimens in the field, and reconstructed a number of elements (Franciscus 1983:2). He assessed
age based on the degree of dental wear and epiphyseal fusion, and determined gender primarily through
attributes of the cranium and mandible (Franciscus 1983:3).
Physical anthropologists have not examined the human remains from two of the graves, and the
bones and associated objects from the third grave have not been located. None of the human bones
recently found in the park collection or Hueco Tanks Village collection have been examined by a physical anthropologist. No destructive analyses have been conducted on any of the human remains.
Four graves were found in 1972 in conjunction with TPWD excavations at Hueco Tanks Village
(Kegley 1982:21-22), in locality NE2. Burial 1 lay adjacent to a shallow wash, and had been exposed
by heavy rains in the late summer of 1972. The grave was discovered and partially excavated by a park
ranger in early October. Two weeks later, archeologists opened a 5 ft square excavation unit at that location, and exposed but apparently did not collect a mandible with teeth, foot bone fragments, and a few
ceramic sherds. Kegley (1982:21) later surmised that these bones represented an adult, possibly in the
fourth decade of life based on tooth wear. A large section of an El Paso Polychrome vessel reportedly was
associated with the burial (Kegley 1982:22). The human remains and associated objects from this grave
have not been found in archeological repositories or at the park. The grave was located within 100 m of
Hueco Tanks Village; if associated with that occupation it would date to the DoÃ±a Ana phase.
Burial 2 also was encountered during the 1972 excavations in Hueco Tanks Village, and includes two
persons. The first individual was found in the southwest corner of House 2, in fill within 15 cm above
the floor. That person had been placed on his/her back with head to the west; their arms were folded at
the waist and knees drawn up, and the head was turned to the left. A burned area was noted near the
chest. Wesolowsky surmised that this person had been an adult, probably female, in the third decade of
life (Kegley 1982:22); Franciscus (1983:9) concurred with the age assessment but was not able to determine gender. While Kegley (1982:22) stated that a few bones from Burial 2 had been displaced across
the floor of House 2, osteological analyses and field records indicate that those specimens represent a
second grave. At least one of the bones was recovered near the northwest corner of House 2, in fill 2 cm
above the floor. Franciscus (1983:9) recognized that a second individual was present when he identified
two left humerus bones, one of which was smaller and more well-preserved. Additional smaller, wellpreserved bones were a metacarpal with an unfused epiphysis, a right fibula, and an unidentified long
bone. The individual from the second grave appeared to be less than 15 years old (Franciscus 1983:9).

154

Features, Structures, and Distributions

During the inventory of the Hueco Tanks Village collection, 174 possible human bone fragments were
discovered from units and levels near where these two individuals were buried, that probably can be
attributed to them. Almost all of these specimens are small unidentified fragments, except three teeth
and three phalanges. Due to the association of the Burial 2 graves with House 2 at Hueco Tanks Village,
these two persons probably were interred during the DoÃ±a Ana phase.
On the last day of TPWD excavations in 1972, a visitor discovered a human cranium and a ceramic
vessel section partially exposed on the ground surface within 30 m of House 1 (Kegley 1982:22; Martin
and Sommer 1974:4). Kegley authorized El Paso Archaeological Society members led by Thomas Martin
to excavate the graveâlater designated Burial 3âin December 1972. The person had been placed in a
seated/reclining position, facing north, with arms folded at the waist and knees drawn up but not tightly
flexed. An undecorated section of an El Paso Brownware vessel measuring 27 by 22 cm had been placed
over their head. A burial pit was partially discerned and extended to 27 inches (69 cm) below surface
(Martin 1973:4-8). Most of the bones from the right side of the body were missing, apparently destroyed
by burrowing animals (Kegley 1982:22; Martin 1973:6), and the fragile cranium was consolidated with
sodium silicate (Martin 1973:3). Wesolowsky judged this person to have been an adult in the fourth
decade of life (Kegley 1982:22). Franciscus received the cranium separately from the rest of the remains,
and analyzed them as two burials; he determined that the cranium represented an older adult with
severe cavities and tooth loss, and the remaining bones also were from an adult (Franciscus 1983:6-7,
10). Due to its association with Hueco Tanks Village, this grave dates to the DoÃ±a Ana phase.
While Burial 3 was being removed, Burial 4 was discovered by El Paso Archaeological Society member John Davis. Located around 5 m from Burial 3, the fragmentary cranium had been exposed by wind
erosion (Martin 1973:8, 10). Excavation indicated that the person had been placed on their back and
turned slightly onto their left side, with head oriented to the west; the knees were drawn up and legs
tightly flexed. Although the bones were very fragile, all of them were removed (Martin 1973:9; cf. Kegley
1982:22) except an ilium, which was too fragmentary to recover. Wesolowsky judged the individual to
have been an adult, possibly in the fourth decade of life (Hueco Tanks Village artifact catalog); Franciscus (1983:8) also identified the individual as an adult, and tentatively as male. Due to its association with
Hueco Tanks Village, this grave dates to the DoÃ±a Ana phase.
In August 1979, visitors discovered partially exposed bones in a rockshelter in locality CA1 and
began to dig them up, then alerted park staff. TPWD archeologist George Kegley excavated the burial in
late August of that year. The individual had been buried in a shallow bedrock basin; although most of
the bones were displaced, Kegley noted that the person probably had been laid on their right side with
knees in a flexed position and head to the east. Screening of the sediment around the burial yielded five
El Paso Brownware sherds and a small side-notched (Late Archaic) dart point made of obsidian. Kegley
estimated that the individual had been 25 to 30 years old based on tooth wear, and may have been female
due to attributes of the cranium (Kegley 1980b). During the current investigations, additional human
bone fragments that had been exposed by erosion and/or animal disturbance were noted at this location.
Those bones were protected by covering them with a layer of clean fill, and the area was stabilized to inhibit
further erosion (Howard 1999). The ceramics that Kegley recovered from the sediment around the burial
indicate that this grave dates to the Formative period, even though it includes a Late Archaic dart point.
In May 1982, a park visitor discovered human bones in the wall of a deep arroyo in locality CA3. The
grave was around 90 cm below surface, below a zone of midden-stained sediment. TPWD archeologist
Ron Ralph excavated the human remains and used white glue to consolidate some of them. Franciscus
(1983:5-6) determined that the individual was an adult male between the ages of 25 and 50. The
person had been placed in the grave on their back with head to the east and knees flexed; the knees
and head were turned to the right. A dart or arrow point midsection was found in the rib area and El
155

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Paso Brownware sherds were recovered from sediment above the grave; its depth (see Environmental
Background) suggests that it dates to the Archaic period (Ralph 1997:105, 107).
In July 1982, another grave was discovered eroding out of a trail in locality CA6. Ron Ralph excavated the human remains and consolidated some of them with polyvinyl acetate. The person had been
placed on their right side, with head to the south and limbs loosely flexed; chipped stone debitage and
one El Paso brownware sherd were recovered from the sediment around the burial, and a lead shotgun
pellet was found near the leg bones (Ralph 1997:105). The human remains were few and in very poor
condition, but appeared to represent an adult (Franciscus 1983:10). Artifacts in the sediment around the
burial indicate that this grave dates to the Formative period; the shotgun pellet probably was introduced
into sediments around the burial accidentally in recent times.
In November 1991, two rock climbers discovered a ceramic pot on a narrow ledge and alerted park
staff. TPWD archeologist Ron Ralph and park ranger David Parker found a few human bones and 9
shell beads in the low crevice, near a ceramic pot containing 44 more beads. All of these items were collected, along with a large rim sherd that had broken from the pot (Ralph 1991). The human bones were
two cranial fragments and parts of a rib, femur, and clavicle; they were later treated with polyvinyl acetate. During the current investigations, the ledge where the grave had been found was identified through
photographs and designated as locality NE3; no human remains or associated objects were found in the
crevice below it. The pot measures 27 by 27 cm and is undecorated; the clay is tempered with coarse rock
particles typical of El Paso Brownware. It is elongated horizontally and has an offset, elliptical, slightly
inverted mouth; the exterior has a heavy coating of soot. Vessels of this shape are known as culinary shoe
pots, and generally date between A.D. 1250 and 1700 in the American Southwest; similar cooking pots
are used today by native groups in Central and South America (Dixon 1963:594-596, 606). Due to the
time span of this pottery style, the grave could date to the DoÃ±a Ana phase, El Paso phase, Precontact
period, or Protohistoric period.
The park collection included three human bones found on the surface that are assumed to represent
at least two additional graves. In locality CA7, an ulna (lower arm bone) fragment was picked up by a
visitor. A partial fibula (lower leg bone) was found by park staff in locality ES3. A molar discovered in
the park collection lacks information on the location where it was found.
During the recent inventory of the Hueco Tanks Village collection, 199 possible human bones were
identified tentatively. Eighty-seven percent of them (n = 174) come from units and levels near the two
individuals included in Kegleyâs (1982:22) Burial 2, and probably can be attributed to those persons
(see above). The remaining bones are from House 3, House 4, and Test Pit 1. In House 3, two possible
human phalanges were recovered between 6 and 24 inches (5 and 61 cm) below surface in Intrusive Pit
#2. In House 4, two excavation units located within 1 m of each other yielded 20 human teeth fragments,
recovered between 0 and 15 cm below surface in one unit and from 30 to 70 cm below surface in the
other. Differences in tooth wear and size suggest that multiple individuals are represented. At a distance
of 140 m from the core area of Hueco Tanks Village, Test Pit 1 yielded a medial phalange and a molar
between 12 and 30 inches (30 and 76 cm) below surface. No provenience was recorded for a phalange
found in the Hueco Tanks Village collection. With the possible exception of the specimens from Test Pit
1, these human bones are associated with Hueco Tanks Village and date to the DoÃ±a Ana phase.
In summary, 11 of the 13 known human graves at Hueco Tanks are located in open areas, and 2
are in rockshelters or crevices. Given the complexity of the rock hills and the limited investigation of
them, additional humans may have been laid to rest in rockshelters and crevices. Most of the eight
excavated graves contained adults, although one juvenile is represented. Items purposefully included
in these graves are two large ceramic vessel sections, a dart point, and a pot containing shell beads;

156

Features, Structures, and Distributions

additional sherds and chipped stone artifacts in the sediments around burials apparently were included
accidentally. On the basis of these associated artifacts, six of the eight graves date to the Formative
period, and three of those are associated with the DoÃ±a Ana phase. Another grave could date to the
Archaic period. The eighth grave can only be dated to a broad time span ranging from the DoÃ±a Ana
phase through the Protohistoric period. The age of human bones recovered from seven other locations
in the park is not certain, but at least three of those burials appear to date to the Formative period.
Prehistoric human burials are not common in the southern Jornada Mogollon area; the known
graves tend to postdate A.D. 1000, and almost all of them contain adults (Mauldin 1995:290; Miller 1990;
Whalen 1994a:133). Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site has a relatively high number of prehistoric
graves (13); the eight excavated burials at the Tanks are only equaled in number by those at the Roth Site
(Miller 1990; OâLaughlin 1981:136-137). Most graves in the region lack purposeful inclusions, but a few
individuals were buried with large El Paso Brownware sherds covering their faces (Brook 1971:72, 1976:26;
Miller 1990), like Burials 1 and 3 at Hueco Tanks. Beads are associated with only one reported burial (at
the Roth Site, Miller 1990) other than the grave found at the Tanks in 1991. The culinary shoe pot associated with that Tanks grave is rare in the region, as a grave inclusion or otherwise. Positioning of the
deceased follows no regional pattern; although most persons were laid in flexed positions (Miller 1990),
they ranged from seated to semi-flexed to extended, and faced in all directions (Brook 1971:72). Most of
the prehistoric graves in the region are in isolated locations at some distance from residential areas (Miller
1990); in contrast, human remains were found in or near four of the houses at Hueco Tanks Village.

HISTORIC STRUCTURES AND FEATURES
Historic structures and features in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site are buildings, walls,
dams, and inscriptions. They are concentrated in the central, northeast, and northwest areas of the park,
in localities CA1, CA2, CA7, NE1, NE2, NE4, NW1, NW2, and NW3. The buildings and walls are in NE4
and are associated with the Escontrias ranch, established around the turn of the century. The 15 historic
dams are in six localities; all but one of them were constructed during the ranching era. The historic
inscriptions have a greater time depth, the earliest dating back to 1842; over 400 of them are spread
across seven localities. Although the Butterfield stage station established at the Tanks in 1858-1859 is
now gone, information on it also is reviewed. The locations of these historic features and structures are
specified in this discussion, as most are readily evident to park visitors.
Buildings and Walls
Three historic buildings and three stone walls on the northeast side of North Mountain represent
the Escontrias ranch headquarters (see Historical Background section). The adobe ranch house is intact
though modified, while two other buildings and the walls are in ruins. Descriptions of the buildings
come primarily from Myers (1997). Although the buildings could have been constructed by Juan Armendariz as early as 1895 (see Historical Background section), they probably were built by Silverio Escontrias, who purchased the property in 1898 and filed proof of occupancy in 1904, stating that
I have built one adobe house for my home. consisting of four rooms, and a hall also a
stone house also fencing for corrals etc. all to more than the value of three hundred dollarsâ

157

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

said stone house consisting of three rooms and also a stone stable (Texas General Land Office
School File 54764).
The Escontrias ranch house is a 40 ft square, one-story adobe structure that faces north. The roof
originally was flat; the narrow doorway was framed in wood, with double hung sash windows in slightly
arched wooden frames on both sides of it. A stovepipe projected above the northwest corner of the roof
in a 1939 photograph (Figure 36a). The house was occupied by Silverio Escontrias and his family as
early as 1898 until around 1910. It was then used by other Escontrias family members who ran the ranch
until the property passed to James and Helen Davis in 1956. Between 1956 and 1969, the house may have
been altered when a recreational development was built nearby (see Historical Background section).
The present structure has a side-gabled roof and attached porch (Figure 36b). All four walls have
metal casement windows with concrete sills. The low pitched roof is finished with metal sheeting, and
the porch has a concrete floor and slightly sloped shed roof supported by concrete-filled pipes. The
exterior walls are nearly two feet thick and coated with textured stucco. Inside, a central hall divides the
building in half with two rooms on either side, connected by internal doors. All four rooms open onto
the hallway. The side-gabled roof and porch had been built by 1970, possibly to repair damage from a
fire that reportedly occurred in the late 1950s (Bryan et al. 1999:29). The casement windows probably
were installed in the 1940s or 1950s when that window type was popular. Application of stucco and
installation of windowsills appear to date to the 1980s but may have been earlier. The only significant
alteration to the interior is a small bathroom, partitioned off in the southeast corner.
When the property was transferred to the state of Texas in 1969, the building initially was used for
storage. In 1973 it served as field quarters for Texas Parks and Wildlife Department archeologists during
excavations at Hueco Tanks Village; at that time the northwest room was a kitchen, with a refrigerator
and gas stove. In the fall of 1995, the exterior was sandblasted to remove white paint from the stucco and
brown paint from doors and windows. The walls were patched and then painted coral, and the trim was
painted teal, which a newspaper article stated were its original colors (Aguilar 1995). The building was
designated as the interpretive center for Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site in October 1995, and
was opened to the public in August 1996.
In front of the ranch house are the ruins of two masonry buildings that were built of porphyritic
syenite from the rock hills; their walls were capped and stabilized in the summer of 2009. The walls of
these buildings range from 18 to 20 inches thick, and consist of interior and exterior walls of roughhewn stones tightly laid and mortared with adobe/mud, the space between filled with rubble and dirt.
Silverio Escontrias probably obtained the rock from the ruins of the Butterfield Stage Station, which
apparently was only 250 yards south of his homestead (see below).
The three room building was a residence by 1904 and was still occupied in the 1930s (Escontrias and
Escontrias 1996). A 1939 photograph shows it in ruins, with a small lean-to and brush arbor adjoining
the west wall (see Figure 18b). Measuring 55 by 15 ft, its long axis is aligned to the north. Each room has
a doorway opening to the east; no window openings are evident. The walls of two of the rooms are fairly
intact, while the exterior walls of the northernmost room have collapsed. The ruins currently stand to a
maximum height of 6 to 7 ft, and the west wall has been re-pointed with lime mortar. Although a nearby
granite marker installed in 1936 states that this structure was the 1858-1859 Butterfield Stage station,
artifacts from excavations near it date its first use to the turn of the century (see below).
The two-room building could be the stable that was in use by 1904 (see above). It measures 37.5 by
35 ft, and is oriented parallel to the house and other ruin. The rectangular rooms have doorways opening to the east, and the northern room (32 by 13 ft) is narrower than the southern one (29.5 by 18.5 ft).

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

The walls of the northern room were standing in 1939, and it had a flat roof consisting of what appear
to be wooden planks; the doorway of the south room had a wooden gate (see Figure 18b). At some point,
the stones were re-pointed with concrete mortar; the northeast corner has been rebuilt and includes a
few large rectangular stones. The ruins currently stand to a maximum height of 6 ft. A wooden hitching
post adjacent to the southeast corner of this structure likely dates to the mid-1960s, when a âghost townâ
was established briefly around the ranch house (see Historical Background section).
South of the two-room ruin and west of the ranch house are two free-standing stone walls. A 16
ft long dry-laid wall that is 3.5 ft high originates near the southwest corner of the two-room ruin, and
its south end abuts a large boulder. It appears to have replaced a wooden fence visible at that location
in a 1939 photograph, which constituted part of the fenced corral between the two-room structure
and North Mountain (see Figure 18b). The second wall is a remnant of a low stone retaining wall that
encircled the slightly elevated yard around the house in 1939 (see Figure 18b); it parallels the west side
of the house and is 42 ft long.
The entrance of a nearby rockshelter at the base of North Mountain is partly enclosed by the remnant of a thick, dry laid stone wall that has a maximum height of ca. 3 ft. It apparently enclosed a small
pen in 1939; while recording rock imagery in the shelter, Forrest Kirkland remarked that âpart of the
cave is being used as a cow barnâ (Kirkland and Kirkland 1939:Plate 129). The shelter also contains a
historic dam and inscriptions (see below).
Dams
Fifteen dams were constructed at Hueco Tanks during the historic period. Most are positioned
at the mouths of canyons in the hills, to retain the water that flows down the rocks. The majority
are in open-air settings, but two are inside rockshelters. Seven dams are earthen, seven are made of
porphyritic syenite rocks and concrete, and the material comprising one dam that no longer exists is
unknown.
These dams almost certainly were built by the Escontrias family or their contractors between 1898
and 1950. The age of each dam is estimated on the basis of evidence from aerial photographs, USGS
topographic and military maps, historic photographs, and informants. Seven of these dams are on a
map drawn by Forrest Kirkland when he recorded rock imagery sites at the Tanks in 1939 (Figure 37).
Traditional names for the lakes and dams were recalled by Pablo Silvas, a Tigua Indian familiar with the
park (Binion 1970), and have been confirmed and augmented by Escontrias family descendants (Wanda
Olszewski, personal communication 2006).
Three dams are associated with the Escontrias ranch complex on the east side of North Mountain.
Behind the house is Tanque de la Casa (house tank), an earthen dam that measures 650 ft long, 40 to 70 ft
wide, and 2 to 10 ft tall. The earthen berm that divides the tank into east and west halves is 400 ft long, 20
to 40 ft wide, and 2 to 6 ft tall. The T shape of this dam seems to have been its original configuration, as
two tanks are shown at this location on a 1916 military map. Its pool can be seen in the background of a
photograph of Hansen family members taken around 1911 by El Paso photographer Frank Hecox (Figure 38). Oddly, it is not shown on Kirklandâs 1939 map (see Figure 37). The west tank adjoins a canyon in
North Mountain and holds more water; the shallow east tank could have been used by stock, as it is accessible from an area to the east known as El Pasto (the pasture), according to Escontrias family descendants.
The second dam is located in a canyon on the east side of North Mountain, above the ranch house.
Tanque de las Campanas (tank of the bells) is constructed of stone and concrete mortar and is curved,

measuring 120 ft long, 20 ft wide, and 12 ft tall. It had been built by 1939 (see Figure 37), and still holds
water today.
The third dam is inside a rockshelter west of the ranch house at the base of North Mountain. Las
Tinajas are two huecos separated by a low stone and concrete dam, which still holds water today. This
dam may have been present by 1939, when Forrest Kirkland copied rock imagery âon the ceiling of a
large cave containing one of the natural water tanks. The ranch house is only a few yards away. . . the
water tank furnishes drinking water for the ranchâ (Kirkland and Kirkland 1939:Plate 129).
South of the ranch complex is a little-known dam on the southeast flank of North Mountain, on
a gently sloping rock surface around 30 ft above ground level. Remnants of a mortared stone dam are
on both sides of a broad canyon; the dam continues to the south as a meandering wall that incorporated boulders by sealing the cracks around them with rocks and concrete. The dam is breached in the
canyon and in several other places, but its original length was around 130 ft. Its date of construction is
unknown, and the dam is not evident on aerial photographs or maps. An Escontrias family descendant
recalled that the dam had been breached by 1939 and was only 25 percent intact at that time (Escontrias
and Escontrias 1996; Myers 1997:104).
A small dam at the north end of East Mountain is known only from its plotting on the 1950 and
1955 USGS Hueco Tanks topographic quadrangles. No trace of it was found on the ground during the
current investigations, and it could be a mapping error.
Three dams are in and near the canyon between North and East Mountains. The largest is an earthen
dam that stretches between the two rock hills, measuring 270 ft long, 75 ft wide, and 10 ft tall. This dam
once impounded Tanque de la Virgen (tank of the Blessed Virgin; cf. CaÃ±on de la Virgen, Binion 1970:38,
162

Features, Structures, and Distributions

53), an L-shaped lake that backed
up into the mouth of Mescalero
Canyon. The dam had been built
by the 1920s, when it was photographed by Otis Aultman (Figure
39) during a campaign to preserve
and investigate local archeological
sites including Hueco Tanks (see
Historical Background section).
The water-filled Tanque de la Virgen can be seen on a 1931 aerial
photograph, but the dam was low
enough that a ranch road passed
over it in 1939 (see Figure 37). The
tank and/or dam are evident on
aerial photographs and maps dating as late as 1955, but the dam was
breached in the early 1960s when
developers diverted water through
the canyon (see Environmental
Background section). By 1999, the
arroyo cutting through the north
end of the dam was 13 ft deep.
The second dam is in Mescalero Canyon, on the north side
of East Mountain. Its two tiers are
composed of stone and concrete,
and it is 130 feet long, 20 ft wide, Figure 39. View across Tanque de la Virgen of large dam, in the 1920s.
and 16 ft tall. The lower tier of the Otis Aultman Photograph Collection, Image A1701. Courtesy of the

boulder, and is heavily mortared,
while the curved upper tier is thin and mortared sparingly. During the ranching days, a spigot near
the base of this dam was used to fill a wooden water trough for livestock, according to an Escontrias
descendant (Wanda Olszewski, personal communication 2009). The dam may be visible on a 1931 aerial
photograph, but clearly was present by 1939 (see Figure 37). Although the dam holds water today and is
generally sound, leaking was observed as early as 1972 when it was filled near capacity (Davis 1972a:2),
and continues to the present.
The most well-known water source at Hueco Tanks is inside the rockshelter dubbed Comanche
Cave, in upper Mescalero Canyon. It is called Tanque Calicante or El Lago Culicante (Binion 1970:38,
53), possibly referring to the boulders that impound it. Due to its location in a fissure at the back of the
rockshelter and because the pool is almost always full, it is difficult to observe the rocks that hold back
the water, but a large tree trunk in the bottom of the pool seems to be lodged into them. The pool could
have existed in prehistoric times, as the first Americans to travel through Hueco Tanks reported using
that water source (see Historical Background section and Prehistoric Dams, above). The highly polished
sloping rock that adjoins the tank testifies to its long-term use. The dam may have been reinforced during
the historic era, when the popularity of this water source is affirmed by inscriptions dating as early as

163

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

1849, including WATTER HEAR (undated). It might be the tank noted by New York Herald journalist
Waterman Ormsby on the first run of the Butterfield Overland stage line through Hueco Tanks in
September 1858. Ormsby stated that âthe tanks had been recently enlarged, so as to hold water enough to
last a year when the rain next fell,â but no water was available because of a severe drought (Ormsby 1858).
Before the large dam that stretches between North and West Mountains was built in the early 1960s
(see Environmental Background section), another dam crossed the central basin on a parallel alignment further east. It had been built by 1916, when a military map noted that the tank was dry. It was
approximately 1250 ft long, and a 1931 aerial shows that it had low relief; a ranch road crossed it in 1939
(see Figure 37). In an Escontrias family movie of the late 1930s it appears to be made of rock (Myers
1997:107). Still shown on the 1955 USGS map, it was destroyed in the early 1960s along with a good part
of the central basin, when that area was excavated to build the large dam on the west side of the basin.
Three earthen dams are between East Mountain and East Spur in an area known as East Maze. The
largest is 170 ft long, 30 ft wide, and 7 ft tall; a borrow area behind it measures 150 ft by 30 to 40 ft, and
probably was the source of sediment used to build it. The east end of the dam is breached by an arroyo
that was 11 ft deep in 1999. This dam first appears on a 1942 aerial photograph (Myers 1997:107). Two
nearby dams were in existence by 1939 (see Figure 37). One is 50 ft long, 30 ft wide, and 18 ft tall, enclosing the mouth of a canyon. It held 4 ft of water after heavy rains in September 1972 (Davis 1972a:2), and
is still intact. The third dam adjoins East Mountain and is 60 ft long, 30 ft wide, and 4 ft tall; its south
end is crossed by a ranch road. The lake that it impounds is called Laguna de la Colmena (beehive or
honeybee lake; Binion 1970:38, 40).
Three stone dams are in a canyon on the northwest side of North Mountain. The largest is an
earthen dam measuring 80 ft long, 20 ft wide, and 10 ft tall that was called El Tapo de la Hierbabuena,
referring to the mint that grew there (Binion 1970:53). It creates a lake known as Laguna Prieta (dark
lake) or Tanque de las Piedras (tank of rocks; Binion 1970:38, 53). The dam incorporates several large
boulders. It first appeared on a 1916 map and still holds water today, although some areas are eroded.
Two small dams near the lake are of unknown age. A 10 ft long stone and concrete dam on the north
side of the lake near the dam is dry. In a small canyon at the upper end of the lake, a 20 ft long stone and
concrete dam near a rockshelter is completely filled with sediment.
The order of construction may be surmised for the 12 dams that can be dated through maps and
photographs. The oldest apparently is Tanque de la Casa, evident in a photograph taken around 1911
(see Figure 38). Two more dams had been built by 1916: Tanque de las Piedras/Laguna Prieta, and the
long dam that ran between North and West Mountains. By the 1920s, Tanque de la Virgen had been
constructed. These early dams were made of earth and rock, and include the three longest dams at
Hueco Tanks. The considerable effort required to build structures of this size indicates that impounding
substantial quantities of water for livestock was a priority during the early years of the Escontrias ranch.
Five other dams were built by the 1930s, one being the low stone and concrete dam that impounds Las
Tinajas in a rockshelter near the Escontrias ranch house. The other four dams range from 50 to 130 ft long.
Two are earthen dams in East Maze (Laguna de la Colmena and unnamed). Stone and concrete were first
used during this decade to build unnamed dams in Mescalero Canyon and on North Mountain, south of
the ranch house. The latter structure had been breached by 1939, possibly due to its ad hoc construction.
The 1940s saw the construction of two more dams, one a relatively long (170 ft) earthen structure
in East Maze (unnamed). The other is Tanque de las Campanas, a stone and concrete dam located due
west of the ranch house.
Eight of the 15 historic dams still hold water today, albeit with some leakage. Two are small dams
inside rocksheltersâTanque Calicante and Las Tinajas. Two stone and concrete dams (Tanque de las
164

Features, Structures, and Distributions

Campanas and the unnamed dam in Mescalero Canyon) also hold water; their construction is similar
and it appears that they were built within a 20-year period, possibly by the same stonemason(s). Tanque
de la Casa is earthen, but doubtless was consistently maintained and improved, as any breaches in it
would inundate the ranch house below. The final three earthen dams that still hold waterâTanque de
las Piedras/Laguna Prieta, Laguna de la Colmena, and an unnamed dam in East Mazeâhave small catchments and are less vulnerable to destruction by heavy seasonal rains.
Seven historic dams no longer hold water, five for reasons unrelated to their construction. Two
were breached or destroyed in the 1960s by a drainage diversion project: Tanque de la Virgen and the
long dam that crossed the central basin. Two small unnamed masonry dams near Laguna Prieta were
not maintained, and the existence of a dam depicted on maps for ca. 5 years at the north end of East
Mountain is in some doubt. Only two dams clearly were breached by flooding: a long earthen dam in
East Maze and the meandering masonry wall dam on the southeast side of North Mountain. All in all,
the historic earth and stone dams of Hueco Tanks were sufficiently strong to retain seasonally heavy
rainfall, with few exceptions.
Although the duration of these impoundments has not been measured, the 13 open-air tanks
clearly lose significant water to evaporation. Their considerable size and accessibility were necessitated
by livestock, the primary consumers of those waters. The small, sheltered ponds that prehistoric people
dammed (see above) could not have been used for that purpose, as they did not retain sufficient water
and were more difficult to access.
Inscriptions
At least 441 names and dates have been inscribed on the lower elevations of the rock hills at Hueco Tanks
since 1849. Those that are considered to be historic (1) predate the 1920s, when an increase in recreational
visits to the Tanks resulted in a spike in inscriptions; (2) are names of persons who played a part in the history
of the Tanks, regardless of date (see Historical Background section); and/or (3) are undated inscriptions in
the serif script that was popular in the nineteenth century. Inscriptions postdating 1919 comprise 41 percent
of the database, but are of lesser interest. Not included in the inscription tally are recent names and dates made
with spray paint, markers, and/or lipstick before a public use plan was instituted in 1998 to control access
to remote areas of the park and prevent such unauthorized activities (see Historical Background section).
The texts and dates of most of these inscriptions were gleaned from historical and recent accounts,
photographs, and other sources. Particularly useful was a list of inscriptions that EPAS member Mike
Bilbo compiled while working as a seasonal park ranger in 1983. A newspaper columnist sought information on those names (Turner 1983), eliciting a response from a local historian (Hamilton 1983).
Ninety-three percent of the inscriptions from existing sources were relocated during the current investigations, while 31 have not been found as yet.
The historic inscriptions were made by several methods. Many were scratched or pecked into the
rock, which probably took a good amount of time given the hardness of syenite porphyry. The tools
used to create them cannot be identified, but it seems likely that many a knife was dulled by persons
commemorating their visit to the Tanks. A number of historic inscriptions were painted on the rocks
with a black substance plausibly assumed to be axle grease; when one of these was accidentally brushed
with solvent during rock imagery conservation, the black substance melted, turned glossy, and smelled
like asphalt (Bilbo 1983:8). A few inscriptions were made in red, and rarely, white paint, and one or two
were set down with charcoal or pencil.

165

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

The types of visitors who wrote their names on the rocks at Hueco Tanks can be deduced to some
extent by the dates and locations of inscriptions. For example, in 1851 John Bartlett noted the inscriptions âof late travelers and emigrants; who have taken this means to immortalize their names, and let
posterity know that they were on their way to Californiaâ (Bartlett 1854:172-173). In 1939, the Kirklands
also interpreted the inscriptions based on their context:
Signature of white visitors date back to 1849. Since that time thousands [sic] of names
and dates have been carved, scratched or painted on the rocks about the tanks. The main
water hole is pointed out with a sign reading, âWatter Hear.â The lettering is similar to that
in a name dated 1849 and gives the impression that the sign near the water hole is that old.
The older dates, those before 1920, are found chiefly at the good water holes, or natural
tanks; while many dates since 1920 are found at interesting picnicing grounds far away from
natural water (Kirkland and Kirkland 1939:Plate 115).
The relocated inscriptions that predate 1920 are limited to Mescalero Canyon (CA7), the northeast
side of North Mountain (NE1, NE2, NE4), the north side of North Mountain (NW2, NW3), and higher
elevations of North Mountain (Table 14). Based on the distribution of these 176 inscriptions, historic
activities were concentrated in NE2 (n = 56), NW3 (n = 53), and CA7 (n = 36). When the inscriptions
are considered by decade, areas frequented during those times can be discerned and interpreted within
the context of the historic record of Hueco Tanks (see Historical Background section).
The earliest known inscriptions were made in 1849 (see Table 14); four of them are in Comanche
Cave in Mescalero Canyon (CA7). In that year gold seekers headed west to California in great numbers,
around one-third passing through El Paso (see Historical Background section). Hueco Tanks was a way
point on the upper road to El Paso and points west, as commemorated by W. C. Agurs, who wrote 1849
C.A. after his name (Sutherland 1991:21). After Robert Neighbors and Rip Ford explored and publicized
this route early in May of 1849, W.D. Gibbs reached the Tanks by May 29.

Features, Structures, and Distributions

The 1850s saw a five-fold jump in inscriptions, corresponding to increasing traffic through the
Tanks. Names and dates from this decade are concentrated equally in CA7 and NE2 (see Table 14). One
of the earliest and most well-known visitors during this decade was John Bartlett, who left no inscriptions, though an 1884 inscription by John Barrett was thought to be his (Miles 1984:68). Seventeen
inscriptions date to 1852 or 1853, when many cattle drives and wagon trains took the trail through the
Tanks. In June of 1852, J. W. Rowland set down the only white painted inscription in the park.
A traveling party apparently is represented by three red inscriptions painted on July 7, 1856 in the
rockshelter containing imagery site N17G. The group consisted of W. B. Moody, A. C. Morris, and John
Norboe, who also inscribed his name in Comanche Cave that day. Norboe is listed on the 1850 Dallas County census as a single farmer 28 years of age; he was living with his extended family, who had
immigrated from Norway when he was 10. Norboe reached California late in 1856, where he settled on
a farm in Tulare County and took up surveying, married, and raised a family (Angel 1892:797). It seems
that even after the main gold rush had abated, travelers came through Hueco Tanks on their way west to
improve their prospects in California.
Only three inscriptions date to 1858, the year that the Butterfield Overland Mail stage station was
established at Hueco Tanks. Two are in the rockshelter containing rock imagery site N17G (NE2) and
the third is in Comanche Cave (CA7). One of the NE2 inscriptions was made by J. A. Terry, who was
said to be a Butterfield freighter (Conkling and Conkling 1947:I:409) and was at the Tanks on June 24,
three months before the first stage came through in late September. The other names were C. C. Oattin
(March 30, in Comanche Cave) and J. F. Pinkerton (June 8), who are not included in a list of company
personnel (Conkling and Conkling 1947:I:126-130). In conjunction with other data (see below), the two
1858 inscriptions in the N17G rockshelter suggest that the stage station was located nearby. Stage traffic on the route through Hueco Tanks ended less than a year later (see Historical Background section).
The 1860s and 1870s saw a drop in historic inscriptions, and their primary location shifted from
CA7 to NE2 (see Table 14). Five of the nine relocated inscriptions are in the rockshelter containing
imagery site N17G, possibly due to the proximity of the abandoned stage station, which was used for
camping as late as 1878 (Bowden 1975:35). On June 26 of 1862, a party of four marked their names on
the rocks: W. H. Burrough, M. A. Cornell, Harvy Morgan, and W. F. Thompson.
On September 1, 1869 the nameless inscription 9TH CAV was made in the N17G rockshelter.
Although this Buffalo Soldier regiment was headquartered at Fort Davis during that year, Companies
H and I were stationed at Fort Quitman, ca. 90 miles from Hueco Tanks. Their general duties included
scouting and engaging Indians, and guarding transportation routes (Powell 1910:46).
In the 1880s inscriptions tripled; they were still concentrated in the rockshelter in NE2 that probably was near the abandoned stage station. Travelers passing through the Tanks during that decade
included C. K. Westover of Leadville, Colorado in 1884 and R. E. Baueoh and wife of Tennessee in 1887
(Figure 40a). Groups included John R. Barrett, N. Newell, and B. Mossman on February 27, 1884; Q.W.
Gambrell and Q.C. Campbell on March 11, 1884; and W. H. C. Day, T. F. Davis, and Kate Hopkins on
March 2, 1887. These individuals could have been travelers, sightseers, or ranchers; the latter were characterized by a local newspaper as âa few cheeky persons who take their stock there [Hueco Tanks] several
times a year, and drain the rocks dryâ (El Paso Times, June 28, 1885).
Three individuals from El Paso and vicinity commemorated their visits in the 1880s, suggesting that
that the local populace had begun to view Hueco Tanks as a recreational destination. J. M. [Jose] Garcia
visited in 1882; within a decade he was an Ysleta alderman involved in the struggle for control of city government. In 1887, Mary Phillips and son Austin visited the Tanks; she was the daughter of Benjamin Dowell,
an influential merchant and rancher who had served as El Pasoâs first mayor in 1873 (Hamilton 1976, 1983).

Features, Structures, and Distributions

Inscriptions continued at a high level in the 1890s, but began to shift away from NE2 to boulders at
the foot of East Mountain (NE1). Seven inscriptions near imagery site E17O were made by Tigua Indians who established a camp at the Tanks while hunting deer in the Hueco Mountains (Gerald 1974a:60).
On September 8, 1894 they used a black substance to inscribe their names: Lus Pedrasa, Lus Granio,
Damacio Colmenero, Bibian [Granillo], A. O. [Alfredo Olguin], M. O. [Meleton Olguin], F. O. [Frank
Olguin], and J. P. [unknown]. Other visitors from Ysleta were Carrie Huffman and Hattie Latham, who
painted their names on North Mountain in 1895.
Local political figures who visited Hueco Tanks early in the 1890s included Santiago Cooper and
relative (?) Santos Cooper, who painted their names in the rockshelter containing imagery site N17G on
May 16, 1893 and July 26, 1894 (Figure 40b). Santiago had served Ysleta as constable and town marshal
in 1890 and 1891, during a period of strife. An additional sightseer with political connections was Benjamin Dowellâs youngest son Dick, who visited the Tanks in 1890 (Hamilton 1983).
Juan Armendariz was another prominent El Paso area politician, who established the first ranch at
Hueco Tanks in 1895 (see Historical Background section). His role is documented on two large stone
slabs (not included in the database) found in NE4 that bear the severely eroded inscriptions 1895 [A]
ÃO \ JUAN ARMENDA[RIZ] \ DUE[ÃO] DE ESTE C/ EL SERRO (in 1895 Juan Armendariz was
owner/manager of this hill), and ARME[NDARIZ]\ PROPIE[TARIO] (Armendariz, proprietor).
Inscriptions dropped in the first decade of the twentieth century (see Table 14), probably because
the Escontrias ranch headquarters was built on the northeast side of North Mountain, a short distance
from the area that visitors had frequented. Names dating to the 1900s shift to the north side of North
Mountain, an area that developed into a picnic ground in the 1920s and 1930s.
In the 1910s, use of the picnic ground intensified as inscriptions multiplied. A few names were still
marked in other areas of the Tanks, including those made in 1918 by members of Battery C of the 82nd
Field Artillery. The unit had been ordered to Fort Bliss in December of 1917 due to unrest along the
border during the Mexican Revolution (see Historical Background). Sergeant Emil Roth, Corporal Wilbur Strubler, First Class Privates Camiel Bonne and Harry Pringle, and Private Bartolo Manguno (82nd
U.S. Horse Artillery 1919) visited Hueco Tanks on September 8 of that year, and wrote their names in
Comanche Cave and on the southeast side of North Mountain. Less than a year later, Battery C helped
drive Pancho Villaâs forces out of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez.
During the 1920s and subsequent decades, inscriptions were limited almost entirely to the picnic
ground on the north side of North Mountain (see Table 14). A few were made elsewhere by persons
who had roles in the history of the park. The name JUAN ARMENDARIZ (undated) on the east side
of North Mountain might have been inscribed by the earliest rancher at Hueco Tanks, but also could
be a commemoration by relative (?) S. Armendariz of Aldama, Chihuahua, who marked his own name
nearby in September 1924. Two sons of Silverio Escontrias put their names on the rocks: Santiago (nicknamed Kid) in March 1927 near the rockshelter containing imagery site N17G, and Juan (undated) in
Mescalero Canyon.
While most early inscriptions were placed near but not on top of rock imagery, names and dates
increasingly encroached on prehistoric images in the twentieth century. Examples include two inscriptions marked in charcoal or pencil in May 1941 by Johnny Johnson and Ernest Horvath from South
Bend Indiana, members of the 7th Cavalry Regiment stationed at Fort Bliss. Placed glaring above significant mask pictographs in imagery site N30 (Toness and Hill 1972:4), they were later reintegrated by park
staff and a professional conservator (see Prehistoric Background section).
Overall, these inscriptions reflect the changing history of Hueco Tanks. From 1849 through the
1890s, they represent brief visits of persons traveling the trail through the Tanks, and were concentrated
169

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

around the stage station for several decades after it was abandoned. These names provide more evidence
of that period than the few artifacts that travelers dropped (see below). Recreational visits by citizens of
El Paso and Ysleta become evident in the 1880s. After the Escontrias ranch was established in 1898, visitation shifted from areas near their homestead to a location that developed into a picnic ground during
the early twentieth century. Almost half of the inscriptions in the park are in that area, and illustrate the
negative impact of intensive, unmonitored visitation.
Buildings and Structures No Longer Present
The Butterfield Overland Mail stage station at Hueco Tanks was established in 1858 and abandoned
in 1859 (see Historical Background section). It consisted of a building, corral, and at least one water
tank, which are no longer evident. The few first-person accounts of newspaper correspondents (Lang
1945, Ormsby 1858) do not note the location or materials of these structures. The single oblique reference is by J. M. Farwell; as the stage left the station heading east, he noted that âas we turned the corner
of the station house, could see at a distance the camp fire of the Apachesâ (Lang 1945:I:121). The most
specific information available on this station comes from Roscoe and Margaret Conkling of El Paso,
who conducted archival research on the Butterfield Stage line and surveyed its route in the 1930s.
At Hueco Tanks, the Conklings identified a heap of adobe and gravel as the stage station remains,
and plotted its location on a low-angle aerial photograph (Conkling and Conkling 1947:III:Plate 42; see
Figure 15 of this report). They placed it near the point where two stage roads that descended the Hueco
Mountains on either side of Cerro Alto reached the rock hills of the Tanks, as identified by their presentday traces east of locality NE2. From there, the road is said to have followed a course between North and
East Mountains through the natural amphitheatre, emerging on the open plain at the west (Conkling
and Conkling 1947:I:410).
The Conklings provide the following information on the stage station:
The station, which was a meal and change station, was located on the flat plain on the
north side of the Tanks near the entrance leading into the natural amphitheater through
which the mail road led. The station is described as a house built of rock slabs and adobe
surrounded by a high walled corral built of the same material. Nothing remains [in the
1930s] but a rounded heap of adobe and gravel concealed in desert undergrowth. . . . The
property is now part of the estate of Silverio Escontrias. Descendants of the family have
their home a short distance from the old station site (Conkling and Conkling 1947:I:407408, 410).
The station walls stood as late as December 25, 1878, when a crew surveying railroad tracts took
shelter there after a heavy snow (Bowden 1975:35).
The Conkling description of the Hueco Tanks station ruins in the late 1930s seems to have a stronger basis in fact than other descriptions. A 1937 newspaper account alleged that âpart of the rock walls,
which are built under the cliff and which formed rooms for the guards, are still standingâ (El Paso Post,
December 24, 1937). A WPA recreation guide written a few years later reported that ruins of the Butterfield stage station at the Tanks had disappeared (Writersâ Program of the Work Projects Administration
in the State of Texas 1940:666). In the 1950s, the notion that the stage station and corral had been built
into the ânortheast outcroppingâ of rocks was resurrected (Leach 1958:135). Earlier in that decade, artist
170

Features, Structures, and Distributions

Bob Wygant relied on the 1936 marker identifying the Escontriasâ three-room stone ruin as the station,
and painted an imaginative interpretation of it in use; editors of The Humble Way magazine who published it in 1956 suggested that âwith careful regard for details, Wygant reconstructed the building and
corrals as accurately as he could from the ruins which still stand.â
Water tanks were another component of the Hueco Tanks stage station; they seem to have been
natural features that were enhanced:
The Waco Tanks have been reported to be inexhaustible, but the unusual droughts had
drained them, and the most rigorous search through the mountain did not bring to light
any more. The tanks had been recently enlarged, so as to hold water enough to last a year
when the rain next fell, but until that time the station would have to be abandoned, unless
by chance water could be found in the vicinity (Ormsby 1858).
Conkling and Conkling (1947:I:408) annotated Ormsbyâs account to state that the tanks at the
Hueco station were âon the surfaceâ, and further surmised that âSome of the present masonry dams that
impound water in the surface tanks are built on the foundation of the earth-made embankments dug
out by the Butterfield contractorsâ (Conkling and Conkling 1947:I:410). Of the two masonry dams at
Hueco Tanks (see above), the unnamed dam in Mescalero Canyon fits this description more closely, and
could be the dam identified by the Conklings as one of the stage station tanks. It also is possible that
Tanque Calicante was the water source for the stage station, if the tree trunk in it is part of the enlargement noted by Ormsby.
The Hueco Tanks station might have been laid out in a similar manner to a nearby Butterfield stage
station, the ruins of which still existed in 1939. Around 36 miles and two stops east of Hueco Tanks,
the crumbling walls of the Cornudas del Alamo station were covered with wild grapevines at that time
(Writersâ Program of the Work Projects Administration in the State of Texas 1940:666). WPA photographs show remnants of a stone wall and a pile of rough-hewn rock (Figure 41).
Several aspects of the Cornudas del Alamo and Hueco Tanks stations are similar. They both were
meal and change stations. Both were located near porphyritic syenite hills that contained major water
sources in canyons on their lower elevations, along with rockshelters and pictographs. The stations
probably were built according to similar plans and possibly by the same team, as construction crews
sent out from the east and west ends of the route completed all of the stations and tanks within a year
(Conkling and Conkling 1947:I:124-125). The Conklings mapped the ruins and provided a detailed
description of the Cornudas del Alamo station:
Cornudas del Alamo, the next station, . . . was located about two hundred fifty feet
south from the entrance into the cavern leading to Thorneâs Well in the southern face of
Cornuda mountain. The station, which was a meal and change station, was a large one, and
similar in all respects to the other stone fort stations already described. The high inclosing
walls were built of rock slabs laid up with adobe, and were thirty-two inches thick at the
base. The dimensions of the walled inclosure were seventy-five feet by seventy-five feet
square. There were two rooms, one, twenty-one feet by twenty-one feet built in the northeast corner, and one, twelve feet by twenty feet, in the southeast corner. There was a fireplace
in each room. The single entrance gate was located in the north wall and faced on the road
which ran between the station and the mountain. Nothing remains of the station today

but the foundation stones, partly buried under wind-blown sand and concealed by desert
growth (Conkling and Conkling 1947:I:398-399).
If the Hueco Tanks station had the same setting and orientation as the Cornudas del Alamo station,
it would have been located at some distance from the rock hills. The Hueco compound is likely to have
been smaller than the Cornudas one, as it had one room rather than two. The entrance to the Hueco
Tanks station probably would have faced southeast toward the stage road, which headed toward the pass
between North and East Mountains.
Several lines of evidence support the theory that the stage station was located near but not adjoining
North Mountain, in the vicinity of the rockshelter that contains imagery site 17G. Traces of the two stage
roads approach the southeast side of North Mountain at that point. Two stage travelers recount being
led by the stationmaster after dark to see pictographs that included âwhite men and Indians on horseback, riding against each other with spear and lanceâ (Lang 1945:II:36) and âa rattlesnake, some 30 feet
in length . . . a horse, caparisoned for battle . . . [and] three Comanche warriors, mounted, with lances in
rest, rushing upon their foesâ (Lang 1945:I:120-121). These elements are in rock imagery site 17G (see
Figure 50b) and nearby E01A and E06, but otherwise rare at Hueco Tanks. Inscriptions dating to the
1850s through the 1880s also are concentrated in the 17G rockshelter, set down during construction and
use of the stage station, and by travelers that sheltered inside the station walls in the decades after it was
abandoned. Also, the only known artifacts from Hueco Tanks that date to the mid-nineteenth century
were recovered near the suspected station location at shallow depths in Houses 2 and 5 in Hueco Tanks
Village, and in a test pit at the entrance to the pass between North and East Mountains. These three
small ceramic sherds are blue shell-edged ware (two) and sprig-painted polychrome, which were common from the late 1840s into the 1860s (Earls et al. 1996:176; Miller 1991:6, 8).
The suspected location of the stage station was scrutinized intensively during the current investigations, but no additional artifacts or features were found that could be associated with the stage station.
The area had been extensively modified in the early 1960s, when earthen berms were built for a drainage
diversion project (see Environmental Background section). A mound of earth measuring 250 by 200 ft
and 7 ft tall now covers the suspected location, and is almost large enough to conceal ruins on the scale
of the Cornudas compound.
The rough-hewn rocks that comprised the stage station almost certainly would have caught the
notice of Silverio Escontrias when he established his ranch at the turn of the century; they were located
around 250 yards south of his home, and probably resembled the rock pile at Cornudas (see Figure 41).
He is likely to have used this handy building stone to construct the three-room residence and two-room
stable (see above). Removal of the rocks would explain why the Conklings found only adobe at the station ruins in the 1930s.
The possibility that the stone ruins in the Escontrias ranch complex represent the stage station can
be eliminated; testing near them recovered artifacts that date to the early twentieth century or later (see
below). These buildings probably are made of stones taken from the stage station ruins, however.

ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS
The age, type, density, and distribution of artifacts at Hueco Tanks provide a general indication of
the locations where activities took place during the 10,000-year span of human presence at the Tanks,
and the nature and intensity of those activities. This section focuses primarily on materials recovered

173

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

during the current investigations, consisting of 701 potentially time-diagnostic artifacts collected from
the surface of localities, and 2,638 items recovered from shovel tests. These samples are augmented by
441 time-diagnostic artifacts collected from the surface by visitors or park staff prior to 2001 (see Methods of Archeological Investigations). Artifacts recovered by George Kegley from test units in localities
CA2 and NE4 (see Prehistoric Background) also are considered briefly. The spans of use of these artifacts are substantiated in the Materials Recovered section.
Vertical Distribution of Prehistoric Artifacts
The prehistoric artifacts recovered from 33 shovel tests during the current investigations admittedly
constitute minute samples of the cultural deposits in the 29 archeological localities, even though the
tests were placed in artifact concentrations and/or midden-stained sediments whenever possible. Due
to the small size of the shovel tests (ca. 25 by 45 cm), their considerable depth (70 cm on average), and
the sandy sediments they passed through, a few artifacts from their upper walls may have been dislodged
and included in deeper levels. Notwithstanding these limitations, the shovel test samples are sufficiently
distinctive to consider them provisionally representative of the age, character, and density of the prehistoric cultural deposits in each locality.
The shovel tests produced ca. 2,500 prehistoric artifacts and materials, over three-quarters of which
are debitage. Less than 200 artifacts are diagnostic of particular time periods, consisting of 182 ceramic
sherds and 9 projectile points; 210 fire-cracked rocks are included in the total but were discarded in the
field. The quantity of materials per test varies considerably; their density is classified as low (less than
30), moderately low (40 to 70), moderately high (90 to 170), high (210 to 270), or very high (460+).
Because Hueco Tanks is situated on an aggrading alluvial fan (see Environmental Background section), the buried artifacts probably are older than materials on the surface, and may be preserved in
stratified context. At other sites in the region on alluvial fans, surface artifacts date primarily to the
Formative period while earlier occupations are buried (Miller 2009:10-10 through 10-12). Limited evidence of stratified deposits was found in Hueco Tanks Village, where one of the pit structures dating
to the DoÃ±a Ana phase (A.D. 1000 to 1300) originated from a surface lying 25 cm below the modern
ground level (Kegley 1982:13).
Additional evidence of the presence of buried cultural components at Hueco Tanks comes from the
vertical distribution of prehistoric materials in all of the shovel tests, totaled by level. If these materials
were deposited on a stable surface and worked down into the sandy sediments over time, their distribution would resemble an inverted pyramid, with most of the artifacts concentrated on the surface and in
near-surface levels. The vertical distribution materials in the combined shovel tests is generally pyramidal
(Figure 42), but a bulge in Levels 4 and 5 indicates more artifacts than expected at that depth, likely indicating buried cultural components. Presence of buried components at the Tanks is further supported by
the vertical distribution of prehistoric ceramics in shovel tests, and several radiocarbon dates (see below).
Based on the density of prehistoric materials and distribution of time-diagnostic artifacts, the
shovel tests (abbreviated ST) are divided into four groups (Table 15). The first group consists of 10
shovel tests that yielded no ceramics and apparently encountered Archaic cultural deposits. Additional
data substantiating the Archaic age of subsurface deposits in WS2 comes from radiocarbon assays made
on charcoal found in ST 12 and ST 13 between 20 and 50 cm below surface, in the upper part of a midden deposit. The samples yielded identical 2 sigma ranges of 10 B.C. to A.D. 140, falling near the end of
the Late Archaic period (see Appendix B). ST 13 also produced an unidentifiable dart point fragment in

Figure 42. Vertical distribution of prehistoric materials from shovel tests.

Level 5. Density of materials was low in 8 of these 10 tests, the exceptions being ST 2 in ES2 (moderately
low) and ST 13 in WS2 (moderately high). Archaic components in these two localities may yield interpretable samples, particularly WS2, where occupation was sufficiently intensive to stain the sediments.
The moderately low density of prehistoric ceramics on the surface of WS1, and low densities on the
surface of ES1, ES2, ES3, WS2, and WS4 (see below) also suggest that these localities date primarily to
the Archaic period; the prehistoric component of NE4 also appears to be Archaic.
Shallow cultural deposits dating to the Formative period are represented by three shovel tests where
single ceramic sherds were recovered in the uppermost 10 cm (see Table 15). Two sherds are typed as
El Paso Polychrome and the third is undifferentiated El Paso painted. Other artifacts also were concentrated in the upper levels of these tests, and overall material densities were low, indicating non-intensive
activities. In ST 31 at SB6, charcoal recovered from the base of a rock-lined roasting pit (Feature 10,
see above) at 30 cm below surface was dated by radiocarbon assay to a 2 sigma range of A.D. 980 to
1140 (see Appendix B), falling almost entirely in the early DoÃ±a Ana phase. ST 33 is included in this
group because it is also in SB6, and found a similarly shallow, low density cultural deposit, though it
lacked ceramics. Burned rock features in proximity to ST 10 and ST 31 exemplify the limited activities
that apparently took place in SB5 and SB6. Ceramic densities on the surface of SB6 are moderate and
on SB5 are high (see below), confirming their Formative age. NW4 saw limited activity of a different
type, encompassing the sherds from two pots that were dropped there. The 10 cm thick cultural deposit
sampled by ST 27 also is diffuse, but because all evident sherds from these pots were collected, NW4 has
the highest ceramic density on the surface of any locality (see below).
Ten shovel tests passed through diffuse Formative period cultural deposits that extend to some
depth (see Table 15), based on low numbers of ceramic sherds recovered up to 90 cm below surface

(Table 16). ST 17 is included in this group because it is from the same locality as ST 16, though it lacks
pottery. The 23 ceramics from these tests consist of 13 El Paso Brownware, 2 El Paso Polychrome, 4
undifferentiated El Paso painted, 1 Playas Red, and 3 untyped plain sherds. No other datable artifacts
were recovered from the tests, and most had low to moderately low densities of materials. Although a
few of the sherds could have been knocked down from overlying levels, the majority appear to represent
cultural components found at some depth. Ceramics in ST 28 at NW3 were concentrated between 50
and 70 cm below surface, but a few were found as deep as 90 cm. Non-intensive Formative period use
also is indicated by the moderately low density of ceramics on the surface of CA4, and low densities on
the surface of CA1, CA6, NW1, NW3, SB2, SB3, SB7, and WS3 (see below).

Nine of the 33 shovel tests produced 72 percent of the artifacts and materials from testing (n =
1,762), including relatively high numbers of ceramics representing intensive Formative period occupations. All of these tests were dug into midden-stained sediments, and half were located near rockshelters
(see Table 15). Elevated quantities of debitage, fire-cracked rocks, and faunal remains contribute significantly to their totals, and indicate that these areas saw a variety of activities including tool manufacture
and sharpening, food preparation and discard, and cooking and heating. The highest number of artifacts
was found in ST 22 in NE1 (see Table 15), located 150 m from Hueco Tanks Village. Of the 156 ceramic
sherds from these nine tests, three-fourths are undifferentiated El Paso Brownware (n = 117); the tests
also produced 2 El Paso Brown rims and 14 El Paso Polychrome, 9 undifferentiated El Paso painted, 1
Mimbres Black-on-white Style III, 1 Chupadero Black-on-white, and 12 untyped plain sherds. Ceramics were most abundant in the uppermost 10 cm of these tests, but substantial numbers persisted to a
depth of 50 cm (Table 17), and probably represent in situ cultural deposits, although intensive activities
in those areas could have caused some materials to be worked down into the sandy sediments. The high
densities of artifacts in these shovel tests were not directly correlated with the densities of ceramics on
the surface of the localities where they were dug, which were low on NE2 and NW2, moderately low on
CA7, moderate on CA2, CA3, CA5, and SB4, and moderately high on NE1 and SB1 (see below).

Projectile points from the nine tests with high artifact densities consist of four arrow points and
four unidentified or unidentifiable dart point fragments. Arrow points were found down to 60 cm and
dart points to 70 cm deep. An arrow point was recovered in Level 4 of ST 9 in SB4. Arrow and dart points
were correctly superimposed in Levels 2 and 5 of ST 22 at NE1, and were found together in Level 1 of ST
23 (NE2) and Level 6 of ST 20 (CA7), which could indicate Mesilla phase components when both types
of points were in use, or DoÃ±a Ana/El Paso phase occupations including dart points scavenged from
earlier occupations. The deepest dart point came from Level 7 of ST 8 in CA2.
Some evidence of stratification was found in ST 26 at NW2. An undifferentiated El Paso painted
sherd was recovered in the uppermost 10 cm of the test, and one or more El Paso Brownware sherds
came from every level. A midden stratum extends from the surface to a depth of 45 to 50 cm, and charcoal collected from the base of it yielded a 2 sigma range of A.D. 670 to 1010 (see Appendix B). The
sample dates the onset of intensive occupation at this location to the late Mesilla phase. The age of the
undifferentiated El Paso painted sherd in Level 1 falls at the end of this radiocarbon time span at the
earliest, and could postdate it, suggesting that the cultural deposits are stratified.
One of two radiocarbon assays from ST 9 in SB4 appears to date a possible ring midden (see
above) that is located within 5 m of the test. Charcoal from Level 3 is modern, while charcoal from
Level 9 dates to the late end of the calibration curve, where multiple intercepts are common. Two of its
calibrated 2 sigma ranges span periods of A.D. 1650 to 1700 and 1720 to 1820, overlapping the end of
the Protohistoric period and the early Historic period (see Appendix B). The third time range falls in the
mid-nineteenth century and the fourth dates it to the very recent past. The older time spans fall in the
period when Mescalero Apaches roamed the region and roasted agave in large earth ovens (see Historical
Background section). If the ring midden was used for agave roasting, digging would have taken place in
areas around it to obtain sediment to cover the roasting pit, and could have caused charcoal from the
midden to wind up between 80 and 90 cm below surface. The ceramics and arrow point from this test
represent an earlier Formative period occupation that was disturbed by activities related to the midden.
Additional data on the vertical distribution of prehistoric artifacts at Hueco Tanks comes from
testing in CA2, near the lower end of the water retention system discovered by John Davis (see above).
Kegley placed five test units in that area, which he designated 41EP2B. Three test pits were dug to shallow

178

Features, Structures, and Distributions

depths and/or not screened, but two 5 by 5 ft units were taken to depths of 30 and 36 inches (76 and 91
cm). Ceramic sherds were found in all levels of the two units (Table 18). Located close to the rocks and
imagery site W36D, unit S30 W50 encountered a high density of ceramics with time spans that mostly
overlap around A.D. 1000. The deposits do not appear to be stratified, however, as two ceramics types
found in the same levels have slightly divergent time spans: El Paso Brown (A.D. 200/600 to 1000/1100)
and Playas Red (A.D. 1200 to early 1500s). Dart and arrow points were found as deep as Level 5, and
their vertical distributions differed little. Unit S50 W0 was located at greater distance from the rocks and
encountered a moderately high density of ceramics, resembling the recovery from ST 8, dug in a similar
setting in this locality (see Table 15).

Table 18. Time-Diagnostic Prehistoric Artifacts in 41EP2B Test Units

In sum, the 33 shovel tests dug during the current investigations encountered subsurface cultural
deposits that evidence a range of time periods and artifact densities. The ages of buried cultural deposits
that are inferred on the basis of time-diagnostic artifacts are confirmed in some cases by radiocarbon
dates. Archaic components were found in buried contexts; Formative artifacts also are present at depth
in some areas, and it is not clear whether they represent in situ buried components or materials worked
down into the sandy sediments over time. The latter process would explain the mixed contexts of timediagnostic artifacts in a few of the tests. Limited evidence of stratification was found in a few other
shovel tests, however. Overall, these data indicate that the alluvial fan deposits at Hueco Tanks preserve
a subsurface record of prehistoric occupation that is interpretable, as already evidenced by the intact
buried features found in excavations at Hueco Tanks Village.

179

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Horizontal Distribution of Prehistoric Artifacts
The sample of 1,046 time-diagnostic prehistoric artifacts from the surface of Hueco Tanks State
Park and Historic Site consists of 745 items collected during the current investigations and 301 gleaned
from the park collection. Ceramic sherds (n = 907) make up 87 percent of the sample. Most of them
are rim and body sherds that were collected because they were thought to be identifiable to type, but
405 sherds (45 percent) come from two broken vessel sections in NW4 that were collected in entirety.
Projectile points comprise 13 percent of the time-diagnostic artifacts from the surface, and consist of
121 dart points/fragments and 18 arrow points/fragments.
With the exception of the broken pot sections from NW4, the prehistoric artifacts collected from
the surface during the current investigations were obtained through systematic scrutiny of all of the
level ground in the park (see Methods of Archeological Investigations section), and represent localities
equally. The park collection, on the other hand, over-represents areas that experienced high levels of
pedestrian traffic before the public use plan was instituted in 1998: most of the artifacts come from
CA7, followed by CA5, CA6, NE1, and NW1. These specimens are included in the horizontal distribution analysis because 99 of them are dart points that evidence Archaic occupations. Ten Paleoindian
points collected at Hueco Tanks and reported in other sources also are considered briefly, to shed light
on the earliest occupations. Although the dart points probably come from components that are buried in alluvial fan deposits, they have been exposed in erosional gullies, roads, and other areas where
deeper parts of the sedimentary profile are revealed.
Prehistoric ceramic sherds are the only time-diagnostic artifacts from the surface that are sufficiently abundant to allow for calculation of relative density across the localities. Numerically, the
highest quantities of ceramics (excluding NW4) were collected from the surface of CA5, SB6, SB5,
CA2, and WS1 (Table 19). When acreage is factored in, the density of sherds on localities manifests a
different pattern. The surface of SB5 has the highest density of time-diagnostic ceramics per acre of
any locality at Hueco Tanks (except the anomalous NW4), while shovel testing found a shallow, diffuse cultural deposit there (see above). Severe erosion has caused an inordinate number of ceramics to
be exposed on the surface of this locality. Moderately high densities of time-diagnostic ceramics were
found on the surface of NE1 and SB1, where testing also found cultural deposits with high ceramic and/
or artifact densities. Five localitiesâCA2, CA3, CA5, SB4, and SB6âhad moderate surface densities
of datable ceramics, and all but SB6 had high subsurface artifact densities. Moderately low densities of
time-diagnostic ceramics were found on the surface of localities CA4, CA7, and WS1, where subsurface
artifact densities range from low to high. The remaining localities have low surface densities of timediagnostic ceramics, and most have correspondingly low subsurface artifact densities (see above).
The surface distribution of prehistoric ceramic types also varies considerably among the localities.
Because the time spans of these types do not correspond directly to Formative phase boundaries, temporal differences are elicited more readily by looking at types individually. Excluded from this review are
undifferentiated El Paso Brownware (n = 327), undifferentiated El Paso painted (n = 75), and untyped
ceramics (n = 74), which comprise 52 percent of the surface ceramics but offer little temporal resolution. The sample from NW4 also is excluded, as the quantity of sherds from the El Paso Polychrome pot
broken there dominate the surface ceramics and mask other variation.
Three common types with fairly limited time spans comprise most of the remaining prehistoric
ceramics from the surface (Table 20). El Paso Brown (identified by rim sherds) dates primarily to
the Mesilla phase (see Materials Recovered section for time spans of types). Represented in eight
localities, the greatest abundance of El Paso Brown is in CA2. El Paso Polychrome and Chupadero

180

Features, Structures, and Distributions

Blackâonâwhite appear around
A.D. 1000 and span the DoÃ±a Ana
and El Paso phases; El Paso Polychrome disappears around A.D.
1450 while Chupadero continues
into the 1500s in the region. These
two types were found on the surface of three-fourths of the localities. El Paso Polychrome is most
abundant in SB6, with elevated
quantities in SB5, WS2, NW1, and
WS1. Chupadero Black-on-white
is concentrated in SB5 as well, but
a substantial quantity also was
found in CA6.

widespread El Paso Polychrome and Chupadero Black-on-white ceramics also could represent El Paso
phase occupations.

Projectile points were collected from the surface in substantially lower numbers than ceramics,
but are concentrated in some areas (see Table 19). Relatively high numbers of dart points were found
in CA7, CA5, NW1, and CA1, while arrow points are not abundant in any locality. Stem form (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004: 232-235; Roney 1985b) was used to identify 73 (60 percent) of the dart points

The two Paleoindian pointsâ
one Folsom and one untyped
lanceolateâare from the park
collection and were found in CA7
and NE1 near the pass between
North and East Mountains. Seven
other Folsom points and 1 possible Scottsbluff point reportedly
were found in and near that area
as well, in localities CA6 and NE1
(Davis 1972b:29-32; Martin and
Sommer 1973:5; Davis and Toness 1974:89). Three of those Folsom points were found in a deep
arroyo, and may have eroded from
a buried Paleoindian component.

to particular Archaic time periods (Table 22). The increase in
numbers of dart points over time
at Hueco Tanks corresponds to
postulated increases in regional
population density (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:230-232; Whalen
1994b:625).

The few Early Archaic (contracting and parallel stemmed)
dart points are scattered across the northeast (NE2), central (CA5 and CA7), and southeast (SB3, ES3)
area of the Tanks. Middle Archaic (expanding stem concave base and contracting stem) dart points
are concentrated in the northwest (NW1) and southeast (CA1) areas, and lower quantities are spread
between the mountains in CA2, CA5, CA6, and CA7. The Late Archaic period is represented by expanding stemmed dart points at 15 localities, concentrated in CA1, CA4, CA5, CA7, NW1, and NW2. Interestingly, no dart points were found on the surface or in shovel tests at seven localities: NW3, NW4, SB2,
SB5, SB6, SB7, and WS4.
Distribution of Historic Artifacts
Of the 231 historic artifacts considered in this section, 181 were recovered from seven shovel tests
dug during the current investigations in six of the localities. The remainder are time-diagnostic historic
artifacts collected from the surface, 14 during the current investigations and 36 by visitors or park
staff prior to 2001 (see Methods of Archeological Investigations section). Information supporting the
inferred ages of these items is provided in the Materials Recovered section. Historic artifacts recovered
by Kegley from a test unit in NE4 (see Prehistoric Background section) also are considered briefly.
In the shovel tests, almost all of the historic artifacts were in Levels 1 through 3, while 11 were found
at greater depths, ranging up to 60 cm. Historic artifacts also were concentrated in the uppermost 30
cm of Kegleyâs test unit in NE4, indicating that cultural deposits of historic age are generally shallow.

Two shovel tests dug near the stone ruins in the Escontrias ranch complex (NE4) produced 92 percent of the subsurface historic artifacts. ST 29 was placed near a doorway of the three room structure
identified by a nearby historical marker as the Butterfield stage station, which operated from 1858 to
1859. None of the 114 artifacts from this test predates the turn of the century, however, supporting
other evidence that the structure was built around 1904 by Silverio Escontrias (see above, Historical
Background section). The most precise dates come from two broken clear glass bottles; 65 fragments
184

Features, Structures, and Distributions

are from a whisky bottle made by a firm established in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez in 1909. Six other fragments from
a laxative bottle are embossed CALIFORNIA FIG SYRUP, along with the name of the firm that began
producing it after 1906. Sixteen wire nails probably were made no earlier than the 1890s, and a cartridge
for a 30-06 Springfield rifle postdates 1917. The remaining artifacts are amber and olive glass fragments,
a piece of lead-glazed earthenware, some tacks, a window screen fragment, a wood fragment, a bucket
bail, and other metal fragments.
ST 30 was placed near a doorway of the two room stone structure in NE4 and produced 53 artifacts,
a few of which could be dated. A piece of decal-decorated whiteware has a design that was popular
around the turn of the century, and five wire nails probably postdate 1890. A fragment of machinemade milk glass is no older than 1905. The remaining artifacts are clear, amber, light green, olive, and
aqua glass fragments; undecorated whiteware; metal fragments; and a piece of a horseshoe.
Back in 1972, Kegley placed a test unit near the center doorway of the three-room stone ruin in a
similar effort to determine its age. The 10 by 10 ft unit was dug to a depth of 6 inches (15 cm), and its
northwest quadrant was taken down to 12 inches (30 cm). Over 1700 historic artifacts were recovered,
consisting primarily of shaped glass fragments, building materials, metal artifacts, ceramic sherds, and
ammunition. Although a few of these items could date as early as the 1870s, most were made in the
twentieth century or are not datable. The most time-diagnostic items are 11 pieces of ammunition: a
Union Metallic Cartridge Company .22 long cartridge case (1871-1912), a Smith & Wesson 38 caliber
bullet (1877-1936), a Remington 35 caliber case (1903-1936), a Winchester Nublack 12 gauge shotgun
shell (1905-1938), a Savage 30-30 case (1917-1926), a Remington military 30-06 case head stamped
[19]18, a Winchester Super-X .22 caliber cartridge case (1922-present), three Western Super-X 12 gauge
shotgun shells (1931-1958), and a Winchester Ranger 16 gauge shotgun shell (1938-1972; Barnes 2006;
Steinhauer 2003a). Other datable items are 12 solarized glass fragments made between 1880 and 1915,
148 wire nails that probably date to the 1890s at the earliest, and 22 cut nails that could date to the nineteenth century. In sum, none of the artifacts recovered from three test units near the stone ruins at NE4
can be dated securely to the 1850s or associated with the stage station.
Outside NE4, five shovel tests dug during the current investigations produced a few historic artifacts. The greatest number was found in CA7, where six historic items were recovered between 20 and
60 cm below surface in ST 20. A ceramic poker chip fragment and two rimfire rifle cases were made as
early as the 1880s. Inscriptions in nearby Comanche Cave that date to the 1880s and 1890s (see above)
reinforce the possibility that these items are that old. Three other historic items are more recent; a rimfire cartridge case dates to the 1920s at the earliest, and two glass fragments cannot be dated.
In NW3, the single historic item recovered from ST 28 was a centerfire case from a rifle or revolver
bullet manufactured between 1873 and 1932. Given the intensive use of this area as a picnic ground in
the early twentieth century (see above), the casing is likely to date to that period.
Small quantities of broadly dated historic items were found in shovel tests at three other localities.
In NE1, ST 22 produced three amber glass fragments. ST 23 in NE2 yielded one piece of undecorated
whiteware, and ST 26 in NW2 produced a rivet and two lead casing fragments.
Surface distributions of time-diagnostic historic artifacts across Hueco Tanks indicate the intensity
of use of particular areas over time, paralleling the distribution of dated inscriptions (see above). The
surface sample consists of 50 datable historic artifacts, and the Escontrias ranch complex (NE4) produced over half of them (Table 23).
Armament is the most abundant historic artifact type in this sample, consisting of 28 pieces of
ammunition and 1 ammunition-related item distributed across 10 localities (Table 24). The oldest
ammunition was manufactured as early as the 1860s and was found in SB5 and NE2, the latter including
185

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

the suspected location of
the stage station (see above).
Although the cartridge case
from NE2 postdates the
station by at least a few years,
it could have been dropped
by someone who took shelter
there after it was abandoned.

Over 40 percent of the
ammu-nition comes from the
surface of the Escontrias ranch
complex (NE4). The oldest
cartridge case could date as
early as the 1880s, before the
ranch was established. The
Escontrias occupation from
the 1890s through the 1950s is
documented by ammunition
span-ning almost all of those
decades.

Eleven pieces of armament are of military origin. The oldest dates as early as 1873 and is a rifle
cartridge from CA7, probably indicating use of the well-known water source in Comanche Cave (see
above). Military cartridge casings manufactured in 1918 were found in ES1 and a shovel test in NE4
(see above), and date to the same year that members of the 82nd Field Artillery inscribed their names at
the picnic ground in NW3 (see above). Most of the military armament dates to the 1940s and 1950s,
when antiaircraft and commando training was conducted at Hueco Tanks (see Historical Background
section). Six cartridges were found at CA5 (3), ES3 (1), and NE4 (2). ES3 also produced a machine

gun belt link. While CA5 and ES3 could have been training sites, the items in the Escontrias ranch
complex (NE4) are more likely to have been collected elsewhere by the family or visitors. The latest
piece of military ammunition was manufactured in 1972 and is an unfired M16 rifle cartridge from
NE4, apparently dropped by a soldier soon after the park was established.
Ceramics comprise 22 percent of the time-diagnostic historic artifacts collected from the surface
(see Table 23). The Escontrias ranch complex (NE4) yielded one yellowware sherd that was manufactured no later than 1900, and two sherds of blue transfer printed ware, which reached peak popularity in
the mid-nineteenth century but is still made today. Two sherds have gold banded rims, a decoration that
became common in the late nineteenth century. Two sherds are mold-decorated, a decoration style that
became popular in the 1840s but was made well into the twentieth century. A decal-decorated sherd has
a floral pattern that was popular during the very late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One piece
of porcelain is overglaze painted with a pattern that was popular from the 1930s to the 1950s.
Two other historic ceramics from the surface are datable. A mug fragment from CA 7 bears a vestigial decal of the U.S. Naval Academy seal, and dates to the twentieth century. A blue-banded majolica
sherd from NE2 probably dates to the nineteenth century or later, and was found near the suspected
location of the stage station.
The few time-diagnostic shaped glass fragments are from the surface of NE4. Three sherds of solarized glass were made between 1880 and 1915. Aqua glass comprises the base of an ink bottle made in the
âumbrellaâ style that was popular through the 1890s.
Four buttons collected from the surface were manufactured between the late nineteenth century and
1910: shell buttons from NE4 and CA5, a china button from NE4, and a black glass button from NW2.
Two metal items that date to the late 1930s at the earliest probably were lost by visitors: a toy airplane fuselage from NW1 and a Junior American Citizens lapel pin from the picnic ground in NW3.
In sum, the time-diagnostic historic artifacts collected from the surface during the current investigations and in the park collection date to the late nineteenth century at the earliest. Over half of them are
from NE4, representing the ca. 60 year history of the Escontrias ranch (1898 to 1956). A few artifacts that
date as early as the 1870s were found in CA7. Minor quantities of historic artifacts were found elsewhere,
and none of them date to the brief period when the Butterfield stage station was in operation (1858 to
1859). Military training exercises at Hueco Tanks are evidenced primarily in CA5 and ES3. Manufacturing dates on ammunition indicate that training may have begun in the 1940s, and extended into the 1950s.

ROCK IMAGERY

by Tim Roberts

The abundant pictographs (paintings on rock) and less common petroglyphs (images abraded or
etched into rock) at what is now Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site have been recorded by a
number of individuals, beginning in the mid-nineteenth century (see Prehistoric Background section).
Classification and interpretation of these images was initiated by Forrest Kirkland (1940), followed by
Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967), Davis and Toness (1974), Schaafsma (1975, 1980a, 1999),
Sutherland (1975, 1991, 1995, 1996, 1998), Bilbo et al. (1979), Sutherland and Parker (1991), CoolFlowers (2007), and Thompson (2007). This section presents the most current thinking of the author
and others regarding the styles and associations of the pictographs and petroglyphs at Hueco Tanks,
while incorporating some earlier interpretations.
Because these images represent more than simply an art form and many Native Americans oppose
use of the term rock art, other expressions are used in this section to refer to the rock imagery at Hueco
Tanks. While the pictographs and petroglyphs clearly were placed at Hueco Tanks for more than aesthetic purposes, it is necessary to consider their artistic attributes in order to associate them with particular styles, cultural groups, and/or time periods, and to attempt to understand the possible purposes
for creation of the images. As Mendiola has noted, meaning, art, and style are intertwined; reality and
meaning are transformed through the media, lines, colors, proportions, and symmetry used to render
images of them. The aesthetic transformation of reality is therefore related to distinctive styles and
social conducts (Mendiola 1994:148, 507; 1998:21).
The body of rock imagery recorded at Hueco Tanks to date consists of 275 pictograph/petroglyph
panels, including over 3,000 figures; the total number of images has been reported to be as high as 6,000.
A comprehensive geographic information system database and photographic record compiled in 1999
(Rupestrian CyberServices 2000) facilitates relocation and protection of this imagery. Inventory of the
rock imagery at Hueco Tanks is a long-term endeavor and may never be fully achieved, however, as
many panels are in locations that are difficult to access, and every project has encountered heretofore
unknown images. Also, digital color enhancement has revealed pictographs at the Tanks that are invisible to the naked eye (Mark and Billo 2002; 2006:12-14).
The known images on the rocks at Hueco Tanks are concentrated around the base of the hills, with
a smaller number at higher elevations. Few images have been found on the east side of East Mountain
and East Spur, apparently due to the absence of rockshelters and protected areas. Although the inventory
is not complete, it seems likely that the majority of imagery at the Tanks is known. This assemblage of
pictographs and petroglyphs is considered to be representative of the entire body of rock images, allowing for their styles to be characterized and their distributions to be assessed.
The rock imagery of Hueco Tanks is designated by means of a system initiated by Kirkland (Kirkland and Kirkland 1939) and expanded by Rupestrian Cyberservices (Harry et al. 2001). Panels are
numbered sequentially in the order that they have been documented, prefaced by a letter indicating
189

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

the mountain where they are located; letters designate subdivisions within panels (see Prehistoric
Background).
The photographs of rock imagery in this section were taken by Rupestrian Cyberservices; some are digitally enhanced to increase visibility of the images. Enhanced photographs are indicated as Lab (lightness
and orthogonal channels a or b), CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black), or levels (Mark and Billo 2002).

POLISHED SURFACES
Although this overview focuses on rock imagery left at Hueco Tanks by Native Americans and other
persons, the rocks also have been modified inadvertently by animals, humans, and/or wind. Highly polished areas on vertical and near-vertical rock surfaces occur in a few locations at the Tanks, including
the pass between North and East Mountains (Figure 43), boulders on the west side of East Spur, and
boulders on the west side of North Mountain. These polished areas extend up to 20 ft above the modern ground level in some places, and apparently were caused by something abrading the rocks over an
extended period of time. Lang (1941, 1947) was the first to report polished areas on porphyritic syenite
rocks at Hueco Tanks and in the Cornudas Mountains; he proposed that they were caused by grazing
animals that used the rocks to scratch their hides, and possibly dated to prehistoric times. Similar polished areas have been observed on rock outcrops in Nevada, California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the
Great Plains (Parkman 2007).
The polished areas on vertical rocks at Hueco Tanks have not been investigated, but similar surfaces
on rocks on the coast of northern California have received considerable attention since 2001 (Bettelheim 2006; Parkman 2007). Parkman hoped to recover remains of Ice Age megafauna and Paleoindian
artifacts in proximity to the rocks, but found only indirect evidence of the forces that created the polish.
Wear on the California rocks extends up to 14 ft above the ground and resembles the surfaces of modern
elephant rubbing posts (Bettelheim 2006:14; Parkman 2007:8). Samples of the polished rocks from California were submitted to researchers at Texas A&M University, to determine whether organic material
was present (Bettelheim 2006:14), but the results, if any, are unknown.
Wind abrasion is another common cause of smoothing and polish on rocks (Bourke and Viles
2007:20). Wind polish commonly develops on rocks in areas where sand or other particles are not
anchored by vegetation, such as deserts and beaches (Christiansen 2004:83, 90). Quartzite, basalt, granite,
and other fine-grained crystalline rocks are most likely to preserve wind polish (Christiansen 2004:88).
Domestic cattle, horses, or sheep may have caused a good part of the abrasion on the lower part of
vertical polished rocks at Hueco Tanks; livestock frequented the area during nineteenth-century cattle
drives and over a 50 year period when the area was a ranch (see Historical Background). Erosion has
lowered the surface considerably across the region (Lang 1941:391), which may account for the mid-level
polish on rocks at the Tanks. The highest polished surfaces may have been produced by wind abrasion.
Horizontal and slanting polished rock surfaces also are present at Hueco Tanks, usually near rock
imagery and/or water sources. Although no chemical analyses have been conducted, the polish in these
areas is thought to have been caused by the high volume of human traffic and deposition of body oils.
One of the most extensive areas of slanting body polish is inside a rockshelter, between rock imagery
site E06 and a large water reservoir. Nineteenth-century inscriptions demonstrate that this location has
been visited over a period of at least 160 years, and probably back to prehistoric times (see Features,
Structures, and Distributions section). Polish on the rocks in the shelter containing rock imagery site
N30 (Cave Kiva) clearly date to prehistoric times.

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

CHIHUAHUAN POLYCHROME ABSTRACT STYLE
Although Folsom points made between 9000 and 8200 B.C. have been found at Hueco Tanks (see
Prehistoric Background section), no rock images at the site have been identified confidently to the
Paleoindian period. A few abstract designs on rock surfaces in the Franklin Mountains may be that old,
because they were overpainted by images associated with the Archaic tradition (Sutherland 1995:7).
Elsewhere in the region it has been suggested that extremely weathered or totally repatinated petroglyphs at multicomponent rock imagery sites, where Archaic and Jornada Style petroglyphs occur with
much less patina, may date to the Paleoindian period (Bilbo 1984:295). The oldest images on the rocks
at Hueco Tanks most likely were drawn by Archaic people as early as 6000 B.C. (Sutherland 1995:8),
and are assigned herein to the Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract Style (Schaafsma 1972, 1980a) and
more generally, to the Desert Abstract Petroglyphs conglomeration of rock imagery styles described by
Schaafsma (1992:46-48) for southern New Mexico, west Texas, and Chihuahua, Mexico.
Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract Style pictographs at Hueco Tanks consist primarily of discrete
curvilinear and rectilinear abstract designs like combs or rakes, parallel wavy lines, zigzags, diamonds,
herringbones, circles, dots, and combinations of these images (Figures 44, 45). Elsewhere, stick figure
anthropomorphs (human forms) are associated with this body of otherwise abstract rock imagery. Most
of the figures in this style at Hueco Tanks are red, but at other sites in west Texas, southern New Mexico,
and eastern Utah, Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract figures were painted in a variety of colors including
black, yellow, orange, and white.
This body of imagery originally was characterized by Schaafsma (1972:61-71) as Polychrome
Abstractions, but has since been designated as the Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract Style (Schaafsma
1980a:49) or the Early Archaic Style (Bilbo et al. 1979:234; Sutherland 1995:8). The former designation is prevalent, due to uncertainty about the age of the images. No abstract figures of this rock
imagery style have been directly dated as yet, and assessing the precise age of rock imagery is not a
simple task in general (Russ et al. 1990). The rationale for ascribing Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract
Style images to the Archaic period is based on their similarity to other rock imagery. Elements of this
abstract style also are evident in the Desert Abstract Petroglyph Style imagery of southern New Mexico, for which hunter-gatherer origins have been established (Schaafsma 1992:46). In southeastern
Utah, Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract Style figures were found in a context predating Basketmaker
paintings, which may have begun around A.D. 1 or possibly as late as A.D. 700 (Schaafsma 1980a:54).
In the Lower Pecos region of Texas, similar Bold Line Geometric Style pictographs are thought by
some to have originated during the Middle Archaic period (Davis et al. 2000:395), while others have
suggested that those figures were painted as recently as A.D 200 to 1600 (Turpin 1986a:160; Turpin
and Davis 1993:9).
Elements of the Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract Style are shared with the Desert Abstract Petroglyphs of southern New Mexico, west Texas, and Chihuahua, Mexico; the Great Basin Abstract Style of
Utah; the Bold Line Geometric Style of the Lower Pecos; and other abstract pictographs and petroglyphs
of northern Mexico (Turpin 2001:381-382). San Luis Rey Style pictographs in southern and Baja California include similar elements. Some abstract petroglyphs in the Big Bend region of west Texas are variations of the Diablo Dam Petroglyph Style of west Texas, and Desert Abstract petroglyphs (Schaafsma
1975:62, 91-95; 1980a:35, 55-61; 1992:46-48). The widespread use of abstract elements in rock imagery
across the American Southwest and northern Mexico may represent a broad tradition encompassing all
of these styles. Such a Desert Abstract Tradition would reflect similarity of rock imagery styles as well as
the arid settings where hunter-gatherers produced them, and possibly comparable socio-religious belief
systems. Similarities also could reflect direct or indirect contact among these groups.

Rock Imagery

It is difficult to discern what prompted creation of Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract Style figures
and similar abstract images. On the basis of neurophysiology and neuropsychology, Lewis-Williams
(2001) has proposed that grids, zigzags, dots, and four other basic geometric designs represent entopic
(inside the eye) phenomena observed by shamans (diviners and healers) during altered states of consciousness, and represent an effort to illustrate that experience (Mallouf 2002). These basic images may
have developed into more formalized, complex symbols representing the spirit world and/or transition
to that world. Boyd (2003) suggests that crenelated arches in Lower Pecos River Style pictographs represent the physical barrier between this world and the spirit world that shamans had to pass through
during their ritual death, resurrection, and rebirth in the spiritual realm. Others have suggested that
zigzags or curvilinear lines may represent waterways or snakes that also represent waterways, considered
by many Native American cultures to be portals to the spirit world.
Other researchers question the broad attribution of all Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract Style
figures and other hunter-gatherer imagery to shamans (Kehoe 2001). Certain abstract images have
been termed rain glyphs and could represent magic for petitioning rainfall (Patterson 1992:164; Turpin 2001:388). Some figures may be incantations or supplications, as many panels face toward cardinal
directions, analogous to Pueblo Indian ritual orientations (Layton 2001:322). Abstract images could
document initiation rites, trailblazing, or vision quests, as observed among the hunter-gatherers of
California and the San of South Africa (Layton 2001:320; Whitley 1994:83-84). They could depict
maps to major camps and springs, as suggested by their pre-schematic qualities (Tegarden 2005:78).
Abstract imagery might identify the persons present, their origin, and their individual styles, as in
Pueblo Indian clan symbolism (Layton 2001:322). Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:26) suggests that abstract forms were perhaps used to avoid the negative effects of lifelike representations.
Similarly, Bourke (1892:502-503) reported that a native medicine man objected to a person drawing
his medicine hat, stating that it had taken the life out of his hat. Some nineteenth-century Native
Americans reportedly avoided being photographed because they believed their spirits would be captured by cameras.
Whatever purpose these early abstract images served, they appear to have fallen largely out of use in
west Texas by around A.D. 1000, with the appearance of Jornada Style rock imagery in the region. In the
western Trans-Pecos, abstract petroglyphs and pictographs of the Diablo Dam complex are consistently
superimposed by Jornada Style petroglyphs (Schaafsma 1975:85, 118; 1992:47; Tegarden 2004; Turpin
2001:382).
Rock imagery sites at Hueco Tanks with Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract figures include E03A,
E03B, N16B, N16C, W20M, W20N, W20R, W21A3, E22A, E22B, E25E1, SE26A, SE26B, SE27, W37A,
W39, E40, and E41. They have been found on all of the rock hills at the Tanks, and follow no clear pattern of distribution.

DESERT ABSTRACT PETROGLYPHS
Desert Abstract petroglyphs include a variety of petroglyph complexes in southern New Mexico,
west Texas, and Chihuahua, Mexico that are comprised of abstract elements and have not been otherwise defined (Schaafsma 1992:46-48). The few petroglyphs at Hueco Tanks that fall into this category
are in imagery sites N17C and N17N, and mirror the elements in Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract
pictographs at the Tanks. Due to their similarity, the petroglyphs may have been placed on the rocks by
Archaic inhabitants as early as 6000 B.C. (Sutherland 1995:8), presumably for the same reasons as the
painted imagery.

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

MIDDLE AND LATE ARCHAIC RED MONOCHROME STYLE
A florescence of red-painted representational imagery apparently began in the Late Archaic period
across west Texas and the surrounding region. The reasons for this change in subject matter and the
dominant use of red are unknown. There were new cultural influences in the Lower Pecos and eastern
Trans-Pecos regions, represented by Late Archaic projectile points identified to Central Texas types like
Montell and Marshall. Migratory bison hunters probably brought these points into the Lower Pecos
as grasslands were reestablished (Alexander 1970; Carpenter et al. 1996:89; Dibble and Lorrain 1968;
Hester 1989:59-61; Turpin 1985:9). The arrival of new cultural groups with distinctive socio-political
beliefs could be at least partly responsible for changes in rock imagery and related ritual practices. There
is considerable evidence for ritual obliteration of Middle Archaic Lower Pecos River Style pictographs
(Roberts 2005b), and to a lesser extent, Late Archaic Red Monochrome pictographs (Carolyn Boyd, personal communication 2008), but this practice is not evident in other Lower Pecos rock imagery. Further
west, ritual obliteration of red monochrome pictographs also is evident in the Big Bend region. Obliteration of rock imagery has not been identified at Hueco Tanks or elsewhere in the western Trans-Pecos,
where ideologies apparently differed.
Red monochrome pictograph styles termed Red Linear and Red Monochrome have been defined in
the Lower Pecos region (Turpin 1984, 1986b). Red Linear Style pictographs typically are miniature red
stick figures engaged in animated group activities; images of this style are thought to date from 1000
B.C. to A.D. 1, based on the depiction of bison hunts (Turpin 1984, 1990, 1986a:154). Bison antiquus
went extinct during the Paleoindian period, and the American bison (Bos bison) apparently did not
reappear in the Trans-Pecos region until the Late Archaic period, possibly following reestablished grasslands (Dibble and Lorrain 1968). Two radiocarbon assays on Red Linear Style images center around A.D.
715 (Ilger et al. 1994; Rowe 2003:83-88), however. Red Monochrome pictographs include red, static,
frontally posed human figures that frequently are accompanied by naturalistic animals like deer, dogs,
rabbits, mountain lions, turtles, bison, catfish, and turkeys (Turpin 1986a:154). This style is thought to
postdate A.D. 600, based on one radiocarbon date of A.D. 870 Â± 85 (Ilger et al. 1995).
In the Big Bend region, red painted figures include static, frontally posed anthropomorphs, occasional quadrupeds (probably representing deer), geometrics, and other recognizable forms. At least one
panel in Big Bend Ranch State Park has red paintings of riders on horses; other sites in the area include
Late Archaic Shumla-like dart point images. Based on the apparent age of these images, it is suggested
that at least two stylistically distinct red monochrome pictograph assemblages are present, spanning the
Late Archaic through the Historic period. While Lowrance (1974) reported general similarities between
certain red monochrome images in the Big Bend and Red Monochrome Style figures in the Lower Pecos,
and Turpin (2004:276) mistakenly referred to several rock imagery sites in the Big Bend as Red Monochrome sites, the Big Bend red monochrome imagery is very different from the Red Monochrome Style
of the Lower Pecos. Even less stylistic similarity is evident between Big Bend red monochrome imagery and the red-painted images of the western Trans-Pecos (Lowrance 1974). The hunting scenes and
mountain sheep that frequently are depicted in red monochrome at Hueco Tanks and the surrounding
area are nearly nonexistent in the rock imagery of the Big Bend.
In the western Trans-Pecos and at Hueco Tanks, early representational red monochrome pictographs are attributed by Sutherland (1995:9) and others (Bilbo et al. 1979:234) to the Middle and Late
Archaic Style. Sutherland characterizes the imagery at Hueco Tanks (Figures 46, 47) as âhunting scenes,
with animals such as mountain sheep or deer, and humans with headdresses who have shaman-like
qualitiesâ (Sutherland 1995:9). Late Archaic Shumla-like dart points, some of which have metamorphosed into anthropomorphs, are not uncommon. Although red remains the dominant color of Middle

Rock Imagery

and Late Archaic Style pictographs in the western Trans-Pecos, some black and yellow figures at Hueco
Tanks can be attributed to this style. Petroglyphs of this style are in Alamo Canyon near Fort Hancock,
Texas, and other sites in the region.
The Middle and Late Archaic Style figures of the western Trans-Pecos have not been dated directly,
but include Shumla dart point images that suggest a Late Archaic association for at least some of them.
The reported date range of Shumla points is broad (ca. 2500 B.C. to 800 A.D.; Suhm et al. 1954; Turner
and Hester 1999:186; Turpin 2004:273), but in the Lower Pecos they have been recovered from excavated
contexts dated to the Late Archaic period (Turner and Hester 1999:186; Turpin 2004:273). Sutherland
(1995:9) estimates the date range of this rock imagery style to extend from 3000 B.C. to A.D. 450, and
Bilbo and Bilbo (1991:44-45) suggest that figures depicted in this style were common by about 2500 B.C.
This general date range, if accurate, indicates that the red monochrome images at Hueco Tanks were
painted during the latter part of the period when Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract Style rock imagery
was being created. These Trans-Pecos red monochrome images also would be considerably older than
the red painted figures of the Lower Pecos, and possibly older than most or all of the red monochrome
figures of the Big Bend.
At Hueco Tanks, there are striking differences between the Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract Style
and Sutherlandâs Middle and Late Archaic representational pictographs. The diverse styles may represent two distinct cultural groups, or importation of the latter style from elsewhere. In adjacent regions,
gradual transitions between abstract imagery and representational figures are evident. The Mogollon
Red Style in the Mogollon Mountains of southwestern New Mexico (Schaafsma 1992:48-55) is characterized by zigzags, dots, circles, and rows of short lines that sometimes are used in combination, as in the
Chihuahuan Polychrome Abstract Style. Simple stick figures and vaguely broad-shouldered humans,
bird tracks, and (rarely) fish also are depicted in Mogollon Red Style imagery, however (Schaafsma
1992:54). In the Big Bend, abstract figures occasionally are associated with one or more red monochrome anthropomorph, handprint, or zoomorphic images, but abstract elements remained an important component of Big Bend rock imagery well into the historic period.
The Middle and Late Archaic style imagery at Hueco Tanks may reflect animist beliefs that things
in nature have souls and consciousness. The association of hunters with dart points, including the
apparent transformation of Shumla-like forms into anthropomorphs, suggests a spiritual relationship
between hunter and prey. Sutherland (1995:10) has speculated that the metamorphosis from death to
life, as reflected in killing game for the survival of the group, was a component of Archaic religion in the
region. Metamorphosis could have been reflected spiritually in the ritual death that shamans underwent
while in a trance state, so their visions could benefit the group through healing, successful hunting, good
weather, and other advantages.
Among the rock imagery at Hueco Tanks that includes Middle and Late Archaic red monochrome
style paintings are sites E07B, E08, W14B, W14C, N15A-Set 1, N15B-Set 1, N15E, E17, N19D, N19E1,
and SE23G. These sites generally are clustered on and adjacent to North Mountain. Kirkland (1940:1013) similarly observed that his Type Three pictographsâincluding both red monochrome and abstract
imagesâwere concentrated in the north part of Hueco Tanks.

JORNADA STYLE
Following the Late Archaic period, the nature and quantity of rock imagery at Hueco Tanks and in
the surrounding region changed considerably, coinciding with the adoption and growing dependence

199

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

on agriculture, changing ideologies, and increased sedentism. The term Jornada Style is used to
designate this body of imagery. It is associated with a cultural area designated as the Jornada Branch of
the Mogollon, which extends from Carrizozo, New Mexico to Villa Ahumada in the state of Chihuahua,
Mexico, and stretches from ca. 150 miles east to 75 miles west of El Paso (Lehmer 1948:9-11, 71). Jornada
Mogollon people created more rock imagery than their predecessors, apparently for ideological reasons
(Schaafsma 1999:188); Jornada Style images account for the majority of the figures at Hueco Tanks, and
were designated as Type Two pictographs by Kirkland (1940:10).
After El Paso brownware ceramics appeared in the southern Jornada Mogollon area around A.D. 200
(Miller 2005b:68), a rapid succession of changes in settlement, subsistence, and architecture occurred
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:236). Subsistence initially focused on hunting and gathering but gradually
shifted to increased use of corn and finally, a specialized agricultural adaptation (Hard, Mauldin, and
Raymond 1996:297-298; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:244; Whalen 1994:142). Transition to an economy
in which corn was a staple element did not occur until ca. A.D. 1100, however (Hard, Mauldin, and Raymond 1996:298). At Hueco Tanks, a small settlement that was partly reliant on agriculture was occupied
between A.D. 1000 and 1300 (Kegley 1980a, 1982; see Hueco Tanks Village section).
Although some researchers have suggested that elements similar to those of Jornada Style rock
imagery occur as far away as the Big Bend region of Texas, true Jornada Style rock imagery appears to
be limited to the Jornada Mogollon cultural area. One of the foremost Jornada Style images is a goggleeyed figure with a rectangular or trapezoidal body resembling the Mesoamerican rain deity Tlaloc, who
is associated with caves, springs, and sources of water (Schaafsma 1999:167). The Mesoamerican deity
Quetzalcoatl, represented by feathered and sometimes horned serpents (Schaafsma 1992:64; Sutherland
1995:12-13), also is depicted in Jornada Style imagery, though less frequently than Tlaloc-like figures.
Other common Jornada Style figures are masks/faces with almond eyes and abstract decorations, horns,
feathers, and pointed caps. Additional figures in this style are large blanket designs; animals with bent
legs and formal decorative patterns on their bodies; flying birds and spread-winged eagles; turtles, tadpoles, fish, and insects; and corn, cloud terraces, and rainbows (Schaafsma 1980a:199). Continuous
unbroken lines form many of the complicated line patterns that fill the bodies of Tlaloc-like figures, and
comprise blanket designs (Stewart et al. 1990:309).
Originally, this style was divided into eastern and western phases based on perceived stylistic differences, the eastern phase containing more elaborate decorative aspects and a richer element inventory
than the western phase (Schaafsma 1980a:199-201). The western expression was concentrated in the
Mimbres Valley, while the eastern was found along the Rio Grande and in the Tularosa Basin (Schaafsma
1972, 1980a:199-201, 1992:62). Additional data have since shown that, except for a greater number of
mask images in eastern sites, there are insufficient differences between eastern and western Jornada Style
rock images to warrant their distinction (Schaafsma 1992:62).
The Jornada Style apparently represents the blending of representational Archaic figures and Mesoamerican imagery (Sutherland 1998:64-66), suggesting that aspects of Mesoamerican ideology influenced the Jornada Mogollon area, possibly by way of Casas Grandes in northern Chihuahua, Mexico
(Di Peso 1968). Brody (1991:76) and others have noted similarities between Jornada Style, Mimbres,
and Pueblo iconography. Mexican-Mogollon-Pueblo religious continuity was proposed by Ellis and
Hammack (1968:39). Thompson (2007) has suggested that Jornada, Mesoamerican, Mimbres, Casas
Grandes, and Pueblo IV cultures shared a widespread ideology, manifested through common elements,
icons, and motifs in rock and ceramic imagery.
The combination of Archaic hunter-gatherer ideology with ideas from Mesoamerica that is represented by Jornada Style mask images is considered by some to evidence the beginning of the katsina

200

Rock Imagery

cult that is still practiced in Pueblo communities today (Schaafsma 1980b, 1999:184; Schaafsma and
Schaafsma 1974; Sutherland 1996:16-17, 68-76). Based on the abundance and possible early age of the
mask images, it has been suggested that Hueco Tanks is one of the first places where those influences
came together (Sutherland 1996:70-71; Sutherland and Parker 1991:1). Others have proposed that the
katsina cult originated in east-central Arizona, based on the convergence of multiple architectural and
iconographic attributes (Adams 1991:118-123). If mask images are not related to katsinas, they could be
highly abstracted faces of humans, ancestors, or spirits (Thompson 2007:89). Although the term mask
is used here to refer to these images, their connection to the katsina cult is not necessarily implied.
Some researchers believe that the roots of the Jornada Style extend beyond adjacent regions. Crotty
(Duran and Crotty 1999:50) notes that âthe outsized eyes and the limbless trapezoidal figure [Tlaloc]
are reminiscent of the Archaic Barrier Canyon Style figures from Utah.â Phillips et al. (2006:22) suggest
that the Jornada Style horned serpent originated in the Caddo region to the east, and was transmitted
to the Jornada Mogollon area via the south Plains and the Mimbres Valley. Others believe that Jornada
Mogollon rock imagery and religion developed independently of other regions.
Jornada Style imagery is generally believed to date between A.D. 1000 and 1450 (Schaafsma 1992:60).
At Hueco Tanks, an attempt was made to refine the date range for Jornada Style pictographs through
radiocarbon assay of black organic pigment (charcoal?) from rock imagery sites E12, W20, SE23, SE24,
and SE28. The two-sigma calibrated age spans of nine radiocarbon dates suggest that Jornada Mogollon
people at Hueco Tanks may have actually begun their gallery of images as early as A.D. 400, and continued through at least A.D. 1400 (Hyman et al. 1999:76; Rowe 2005:91), spanning most of the Mesilla,
DoÃ±a Ana, and El Paso phases. These radiocarbon dates are provisional, however, due to inconsistencies
in split samples, lack of correction factors, and the possibility of contamination (see Prehistoric Background section). Despite uncertainty about the precise time span of the Jornada Style figures at Hueco
Tanks, it is reasonable to surmise that the thousands of images in this style were painted over several
hundred years at a minimum.
The assemblage of Jornada Style images at Hueco Tanks consists almost entirely of pictographs,
in contrast to some other Jornada Style sites where petroglyphs predominate. The Tanks contain the
largest known concentration of Jornada Style mask pictographs (Figure 48), consisting of more than
200 images (Davis and Toness 1974; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:173-198; Schaafsma 1980a:211-217;
Sutherland 1995:15). Some masks are rendered carefully in solid masses of color and are highly symbolic;
others are executed less precisely in outline, but show realistic facial features (Kirkland 1940:14-19).
Kirkland (1940:23) noted the resemblance of these images to katsina masks, which also are symbolic or
realistic. Inuit people of Alaska drew similar distinctions between mask types; sacred masks were made
by shamans or at their direction and represented spirits, while secular animal- and human-face masks
could be carved and worn by anyone (Himmelheber 1953:56-57; Lantis 1966:90). The mask pictographs
vary considerably in size, and were painted in red, black, yellow, white, and rarely, blue-green pigment.
Other Jornada Style imagery at Hueco Tanks includes 17 Tlaloc-like paintings, at least 10 cloud terrace
(Figure 49a), bowl-type designs (Figure 49b), and 7 or more katsina-like human figures wearing masks
(Figure 49c; Kirkland 1940:19, Plate 6; Schaafsma 1999:179, 183).
The purposes behind the creation of Jornada Style figures are not readily apparent, but can be
surmised. Tlaloc-like figures and cloud terrace images (also known as step-fret or step-wedge designs)
appear to represent efforts by the Jornada people to obtain rain for successful crops (Creel 1989:83-84;
Schaafsma 1980a, 1999:178-183; Stewart et al. 1990:313). Similarly, the plumed serpent Quetzalcoatl
is often compared to the Pueblo horned or plumed water serpent (Ellis and Hammack 1968; Kelley
1966:109; Parsons 1939), which is considered to be the patron deity of rivers and underground water,
and also is associated with fertility and rain (Williamson 1987:96-97). Water symbolism among Jornada

Style imagery is not limited to these figures, however. In Pueblo ideology and by extension the antecedent Jornada Mogollon ideology, pottery symbols and katsina-like mask images are/were important
figures in petitions for rain (Schaafsma 2002:51-66). Pots are sources of clouds or rain, and symbols of
springs and sipapus (both points of access to the underworld), while katsinas are rain-bringing ancestors from the underworld (Schaafsma 2002:62). Dragonfly-like entitiesâincluding several illustrated at
Hueco Tanksâalso could symbolize providers of rain or other water sources. Other images at Hueco
Tanks seem unlikely to represent water, including complex geometric designs, the meaning of which is
not readily apparent. Animal forms including quadrupeds (Figure 49d), birds, amphibians, and other
insects might have embodied symbolic meanings and provided specific powers to their creators or the
group.

The location of Jornada Style figures at Hueco Tanks appears to further emphasize the importance
of water to the creators of these images. While the other styles of rock imagery at Hueco Tanks are limited primarily to lower rock outcrops, Jornada Style figures also are found on the upper levels of the rock
hills. The highest images are in site W55, located near the peak of West Mountain. These elevated pictographs could relate to the role of mountains in rainfall production. In the Pueblo hydrologic cycle (Phillips et al. 2006:18), waters move up from the underworld, through the mountains, and into the upper
world to be released as rain. The water in caves, crevices, and hollows at Hueco Tanks undoubtedly led
early agriculturalists in this otherwise arid environment to view the locale as sacred (Eliade 1959:11,
14, 1963:2-4; Mallam 1984:66-71; Schaafsma 1999:179). Many Native American groups consider water
to have beneficent and protective powers (Marriott and Rachlin 1968), and caves and crevices are considered to be avenues to the underworld (Heyden 1975:134; Vogt 1976:16-17, 25). Placement of water
symbols in the caves and crevices of the Tanks may have been an appeal to the deities of the underworld
(Schaafsma 1992:77), analogous to modern Pueblo shrines in small caves and shallow depressions near
villages or houses (Fewkes 1924; Kirkland 1940:24). The sheer number of images in particular locations
may have been intended to strengthen petitions for rain (Young 1982:184).
The location of many Jornada Style images in areas of Hueco Tanks that are hidden and difficult to
access may further indicate that not all imagery was intended to be viewed by the entire community or

203

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

those outside the community. Images that were placed in relatively inaccessible areas like small circular
niches and weathered indentations in rock faces, under boulders, in deep shelters, in narrow crevices,
or on ceilings or high walls of rockshelters may have served a sacred purpose. In contrast, accessible
images located near living areas may have served a secular function (Kirkland 1940:19; Sutherland
1975:66). Shamans or their designates could have directed the design and placement of rock imagery
at Hueco Tanks to successfully petition the deities, while improper treatment of such powerful symbols
would have been considered dangerous. For example, Australian Aborigines believe that sacrilegious
behavior or casual regard for ceremonial imagery may anger the spirits that live in caves, clay-pans, and
other natural features, causing death and destruction (Aboriginal Australia Art & Culture Centre, Alice
Springs n.d.).
The designation of a particular individual to create some of the imagery at Hueco Tanks may be
indicated by recent research by Cool-Flowers (2007:84-86). She has suggested that one individual or
Master Painter created some of the distinctive Jornada Style images at the Tanks, based on the content,
style, and application of pigment in certain masks, felines, and birds. Although this concept views rock
imagery as art rather than a spiritual medium, the notion of particular individuals creating multiple
pictographs is intriguing.
As noted, Jornada Style pictographs comprise the majority of rock imagery at Hueco Tanks, and are
scattered across all levels of the hills. Two panels containing Jornada Style petroglyphs are at the base of hills.
Site E28 includes a mask created by pecking an image into the rock, then applying pigment on the pecked
area. Site N15C includes Jornada Style petroglyphs that appear to be mountain lion tracks and roadrunner
tracks. Schaafsma (1980a:232-233) suggests that animal tracks were depicted by the Jornada Mogollon
not only to identify particular species, but to represent traits embodied in those species. Puebloan people
admired roadrunners for their strength, courage, knowledge, speed, and power to confuse, and connected
them with war, funerals, protection against witchcraft, and curing. In Pueblo myth and ritual, the mountain lion is the patron of hunters and warriors, and is represented in ceremonies (Smith 1952:202). The
roadrunner and mountain lion tracks at Hueco Tanks could have had guardian and protective functions.

HISTORIC ROCK IMAGERY
The Jornada Style initiated a 1,000 year tradition of style and symbolism that is expressed in modern Pueblo dance costumes, katsina forms, altar painting, and to a lesser degree, Navajo sand painting
(Schaafsma 1992:60). The historic rock imagery of Hueco Tanks (Kirklandâs [1940:10] Type One pictographs) shows little influence from the Jornada Style, however. These images appear to have been left
by nomadic bands that moved through the area after A.D. 1450, including members of the Mescalero
Apache, Kiowa, and Comanche tribes. Names, dates, and possibly imagery also were painted by the
Tigua Indians of Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, who settled in the El Paso area in 1680 after being displaced from
central New Mexico during the Pueblo Revolt (see Historical Background section).
Mescalero Apache
The Apache Indians are descendants of Athapascan groups that may have entered central New
Mexico as early as the 1200s or 1300s (Forbes 1994:xviii) but certainly by the 1500s (Gunnerson 1956).
They were nomadic bison hunters by the early 1600s (Schaafsma 1992:78) and possibly earlier (Winship 1904:111; Hammond and Rey 1940:261). The term Mescalero was first applied in the mid-1600s to
204

Rock Imagery

Apaches occupying a territory extending from the Pecos River to the Rio Grande, south into northern
Mexico and north to the Sacramento Mountains (Opler and Opler 1950:2). Apache groups in New Mexico and presumably the western Trans-Pecos are believed to have acquired horses sometime between
1600 and 1638 (Clark 1966:7).
A number of the historic rock images at Hueco Tanks are thought to have been painted by Mescalero Apache Indians (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Sutherland 1975:77-78, 1995:23-24). These figures are fluid and curvilinear (Sutherland 1995:23), and often are executed in a thick white pigment
(Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:199). They include lively dancers with rabbit-eared or feathered headdresses (Figure 50a) and individuals engaged in sexual acts, possibly depicting victory celebration rites
(Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:194), fertility dances (Toness 1974:8), or Mountain Spirit dances (Ferg
and Kessel 1987:109; Schaafsma 1980a:336). Other possible Mescalero Apache images at Hueco Tanks
include shield motifs, figures holding shields or guns (Figure 50b), crosses, horses, and large white snakes
with red, yellow, and black details (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:200; Schaafsma 1980a:336; Seymour
2002:238). Comb-like images resembling jellyfish and lizard-like figures also have been attributed to
Mescalero Apaches (Toness 1974:8, 21). At site E06A, a sun shield motif encircling a serrated square that
contains an upward-pointing wavy arrow is meaningful to present-day Mescalero Apache, but also has
been patented as a trademark by the Tigua Indians of Ysleta del Sur Pueblo.
The shield motifs and snake figures attributed to Mescalero Apache Indians may be associated with
fertility and/or water (Toness 1974:8). The horned serpent is the patron deity of rivers and underground water among Pueblo Indians, while snakes and lightning symbolize rain and hence fertility
(The Collectorâs Guide 2009). Other tribes also associate serpents with earth openings, springs, and
water (Simmons 1942:17; Grinnell 1961:170-178). Cherokee Indians consider snakes to be supernatural, having an intimate connection with rain and thunder gods and influence over other animals and
plants (Varner 2007:126). The snake figures at Hueco Tanks could represent healing, for snakes were
used in Apache curing ceremonies like the Mountain Spirit ceremony (Polly Schaafsma, personal communication 2002). Mescalero Apache shield motifs may be water/fertility symbols if their associations
are similar to the netted hoop of the Plains or the water shield of the Southwest (Hall 1985:190). Some
Native Americans associate netted shields with spider webs, which are natural moisture traps (Dorsey
1969:Figure 20, Note 145). Netted hoops also were used in rituals to promote the fertility of bison herds
(Hall 1985:190). Serrations or rows of triangles like those on shield images at Hueco Tanks are said to
represent rain (Ferg and Kessel 1987:142).
Cross-like figures in rock imagery site E06E at Hueco Tanks may represent stars like those at Puebloan
and Navajo rock imagery sites in New Mexico and Arizona (Schaafsma 1980a:322-324), and also as far
away as Big Bend Ranch State Park. The cross-like figures in site E06E are likely to be associated with
Mescalero Apache Indians, however, because most of the images in that panel appear to be Mescalero,
including the white dancing figures. The Mescalero Apache continue to hold ceremonies at the Tanks
today, including the Dance of the Mountain Spirits. Celestial imagery and symbolism may have been
adopted from Puebloan communities by the Navajo and Apache on their arrival in the region, or the
imagery could have developed separately among these Athapascan groups. Celestial figures continue to
hold importance to Native American communities in the region today. For example, the sacred drum
of Ysleta del Sur Pueblo depicts a moon with a face and eight stars arrayed around it on one end (Ortiz
1999) and a five-pointed star on the opposite end (Houser 1979:337; Ysleta del Sur Pueblo 2000:25, 30).
The age of the Mescalero Apache imagery at Hueco Tanks can be assessed by means of the
shieldâbearer figures as well as historical accounts. The static warriors with body shields at the Tanks
are similar to Northern Plains rock imagery that is thought to date between A.D. 1000 and 1700 (Keyser
1989:88). Along the northern Rio Grande valley and in the Galisteo Basin of New Mexico, shield-bearer

Rock Imagery

figures that often are found in association with celestial rock imagery consistently postdate A.D. 1300,
and are associated with Rio Grande Style imagery or later Gobernador-phase Navajo figures (Schaafsma
and Schaafsma 1974:542, 1990, 1992:114). Large shields like those depicted at Hueco Tanks were used by
Apaches in the 1690s (Griffen 1979:40). Historic records place Apache people at Hueco Tanks in 1692,
when Spanish forces were guided to the Tanks by an Apache Indian and met with other Apaches nearby,
who stated that the area was their hunting ground (De Vargas 1692; see Historical Background section).
Given these associations, it seems likely that the first Mescalero Apache pictographs at Hueco Tanks
had been painted by 1700. The guns held by some of the Mescalero Apache figures unfortunately lack
sufficient detail to refine the age of those images, but the most recent Mescalero Apache pictographs at
the Tanks could date to the late 1800s. After the Mescalero Apaches were released from Bosque Redondo
in 1865, they occupied the Guadalupe Mountains and adjacent areas along the Rio Grande (Basehart
1974:89). As recently as the 1920s and 1930s, Apaches visited Hueco Tanks to trade horses with the
Escontrias family (Turner 1984), but they are not known to have created any images at that time.
Some or all of the rock imagery at sites E01, E02, E06, N15, N17G, N18, and SE26 is thought to be
associated with Mescalero Apache Indians. Most of these sites are concentrated around the pass between
East and North Mountains.
Kiowa
Rock imagery site E01A (Figure 51) may have been produced for narrative purposes, to depict a
ten-day siege that occurred at Hueco Tanks in 1839. As Kiowa informants related to ethnographer James
Mooney, a small party of Kiowa warriors stopped for the night at a place where a spring came out of a
cave (Mooney 1898:302), thought to be in Hueco Tanks at the head of a deep canyon that cuts into the
north side of East Mountain (Sharp 1987:87-88; 1998:14-18). The band was pursued and surrounded
by Mexican soldiers and Mescalero Apache scouts, who trapped them in the cave without food or water.
After 10 days of confinement the Kiowa warriors escaped from the cave after dark, climbing up a cedar
tree that grew on the side of the canyon (Mooney 1898:303-305, 329). Other accounts of this episode

207

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

differ (Binion 1970:39; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:180). A member of the Pope topographical survey
party reported that around 100 Apaches had been held captive at Hueco Tanks by Mexican forces in
1840, and were almost entirely exterminated (Byrne 1855:69). Tigua elders recalled that the scouts who
accompanied the Mexican soldiers were Tiguas (Green 1974:83-84; Houser 1979:339-340).
According to Martineau (1973:69-83) and a present-day Kiowa informant (Dewey Tsonetokoy Jr.,
personal communication 1999), the rock imagery at site E01A at Hueco Tanks depicts the 1839 Kiowa
battle. Some have questioned why the pictographs were not drawn in the Biographic Style, an illustrated
narrative style of Plains Indian groups that came into use around 1775, however (Keyser 1989). Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:202) suspected that the figures in Western attire at site E01A were
Mescalero Apache depictions. The large white snake and hourglass-shaped human form resemble common elements in Mescalero Apache imagery of the Guadalupe Mountains (Bilbo and Bilbo 1991:50)
and other sites in southern New Mexico (Polly Schaafsma, personal communication 2002). Site E01A
may incorporate images created by several native groups during the historic period.
Tigua of Ysleta del Sur Pueblo
As discussed, a sun shield image at Hueco Tanks rock imagery site E06A has been claimed by the
Tigua Indians of Ysleta del Sur Pueblo as well as the Mescalero Apaches, and recently was patented as the
trademark of Ysleta del Sur Pueblo. The Tiguas assert that the wavy line in this image represents the Rio
Grande and the arrow indicates the direction of Isleta, their place of origin. The serrated square inside
the circle of the sun is said to represent âyellow houseâ, the part of Isleta east of the Rio Grande that was
the original home of the Tigua (Greenberg 1999). The Tigua see this image as a narrative, illustrating
the history of their immigration from the Pueblo de Isleta to Ysleta del Sur.
Several names marked in black paint below the sun shield image apparently are Tigua individuals
(Alex Mares, personal communication 2001); one is dated Octubre [October] 1900. Additional Tigua
family names dating back to the turn of the century are inscribed in other rockshelters and caves at
Hueco Tanks (Gerald 1974a:59-60; Gray 1995:69).
In recent years the Tigua Indians have claimed the Jornada Style mask paintings at Hueco Tanks as
symbols of their abuelos or tribal protectors (Greenberg 1999:9), represented in Tigua ceremonies by men
wearing bison hide masks (Houser 1979:337, 339). The mask pictographs at Hueco Tanks are stylistically
distinct from prehistoric and historic Pueblo masks in the historic homeland of the Tigua on the upper
Rio Grande, however (Schaafsma 1980a:256). It would be expected that the Rio Grande Style would be
evident in the depiction of abuelos at Hueco Tanks. Although other groups such as the Manso have been
proposed as descendants of the people who produced Jornada Style rock imagery (Beckett and Corbett 1992:39-48), the Tigua are among the many Pueblo communities that are distant heirs to the ideas
expressed in Jornada Style masks and other iconography at Hueco Tanks. Despite stylistic differences, the
similarity in iconography continued from the late Formative period to modern-day pueblos.
Biographic Style
The Biographic Style is a narrative imagery style of the northern Plains that was well developed by
the mid-nineteenth century (Keyser 1989). Biographic Style imagery on the southern Plains was less
complex (Polly Schaafsma, personal communication 2002). Possible Biographic Style figures at Hueco

208

Rock Imagery

Tanks consist of images rather than scenes, such as a horse with rider at site E01H (Figure 52). Additional
horse images that may be attributed to this style include a horse at N15D with a possible scalp lock
(Keyser 1987:57-58; 1991) hanging from its lower jaw or bridle, and a horse at E25A with a fringed
bridle decoration (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:199) that may represent a scalp (Keyser 1991) or a
chin-plate with jingles. Individuals shooting arrows from bows while other arrows fly by are depicted at
sites N17G and W20D (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967:190). The vertical alignment of figures at W20D
resembles ledger drawings of the late nineteenth century (American Pictographic Images 1988:Plates
128, 130, 144).
The possible Biographic Style pictographs at Hueco Tanks might have been painted in the late eighteenth and/or nineteenth centuries (Polly Schaafsma, personal communication 2002). Comanche or
Kiowa Indians are the most likely candidates, as bands from both tribes are reported to have traveled
through the area (Jackson 1938:323; Mooney 1898:Plate LXXIII).

Figure 52. Possible Biographic Style image at E01H.

SUMMARY
While the first abstract rock imagery may have been painted on the rocks of Hueco Tanks several
thousands of years ago, the tradition of placing images at this site continued well into the nineteenth
century. Although some figures capture everyday activities such as hunting, many apparently refer to
the water in the caves, crevices, and hollows that probably inspired all who visited the Tanks to view the
locale as a sacred place. Present-day Native American communities continue to view the rock imagery
and landscape of Hueco Tanks as meaningful and essential components of their heritage and history.

MATERIALS RECOVERED

by Logan McNatt, Margaret Howard, and Amy Ringstaff

A total of 4,098 artifacts were analyzed in conjunction with the current investigations at Hueco
Tanks State Park and Historic Site. The 3,657 items collected in 1999 and 2001 comprise almost 90
percent of this collection; the remaining 441 artifacts were collected by visitors and park staff prior to
2001 at documented locations that could be identified to locality (see Methods of Archeological Investigations section). These earlier collections were included in the current analyses to obtain additional
information on the span of occupation of Hueco Tanks, and the activities conducted there.
The 3,507 prehistoric ceramic sherds and chipped stone artifacts comprise around 85 percent of this
collection, and were the primary focus of analyses. Other items dating to the prehistoric period include
small quantities of ground stone, heat spalls, fiber artifacts, and worked shell. Historic artifacts (n =
277) make up only 7 percent of the collection. Faunal remains and fossils include both prehistoric and
historic specimens, and together constitute around 6 percent of the collection.
The ceramics were analyzed by Amy Ringstaff, Margaret Howard, and Eric Morley; Logan McNatt
analyzed the remainder of the collection. The faunal remains were identified by Brian Shaffer (see
Appendix D). Many other individuals provided expert advice on the identification of particular artifacts
and materials, and are credited in those sections. These artifacts and materials are permanently curated
in the Archeology Laboratory of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in Austin.

PREHISTORIC CERAMICS
This sample of prehistoric ceramics from Hueco Tanks consists of 1,088 sherds and one whole vessel. Most of the sherds are identified as undifferentiated El Paso Brownware (n = 457, 42 percent; Table
25). El Paso Polychrome is the second most abundant analytical category (n = 277, 25 percent), followed
by Chupadero Black-on-white (n = 90, 8 percent), undifferentiated El Paso painted (n = 89, 8 percent),
and untyped plain (n = 81, 7 percent). The remaining 104 sherds are distributed across 16 analytical
categories, each accounting for 2 percent or less of the ceramic sample.
Most of the sherds were recovered during the current investigations (n = 902, 83 percent); the
remaining 186 sherds and the whole vessel are from the park collection. The vast majority of the ceramics (n = 907, 83 percent) were collected from surface contexts, and the remaining 182 sherds were recovered from shovel tests. Twenty-seven of the 29 localities are represented in this ceramic sample, the
exceptions being ES3 and NE3. NW4 produced the largest ceramic sample of any locality (n = 406, 37
percent of the ceramics); those sherds were collected because they appeared to be from several vessels
that might be reconstructable. CA5 produced the second highest number of sherds (n = 108, 10 percent
of the ceramics), 68 (63 percent) of which are from the park collection. The smallest samples come from
three localitiesâES1, NE4, and WS4âthat yielded only two sherds apiece (see Table 25).

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Materials Recovered

The ceramic analysis was designed to obtain information on chronology, interregional interaction,
and as possible, subsistence. Typological identification was the main objective, because ceramic types
have both chronological and geographic significance. The ceramics were classified with reference to
established typologies by Stallings (1931), Cosgrove and Cosgrove (1932), Lehmer (1948), Hawley
(1950), Miller (1995), and others. The ceramic comparative collection at the Texas Archeology Research
Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin also was used to ascertain type identifications based on
decoration and other visual criteria. Substantial assistance with type identification was obtained from
Myles Miller of Geo-Marine Inc. and Dr. Darrell Creel of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
at The University of Texas at Austin. Ceramics that could not be identified to type were sorted into
descriptive categories.
Interregional interaction was also examined through instrumental neutron activation analysis
(INAA) of 24 sherds collected during the current investigations, conducted by the Research Reactor
Center of the University of Missouri-Columbia. Coarse sand from Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic
Site also was submitted for INAA due to its resemblance to El Paso Brownware temper. Existing INAA
data on 24 sherds from previous investigations at Hueco Tanks were included in the analysis.
Subsistence information was sought by means of vessel form identification (bowl or jar), orifice
diameter, and rim form. For the El Paso Brownware, rim form was quantified by means of the rim sherd
index (Seaman and Mills 1988; West 1982).
Methods of Ceramic Analysis
The ceramics were analyzed by Amy Ringstaff, Eric Morley, and Margaret Howard. Within each type
and descriptive category the sherds were sorted by vessel part, defined as rim, near-rim, handle, or body.
Near-rim sherds do not include the vessel lip but are recognizable by their curvature. Sherds from the
same provenience that fit together were treated as a single specimen.
Form of the parent vesselâbowl or jarâwas determined by sherd curvature, surface treatment,
and decoration, based on the assumption that bowl sherds have smoothed and/or decorated concave
interiors while jar sherds have smoothed and/or decorated convex exteriors (for exceptions see Miller
1989:184-185). Vessel form could not be determined for 315 sherds (29 percent of the sample) due to
their small size, eroded condition, or ambiguous curvature. Vessel orifice diameter was estimated for
sherds retaining at least a 20 mm long section of the lip, by matching the curve of the rim against concentric circles of known diameters.
Paste color was recorded for the side of each sherd that appeared to be most representative, i.e.,
least obscured by erosion, fire cloud, and/or decoration. The color of the paste was determined through
comparison to reference chips on pages 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR of the Munsell (2000) Soil Color
Charts. Ten color categories initially were established but only seven were used: light brown, reddish
brown, brown, grayish brown, gray, white, and yellow (Table 26). Sherds that had been blackened due to
reduced firing conditions and/or soot were not coded for paste color.
Temper was identified by viewing the surfaces and edges of each sherd under 10x binocular magnification. Eight temper categories were defined: crushed rock, sand, sherd fragments (grog), mica, crushed
rock and mica, crushed rock and sand, crushed rock/sand/mica, and other. In most cases, the sand
grains probably were natural constituents of the clays selected for pottery making. Mica also could have
been an incidental or natural inclusion, so sherds were recorded as mica tempered only when they contained fairly large quantities of platy particles with a pearly or metallic appearance.

Predominant finishing treatments on the interior and exterior surfaces of each sherd were recorded.
Interior and exterior were distinguished primarily by curvature, along with the known exterior/interior surface treatments for particular types. Four categories of surface treatment were defined: scraped/
scored, smoothed, floated, and burnished/polished (Rice 1987:137-138, 151). Surface treatment was
coded as unknown for very small specimens, eroded surfaces, surfaces obscured by decoration, and/
or sherds for which interior and exterior sides could not be distinguished. Decorations were coded as
incised, punctated, corrugated, slipped, painted, and/or a combination of these attributes. The range of
vessel wall thickness for each type was approximated by measuring grab samples of visually thick and
thin sherds with calipers.
Local Ceramics
Of the 1,089 specimens examined in this study, 876 sherds and the complete vessel (80 percent of
the sample) are classified as El Paso Brownware (see Table 25) and probably were manufactured in the
Hueco Bolson (Creel, Williams, Neff, and Glascock 2002:43). They are divided into El Paso Brown rim
sherds (n = 23, 2 percent of the sample), undifferentiated El Paso Brownware body sherds (n = 457, 42
percent), El Paso Bichrome sherds (n = 5, <1 percent), El Paso Polychrome sherds (n = 277, 25 percent),
El Paso Polychrome Transitional sherds (n = 6, <1 percent), El Paso Polychrome Classic sherds (n = 20,
2 percent), and undifferentiated El Paso painted sherds (n = 89, 8 percent of the sample).
El Paso Brown
Twenty-three undecorated rim sherds (2 percent of the ceramic sample) are identified to the El Paso
Brown type (Lehmer 1948:94). El Paso Brown ceramics appeared in the Mesilla phase, and their manufacture continued into the DoÃ±a Ana phase (A.D. 200/600 through 1000/1100; Miller 1995:212). Seven
sherds come from the park collection and 16 were collected during the current investigations, 14 from
the surface and 2 from shovel tests. CA2 is the locality best represented by El Paso Brown rim sherds (n
= 8), the remainder coming from 7 other localities (see Table 25).
Paste colors of the El Paso Brown sherds are brown (n = 10), reddish brown (n = 8), grayish brown
(n = 4) and light brown (n = 1), falling within the reported range of variation for this type (e.g., Lehmer
1948:94; Runyan and Hedrick 1973:21). All but one of the sherds are tempered with crushed rock and
sand, and the other is tempered with crushed rock, sand, and mica. The prominence, size, angularity,
and profusion of crushed rock particles are typical of El Paso Brown (Lehmer 1948:94).
Eighteen El Paso Brown rim sherds come from jars, and the vessel form of the remaining five could
not be discerned. Eleven large rim sherds could be further identified as coming from neckless jars/tecomates (n = 7) or necked jars (n = 4) according to Millerâs (1995:213) El Paso Brown vessel taxonomy.
The jar is the most common vessel form for this type, and bowls are rarely found (Lehmer 1948:94).
Thirteen rim sherds are large enough to estimate orifice diameter, which ranges from 12 to 37 cm; the
mean orifice diameter is 21.3 cm and the median is 18 cm. Vessel wall thickness ranges from 4.5 to 8.8
mm and is typical for El Paso Brown (Lehmer 1948:94; Whalen 1977:154).
Surface treatment of the El Paso Brown rim sherds varies, and seven sherds are too eroded to identify this attribute. Exterior surfaces are primarily smoothed (n = 10); burnished/polished (n = 2) and
floated surfaces (n = 3) are less common, and the remaining sherd has a lightly scraped/scored exterior.

215

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Most of the interior surfaces are smoothed (n = 9), while 5 sherds have scraped/scored interiors and 2
sherds have floated interiors. Smoothing is reportedly the most common surface treatment on exterior
and interior surfaces of El Paso Brown sherds, though there is considerable range in the degree of its
application (Lehmer 1948:94). Scrape marks and bumpy finishes are typical, while finely finished surfaces are less common (Whalen 1978:60).
One El Paso Brown rim sherd has been modified; the broken edge opposite the rim is rounded from
abrasion.
Undifferentiated El Paso Brownware
Undifferentiated El Paso Brownware consists of 457 undecorated body sherds (42 percent of the
sample) that may come from El Paso Plain Brown vessels or the lower, undecorated part of El Paso
Bichrome or Polychrome vessels. They are identified as El Paso Brownware primarily due to their distinctive temper (Lehmer 1948:94), but also by their paste color and surface treatment. These brownware
sherds are assigned broadly to the Formative period, including the Mesilla (A.D. 200 to 1000), DoÃ±a Ana
(A.D. 1000 to 1300), and El Paso (A.D. 1300 to 1450) phases.
Among the 20 analytical categories in the ceramic sample, undifferentiated El Paso Brownware
sherds were recovered in the greatest quantity. Of the 457 sherds in this category, 260 were collected
from the surface during the current investigations, 130 were recovered from shovel tests, and 67 come
from the park collection. Almost half of the sherds (n = 225) were collected from the surface of NW4
because they appeared to be from several vessels that might be reconstructable (efforts were unsuccessful). The remaining sherds come from 20 other localities (see Table 25).
Paste color of the undifferentiated El Paso Brownware sherds is most commonly brown (n = 219),
followed by reddish brown (n = 114), light brown (n = 64), grayish brown (n = 40), gray (n = 18), and
yellow (n = 2). All of the sherds are tempered with crushed rock; the most commonly identified temper
class is crushed rock and sand (n = 371), followed by crushed rock (n = 43), crushed rock/sand/mica (n
= 30), and crushed rock/mica (n = 13).
The vessel form most commonly represented in the undifferentiated El Paso Brownware ceramics is the
jar (n = 223); 22 sherds are from bowls, and the vessel form of the remaining 212 sherds could not be identified. Vessel wall thickness of the undifferentiated El Paso Brownware sherds ranges from 2.2 to 8.4 mm.
Almost half of the undifferentiated El Paso Brownware sherds (n = 200) have eroded interiors on
which surface treatment cannot be discerned. Smoothed interior surfaces were identified on 176 sherds,
floated surfaces on 45 sherds, scraped/scored interiors on 31 sherds, and burnished/polished surfaces on
5 sherds. Exterior surfaces also are mostly eroded (n = 182), followed by smoothed (n = 142), floated (n
= 82), burnished/polished (n = 46), and scraped/scored (n = 5).
Four undifferentiated El Paso Brownware sherds have been modified. Two are drilled disks, one is a
drilled disk fragment, and one has an abraded edge.
El Paso Bichrome
Five sherds classified as El Paso Bichrome (Human Systems Research 1973:332; Runyan and Hedrick
1973:25-26) were collected during the current investigations from the surface of five localities: CA5 and

216

Materials Recovered

7, SB4 and SB7, and WS3 (see Table 25). El Paso Bichrome ceramics were made between A.D. 800/1000
and A.D. 1100/1250, in the latter part of the Mesilla phase and the DoÃ±a Ana phase (Miller 1995:212214).
Paste colors of the El Paso Bichrome sherds range from grayish brown (n = 3) to reddish brown
(n = 1) to brown (n = 1), falling within the reported range for El Paso Bichrome (Runyan and Hedrick
1987:31). Three Bichrome sherds are tempered with crushed rock and sand, and two are tempered with
crushed rock, sand, and mica.
Three of the El Paso Bichrome specimens are rim sherds, one is a near-rim sherd, and one is a body
sherd. Four sherds come from jars and the vessel form of the fifth could not be determined. Orifice
diameter was estimated for two rim sherds, the third being too small to make a determination. Diameters are 17 and 18 cm, yielding a mean and median diameter of 17.5 cm. Vessel wall thickness ranges
from 4.8 to 7.4 mm, within the general parameters reported for Bichrome sherds (Runyan and Hedrick
1973:25).
The El Paso Bichrome sherds do not exhibit much variation in surface treatment. The interior of
three sherds is smoothed, while the interior of the other sherds is too eroded to identify surface treatment. Exterior surfaces of four sherds are smoothed, and paint obscures the exterior of the fifth.
These sherds are typed as El Paso Bichrome because they are rim sherds and/or are large enough
to assess with some confidence that two colors of paint were not used. The type name is misleading, as
these ceramics actually are monochromatic (Carmichael 1986a:66; Miller 1995:211). Four sherds are
decorated with red paint and one with black paint; red designs are more common than black among
Bichrome vessels (Miller 1995:214), but the red pigment can be fugitive (Runyan and Hedrick 1973:26).
Limited information on design is available due to the small size of these sherds and their faint pigment,
but their decoration appears to be typical, consisting of lines (Stallings 1932:74) and areas of pigment.
The rim sherd from SB4 has diagonal lines appended from a rim band, similar to designs reported for
this type (Miller 1995:214).
El Paso Polychrome
El Paso Polychrome is the second most common analytical category; the 303 sherds identified to
this type (including Transitional and Classic variants) comprise 28 percent of the ceramic sample. This
total includes the single complete vessel, which is from the park collection. Almost 86 percent of the El
Paso Polychrome sherds were recovered during the current investigations from the surface (n = 240)
or shovel tests (n = 18), and 45 were gleaned from the park collection. NW4 yielded the most El Paso
Polychrome sherds (n = 82), with the second greatest quantity coming from SB6 (n = 51); the remaining
specimens are distributed across 21 other localities (see Table 25).
With the assistance of Myles Miller, 26 El Paso Polychrome sherds were identified to the Transitional
(n = 6) and Classic (n = 20) variants. Transitional and Classic specimens are considered separately, following discussion of the ceramics typed simply as El Paso Polychrome, unspecified variant.
The 277 El Paso Polychrome unspecified ceramics date to the DoÃ±a Ana and El Paso phases, between
A.D. 1000/1100 and 1450 (Miller 1995:212). The most common paste color is grayish brown (n = 128),
followed by gray (n = 113), reddish brown (n = 18), brown (n = 15), and light brown (n = 3). Temper
is overwhelmingly crushed rock and sand (n = 252, 91 percent), followed by crushed rock/sand/mica
(n = 18), sand (n = 4), and crushed rock (n = 3). This range of paste colors and tempering materials is
common for El Paso Polychrome ceramics (Runyan and Hedrick 1973:27; Stallings 1931:3).
217

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Most of the 277 El Paso Polychrome unspecified ceramics are body sherds (n = 209); 57 are rim
sherds, 10 are near-rim sherds, and 1 is a complete bowl. Within the 276 sherds the most common
vessel form is the jar (n = 202); 31 sherds come from bowls, and form could not be determined for 43
sherds due to ambiguous curvature or small size. Jars predominate among El Paso Polychrome vessels,
though bowls were also made (Lehmer 1948:46; Stallings 1931:4). Orifice diameter was determined for
39 sherds and the bowl; the remaining 18 rim sherds were too small to measure this attribute accurately.
The range of orifice diameters is 8 to 40 cm, with an average of 21.3 cm and a median of 20 cm. Vessel
wall thickness ranges from 3.0 to 6.9 mm, within the normal range for this type (Runyan and Hedrick
1973:27; Stallings 1931:4).
Interior surface treatments on the 277 unspecified El Paso Polychrome specimens are varied.
Smoothing is most common (n = 115); 38 sherds are floated, 7 have burnished/polished surfaces, and 6
sherds are scraped/scored. Erosion or paint obscures the interior surface of 111 sherds. Exterior surface
treatments are less diverse, though most (n = 182) could not be determined due to erosion or paint.
Smoothed surfaces were observed on 66 sherds, 21 specimens are floated, and 8 sherds are burnished/
polished. Runyan and Hedrick (1973:28) note that decorated surfaces of these ceramics typically are
more finely finished.
The El Paso Polychrome unspecified sherds are decorated, often crudely, with red and black paint.
Most sherds are too small to determine design motifs. Common elements evident on larger sherds and
rims include alternating red and black stripes (Figure 53a, b), chevrons (Figure 53c), and areas of solid

massed color. Rims typically are painted red, with horizontal black stripes below them on interior and/
or exterior, or black vertical lines appended from the rim intersecting horizontal black stripes, with red
paint massed between them (Figure 53d, e). These designs resemble those reported for El Paso Polychrome (e.g., Miller 1995:214-216; Runyan and Hedrick 1973:28; Stallings 1931:5-6).
Three El Paso Polychrome unspecified rim sherds have been modified. The lip of one sherd is
abraded, and another rim sherd retains part of a drilled hole. The third modified rim sherd has two
abraded edges.
The single complete vessel in the collection is a small, hemispherical El Paso Polychrome bowl
from the park collection recovered from NE1. The bowl is 48 cm tall, its orifice diameter is 8 cm, and
its volume is around 169 ml. Vessel wall thickness ranges from 3.2 to 5.1 mm, and the base is rounded.
Rim orientation is slightly inverted. The paste of the bowl is grayish brown (10YR5/2); crushed rock
particles are visible but temper cannot be fully determined as there are no broken edges. The exterior
surface is floated and partially obscured by travertine, with two red slashes adjoining the rim in one
area. Red paint also covers the flattened rim. The interior of the bowl is smoothed. Interior decoration
consists of red lines delineating triangular to crescent-shaped areas of black pigment (Figure 54). The
overall design appears somewhat zoomorphic and resembles a turtle shell. Although the bowl is typed
as El Paso Polychrome unspecified, Myles Miller (personal communication 2003) suspects that it dates
after A.D. 1150 based on the decoration.
Six sherds (less than 1 percent of the sample) were identified to the Transitional variant of El Paso
Polychrome with the assistance of Myles Miller. Transitional El Paso Polychrome ceramics were made
in the DoÃ±a Ana phase, between
A.D. 1000/1100 and 1250 (Miller
1995:212). One sherd from SB3
comes from the park collection,
and five were collected during the
current investigations from the
surface of CA2, NW2, SB6, and
WS1 and WS3 (see Table 25).
Paste colors of the El Paso
Polychrome Transitional sherds
are gray (n = 2), reddish brown (n
= 2), grayish brown (n = 1), and
brown (n = 1). Five sherds are
tempered with crushed rock and
sand, and the other is tempered
with crushed rock, sand, and
mica. Five Transitional speciÂ­mens
are body sherds. The single rim
sherd has the slightly thickened
rim and flat lip that are typical of
early El Paso Polychrome (Way
1979:44; Whalen 1981a:223),
and its curvature represents an
orifice diameter of 16 cm. Five
specimens are jar sherds and one
comes from a bowl. Vessel wall

thickness ranges from 4.5 to 5.2 mm. Despite the small sample, five interior surface treatments are represented: scraped/scored, smoothed, floated (n = 2), burnished/polished, and eroded/obscured. Exterior
surface treatment was difficult to observe: five sherds have eroded or obscured exterior surfaces, while
the sixth has a smoothed exterior. The sherds are decorated with red and black paint in designs consistent with the Transitional variant (Miller 1989:186-190; 1995:214), including nested chevrons (Figure
55a), stepped frets (Figure 55b), and black and red lines paralleling the rim (Figure 55c). The Transitional rim sherd has been modified by a hole drilled near the lip.
The Classic variant of El Paso Polychrome is represented by 20 sherds identified with the assistance
of Myles Miller based on their characteristic everted rims and thickened lips, and/or distinctive design
elements (Miller 1995:214-215). The Classic variant of this type dates almost entirely to the El Paso

phase, between A.D. 1250 and 1450 (Miller 1995:212). Six of these sherds were culled from the park
collection, and the remaining 14 were collected from the surface during the current investigations. The
Classic sherds are distributed across 11 localities (see Table 25), with the greatest quantity coming from
WS2 (n = 4). Most of the paste colors are shades of brown (eight grayish brown, three light brown,
three brown, and two reddish brown), while four specimens have gray paste. Temper is overwhelmingly
crushed rock and sand (n = 18), but two sherds are tempered solely with crushed rock.
Eleven of the El Paso Polychrome Classic sherds are rim sherds and nine are body sherds. Eighteen
sherds were determined to come from jars, one is from a bowl, and the vessel form of the last sherd
could not be determined. Interior surface treatment is primarily smoothed (n = 11); others are scraped/
scored (n = 2), floated (n = 2), or burnished/polished (n = 1), and 4 sherds have eroded or obscured
surfaces. Exterior surface treatment is rarely preserved; 16 sherds have eroded exterior surfaces, while 3
are smoothed and 1 is floated.
Orifice diameter was determined for 10 of the 11 El Paso Polychrome Classic rim sherds, excluding 1 small specimen. The diameters range from 12 to 40 cm, the mean is 22.9 cm, and the median is
23.5 cm. Vessel wall thickness ranges from 3.7 to 6.4 mm. The design elements are typical of the El Paso
Polychrome Classic variant (Miller 1995:215-216), including alternating red and black parallel bands
(Figure 56a), opposed black stepped frets bracketing red fields (Figure 56b, c), and black squares filled
with red (Figure 56d, e).
Undifferentiated El Paso Painted
Sherds classified as undifferentiated El Paso painted exhibit the temper, paste color, and surface
treatments of El Paso Brownware and bear either red or black paint, but are not large enough to be classified as El Paso Bichrome or Polychrome. They date to a relatively broad span of time extending from
the Mesilla phase through the El Paso phase (A.D. 800/1000 to 1450; Miller 1995:212).
Eighty-nine sherds (8 percent of the ceramic sample) are classed as undifferentiated El Paso painted
ware. During the current investigations, 67 of these sherds were collected from the surface and 14 were
recovered from shovel tests; the remaining 8 sherds were gleaned from the park collection. Over half
of these sherds (n = 46) were collected from NW4, the remainder coming from 14 other localities (see
Table 25).
Paste color of the El Paso painted ceramics is predominantly grayish brown (n = 52), with lesser
numbers of brown (n = 14), reddish brown (n = 13), gray (n = 9), and light brown (n = 1) sherds. Temper is overwhelmingly crushed rock and sand (n = 77); eight sherds are tempered with crushed rock/
sand/mica, two with sand alone, and two are tempered solely with crushed rock.
Over 90 percent of the undifferentiated El Paso painted ceramics are body sherds (n = 82), 6 are small
rim sherds, and 1 is a near rim. Fifty-five sherds are jar fragments, bowls are represented by 9 sherds, and
the vessel form of 25 sherds could not be determined. Vessel wall thickness ranges from 3.2 to 8.4 mm.
Orifice diameters were determined for three rim sherds, the remaining four being too small to yield an
accurate estimate. Diameters range from 12 to 20 cm, with a mean of 15.7 cm and a median of 15 cm.
Interior surface treatment of the El Paso painted sherds is difficult to observe, as the interior surfaces of 50 sherds are eroded or obscured by paint. Smoothed interior surfaces were found on 26 sherds,
floated surfaces on 6 sherds, 4 sherds were scraped/scored, and 3 sherds were burnished/polished. Exterior surfaces also are mostly eroded or obscured (n = 39), while the remainder are smoothed (n = 32),
floated (n = 11), or burnished/polished (n = 7).

El Paso Brownware Rim Sherd Attributes
El Paso Brownware vessels generally evolved from neckless jars and bowls with pinched inverted
rims, to jars and bowls with direct flattened rims, to necked jars and bowls with everted, thickened rims
(Lehmer 1948:37, 79; Miller 2004:253; Whalen 1978:59-70, 1981a). The Rim Sherd Index (RSI) was
developed by Kenneth West (1982) to quantify these variations in rim form. The index is calculated by
measuring the vessel wall thickness of rim sherds at 2 mm and 15 mm below the lip, and dividing the
former measure by the latter (West 1982:17-19; cf. Miller 1996e:77-79). A rim sherd index of less than
1.0 indicates a pinched rim, an index around 1.0 represents a direct rim, and an index greater than 1.0
identifies a thickened rim.
This index has been employed to examine evolution of rim form in El Paso Brownware ceramics
from sites dating to different phases (Carmichael 1985, 1986; West 1982). Seaman and Mills (1988:169170) considered vessel form and rim eversion in conjunction with RSI, noting that evolution of jar rim
shape may not have paralleled changes in bowl rim morphology, and that rim eversion represents vessel
form more directly than rim finish. They and others have recognized the inherent circularity of using
RSI to compare ceramic assemblages dated on the basis of rim form (Seaman and Mills 1988:170).
The relatively small sample of typed El Paso Brownware rims from Hueco Tanks comes largely from
surficial contexts and lacks precise dates, so RSI measures of these specimens are best viewed as quantifications of rim form. Other rim sherd attributes also are of interest, and can be compared to samples
from the region. In terms of vessel forms represented by the Hueco Tanks rim sherds, jars comprise from
77 to 100 percent of the samples of each El Paso Brownware type (Table 27), mirroring distributions
observed in other collections from the Jornada area (e.g., Lehmer 1948:46, 94; Miller 1995:212-214).
The increase in mean orifice diameter of El Paso Brownware over time that has been proposed
by Whalen (1978:59-63, 1980:31-37, 1981a), Miller (1995:213-214), and others is partially supported
by the Hueco Tanks sample (see Table 27). The relatively numerous El Paso Brown and Polychrome
unspecified samples yielded equivalent mean orifice diameters, which are exceeded by the mean orifice
diameter of the Polychrome Classic sample. The smaller Bichrome and Transitional samples do not
follow this trend. The range of orifice diameters in the three large samples indicates the presence of a
few large-mouthed vessels (ca. 37 to 40 cm orifice diameter) in ceramic assemblages from early (El Paso
Brown) through late (El Paso Polychrome Classic) contexts. Such large vessels are likely to have served
as storage facilities, due to the difficulty of moving them (Seaman and Mills 1988:180-182).
RSI values were calculated for 72 El Paso Brownware rim sherds and one vessel from the Hueco
Tanks ceramic sample. Information on intra-vessel variation in RSI was available from the small El
Paso Polychrome unspecified bowl. Its 25 cm long rim was divided into eight roughly equal quadrants,
and vessel wall thickness at those points was measured with an outside micrometer. Thickness at 2 mm
below the rim had an unexpectedly large range of 3.2 to 4.4 mm, while thickness variation at 15 mm
below the rim was smaller, ranging from 4.3 to 5.1 mm. RSI calculations for the bowl range from 0.65
to 1.00, indicating that the rim varies from pinched to direct. While such variation can be expected
in hand-built vessels, it does point out the inherent limitations of accurate vessel characterization by
means of sherds representing a fraction of their orifices.
The RSI values for the El Paso Brownware types from Hueco Tanks generally follow the regional
transition from pinched to direct to thickened rim forms (see Table 27). Differences in RSI values for
jars and bowls can be compared for El Paso Polychrome unspecified and El Paso Polychrome Classic.
The El Paso Polychrome unspecified jar rims exhibit greater thickening than bowl rims, at a similar
magnitude to differences in RSI values for El Paso painted jars and bowls from White Sands Missile

Nonlocal Ceramics
Of the 1,089 specimens in the ceramic sample from Hueco Tanks, 123 (11 percent) are identified to
types that probably were manufactured outside the Hueco Bolson. The most abundant nonlocal type
is Chupadero Black-on-white (n = 90; 8 percent). Three other nonlocal types each constitute around
1 percent of the sample: Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta (n = 10), various Mimbres styles (n = 9), and
Playas Red (n = 9). Two sherds are classified as Chihuahuan corrugated ware, two are typed as Ramos
Polychrome, and one nonlocal sherd is identified as St. Johns Black-on-red or Polychrome. Nonlocal
ceramics are described in general chronological order, and their likely production areas are reviewed
under Ceramic Source Analyses, below.

Materials Recovered

Chihuahuan Corrugated
Two sherds were identified as Chihuahuan corrugated ware with the assistance of Myles Miller (personal communication, 2000). In the Casas Grandes area these types are associated with the Viejo period,
although their manufacture may have continued into the Medio period (Di Peso et al. 1974b:46, 49).
The end of the Viejo period is currently estimated to be around A.D. 1150-1200 (Dean and Ravesloot
1993:96-98), so these corrugated wares could have come into the region during the Mesilla and/or DoÃ±a
Ana phases (Miller 1995:217).
The two Chihuahuan corrugated sherds were collected during the current investigations from
the surface of two localities (see Table 25). The sherd from SB5 is identified as Convento Corrugated,
indented form (Di Peso et al. 1974b:45-47). Its paste is grayish brown, and it is tempered with sand. It
is a body sherd from a jar, and is 6 mm thick. The exterior surface is corrugated and the interior surface
is burnished/polished. The coils are 8.5 mm wide and are indented at 1.2 mm intervals, although the
sherd is too small to confirm these dimensions. Di Peso et al. (1974b:45-46) speculate that Convento
Corrugated ceramics were used as cooking vessels due to the predominance of soot and cooking grease
on their surfaces.
The Chihuahuan corrugated sherd from SB4 is identified as Convento Pattern Incised Corrugated
(Di Peso et al. 1974b:49-52.). Its paste is light brown, and it is tempered with sand. It is a body sherd
from a jar, and is 4.5 mm thick. The exterior surface is covered with corrugations that were crosscut
by incised diagonal parallel lines while the clay was in a plastic state (Di Peso et al. 1974b:50-51). The
interior surface is polished.
Mimbres Black-on-white
Nine sherds are typed as Mimbres Black-on-white (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:70-79, 88-92),
comprising around 1 percent of the Hueco Tanks ceramic sample. Four were gleaned from the park collection, and the remaining five were recovered during the current investigations from the surface (n = 4)
and a shovel test (n = 1). CA4 and NE2 each yielded 2 Mimbres sherds, and single Mimbres sherds were
collected from five other localities: CA1, CA2, and CA5, and SB4 and SB5 (see Table 25).
Mimbres Black-on-white has been divided into three decorative styles (Anyon and LeBlanc
1984:151-152; Scott 1983:45-67) and additional microstyles (Shafer and Brewington 1995). Eight of the
9 Mimbres sherds from the current investigations were identified to Style II (n = 1), transitional II/III
(n = 2), or III (n = 5) with the assistance of Darrell Creel. The remaining sherd lacks distinctive design
motifs and is classified as Mimbres Black-on-white undifferentiated.
Mimbres Black-on-white ceramics were manufactured between A.D. 750 and 1130 (Scott 1983:41,
45; Shafer and Brewington 1995:7), beginning in the latter part of the Mesilla phase and extending into
the first half of the DoÃ±a Ana phase (Miller 1995:216). Style II is dated from A.D. 880 to 1020, and Style
III/Mimbres Classic was made between A.D. 1010 and 1130 (Anyon et al. 1981; Scott 1983:45; Shafer
and Brewington 1995:7). Style II/III dates between A.D. 970 and 1020 (Shafer and Brewington 1995:17).
In terms of paste color, six of the Mimbres Black-on-white sherds are grayish brown, 2 are gray,
and 1 is brown, conforming to type descriptions (Haury 1936:22; Hawley 1950:62). Seven sherds are
tempered with sand, which is typical of Mimbres ceramics (Haury 1936:22). Exceptions are one sherd
with sand and mica temper and one sherd with sand and crushed rock temper. Runyan and Hedrick

225

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

(1973:35, 1987:44) report that some Mimbres sherds from southeast New Mexico and west Texas have
mica temper.
Body sherds comprise almost all of the Mimbres Black-on-white sample (n = 8), with a single rim
sherd. Vessel wall thickness ranges from 5.4 to 6.4 mm. All nine sherds come from bowls, the predominant vessel form among Mimbres wares (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:76). The single rim sherd represents an orifice diameter of 22 cm. Surface treatment could not be discerned for the interior surfaces
of the sherds due to their painted decoration. Seven of the exterior surfaces are smoothed and one is
floated; the exterior surface of the final sherd is entirely covered with slip so its finish cannot be discerned.
Mimbres Black-on-white decoration is painted onto a backdrop of thick white slip (Cosgrove and
Cosgrove 1932:73; Haury 1936:22). Designs are executed in black paint that is reddened due to overfiring in rare cases (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:72). The Mimbres Style II sherd has typical thin line
hachure framed by thick lines (Figure 57a; Anyon and LeBlanc 1984:152; Scott 1983:50-56; Shafer and
Brewington 1995:13). Designs on the two sherds identified to Mimbres Style II/III (Shafer and Brewington 1995:17) are primarily thick or thin hachure (Figure 57b). The five Mimbres Classic Style III sherds
have fine line hachure bordered by thin lines (Figure 57c); one has nested black squares (Figure 57d)
and is partially slipped on the exterior. The Style III rim sherd has thick double rim bands (Anyon and
LeBlanc 1984:152; Scott 1983:57-59). The remaining sherd has broad lines and triangles of black pigment (reddened from overfiring) that cannot be identified to a particular style.

Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta
Ten sherds were classified as Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta (Hawley 1950:65; Mera and Stallings
1931:2), comprising around 1 percent of the Hueco Tanks ceramic sample. Nine were collected during
the current investigations from the surface of SB6; the remaining sherd is from the park collection and
was assigned to CA5. This type dates between A.D. 1150 and the early 1300s (Breternitz 1966:97; Lehmer
1948:86; Runyan and Hedrick 1973:29; Stewart 1983:45), primarily in the late DoÃ±a Ana phase.
Paste color of these sherds is light brown, conforming to the terracotta hue noted in type
descriptions (e.g., Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:98; Hawley 1950:65; Runyan and Hedrick 1987:38).
Eight sherds have sand temper and the remaining two have crushed rock and sand temper. Sand is
reportedly the predominant temper for these ceramics (Hawley 1950:65; Human Systems Research
1973:335).
Four of the Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta sherds are from rims and the remaining 6 are body
sherds. Nine sherds are from bowls, the prevalent vessel form for this type (Hawley 1950:65; Kelley
1984:140; Mera and Stallings 1931:2). Seven of the nine sherds from SB6 are very similar in paste color
and thickness and appear to be from the same bowl; the two remaining sherds come from the rims of
a bowl with darker paste and a jar. Orifice diameter could only be measured for the bowl represented
by seven sherds, and was estimated to be 15 cm; the other rim sherds were too small to yield accurate
information. Vessel wall thickness ranges from 5.8 to 7.1 mm, within typical parameters (Runyan and
Hedrick 1973:29).
Seven of the Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta sherds have polished interior surfaces; two have
smoothed interior surfaces and the remaining sherd interior is floated. Exterior surface finish on 6 of the
10 sherds is floated, while 2 are smoothed, 1 is polished, and 1 has an eroded surface. Surface treatments
reported for this type range from smoothed to floated to polished (Hawley 1950:65; Human Systems
Research 1973:335; Mera and Stallings 1931:2).
All four of the Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta rim
sherds have a red line painted on the flattened lip, typical of the decoration for this type (Mera and Stallings
1931:2). One bowl rim sherd from SB6 has a diagonal line
extending below the lip (Figure 58a), and a body sherd
from that vessel retains part of a faint red right-angled
line (Figure 58b). The bowl rim sherd from CA5 is decorated with two narrow red lines paralleling the rim (Figure 58c), a motif that is common to this type (Mera and
Stallings 1931:2, Plate I), and also has a hole drilled near
the rim.

test (n = 1). Chupadero sherds comprise 8 percent of the ceramic sample from Hueco Tanks and are
broadly distributed across the park, coming from 21 of the 27 localities with ceramics (see Table 25).
Three localities yielded over one-third of the Chupadero sherds: SB5 (n = 13), CA6 (n = 11), and SB6
(n = 9). Chupadero Black-on-white production began between A.D. 1050 and 1150, and ended in the
late 1500s (Clark 2006:67-68; Kelley 1984:123; Miller 1995:216; Miller and Graves 2009:255-256; Wiseman 1986:4). These long-lived ceramics span the DoÃ±a Ana and El Paso phases, and extend into the
Precontact period.
Paste colors of the Chupadero Black-on-white sherds range from gray (n = 44) to grayish brown
(n = 29) to white (n = 17), similar to those reported by Stallings (1932:72) and Wiseman (1986:9-15).
The sherds are predominantly tempered with sand (n = 62) or crushed rock and sand (n = 25); exceptions are two sherds tempered with sand and grog, and one sherd tempered with crushed rock, sand, and
grog. These tempering materials are typical of Chupadero ceramics (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:96;
Hawley 1950:67; Warren 1981a:179; Wiseman 1986:9-15).
The 80 body sherds comprise most of the Chupadero Black-on-white sample, followed by 6 rim
sherds and 4 handles. Jar sherds make up 91 percent of the sample (n = 81), in contrast to the single
bowl sherd. The narrow-necked spherical jar is the most common Chupadero vessel form (Hayes et al.
1981:70; Wiseman 1986:29). Vessel form could not be determined for four handles, although they are
more often associated with jars than bowls (Hayes et al. 1981:69-70). One handle is made of two ropes
of clay, another is made of three ropes, and the remaining two are lug fragments. Orifice diameter was
estimated for five of the six rim sherds and ranges from 10 to 21 cm, with a mean of 13 cm and a median
of 10 cm. Three of the measurable rim sherds represent narrow-necked jars; the fourth is from a bowlsized (21 cm diameter) vessel but is decorated on the exterior, which is atypical for Chupadero bowls.
Vessel wall thickness ranges from 3.8 to 6.1 mm, somewhat thinner than the 4 to 7 mm thickness range
reported for this type (Hayes et al. 1981:68).
The interior surfaces of 78 of the 90 Chupadero Black-on-white sherds are scored, a surface
treatment that is common on these ceramics (Hawley 1950:67; Stallings 1932:72). Six sherds exhibit
smoothed interiors, and the interior surfaces of six sherds are decorated or too eroded to determine surface treatment. Five sherds have smoothed exteriors, and the surface treatment of the remainder could
not be determined due to decoration or deterioration.
The decorated Chupadero Black-on-white sherds are primarily slipped and painted (n = 76),
with a few that are only slipped (n = 7). The appearance of the slip is typical, consisting of a thin,
streaky wash that ranges from dull pearl gray to white and is often finely crackled (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:96; Hayes et al. 1981:69). Decorations are executed in black mineral paint and consist of
diamonds and triangles composed of broad lines (Figure 59a), hachure, or cross-hatching (Stallings
1932:72-73). Serrate solid and hachured elements are often opposed, meeting at their apexes (Figure
59b; Hayes et al. 1981:70; Mera 1931:3; Runyan and Hedrick 1973:38). One jar sherd has interlocking
curvilinear scrolls (Figure 59c), also reported for this type (Kelley 1984:138-140). Seven undecorated
sherds can be identified as Chupadero Black-on-white by their distinctive paste, temper, and/or surface treatment.
St. Johns Black-on-red or Polychrome
One sherd falls within the White Mountain Redware tradition and may be identified more specifically to the St. Johns Black-on-red or the St. Johns Polychrome type (Carlson 1970; Gladwin and

Gladwin 1931:36-37). The sherd is not small but could come from
either a black-on-red vessel or a polychrome vessel that did not
have white paint on that part of the exterior (Darrell Creel, personal
communication 2004). Manufacture of St. Johns Black-on-red and
St. Johns Polychrome ceramics spans a period from A.D. 1175 to
1300, although St. Johns Black-on-red appears to have been more
common earlier in that period (Carlson 1970:31, 39). This span falls
into the late DoÃ±a Ana phase.
The St. Johns Black-on-red/Polychrome sherd is from the park
collection and has been assigned to SB4. Its paste is gray (GLEY 1
5/N) and heavily tempered with fine sherd fragments, which is common for these ceramics (Carlson 1970:29, 33). This body sherd is
from a bowl and is 4.6 mm thick, falling within the normal range
of 4 to 10 mm (Carlson 1970:29, 33). Interior and exterior surfaces
are covered with a thick red (2.5YR4/8) slip and are highly polished,
as is typical for these wares (Carlson 1970:29). The interior is decorated with black paint in a design of interlocking hachured and solid
stepped frets, separated by an unpainted zigzag band (Figure 60).
Interlocking solid and hachured designs are common on these types
(Carlson 1970:31, 41). The sherd has been modified by a hole drilled
near one end, and one corner is abraded.

Playas Red
Nine sherds are classified as Playas Red (Rinaldo 1974:147-160; Sayles 1936:35-37), comprising
around 1 percent of the Hueco Tanks ceramic sample. Six were recovered during the current investigations from the surface (n = 5) or a shovel test (n = 1), and the remaining three were gleaned from
the park collection. Three of these sherds were collected from SB6, with single sherds from six other
localities (see Table 25). Playas Red ceramics at Casas Grandes are associated with the Buena Fe through
Robles phases (Rinaldo 1974:148), which currently date between A.D. 1200 and the early 1500s (Dean
and Ravesloot 1993:97-98), spanning the late DoÃ±a Ana phase and the El Paso phase (Miller 1995:217).
Paste colors of the Playas Red sherds are reddish brown (n = 5), grayish brown (n = 3), and brown
(n = 1), within the reported range for this type (Hawley 1950:61; Runyan and Hedrick 1973:43). Temper
is primarily sand (n = 6); one sherd is tempered with sand and crushed rock, another with crushed rock
alone, and the final sherd has sand and possibly crushed quartz temper. Sand temper is typical for this
ware (Runyan and Hedrick 1973:43; Wiseman 1981:23).
Seven of the Playas Red specimens are body sherds, one is a near rim sherd, and one is a rim sherd.
All of the sherds are from jars, the predominant vessel form for this type (Rinaldo 1974:150). Orifice
diameter represented by the single rim sherd is 13 cm. Vessel wall thickness generally ranges from 4.9 to
5.5 mm, bracketing the reported range for ceramics of this type (Rinaldo1974:148). The exception is a
sherd that ranges from 7.5 mm to 10.7 mm thick and has a prominent interior bend, which appears to
come from the shoulder of a carinated jar (Rinaldo 1974:150, 158).
The Playas Red sherds exhibit a variety of surface treatments. Interior surfaces of two sherds are
smoothed, two are burnished/polished, one is floated, and the remaining four interior surfaces were too
eroded to identify surface treatment. The interior surface of one body sherd retains evidence of coils that
were not completely obliterated by smoothing. Exterior surfaces of the sherds are primarily burnished/
polished (n = 4); one sherd is smoothed, and the
exterior surfaces of the remainder are obscured
by decoration or erosion.
a

Playas Red ceramics were covered with a
red slip that was highly polished after application (Rinaldo 1974:148-149). These eight sherds
were all slipped, but only vestiges remain within
the punctations of some sherds; vestigial slip
has been noted on other Playas sherds from the
region (Wiseman 1981:25). Slip colors range
from weak red to red (10R 4/3 to 5/6). The rim
sherd and carinated sherd are slipped on both
exterior and interior surfaces, while the other
seven sherds are slipped on the exterior only.

Six Playas Red sherds have additional decoration. Two have incised parallel lines (Figure
61a), and four have diverse styles of punctation:
a line of closely-spaced diagonal indentations
(Figure 61b), a herringbone pattern of long oval
indentations (Figure 61c), a random array of

Materials Recovered

short linear incisions (Figure 61d), and two parallel rows of short oval indentations (Figure 61e). Such
decorations are typical for Playas Red ceramics from the region (Wiseman 1981:25). Decoration on jars
typically is limited to a zone extending from below the rim to the shoulder (Sayles 1936:35).
Ramos Polychrome
Two sherds recovered from the surface of SB6 and WS1 during the current investigations are classified as Ramos Polychrome (Rinaldo and Fenner 1974:250-258; Sayles 1936:49). In the Casas Grandes
area this type is associated with the Buena Fe and Diablo phases (Rinaldo and Fenner 1974:251), which
are currently dated between A.D. 1200 and 1500 (Dean and Ravesloot 1993:97-98), spanning the late
DoÃ±a Ana phase and the El Paso phase (Miller 1995:216).
The paste of these Ramos Polychrome sherds is very pale brown (10YR 8/2) and pink (7.5YR 8/3),
on the darker end of the range of colors reported for this type (Rinaldo and Fenner 1974:251; Runyan
and Hedrick 1973:42). Both are body sherds from jars, and they are from 3.7 to 4.3 mm thick, somewhat
thinner than the reported average vessel wall thickness of 4 to 5 mm (Rinaldo and Fenner 1974:251;
Runyan and Hedrick 1973:42). Both sherds are tempered with fine sand.
Exterior surfaces of the Ramos Polychrome sherds are
self-slipped and polished (Rinaldo and Fenner 1974:251),
and decorated with red and black paint. One sherd has a
weak red (10R 4/4) area bordered by a narrow black line, and
paralleled by another black line (Figure 62a); the other has a
weak red (10R 4/4) triangular area outlined by a narrow black
line (Figure 62b). The red paint on both sherds shows the
wear and chipping that is common to this type (Rinaldo and
Fenner 1974:256-257). Interior surfaces of the sherds are selfslipped and polished. Red solid elements outlined in black
and fine black line work are diagnostic of Ramos Polychrome
(Rinaldo and Fenner 1974:250).

Untyped Ceramics
Eight percent (n = 89) of the ceramics from Hueco Tanks were not identified to type. These sherds
were sorted into three categories: untyped plain (n = 81), untyped textured (n = 6), and untyped painted
(n = 2).
Untyped Plain
A total of 81 undecorated sherds (7 percent of the ceramic sample) were not identified to type.
Almost two-thirds of them (n = 53) come from NW4; the remainder are distributed across 12 localities,
each yielding 8 or fewer specimens (see Table 25). Most of the untyped plain sherds were recovered from
the surface during the current investigations (n = 64), shovel tests yielded another 15 specimens, and 2
sherds were culled from the park collection.

These sherds were distinguished from El Paso Brownware by their finer temper, smoother surface
finish, lighter paste color, and/or greater thinness or thickness. Assigning type designations to nonlocal plain brownware from this area is difficult (Kelley 1984:121-122; Shafer et al. 2001:314; Whalen
1994a:72) and was not attempted. Types that these sherds may be attributed to include Jornada Brown,
which is more finely finished, has thinner walls, and has smaller temper particles than El Paso Brownware (Human Systems Research 1973:329; Jennings 1940:5-6; Mera 1943:12). Alma Plain ceramics
(Haury 1936) also may be found in this area but are primarily distinguished by their geographic concentration in the Mimbres region of southwest New Mexico (Shafer et al. 2001:314).
The untyped plain sherds from Hueco Tanks also were compared to descriptions of historic native
ceramics from the El Paso missions, recently termed Valle Bajo Brownware (Marshall 1997:155, 159). A
collection of native ceramics from Old Socorro Mission (41EP1532) that is curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of The University of Texas also was examined. Due to differences in a number
of attributes, it is unlikely that the Hueco Tanks sample includes historic brownware from the El Paso missions. No evidence of Spanish-influenced forms like platos, copas, or candlesticks was found. Bowls are the
dominant vessel form at the Ysleta, Socorro, and San Elizario missions (Brown et al. 1999:425; Marshall
1999:111; Miller and OâLeary 1992:146), but only one Hueco Tanks untyped plain sherd can be clearly identified as coming from a bowl. Most of the plain ceramics from Ysleta are tempered with mica (Miller and
OâLeary 1992:154), while only 5 of the 81 plain sherds from Hueco Tanks have mica temper. Sooted exteriors and smudged interiors are common on jars from Ysleta (Miller and OâLeary 1992:154-156) and also
are reported from San Elizario (Marshall 1997:179) but are almost absent from the Hueco Tanks sample.
Most of the untyped plain ceramics in the Hueco Tanks sample (n = 53) are from NW4 and appear
to come from the same vessel, although it could not be reconstructed. These body sherds represent a jar,
the surface of which was covered with faint ridges that were incompletely obliterated by subsequent finishing. Similar surface treatments have been documented on Jornada Brown vessels (Jennings 1940:6).
The paste of this Hueco Tanks vessel lot is tempered with sand and fine crushed rock; other attributes of
the sherds exhibit minor variations that can be attributed to manufacture, firing, and/or wear. Exterior
surfaces generally are finely finished: 23 sherds are floated, 15 are burnished/polished, 9 are smoothed,
and 4 are too eroded to determine exterior surface treatment. The interior of the vessel was primarily
smoothed (37 sherds), although 4 sherds are floated, 2 are burnished, and 8 are too eroded to determine
interior surface treatment. Interior and exterior surfaces could not be distinguished on two flat sherds.
Paste color is predominantly reddish brown (n = 33) but ranges into grayish brown (n = 9) and brown
(n = 7), with a few light brown (n = 3) and gray (n = 1) sherds. Vessel wall thickness ranges from 4.5 to
7.1 mm, a greater degree of intra-vessel variation than was observed in the small El Paso Polychrome
bowl from Hueco Tanks (above).
Two untyped plain specimens are rim sherds, both from CA2. One is from a jar with an orifice
diameter of 18 cm. The sherd has a strongly everted lip and is finely finished, with a floated interior
and smoothed exterior. Its brown paste is tempered with sand. Maximum thickness is 8.2 mm. Similar
rim profiles have been reported for Alma Plain (Haury 1936:32-33), Convento Plain (Di Peso et al.
1974b:39-41), and Casas Grandes Plain (Di Peso et al. 1974b:110-111), but the sherd cannot be identified to any of these types with confidence.
The second untyped plain rim sherd from CA2 is from a jar with an inverted lip, but is too small to
yield an orifice diameter. Its grayish brown paste is tempered with sand, and it is smoothed on interior
and exterior surfaces. Maximum thickness is 7.4 mm.
The remaining 26 untyped plain specimens are body sherds, varying in surface treatment, color, and
temper. Exterior and interior surfaces could not be distinguished on 8 flat specimens. On the remaining

232

Materials Recovered

18 sherds, 6 interior surfaces are smoothed, 4 are scraped/scored, 2 are floated, 2 are burnished/polished,
and 4 are too eroded to determine surface treatment. Exterior surface treatments are equally diverse: 7
sherd exteriors are burnished/polished, 5 are floated, 5 are smoothed, and 1 is scraped/scored. The most
common tempering materials are crushed rock and sand (n = 10), followed by sand (n = 7), crushed
rock/sand/mica (n = 4), crushed rock alone (n = 4), and sand and mica (n = 1). Paste colors run the
gamut from grayish brown (n = 8), reddish brown (n = 7), and brown (n = 6), to light brown (n = 3)
and gray (n = 2). Most of these sherds come from jars (n = 12); 1 sherd represents a bowl, and vessel
form could not be determined for 13 sherds. Sherd thickness ranges from 3.1 to 9.0 mm. Two untyped
plain sherds are modified; both have abraded edges.
Untyped Textured
Six localities (see Table 25) yielded corrugated (n = 5) or punctuated/incised (n = 1) sherds that
could not be identified to Mimbres or Chihuahuan textured types, although they have some attributes
of the ceramics from those areas. Four untyped textured sherds were collected from the surface during
the current investigations, and two were gleaned from the park collection. Four are body sherds, one is a
near rim, and one is a rim sherd. All of the sherds come from jars, and have smoothed (n = 4), scraped
(n = 1), or floated (n = 1) interior surfaces. The sherds range from 4.8 to 5.2 mm thick.
The untyped textured body sherd from CA3 has grayish brown paste tempered with sand. Its exterior surface is covered with 5 mm wide corrugations that are indented along vertical alignments. The
decoration bears some resemblance to Convento Vertical Corrugated (Di Peso et al. 1974b:48-49) and
an untyped corrugated ware from the Mimbres area (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:Plate 94f), but the
corrugations on the Hueco Tanks specimen are not as carefully formed or as deeply indented.
The rim sherd from CA5 has grayish brown paste tempered with sand. The lip is slightly everted
and thinned, its curvature representing an orifice diameter of 15 cm. Corrugations begin at the lip; they
range from 1 to 7 mm wide and are indented and flattened. The sherd appears to come from a bowl, and
its interior surface is smudged. Mimbres Partially and Fully Corrugated vessels have similar narrow flattened corrugations, but retain an untextured band below the lip (McCollum 1992:94, 98). Convento and
Casa Grandes Corrugated vessels have corrugations that begin at the rim, but their lips are thickened
and flared (Di Peso et al. 1974b:31, 46, 129).
The untyped textured sherd in the park collection from CA6 has light brown paste tempered with
sand; curvature indicates that it comes from the neck of a jar. The exterior has 4 to 5 mm wide corrugations
that are flattened and indented at irregular intervals. Three Circle Neck Corrugated vessels have corrugations of this width, but they are not flattened or indented (Haury 1936:36; McCollum 1992:73, 76).
The untyped textured body sherd in the park collection from CA7 is made of gray paste tempered
with sand. Flattened corrugations on its exterior surface are ca. 4 mm wide. It resembles the corrugated
gray utility wares of northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado, but cannot be associated
with that area confidently (James Neely, personal communication 2006).
The untyped textured body sherd from NW2 has grayish brown paste tempered with sand and mica.
It has a 3 cm wide diagonal band of very narrow (2 mm wide) corrugations that have been completely
obliterated by smoothing at the edges of the band. This decoration has the appearance of appliquÃ©, but
sherd edges show that the corrugations originate from coils. The sherd is relatively large (6 by 4.5 cm),
flat, and apparently comes from a large vessel. It resembles corrugated wares from west-central New
Mexico that date to the Tularosa phase (A.D. 1150 to 1300; James Neely, personal communication 2006).

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

The untyped textured body sherd from WS1 has grayish brown paste tempered with sand. The
exterior is marked by scattered oval punctations ranging from 2 to 4 mm in maximum dimension. A
small group of parallel incised lines spaced at 1 mm intervals adjoins the punctations near one edge of the
sherd. Punctations and incised lines are reported for ceramics from the Mimbres region (Cosgrove and
Cosgrove 1932:Plate 95; Haury 1936:39, Plate IV) and Chihuahua (Di Peso et al. 1974b:53-54, 140-142),
but illustrated examples do not resemble the decoration on this sherd. Although it could be an aberrant
example of Playas Red ceramics from the region (Wiseman 1981:25), it lacks any trace of red slip.
Untyped Painted
Two painted sherds that do not correlate with known types were gleaned from the park collection. A
sherd from CA7 has brown paste tempered with crushed rock and sand, somewhat finer than the temper usually found in El Paso Brownware. This body sherd appears to be from a jar. Both surfaces of the
sherd are highly polished, and the exterior is covered with black paint. The sherd is 6.2 mm thick. The
exterior resembles Ramos Black, but the unblackened paste is not common in that type (Di Peso et al.
1974b:160-161). It may be an El Paso Polychrome sherd with atypical surface finishes.
The second untyped painted specimen is a rim sherd from NE1. Its paste is light brownish gray and
is tempered with crushed rock and sand. The exterior surface is polished and covered with red slip at
the rim. The interior surface is smoothed but has been eroded and scratched; it is covered with red slip
and has a barely visible band of black lines 1 cm below the lip. The interior decoration indicates that
this sherd comes from a bowl, and its estimated orifice diameter is 18 cm. The sherd is 7.3 mm thick.
The decoration resembles Lincoln Black-on-red band designs in that it consists of lobed lines bracketed by horizontal layout lines (Stewart 1979:309, 312-315). Red polished slips are known to have been
applied to some Lincoln Black-on-red bowl interiors (Kelley 1984:143). The sherd lacks the black lip
band that is characteristic of this type, however (Hawley 1950:66; Mera and Stallings 1931:7), and the
12 mm distance of the decorative band below the rim is atypically wide (cf. Mera and Stallings 1931:8;
Stewart 1979).
Modified Ceramic Sherds
Thirteen sherds (1 percent of the sample) have been modified. Nine localities yielded modified
ceramics, most coming from CA5 (n = 3), NE1 (n = 2), and SB6 (n = 2). Single modified sherds were
found at six other localities: CA1, CA2, NE2, NW2, SB3, and SB4. Undifferentiated El Paso Brownware
(n = 4) and El Paso Polychrome (n = 4) are the most common types represented, followed by untyped
plain (n = 2), and single sherds of El Paso Brown, Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta, and St. Johns Blackon-red/Polychrome. Nine modified sherds were recovered during the current investigations from the
surface (n = 8) and a shovel test (n = 1), and four were gleaned from the park collection. Six modified
sherds have abraded edges, four have drilled holes, and three are drilled disks.
The three perforated disks are made from undifferentiated El Paso Brownware sherds. Such artifacts
are speculated to have served as spindle whorls or flywheels (Lehmer 1948:28). They are distributed
across the American Southwest and northern Chihuahua, and have been recovered from Mesilla and El
Paso phase sites in the Jornada Mogollon area (Lehmer 1948:28, 48, 61). Some specimens from caves
have been found on spindles, while others have thongs threaded through them (Di Peso et al. 1974b:332333). The holes typically were drilled from both surfaces of the sherd, resulting in an hourglass-shaped
234

Materials Recovered

perforation. The broken edges of the sherd were left unaltered or abraded into a circular shape (Di Peso
et al. 1974b:332-333, 343-345; Lehmer 1948:28-29).
Two of the perforated disks from Hueco Tanks are complete and one is a fragment. One complete
disk is roughly square (Figure 63a), its diameter ranging from 34 to 37 mm. Most of the margin consists
of broken edges that have not been abraded. Its 4 mm diameter hole was drilled primarily from the interior surface of the sherd. The second complete disk is 42 mm in diameter and almost all of its margin
has been abraded. Its perforation is slightly off-center (Figure 63b), was drilled from both surfaces, and
is 3 mm in diameter. The fragment from CA5 comprises around one-fourth of a disk, with a radius of
ca. 20 mm; if complete, its size would have been equivalent to the other two disks. It has a minimally
abraded margin and retains part of the central perforation, which was drilled primarily from the interior sherd surface.
Four sherds have drilled holes
but are not disk-shaped. Three are
rim sherds with single holes near
the lip that may represent crack
mending (Shafer et al. 2001:322;
Smiley 1977:200), but also could
have been used for suspension. On
a Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta
bowl sherd from CA5, the 3 mm

diameter hole is 9 mm below the

lip, was drilled from the decorated

interior surface, and is broken (see

Figure 58c). An El Paso Polychrome
bowl sherd from SB6 retains part Figure 63. Perforated ceramic disks. (a) NW1; (b) SB3.
of a hole that was drilled from the
interior, located 11 mm below the lip. From NW2, an El Paso Polychrome Transitional jar rim has a 2
mm diameter hole positioned 30 mm below the lip and drilled from the exterior (see Figure 55c).
The fourth sherd with a drilled hole is a body sherd from a St. Johns Black-on-red or Polychrome
bowl, recovered from SB4 (see Figure 60). The hole measures 3 mm in diameter and was drilled from the
exterior, undecorated side. One corner of the trapezoid-shaped sherd is lightly abraded. The shape and
decoration of the sherd appear ornamental, and similar specimens have been considered to be pendants
(Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:65; Di Peso et al. 1974b:355-356; Sale 2003:129).
Six sherds have been modified by abrasion alone; the modified edges are even and smooth, and do
not exhibit the uneven wear and striations on sherds thought to be digging tools (Miller 1989:190). Two
of the Hueco Tanks specimens are rim sherds with single abraded edges. CA2 yielded a rim sherd from
an El Paso Brown jar with a pointed lower edge that is thinned as if worn from use. An El Paso Polychrome jar rim sherd from NE1 (see Figure 55e) has a sharply beveled facet on the exterior of the lip,
with an edge angle of 55 degrees. Sherds with beveled edges from the Los Tules and Bradfield sites have
been characterized as scrapers (Lehmer 1948:31, 49-50, 62; cf. Shafer et al. 2001:325-326).
Multiple abraded edges were found on two rectangular sherds that resemble specimens that have
been called pottery smoothing tools (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:88; Di Peso et al. 1974b:335; 341-343;
Shafer et al. 2001:325; Smiley 1977:201-204). An untyped plain body sherd from CA1 is abraded on all
four edges. An El Paso Polychrome rim sherd from SB6 has an abraded edge opposite the lip, and one
of its lateral edges is also abraded.

235

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Two small body sherds have abraded, curved edges; they may be disk fragments but cannot be
identified with confidence due to their size. One is an undifferentiated El Paso Brownware sherd from
CA5, and the other is an untyped plain sherd from NE2.
Ceramic Source Analyses
When the ceramics in the Jornada Mogollon area and adjoining regions were first identified to type,
they were assumed to have been made in the areas where they were most abundant. Since that time,
ceramic source analyses have provided increasingly refined definitions of loci of production for El Paso
Brownware, Mimbres Black-on-white, Chupadero Black-on-white, and Playas Red ware. For three other
types in the Hueco Tanks sampleâThree Rivers Red-on-terracotta, St. Johns Black-on-red/Polychrome,
and Ramos Polychromeâinitial assumptions about their areas of production have not been tested.
Ceramic source identification in the Jornada Mogollon area initially relied on petrography and
other analytical methods, but instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) has come into increasing use due to its accurate measurement of multiple trace elements. The origins of the Hueco Tanks Village ceramics were first studied through petrographic analyses (Carricker 1982; Rogers 1982), and also
were part of the earliest INAA on ceramics in the region (Ekland 1977). Since 1996, more precise data
on the origins of ceramics at Hueco Tanks have been obtained through INAA of the concentrations of
33 trace elements (Appendix A) in 48 sherds and 1 crushed syenite sample (Table 28).
Twenty-four of the 48 specimens in the Hueco Tanks INAA sample were recovered during the current investigations, consisting of 20 El Paso Brownware and 4 Playas Red sherds. All were collected from
the surface except one El Paso Polychrome sherd from a shovel test in CA7. The syenite sample was collected from the arroyo between North and East Mountains, and was analyzed because it resembles the
temper in El Paso Brownware. The 23 sherds and crushed rock sample represent all areas of the park
except the East Strip localities, which yielded few sherds. The Research Reactor Center of the University
of Missouri-Columbia (MURR) conducted the INAA according to standard sample preparation, irradiation, and data reduction procedures (Descantes 2003), as part of a larger INAA survey of southwestern
ceramics by Darrell Creel of the University of Texas at Austin.

Materials Recovered

The sample from the current investigations is augmented by INAA data on 24 sherds from previous investigations at Hueco Tanks (see Prehistoric Background section). Twenty-one of them are from
Hueco Tanks Village (16 Mimbres Black-on-white and 5 El Paso Brownware sherds) and were submitted for analysis by Myles Miller in 1996. Three Chupadero Black-on-white sherds curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory were submitted for analysis by Darrell Creel in 1999 (Clark 2006;
Creel, Clark, and Neff 2002). Two of them had been collected by E. B. Sayles during a visit to the Tanks
(Sayles 1932) and cannot be identified to locality; the third was collected by John Greer in 1963 from
CA2, CA5, or CA6 (see Prehistoric Background section).
El Paso Brownware ceramics comprise almost half of the INAA sample from Hueco Tanks,
consisting of 4 Brown rim sherds, 2 Bichrome sherds, and 19 Polychrome sherds from 13 localities.
El Paso Polychrome was the first of these types to be defined, and was thought to be focused âin the
vicinity of El Paso, Texas, where its collective abundance is more than twice that of any other decorated
wareâ (Stallings 1931:2). As Brown and Bichrome types were distinguished within this ware, it became
generally accepted that âthe Hueco Bolson (along with the adjacent Tularosa and Mesilla Bolsons of
south central New Mexico) in the vicinity of El Paso can be considered the geographic âheartlandâ of El
Paso Brownware productionâ (Miller 1995:210).
Efforts to distinguish El Paso Brownware manufacturing loci within this broad area through INAA
have met with mixed results. The array of elements in the clays suggests that they derived from igneous
sources (Dulaney and Piggott 1977:269, 285; Myles Miller personal communication 2006), but those
clays have not been identified. Preliminary chemical analysis (Bentley 1992a:393-394; 1995) suggested
that clay from igneous rock comprising Cerro Alto was used to make ceramics at Hot Well pueblo
(41EP5), but this has not been substantiated. After a compositional signature for brownware was defined
(Lowry and Bentley 1997:98), three groups were discerned among sherds from the western Hueco Bolson, but minimal differences between them suggested that they represent similar clays obtained from
different topographic situations, and/or tempered with diverse materials (Miller et al. 1997; Shafer et al.
1998, 2001:348). The vast majority of El Paso Polychrome and Bichrome sherds in a sample from the
western Hueco Bolson and Mimbres area were then classified to a single El Paso group (Creel, Williams,
Neff, and Glascock 2002:43-44). Recently, Miller conducted a statistical analysis of INAA data on 514 El
Paso Brownware sherds, and identified several groups that are robust in terms of statistical probability
and geographic identity, along with others that are not as secure (Miller 2007:12-14 through 12-20;
Miller and Burt 2007:5-11 through 5-16).
In Millerâs classification, the 25 El Paso Brownware sherds from Hueco Tanks are identified to four
groups (Table 29), three of which are linked to sites on or near the Hueco Bolson. One Bichrome sherd
and seven Polychrome sherds are in Hueco East 1, one of two production groups identified at several
sites (including Hueco Tanks) along the eastern margin of the Hueco Bolson (Miller 2007:12-18). Eight
other sherds are in Hueco West Fan, a major production group identified at several sites along the
western margins of the Hueco Bolson and southern Tularosa Basin, including the Franklin and Organ
Mountain alluvial fans. Extensive igneous outcrops in these ranges have the closest chemical signature
to this group. Two sherds are in Hueco West Basin 1, one of several compositional groups distributed
among numerous sites in the western Hueco Bolson, most located in the basin and adjacent to playas.
Seven sherds are assigned to North, a poorly defined group that probably contains multiple production
areas, and includes sites located on the Rio Grande valley, in the San Andres Mountains, on the Jornada del Muerto, and in the Jarilla Mountains (Miller 2007:12-18; Miller and Burt 2007:5-14). El Paso
Brown is the only type that is limited to a single compositional group, while the El Paso Polychrome
sherds fall into all four groups. The syenite sample is not assigned to any compositional group, nor have
other crushed rock samples that have been submitted for INAA (Myles Miller, personal communication

2006), possibly because INAA signatures primarily represent the clay paste (Regge Wiseman, personal
communication 2009).
Mimbres Black-on-white ceramics were first found in high concentrations on the upper Mimbres
River drainage in southwestern New Mexico (Haury 1936:26). Lehmer (1948:71) noted additional sites
dominated by Mimbres ceramics along and east of the Rio Grande between Hatch and Caballo. By the
1970s the heartland of Mimbres ceramic manufacture was thought to center on the Mimbres River
and its tributaries, bounded on the north by the Pinos Altos range, on the east by the Mimbres Mountains, and on the west by the Burro Mountains (Human Systems Research 1973:345-346). Carmichael
(1986a:68-69) then proposed that Mimbres ceramics could have been produced across a broad area that
included the Tularosa Basin. Petrographic studies found Mimbres temper to be diverse, leading Rugge
(1988:189) to conclude that some vessels might have been produced outside the heartland. INAA subsequently indicated that Mimbres ceramics were produced from clay obtained in the Mimbres and upper
Gila River valleys, and identified multiple compositional groups (Brewington and Shafer 1999:193-194;
Brewington et al. 1997:127; Gilman et al. 1994:701-704), although they could not be associated with
particular sites (Miller et al. 1997).
Recent INAA on Mimbres ceramics (Speakman 2008) confirms that the 16 Mimbres Black-onwhite sherds from Hueco Tanks Village were made in southwestern New Mexico (Table 30). Five sherds
in Group 23 and three in Group 1 apparently originated along the Rio Grande valley, from Las Cruces to
north of Hatch. Three sherds in Group 2B, two in Group 4, and two in Group 11 come from the middle
to upper Mimbres River valley, and the single unassigned sherd is broadly affiliated with the Mimbres
area. The multiple compositional groups represented in the 12 Mimbres Style III sherds from Hueco
Tanks Village indicate that during the relatively brief period of their production in the early DoÃ±a Ana
phase (A.D. 1010 to 1130; see above), a widespread trade network brought ceramics from most of the
Mimbres cultural area to Hueco Tanks.
The center of production for Chupadero Black-on-white ceramics was first thought to be in
southern Torrance and eastern Socorro Counties, New Mexico (Mera 1931:1). Intensive study in the
1970s revealed that the âhearth areaâ apparently was confined to Chupadera Mesa, the adjacent northern Tularosa Basin, the upper Jornada del Muerto, and probably along the Rio Grande between Belen
and Socorro (Hayes et al. 1981:68; Warren 1981b:70; Wiseman 1986:4). Southeast of that area, Kelley
(1979:128-129, 1984:123) found evidence of local manufacture in the Sierra Blanca region of central
New Mexico. Through INAA of numerous sherds from a broad region, the Salinas and Sierra Blanca
areas have been confirmed as primary production loci for Chupadero Black-on-white (Clark 2006:133;

Two of the three Chupadero Black-on-white sherds from Hueco Tanks initially were identified to the
Chupadero 1b compositional subgroup, which is associated with the Sierra Blanca region near Capitan
Mountain (Creel, Clark, and Neff 2002:114, 120). More-detailed analyses reassigned these two sherds to
Chupadero 1b and 1c (Clark 2006:418), closely related compositional subgroups that derive from the
upper Rio Bonito drainage in the Sierra Blanca region (Clark 2006:137, 154-156). The third sherd was
classified as Chupadero unassigned in both studies (Clark 2006:419; Creel, Clark, and Neff 2002:114).
Hence, the Chupadero Black-on-white ceramics at Hueco Tanks originated in south-central New Mexico.
Playas Red ceramics initially were thought to have been produced in northern Mexico based on their
concentration in the Casas Grandes drainage and Santa Maria valley to the southeast (Sayles 1936:36).
Intensive investigations in that area led Di Peso to assert that the center of production was the Casas
Grandes valley (Di Peso et al. 1974b:148). These ceramics are distributed across a broad area, including
southern Chihuahua in Mexico, southern New Mexico, southeastern Arizona, and west Texas (Bradley
and Hoffer 1985:161, 167). Production of Playas in the Sierra Blanca area of New Mexico was proposed by Wiseman (1981) based on the resemblance of temper particles to local rocks; a similar claim
was made by McCluney (Skibo et al. 2002:42) for southwestern New Mexico. Geographic variability in
the composition of Playas Red ceramics has been demonstrated via X-ray fluorescence (Bradley and
Hoffer 1985:171-175). Recent INAA produced evidence of manufacturing locales in the Mimbres and
upper Gila areas, and widespread manufacture and movement of Playas vessels throughout the southern Southwest (Creel 1999:115-116; Creel, Williams, Neff, and Glascock 2002:43). Local manufacture
also may be indicated in samples from the western Hueco Bolson (Shafer et al. 2001:343, 351).
From Hueco Tanks, four of the nine Playas Red sherds in the ceramic sample were submitted for
INAA. In the chem05 compositional groups identified by MURR Senior Research Specialist Jeff Speakman, three of the Playas sherds (from CA5, SB4, and SB6) are identified to the Playas Red compositional
group, and presumably are from Mexico. Another Playas Red sherd from SB6 is identified to the Mimbres 72 compositional group, and apparently was made in the Mimbres region.
The origins of other nonlocal ceramics at Hueco Tanks have not been confirmed through compositional analyses but are reasonably well known. Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta initially was believed
to come from in and around Three Rivers, New Mexico (Mera and Stallings 1931:1). Subsequent work
affirmed that its greatest abundance and likely production area was in the highlands and drainages of
much of the Sierra Blanca region (Stewart 1983:45, 60). This type is widely distributed, and has been found
on many Mimbres sites; one vessel was traded as far south as Casas Grandes (Di Peso et al. 1974a:251).
St. Johns Black-on-red/Polychrome was first thought to be focused within 50 miles of St. Johns in
the Little Colorado River drainage (Gladwin and Gladwin 1931:37). Later studies found the highest

239

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

frequencies in west-central New Mexico from the continental divide to the Arizona-New Mexico border,
where it apparently was manufactured (Carlson 1970:37-39). St. Johns Polychrome is a widely distributed
pottery type, and has been found from Mesa Verde to Casas Grandes (Gladwin and Gladwin 1931:37).
Ramos Polychrome ceramics are concentrated in the Casas Grandes valley (Di Peso et al. 1974b:251;
Sayles 1936:53-54), which remains the most likely production locale, although evidence of secondary
production in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico recently has come to light (Fish and
Fish 1999:39; Skibo et al. 2002:39-41). Ramos Polychrome is one of the most broadly traded types from
northern Mexico. Chihuahuan corrugated types Convento Corrugated and Convento Pattern Incised
Corrugated also were produced in the Casas Grandes valley and somewhat farther west, but were not
distributed as widely (Di Peso et al. 1974b:46, 50).

CHIPPED STONE
A total of 2,304 chipped stone artifacts were recovered during the current investigations at Hueco
Tanks State Park and Historic Site, consisting of 34 projectile points, 47 other tools, 8 cores, and 2,215
pieces of debitage (Table 31). This sample was obtained in part through collection of projectile points,
obsidian artifacts, and artifacts made of nonlocal stone that were observed on the surface. The sample
also includes chipped stone artifacts from 33 shovel tests and 7 dog leash surface collection areas. The
sample from the current investigations is augmented by 114 projectile points from the park collection
(see Methods of Archeological Investigations section), which comprise the majority (77 percent) of the
projectile point sample. The combined samples total 2,418 chipped stone artifacts from 28 localities;
none were collected from NE3.
Research Strategy and Analytical Methods
The analysis of chipped stone attributes was designed to accomplish two objectives. The age of
projectile points was estimated through evaluation of their time-diagnostic attributes. The degree of
mobility and interaction of the prehistoric residents of Hueco Tanks was addressed through identification of the origins of lithic materials.
Projectile points and fragments were measured as possible for length, haft length, blade width, stem
width, base width, base depth, and thickness. Blade and stem treatments of grinding, beveling, and/or
serration were noted. Projectile points were divided into dart and arrow points on the basis of size and
stem width; the dart points generally have a minimum stem width greater than 8 mm and a maximum
thickness exceeding 4 mm. Other tools and tool fragments were classified morphologically as bifaces or
unifaces, with one exceptionâa drill fragment; otherwise, function was not assigned because edge wear
analysis was not conducted. Attributes of cores that were recorded are maximum dimension, number
of flake scars, and amount of cortex. The debitage was examined using a 10X hand lens, and attributes
recorded were completeness, amount of dorsal cortex, and presence/absence of platform cortex. Complete flake sizes were measured with a diagram of concentric circles at 1 cm intervals. Debitage that
appeared to be utilized or modified was noted and bagged separately during analysis, but is not enumerated in the report.
Raw material was noted for all stone artifacts, but identification was hampered by minimal comparative samples. Previous archeological studies in the Hueco Bolson and adjacent areas have discussed the

wide variety of archeologically significant stone sources in the region. Church (1996:23) notes thatâ
with the exception of several obsidian source analysesâidentifications of lithic materials in most studies are based on visual criteria that are ambiguous and of little use for evaluation of lithic procurement.
This difficulty is evident in the number of lithic material categories defined by archeologists in particular samples, ranging from 5 (Camilli 1988) to 210 (Carmichael 1985a:200-206); the latter includes 141
varieties of chert, 11 varieties of jasper, 31 varieties of chalcedony, and 8 varieties of rhyolite, discerned
through differences in color, texture, inclusions, and fracture quality.
Five lithic material categories were defined in the Hueco Tanks sample, based on visual analysis and
comparison with a collection of raw materials from the Jornada Mogollon area loaned by Tim Church:

241

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

chert, quartzite, obsidian, Rancheria chert, and unidentified. Chert is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of microcrystalline quartz, including flint, chalcedony, agate, jasper, hornstone, novaculite, and
several varieties of semiprecious gems (Luedtke 1992:5). In the Hueco Tanks sample, chert colors are
primarily gray and brown, but range from white to black; in the southern Jornada Mogollon region the
dominant colors are gray, brown, and black (Church et al. 1996:65). Quartzites used for chipped stone
artifacts are sandstones that have been cemented by silica (Church et al. 1996:76, 109). Depending on
the degree of alteration, quartzites can range from macrocrystalline to microcrystalline; common colors include red, yellow, white, and brown. For the purpose of this study, quartzite includes medium- to
coarse-grained materials that are described elsewhere as orthoquartzite, quartzitic sandstone, siliceous
sandstone, silicified sandstone, and quartz-rich sandstone (Banks 1990:155; Church et al. 1996:76-77,
108-110; Collins and Raney 2000:20; Whalen 1994a:96, 113). Obsidian is a glassy volcanic rock composed of pure silica; it is very fine grained, and translucent gray or black (Church et al. 1996:86). Rancheria is a distinctive variety of chert that is dark gray to black and almost totally devoid of bioclasts
(Church et al. 1996:65; Myles Miller, personal communication, 2003). Unidentified materials include a
wide range of colors and grain sizes, and could not be placed in one of the preceding categories.
Projectile Points
A total of 148 projectile points were analyzed, consisting of 114 specimens from the park collection
(77 percent) and 34 specimens recovered during the current investigations (23 percent). Dart points
outnumber arrow points by almost 6 to 1; they represent 5 percent and 1 percent of the chipped stone
artifacts, respectively. Of the 126 dart points, 99 (79 percent) are from the park collection and 27 (21
percent) were recovered during the current investigations. Of the 22 arrow points, 15 (68 percent) are
from the park collection and 7 (32 percent) were recovered during the current investigations. Almost all
of the projectile points were collected from the surface, except for 5 dart points and 4 arrow points from
shovel tests. Metric attributes and materials of the projectile points are given in Table 32; unidentifiable
fragments are not included.
Several attributes are particularly important in determining projectile point chronology in far west
Texas (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:232-235; Roney 1985b). The primary attribute is stem form, which
changed through time âfrom strong-stemmed or split-stem Early Archaic forms, to contracting stem
and concave base forms as well as expanding stem forms of the Middle Archaic, to side-notched, convex,
or flat-based Late Archaic varietiesâ (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:232). Projectile point size is also generally time-diagnostic because projectile point length generally decreased over time (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:232-233). Stem widths of 8 mm or less are characteristic of most Formative period arrow points
(Roney 1985a:105, 151).
Stem morphology is the primary classification criterion used for the Hueco Tanks projectile point
sample. The dart points initially were sorted into morphological groups based on stem forms: lanceolate; parallel or contracting stem; expanding stem and concave base; corner-notched expanding
stem and straight to convex base; and side-notched expanding stem and straight base. They were then
assigned to time spans based on the chronology by Miller and Kenmotsu (2004:232-235). Arrow points
were sorted from dart points on the basis of size and stem width.
Two lanceolate dart points come from the park collection; both are made of chert. One is fluted
on both sides, with the flutes extending most of the length of the blade (Figure 64a). This specimen is
typed as a Folsom dart point (Turner and Hester 1999:120) and dates to the early Paleoindian period,
between 9000 and 8200 B.C. (Haynes et al. 1992:96; Miller 2006:13, 15). The other point (Figure 64b)

has oblique parallel flake scars, a well-defined medial ridge, and a concave base that has been thinned
by small vertical flake removals. The base and lower third of the blade edges are ground. This specimen
is untyped but dates to the late Paleoindian period, between 8200 and 6000 B.C. (Carmichael 1986a:8;
Miller 2006:13, 15).

Figure 64

Five contracting and parallel-stemmed dart points were
recovered (Figure 65): one from the surface during the current
investigations and four from the park collection (see Table 32).
All of the specimens are chert. Two have contracting stems (Figure 65a, b), three have parallel stems (Figure 65c, d, e), and the
extant blade of one is serrated on one edge (Figure 65c). These
dart points appear to date to the Early Archaic period, between
6000 and 4000/3000 B.C. (Miller 2007:3-1).
Eleven dart points with expanding stems and concave bases
were recovered (Figure 66a-k): 1 from the surface during the current investigations and 10 from the park collection (see Table 32).
Seven are corner-notched (Figure 66b, c, e, f, g, i, j, k), and two
are side-notched (Figure 66f, h). Three have prominent ears or
basal corners (Figure 66f, h, k). One has a proximal blade fragment that is serrated (Figure 66d). Seven are made of chert, and
one each of quartzite, obsidian, Rancheria chert, and an unidentified material. These dart points appear to date to the Middle

(see Table 32). Only one is complete (Figure 67q). Most of the points have weak to strong shoulders
except for three with small barbs (Figure 67n, u, v). Ten are made of chert, two of Rancheria chert, one
of quartzite, and one of an unidentified material. These dart points appear to date to the Late Archaic

Sixteen dart points and dart point proximal fragments do not conform to any of the preceding categories,
and are classified as unidentified (Figure 69). Two were recovered during the current investigations (1
surface, 1 shovel test), and 14 are from the park collection (see Table 32). Seven are unstemmed with
straight to convex bases (Figure 69a-g), four have contracting stems (Figure 69h-k), three have expanding
stems (Figure 69l-n), one has a parallel stem (Figure 69o), and one is indeterminate (Figure 69p). One
obsidian point has a prominent barb (Figure 69p), two points have serrated blades (Figure 69l, o), and one
has a notched blade (Figure 69g). Eleven are made of chert, three of obsidian, and two of quartzite. These
dart points date generally to the Archaic period, between 6000 B.C. and A.D. 200 (Miller 2007:3-1).
Thirty-seven medial and distal dart point fragments are categorized as unidentifiable, because they
lack features that would allow their placement into morphological groups. Seven were recovered from
NE1; five from CA7, four from CA5; three each from CA1, CA3, and CA6; two each from CA2 and
NW1; and one each from ES1, ES2, NE2, NE4, NW2, SB3, WS2, and WS3. Most (25) are from the

shovel tests. Four have serrated blades and one has a beveled blade. Twenty-five are made of chert,
six of quartzite, three of obsidian, one of Rancheria chert, and two of an unidentified material. These
dart point fragments date generally to the Archaic period, between 6000 B.C. and A.D. 200 (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:222, 232-235).
Twenty-two arrow points were recovered: 7 during the current investigations (3 from the surface,
4 from shovel tests), and 15 from the park collection (see Table 32). Four have concave bases (Figure
70a-d); two have convex bases (Figure 70e, f), and two have indeterminate bases (Figure 70g, h). Three
are corner-notched (Figure 70i-k) and seven are side-notched (Figure 70l-r). Five have beveled blades
(Figure 70d, e, f, h, o), and one has a serrated blade (from NE2, see Table 32). Seventeen are made of
chert, three of obsidian, and two of quartzite. Arrow points date to the Formative period, between A.D.
850 and 1450 (Roney 1985b:29; Whalen 1994a:109), and may have persisted into the Precontact and
Protohistoric periods (Miller 2001:126-129; Phelps 1987).
Projectile point size, stem width, and blade beveling/serration of projectile points in far west Texas
appear to vary through time, based on a sample of 1,233 points from Fort Bliss (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004:232-233). After the dart points from the Hueco Tanks sample were sorted into morphological
groups based on stem form, averages of the length and stem width were calculated, and the frequency of
blade beveling and/or serration was noted (see Table 32).

For the sample of measurable dart points, length generally decreases through time, from 42 to 32
mm, while the 10 measurable arrow points average 21 mm in length (see Table 32). This sample reflects
the pattern predicted by Miller and Kenmotsu (2004:232-233).
Stem width also generally decreases through time for the sample of measurable dart points, from
almost 14 mm to 11 mm, while the 11 measurable arrow points average about 7 mm in stem width
(see Table 32). This sample reflects the pattern found by Miller and Kenmotsu (2004:233) and Roney
(1985a:105, 151).
Serration and beveling were more common on Middle Archaic dart points in a large sample from
Fort Bliss (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:233). Seven dart points in the Hueco Tanks sample have serrated
blades, but only four have stem forms that allow placement in morphological groups (see Table 32).
Three of the four do not date to the Middle Archaic, nor does the single dart point with a beveled blade.
Therefore, the small sample from Hueco Tanks does not follow the pattern found in the large sample
from Fort Bliss (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:233).
Other Tools
Forty-seven non-projectile tools and tool fragments were recovered from 23 localities during the
current investigations, consisting of 36 bifaces, 10 unifaces, and 1 drill fragment (see Table 31). Thirtyone were recovered from shovel tests. The 16 tools collected from the surface include 3 obsidian bifaces,
2 items from dog leash samples, and 1 from the surface collection of NW4. Ten other tools were collected from the surface because they initially appeared to be potential time-diagnostic projectile point
fragments or made of nonlocal material.
The 36 bifaces are made of a variety of materials; 21 are chert, 9 are quartzite, 3 are obsidian, 2 are
Rancheria chert, and 1 is made of an unidentified material. The largest biface is a quartzite core/chopper
from NW4 that measures 71 by 61 by 42 mm; the proximal end retains cortex (Figure 71c). Two complete triangular quartzite bifaces were recovered: one from SB6 has a concave base and is 69 by 46 x 11
mm (Figure 71a); the other from SB3 has a straight base and is 64 by 34 by 13 mm (Figure 71b). Most of
the other bifaces are fragments measuring less than 40 mm in maximum dimension.
Eight of the unifaces are chert and two are quartzite. Both of the quartzite unifaces (Figure 72) are
large secondary flakes that were recovered from SB6: one measures 100 by 76 by 28 mm, and the other is
80 by 53 by 14 mm. They resemble the broad, flat tools found on prehistoric agave fields and near agave
roasting pits across the American Southwest, and apparently were used to sever agave leaves from the
hearts (Fish et al. 1992; Hines et al. 1994:56-60, 139). The chert unifaces were made on flake fragments
or angular debris. All of the unifaces have minimal flake removals and appear to be expedient tools.
The distal fragment of a quartzite drill was recovered from a shovel test in WS2.
Cores
Eight cores were recovered from seven shovel tests in seven localities (see Table 31). Maximum
dimensions range from 30 to 50 mm, and the number of flake scars vary from two to eight. Five of the
cores are chert and three are quartzite. Four of the chert cores have 25 percent cortex or less, and one has
75 percent. Two of the quartzite cores are decorticate, and one retains 50 percent cortex.

Debitage
A total of 2,215 pieces of debitage were recovered during the current investigations; 1,888 specimens
(85 percent) are from shovel tests and 327 (15 percent) are from surface collections (primarily dog leash
samples). The largest debitage sample comes from NE1 (n = 396), followed by 235 pieces from CA3. Six
other localities yielded 100 to 150 specimens, 7 localities produced 50 to 99 pieces of debitage, and 13
localities have less than 50 specimens each (see Table 31). Chert comprises over half of the debitage (n =
1,293, 54 percent), and quartzite makes up almost one-third of the sample (n = 706, 30 percent). Obsidian, Rancheria chert, and unidentified materials each constitute four percent or less of the debitage.
Four completeness categories were distinguished in the debitage: complete flakes, proximal fragments, medial/distal fragments, and angular debris (Table 33). Complete flakes retain a striking platform and a feathered or hinged termination. Proximal fragments retain a platform but lack feathered
or hinged distal margins. Medial and distal fragments do not retain a platform, and angular debris lacks
clear flake features.

*Excludes angular debris.

In comparison to the other raw materials, obsidian is differentially distributed in terms of debitage
completeness. The percentage of complete obsidian flakes is almost twice as high as that of other materials, while the percentage of obsidian medial/distal fragments is substantially lower. Chert is over-represented in the angular debris category. These variations may be due to differential breakage properties of
those materials: the small obsidian gravels may be less likely to fracture into smaller pieces during lithic
reduction, while chert may be more susceptible to fragmentation.
The amount of dorsal cortex was recorded for complete flakes, proximal flake fragments, and
medial/distal fragments (see Table 33). Three categories were employed: cortex on more than 50
percent of dorsal surface, cortex covering up to 50 percent of dorsal surface, and entirely decorticate
dorsal surface. Chert, quartzite, and Rancheria chert have high percentages of decorticate debitage.
In contrast, over half of the obsidian debitage retains some cortex, reflecting its origin as small river
gravels (see below).
Tabulation of complete flake sizes among the material types (Table 34) indicates that most flakes fall
in the 11 to 20 mm category, regardless of material type. Small flakes (1 to 10 mm) are primarily comprised of chert and quartzite. Obsidian and Rancheria chert are absent from the largest flake categories
(31+ mm), suggesting that those raw materials come from smaller nodules.

Chipped Stone Raw Materials and Distribution
The raw materials comprising the chipped stone sample from Hueco Tanks were examined to determine their distribution by locality, the relative quantities of materials used in certain artifacts and time
periods, and the relationship of the Tanks to source areas. The goal of this analysis was to search for patterns in the use, distribution, and/or procurement of raw materials among the localities and over time.
Determining the primary source areas for chipped stone raw materials in the Hueco Bolson and
adjacent areas is difficult because of (1) the variety exhibited by raw materials within and between
source areas, (2) the widespread occurrence of secondary deposits, and (3) the paucity of systematic
identification and sampling of source areas (Carmichael 1986a:161-162; Church et al. 1996; Mauldin et
al. 1998:77; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:235). A comprehensive study of lithic resources in the Jornada
Mogollon area (Church et al. 1996) attempted to identify raw material source areas by collecting materials from known locations and compiling standardized descriptions through macroscopic and microscopic examination. The resulting criteria can be used to associate many lithic materials with geologic
formations, and a few with specific locations. Raw materials in gravel deposits in a 5 square km area of
the Hueco Bolson also have been analyzed (Mauldin et al. 1998:77-79).
Debitage is the most abundant artifact type in the Hueco Tanks chipped stone sample (Table 35)
so is particularly suited to examining differences in raw material distribution between localities. Contrasting this sample with the distribution of raw materials in the tools and cores (Table 36) allows for
patterns of raw material importation and reduction to be discerned.
Chert makes up 58 percent of the debitage and represents the highest percentage of material in all
of the chipped stone artifact categories. Chert debitage was found in every locality and is evenly distributed among them with two exceptions, an unusually high amount (88 percent) in WS2, and a lower
than average amount (40 percent) in SB2 (see Table 35). Most tools and cores also are made of chert
(see Table 36). Because chert tool percentages substantially exceed the percentage of chert debitage, it
appears that some chert tools were brought to Hueco Tanks in partially or fully finished form. Chert
comprises a higher percentage of the arrow points than the dart points, indicating intensification in
the use of this material in the Formative Period. All of these indicators point to a readily available chert
source in the vicinity of Hueco Tanks. Martin and Sommer (1974:6) note that several chert deposits had
been located and recorded within a 5 mile radius of Hueco Tanks, but provide no further information.
Two lithic procurement sites have been located around 7 miles west of Hueco Tanks on the west flank of
a Hueco Mountain foothill, consisting of flaking debris from two types of coarse-grained chert nodules:

reddish-brown with tan cortex, and bluish-gray with white fossil inclusions (Lukowski et al. 1999:221223, 230; Miller 2007:2-7). In a sample from El Arenal, Tres Casitas, and five nearby sites located 8.5
miles southwest of the Tanks, chert and siltstone from Hueco Mountain sources comprise over 43 percent of the chipped stone assemblage (Miller 2007:11-10). Although several varieties of chert occur in
the Hueco Mountains, this stone also can be obtained from the Sacramento and Franklin Mountains
(Collins and Raney 2000:19-20), and secondary deposits on the alluvial plain (see Environmental Background section).
Quartzite comprises 32 percent of the debitage and 38 percent of the cores. It was found in every
locality, but is overrepresented in the debitage samples from three of them: CA7, ES2, and SB2 (see Table
35). In contrast, only 9 percent of the sample from WS2 is made of quartzite. Quartzite tools also are
underrepresented, particularly among the dart and arrow points (see Table 36); perhaps these mediumto coarse-grained materials were not suitable for projectiles. The relative abundance of quartzite in the
debitage and cores suggests that a source area may be near Hueco Tanks. The nearest known sources of
the medium- and coarse-grained materials included in the quartzite category are secondary deposits in
the Rio Grande gravels in the Hueco Bolson (Church et al. 1996:78-79; Mauldin et al. 1998:79-80), and
the silicified sandstones of the Bliss Formation in the Hueco Mountains (Whalen 1994a:112-113).
Obsidian debitage was recovered from 18 localities and represents 4 percent of the debitage (see
Table 35). Its proportion of the Hueco Tanks sample is inflated because every obsidian specimen noted
during the current investigations was collected (see Methods of Archeological Investigations section).
Nevertheless, the SB5 debitage sample has a greater-than-average proportion of obsidian. Obsidian
tools, particularly arrow points, are substantially overrepresented in comparison to obsidian debitage
(see Table 36), probably indicating that most obsidian tools were brought to Hueco Tanks in finished
form. A relative abundance of obsidian in late Formative assemblages also has been noted in the region
(Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:254).
Obsidian is the only material in the Hueco Tanks sample that was submitted for chemical source
identification. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) trace element analysis was conducted on 20 obsidian chipped
stone artifacts by the Archaeological XRF Laboratory of the University of California at Berkeley (Shackley 2003). They consisted of 2 Late Archaic dart points, 4 untyped Archaic dart point fragments, 2
Formative arrow points, and 12 pieces of debitage (Table 37). Four criteria were used for selecting the
obsidian artifacts: location, age, appearance, and type of artifact. Artifacts were selected from 16 localities to ensure that all areas of the park were represented. Six dart points and two arrow points were
selected to sample different time periods. Nine artifacts were chosen because of slight differences in
appearance: color (black, brown, or gray), presence/absence of inclusions, and/or presence/absence of
patina. The 12 pieces of debitage consisted of primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes, and angular debris.
Sixteen obsidian artifacts from Hueco Tanks were sourced to Cerro Toledo in the Jemez Mountains
of north-central New Mexico (see Table 37). One Archaic dart point fragment from CA5, one Formative
arrow point from SB2, and one piece of debitage from NE1 were sourced to Mount Taylor in northwest
New Mexico (Shackley 2003:6). Both of these materials are known to occur as small nodules in secondary deposits of ancestral Rio Grande gravels in the Hueco Bolson (Church 2000:659, 664; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:234). Due to its proximity to Hueco Tanks, the bolson is the most likely procurement
area for the obsidian comprising these artifacts. One piece of debitage from locality SB6 could not be
assigned to a source, but its proportions of trace elements are similar to known sources in northeast
Chihuahua, Mexico (Shackley 2003:3).
Rancheria chert constitutes a scant 2 percent of the debitage, and was recovered in relatively equal
percentages of the samples from 14 localities (see Table 35). NE1 yielded 10 of the 35 pieces recovered

during the current investigations. This material was used to make 5 percent of the dart points and 4
percent of the tools, but none of the arrow points were made of Rancheria chert. It derives from the
Rancheria Formation in the Hueco Mountains, including several outcrops located 4 to 9 km (3 to 6
miles) southwest and south of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site (Collins and Raney 2000:Map
40). It is also found in the Franklin Mountains and as secondary deposits in the Rio Grande gravels.
Although Rancheria chert is available in the general vicinity of Hueco Tanks, it does not appear to have
been sought for tool making.
Among the projectile points from Hueco Tanks, the only raw material that is sufficiently abundant
to examine for use over time is chert. The increased utilization of chert in arrow points in comparison
to dart points (see Table 36) is substantiated when projectile points are considered by period (Table 38).

Excluding small samples from the Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods, use of chert to make projectile points increased modestly but steadily from the Middle Archaic through the Formative period in
this sample. These finding are in contrast to a substantially larger sample from Fort Bliss in which use
of obsidian and Rancheria chert increased in the Late Archaic and Early Formative periods (Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004:233-234).

GROUND STONE
A total of 40 ground stone artifacts were analyzed: 23 recovered during the current investigations
(6 manos/fragments, 8 metate fragments, 7 undetermined fragments, and 2 pestle fragments) and 17
from the park collection (10 manos/fragments, 3 metate fragments, 2 undetermined, 1 pestle, and 1 cruciform). Items with convex surfaces were classed as manos and those with concave surfaces as metates.
Fragments with flat surfaces were classified as undetermined unless their shape and size was sufficient to
classify them as a mano or metate. The pestle and pestle fragments are cylindrical. The current sample
was obtained through surface collection of all observed ground stone artifacts, and from a shovel test
in CA5 that yielded one undetermined ground stone fragment. The provenience of the ground stone
artifacts is shown in Table 39.

Materials Recovered

Manos and Metates
A total of 37 manos and mano fragments, metate fragments, and undetermined fragments comprise the sample: 17 manos/fragments, 11 metate fragments, and 9 undetermined fragments. The current investigations recovered 6 manos/fragments, 8 metate fragments, and 7 undetermined fragments,
augmented by 11 manos/fragments, 3 metate fragments, and 2 undetermined fragments from the park
collection. The manos were recovered from 14 localities, the metate fragments from 9 localities, and
the undetermined fragments from 7 localities (see Table 39).
Nine of the manos are complete and eight are fragments. Four are ground on both sides, and four
others taper in thickness from one edge to the other. One of the fragments has a beveled grinding surface with two facets. Comparing the approximate surface area of the complete manos (maximum length
multiplied by maximum width), three are relatively small (33, 69, and 77 square cm); three are medium
(98 to 123 square cm); and three are relatively large (144 to 161 square cm). However, all nine are less
than 15 cm in length, which is the minimum size of large manos as defined by Hard, Mauldin, and
Raymond (1996:260). Four of the complete manos are sub-rectangular, and the other five are oval. In
comparison, 32 manos were recovered from excavations at Hueco Tanks Village, all of which are small
enough to fit in one hand (Kegley 1982:6, 29-30). Those manos are made of limestone, sandstone, and
porphyritic syenite, while the manos recovered during the current investigations are primarily made of
sandstone and quartzite, as shown in Table 40.
The 11 metate fragments range from 1.3 to 15 cm in maximum thickness. Five exhibit grinding
surfaces on both sides, including one from NW2 that has one convex surface indicating that it was used
as a mano after it was broken. Eight appear to be fragments of basin metates. Three are slab (flat) metate
fragments, including a thin porphyritic syenite metate from WS3 that is relatively complete, measuring
36 cm long, 24 cm wide, and 2.5
to 4 cm thick. Lacking basins

Nine ground stone fragments are too fragmentary to determine whether they were used as manos
or metates. Four are made of sandstone, two of porphyritic syenite, and one each of quartzite, rhyolite
(Ray Mauldin, personal communication 2006), and limestone.
Pestles
Two pestle fragments were recovered from SB6 during the current investigations, and the park
collection held one complete pestle from NW1. The complete pestle is 47 cm long, 9 to 11 cm thick,
weighs 6.8 kg (15 lb), and is made of what appears to be limestone. One end is polished and darkened
from use, and one side has been chipped above the center, possibly to provide a handhold. One of the
pestle fragments collected during the current investigations may be sandstone; the other fragment is a
granitic rock.
The complete pestle is large compared to the few other complete pestles reported from sites in the
vicinity. A quartzite pestle from Hot Well pueblo was 13 cm by 4 cm by 4.5 cm (Brook 1978a:11-12),
and a pestle from Sabina Mountain #2 pueblo (41EP4) made of âigneous rockâ was only 10 by 4 by 2 cm
and weighed 152 g (Brook 1980:45). A survey of the southern Tularosa Basin recovered 70 pestles; the
4 complete pestles pictured in the report range in length from approximately 22 to 38 cm (Carmichael
1986:170, 223).
Cruciform
A single obsidian cruciform from the park collection was found in NE1. It measures 16 by 13 by
7 mm, and would be classified as a Type II cruciform by Phelps (1966:2) due to its rectangular shape.
X-ray fluorescence indicates that it was made from Mount Taylor obsidian, which is present in secondary
context in the Rio Grande gravels (Shackley 2006; see Chipped Stone Raw Materials and Distribution).
Another obsidian cruciform from Hueco Tanks probably is from NE2, and is held by the family of
John Davis. It is square and measures 19 x 19 mm, and would be classified as a Type I cruciform by
262

Materials Recovered

Phelps (1966:2). Two cruciformsâpossibly including the Davis specimenâreportedly have been found
at Hueco Tanks (Phelps 1966:28).
Cruciforms are distributed across southern Arizona and New Mexico and northern Mexico, but
their occurrence in Texas is restricted to the El Paso area (Brook 1978b:6). The Villa Ahumada area of
Chihuahua, Mexico has produced the highest concentration of these artifacts (Ferg 1998:560; Phelps
1966:28). Brook (1978b:6) stated that as of 1978 only five specimens in Texas had been reported in
publications: two obsidian cruciforms from Ceremonial Cave (41EP19; Alves 1930:Plate 19, Figure 1);
one obsidian cruciform from 10 miles east of El Paso (Compton 1957); a bone cruciform found 7 miles
north of El Paso in association with El Paso phase ceramics (Brook 1966a:574); and a ceramic cruciform
from an El Paso phase room at Hot Well pueblo (Brook 1975:21). Another obsidian cruciform was
recovered from the El Paso phase Sabina Mountain #2 pueblo (Brook 1978b:7). Although most cruciforms were made of obsidian, a wide variety of other stones were used, including felsite, andesite, basalt,
quartz, agate, onyx, chert, rhyolite, and pitchstone (Phelps 1966:29). The majority of cruciforms were
formed by pecking, grinding, and polishing, but some were chipped (Brook 1966a:574).
Firm provenience and chronological data are lacking for most cruciforms because they have been
found on the surface by collectors (Phelps 1966:15-17). More cruciforms have been found in Archaic
contexts (70 to 73 percent) than in ceramic contexts (27 to 30 percent), and the latter probably are
heirloom artifacts scavenged from Archaic sites (Carrig 2005:45; Ferg 1998:562-564; Phelps 1966:19,
29). The function of cruciforms is not known, although speculation on their use has included atlatl
weights, buttons, earrings, gaming pieces, and religious objects (Carrig 2005:45; Ferg 1998:567-572;
Phelps 1966:5-8).

HEAT SPALLS
Forty-four heat spalls were separated from the debitage during analysis because they are too fragmentary to identify as tools or debitage. These artifacts exhibit flake features as well as characteristic
indications of burning, like pot-lid fractures. Forty heat spalls were recovered from shovel tests and 4
were collected in a dog leash surface collection from SB5. Thirty-two of the heat spalls are chert, 11 are
quartzite, and 1 is Rancheria chert (Table 42).

FOSSILS
Nine unmodified fossils were recovered, three during the survey and six from the park collection.
Fossils occur in the limestone formations of the Hueco Mountains (see Environmental Background
section), and could have been transported to Hueco Tanks by natural processes. They also could have
been brought by humans, possibly in prehistoric times, because ornaments made from fossils have been
found on El Paso phase sites in the southern Jornada Mogollon area (see Prehistoric Background section). The fossils from Hueco Tanks are unmodified, however.
The three fossils found during the survey are a small unidentifiable fragment from the surface of
SB5, a pelecypod (bivalve) cast from a shovel test in ES2, and a crinoid columnal (stem segment) from
the surface of NE1. The columnal has a natural central perforation and may have been used as a bead;
similar crinoid columnals were found at the Pow Wow site (41EP32) and with other beads in caches at
Hot Well pueblo (Brook 1985:71-72).

The six fossils in the park collection are two gastropod (snail) molds from CA7 and NW2, two rocks
containing gastropod and other molds from CA2 and SB3, a coral mold from CA5, and a brachiopod
mold from WS1.

FIBER AND WOOD ARTIFACTS
Two artifacts from the park collection are made of plant materials. A basket rim fragment was collected from a packrat midden in a rockshelter above CA7. A group of cord fragments from a net was collected in WS3, probably from a rockshelter. These specimens were examined by Dr. Kenneth M. Brown,
Research Associate at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin,
who wrote the following description.
The rim fragment from CA7 is from a coiled basket and is 8.44 cm long, 1.47 cm wide, and 0.77
cm thick. Based on its curvature, the orifice of the basket was around 20 cm in diameter. The specimen
is fragile, caked with sediment, and poorly preserved; some parts are so deteriorated that they have a
carbonized appearance (Figure 73a). At Granado Cave, Hamilton (2001:104) noted charring of interior
stitches on a parching tray, but that does not seem to be the case here; instead, the dark color of some
truncated stitches appears to be due to deterioration.
The warp elements of coiled baskets can be whole wooden rods, rods split lengthwise, or bundles
of fiber. This specimen is an example of close coiling on a whole rod foundation. The rods are thin
(about 3.4 mm in diameter) withes of some type of wood with a soft, pithy core (at Pendejo Cave,
Rhus sp. rods were used; at Granado Cave, cottonwood twigs; and at Hinds Cave, willow). Interlaid
parallel to the wooden rods are narrow strips of what appear to be split agave leaves that are only evident when examined under magnification. This technique does not seem to be reported by Cosgrove
(1947), Andrews and Adovasio (1980), McGregor (1992), Ward (1992), Hamilton (2001), or Hyland
et al. (2003). The leaf strips have not been processed, and retain epidermis. The weft or stitching elements are similar leaf strips that are 0.14 to 0.28 mm wide (about 0.22 mm on average). They appear
to run over the rods, but penetrate the lateral leaf strips. The stitches may not be interlocked, but the
specimen is too incomplete and dirty to be certain. Stitches penetrate at least one of the interlaid
264

Materials Recovered

leaf strips, and one stitch also penetrates
a wooden rod. A few stitches appear to
penetrate previous stitches, but it is not
clear whether this is intentional, and
there is not enough evidence to classify
the fragment as split-stitch coiling.

The five fragments of two-ply,
S-spun, Z-twist cordage from WS3 probably come from a single net, although
they differ somewhat in appearance.
One fragment is darkly stained with
amberat or some other kind of urine
(Figure 73b). The best preserved fragment is tightly wound (7 twists per cm)
and has a diameter of about 1.4 to 1.6
mm; each ply is about 1 mm in diameter. The fragment has a knot at each end
spaced 5.4 cm apart, which presumably
is the approximate size of the net mesh.
The other fragments have one knot each,
with three to four segments of cord protruding from the knot. All of the knots
are identical, and appear to be sheet
bends.

On four fragments of cordage the
twist has relaxed to as few as 3.5 twists
b
per cm, and the diameter of the cord has

expanded to 1.7 to 2.9 mm. Each ply is
made of roughly four to nine strands
cm
of fiber; the strands range from 0.20 to
Figure 73. Fiber and wood artifacts. (a) Basket rim fragment

around 0.20 to 0.25 mm. Assuming the
relaxed specimens are not representative
of the original cordage, the tightly wound sections of cord are considerably finer than the cordage
from Fresnal Rockshelter (Moots 1990:Table 12).
The fiber comprising the cordage probably is agave, based on microscopic comparison with modern
samples of Agave lechuguilla, Dasylirion texanum, Hesperaloe parviflora, Yucca reverchonii, Nolina sp.,
and Typha sp. fiber. Nolina also compares reasonably well. Samples of Agave gracilipes and A. neomexicana fiber were not available for comparison, but also may be good candidates.
Netting like this could represent part of a hunting net or net carrying bag, but the apparent 5.4 cm
mesh size indicates that a hunting net is more likely (Cosgrove 1947:73). As netted pack frames usually
had knotless netting, this cordage probably is not part of a netted pack frame. It is more comparable to a
large hunting net from Shelby Brooks Cave, on which mesh openings are rectangular (6.4 cm horizontal
by 7.8 cm vertical), all of the knots are sheet bends, and the cordage is S-spun Z-twist and measures
about 2 mm in diameter (Ward 1992:76).

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

In the vicinity of Hueco Tanks, similar basketry and cordage fragments have been recovered from caves
in Hueco Mountain outliers (Cosgrove 1947:71-73, 99-113; OâLaughlin 1977:174; see Prehistoric Background). Two miles north of Hueco Tanks, a well-preserved basket found in a porphyritic syenite outcrop
had a 15 cm diameter orifice and contained gourds and bone ornaments (El Paso Times, February 23, 1937).

PREHISTORIC SHELL ARTIFACTS
Thirty-three specimens that are certainly or possibly made of shell date to the prehistoric period.
Four small unmodified shell fragments were recovered from the surface of SB5 during the survey. Another
29 shell items come from the park collection, consisting of 27 shell disk beads, 1 shell or stone bead, and
1 perforated freshwater mussel shell. The nearest source of shell is the Rio Grande, some 23 miles south
of Hueco Tanks. Based on the context of shell artifacts found in other sites across the southern Jornada
Mogollon area, the modified shells from Hueco Tanks are likely to date to the Formative period (A.D.
200 to 1450), and possibly the El Paso phase (A.D. 1300 to 1450; see Prehistoric Background section).
The 27 disk beads come from a group of 54 beads reportedly collected from a rockshelter in NE1 by
a visitor; half of the beads were given to an acquaintance, who later returned them to the park (Wanda
Olszewski, personal communication 2006). The beads are white with brown stains, 1 to 2 mm thick, and
13 to 15 mm in diameter; each has a 2 mm diameter hole drilled in the center. They apparently were made
of freshwater mussel shell from the Rio Grande, although ornaments made from shells of species native to
the Pacific Coast and Gulf of California also have been found in the region (Lowry 2005:201-205; Southward 1979:100-102). Similar shell disk beads have been recovered from El Paso phase sites in the Hueco
Bolson, often in caches like those at Hot Well pueblo and near Sabina Mountain (Brook 1985:70-72).
The other bead is in the park collection from CA4 and is made of shell or calcite, materials that can
be very difficult to distinguish (Whalen 1994a:128). The bead is 6 mm in diameter and 2 mm thick, with
a 2 mm diameter hole drilled in the center. One side is slightly curved, possibly reflecting the natural
curve of the parent material. It resembles a small shell bead recovered from an intrusive pit in the floor
of House 3 at Hueco Tanks Village (NE2; Kegley 1982:30, Figure 15e). Calcite occurs in limestone and
dolomite formations throughout the Hueco Bolson, and seven calcite beads were recovered at Turquoise Ridge (41EP762; Whalen 1994a:128). Ceremonial Cave contained âwhite stone beadsâ (Cosgrove
1947:151-152, Figure 146h), which may be calcite.
One perforated freshwater mussel shell is in the park collection from CA5. It is the left valve of the
giant floater (Anodonta grandis), a mussel that inhabits the beds of all major streams in Texas (Howells
et al. 1996:36-38), so it could have been collected from the Rio Grande. The shell is 9 cm long and has a
3 mm diameter hole drilled near the hinge. It may have been used as a pendant, and resembles a mussel
shell pendant found in Ceremonial Cave (Cosgrove 1947:152, Figure 147g).

FAUNAL REMAINS
A total of 186 animal bones and bone fragments were recovered during the survey: 157 during the
current investigations and 29 from the park collection. The bones were analyzed by Brian Shaffer, a
faunal analyst and Southwestern archeologist (Appendix D).
Eighteen shovel tests in 16 localities yielded 157 bones, including 12 specimens collected from a
dog-leash surface collection around a shovel test (see Methods of Investigations section). The number

266

Materials Recovered

of bones and fragments recovered from each shovel test ranged from 1 to 34 pieces. Seven shovel tests
yielded over 10 bone fragments apiece, and the remainder yielded 4 or fewer bone fragments. The bones
were recovered at depths of less than 10 cm to 90 cm below surface, but were concentrated in the upper
levels of the tests; 87 percent (n = 137) were recovered between 0 cm and 50 cm below surface.
Only five small complete bones were recovered from the tests; the rest are fragmentary, and most
are less than 3 cm in maximum dimension. Shaffer recorded several taphonomic attributes, including
two that sometimes indicate human activity: type of breakage and evidence of burning. Spiral fractures
occur when a bone still retains collagen, and on archeological sites they often indicate processing for
marrow or grease. Burned bones can be evidence of food processing, although they also can be caused
by natural fires. The sample includes 39 bones (25 percent) with spiral fractures, and 51 burned bones
(32 percent). The fact that many of the bones were buried suggests they may be of prehistoric age, but at
least a few specimens probably were introduced more recently by burrowing animals.
Shaffer identified the faunal remains to the most specific taxon possible. Four primary categories
were represented: Vertebrata, Mammalia, Reptilia, and Aves (Table 43). The subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) is composed of 62 fragments (39 percent of the sample) that could not be identified more
specifically due to their small size and poor condition. The class Mammalia (mammal) bone comprises
52 percent of the sample (n = 83). The Reptilia (reptiles) and Aves (birds) classes make up 8 percent
(n = 10) and 1 percent (n = 2) of the sample, respectively.
Mammals are represented by four groups: the orders Lagomorpha, Artiodactyla, Rodentia, and
unidentified. Forty-nine bones are too fragmentary to identify more specifically than mammal, and
two-thirds of them represent medium to large (deer-sized) mammals. The largest group of identifiable
mammal bones is Lagomorpha, with 28 in the family Leporidae (rabbits and hares) represented by cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.) and jackrabbit (Lepus sp.). Both animals were a major part of the faunal
assemblage at Hueco Tanks Village (Kegley 1982:21), and are seen daily throughout the park (Wanda
Olszewski, personal communication 2009).
The order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates) is represented by two unidentifiable bones and one
bone identified as Odocoileus sp. Deer remains were found at Hueco Tanks Village (Davidson 1982).
Mule deer live in the nearby Hueco Mountains (Worthington 1996a:92), and currently are seen in the
park once or twice a year (Wanda Olszewski, personal communication 2009).
The order Rodentia (rodents) is represented by one unidentifiable bone and two identified as wood
rat (Neotoma sp). This genus was recovered from Hueco Tanks Village (Davidson 1982:75) and is common throughout the park.
The class Reptilia (reptiles) is represented by bones from the order Testudinata (turtles) and the
suborder Serpentes (snakes). Four carapace fragments from an unidentified turtle were recovered,
along with one from the box turtle (Terrapene sp). The families Colubridae (mainly non-poisonous
snakes) and Viperidae (vipers) are represented by five vertebrae. The excavations at Hueco Tanks Village
recovered remains of a box turtle and two species of rattlesnake: Crotalus atrox and viridis (Davidson
1982:75). Snakes are common at Hueco Tanks (Worthington 1996a:71-74). Turtles are not common in
the park but are seen once or twice a year (Wanda Olszewski, personal communication 2009).
The class Aves is represented by two bone fragments that refit and come from a subadult turkey
(Meleagris gallopavo). Wild turkeys currently are rare in the region (Mark Lockwood, personal communication 2009); by 1907 hunters had extirpated them from their nearest range in the Guadalupe
Mountains, 90 miles east of Hueco Tanks (Lockwood and Freeman 2004:17). The bones were recovered
from the uppermost 20 cm of a shovel test in association with glass and aluminum foil; radiocarbon
assay later determined that they are modern (see Appendix B).

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Materials Recovered

In addition to the bones from shovel tests, 29 bone fragments from the park collection were collected from the surface. Twenty-one were found in a group and date to the late Pleistocene; they are discussed separately below. Eight other bone fragments were collected from localities CA5, CA7, and ES1.
One of the two fragments from CA5 is the proximal radius of a sheep (Ovis) or goat (Capra). It
exhibits cut marks made by a hand saw. The other fragment is part of a rib from a deer- or cow-sized
mammal, and exhibits cut marks made by a modern band saw. Both fragments date to the historic
ranching period or later.
The proximal radius of a deer (Odocoileus sp.) was recovered from CA7, apparently washed out of a
ravine below a pictograph site. Shaffer notes that it was cut using the groove and snap technique, which
often is associated with prehistoric faunal remains. The cut end is too badly weathered to identify the type
of toolâstone or metalâused to cut the groove. The uncut end is not weathered, suggesting that it had
been buried (see Appendix D); the bone also retains bone grease or collagen. It was found downstream
from a modern trash pile that is exposed in the side of the ravine, buried about one meter below surface.
Four long bone fragments from ES1 are from a large mammal the size of a deer or cow, but are too
fragmentary for further identification. A fifth bone is a femur fragment from a cow or bison. All of these
bones have spiral fractures indicating they were broken while fresh, and are unburned. Remains of bison
or cow also were recovered from Hueco Tanks Village (Davidson 1982:75).
The eight bones from the park collection apparently represent historic and/or modern activities
related to ranching and hunting. Cattle were raised on the Escontrias ranch (see Historical Background
section), sheep and goats may have been food items, and deer were hunted. The grooved and snapped
deer bone may be prehistoric or historic.
Dating to the late Pleistocene, a group of bones from the park collection consists of 1 long bone segment and some 20 small fragments that were exposed in the wall of an arroyo in CA6 at an unspecified
depth. The bones were encased in calcium carbonate matrix. After the matrix was removed, Dr. Pamela
Owen of the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin identified the large
fragment as the distal left tibia of Equus spp., an extinct horse; the associated small fragments apparently
are from the same individual. At least four species of horse lived in the region during the Pleistocene,
and their teeth and leg bones are commonly found (Harris 2000:3). The closest reported recovery of
Equus bones was in Ceremonial Cave, 5 miles west of Hueco Tanks (Cosgrove 1947:36; Creel 1997:86).
Approximately 100 miles to the northeast at Dry Cave in southeastern New Mexico, several hundred
elements of extinct horse were dated between 15,000 and 10,700 radiocarbon years before present (Harris and Porter 1980:46). Based on the likely age of Equus, the bones in the arroyo in CA6 probably were
recovered from the calcium carbonate stratum at the top of the Q2 sedimentary unit (see Environmental Background section; Blair et al. 1990:200).

HISTORIC ARTIFACTS
The 277 historic artifacts consist primarily of shaped glass fragments (45 percent); the remainder
are roughly equivalent quantities of ceramic sherds, building materials, other metal artifacts, and armament, augmented by a few buttons and a bead (Table 44). Over 75 percent of these items were recovered
in NE4, from two shovel tests and surface collections near the Escontrias ranch house. Twenty-one
historic artifacts were recovered from CA7, and the remaining 12 localities produced 8 or fewer historic
artifacts. Items recovered during the survey total 220, and 57 items come from the park collection,
almost half of which are ammunition.

Shaped Glass
The 126 shaped glass fragments do not include substantial parts of any vessels. Most of the fragments are less than 40 mm in maximum dimension, and provide little information on makerâs marks,
mold marks, or neck and lip characteristics of the original vessels. The 102 clear glass fragments comprise 81 percent of the sample, and the 24 colored glass fragments make up the remainder (Table 45).
Two pieces of glass were found in the park collection; the rest were recovered during the survey.
The 102 clear glass fragments were recovered from two shovel tests in NE4. Two fragments are
decorated, one with a pattern of squares and one with ribs. One small lamp chimney fragment retains
a petal lip and may date to the late nineteenth century. The 23 clear glass fragments from Shovel Test
30 include 3 base sherds that fit together and

Distillery (Alvarado Ãlvarez 2007). During the Prohibition years from 1922-1932, the D. M. Distillery
and others in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez were the main suppliers of alcohol to El Paso (Alvarado Ãlvarez 2007).
Six clear glass fragments are paneled, including one with the embossed letters â¦SSOR. It is probably part of a bottle with the embossed letters: CALIFORNIA FIG SYRUP CO\CALIFIG STERLING
PRODUCTS (INC.) SUCCESSOR. This laxative was first produced around 1878 by the California Fig
Syrup Co. in San Francisco, but the headquarters were destroyed by the 1906 earthquake. Sterling Products (Inc.) of Wheeling, West Virginia, purchased the company sometime after that and continued to
produce the fig syrup through the 1970s (Fike 2006:225, 303).
The 24 colored shaped glass fragments consist of 11 amber fragments, 6 green fragments, 3 aqua
fragments, 3 solarized fragments, and 1 white milk glass fragment. All of them were recovered from
shovel tests during the survey, except 1 aqua fragment and the 3 solarized fragments. Almost half of the
colored glass consists of amber fragments from CA7, NE1, and NE4. One of the amber sherds from NE4
is fluted. Amber was a common glass color throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and is
still used for beer bottles because it blocks light that could damage the beer (Lindsey 2007).
The green fragments consist of one bright green, four light green, and one olive green. The bright
green fragment has a thin cut line and is from CA7. Bright green glass is almost always a product of
the twentieth century (Lindsey 2007). One light green fragment has wide ribs, and was recovered from
NE4; three other light green fragments also are from this locality. The olive green glass fragment is from
NE4; it is patinated but has no distinguishing characteristics. Olive green glass was commonly used in
the nineteenth century for a variety of products; since around 1900 it has been used primarily for wine,
champagne, and scotch liquor bottles (Lindsey 2007).
The most notable aqua glass sherd is a base with paneled sides found in the park collection from
NE4. It appears to be from a conical, eight-sided âumbrellaâ ink bottle, a style that was popular from
the 1820s to the 1890s (Munsey 1970:120, 123). Two other aqua glass fragments from NE4 do not have
distinctive attributes. Aqua was a common color in American-made bottles from the early nineteenth
century to the 1920s; after that it was used primarily for fruit jars, particularly those made by the Ball
Company through at least the late 1930s (Lindsey 2007).
The three solarized glass fragments consist of two rim sherds (including one from the park collection) and one base recovered from the surface of NE4. One of the rim sherds has thin ribs starting 11
mm below the lip, and may be from the rim of a drinking glass. The base fragment is ribbed on the edge.
Solarized glass was made between 1880 and 1915, when manufacturers used manganese to decolorize clear glass (Munsey 1970:55); the purple color is produced by a reaction of manganese to the sunâs
ultraviolet rays.
The white milk glass rim fragment from NE4 has two horizontal ribs below the lip and a seam running up to the lip, indicating that it was machine-made sometime after 1905 (Lindsey 2007). Milk glass
was commonly used for cosmetic and toiletry bottles from the 1870s to 1920, and for ointment/cream
jars from the 1890s to the 1950s (Lindsey 2007).
Historic Ceramics
The 35 ceramic sherds initially were sorted under the guidance of former Texas Parks and Wildlife Department archeologist Art Black. The Mexican ceramics were identified with the assistance of
ceramic specialists Anne Fox of the University of Texas at San Antonio (retired), Regge Wiseman of the
Museum of New Mexico, and Patricia Fournier of the Instituto Nacional de AntropologÃ­a e Historia,
271

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Mexico. Munsell Soil Color Charts (Munsell Color Company 2000) were used to describe selected
colors. The sherds were divided into two broad categories: ceramics of probable Mexican origin, and
ceramics of European or American origin (Table 46). The 10 Mexican ceramics consist of wheel-made
unglazed, burnished, slipped, lead-glazed, and tin-enameled earthenware, and include 4 sherds from
the park collection. The 25 sherds of European/American origin are divided into undecorated whiteware, decorated whiteware, yellowware, and porcelain; 6 are from the park collection. One ceramic
poker chip fragment also was recovered. Six of the historic ceramics were recovered from shovel tests
during the survey.

Two wheel-made unglazed earthenware sherds in the park collection from CA7 may have been
made in Mexico or border settlements. The body sherd is quite thick (11.2 mm) and nearly flat, and
appears to be from the base of a vessel. Its interior surface is finely striated and the exterior is smoothed.
The paste is light brown (7.5YR6/4) and is tempered with sand, mica, and crushed quartz. The rim sherd
is from a jar with a slightly everted lip and an orifice diameter of 8 cm. Its manufacture is indicated
by fine striations on the interior and exterior. The sherd is 5.4 mm thick, and made of reddish yellow
(5YR6/6) paste with sparse, fine sand temper. Wheel-made pottery in the El Paso area postdates the
earliest Spanish settlement in 1659 (see Historical Background section).
One large burnished earthenware sherd in the park collection from CA4 comes from the constricted
neck of an olla that had an orifice greater than 40 cm in diameter, based on its curvature. The interior is
burnished and the exterior is roughly finished, with numerous uneven striations indicating that the pot

272

Materials Recovered

was hand-built. The paste is very pale brown (10YR 7/4), and is tempered with sand and other materials
that appear to be volcanic (Regge Wiseman, personal communication 2008). Burnished vessels of this
type dating to the historic period are found across northern Chihuahua and southern Texas (Patricia
Fournier, personal communication 2009), but cannot be dated precisely.
Three slipped earthenware body sherds collected from the surface during the survey are thought
to derive from Mexico; their hardness indicates that they were fired at relatively high temperatures, but
all of them appear to be hand-built. Two of the sherds are from CA5; one of them retains patches of
brown (10YR4/3) slip on the exterior and interior that have a crackled appearance. Its very pale brown
(10YR7/3) paste is tempered with crushed rock, sand, and possibly shell. The second sherd has light reddish brown (5YR6/4) paste and large, angular crushed rock and sand temper. The exterior is smoothed
and the interior has small remnants of dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) slip, leading to its identification
as a bowl fragment. The third specimen is a body sherd from SB7, with a light reddish brown (5YR6/4)
slip on the exterior that has partially exfoliated. The interior of the sherd is smoothed, and the light gray
(10YR7/2) paste is tempered with coarse sand.
Three small lead-glazed earthenware sherds were recovered from NE4 during the survey, two from
shovel tests. The single rim sherd is covered with remnants of green glaze on the rim and both surfaces,
and appears to be wheel-made. One of the two body sherds is glazed on the interior surface and has
black paint on the exterior. The other body sherd is glazed on both surfaces and has remnants of black
paint on one surface. Lead-glazed earthenware manufacture in Mexico began soon after the Spanish
conquest and has continued to the present (Fournier 1999:154).
One tin-enameled earthenware rim sherd in the park collection from NE2 is majolica. It has finetextured pink (5YR7/3) paste, opaque glossy cream-colored enamel, and a blue band on both sides of the
rim. A blue-on-white color scheme was emphasized on eighteenth-century majolica wares, superseded
by a green-and-orange polychrome tradition that extended through the nineteenth century (Deagan
1987:79, 87). Mexican majolica production initially was centered in Puebla and Mexico City; during the
later colonial period, production spread to a number of communities including Guanajuato and Oaxaca
(Deagan 1987:87; Williams and Cohen-Williams 2004:6-10). This sherd appears to have a relatively late
date of manufacture, and probably was made somewhere other than Puebla or Mexico City (Anne Fox,
personal communication 2008).
The European/American ceramics are primarily whiteware. Five undecorated white earthenware
sherds were recovered, three during the survey (two from shovel tests) and two from the park collection.
The two rim sherds, one base sherd, one handle fragment, and one body sherd are from plain vessels or
undecorated areas of decorated vessels. Undecorated whiteware was the most affordable type of pottery
available during the late eighteenth century through the nineteenth century (Miller 1991:3) and is still
produced today, so the five sherds cannot be dated precisely.
The 12 decorated whiteware sherds are classified as annular, hand painted, transfer printed, mold
decorated, and decal decorated. The term annular as used here refers to the decorative style of a simple
band or line painted around the rim, and is similar to Millerâs (1991:7) band-and-line type. This style
is most often associated with institutional wares, particularly hotel wares that were common from the
late nineteenth century to the late 1950s (Miller 1991:7). The three annular rim sherds are from the
surface of NE4; two were collected during the survey and one is from the park collection. One sherd has
a light blue band and two are gold banded. The latter appear to represent the two gilding techniques
most commonly used on relatively inexpensive whiteware in the last half of the nineteenth century. The
band on one of the rims is almost worn away, a common fate of the liquid gold method which was not
wear resistant (Majewski and OâBrien 1987:153). The band on the other rim is completely intact and

273

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

probably was applied by the bright burnished gold method, a technique that became common after
about 1870 and is still used (Miller 1991:10).
Three hand-painted sherds were recovered. A scalloped rim fragment in the park collection from
CA1 has a light blue line and dots along the rim, with thick-lined red flowers and dark green leaves on
the body. Of the two hand-painted sherds collected from the surface of NE4 during the survey, one small
body sherd has a thick-lined monochrome cobalt blue decoration, while a base sherd has light yellow
and green leaves painted in broad brush strokes with several thin black lines.
Two blue transfer-printed body sherds collected from the surface of NE4 during the survey may date
to the nineteenth century. Transfer-printed ceramics were first developed in the mid-seventeenth century,
but techniques for underglaze transfer printing were not in common use until the 1790s (Gross 1996). The
first color used for transfer printing was blue; the peak period of production for blue underglaze transferprinted wares was between 1820 and 1840 (Majewski and OâBrien 1987:142), but they are still made today.
Two mold-decorated sherds were recovered from the surface. A large fragment of a whiteware plate
rim with a scroll design was found in the park collection from NW3. A small body sherd from NE4 found
during the survey is painted light bluish gray over a raised design. Relief molded decoration became popular around 1840 and continued to be made until well past 1900 (Majewski and OâBrien 1987:153-154).
Three decal decorated sherds include a rim sherd and a body sherd with underglaze designs;
both were collected from NE4 during the survey, one from a shovel test. The rim has remnants
of a gold line with a bright blue line below, encircling a floral design consisting of purple flowers
with star-shaped centers and light green leaves. The body sherd is very small, but appears to have
a similar design. This type of design was popular on decal decorated earthenware during the very
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (Majewski and OâBrien 1987:146-147). The third decal
decorated sherd was found in the park collection from CA7. It is a fragment from a thick white
earthenware mug, bearing the faint trace of a decal of the seal of the United States Naval Academy
of Annapolis, Maryland. The complete seal includes a trident and shield and the words EX SCIENTIA TRIDENS (from knowledge, sea power; United States Naval Academy 2008). The seal was
approved in 1899 and appears on a wide variety of merchandise currently sold by the Academy,
including mugs, so the sherd dates to the twentieth century. Its presence at Hueco Tanks is not surprising given the proximity of Fort Bliss and the frequent visits of military personnel to the park.
One yellowware base sherd was recovered from the surface of NE4 during the survey. The exterior has a
clear glaze with the impressed number 1 followed by at least one more number that is illegible. The interior
surface has a glossy mottled yellow and brown glaze that resembles tortoiseshell. It is known as Rockingham
or Bennington glaze and contains manganese or iron salts in addition to lead oxide (Ramsay 1976:21, 147).
Yellowware was produced and distributed in the United States between 1830 and 1900 (Ramsay 1976:148).
Five porcelain sherds were recovered from the surface of NE4 during the survey, consisting of one
undecorated annular base fragment from the park collection and four decorated rim sherds recovered
during the survey. The interior surface of one of the rim sherds is decorated with a light blue band
between two thin brown lines. Three rim sherds have diverse exterior decoration: blue transfer-printed,
reddish brown decal pattern, and light brown overglaze painted. The latter has a scalloped edge with a
Japanese-style pattern that was common on tea sets from the 1930s to 1950s.
One small fragment of a white ceramic poker chip was recovered from a shovel test in CA7 during
the survey. It has a band of parallel incised lines extending 7 mm inward from the edge. Clay composition
poker chips were manufactured primarily from the late 1880s to the late 1930s. White, blue, and yellow
were the most common colors, and there were over 1000 available designs (Seymour 1998).

Materials Recovered

Building Materials
Building materials are represented by 37 artifacts, consisting of 21 wire nails, 2 tacks, 1 fence staple,
1 pipe fitting, 1 wire screen fragment, 1 glass fuse, 1 lock keyhole, 8 pieces of tile, and 1 wood fragment
(Table 47). The fence staple, glass fuse, and lock keyhole are from the park collection. During the survey,
the wire nails, screen fragment, and wood fragment were recovered from shovel tests, and the tile and
pipe fitting were collected from the surface.
The wire nails consist of 17
severely rusted ferrous nails and
4 non-ferrous nails from NE4;
the complete nails range from 1
to 3 Â½ inches in length. Wire nails
became dominant in the 1890s
(Nelson 1968:10) and are still in
use. The two tacks are from NE4
and are non-ferrous. The fence
staple from NW3 is ferrous.

on one end, threads on the inside,
and an interior diameter of Â¾
inch. The ferrous wire screen fragment from NE4 is 1/16 inch mesh and may have been part of a window
screen. One ferrous item from ES1 appears to be the end cap for a keyhole lock; it measures Â½ inch long
and â inch in diameter. These items do not have distinguishing attributes and cannot be dated precisely,
but probably date to the twentieth century.
A plug-type household electrical fuse in the park collection from NE4 has a glass body, porcelain
core, and metal threads. It is 1Â¼ inches long and 1â inches in maximum diameter. GENERAL ELECTRIC CO. is embossed on the glass, and the number 30 is stamped on the cap. The General Electric
Company was formed in 1892 (General Electric Company 2008), and this style of fuse is still being used
in older houses today.
Seven small fragments of probable flooring tile from CA7 are â inch thick, light reddish tan, and
appear to be asphalt or Masonite. Six have black bands on one sideâprobably remnants of adhesiveâ
and one is solid brown. An eighth flooring tile fragment from CA5 has remnants of red slip on both
sides. One piece of wood was recovered from a shovel test in NE4; it is about two inches long, â inch
wide, and Â¼ inch thick, and appears to have been milled. These materials do not have distinguishing
attributes and cannot be dated precisely.
Other Metal Artifacts
Thirty-three other metal artifacts were recovered (Table 48). Seventeen of the items are unidentifiable rusted ferrous fragments recovered during the survey from shovel tests in NE4. The remaining
16 items are comprised of the following metals: 8 ferrous, 3 lead, 1 white metal, 1 cuprous, 1 tin, 1

silverâplated nickel steel, and 1 pressed steel. Six of them were collected from shovel tests during the
survey, and 10 are from the park collection.
The eight identifiable ferrous artifacts consist of a strap fragment, eye bolt fragment, Phillips screwdriver, leather hole punch, and horseshoe nail from the park collection; a rivet, bucket bail fitting, and
horseshoe fragment were collected during the survey from shovel tests. The strap fragment is from
NW3, and is 4Â¼ inches long, Â¾ inch wide, and â inch thick. The eye bolt fragment is from NE4, and is
6Â½ inches long with a 1â inch eye; it is heavily corroded and irregular, and appears to have been handforged. The Phillips screwdriver lacks a handle and is 4Â½ inches long; it was found in NW2. The leather
hole punch is from CA7; it is 3Â½ inches long and has a 1 inch groove near the hollow distal end. The
horseshoe nail is 15/16 inch long, and was found in NW3. The rivet was recovered from NW2 and measures 5/16 inch long by â inch in diameter. The bucket bail fitting comes from NE4, and is 1Â¼ inch in
diameter with a hole in the center. The horseshoe fragment from NE4 is so severely rusted that no measurements are possible. None of these artifacts have distinguishing attributes that allow for precise dating.
The three lead artifacts include one item in the park collection from NE4 that is 2 13/16 inches long,
15/16 inches wide, and Â¼ inch thick. An oval hole near one end has a maximum diameter of 9/16 inch;
an oval hole near the other end is Â¼ inch in maximum diameter. One edge has a â inch oval notch. One
side retains remnants of an adhesive or sealant and has the number 8 stamped in the center; the other
side has five small circular impressions made by another object that was attached to this item. Although
the age and function of this item is not certain, the non-conductive nature of lead combined with the
other attributes suggest that it may have been a gasket for some type of electrical mechanism. Two other
lead items recovered from a shovel test in NW2 are hollow cylindrical fragments about 1Â½ inches long
276

Materials Recovered

and Â¼ inch in outside diameter, with a 1/16 inch wide rectangular interior channel. The pieces have been
split in half longitudinally; their function and date of manufacture have not been determined.
One small piece of white metal was recovered from a shovel test in NE4. It appears to be die cast
zinc and is â inch thick. It is brittle and has a slight curve, but is too small to reveal its function or age.
The cuprous artifact is a grommet in the park collection from CA7. It is 1â inches in diameter and
has a Â½ inch diameter central hole. The grommet probably was attached to a tent or canopy, but has no
distinguishing characteristics and cannot be dated precisely.
A tin lapel pin comes from the park collection in NW3. It is â inch in diameter; printed on its face
are the words JUNIOR AMERICAN CITIZENS in dark blue on a white background, and three stars.
The Daughters of the American Revolution established the Junior American Citizens Committee in
1901 âto instill good citizenshipâ in students from kindergarten through twelfth grade (Daughters of
the American Revolution 2008). The pins have been given to every member of this group since around
1936, and the design has not changed (Baird 2008).
A spoon in the park collection from NW1 is stamped on the underside of the handle with NSCoEPNS, which stands for National Silver Company Electro Plated Nickel Steel. The company was founded
in 1890 in New York and became the National Silver Company sometime before 1904 (Rainwater
1975:117). The soup spoon measures 7 inches long; its pattern name and date of manufacture have not
been determined.
The pressed steel fuselage of a toy airplane was found in the park collection from NW1. It measures
7Â¼ inches long and is painted red. It is severely dented and lacks wings, tail, and undercarriage, and has
two bullet holes. Although it lacks markings, online research identified it as a model DC-2 manufactured by the Louis Marx Company in the late 1930s (Konow 2008). The company was founded in 1919
in New York City and was one of the largest toy manufacturers in the United States until its demise in
1978 (Wikipedia 2008).
Ammunition and Related Items
Thirty-six pieces of ammunition were recovered from 12 localities, along with 4 items related to
ammunition; over one-third of these items are from NE4 (Table 49). The ammunition consists of 29
cartridge cases, 3 complete unfired cartridges, and 4 lead bullets; ammunition-related items are 1 cartridge belt link and 3 pieces of lead slag. All of these items are from the park collection except 8 pieces of
ammunition that were recovered during the survey, 5 from shovel tests.
Ten of these artifacts are definitely military: a 45-70 rifle cartridge from CA7; six 30-06 rifle cases
from CA5 (3), ES3, and NE4 (2); a 45 Automatic pistol case fragment from ES1; a 50 caliber machine
gun case from NE4; and a 5.56x45 mm M16 rifle cartridge from NE4. Nine are commercial cartridges
that also were used by the military: the 22 Long Rifle (n = 5), 38 Smith & Wesson, 38 Smith & Wesson
Special, 9 mm Parabellum, and 12 gauge shotgun shell (Barnes 2006:513). The ammunition is discussed
chronologically based on the specific or earliest known dates of manufacture, which range from 1860 to
1972. Reign Clark, archeologist for Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. in Austin, Texas, assisted with
identifications based on his extensive knowledge of ammunition.
Two pieces of ammunition were initially manufactured in the 1860s. A 44 caliber Henry rimfire
cartridge case from NE2 was used in the Henry lever-action repeating rifle and its successor, the
Winchester Model 1866 repeating rifle (Barnes 2006:485). The case is flattened and there is a very faint

letter H headstamp in the center of the base. Multiple firing pin impressions around the edge of the base
indicate the cartridge was rotated after misfiring at least 4 times (Poche 2007). The 44 Henry cartridge
was manufactured from 1860/1861 to 1866 by the New Haven Arms Company (Connecticut), and from
1866 to 1934 by its successor, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company (Barnes 2006:485).
An unfired 56-50 rimfire cartridge from SB5 bears the headstamp S.A.W., which indicates that it
was manufactured between 1864 and 1867 by the Sage Ammunition Works of Middletown, Connecticut
(Merchant 2007; Steinhauer 2003b:12). This type of cartridge was used in the 1865 model of the Spencer
repeating carbine, and was produced by various manufacturers until 1920 (Barnes 2006:486).
Five items were initially manufactured in the 1870s. Two 44 caliber centerfire cartridge cases are
headstamped W.R.A. Co.\44 W.C.F., representing the Winchester Repeating Arms Company (New
Haven, Connecticut) and 44 caliber Winchester centerfire. More commonly known as the 44-40, this
cartridge was the first to be used successfully in both rifle and revolver, initially in the Winchester Model
1873 lever-action repeating rifle and subsequently in the 1878 Colt revolver (Barnes 2006:96). The two
cartridges were manufactured from 1873 to 1932, when the Winchester Repeating Arms Company
became Winchester Western. One is in the park collection from ES1, and the other was recovered from
a shovel test in NW3 during the survey.
A centerfire cartridge case fragment from CA7 lacks a headstamp but was identified by Reign Clark
(personal communication 2008). It is from a 45-70 caliber cartridge that was adopted by the U.S. military as the official service cartridge for the âTrapdoorâ Springfield single shot rifle from 1873 to 1892
(Barnes 2006:97). This type of cartridge is still manufactured today for use in several different brands
of rifles (Barnes 2006:97).
Two 38 caliber centerfire cartridge cases also were first manufactured in the 1870s for the Smith &
Wesson revolver, which was introduced around 1877 (Barnes 2006:301). The cartridge from NW2 is
headstamped W.R.A. Co. 38 S and was produced by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company from
ca. 1877 to 1932. The cartridge from NW1 is headstamped U.S. 38 S. & W. and was manufactured by
the United States Cartridge Company of Lowell, Massachusetts between ca. 1877 and 1938, when it was
purchased by Winchester (Steinhauer 2003a).

Materials Recovered

Three items first manufactured in the 1880s were recovered during the survey. A shovel test in CA7
yielded a 22 caliber blank cartridge case with an acorn headstamp. This symbol is used by the Rheinisch
Westfalischen Sprengstoff company in Germany, which was founded in 1886 and is still in production
today (Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners 2005; Barnes 2006:477). Two 22 Long Rifle
rimfire cases also were first made during this period; one comes from a shovel test in CA7 and the other
from the surface of NE4. They are headstamped U, representing the Union Metallic Cartridge Company
of Bridgeport, Connecticut, which was in production from 1867 to 1912, when it merged with Remington Arms Company (Steinhauer 2003b). The 22 Long Rifle cartridge was introduced in 1887 and is still
widely used for match shooting and hunting small game, and by the military (Barnes 2006:477, 513).
Two 30-30 centerfire rifle cartridge cases from NE4 were initially manufactured in the 1890s. One is
headstamped W.R.A. Co.\.30 W.C.F., which stands for Winchester Repeating Arms Company, 30 caliber
Winchester Center Fire. The .30 W.C.F. headstamp was used from 1895 until about 1946 (Kort 2008).
The other 30-30 cartridge case is a product of the Union Metallic Company, which used the headstamp
U.M.C. 30-30 from about 1898 until 1916, when it incorporated with Remington Arms (Farrar 2005).
Two items have initial manufacturing dates between 1900 and 1909. One is a shotgun shell from
NW1 that is headstamped WINCHESTER No 12 LEADER, which was first made in 1894 by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company of New Haven, Connecticut (Vinson 1968:91). This shotgun shell
predates 1920, when Winchester changed the gauge designation from No. 12 to 12 GA (Farrar 2005). A
centerfire cartridge case from NE4 has the headstamp W.R.A. Co.\.44 S&W SPâL, representing the Winchester Repeating Arms Company\ 44 caliber Smith & Wesson Special. Cartridges with this headstamp
were manufactured for revolvers from about 1907 to 1932, when the company became Winchester
Western (Barnes 2006:305; Steinhauer 2003a).
Two artifacts dating between 1910 and 1919 have military headstamps with one or more letters
identifying the manufacturing plant, and two numbers noting the year of manufacture. A 30-06 rifle
case collected during the survey from a shovel test in NE4 is headstamped U.S.C. Co\ 18, indicating
that it was made by the United States Cartridge Company of Lowell, Massachusetts in 1918. The 30-06
designation is derived from 30 caliber, developed in 1906 for the Model 1903 Springfield rifle (Barnes
2006:62). A dent in the side of this case was made by a 22 caliber bullet, indicating that the case had
been used for target practice (Reign Clark, personal communication 2008). The other artifact is in the
park collection from ES1, and is a 45 Automatic case fragment with the headstamp F A 18, made at the
Frankford Arsenal in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1918. Developed by John Browning in 1905, this
cartridge was adopted by the United States military in 1911 for use in the Colt-Browning automatic
pistol (Barnes 2006:309).
Six items have initial manufacturing dates in the 1920s, including four .22 Long Rifle cases and one
unfired .22 Long Rifle cartridge. Originally manufactured in 1922, the cartridges from CA4, CA7 (survey shovel test), and NE4 are marked SUPER X; the cartridge from NE2 has a diamond symbol. Both
headstamps were used by the Winchester Western company of New Haven, Connecticut (Steinhauer
2003b). The unfired 22 Long Rifle cartridge was collected during the survey from the surface of NE4; it
is headstamped F, denoting the Federal Cartridge Company of Anoka, Minnesota, which began making
22 caliber rimfire ammunition in 1924 (Decker 2008).
The sixth item in the 1920s group was recovered from the surface of NE4 during the survey. It is
the head of a shotgun shell headstamped WESTERN\MADE IN USA\No20\SUPER-X. This shotgun
shell was manufactured by the Western Cartridge Company of East Alton, Illinois from the 1920s until
1931/1932, and thereafter by its successor the Winchester-Western Company. Shotgun shells bearing the
Western Super-X headstamp were sold until around 1958 (Farrar 2005).

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Two military items date to the World War II period in the 1940s. One is a 50 caliber machine gun
case from NE4, headstamped S L 4 3. This case was manufactured in 1943 at the St. Louis, Missouri
Ordnance Plant, which was built and operated by the U.S. Cartridge Company from 1941 to 1945 (Farrar 2005). A 30-06 cartridge case from CA5 is headstamped U 43, and was made in 1943 at the Utah
Ordnance Plant in Salt Lake City, which was operated by Remington Arms Company from 1941 to 1943
(Frigiola 2002).
Four 30-06 cases produced in the 1950s were found in CA5 (two), ES3, and NE4. They have military
headstamps: two are L C 53 and two are L C 54. These cases were manufactured at the Lake City Ordnance Plant in Independence, Missouri in 1953 and 1954.
Two other cartridge cases may date to the 1950s. A case from NE4 is a 22 Magnum Rimfire with a
Super X headstamp, first introduced by Winchester in 1959 and still produced today (Barnes 2006:479).
A case from CA4 is headstamped REM-UMC\9 m/m LUGER, indicating that it was made by the Remington Arms Union Metallic Cartridge Company. Although the 9 mm Luger cartridge was introduced in
Germany in 1902 with the Luger automatic pistol, it was not popular in the United States until the 1950s
when American-made pistols were chambered for the cartridge (Barnes 2006:295).
Two full metal jacketed lead bullets from CA7 and NE4 cannot be precisely dated, but probably were
manufactured in the 1940s or 1950s. They were made for the 45 caliber Automatic Colt Pistol, originally
developed in 1904 and adopted by the U.S. Army in 1911 for the M1911 pistol (Barnes 2006:309; Mattioli 2007). A slightly modified version of the pistolâthe M1911A1âwas created in 1924, and production peaked in the years before, during, and after World War II (The Sight 2007), the most likely period
when these bullets were manufactured.
Perhaps the most recent piece of ammunition was manufactured in 1972. Recovered from NE4, this
unfired 5.56x45 mm centerfire cartridge is headstamped T W 72, indicating that it was manufactured
at the Twin Cities Ordnance Plant in Minneapolis, Minnesota (Frigiola 2002). Developed from the 223
Remington cartridge, the 5.56x45 mm Ball cartridge M193 was officially adopted by the U.S. Army in
1964 for the M16 rifle; a new version with a heavier bullet is now the standard round of the United States
and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Barnes 2006:17).
Three pieces of ammunition have not been dated: one centerfire cartridge case fragment and two
lead bullets. The cartridge case is from NE1, and has a 0.50 inch rim diameter, 0.425 inch case diameter,
and 1.2 inch (fragmentary) length. It appears to have a Berdan primer, which was widely used starting
in the early 1870s (International Ammunition Association 2006). Two fired lead bullets cannot be dated;
the one from NE4 is too fragmentary to identify. The other is from ES1; it is slightly warped from impact
but measures 0.42 to 0.43 inch in diameter and 0.61 inch long, and weighs 185 grains (12 grams). It has
two grease grooves and a concave base, and appears to be 44 caliber (Reign Clark, personal communication 2008).
Not shown on Table 49 are four artifacts related to ammunition. A 30 caliber machine gun belt
link from ES3 may date to the 1950s; it has an impressed J stamp that has not been identified. Three
amorphous pieces of lead slag from CA4 may be related to casting of lead ammunition. They weigh 16 g
(247 grains), 20 g (309 grains), and 78 g (1,204 grains), and contain embedded wood charcoal, pebbles,
and ash. The largest piece is 8.5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and 1 cm thick. The slag may have been produced
accidentally during the manufacture of lead balls or bullets, but this association cannot be made with
confidence.

Materials Recovered

Buttons and Bead
Five buttons and one bead were recovered, two collected from the surface during the survey and
four from the park collection. Two buttons are made of shell, one button and the bead are glass, one
button is china, and one button is metal. The shell buttons are in the park collections from CA5 and
NE4, measure 19 mm and 15 mm in diameter, and have two holes in a fisheye depression (Pool 1991:8).
The freshwater shell button industry in the United States started in 1888, peaked in popularity around
1900, and continued through World War I, when shell was replaced by plastic (Pool 1991:6). Shell buttons were used as utilitarian fasteners for shirts, undergarments, and childrenâs clothes (Pool 1991:7).
A white utilitarian china button was recovered during the survey of NE4. It is made of porcelain,
is 13 mm in diameter, and has two convex holes in an oval depression (Pool 1991:7-8). China buttons
reached peak popularity in the United States between 1850 and 1910 (Pool 1991:11).
One-half of a decorative black glass button was recovered from NW2 during the survey. It is 14 mm
in diameter and lacks a loop. The front is decorated with a pattern of raised dots. Pressed black glass
buttons were popular in the United States from 1870 to 1910 (Pool 1991:6).
The metal button was found in the park collection from CA7. It is a stud, made of an unidentified
material with a ferrous knob. The front is 17 mm in diameter. It cannot be dated.
One cut drawn glass bead is in the park collection from NE4. It is spherical, bright red, and measures
4 mm in diameter by 2.6 mm long.

RESEARCH FINDINGS

by Margaret Howard

The significance of the cultural resources of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site has been
officially recognized through listing in the National Register of Historic Places and designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. The potential of this multi-faceted site to increase knowledge of prehistoric
and historic lifeways in the region is widely appreciated. The current investigations, though limited to
surface inspection, shovel testing, and archival research, have yielded data that provide insights into
prehistoric and historic lifeways at Hueco Tanks. These findings are reviewed under the broad research
domains of chronology, settlement patterns, subsistence, procurement and trade, ritual practices, and
historic occupation. The research questions that were posed at the onset of this project are addressed,
along with new questions that emerged during these investigations.
Data substantiating the conclusions drawn here come primarily from five sections of the report:
Features, Structures, and Distributions; Materials Recovered; Historical Background; Rock Imagery;
and Appendix B, Radiocarbon Assays. In the interest of clarity, references to those sections are kept to
a minimum. Areas within Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site that are noted in this section are
depicted on Figure 27.

CHRONOLOGY
The record of human presence at Hueco Tanks is around 10,000 years long. Initially, it was imagined
that chronological information on this extensive record would come primarily from time-diagnostic
artifacts, radiocarbon assays, and archival research. The rich historic fabric of Hueco Tanks has yielded
additional sources of information on the timing of human presence: rock imagery styles, historic
inscriptions, and artifact densities in shovel tests. In conjunction, these data provide a more nuanced
view of the time and place of human activities at the Tanks (Table 50).
The oldest evidence of human presence at Hueco Tanks comes from the early Paleoindian period.
Eight Folsom points that date between ca. 9000 and 8200 B.C. (Haynes et al. 1992) have been found in
CA6, CA7, and NE1 by avocational archeologists and others over the years. Three of these points were
found in one section of a deep arroyo (Davis 1972b) where a Paleoindian component apparently is buried.
In the same general area where the Folsom points were found, the late Paleoindian period (8200 to 6000
B.C.) is minimally represented by an untyped lanceolate point and a possible Scottsbluff point from NE1.
Archaic occupations date from 6000 B.C. to A.D. 200, and are indicated by four types of evidence:
dart points, radiocarbon dates, Middle and Late Archaic Red Monochrome rock imagery, and diffuse
cultural deposits that lack ceramics (see Table 50). The inferred age of Red Monochrome rock imageryâca. 3000 B.C. to A.D. 450âis supported by recovery of Late Archaic dart points and a few Middle
Archaic dart points in all of the localities where this imagery was found.

Table 50. Locality Age Indicators

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Research Findings

Archaic presence is evidenced at almost three-fourths of the localities at Hueco Tanks. Dart points
identified to Archaic sub-periods by their stem forms (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004) allow for activities
within this 6,200 year period to be tracked. Contracting and parallel-stemmed Early Archaic (6000 to
4000/3000 B.C.) dart points were found in only five localities. Middle Archaic (4000/3000 to 1200 B.C.)
dart points with contracting stems or expanding stems and concave bases were found in eight localities.
By Late Archaic times (1200 B.C. to 200 A.D.), the number of occupied localities almost doubled, as
indicated by the presence of side- or corner-notched dart points with expanding stems and straight or
convex bases (see Table 50).
Archaic occupation apparently is represented by diffuse cultural deposits lacking ceramics in shovel
tests at seven localities; dart points were found in all of these localities except WS4 (see Table 50). In
WS2, the age of these deposits is substantiated by radiocarbon dates on charcoal from two shovel tests
(one of which produced an untyped dart point), which bracket identical spans of 10 B.C. to A.D. 140
near the end of the Late Archaic. Because the samples were taken from the upper part of a midden
deposit, occupation at WS2 probably extends further back into the Late Archaic.
Formative period (A.D. 200 to 1450) occupations occurred in all of the Hueco Tanks localities
except ES3, and are indicated by prehistoric ceramics, arrow points, radiocarbon dates, shovel test
data, and/or Jornada Style rock imagery. Phases within the Formative period are distinguished primarily by ceramic types, which have overlapping spans of production that do not coincide directly
with phase boundaries. In view of the predominant but not exclusive association of most types with
particular phases, they are used here to discern chronological variation among localities at Hueco
Tanks during the Formative period.
The Mesilla phase (A.D. 200 to 1000) is represented by El Paso Brown (A.D. 200/600 to 1000/1100),
Mimbres Black-on-white Style II (A.D. 880 to 1020), and Mimbres Black-on-white Style II/III (A.D. 970
to 1020) ceramics. A radiocarbon assay also dates the onset of occupation in NW2 to the late Mesilla
phase. Considering the 800-year span of this phase, representation of Mesilla components is modest
(see Table 50), indicated at less than half of the localities. The restrictive criteria for identifying El Paso
Brown ceramics under-represent Mesilla phase components at the survey level, however, because only
rim sherds from those pots are diagnostic of this type, while the rim, shoulder, and sometimes broader
areas of El Paso Bichrome and Polychrome pots identify those types at the level of the sherd.
The DoÃ±a Ana phase (A.D. 1000 to 1300) is represented by El Paso Bichrome (A.D. 800/1000 to
1100/1250), El Paso Polychrome Transitional variant (A.D. 1000/1100 to 1250), and Mimbres Blackon-white Style III (A.D. 1010 to 1130) pottery. In addition, 20 radiocarbon dates secure the occupation
span of Hueco Tanks Village (in NE2) between A.D. 1000 and 1300. A summed probability histogram
of those dates peaks between A.D. 1200 and 1300, placing primary occupation in the late DoÃ±a Ana
phase (Miller 2001a). Three more radiocarbon dates evidence this phase in two other localities; in CA5,
one corncob brackets most of the DoÃ±a Ana phase and a second dates to the late part of the phase. An
early DoÃ±a Ana phase date comes from the base of a fire-cracked rock feature in SB6. Overall, DoÃ±a Ana
components can be discerned at around half of the localities (see Table 50).
El Paso phase (A.D. 1300 to 1450) components are indicated at slightly less than half of the localities
(see Table 50) by El Paso Polychrome Classic variant sherds (A.D. 1250 to 1450), coming from vessels
with everted rims, thickened lips, and/or distinctive design elements (Miller 1995). A radiocarbon date
on a corncob from CA5 also falls in this phase. In light of its short time span and the single ceramic type
variant that represents it, El Paso phase presence at Hueco Tanks was considerable.
The combined DoÃ±a Ana/El Paso phases are abundantly represented in all but one of the localities
by El Paso Polychrome unspecified, Chupadero Black-on-white, Playas Red, and/or Ramos Polychrome

285

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

ceramics, which have spans of production that generally range from A.D. 1000/1200 to 1450, bracketing
the two phases. Jornada Style rock imagery was found at almost all of these localities (see Table 50), and
is thought to span a period between A.D. 1000 and 1450. It is not possible to discern whether either or
both phases are represented in these localities based on these indicators alone.
Historic native presence is evident at eight localities through rock imagery and radiocarbon dates
(see Table 50), and documented at Hueco Tanks in historic accounts. The greatest degree of temporal
resolution comes from written records. The earliest notes that in March 1692, an Apache captive led
Spanish troops to el zerro hueco, where they met other Apaches who said that place was their hunting
grounds. In December 1777, a Mescalero Apache emissary told Spanish authorities that bands from
the Sierra Blanca, Sacramento, and Organ Mountains were camped at Cerro Hueco. A conflict between
Kiowa Indians and Mexican troops in 1839 is thought to have taken place at Hueco Tanks, as details of
its location match a rockshelter in CA7.
Rock imagery provides most of the data that tie Native American activities during the historic
period to particular localities at Hueco Tanks. Pictographs identified stylistically as Mescalero Apache
that apparently were painted between the 1690s and late 1800s are in five localities. Rock imagery in CA7
depicts the 1839 siege, according to present-day Kiowa informants. Biographic Style pictographs in five
localities might have been painted in the late eighteenth and/or nineteenth centuries by Kiowa and/or
Comanche Indians who were in the area during that time.
Radiocarbon dates from the Historic Native period were obtained at two of the localities with rock
imagery, but calibration issues prevent them from obtaining a high degree of resolution. A corncob in
the rocks above NE2 dates between 1640 and 1820; Mescalero Apache and Biographic imagery are in
the vicinity. Charcoal that probably is from a ring midden in SB4 spans a period from 1650 to 1880, and
Biographic rock imagery in the vicinity suggests that the midden dates to the latter part of that span. In
conjunction, these accounts, dates, and images place Indian people at eight locations in Hueco Tanks
between the 1690s and the late 1800s.
The research potential of cultural components dating to the many time periods represented at
Hueco Tanks is dependent on the ability to isolate particular components horizontally or vertically so
that they can be studied individually. As the preceding discussion indicates, horizontal patterning is
distinctive and time-diagnostic data are sufficiently abundant to allow recognition of components in
localities (see Table 50). The potential for vertical isolation of components has been assessed through
data from 33 shovel tests dug during the current investigations, which encountered materials evidencing
a range of time periods and densities. Rockshelter deposits were not tested, but limited probing indicates that they are up to 50 cm thick.
In open areas, cultural deposits are ca. 70 cm thick on average, and range up to 1 m or more. The
ages of buried cultural components indicated by time-diagnostic artifacts are confirmed in some cases
by radiocarbon dates. Archaic (ceramic-free) components generally are buried. Formative artifacts also
were recovered at depth in some areas, but it is not clear whether they represent in situ buried components or materials worked down into the sandy sediments over time. The latter process would explain
the mixed contexts of time-diagnostic artifacts in a few tests. Historic artifacts primarily were recovered
at shallow depths. Evidence of stratification was found in one shovel test. In general, vertical distributions of artifacts indicate that cultural components incorporated into alluvial fan deposits at Hueco
Tanks preserve an interpretable record of prehistoric occupation, as substantiated by the intact buried
features found in excavations at Hueco Tanks Village (Kegley 1982).

Research Findings

SETTLEMENT PATTERNS
This review focuses on the timing and uses of particular areas of Hueco Tanks, as indicative of the
intensity of occupation in this alluvial fan setting over time. Regional settlement trends provide the
context for interpreting the patterns at Hueco Tanks.
Paleoindian occupation in the region is first evidenced by Folsom points, which are moderately
abundant in the Tularosa Basin to the north but less common in the Hueco Bolson. According to Amick
(1996), Folsom hunters wintered in the Rio Grande valley, and then exploited the Southern Plains grasslands during the summer and early fall. Intensive use of Tularosa Basin stone sources suggests that the
basin was a repeatedly occupied hunting territory, while a lesser number of points made of Edwards
chert from over 300 miles away indicate the extensive range of these groups.
Early Paleoindian sites in the Jornada Mogollon area typically are short-term residential camps,
positioned at locations offering views of the surrounding area and ready access to water. The Folsomage component at Hueco Tanks is in such a setting, and probably is a short-term winter camp like the
sites in the Tularosa Basin. The ground surface in the pass between North and East Mountains was level
in those times and could have been used as a game drive, while the rock hills would have offered excellent vantage for hunters (Davis 1972b).
Late Paleoindian occupations are rare in the Hueco Bolson (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Minimal evidence of this period was found at Hueco Tanks near the Folsom-era camp. People would have congregated
near water sources during the drying climatic conditions of that time (Carmichael 1986; Miller 2006).
While evidence of the Archaic period is not abundant across the region (Miller 2006), all three
sub-periods are represented at Hueco Tanks. The seasonally mobile hunting and gathering strategy
that groups practiced during this period (Lowry et al. 2003; Miller 2006; OâLaughlin 1980) apparently
favored Hueco Tanks, due to its abundant and diverse animal and plant life, and water sources. In the
region, sites dating to the Middle and Late Archaic are located in all environmental zones, but concentrated in the central Hueco Bolson (Mauldin et al. 1998; Miller 2007). Rockshelters typically have considerable Late Archaic cultural deposits (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
At Hueco Tanks, single Early Archaic dart points were found in five localities that are widely spaced
(Table 51). Middle Archaic presence is evident in a few more localities that are clustered in the Central
Area, and five points dating to this period were found in NW1. Middle and Late Archaic rock imagery is
most abundant on and near North Mountain. By Late Archaic times the number of occupied localities
doubled, and included all of the Central Area as well as a few nearby localities. Five to six Late Archaic
dart points were found in CA5, CA7, NW1, and NW2, indicating repeated or longer-term occupations.
The increase in numbers of Early (n = 5), Middle (n = 18) and Late Archaic (n = 48) dart points at
Hueco Tanks correlates to growth in regional Archaic populations (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Whalen
1994b). Brief visits to Hueco Tanks probably were made with increasing frequency during the Archaic
period, to procure the food, water, fuel, and other materials that were available in abundance.
Near the end of the Late Archaic period and probably earlier, intensive occupation occurred in WS2,
based on two terminal Late Archaic radiocarbon dates from the upper part of a midden stratum. Sixtythree small rock hearths clustered in this locality apparently date to the Middle or Late Archaic and
were used for cooking and heating, representing a large encampment or multiple smaller camps. Small
huts with brush superstructures might have been built in WS2, resembling the Middle Archaic huts on
an alluvial fan at Keystone Dam site 33 (OâLaughlin 1980), and/or the Late Archaic huts near multiple
(rock-free) hearths and an incipient midden at El Arenal, on the basin margin 8.5 miles southwest of
Hueco Tanks (Miller 2007).

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Research Findings

The Formative period saw a rapid succession of changes across the region. At the outset, Mesilla
phase occupations were widely distributed across the interior basin (Carmichael 1986; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004; Whalen 1977, 1978). A shift in settlement occurred in the late Mesilla phase, with an
increased degree of sedentism, more dependence on agriculture, greater use of features on alluvial fans,
and higher population densities (Mauldin et al. 1998; Miller 2007; OâLaughlin 1980; Whalen 1994b).
Hard (1983a) has proposed that late Mesilla phase groups planted agricultural fields on alluvial fans or
river terraces in the late spring, hunted and gathered in the central basin in the summer, and returned
to harvest the fields in the fall, while winter and spring camps were positioned in proximity to reliable
water sources.
At Hueco Tanks, representation of the Mesilla phase is modest, dropping slightly from Late Archaic
levels (see Table 50). The South Basin shows the most concentrated Mesilla phase presence, followed by
the Central Area, where CA2 produced the highest number of El Paso Brown ceramics of any locality
(see Table 51). The most intensive activity during the latter part of this phase was found in NW2, where
a radiocarbon date at the base of a midden deposit places the onset of intensive occupation in the late
Mesilla phase. If this midden was associated with structures, they may have resembled the shallow, circular Mesilla phase huts found 6.5 miles west-northwest of the Tanks at Turquoise Ridge (Whalen 1994a).
In the DoÃ±a Ana phase, occupations across the region were concentrated on alluvial fans (Miller
2005b, 2007), where sedentary agricultural hamlets were established near arable soils and reliable water
sources (Beckes et al. 1977; Carmichael 1990; Miller 2007). Hueco Tanks Village was such a site, comprised of a group of six freestanding rectangular structures in NE2, located between two patches of
Mimbres soil that have a higher water-holding capacity than other soils at the Tanks (Kegley 1982).
The greatest degree of sedentism at Hueco Tanks apparently occurred during the DoÃ±a Ana phase,
as indicated by midden deposits and artifact densities, and supported by regional settlement patterns. At
Hueco Tanks Village (actually a hamlet), radiocarbon dates on Houses 1 through 4 and 6 are generally
contemporaneous, so the structures may have been occupied simultaneously. Its 300-year span could
encompass as many as 10 generations, though occupation apparently was concentrated during the second half of that period. Superimposed floor levels in House 5 evidence the refurbishing and reoccupation that must have taken place at the Village over time, and relatively intensive and/or long-term use is
indicated by high artifact densities in the refuse deposits that typically fill structures dating to this phase,
including those at the Village (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Midden-stained sediments also indicate substantial use of NW2 during the DoÃ±a Ana phase. Intensive occupation represented by the midden that began developing in the late Mesilla phase apparently
continued into the DoÃ±a Ana phase, as indicated by El Paso Polychrome Transitional variant ceramics
(see Table 51). Nine small fire-cracked rock features spaced at moderate distances along the alluvial fan
channel that runs through the locality could date to one or both periods. Although the dense midden
deposit indicates that structures may have been built in NW2 during the DoÃ±a Ana phase, it seems
unlikely that agriculture was practiced there, as no patches of moist soil are located nearby. It has been
rumored that another prehistoric (DoÃ±a Ana?) village in the Central Area was destroyed when a dam
was built in the 1960s, but artifacts on the dam represent the entire Formative period (Roberts 2005a),
so its presence cannot be demonstrated.
Five other localities where DoÃ±a Ana phase ceramics were found also appear to have been occupied
intensively during that time, based on high densities of materials in shovel tests. In CA2, CA5, CA7, NE1,
and SB4, elevated quantities of debitage, fire-cracked rocks, and faunal remains (see Table 15) signify that
these localities saw a variety of activities including tool manufacture and sharpening, food preparation
and discard, and cooking and heating. Two corncobs dating to the DoÃ±a Ana phase also were found near

289

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

CA5, and apparently were brought from the Village, as no suitable field locations are nearby. Prehistoric
dams in NE1, NE2, NW2, CA5, and CA7, and an extensive water retention system in CA2 would have
supplied water to all but one of the seven localities that evidence intensive occupation during the DoÃ±a
Ana phase.
Wild plant processing apparently took place in SB5 and SB6 during the DoÃ±a Ana phase. In SB6,
the base of a large fire-cracked rock feature dates to the early DoÃ±a Ana phase; this feature is in a cluster
of 12 similar features that also may date to that phase, and appear to represent leaf succulent roasting
pits (see below). Nearby in SB5, 6 small fire-cracked rock features and 7 large ones date generally to the
Formative period, and three of them were used during the DoÃ±a Ana/El Paso phase, based on artifacts
observed within 1 m. The close spacing of these small features could represent a camp, while the large
ones may be roasting pits. A Mimbres Black-on-white Style III sherd confirms use of the locality during
the DoÃ±a Ana phase.
Overall, human populations were highest at Hueco Tanks during the DoÃ±a Ana period. The areas that
were most intensively occupied were NE2 and NW2, with less intensive occupations in CA2, CA5, CA7,
NE1, and SB4. Plants apparently were cultivated in fields near NE2, while intensive processing of leaf
succulents was practiced in SB5 and SB6. Five other localities were used non-intensively (see Table 51).
During the subsequent El Paso phase, settlement patterns in the region shifted dramatically; there
was a marked decline in occupations on alluvial fans, while occupations near playas peaked (Brook
1971; Miller 2005b; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The pueblos established in those areas were not occupied year round, as many have relatively small refuse middens given the capacity of their structures
(Beckett and Wiseman 1979). Mauldin (1986) has proposed that agriculture was the main activity at
such primary habitation sites, beginning with spring planting. After the summer rains began, pueblos
would have been mostly abandoned in favor of secondary habitation sites near temporary water sources,
occupied briefly by small groups foraging for seasonally available plants and animals. In the fall, groups
would have aggregated at primary habitation sites to harvest crops, and relied on stored foods through
the winter.
Within 8 miles of Hueco Tanks, at least three pueblos were built near playas on the distal alluvial
fan during the El Paso phase. Six miles to the northwest, Hot Well had up to 100 rooms; 7 miles to the
west-northwest, Three Lakes probably had 10 to 20 rooms. Eight miles to the south, 25 to 50 rooms were
built at Sabina Mountain #2. El Paso phase populations in the vicinity of Hueco Tanks probably were
concentrated in these villages. Resources that were scarce or unavailable near the pueblos were obtained
during forays and seasonal rounds to other locations, including Hueco Tanks. One material likely to
have been collected from the Tanks is wood for fuel and structures, which would have been depleted
rapidly in areas around pueblos. The cottonwood roof beams in Room 17 at Hot Well pueblo might
have been carried from Hueco Tanks, the nearest present-day location where those trees grow (Lowry
2005; OâLaughlin 2005a).
El Paso phase presence at Hueco Tanks is evidenced by El Paso Polychrome Classic variant sherds at
12 localities, none of which produced more than four of these distinctive sherds. A corncob from near
CA5 that dates to this period apparently represents foodstuffs brought by groups visiting the Tanks.
Five of the localities used during the El Paso phase are in the South Basin, and the rest are scattered (see
Table 51). Five of these localities had been intensively occupied during the preceding DoÃ±a Ana phase,
and the remainder have low density cultural deposits. Longer-term El Paso phase occupation might
have occurred at NW1, where extensive midden deposits date generally to the Formative period, and
three El Paso Polychrome Classic sherds were found on the surface. Presence of El Paso Polychrome
Classic sherds in SB5 and SB6 may indicate that succulent plants continued to be processed in the large

290

Research Findings

roasting pits in those localities, first used during the DoÃ±a Ana phase. Overall, the data from Hueco
Tanks coincide with regional patterns indicating low-level use of alluvial fan settings during the El Paso
phase, for procurement of seasonal plants and other resources in short supply near larger settlements.
Region-wide depopulation of the southern Southwest by agricultural groups after A.D. 1450 (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004) is surmised through lack of archeological evidence at most or all of the areas
that had been occupied previously, including Hueco Tanks. The next indications of human presence
at the Tanks date from the late seventeenth through the late nineteenth century, when highly mobile
Apache bands roamed the region, making short-term camps on hilltops with commanding views of
surrounding areas (Seymour 2004). Offering vantage as well as water, Hueco Tanks attracted repeated
intermittent use by native groups during this time, as indicated by Mescalero Apache style pictographs
concentrated around the pass between North and East Mountains, probably painted between the 1690s
and the late 1800s. Kiowa warriors apparently took cover in a cave in CA7 during a siege in 1839. In the
late eighteenth and/or nineteenth centuries, Kiowa and/or Comanche Indians stopping by the Tanks
may have painted Biographic Style pictographs in CA1, CA4, CA7, NE2, and SB4. During this time,
native people also guided military scouts and travelers along a trail that led through Hueco Tanks to a
series of water sources to the east, which probably had been used for centuries before Europeans and
Americans arrived in the region.
Two significant natural features at Hueco Tanks influenced use of particular areas over time: rockshelters and water sources. The 163 rockshelters near the base of the rock hills are concentrated around
East Mountain, West Mountain, and North Mountain, with only 14 on East Spur. Densities of rockshelters are roughly equivalent along the margins of the basins between the hills. Areas without rockshelters
saw limited use, as reflected by non-intensive occupations in ES1, ES2, and ES3 (see Table 51).
Prehistoric occupation of most or all of the low-elevation rockshelters at Hueco Tanks seems likely,
as they offer shelter from the elements and moderate temperatures. Abundant artifacts in the localities
that adjoin them also testify to their use. Intensive occupation is limited to one-fourth of the shelters, however, as indicated by midden-stained sediments in or near them. Bedrock mortars were found
within or near one-fourth of the rockshelters. Almost all of the shelters contain rock imagery, and
human graves have been found in a few of them. Limited testing in a few shelters has recovered ceramics
spanning the Formative period, chipped and ground stone artifacts, cordage, fabric, food remains, and
bone and wooden artifacts (Davis 1972b, 1973). Basket rim and net fragments have been collected from
rockshelter floors.
The age of rockshelter deposits at the Tanks was not assessed directly during the current investigations. Shelters in the region typically contain Late Archaic cultural deposits (Miller and Kenmotsu
2004). At Hueco Tanks, 15 percent of the rockshelters are associated with bedrock mortars but lack midden deposits, and may have been occupied during the Archaic period and/or early Mesilla phase, when
overall population densities were relatively low. Midden deposits in 26 percent of the shelters could
indicate their use during the late Mesilla or DoÃ±a Ana phases, when the Tanks were intensively occupied.
Pictographs in 44 percent of the shelters are primarily Jornada Style images, and it seems likely that most
were painted during the DoÃ±a Ana phase, when Hueco Tanks supported the greatest number of people.
Water sources also affected the location and intensity of activities at Hueco Tanks. Many natural
chutes and cracks on the rock hills convey water to ground level. Small dams were built at the base of at
least 10 of these conduits in prehistoric times, and many more dams may be present. The known dams
are in seven localities, six of which were intensively occupied during the DoÃ±a Ana phase (see Table 51).
Ceramics from test excavations in sheltered parts of a water retention system originating high on the
rock hill above CA2 show that it was used throughout the Formative period, but primarily during the

291

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

DoÃ±a Ana and possibly El Paso phases (Davis 1972b, c).
Activities within 10 m of ground-level dams were minimal, as indicated by low numbers of bedrock
grinding features and midden-stained sediments in their immediate vicinity. Water apparently was
transported some distance to food preparation and living areas from even the most convenient sources.
Midden-stained sediments might have been washed away by flow over these dams during high rainfall
events, however, and also would have made areas in their vicinity less desirable for occupation.
Three large prehistoric retention basins at the Tanks were major water sources when filled to capacity by seasonal rains. Two huecos in the water retention system above CA2 held a maximum of 780 gallons, while the cavern in that system is estimated to hold at least 10,000 gallons. The pool in CA7 is said
to hold at least 13,000 gallons. All three basins are sheltered by rock, so their evaporative loss is minimal.
Assuming personal use of 2 gallons per day for consumption, food preparation, and sanitation, the huecos when filled held 390 person-days of water, the cavern would have held 5,000 daily water rations, and
the CA7 basin could retain up to 6,500 person-days of water. The capacity of these three basins alone,
along with the purity of the water and its availability during periods when open-air sources had gone
dry, made Hueco Tanks highly attractive, especially during times of drought. Impounded water sources
like these allowed greater numbers of people to gather at places like Hueco Tanks for longer periods of
time than could have been supported by natural sources alone (Crown 1987).
The comparatively abundant water of Hueco Tanks almost certainly was transported to other settlements and possibly fields. Possible water transport during the DoÃ±a Ana/El Paso phases was evident at
NW4, an isolated location 200 m from the rock hills where 406 sherds represent an El Paso Polychrome
jar and an untyped brownware vessel. These pots likely were dropped while being carried on a trail (Kludt
et al. 2007) that led from the Tanks to the northwest, toward the Hot Well and Three Lakes pueblos.

SUBSISTENCE
Information on prehistoric subsistence at Hueco Tanks comes from faunal and floral remains, and
food-processing features and tools. The greatest body of data are from Hueco Tanks Village and date
to the DoÃ±a Ana phase, while the age of the remaining data is not well known. Given this limitation,
subsistence at Hueco Tanks is interpreted in the context of regional patterns.
In early Paleoindian times, Bison antiquus remains found at Folsom sites across the region indicate
that it was a key resource, but a wide range of other animals probably were consumed as well (Amick
1996). The demise of bison in the late Paleoindian period prompted a shift to a broader subsistence base
(Miller 2006). The Archaic diet was based on large and small animals and seasonally available plants
(Beckett 1979; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The earliest cultivated corn, amaranth, and tobacco date
to the beginning of the Late Archaic period, and beans appeared several centuries later (Bohrer 2007;
Lentz 2006; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Tagg 1996). Cultivated plants were a very small part of the Late
Archaic diet, however; bulk processing of leaf succulents like agave and sotol is first evidenced near the
end of the Late Archaic period (Miller 2007; OâLaughlin 1980). Faunal remains from Late Archaic sites
consist primarily of rabbit bones (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
In the Formative period, the Mesilla phase diet consisted primarily of wild plant foods and small
amounts of cultivated plants; processing of leaf succulents continued. Agricultural dependence increased
significantly after A.D. 1150 in the late DoÃ±a Ana phase, coupled with intensified exploitation of succulents and other wild plants (Miller 2005b; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; OâLaughlin 2001). The highest
level of agricultural dependence occurred during the El Paso phase, as wild plant processing fell to a

292

Research Findings

minimum (Miller 2005b; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; OâLaughlin 2005a). Meat comprised a minor part
of the Formative diet and centered on jackrabbits and cottontails, with very few large animals (Miller
1989, 2007; OâLaughlin 2005b; Peterson 2001; Shafer et al. 1999). During the early historic period,
Apache groups subsisted primarily by hunting, but also roasted agave in rock-lined pits (Bandelier 1890;
Forbes 1959; Miller 2001b; Sale 1991).
At Hueco Tanks Village, faunal remains from the late DoÃ±a Ana phase occupation were identified but not quantified (Davidson 1982). Jackrabbit and cottontail dominate the sample (Kegley 1982).
Black bear, bison, softshell turtle, and desert box turtle remains found at the Village are not represented
in contemporary samples from Gobernadora, Ojasen, or Meyer Pithouse Village (Peterson 2001; Shafer
et al. 1999). Three of these species come from non-desert habitats; black bears typically occupy wooded
mountainous areas and bison live on open prairies (Davis and Schmidly 1994), while softshell turtles are
native to riverine areas (Worthington 1996a). Greater species diversity in the Village fauna may indicate
that groups based at the Tanks traveled farther or to different areas on hunting forays than groups at
other DoÃ±a Ana phase sites. Bear might have been taken in the Hueco Mountains 1 mile to the east, and
bison could have inhabited the Diablo Plateau, located 5 to 6 miles east of the Tanks. The nearest water
source where softshell turtle could have been obtained is the Rio Grande, located 23 miles southwest
of Hueco Tanks. From the current investigations, the small sample of faunal remains is undated, and
consists primarily of cottontail and jackrabbit. A few deer, woodrat, turtle, and snake bones are taxa that
also are represented at Hueco Tanks Village.
Wild plant consumption at Hueco Tanks Village is evidenced by seeds from cactus, datil yucca,
and pigweed or goosefoot. Cactus and yucca seeds typically are byproducts of processing fruit, while
the pigweed/goosefoot seeds could represent consumption of greens and seeds, or incidental burning
(OâLaughlin 2001). During the current investigations, three charred Chenopodium seeds and two fragments were recovered from CA5 (see Appendix C). This wild plant produces large quantities of seeds in
the late summer and fall, which are volumetrically equivalent to corn in terms of calories, but have more
protein and fat (Asch and Asch 1978). Chenopod/amaranth was abundant in macrobotanical samples
from early and late Mesilla phase occupations at Turquoise Ridge (Whalen 1994). In the central Hueco
Bolson, Chenopodium processing is evidenced by over 50 charred and broken seeds recovered from the
floor of an early Mesilla phase pithouse (Leach, Holloway, and Almarez 1996).
Wild plant seeds likely were processed in the 313 bedrock mortars found at low elevations on the
rock hills at Hueco Tanks. Mortars are concentrated in and near the Central Area, and on the northeast
and northwest sides of the Tanks (see Table 51). Most occur in groups; the largest clusters in CA4, CA5,
CA7, and NE2 contain from 14 to 40 mortars. These bedrock receptacles probably were used to crush
and grind wild plant foods like nuts and seed pods, and possibly other substances (Adams 1998; Church
et al. 2009). The abundance, spacing, and depth of the bedrock mortars at Hueco Tanks indicate that wild
plant processing was a common and possible communal prehistoric activity. One plant that probably was
processed is mesquite; its pods and beans were ground in stone and wooden mortars by native groups
across the American Southwest and northern Mexico (Adams 1998; Bell and Castetter 1937). Mesquite
pods mature in the late summer and fall, and are high in protein, sugar, calcium, and iron (Tull 1987).
Most of the bedrock mortars at the Tanks are associated with rockshelters; 72 percent of them are
located within 10 m of a shelter. Only 16 percent of them are located within 10 m of midden-stained
sediments, however. In conjunction, these data suggest that bedrock mortar use occurred primarily during the Archaic period and/or early Mesilla phase, when overall population densities were relatively low.
Leaf succulents are another type of wild plant that probably was consumed in prehistoric times
(OâLaughlin 2001). Unlike edible seeds, the hearts of these plants are indigestible until they have been

293

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

roasted in earth ovens for 36 to 48 hours (Dering 1999; Tull 1987). Charred remains of agave, sotol,
and yucca are rare on sites in the southern Jornada Mogollon area, however. A few specimens have
been recovered from fire-cracked rock features on Otero Mesa and Castner Range (Dering 2002; Hard
1983b), and in samples from pithouses at the DoÃ±a Ana phase Gobernadora and Ojasen sites (Shafer et
al. 1999).
Large fire-cracked rock features like the 30 visible on the surface at Hueco Tanks are thought to be
leaf succulent roasting pits. Features greater than 1.5 m in diameter were found in seven localities but
are most numerous in SB5, SB6, and outside the cluster of small features in WS2. SB5 and SB6 are situated in and near a present-day agave patch in an area of moist Mimbres soils adjoining a major alluvial
fan channel. The large fire-cracked rock features are composed primarily of limestone, which retains
heat longer than porphyritic syenite. Two outsized flakes recovered near large fire-cracked rock features
in SB6 resemble expedient knives found on prehistoric agave fields and near agave roasting pits across
the American Southwest, that probably were used to sever the spiny leaves from the hearts of these
plants (Fish et al. 1992; Hines et al. 1994).
Based on the age of ceramics within 1 m of them, two of the possible roasting pits in SB5 and three
in SB6 date to the DoÃ±a Ana/El Paso phases, and a radiocarbon date places another feature at SB6 in the
early DoÃ±a Ana phase. Ceramics on the surface of these localities indicate their use during both DoÃ±a
Ana and El Paso phases (see Table 51). Although intensive leaf succulent processing surely occurred
during the DoÃ±a Ana phase, it apparently persisted into the El Paso phase at Hueco Tanks, though less
common at other sites in the region (cf. Miller 2005b; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Succulent plant
roasting during the early historic period is evidenced by the possible ring midden in SB4, based on
its size, radiocarbon date, and the subsistence practices of Mescalero Apache Indians during that time
(Opler and Opler 1950).
Cultivated plant remains have been found in multiple locations at Hueco Tanks. Hueco Tanks Village yielded four corn kernels and one bean from widespread contexts, indicating that these plants
were common. Miller (1997) calculated a maize ubiquity of 60 percent for the Village, finding corn in
three of five flotation samples. Four dated corncobs provide additional information on the period when
agriculture was practiced at Hueco Tanks. Three are from a packrat midden in CA5; one spans most
of the DoÃ±a Ana phase, another dates to the late DoÃ±a Ana phase, and a third brackets most of the El
Paso phase. Packrats build middens primarily of materials obtained within 30 to 50 m of their dens,
but up to 38 percent can come from greater distances (Vaughan 1990; Finley 1990). Because moist soils
suitable for agriculture are located over 800 m from this packrat midden, it seems unlikely that a field
was nearby; the cobs apparently were foodstuffs carried into the area during the DoÃ±a Ana and El Paso
phases. The fourth corncob comes from the rocks above NE2, and dates between 1640 and 1820, representing native consumption of corn that might have been obtained through raiding.
Evidence of agriculture at Hueco Tanks appears to date almost entirely to the DoÃ±a Ana phase,
when two patches of moist soil near Hueco Tanks Village probably were cultivated. The smaller area of
Mimbres soil covers 11 acres, and the larger one encompasses 124 acres (Jaco 1971; see Figure 6). The
distance of intensive Mesilla phase occupations from these areas suggests that plants were not cultivated
at Hueco Tanks during that phase. Moist soils at the Tanks apparently were not sufficiently extensive for
agriculture during the El Paso phase, which was practiced on a larger scale. Three El Paso phase pueblos
near Hueco TanksâHot Well, Three Lakes, and Sabina Mountain #2âare positioned near playa margins
where broad areas of soils that retain subsurface moisture are suitable for fields (Kenmotsu et al. 2008).
Although plant cultivation at Hueco Tanks could have been supported by irrigation, no diversion
structures were found that would have directed water from natural cracks and ponds in the rock hills to

294

Research Findings

the suspected field locations. In fact, no irrigation canals or channels have been identified conclusively
in the region (Miller et al. 2009). Pot irrigation could have been practiced at the Tanks (Doolittle 2000;
Kenmotsu et al. 2008; Miller et al. 2009) through use of ceramic vessels to transport water caught behind
prehistoric dams at four locations on the hills overlooking the Village, and from the large retention
basin 540 m away in CA7.
The forms of metates at Hueco Tanks and elsewhere are generally considered to indicate the technologies that were used to process certain types of foods (Adams 1999). Eighteen metates worn into
bedrock in CA1, CA5, NE2, and NW2 lack basins, and would have been suitable for producing flour
from soaked kernels and/or seeds including corn, which are easily confined on flat, rimless surfaces
(Adams 1999). At Hueco Tanks Village, flat metates outnumber basin metates two to one (Kegley 1982).
In the other localities, eight fragments come from basin metates, while three flat metates/fragments were
found in CA2, WS2, and WS3. The preponderance of flat metates in the DoÃ±a Ana phase component
at the Village, along with experimental studies (Adams 1999), suggest that they may have been used for
processing soaked corn and/or beans. Complete manos from the Village and the localities are all less
than 15 cm long, however, a size considered by Hard, Mauldin, and Raymond (1996) to be indicative of
a low level of maize processing.

PROCUREMENT AND TRADE
Local and nonlocal artifacts shed light on the territories and relationships of prehistoric people at
Hueco Tanks. Artifacts made of local materials represent the extent of group ranges and trade relationships within the southern Jornada Mogollon area, while items from outlying regions indicate the direction and magnitude of interregional trade networks.
Procurement and trade patterns throughout the entire span of occupation of Hueco Tanks can be
discerned through debitage, which is not well dated but comprises two-thirds of the prehistoric artifacts
from the current investigations. Dated ceramics and projectile points provide a greater degree of resolution on the timing of these patterns.
Among the 2,418 chipped stone artifacts from the current investigations, locally available chert makes
up 58 percent of the debitage, and has the highest representation in the tools and cores. Because chert
tool percentages substantially exceed the percentage of chert debitage, some of these tools probably were
brought to Hueco Tanks in partly or fully finished form. A high percentage of decorticate debitage also
shows that chert was brought to Hueco Tanks as blanks rather than unmodified nodules. Chert outcrops
have been located with a 5 to 7 mile radius of Hueco Tanks (Lukowski et al. 1999; Martin and Sommer
1974), and use of these sources is evidenced at nearby sites like El Arenal and Tres Casitas (Miller 2007).
Quartzite comprises 32 percent of the debitage and 38 percent of the cores. Quartzite is underrepresented in the dart and arrow points, and apparently was too coarse-grained for projectiles. The relative
abundance of quartzite in the debitage and cores suggests that a source area is near Hueco Tanks. The
nearest reported materials of this type are silicified Bliss Formation sandstones in the Hueco Mountains,
12 miles south of Hueco Tanks (Whalen 1994), and secondary deposits in ancestral Rio Grande gravels
in the Hueco Bolson (Church et al. 1996; Mauldin et al. 1998), ca. 15 miles from the Tanks.
Obsidian was recovered from 18 localities and constitutes 4 percent of the debitage. Its proportion
is inflated because every obsidian specimen seen during the current investigations was collected, as at
first this stone was mistakenly thought to be nonlocal. Obsidian tools, particularly arrow points, are
substantially overrepresented in comparison to obsidian debitage, and probably were brought to Hueco

295

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Tanks in finished form. Over half of the obsidian debitage retains cortex reflecting its river gravel origin,
and the small flakes represent the size of those nodules. Twenty-one obsidian artifacts were submitted
for X-ray fluorescence analysis (Shackley 2003, 2006); 19 were identified as Cerro Toledo or Mount Taylor obsidians, which occur as small nodules in ancestral Rio Grande gravels (Church 2000; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2004), ca. 15 miles from the Tanks. An obsidian cruciform from NE1 also is made of Mount
Taylor obsidian. One piece of debitage from SB6 is unassigned but has trace element proportions similar
to sources in northeast Chihuahua, Mexico (Shackley 2003).
Among the 95 projectile points that can be dated to particular periods, chert is the only material that
is sufficiently abundant to track over time. Of the four Folsom points from the Tanks that are available for
examination, two are made of Edwards chert from distant sources to the east and north, representing the
large territories of Paleoindian groups (Amick 1996). Use of local chert increased modestly but steadily
in the Middle and Late Archaic dart points through Formative arrow points. These finding differ from
material usage in a much larger sample of projectile points from Fort Bliss, in which obsidian and Rancheria chert use increased in the Late Archaic and Early Formative periods (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Among the ground stone tools at Hueco Tanks, metates are predominantly made of porphyritic
syenite, which comprises almost half of the 11 metates/fragments from the current investigations.
Metates from Hueco Tanks Village also were mostly syenite, except two made of limestone (Kegley
1982). Porphyritic syenite is widely represented in ground stone tool assemblages at sites across the
eastern Hueco Bolson, apparently obtained from Hueco Tanks, Cerro Alto, and/or a few other igneous
outcrops (Miller et al. 2009). The 16 manos/fragments from the current investigations are made of stone
from more distant sources; over half are sandstone and ca. one-third are quartzite, available at distances
of ca. 12 to 24 miles. Two pestle fragments also are sandstone, and one large pestle is made of limestone
available within 1 to 3 miles of Hueco Tanks.
Ceramics primarily are local El Paso Brownwares, which comprise 80 percent of the sample from
the current investigations and 95 percent of the sherds from Hueco Tanks Village. Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of 25 El Paso Brownware sherds (5 from the Village and the rest from
12 other localities) assigned 18 of them to three production areas in or near the Hueco Bolson. One
Bichrome sherd and seven Polychrome sherds are in the Hueco East 1 group, associated with sites along
the eastern margin of the Hueco Bolson (Miller 2007). El Paso Brownware ceramics probably were
not produced at Hueco Tanks, however, as clay suitable for pottery making is not available nearby. Ten
other El Paso Brownware sherds (including Brown, Polychrome Transitional, and Polychrome Classic)
are in the Hueco West Basin 1 and Hueco West Fan groups, associated with sites on the west margins
of the Hueco Bolson and southern Tularosa Basin. The remaining seven sherds are assigned to North, a
poorly defined group that probably encompasses multiple production areas in and around the northern
Tularosa Basin (Miller 2007; Miller and Burt 2007). While the widespread sources of these ceramics
could indicate the range of groups at Hueco Tanks, they are more likely to evidence trade within the
region, as Formative period groups apparently had fairly small ranges (see above).
Nonlocal ceramics are the primary source of information on contacts outside the region during the
Formative period. Chupadero Black-on-white (A.D. 1050 to 1500s) sherds comprise the vast majority,
making up 73 percent of the nonlocal ceramics from the current investigations and 83 percent of nonlocal ceramics from Hueco Tanks Village. Source analyses on three Chupadero Black-on-white sherds
collected at Hueco Tanks by others found that two of them come from the upper Rio Bonito drainage
in the Sierra Blanca region of south central New Mexico, the southernmost of two production areas for
this well-made pottery (Clark 2006; Creel, Clark, and Neff 2002). Chupadero ceramics might have been
obtained through trade due to the need or preference for their dominant vessel form, a narrow-necked
jar suitable for transporting liquids (Hayes et al. 1981; Smiley 1979).
296

Research Findings

Mimbres Black-on-white pottery (A.D. 750 to 1130) makes up 7 percent of the nonlocal ceramics
from the current investigations and 4 percent of the nonlocal sherds from Hueco Tanks Village. INAA
on 16 Mimbres Black-on-white sherds from the Village assigns them to five production areas in southwestern New Mexico (Speakman 2008). Eight sherds originated along the Rio Grande valley from Las
Cruces to north of Hatch, seven come from the middle to upper Mimbres River valley, and one sherd
is broadly affiliated with the Mimbres area. The four compositional groups represented in 12 Mimbres
Black-on-white Style III sherds indicate that during the brief production period of this style (A.D. 1010
to 1130) in the early DoÃ±a Ana phase, an interregional trade network brought ceramics from most of
the Mimbres cultural area to Hueco Tanks. The well-made and finely decorated Mimbres bowls could
have been obtained for aesthetic as well as functional reasons (Smiley 1979).
Playas Red (A.D. 1200 to early 1500s) comprises 7 percent of the nonlocal pottery from the current
investigations and 8 percent of nonlocal ceramics from Hueco Tanks Village. Initially thought to have
been produced solely in northern Mexico, INAA has evidenced Playas manufacturing locales in the
Mimbres and upper Gila areas, and widespread manufacture and movement of vessels throughout the
southern Southwest (Creel 1999; Creel, Williams, Neff, and Glascock 2002). In the vicinity of Hueco
Tanks, Playas Red may have been produced at Hot Well pueblo (Creel 1999), and local manufacture
also is indicated in samples from the western Hueco Bolson (Shafer et al. 2001). Of the four Playas Red
sherds from Hueco Tanks submitted for INAA, three are identified to Speakmanâs Playas Red compositional group, and presumably are from Mexico; the fourth apparently was made in the Mimbres region.
Provenance of the remaining nonlocal ceramics from Hueco Tanks is known generally but unconfirmed by source analyses. Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta (A.D. 1150 to early 1300s) comprises 8 percent of the nonlocal sherds from the current investigations and 2 percent of the nonlocal ceramics from
Hueco Tanks Village. It was made in the Sierra Blanca region of south central New Mexico (Stewart
1983) and widely traded into the Mimbres and Jornada Mogollon areas, and northern Mexico (Di Peso
et al. 1974a).
White Mountain Redware includes St. Johns Black-on-red/Polychrome (A.D. 1175 to 1300) and
Wingate Black-on-red (A.D. 1050 to 1200), types that are difficult to distinguish on sherds. These
ceramics comprise less than 1 percent of the nonlocal sherds from Hueco Tanks Village; the single sherd
from the current investigations was made into a pendant. The highest frequencies of these types are in
west-central New Mexico, where they were manufactured (Carlson 1970). White Mountain Redware
is widely distributed; St. Johns Black-on-Red/Polychrome has been found from Mesa Verde to Casas
Grandes (Gladwin and Gladwin 1931).
From northern Mexico, Chihuahuan ceramics dating between A.D. 1200 and 1500 were recovered
at Hueco Tanks Village in somewhat higher numbers than reported by Kegley (1982), consisting of Villa
Ahumada Polychrome (Myles Miller, personal communication 2008) and Ramos Polychrome, the latter
also represented by a few sherds from the current investigations. Small numbers of Chihuahuan corrugated ceramics also were recovered during both investigations. This pottery probably was produced in
the Casas Grandes valley (Di Peso et al. 1974b; Sayles 1936), although secondary production of Ramos
Polychrome in southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico recently has come to light (Fish and
Fish 1999; Skibo et al. 2002). Ramos Polychrome is one of the most broadly traded types from northern
Mexico; Villa Ahumada and Chihuahuan corrugated wares were not distributed as widely (Di Peso et
al. 1974b).
Proportions and ages of nonlocal ceramics at Hueco Tanks indicate that ceramic trade was initiated with the Mimbres area in the late Mesilla phase, expanded to include substantial exchange with
the Sierra Blanca area during the DoÃ±a Ana and El Paso phases, and was augmented around A.D. 1200

297

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

by minor trade with northern Mexico. The primary product exported from the region apparently was
El Paso Polychrome pottery, which was distributed as far as the La Junta area on the Rio Grande to
the southeast (Kenmotsu 2006), Casas Grandes to the south (Burgett 2007; Kelley 2000), Joyce Well in
southwestern New Mexico (Skibo et al 2002), northwest to the Mimbres area (Creel 1998), north to the
southern Sierra Blanca and Roswell areas (Clark 2006; Speth 2004), and northeast to the South Plains
(Collins 1968; Creel, Clark, and Neff 2002). These pots also could have served as containers to transport
roasted agave (Kelley 2000), salt, or other perishable products that would not be evident in the archeological record.
A few shell artifacts have been found at Hueco Tanks; items made of freshwater shell represent transport within the region, while marine shell artifacts were obtained through an interregional trade network that stretched from Casas Grandes to central Arizona (Bradley 1999; Hard, Patterson, and Tennis
1996). The DoÃ±a Ana phase occupation at Hueco Tanks Village yielded a few shell beads and fragments
made of Olivella, a genus that is native to the Gulf of California and Pacific coast (Lowry 2005:203;
Southward 1979:102). Artifacts made of freshwater shell (probably mussel from the Rio Grande) are
more numerous, consisting of a disk bead and a small pendant from the Village, and disk beads and a
perforated mussel shell from the current investigations.
The few rare stones recovered at Hueco Tanks probably were obtained through trade networks
within in the southern Jornada Mogollon area. Hueco Tanks Village produced four unmodified turquoise fragments and three quartz specimens. Although prehistoric turquoise sources are distributed
across the southwestern United States and northern Mexico (Harbottle and Weigand 1992; Mathien
2001), this precious stone is available 37 miles north of Hueco Tanks in the Jarilla Mountains, and was
mined in prehistoric times (Beckes et al. 1977; Bentley 1993; Carmichael 1986; Lowry 2005; Schmidt
and Craddock 1964). A quartz crystal and two other quartz fragments could have been obtained from
nearby Rio Grande gravels (Church et al. 1996). Hematite, limonite, and kaolinite nodules were found
in Hueco Tanks Village and CA2; the nearest sources of these soft mineral pigments are in the Organ and
Jarilla Mountains, 30 to 37 miles from Hueco Tanks (Miller and Graves 2009). The few fossils found at
Hueco Tanks almost certainly were collected within a short distance from limestone formations in the
Hueco Mountains.
In sum, almost all of the chipped and ground stone tools, and most of the ceramics at Hueco Tanks
were made of materials available in and near the Hueco Bolson. Freshwater shell, fossil, turquoise, and
pigment also could be obtained within a few days travel or through regional exchange networks. Trade
with regions to the north and northwest occurred during the DoÃ±a Ana and El Paso phases, as evidenced
by nonlocal ceramics. Minor interaction with Mexico during the DoÃ±a Ana phase is represented by
small numbers of painted ceramics and shell ornaments. The high level of participation in interregional
exchange networks evident on El Paso phase sites across the region (Hard, Patterson, and Tennis 1996;
Lehmer 1948) is not seen at Hueco Tanks, reinforcing other indications that occupation during that
period was non-intensive.

RITUAL PRACTICES
Through ritual practices people interact with supernatural forces, within their framework of beliefs
about how the natural and spiritual worlds operate. Ritual acts are conducted in the context of sacred
landscapes comprised of places that have symbolic value, including the sites where rites are conducted
as well as trails used on pilgrimages to and from them (Arsenault 2004). Connections between people
and sacred landscapes are maintained and reaffirmed through repeated rituals and ceremonies (Klaasen
298

Research Findings

1998; TaÃ§on 1990), which may leave tangible evidence that can be discerned in the archeological record
(VanPool et al. 2006).
Jornada Mogollon people probably adhered to beliefs about sacred landscapes that were widely held
by many North American Indian people, including traditional Plains cultures. These groups believed
that the entire landscape was charged with spiritual power, concentrated in unusual or outstanding
landscape features that were thought to have been created under supernatural circumstances. Mountains, unique rock formations, overlooks, caves, springs, and other such extraordinary landscape elements were believed to connect individuals with the cosmic framework that gives life meaning (Feld and
Basso 1996). Hueco Tanks embodies all of these unique landscape elements, and clearly was a focal point
in the prehistoric sacred landscape of the eastern Hueco Bolson.
The most abundant evidence of ritual practices at Hueco Tanks is rock imagery, consisting of over
3,000 images. The earliest pictographs date to the Middle and Late Archaic, but the vast majority are Jornada Style figures, most of which are thought to date to the DoÃ±a Ana phase when the greatest numbers of
persons lived at the Tanks. Through analogy to the belief systems of native groups in the region, a number
of these images are believed to symbolize petitions for rain. Many of the rituals practiced by native groups
in the American Southwest relate to water and its rejuvenation (Schaafsma 1980a). Water is thought to
emerge from the underworld through springs; people also come from the underworld and return there
when they die. Springs are openings between this world and the underworld, and appropriate places for
prayer (Phillips et al. 2006). The similarity of Jornada Style imagery to elements and motifs in Mimbres, Pueblo IV, Mesoamerican, and Casas Grandes iconography suggests that this ideology was shared
across a wide geographic area (Brody 1991; Di Peso 1968; Ellis and Hammack 1968; Thompson 2007).
Rock imagery at Hueco Tanks was placed in both accessible and hidden contexts. The sheer number
of images apparently indicates repeated petitions, thought by Pueblo groups to increase the effectiveness of prayer (Ellis and Hammack 1968). Most of the images are located at low elevations on the rock
hills, in rockshelters and other settings that can be readily accessed from living areas. Though clearly
serving sacred purposes, the proximity of these images to areas that were intensively occupied suggests
that they were equivalent to household shrines, visited regularly and incorporated into daily life. Ethnological and rock imagery studies in other parts of North American have found that many sacred aspects
of Native American life are intrinsic rather than being conducted in separate domains (Whitley 1998).
Social memory is carried most effectively through places that have both practical utility and cosmic
significance (Crumley 1999).
While other rock imagery styles are limited almost entirely to the lower outcrops, Jornada Style
figures also are found on upper levels of the hills and in locations that are hidden and difficult to access,
e.g., beneath boulders, in narrow crevices, and on ceilings and high walls of rockshelters (Kirkland 1940;
Sutherland 1975). One striking Jornada Style image near the top of West Mountain makes effective use
of natural contours in the rock to depict the rainwater that is captured in cracks and huecos as it flows
to the base of the hills (Figure 74). These less accessible images probably represent shrines (Kirkland and
Newcomb 1967) that were not intended to be viewed by persons outside the community, and perhaps
only by a segment of those living at Hueco Tanks. In other parts of the region, sacrosanct Native shrines
were difficult to access and said to be potentially dangerous places for all but religious leaders (Ellis and
Hammack 1968). Spiritual guides probably directed the design and placement of rock imagery at Hueco
Tanks, and maintained those sacred precincts.
The technology used to apply rock imagery also may have had ritual aspects. Pigments included
hematite, limonite, and kaolinite nodules, found at Hueco Tanks Village and near rock imagery site
W36D. Considerable effort must have been required to obtain these soft minerals, which were only

299

Research Findings

available from distant sources in the region (Miller and Graves 2009). Receptacles for preparing paint
may be represented by over 60 bedrock cupules found inside rockshelters. Isolated cupules are interspersed with mortars on bedrock outcrops in CA5, CA7, and NE2, and ca. 50 adjoining cupules on a
boulder at CA4 are coated with a glossy substance. If these small hollows were used for preparing pigment, urine may have been the binder, for uric acid has been identified through chemical analysis of
shiny laminated deposits in cupules in the region (Kemrer and Corder 2000). The number of cupules
on the rock in CA4 far exceeds the colors of the imagery palette, however. Alternatively, the repetitive
grinding required to create cupules could have been a ritual act in itself.
In contrast to the abundant rock imagery, comparatively few artifacts representing ritual activities
or deposits have been reported from Hueco Tanks, although an unknown number could have been
removed by visitors over the years before the park was established. Three rockshelters have yielded items
that may be dedicatory objects purposefully placed in those locations for spiritual rather than practical
reasons. A small piece of fossil coral and a quartz pebble fragment were buried in sediments in a water
retention system on the hills (Davis 1972b, c). A large Chupadero Black-on-white jar sherd was cached
in a crevice above a hueco reinforced by a prehistoric dam in NE2. Shell disk beads from a necklace were
found in a ground-level rockshelter in NE1.
No dedicatory deposits were identified at Hueco Tanks Village, and possible ritual artifacts were not
abundant. Less than 30 were recovered, consisting of fossils, pigment stones, turquoise, quartz, and shell
and stone ornaments. Nineteen came from structures, with the greatest numbers in House 2 (four turquoise fragments and two quartz pieces) and House 6 (two pigment stones, a stone bead, and a fossil).
The association of three of the four items in House 6 with its floor, along with its somewhat larger size,
suggest that it was a communal structure (Miller 2007; Peterson 2001).
Sixteen other rare and possibly ritual artifacts were recovered from the ground surface in other areas
of the park: fossils from CA2, CA5, CA7, ES2, NE1, NW2, SB3, SB5, and WS1; a shell or calcite bead
from CA4; a perforated mussel shell from CA5; four shell fragments from SB3; and a cruciform made
of locally-available obsidian from NE1. These items are widespread but not abundant, and apparently
were dropped or lost in living areas rather than being ritually deposited.
The general paucity of ritual items at Hueco Tanks, along with its abundant rock imagery, stand
in diametric contrast to Picture and Ceremonial Caves, two other focal points on the spiritual landscape of the eastern Hueco Bolson. Located 3 miles west of Hueco Tanks on a Hueco Mountain outlier,
these caves are over five times larger than any rockshelter at the Tanks. They apparently were sacrosanct
precincts at the nexus of the sacred landscape. Picture Cave has abundant Jornada Style rock imagery,
but few items were found on its floor. Ceremonial Cave lacks rock imagery but utilitarian items were
deposited there in astounding numbers, including some 1300 sandals, wooden darts tipped with stone
points, basketry, and other items. Non-utilitarian items were less numerous but included beads, pendants, bracelets of marine shell and turquoise, prayer sticks, and fragments of tablitasâterraced headdresses made of split yucca stalks tied or glued together and painted (Cosgrove 1947; OâLaughlin 1977;
Sayles 1935). The quantity and variety of materials found in this cave are unparalleled in the region
(Creel 1997), and they appear to be ritual offerings (Cosgrove 1947). Many of the yucca leaf sandals are
worn and fragmentary, as if they were left at the end of pilgrimages (Cosgrove 1947; Ellis and Hammack
1968). As shrines of overarching importance in the region, Ceremonial and Picture Caves probably drew
worshipers for centuries, surely including many persons from nearby Hueco Tanks.
Differences between the rockshelters at Hueco Tanks and the two large Hueco Mountain caves shed
light on their respective roles in the sacred landscape of the eastern Hueco Bolson. Ceremonial and
Picture Caves are positioned 200 ft above the basin floor, while almost all of the rockshelters at the

301

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Tanks are within 20 ft of ground level. Water sources are abundant and available near the Tanks shelters,
but minimal at Ceremonial and Picture Caves. Jornada Style rock imagery was painted in 44 percent
of the low-level rockshelters at the Tanks, but among the ca. 130 rockshelters on the Hueco Mountain
outlier, is limited almost entirely to Picture Cave. The vast quantities of sandals, other utilitarian items,
and ritual items found in Ceremonial Cave have no known equivalent at Hueco Tanks. These differences strongly suggest that Picture and Ceremonial Caves were reserved almost entirely for ceremonial
practices, while the numerous rockshelters near ground level at Hueco Tanks were used primarily for
habitation. By extension, the widespread rock imagery in low-elevation shelters at the Tanks seems likely
to represent solicitations for recurring needs rather than prayer petitions made on holy pilgrimages. The
water, plant, and wildlife resources at Hueco Tanks apparently were too abundant for this place to be set
aside as a sanctuary, despite its spiritual significance.
Though Hueco Tanks was not at the nexus of the sacred landscape it held another special role, as
evidenced by the number of individuals who were laid to rest there over a considerable span of time.
Prehistoric human burials are not common in the southern Jornada Mogollon area (Mauldin 1995;
Miller 1990; Whalen 1994), and the number of graves at Hueco Tanks exceeds any other site in the
region. Among the 13 known human burials, one may date to the Archaic period, three are Formative,
five date to the DoÃ±a Ana phase, and one is broadly dated from the DoÃ±a Ana phase through the Protohistoric period. These interments represent a burial tradition that was carried on for 1,000 years at a
minimum, and possibly much longer. Thirteen graves are in open areas and two are in rockshelters or
crevices. Two persons were buried with large El Paso Brownware sherds covering their heads, a ritual
practice rarely seen in the southern Jornada Mogollon area (Brook 1971, 1976; Miller 1990). Shell beads
were associated with the crevice burial at the Tanks, and the culinary shoe pot with that burial is rare in
the region, as a grave inclusion or otherwise. Although DoÃ±a Ana phase graves typically were placed in
isolated locations at some distance from residential areas (Miller 1990), human remains were found in
or near four of the houses at Hueco Tanks Village. Given the complexity of the rock hills and the limited
knowledge of buried cultural deposits at Hueco Tanks, it seems likely that many more persons than
these were laid to rest at this hallowed place.
Ritual practices also may be evidenced in the architecture of Hueco Tanks Village. Like almost all
of the rectangular structures in the region (Miller et al. 2009), the houses in the Village are oriented
east-west, with entrances facing south. This orientation provided practical benefits of light and warmth
(Bentley 1992b), but also indicates some awareness of celestial movements (Brook 1979b) and possibly
a cosmological rationale for settlement layout (Miller et al. 2009).
In sum, ritual practices at Hueco Tanks extend back to the Archaic, but appear to date primarily
to the DoÃ±a Ana phase, when occupation was intensive. Secular and sacred precincts apparently were
established on the lower and upper elevations of the rock hills, respectively. Although a major spiritual
center was located nearby, Hueco Tanks served a special role in the sacred landscape of the eastern
Hueco Bolson as a place to live, obtain and pray for water, commune with the spirits, and lay cherished
individuals in their final resting places. The plant, animal, water, and rock resources of Hueco Tanks that
made it a particularly good place to meet the needs of daily life apparently prevented it from achieving
the sacrosanct status of precincts like Ceremonial and Picture Caves, which offered almost none of these
resources and show little evidence of long-term occupation.
To the present day, Hueco Tanks continues to be a place where people connect with spirits past and
present. Native American groups professing historical and sacred relationship to the Tanks include the
Mescalero Apache Tribe, Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma, Comanche Indian Tribe, Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, and
Pueblo of Isleta (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 2004).

Research Findings

HISTORIC OCCUPATION
Accounts indicate that the first Europeans came through Hueco Tanks in 1692, while the oldest
tangible historic evidence dates to the 1840s. Artifacts, inscriptions, buildings, and dams indicate that
activities since that time have been concentrated around and northeast of the pass between North and
East Mountains, and in the Central Area (see Table 50).
The 1692 account of Captain General Diego de Vargas reports that he took troops seeking salt along
the trail that led through the Tanks toward the salt flats near the Guadalupe Mountains, guided by an
Apache captive. He apparently was the first person to describe this landmark as a zerro hueco (cerro
hueco or hollow hill; De Vargas 1692). Although physical evidence of this period has not been found,
undated lead slag and part of a large Mexican pot found in CA4 might place Spanish presence on the
north side of the Central Area.
Soon after the territory became part of the United States in the mid-nineteenth century, Hueco
Tanks was an established way station on the trail that led from the Pecos River to El Paso and points
west. The redundant designation âTanksâ was applied in the late 1840s by persons visiting this landmark
(Dillon 1960). During that time, activities focused on a large pool of water impounded inside a rockshelter in CA7. By 1849, gold seekers heading to California in great numbers traveled the trail through
the Tanks, and a few marked their names on the rocks. Traffic through the Tanks increased fivefold in the
1850s, including cattle drives and wagon trains. The names of famous travelers who passed through the
Tanks during this timeâBartlett, Marcy, Popeâare conspicuously absent, while less renowned persons
took time to commemorate their brief visits with inscriptions on the rocks in CA7 and NE2.
A stage station was established at Hueco Tanks for the Butterfield Overland Mail line in 1858, and
operated for a year or less. Two roads led west from the Hueco Mountains to Hueco Tanks at that time
(Ormsby 1858), currently represented by straight, shallow gullies. The roads joined in NE2 and turned
south to pass between North and East Mountains (Conkling and Conkling 1947). The station was a
square corral with a room in one corner, built of local stone mortared with adobe. It probably was
located a short distance from the rock hills, and the entrance likely faced southeast toward the road. At
some point in 1859, the stage line abandoned this route in favor of a southern trail along the Rio Grande
that was better guarded from Indian attack.
The station ruins were observed by the Conklings in the late 1930s but are no longer evident. Several lines of evidence place the stage station on the southeast side of North Mountain in NE2, near the
rockshelter that contains imagery site N17G: traces of the stage roads approach the Tanks at this point,
rock imagery resembling the panels described by stage travelers is nearby, inscriptions from the 1850s
through the 1880s are concentrated in this area, and a few artifacts dating to the mid-nineteenth century
were found in that area.
Over the following decades, inscriptions were concentrated around the abandoned stage station,
and travelers apparently stayed within its protective walls. Among these visitors was a Buffalo Soldier
from the 9th Cavalry, who likely was stationed 90 miles to the south at Fort Quitman in September 1869.
As late as December 25, 1878, a crew surveying railroad tracts sheltered in the station after a heavy snow
(Bowden 1975). Visitation tripled in the 1880s as represented by inscriptions near the abandoned stage
station, and the Tanks had become a recreational destination by the 1890s, when names of local political
figures were set down on the rocks.
Ranching began at Hueco Tanks in 1895 when Juan Armendariz purchased three sections embracing the rock hills. In 1898, Silverio Escontrias obtained title to most of the area now in the state park
and established a cattle and horse ranch. Three structures were built by 1904: an adobe ranch house, a
303

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

three-room residence, and a stable; the latter two were constructed with stones that probably were taken
from the stage station ruins.
Water was an early and important component of the Escontrias stock raising operation. Fifteen
dams were built to catch water from the rock hills; the oldest apparently was a large earthen dam behind
the ranch house, evident in a photograph taken around 1911. Two more dams had been built by 1916:
Tanque de las Piedras, and a long dam that ran between North and West Mountains. By the 1920s,
Tanque de la Virgen had been constructed. These early dams were made of earth and rock, and include
the three longest dams at Hueco Tanks. Five other dams were built by the 1930s; stone and concrete were
first used during that decade to build dams in Mescalero Canyon and on North Mountain. The 1940s
saw construction of two more dams, including a stone and concrete dam west of the ranch house.
Recreational activities at Hueco Tanks that had begun informally in the 1880s continued to
increase. When the Escontrias ranch was established, visitation shifted to the north side of North
Mountain, which developed into a picnic ground during the early twentieth century. Almost half of
the inscriptions in the park are in that area, and illustrate the damage that can result from intensive,
unmonitored visitation.
From 1941 through the 1950s, Hueco Tanks was within Fort Blissâs extensive Maneuver Area 2,
leased from landowners including the Escontrias family, who retained the right to reside and ranch on
their property. Military training was conducted in the central and southeast part of Hueco Tanks in
CA4, CA5, ES3, and possibly other locations. A landing strip had been built north of NW3 by 1943, and
probably was used by small planes that towed targets for antiaircraft training.
After the Escontrias family sold the ranch in 1956, several short-lived recreation complexes were
built around the old ranch house. Developers then purchased the property, bulldozed a subdivision grid
across one area, and constructed an earthen dam to make a lake between the rocks that only filled once.
In 1965 the city of El Paso bought the property, and it became a state park in 1970 (Myers 1997).

SUMMARY
Humans have been at Hueco Tanks for around 10,000 years; cultural components representing this
extensive span can be isolated horizontally and vertically, and have a high research potential. Water was
the main resource that spurred use of areas around the rock hills. Beginning in prehistoric times it was
retained behind simple dams, allowing greater numbers of people to gather. Archaic groups hunted the
abundant and diverse animal population, and processed wild plants in rock mortars while occupying
nearby shelters. The most intensive occupations took place during the DoÃ±a Ana phase; groups occupying multiple areas were supported in part by corn and beans cultivated in small fields on moist soils.
Leaf succulents were harvested from patches where they thrived, and roasted in bulk in rock-lined pits.
Almost all of the items used by prehistoric groups were obtained in or near the Hueco Bolson, but pottery reached the Tanks through an interregional trade network that involved groups to the north and
northwest, and to a limited extent, Mexico. Hueco Tanks was a focal point in the sacred landscape of the
eastern Hueco Bolson for a thousand years or longer. The abundant rock imagery primarily represents
ritual petitions for rain; sacred precincts were established high on the hills, and the Tanks were the final
resting place for many. Native groups established a trail through the Tanks toward water and salt sources
on the east, and their descendants guided military scouts and travelers along it, beginning in 1692.
Although a stage station was briefly established at the Tanks, the first permanent historic occupation was
the Escontrias ranch, which operated from 1898 to 1956. Military training was conducted at the Tanks

Research Findings

in the 1940s and 1950s. Recreational activities that began before the turn of the century continued to
increase, culminating in establishment of the state park in 1970.
The current investigations have shed new light on many aspects of Hueco Tanksâ long cultural history. Although the general parameters of prehistoric occupation at Hueco Tanks have long been known,
it is now clear that the entire span of human occupation in the region is represented, and that activities
focused on particular areas during certain time periods. Intensive Late Archaic occupation, rare in the
region, is suspected to have occurred at the Tanks. The DoÃ±a Ana phase Hueco Tanks Village, one of
the first occupations dated to this period in the southern Jornada Mogollon area, now appears to be
only one element in the intensive use of the Tanks during that period. Examination of the few recorded
prehistoric water retention systems has fostered an appreciation for the engineering know-how of their
builders, and increased the awareness that many more such facilities probably exist at the Tanks. The
significant role of Hueco Tanks in the sacred landscape of the eastern Hueco Bolson is increasingly
evident, though considerable work remains to establish its context relative to religious and ideological
developments in the Jornada Mogollon area, now coming to the forefront of regional research (e.g.,
Miller and Graves 2009).
Heretofore unknown details on historic use of the Tanks also have been revealed. Presence of named
native tribes has been extended back to 1692, and is substantiated by rock imagery and dated features.
The designation hueco is now believed to have been dubbed in that year by Capitan General Diego de
Vargas, in the earliest known historic account of this landmark. The situation of Hueco Tanks along a
trail of evenly-spaced springs and the likely prehistoric origin of that trail are more fully appreciated.
Although the placement of the 1858-1859 stage station has not been established with certainty, it is now
suspected to be in a location well south of the historical marker that commemorates it. A window on
the long-lived Escontrias ranch occupation has opened through newly-discovered photographs of the
ranch complex taken in 1939. The history of dam construction has been elicited from period maps and
photographs. The role of the Tanks in military training and purpose of the air strip at the north end of
the park are now linked, and dated to the World War II era.
Although many aspects of life at Hueco Tanks have come to light in the course of the current investigations, countless hidden facets of this significant place remain to be explored. Recommendations for
further phases of investigations are provided in the final section of the Management Plan that follows
these research findings.

MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR CULTURAL RESOURCES

by Margaret Howard

Cultural and natural resource protection has the highest priority in the operation of Hueco Tanks
State Park and Historic Site (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 2000:12). In 1998, the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department (TPWD) implemented a Public Use Plan for this park with the primary aim
of protecting these significant and fragile resources. It divides the park into two management zones with
differing levels of access. Most of North Mountain and areas near it are accessible on a self-guided basis.
The remaining two-thirds of the park is accessible on tours led by guides who have received 3 days of
training on the significance of the parkâs resources, and the laws, rules, and policies that protect them.
Guides are held responsible for educating persons on their tours about the resources of Hueco Tanks,
and ensuring that they adhere to all applicable laws and regulations. Except during rare events like the
annual Interpretive Fair, visitation in the park is limited to a maximum of 70 visitors in the unguided
area and 160 persons in the guided area at one time; groups in the guided area consist of up to 10 persons on recreational tours, and as many as 25 persons on educational tours (TPWD 1998, 2000).
Every adult visitor to the self-guided area in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site receives an
orientation before they are allowed to enter that part of the park, and must review it annually. In the
16-minute orientation video, visitors are informed about the significance of the cultural and natural
resources at Hueco Tanks and the laws that protect them, and are encouraged to take part in the stewardship of those resources. Many visitors comment that they had been coming to Hueco Tanks for years,
but were not aware of its significance until they received the orientation. Visitors also feel that their presence has been recognized by park staff, and may be less likely to mark graffiti, take artifacts, or commit
other acts of vandalism. Since this policy was instituted in 1998, over 107,000 visitor orientations have
been given at Hueco Tanks.
The current investigations also support the protection and management of cultural resources in
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site. Data on the significance of cultural resources allow for priorities to be established for protection of the resources that are most significant and/or threatened. If
changes in the levels of activity or uses of particular areas of the park are contemplated, these data allow
for evaluation of the potential benefits or losses to cultural resources that may result. If development of
additional park facilities should be required, this information will focus scoping efforts on areas of the
park where damage to significant cultural resources is least likely to occur, potentially minimizing costs
and time delays. The findings of this report also enhance the ability to interpret the history of Hueco
Tanks for the public.
This section opens with a review of the laws and regulations that mandate stewardship of cultural
resources on properties owned and controlled by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The degree
of archeological sensitivity of areas across the park is then reviewed. Anticipated causes of damage to
significant cultural resources in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site are next considered, including natural processes, visitation and operation impacts, and construction and maintenance activities.

307

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Procedures are provided for addressing these impacts in compliance with state law and agency policy.
The section concludes with recommendations for archeological investigations that may be needed in the
future, and for interpretation of its 10,000 year record.

MANDATE FOR CULTURAL RESOURCES PRESERVATION
The stewardship role of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department toward archeological and historic
resources on property owned or controlled by the agency is defined in the Antiquities Code of Texas
(Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191), which calls for the location and protection
of all archeological sites on the lands of public entities in the State of Texas:
It is the public policy and in the public interest of the State of Texas to locate, protect, and
preserve all deposits, objects, buildings, pre-twentieth century shipwrecks, and locations of
historical, archeological, educational, or scientific interest, including but not limited to prehistoric and historical American Indian or aboriginal camp deposits, dwellings, and habitation deposits, cultural resources of every character, treasure imbedded in the earth. . . in, on,
or under any of the land in the State of Texas. (Antiquities Code of Texas, Section 191.002)
All of the archeological sites on lands owned by the State of Texas are state archeological landmarks,
and are eligible for official designation:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological, scientific, or educational interest, including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical American Indians or aboriginal camp deposits, dwellings, and habitation deposits, their
artifacts and implements of culture, as well as cultural resources of every character that are
located in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any
county, city, or political subdivision of the state are state archeological landmarks and are
eligible for designation. (Antiquities Code of Texas, Section 191.092)
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site was officially designated as a State Archeological Landmark on February 22, 1983, because it meets all five of the Landmark criteria:
1. the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or history
of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. the siteâs cultural resources and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
4. the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby
contributing to new scientific knowledge; and
5. the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and official landmark designation is needed to insure maximum legal protection, or alternatively further

308

Management Plan for Cultural Resources

investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the site
cannot be protected. (Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas, Chapter
26, Section 26.8)
Protection of archeological sites on state lands is enhanced by the fact that information on the location and content of all of these sites is exempt from the Open Records Act (Texas Government Code,
Chapter 552):
Information specifying the location of any site or item declared to be a state archeological
landmark. . . [and/or] specifying details of a survey to locate state archeological landmarks
under this chapter is not public information. (Antiquities Code of Texas, Section 191.004)
The Texas Historical Commission designates State Archeological Landmarks, holds vigilance over
them, and issues permits to qualified archeologists for their investigation:
Landmarks under . . . Section 191.092 of this code are the sole property of the State of
Texas and may not be removed, altered, damaged, destroyed, salvaged, or excavated without
a contract with or permit from the committee [Texas Historical Commission]. (Antiquities
Code of Texas, Section 191.093)
Any violation of the terms of the Antiquities Code, such as collecting, digging, or defacing cultural
resources on state land without a permit, is a criminal act punishable by a fine and/or jail term:
A person violating any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor, and
on conviction shall be punished by a fine of not less than $50 and not more than $1,000, by
confinement in jail for not more than 30 days, or by both. Each day of continued violation
of any provision of this chapter constitutes a separate offense for which the offender may be
punished. (Antiquities Code of Texas, Section 191.171)
Texas State Park Rules (1996) also classify vandalism of cultural resources on parks as a Class C
misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500:
It is an offense to take, remove, destroy, deface, tamper with, or disturb any artifact or
cultural feature except by permit issued by the director. (Texas State Park Rules, Section
59.134dd)
Federal laws also foster protection of the cultural resources of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic
Site. Because the park is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, federally licensed, funded, or
permitted activities that are undertaken in the park are governed by Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (16 USC 470 et seq.). If these types of activities will affect the cultural resources
of Hueco Tanks, TPWD must contact the Texas Historical Commission, Indian tribes, members of
the public, and other interested parties in advance of the project, and consult with them on ways to

309

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

avoid, minimize, or mitigate the adverse effects of those activities. Under the Archaeological Resources
Protection Act of 1979 (16 USC 470aa-mm), persons who take archeological materials from Hueco
Tanks in violation of state law, and buy/sell, exchange, or transport them across state or national lines
may be imprisoned or assessed steep fines.
Thus, state and federal laws and regulations assign the responsibility for identifying and protecting
archeological sites on agency lands to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, under the vigilance of
the Texas Historical Commission. Tools provided to accomplish this task are the protective powers of
official State Archeological Landmark designation, confidentiality of archeological site information, and
criminal penalties for vandalism. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department personnel can use these tools to
protect the cultural resources of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site.

SIGNIFICANT AREAS OF HUECO TANKS STATE PARK
AND HISTORIC SITE
The entire area within the boundary of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site constitutes site
41EP2, which was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on July 14, 1971, and officially designated as a State Archeological Landmark on June 28, 1983. The 29 archeological localities that have been
defined within this area differ in terms of the significance of the cultural resources they contain, and the
degree to which they have been impacted by natural processes and human activities. The susceptibility
of each locality to damage depends on the fragility of the cultural resources it contains, as well as the
level of visitation and natural processes in that area.
These factors have been used to identify zones of high and low archeological sensitivity within
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site (Figure 75). The zone of high archeological sensitivity encompasses areas that contain significant cultural resources that are susceptible to damage, while the zone of
low archeological sensitivity includes areas where cultural resources are absent or their research value
is judged to be moderately low. The rock hills are included in the zone of high archeological sensitivity
because they have not been intensively surveyed, and the location and significance of cultural resources
in those areas are incompletely known.
Each archeological locality also is rated individually in terms of its research potential and susceptibility to damage. Almost all of the localities contain important information; the most significant localities have unique attributes not found in other areas of the park, and/or manifest intensive occupation
during particular periods as represented by midden-stained sediments and/or high numbers of artifacts. A major factor affecting the research potential of the remaining localities is the degree to which
they have been damaged by various impacts, to be discussed below.
Eight localities are judged to have a high research potential (Table 52). CA2 has the strongest representation of the Mesilla phase of any locality, and is located at the base of the only recorded prehistoric
water retention system in the park. CA6 probably contains a buried early Paleoindian component. Many
time periods are represented at NE2, including Hueco Tanks Village, the full extent of which has not
been determined. The Butterfield stage station also is suspected to have been located in NE2. A Middle
Archaic component may be present in NW1. NW2 includes an intensive late Mesilla phase occupation.
SB4 contains a ring midden that dates to the Historic Native period, and may have been used by Mescalero Apaches and other Indian groups. SB6 was the site of intensive leaf succulent processing during
the DoÃ±a Ana phase. WS2 contains an intensive Late Archaic occupation.

Six localities are judged to have a moderately high research potential. CA5 has a substantial Late
Archaic component. Many time periods are represented at CA7, including Late Archaic, rare Historic
Native, and early-nineteenth-century components. Multiple time periods also are represented at NE1,
including a rare late Paleoindian component. NE4 encompasses the main historic occupation in the
park, but has been impacted by subsequent developments. SB1 was occupied intensively during the
Formative period, but has been damaged by pedestrian traffic. SB5 was the site of intensive processing
of leaf succulents during the DoÃ±a Ana phase, but is severely eroded.
Eight localities are judged to have a moderate research potential. CA1 saw long-term use, but has
been extensively damaged by dam construction. CA3 contains a remnant of an intensive Formative
period occupation, most of which has been lost to dam construction and erosion. CA4 was occupied
throughout the Archaic and Formative periods, but a good part of this locality has been lost to dam construction. Activities occurred at ES3 during the Early Archaic period, but its cultural deposits are diffuse.
NW4 consists of two broken pots, most of which were recovered during the current investigations. SB7
was occupied throughout the Formative period, but not intensively. WS1 and WS3 were occupied in the
Archaic and Formative periods, but never intensively.
Seven localities are judged to have a moderately low research potential. Activities occurred at ES1
and ES2 primarily during the Archaic period, but were not intensive. A human burial was removed from
NE3, and little or no cultural materials remain. The Formative component in NW3 has been severely
damaged by pedestrian traffic. Cultural deposits in SB2, SB3, and WS4 are intact but diffuse, and their
age is poorly known.
Management recommendations are provided for protection of each archeological locality, but are
focused on the 14 localities with high and moderately high research potential. A higher level of vigilance
also should be directed toward seven localities where human remains have been foundâCA1, CA3,
CA6, CA7, ES3, NE2, and NE3âdue to their sanctity and the possibility that additional remains could
be present. Recommended management practices primarily consist of conducting regular patrols of
localities and monitoring them for evidence of vandalism and/or erosion. In addition, the reestablishment of native vegetation should be promoted at all of the archeological localities, so that the cultural
deposits will be stabilized. If evidence of vandalism, erosion, or other damage is discovered, the park
superintendent must immediately notify the designated TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator for the
park, and implement the protective measures that may be requested.
The next two sections describe methods to address ongoing impacts that can damage significant cultural resources in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site, and outline procedures to obtain approval
for construction and maintenance projects in the park.

IMPACTS TO CULTURAL RESOURCES
Cultural resources can be damaged by ongoing human activities and natural processes, as well as
construction and maintenance activities. Impacts that have damaged the significant cultural resources
at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site and/or may do so in the future are erosion, pedestrian traffic, climbing, graffiti, unauthorized artifact collection, and construction. Recommendations are provided for minimizing or eliminating these impacts.

313

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Erosion
The sandy sediments at Hueco Tanks are susceptible to loss through erosion. Sediments that are
not anchored by vegetation or a protective crust are particularly likely to wash or blow away. Erosion
damages cultural resources because it causes artifacts to be displaced, destroying their original context
and lessening their research value. Water erosion concentrates artifacts at the base of steep slopes and
gullies, where they may be further displaced by high water flow. Wind erosion removes sediments that
surround buried archeological components, combining artifacts from multiple time periods in a single
layer on the ground surface. Fragile organic items like basketry and charcoal that are uncovered by erosion deteriorate rapidly when exposed to sun, wind, and water. Erosion also makes artifacts visible to
park visitors, and susceptible to unauthorized collection.
The most severe erosion at Hueco Tanks was initiated when an extensive drainage diversion system
was built by developers between 1960 and 1963, before the park was established. A large earthen dam
was constructed on the west side of the basin between North and West Mountains, using sediments from
a previous dam and a borrow pit on the adjacent basin floor. Several diversion structures were built to
direct water into the central basin. A berm located southeast of the park gathered water from a major
arroyo and sent it north to a location between North and East Mountains, where another long berm
directed the flow west into the basin. As this ill-conceived diversion system failed, its breached structures
directed high-velocity water flows into areas of the park where the natural drainages were insufficient
to carry them. The most severely eroded area is the arroyo between North and East Mountains, initially
intended to send flow into a lake in the central basin. Severe erosion also occurred in the south part of the
park, when an unimproved road between East Spur and West Mountain channeled runoff and became
an arroyo, converging with a road on the southeast side of West Mountain to cut a web of deep gullies.
Arroyos in both of these areas average about 16 ft (5 m) wide and have cut from 1.6 to 13 ft (0.5 to 4 m) deep.
The degree of erosion caused by this drainage project in particular areas of the park has been ranked,
and measures have been recommended for reducing its impacts in those locations (Bryan et al. 1999). A
hydrologic study of the park drainage network will be required to identify and address the root causes of
severe erosion (Worthington 1996b). In the interim, re-vegetation of severely eroded areas and prohibition of pedestrian traffic across them will help to stabilize those areas until the primary factors that have
caused severe erosion can be eliminated.
Nineteen of the 29 archeological localities in the park have experienced some degree of erosion,
though periods of high rainfall in recent years have caused grasses and woody shrubs to spread into
areas that previously had been eroded. Efforts should be focused on forestalling severe erosion in seven
localities: CA3, CA5, CA6, NE2, NW3, SB4, and SB5.
Wind erosion is most destructive in areas of Hueco Tanks where the protective crust on undisturbed
soils has been broken. The best method to minimize the impact of wind erosion in the park is to limit
pedestrian traffic to established trail routes as much as possible. Although restoration of soil crusts
in arid regions begins in as few as 5 years, it can take 50 years or more to achieve its former thickness
(USGS Canyonlands Research Center 2009).
Pedestrian Traffic
Pedestrian traffic is a welcome activity in parks, but can damage cultural resources by trampling
and killing the vegetation that anchors sediments, and/or breaking through the protective crust on
314

Management Plan for Cultural Resources

undisturbed soils. Areas that have been impacted by high levels of pedestrian traffic are increasingly
susceptible to erosion. Artifacts exposed in areas of high pedestrian traffic are vulnerable to unauthorized
collection. At Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site, a trail system was established in 2000 to
concentrate pedestrian traffic on designated routes. Those routes were selected in light of preliminary
findings from the current investigations, and avoid midden-stained soils and other fragile cultural
resources to the greatest extent possible. Native American groups also were consulted, and their input
was considered in decisions on the route. Plans for two phases of trail improvements funded by the
National Recreational Trails Fund were submitted to the Texas Historical Commission for review, and
the Commission concurred with those plans on May 30, 2000, August 16, 2000, and April 23, 2003.
Over 36 percent of the most highly traveled areas of the 5.8 mile long trail system now have a hardened surface consisting of limestone chat held by plastic grids; geotextile was laid on the ground surface
beneath these materials on segments of the trail that cross archeological deposits. The trail materials
protect the ground surface and disperse the weight of pedestrian traffic; their porosity allows water to
infiltrate and does not increase erosion of areas adjacent to the trail. The alkalinity of the chat complements the moderately alkaline soils of the park. As funds allow, remaining sections of the trail outside
improved road beds should be hardened, particularly the spur leading to rock imagery site N17G, which
is severely eroded. The entire route should be kept in good repair and monitored periodically, especially
after heavy rains.
Climbing
Sport climbing at Hueco Tanks began in the 1950s, when technical climbers used ropes and bolts to
scale some of the tallest sheer rock faces in the park. After a gap of several decades, a resurgence of climbing began around 1975, when new routes were pioneered with and without ropes and bolts. An increasing number of boulder climbers came to the Tanks in the 1980s, and defined many boulder climbing
routes, called âproblemsâ. Installation of new bolts for rope climbing was prohibited in 1986. Boulder
climbing increased substantially in the 1990s, and by the end of the decade Hueco Tanks had become
a world-class boulder-climbing destination, and annual visitation reached 140,000, more than triple
the level of a decade earlier. At least 1,400 boulder climbing problems have been defined, and climbers
remain the largest user group to the present day.
Boulder climbing involves the use of feet and hands to scale rocks, sometimes suspended from
overhanging surfaces. Chalk or other substances are often applied to the fingers to secure handholds.
Because it is an extreme sport, participants either climb until they reach the top of rocks or drop into
the hands of spotters or onto crash pads on the ground below. Popular bouldering problems that are
widely known through published guides and the Internet see high levels of use. Skilled climbers find the
greatest challenge in pioneering routes that have never been climbed before.
In Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site, areas in and near pictograph and petroglyph panels
that are at risk of impact from climbing have been declared off limits for that activity, as indicated by
signs posted at those locations. Climbing is permitted inside rockshelters, however, as long as any cultural deposits inside them are not damaged. In 1998, 10 bouldering sites were closed permanently due
to erosion and loss of protective vegetation; 2 more areas were closed in 2000 and 1 area was closed in
2007. During the current investigations, extensive chalk residue and compacted soils lacking vegetation
indicated that climbing impacts were occurring in CA1, NW1, and NW2; bouldering areas in two of
those localities have now been closed permanently. The list of closed climbing routes is posted in the
park and made known to guides. Use of colored chalks or rosins is prohibited, and handholds may not
315

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

be chipped into rock or glued onto it. On each day that a boulder climber or any visitor enters the park,
he or she signs an agreement to abide by all park regulations.
Because the rock hills have not been fully surveyed for cultural resources, it is possible that as-yet
undiscovered rock imagery, cultural deposits, or water retention systems could be inadvertently damaged by climbers. An intensive survey of the rock hills would allow cultural resources in those areas to
be located and protected from the impacts of boulder climbing.
Mitigation of the ongoing impacts of boulder climbing can be addressed through increased cooperation between boulder climbers and park staff. Both groups are equally interested in tracking which
sites are being impacted by climbing, so that they can be protected and the vegetation can be allowed
to regenerate, forestalling permanent closure. A working group of stakeholders including park staff,
cultural and natural resources personnel, boulder climbers, and Native Americans could be formed to
make periodic visits, perhaps annually, to evaluate which areas of the park are being damaged by heavy
use. Digital photographs could be used to rapidly document the condition of sites in comparison to
previous years, and color enhancement of them might reveal and foster the protection of heretofore
unknown rock imagery (Mark and Billo 2002; 2006). Areas found to be suffering from the impacts
of boulder climbing and other types of visitation could be identified, and visitors asked to voluntarily
spend time at other locations, to alleviate use impacts on those popular sites.
Graffiti
Since the 1840s, visitors to Hueco Tanks have commemorated their presence by marking their
names and dates on the rocks. While nineteenth century inscriptions are relatively rare and have historical significance, the number of inscriptions grew rapidly during the twentieth century, as they increasingly overlapped the rock imagery. By the 1990s gang tagging became problematic, along with the use of
spray paint and permanent markers. After the Public Use Plan was instituted in 1998, incidents of graffiti plummeted; over the past decade less than 10 incidents of new graffiti have been occurred, primarily
in the unguided area of the park. Graffiti was noted in 12 of the archeological localities recorded during
the current investigations (see Table 52).
The legacy of graffiti from years past, much of it predating state ownership, is being addressed
as funds allow. Attempts began in 1969 when the property was transferred to the state of Texas, and
professional conservation of rock imagery that had been impacted by graffiti began in 1993. When
conservator J. Claire Dean first inspected the rock imagery sites at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic
Site, she found that natural weathering was relatively minor in all locations except imagery site W13.
Unintentional damage by humans was more common, and had been caused by touching pictographs,
heat and soot from unauthorized fires, and climbersâ chalk and bolts. Intentional vandalism had caused
the greatest damage, including graffiti and an attempt to remove a panel. Permanent ink marker and
spray painted graffiti caused the most severe damage, because they were highly visible and penetrated
deeply into the rock (Dean 1993).
Twelve professional conservation projects have been conducted since 1993, focused on panels that
are most visible to the public. The projects usually have involved removal of graffiti to the extent possible, and then minimizing visibility of the remnants by reintegrating those areas with acrylic paint
matching the surrounding rock. Areas of prehistoric pigment have been avoided in conservation efforts
to date. A list of priorities for future conservation has been developed by park staff; due to the high cost
of these projects, they are scheduled annually as funds allow. Recently developed laser technology holds

316

Management Plan for Cultural Resources

some promise to remove graffiti completely, as its wavelength can be adjusted to target certain colors
while leaving others undisturbed (Dean 2006b:13-14). This method would eliminate the need for reintegration. It was recently tested at Hueco Tanks in an area distant from rock imagery, and successfully
removed spray paint graffiti (Conservation of Sculpture & Objects Studio, Inc. 2009). As funds allow,
rock imagery conservation and graffiti removal at Hueco Tanks should and will continue.
Unauthorized Artifact Collection
Vandalism of archeological sites on state property consists of any artifact collection, metal detection, and/or excavation that is not conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit. These activities may
occur when artifacts and features are visible in unguided areas that are rarely patrolled by park personnel. Decorated ceramics, projectile points, or other objects that appeal to collectors are particularly
vulnerable to vandalism. Telltale signs of vandalism include piles of discarded artifacts near areas where
artifacts were illegally collected from the surface. Unauthorized excavations are indicated by shallow,
irregular pits, with piles of dirt and discarded artifacts nearby. Excavation is the most severe form of
vandalism, because it can destroy the research value of significant buried cultural resources.
Vandalism of the cultural resources of Hueco Tanksâparticularly rocksheltersâprobably began
in the early twentieth century when the rock imagery was publicized in newspaper accounts. Looting
was rampant during the 1950s and 1960s when ownership of the property changed hands frequently;
visitors removed bags of pottery sherds and at times, entire pots. When the state park opened in May
1970 and personnel were stationed on the property, a small number of items continued to be picked
up and brought to the park office by well-meaning visitors, volunteers, and TPWD staff. The locations
where specimens were found were recorded on an ad hoc basis until the early 1980s, when a card system
was instituted for recording artifact provenience (see Methods of Archeological Investigations section).
Currently, visitors are strongly discouraged from picking up artifacts by means of the orientation video,
and through the surveillance of guides and park rangers. No evidence of unauthorized excavations was
noted during the current investigations.
Unauthorized collection and excavation of artifacts on state parks is prohibited by Texas State Park
Rules (Section 59.34dd), which classify non-permitted disturbance of artifacts as a Class C misdemeanor
punishable by a fine of up to $500. When a person is caught in the act of collecting artifacts from Hueco
Tanks State Park and Historic Site, park personnel currently confiscate the artifacts, record the location
where they were found on an artifact card, and submit those materials to the designated TPWD Cultural
Resource Coordinator. Persons committing purposeful acts of vandalism should be issued a citation
by a licensed peace officer. Severe vandalism to significant cultural resources on state property may be
prosecuted under the Antiquities Code of Texas by filing charges with the county attorney.
To forestall the possibility of vandalism in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site, park personnel
should continue to ensure that every adult visitor receives the mandatory orientation annually, and that
guides exercise vigilance over tour groups so that no cultural resources are disturbed. Routine patrols
of unguided areas of the park also will give park visitors reason to believe that their actions are being
monitored. If park staff note that significant cultural resources in unguided areas have been exposed by
wind or water erosion, those areas should be protected by piling dead branches or grass over them so
that they are concealed from the public.
In addition, maps, records, and other forms of data that include locations of the archeological
localities in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site should never be posted in public areas. Even

317

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

among park staff, this information should be limited to persons who have a need to know, based on the
judgment of the superintendent. General information on areas of the park where certain activities took
place during the long record of human presence at Hueco Tanks may be shared with park visitors, and
has been included in the popular history in the Introduction to this report.
Construction
Before Hueco Tanks was acquired by the state of Texas, a number of construction projects had taken
place there. The projects that were most destructive to cultural resources involved dam construction and
water diversion, which damaged parts of nine localities: CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, CA5, CA6, CA7, NE2, and
NE4. SB6 was damaged when a subdivision grid was bulldozed across part of it.
After the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department began managing the site, most of the facilities and
the hard surfaced roads were constructed in areas that lack significant archeological deposits. A more
extensive system of minimally improved service roads, some of which were old ranch roads, does cross
a number of archeological localities, though their precise boundaries were first ascertained through the
current investigations. Like the trail system, service roads now run on major routes, and the remaining
roads have been retired and allowed to re-vegetate. Use of service roads is limited to emergency rescue
and other critical park functions. If these roads are kept in good repair by addition of base materials and
placement of culverts as needed, the minimal traffic that they carry should not cause further damage to
the six archeological localities that they cross: CA1, CA2, WS1, WS2, WS3, and WS4.

CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE REVIEW AND APPROVAL
Of all the activities conducted on TPWD property, construction projects that disturb the ground
surface have the greatest potential to damage cultural deposits. Rehabilitation of existing facilities also
may damage cultural deposits if work extends beyond or below the area that was disturbed originally.
Maintenance activities that disturb the ground surface also can damage cultural deposits. Under the
Texas Antiquities Code, TPWD is fully accountable for all damage to cultural resources, even if it occurs
accidentally or during routine activities.
Approval for actions that may damage archeological sites on lands owned and controlled by TPWD
is governed by a Memorandum of Understanding between TPWD and the Texas Historical Commission
(Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas, Chapter 26, Section 26.16). TPWD
also has established procedures for internal project review by the Cultural Resources Program, outlined
on the flow chart included in the TPWD Project Review Request Form (PWD 779).
The person responsible for compliance with project review and approval procedures is the project
manager. In many cases the park superintendent serves as project manager and takes on that responsibility. The TPWD Project Review Request Form lists timelines for cultural resources review as well as
requirements for review and approval by other TPWD personnel. Projects that will disturb the ground
surface in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site require notification and in some cases review and
approval by the designated TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator, who can be contacted through the
TPWD Cultural Resources Program office (512/389-4736). The Cultural Resource Coordinator reviews
all construction and maintenance projects that will damage cultural resources in the park, and ensures
that they comply with state and federal law, while maximizing the protection of cultural resources.

318

Management Plan for Cultural Resources

Because Hueco Tanks is a state historic site, all projects that could change the appearance of the site or
any structures or features over 45 years old also must be reviewed by the TPWD Director of Historic
Sites. Further authorization for some activities must be obtained from the Texas Historical Commission
(THC), as explained below.
Two types of cultural resource review are specified by TPWD procedures: formal project review and
informal project notification. Formal project review by the designated TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator and sometimes others is required for the following types of projects:
â¢ prescribed burns or hand clearing projects that involve disturbance to the ground surface like fire
lanes, and/or damage rock imagery or historic features;
â¢ grading or maintenance of existing roads, ditches, and trails that involves widening, lengthening,
or deepening beyond their original dimensions;
â¢ new road projects, trail projects, and conversions of unprepared roads or jeep trails into service or
public roads;
â¢ fence construction or replacement projects that involve ground-disturbing activities like fence
line roads, fire lanes, and/or bulldozing;
â¢ new construction or maintenance projects that will affect areas totaling more than 1 acre;
â¢ periodic activities affecting more than 1 acre that were approved over 10 years ago;
â¢ new construction or maintenance projects that will affect 1 acre or less in areas that have not been
disturbed in the past; and
â¢ changes to buildings, structures, and features over 45 years old, or projects that will affect the
views in and/or around these structures.
To initiate a formal cultural resources review, the project manager must submit a TPWD Project
Review Request Form (PWD 779) to the designated TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator for Hueco
Tanks State Park and Historic Site at least 60 days before the proposed start date of the project. The
project manager must provide a complete, accurate, and detailed description of the project, along with
a copy of the USGS 7.5â quadrangle map on which the project location is marked. All borrow areas,
access roads, turnarounds, and other associated areas that will be damaged during the project must be
included in the project description and location.
The TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator will review the information on the Project Review
Request Form, examine information on file, and assess whether significant cultural resources are likely
to be damaged by the project. The Coordinator also will determine whether the project requires approval
by THC and/or other agencies.
The TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator may determine that archeological investigations need to
be conducted before the project is submitted to THC for review, to ascertain whether significant cultural
resources will be damaged. For small projects, the Coordinator may conduct and report on those investigations. In other cases, the Coordinator will assist the project manager to obtain archeological services
from a contractor, and will review and approve the report of findings of those investigations.
When needed, the TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator will prepare a notification letter to THC,
containing information on the type of project development that is proposed, including the anticipated
extent and depth of proposed ground-disturbing activities, any previous impacts that have affected the
319

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

project area, known cultural resources and results from archeological investigations in the project area,
and the project location indicated on a USGS 7.5â quadrangle map.
Upon receipt of the notification letter, THC has 30 days to review the project and determine
whether archeological investigations will be required. When the response from THC is received, the
TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator will either sign a TPWD Archeological Review Response Form
indicating that the project may proceed, or will inform the project manager about further actions that
are required by TPWD and/or THC. When all of the conditions required by THC and TPWD are met, a
signed Archeological Review Response will be issued to the project manager, park superintendent, and
regional director, indicating that the project is authorized to proceed in terms of its impacts on cultural
resources.
TPWD policy requires informal notification of the designated TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator for Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site for the following types of projects:
â¢ prescribed burning and hand clearing conducted without disturbing the ground surface, rock
imagery, or historic structures;
â¢ grading and maintenance projects on existing constructed roads, trails, and ditches that will not
extend beyond or below the original construction zone;
â¢ new or replacement fence construction, or installation of signposts and bollards that do not disturb the ground surface except for postholes;
â¢ periodic activities impacting 10 acres or less that have been formally approved by TPWD and
THC within the past 10 years, and the activity is limited to the area that was approved; and
â¢ projects affecting 1 acre or less that will be confined within the original trench or pit, for example,
minor repair of a water line break.
When TPWD procedures specify that informal notification is allowed, the project manager must
contact the designated TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator for Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic
Site by telephone or email before beginning the project. The notification should include a brief description of the project and its location, and should explain why it appears to qualify for informal notification under the procedures specified in this report, and/or the flow chart included in the TPWD Project
Review Request Form (PWD 779). The Coordinator may require that park personnel who have received
cultural resource training monitor such projects, and inform the Coordinator if any artifacts or other
archeological evidence is uncovered.
This management plan provides a framework for anticipating actions that will be needed to protect the cultural resources of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site, and allows for planning to
minimize the impacts of park operations on those resources. For example, if facility development is
contemplated, TPWD can use the zones of archeological sensitivity (see Figure 75) to place construction projects in areas that will cause the least damage to significant cultural resources. Substantial
cost and time savings can be realized by avoiding the archeological investigations that probably will
be required when significant cultural resources are slated for destruction. TPWD and the Texas Historical Commission also will refer to these zones of archeological sensitivity when they are deciding
whether to require archeological investigations before a construction project is approved to go forward under the Antiquities Code of Texas.

320

Management Plan for Cultural Resources

ACCIDENTAL DISCOVERY OF CULTURAL RESOURCES
Even when TPWD has made diligent efforts to identify all of the cultural resources in a proposed
project area, new or significant cultural resources may be discovered after fully authorized construction projects or maintenance activities are underway, or may be exposed by natural processes like erosion. Human remains that appear to be over 75 years old are among the most significant materials that
may be discovered accidentally. Whenever this occurs, all activities in that area must cease, and the
park superintendent must immediately notify the designated TPWD Cultural Resource Coordinator for
Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site. The Coordinator will inspect the discovery location, record
the cultural resources, and alert the TPWD Cultural Resources Program Director and THC. Additional
protective measures and/or further archeological investigations may be required by THC and/or TPWD
before the project is allowed to proceed.
Because many persons were laid to rest at Hueco Tanks in prehistoric times and a number of those
graves have been exposed by erosion, it is likely that human remains will be discovered in the park in the
future, particularly in eroded areas. TPWD policy LF-99-02 governs situations when human remains are
discovered. The purpose of this policy is to honor the sanctity of those individuals whose remains rest
in or on Department lands. TPWD personnel are responsible for the identification and protection of
human remains and associated funerary objects. Every effort will be made to preserve such remains in
their original place of burial, to prevent any disturbance to them, and to secure the remains from future
disturbance.
If human remains or associated funerary objects are discovered in Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site, the following steps must be taken:
â¢

Cease all activities in the area of discovery immediately.

â¢

Secure the area of discovery, and restrict visitors from that area.

â¢

Make a reasonable effort to protect the human remains or cultural items discovered, without
further impacting the ground surface.

â¢

Do not disclose the specific location of human remains to agency personnel (except as where
noted below), members of the media, and/or members of the public.

â¢

Notify the designated Cultural Resource Coordinator of the discovery as soon as possible, but
no longer than one working day from the time of discovery. If the Resource Coordinator cannot
be reached, notify the Cultural Resources Program Director at 512/389-4736.

â¢

Upon the Cultural Resources Program staff âs determination that the burial is or may be of a
person who has been dead less than 75 years, the appropriate Law Enforcement agency shall be
notified immediately.

â¢

Wait for instructions from the Cultural Resources Program Director, and/or a Law Enforcement
official on the next course of action.

Every effort should be made to leave human remains where they were laid to rest. If the Cultural
Resources Program Director determines that human remains and/or associated funerary objects must
be removed from TPWD lands, they will be retrieved using care and respect, under the direction of the
Cultural Resources Program. Once removed from the ground, all human remains and funerary objects

321

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

will be treated according to the stipulations of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation
Act (25 USC 3001 et seq.). The Cultural Resources Program Director will ensure compliance with all
applicable state and federal laws before, during, and after removal.

FUTURE ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AND INTERPRETATION
Although the cultural resources at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site have a high potential to
advance knowledge of the prehistory and history of the region, preservation of them is the first priority. Future investigations should focus on areas where the inventory of cultural resources in the park is
incomplete, to support increased protection of currently unknown resources. If additional archeological investigations will be conducted in the park, the following projects will advance the preservation of
cultural resources:
â¢ intensive survey of the rock hills, to obtain a complete inventory and ascertain the significance of
the rock imagery, water retention systems, and cultural resources they likely contain;
â¢ hydrologic evaluation of the single known water retention system, including estimation of its
function and capacity;
â¢ development of a detailed database of rock imagery elements, to explore their association with
features like prehistoric dams, and shed light on their age and meaning; and
â¢ if visitation impacts in outlying areas of Hueco Tanks Village cannot be addressed, excavations to
locate house features, fire-cracked rock features, and/or refuse middens that probably are present
in those areas and at risk of loss.
Interpretation also is a primary function of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site; it is one of
nine historic sites that have been determined by TPWD to have the highest priority for full and accurate presentation of the significant stories they have to tell (TPWD 2005:40-41). This report contains
information that can be used to develop interpretive displays and/or popular accounts for park visitors.
Interpretive materials will increase public appreciation of the significance of Hueco Tanks, and encourage better stewardship of its cultural resources. New information that can be used to expand the interpretation of Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site includes the following:
â¢ suspected presence of an early Paleoindian camp;
â¢ greater-than-anticipated presence and level of permanence of groups during the Middle and Late
Archaic;
â¢ extensive occupations during the DoÃ±a Ana phase, in Hueco Tanks Village and elsewhere;
â¢ evidence of leaf succulent processing during the DoÃ±a Ana, (possibly) El Paso, and Historic Native
periods;
â¢ historic origin of the name Hueco Tanks;
â¢ likely location of the stage station; and
â¢ 1939 photograph of the Escontrias ranch house.

APPENDIX BâRADIOCARBON ASSAYS

by Margaret Howard

Thirteen radiocarbon dates were obtained during the current investigations: six on corncobs, six
on charcoal, and one on bone. All of the radiometric assays were made by Beta Analytic, Inc. of Miami,
Florida. The context, age, and significance of each sample are examined here. The phases and periods
mentioned in this section are reviewed in greater detail in the Prehistoric Background section of this

Six Zea mays cobs have been recovered from Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Siteâone during the current investigations and five in the park collection (see Methods of Archeological Investigations section). They were designated by number for the current analysis. The corncobs are relatively
intact but lack kernels; none of them appear to have been burned. The number of rows per cob ranges
from 8 to 16 (Table B1); in the region, 10- and 12-row prehistoric corncobs are most common but 8
row cobs also are well represented (OâLaughlin 2001:267). Three of the corncobs have been identified
to race by Wilkes (1978), but the features on the six cobs have not been quantified as recommended by
Huckell (2006:99-101).
Corncobs 1 through 5 were found in or near archeological localities CA5, NE2, and NW2. Corncob
6 is from the park collection (see Methods of Archeological Investigations), but cannot be identified

to locality. It was submitted for radiometric analysis on the assumption that it would provide general
information on subsistence at Hueco Tanks.
The corncobs were dated by means of accelerator mass spectrometry, to minimize the size of the
samples while increasing the precision of the age estimates (Table B2). Corncob 4 (locality NW2) and
Corncob 6 (unprovenienced) were determined to be modern (Beta 243883 and 243885), and probably are recent picnic refuse. The remaining four corncobs date to the DoÃ±a Ana phase (n = 2), El Paso
phase, and early historic to modern period. The context and age of the corncobs identified to locality
are reviewed individually.
Locality CA5
Corncobs 1, 2, and 3 were incorporated into a packrat midden found in a rockshelter containing
imagery in locality CA5. The midden was collected in November 1973 by avocational archeologist John
Davis and Texas Parks and Wildlife Department archeologist George Kegley, and analyzed by Thomas
Van Devender of the Department of Geosciences at the University of Arizona. It was later reported as
the poorly-indurated âmodernâ HT#3 midden (Van Devender and Riskind 1979:129, 135). The midden most likely can be attributed to white-throated packrats (Neotoma albigula) and/or southern plains
wood rats (Neotoma micropus), whose ranges and habitats include Hueco Tanks (Vaughan 1990:16,
18-19; Worthington 1996:89). Although packrats typically gather most of the plants that comprise their
middens within 30 to 50 m of their dens, up to 38 percent can come from greater distances (Vaughan
1990:17; Finley 1990:35). Organic materials from packrat middens are ideal for radiocarbon dating
(Van Devender 1990:106) if they are pretreated with hot hydrogen chloride and sodium hydroxide
(Webb and Betancourt 1990:86), as these cobs were (see laboratory data sheets).
At the request of David Riskind, Garrison Wilkes of the Department of Biology at the University of
Massachusetts, Boston examined the three corncobs in 1978. Wilkes identified their native races as MaÃ­z
de Ocho (Corncob 1), Pima-Papago (Corncob 2), and teosinte-introgressed Chapalote (Corncob 3). He
described the characteristics of these cobs (Figure B1a-c) as follows:
Certainly one of the cobs [Corncob 1] is an 8-rowed flint; the other two are less clear.
The 12-rowed cob [Corncob 2] could be a flint also and doesnât necessarily have to be a
flour type just because itâs 12-rowed. The cupules on these two cobs, the 8-rowed and the
12-rowed, are very similar as are the subtending glumes. Without an attached seed itâs difficult to be definitive about the endosperm type. These two cobs could have been grown in
the same field and are typical of a variation pattern known to have extended from the upper
Missouri River to the Southwest during this time frame. Corn of this flint/flour type could
have supported a very well fed cultivator at rates from 3,000 to 5,000 plants/acre.
The third cob (8-rowed) is by far the most interesting [Corncob 3]. It is not a typical
8-rowed flint; the cupules are open and not compressed, the condensation is more typical
of flour types yet there is not central pith and the rachis tissue is very dense. The glumes are
thick and indurated indicating considerable introgression from teosinte in the germplasm.
This specimen could be and would make more sense to me if it was 1,000 years earlier,
but it too could have been a segregate from the same field as the other two cobs. This
specimen should not be characterized as âBasketmaker Cornâ. It is a significantly indurated
8 rowed corn with open cupules and little compression. The seeds were more rounded

than flattened, they were reasonably large, and although they were not a popcorn they were
probably popcorn-like in being hard.
To me this is a significant cob because itâs a clear indicator of teosinte introgression in
an archeological specimen from the U.S. This introgression probably did come from teosinte directly but had been carried in the corn germplasm, and this cob was a segregate out
of the larger population (Wilkes 1978).

Appendix BâRadiocarbon Assays

Radiocarbon assays obtained during the current investigations (see Table B2) indicate that two of
the corncobs from locality CA5 date to the DoÃ±a Ana phase (A.D. 1000 to 1300), and one dates to the El
Paso phase (A.D. 1300 to 1450). Corncob 1 is an 8-row cob identified as MaÃ­z de Ocho; its calibrated 2
sigma age range (Beta 243880) brackets a period from A.D. 1040 to 1240, encompassing a good part of the
DoÃ±a Ana phase. Corncob 3 is an 8-row cob identified as teosinte-introgressed Chapalote; its calibrated 2
sigma age range (Beta 243882) brackets a period of A.D. 1160 to 1280, in the late DoÃ±a Ana phase. Corncob
2 is a 12-row cob identified as Pima Papago; its calibrated age has multiple intercepts (Beta 243881), and
the combined 2 sigma ranges bracket a period from A.D. 1310 to 1440, covering most of the El Paso phase.
Moist soils suitable for agriculture are located over 800 m from the packrat midden that contained
these corncobs (see Environmental Background section), so it seems unlikely that packrats obtained
them from a nearby field. The cobs may have been from foodstuffs carried by persons doing activities
other than farming in this area, over a span of some 300 years.
Near Locality NE2
Corncob 5 is in the park collection from NE2. It was collected by a volunteer guide from the rock hill
near that locality, probably from a rockshelter. The dimensions of this 8-rowed cob are similar to Corncobs 1 and 3 from locality CA5 (see Table B1), but its appearance suggests that it is less well-preserved
(Figure B1d).
The radiocarbon assay on Corncob 5 (Beta 243884) places it at the late end of the calibration curve,
where multiple intercepts are common. Two of its calibrated 2 sigma ranges (see Table B2) bracket spans
of A.D. 1640 to 1700 and 1720 to 1820, which fall in the early historic period of Spanish colonization
and native conquest (see Historical Background). The third time range dates this cob to the very recent
past, between 1920 and 1950. Although the possibility that this cob is modern cannot be excluded, materials from the region yielding seventeenth and eighteenth century dates have similarly broad time spans,
but are believed to date to the Protohistoric and/or early Historic periods (Miller 2001).
Locality NW2
A corncob (sample PH-1) was recovered during the current investigations from the surface of a
rockshelter that contains imagery in locality NW2. Paleo Research Institute of Golden, Colorado processed the cob to recover and measure phytoliths that may allow for the distinction of maize varieties
(Puseman et al. 2003; see Appendix C). A radiocarbon assay (Beta 243883) later determined that the cob
is modern (see Table B2).

CHARCOAL
Six of the 23 charcoal samples collected during the current investigations were submitted for radiocarbon assay. The samples were selected due to their association with midden deposits (locality NW2)
and/or fire-cracked rock features (localities SB4, SB6, and WS2). The age of the charcoal sample from
locality NW2 was assayed through standard radiometric analysis, while the remaining five samples were
dated by accelerator mass spectrometry due to their small size.

387

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Locality NW2
Charcoal sample D-22 was collected from Shovel Test 26, located near a rockshelter containing
imagery in locality NW2. A corncob collected from the floor of the shelter also was submitted for radiocarbon assay, but was determined to be modern (see above). The shovel test was placed in an area where
midden-stained sediments were visible on the surface, near a former picnic ground and parking lot.
The charcoal sample was recovered between 40 and 50 cm below surface, at the base of a stratum
of very dark grayish brown (10YR3/2) midden-stained sediments that extended from the surface to a
caliche horizon encountered between 45 and 50 cm below surface. An undifferentiated El Paso painted
sherd that dates between A.D. 800/1000 and 1450 (Miller 1995:212) was recovered in the uppermost
10 cm of the shovel test. One or more El Paso Brownware body sherds (A.D. 200/600 to 1450; Miller
1995:212) were recovered from every level of the test, along with abundant debitage, bone fragments,
and a few fire-cracked rocks. The shovel test also yielded historic/modern lead tube fragments and an
iron rivet in Levels 1, 3, and 5, probably introduced by animal burrowing. A macrofloral sample collected between 20 and 22 cm below surface produced charcoal fragments identified as creosotebush,
mesquite, juniper, and pine (see Appendix C).
Sample D-22 consisted of 10 pieces of charcoal totaling 1.7 g, and was one of the largest charred
wood samples recovered during the survey (see Table B2). Its isotopic fractionation correction of -26.1
indicates that it probably was mesquite or cottonwood (Miller 1996:14-15). The calibrated 2 sigma
range of its radiocarbon assay (Beta 158767) brackets a period between A.D. 670 and 1010, falling
almost entirely within the late Mesilla phase (A.D. 650 to 1000). Coming from the base of the midden
stratum, the sample dates the onset of intensive occupation at this location to the late Mesilla phase, a
phenomenon that has been observed across the region (Mauldin 1995:277-278; Mauldin et al. 1998:158;
Miller 2005:74; Whalen 1994:625). The ca. 40 cm of fine sandy loam above the sample accumulated
since A.D. 1000 and could be alluvial, as the shovel test is located 50 m from a drainage. The age of the
undifferentiated El Paso painted sherd in the uppermost 10 cm of the test falls at the end of the 2 sigma
date range and the sherd may postdate the radiocarbon assay at least slightly, suggesting that the cultural
deposits are stratified. Even though a few historic/modern artifacts were found at depth in this shovel
test, it appears that the cultural deposits in this part of locality NW2 retain a considerable degree of
integrity, despite use of the area as a picnic ground.
Locality SB4
Charcoal samples D-4 and D-8 were recovered from Shovel Test 9, placed in an area of faintly midden stained sediments and within 5 m of Feature 1. This possible ring midden is composed of porphyritic syenite; measuring 11 by 4 m, it is the largest visible fire-cracked rock feature at Hueco Tanks. An
arrow point found on the surface within 3 m of it dates between A.D. 850 and 1450, and is triangular
with a slightly concave base.
Shovel Test 9 passed through 90 cm of grayish brown fine sandy loam, and yielded debitage in
every level. A few undifferentiated El Paso Brownware sherds that date between A.D. 800/1000 and 1450
(Miller 1995:212) were found from 0 to 50 cm below surface, and an arrow point fragment (A.D. 850 to
1450) with a bulbous stem was recovered between 30 and 40 cm. Two bones identified as Sylvilagus sp.
(cottontail) came from the deepest level of the test (see Materials Recovered section).

388

Appendix BâRadiocarbon Assays

Sample D-4 was recovered between 20 and 30 cm below surface, and consisted of five pieces of
wood charcoal totaling 0.33 g. Its isotopic fractionation correction of 22.9 indicates that it probably was
juniper or mesquite (Miller 1996:14-15). Beta radiocarbon assay 262740 determined that it is modern;
recent disturbance could account for its shallow burial.
Sample D-8 was recovered between 80 and 90 cm below surface, and consisted of three pieces of
charcoal totaling 0.35 g. Its isotopic fractionation correction of 22.0 indicates that it probably was juniper (Miller 1996:14-15). The radiocarbon assay (Beta 262741) places it at the late end of the calibration
curve, where multiple intercepts are common. Two of its calibrated 2 sigma ranges (see Table B2) span
periods of A.D. 1650 to 1700 and 1720 to 1820, overlapping the end of the Protohistoric period (A.D.
1581 to 1659) and the early Historic period (post-1659). The third time range falls in the mid-nineteenth century (1840 to 1880), and the fourth dates it to the very recent past, between 1920 and 1950.
Features yielding seventeenth and eighteenth century dates in west Texas and southern New Mexico
with similarly broad time spans are believed to date to the Protohistoric and/or early Historic periods
(Miller 2001:115, 119-120). The two oldest age ranges for Feature 1 bracket a period from 1650 to 1820;
during that time, Mescalero Apache groups roamed the region, frequenting landforms like Hueco Tanks
that offered views of the surrounding area, and subsisting in part on roasted agave (see Prehistoric
Background section). A group of Apache hunters was encountered at Hueco Tanks by Spanish troops
in 1692, and in 1777, a Mescalero Apache emissary reported that bands from the Sierra Blanca, Sacramento, and Organ Mountains were camped near the Tanks (see Historical Background section).
Although recognition of Protohistoric features is challenging (Kenmotsu and Miller 2008, Lukowski
et al. 2007:57-60; Seymour 2008), Feature 1 meets most of the criteria that have been proposed for them,
and resembles the few reported features of this age. Radiocarbon assays have provided the only incontrovertible evidence of Protohistoric features to date, as they usually have been found on multicomponent sites (Miller 2001:115-124). The fire-cracked rock features identified to this time frame generally
are exceptionally large (greater than 10 m) and/or well-preserved (Miller 2001:154; Sale 1991:67).
Reported Protohistoric features include Feature 100 at the Cerro Rojo site, located 7.5 miles northeast of Hueco Tanks. This ânondescript cluster of fire-cracked cobbles with excessive ashâ was dated to
this period by two radiocarbon assays with 2 sigma ranges of A.D. 1490 to 1950 and A.D. 1640 to 1950
(Kenmotsu and Miller 2008:235, 237; Seymour 2002:119, D-18; 2004:182). In the San Andres Mountains of southern New Mexico, large rock-lined pits on sites LA72169 and LA72860 date to the 1600s
(Sale 1991:56-57; Miller 2001:119).
Arrow points that may date to the Protohistoric include distinctive Soto points (Phelps 1987), as
well as small triangular side- or basally-notched forms (Miller 2001:128). The two arrow point fragments that are associated with Feature 1 do not resemble these forms, however.
If Feature 1 is a late Protohistoric/early Historic ring midden, the 80 to 90 cm depth of sample D-8
can be accounted for by digging that would have taken place in areas near it to obtain sediment to cover
the roasting pit. This activity also would have caused ceramics and arrow points from the earlier Formative period occupation at this locality to be incorporated into the Protohistoric/early Historic feature.
Feature 1 in SB4 is less likely to date to the mid-nineteenth century time span (1840 to 1880) of the
radiocarbon assay, for by that time, Hueco Tanks was on a well-used trail and would have offered little
protection to native groups conducting traditional subsistence practices. The latest time range (1920 to
1950) is least likely to accurately date the sample, given its 90 cm depth below surface.

389

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Locality SB6
Charcoal sample D-23 was recovered from the center of Feature 10, a large concentration of firecracked rocks in a group of 14 widely spaced fire-cracked rock features in locality SB6. Seventy percent
of the rocks comprising this feature are limestone; the other features also are composed primarily of
limestone. Feature 10 covers a 3.7 by 2.6 m area and has a central concentration of rocks measuring 1.6
by 1.2 m, adjoined by two smaller rock piles (see Figure 26c). It resembles features at Castner Range suspected to be agave roasting pits, adjoined by small hearths that apparently were used to heat the rocks
(Hard 1983:23-27; 51-52).
Shovel Test 31 was placed on the edge of the central rock concentration, and passed through a stratum of fire-cracked rocks that was 28 cm thick. An El Paso Polychrome sherd that dates between A.D.
1000/1100 and 1450 (Miller 1995:212) and one piece of debitage were recovered in the uppermost 10
cm of the test. Sample D-23 was collected between 28 and 30 cm below surface, at the base of or slightly
below Feature 10.
Sample D-23 consisted of seven pieces of wood charcoal totaling 0.16 g. Its isotopic fractionation
correction of -22.7 indicates that it probably was juniper (Miller 1996:14-15). Its calibrated age (Beta
260733) has multiple intercepts (see Table B2); the combined 2 sigma ranges bracket a period from A.D.
980 to 1140, falling almost entirely within the early DoÃ±a Ana phase (A.D. 1000 to 1150). The age of the
El Paso Polychrome sherd in the upper part of the feature overlaps this date range. Feature 10 appears
to have been used for processing agave during a time when wild species dominated the plant foods consumed at sites like Gobernadora and Ojasen (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004:248; Shafer et al. 1999:307).
Locality WS2
Charcoal samples D-9 and D-10 were recovered from Shovel Tests 12 and 13 in locality WS2, within
the largest cluster of fire-cracked rock features at Hueco Tanks. Most of these 63 features are small
hearths made primarily of syenite that probably were used for cooking or heating. Their close spacing
suggests that they might have been used contemporaneously, and could represent a large encampment.
Sample D-9 was collected between 20 and 30 cm below surface in Shovel Test 12. The test was placed
within 1 m of fire-cracked rock Features 1, 2, and 3, which have maximum dimensions of 130 cm, 140
cm, and 100 cm respectively. The test passed through a stratum of brown (10YR4/3) midden-stained
sediments that extended from the surface to a depth of 55 cm. Debitage was recovered in most levels,
along with a few fire-cracked rocks. Sample D-9 consisted of two pieces of wood charcoal totaling 0.1
g. Its isotopic fractionation correction of -24.9 indicates that it may have been creosotebush, apache
plume, mesquite, oak, or cottonwood (Miller 1996:14-15). The calibrated 2 sigma range of its radiocarbon assay (Beta 260731) brackets a period from 10 B.C. to A.D. 140, falling near the end of the Late
Archaic period (1200 B.C. to A.D. 200).
Sample D-10 was collected between 40 and 50 cm below surface in Shovel Test 13. The test was
located 50 m from Shovel Test 12 and within 15 m of Features 44 and 46, both of which measure less
than 1 m in maximum dimension based on photographs. Beneath 30 cm of loose, light-colored windblown sand, the test hit a stratum of dark brown (10YR3/3) midden-stained sediments that was 40 cm
thick, extending to a depth of 70 cm. Sample D-10 was recovered between 10 and 20 cm below the top
of the midden stratum, along with an untyped dart point fragment that dates generally to the Archaic
period (6000 B.C. to A.D. 200; Miller 2007:3-1). Debitage was recovered from every level of the shovel

test, along with a biface, a drill fragment, and a few small bone fragments. Pollen and macrofloral samples collected between 32 and 45 cm below surface primarily yielded wild plant remains and charcoal
fragments identified as saltbush, creosotebush, mesquite, and juniper or pine (see Appendix C).
Sample D-10 consisted of one piece of charcoal totaling 0.17 g. The specimen did not resemble
wood but was shiny and appeared to be slightly vitrified, like the fragment of unidentified knot wood
identified by Puseman et al. (2003) in the macrofloral sample from this shovel test (see Appendix C).
Its isotopic fractionation correction of -9.3 is indicative of corn (Miller 1996:14-15; see Table B2), but
four-wing saltbush and other plants that also follow a C4 photosynthetic pathway can yield similar
ratios (Myles Miller, personal communication 2009). The calibrated 2 sigma range of this radiocarbon
assay (Beta 260732) brackets a period from 10 B.C. to A.D. 140, falling near the end of the Late Archaic
period (1200 B.C. to A.D. 200).
The time spans of these two assays are identical, even though isotopic fractionation indicates that
the samples were from different types of plants (see Table B2). Both samples came from the upper part
of the midden stratum. Additional radiocarbon assays of the 63 fire-cracked rock features in this cluster
would be required to confirm this assertion, but the data in hand, along with the absence of ceramics
in Shovel Tests 12 and 13, suggest that the entire cluster of hearths in WS2 dates to the end of the Late
Archaic period.

Two turkey bone fragments that refit were recovered in Levels 1 and 2 of Shovel Test 16 in locality
CA4. The test was placed in an area where midden-stained sediments are visible on the surface, and
encountered faintly stained sediments to a depth of 30 cm, overlying light-colored sediments to a depth
of 60 cm. Debitage was recovered from every level of the test. One plain ceramic sherd recovered between
30 and 40 cm had finer temper and lighter paste than El Paso Brownware but could not be typed; it dates
generally to the Formative period (A.D. 200 to 1450; Miller 2007:3-1). Modern glass, crown caps, and
aluminum foil in the uppermost 40 cm of the test indicate that the area had been used for picnicking.
The distal tibiotarsus shaft and unfused epiphysis are from a subadult turkey (Meleagris gallopavo).
Wild turkeys currently are rare in the region (Mark Lockwood, personal communication 2009); by 1907
hunters had extirpated them from the nearest part of their range in the Guadalupe Mountains, 90 miles
east of Hueco Tanks (Lockwood and Freeman 2004:17). Historical accounts do not mention turkeyraising at Hueco Tanks (see Historical Background).
The bones were submitted for radiocarbon assay due to the possibility that they were prehistoric,
as turkey bones have not been reported from archeological sites in the Hueco Bolson (OâLaughlin
2005:242, 247). The two bone fragments totaled 2.14 g. Beta radiocarbon assay 26730 determined that
they postdate 1950, however (see Table B2). They probably are recent picnic refuse.

SUMMARY
Nine of the 13 samples submitted for radiocarbon assay during the current investigations yielded
prehistoric dates. The oldest are two charcoal samples from WS2 that are associated with a large cluster
of fire-cracked rock features, and date to the end of the Late Archaic period. One charcoal sample at the
base of a midden stratum in NW2 dates to the late Mesilla phase. The DoÃ±a Ana phase is represented

by three samples: charcoal from a fire-cracked rock feature in SB6 dating to the early DoÃ±a Ana phase,
a corncob from CA5 from the late DoÃ±a Ana phase, and another corncob from CA5 that brackets the
entire phase. A corncob from CA5 dates to the El Paso phase. A corncob collected near NE2 and charcoal
from a shovel test near a possible ring midden in SB4 apparently date to the late Protohistoric and/or
early Historic periods, but could date as late as the early twentieth century, as they hit multiple intercepts
near the end of the calibration curve.
Four samples yielded modern dates: two corncobs (from locality NW2 and unprovenienced), a
turkey bone from CA4, and charcoal from SB4. The corncobs were recovered from the surface, and the
bone and charcoal were shallowly buried. These specimens evidence recent activities by park visitors.

RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results For Samples HUECO CA4 ST16, HUECO D-9, HUECO D-10,
HUECO D-23
Dear Dr. Howard:
Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for four samples recently sent to us. They each
provided plenty of carbon for accurate measurements and all the analyses proceeded normally. As usual,
the method of analysis is listed on the report with the results and calibration data is provided where
applicable.
You will notice that Beta-260730 (HUECO CA4 ST16) is reported with the units âpMCâ rather
than BP. âpMCâ stands for "percent modern carbon". Results are reported in the pMC format when the
analyzed material had more 14C than did the modern (AD 1950) reference standard. The source of this
"extra" 14C in the atmosphere is thermo-nuclear bomb testing which on-set in the 1950s. Its presence
generally indicates the material analyzed was part of a system that was respiring carbon after the on-set of
the testing (AD 1950s). On occasion, the two sigma lower limit will extend into the time region before
this "bomb-carbon" onset (i.e. less than 100 pMC). In those cases, there is some probability for 18th,
19th, or 20th century antiquity.
As always, no students or intern researchers who would necessarily be distracted with other
obligations and priorities were used in the analyses. We analyzed them with the combined attention of
our entire professional staff.
If you have specific questions about the analyses, please contact us. We are always available to
answer your questions.
Our invoice is enclosed. Please forward to the appropriate office for payment. Thank you for
your prior efforts in arranging payment. As always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the
results, donât hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,

RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results For Samples HUECO D-4, HUECO D-8
Dear Dr. Howard:
Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for two samples recently sent to us. They each
provided plenty of carbon for accurate measurements and all the analyses proceeded normally. As usual,
the method of analysis is listed on the report with the results and calibration data is provided where
applicable.
You will notice that Beta-262740 (HUECO D-4) is reported with the units âpMCâ rather than BP.
âpMCâ stands for "percent modern carbon". Results are reported in the pMC format when the analyzed
material had more 14C than did the modern (AD 1950) reference standard. The source of this "extra" 14C
in the atmosphere is thermo-nuclear bomb testing which on-set in the 1950s. Its presence generally
indicates the material analyzed was part of a system that was respiring carbon after the on-set of the
testing (AD 1950s). On occasion, the two sigma lower limit will extend into the time region before this
"bomb-carbon" onset (i.e. less than 100 pMC). In those cases, there is some probability for 18th, 19th, or
20th century antiquity.
As always, no students or intern researchers who would necessarily be distracted with other
obligations and priorities were used in the analyses. We analyzed them with the combined attention of
our entire professional staff.
If you have specific questions about the analyses, please contact us. We are always available to
answer your questions.
The cost of the analysis was charged to the MASTERCARD card provided. A receipt is enclosed
with the paper report copy. Thank you. As always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the
results, donât hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,

APPENDIX CâPOLLEN, MACROFLORAL,
AND PHYTOLITH ANALYSES

by Karen Puseman, R. A. Varney, Linda Scott Cummings, and Margaret Howard

In 2003, Paleo Research Institute of Golden, Colorado processed and analyzed three pollen samples
and three macrofloral samples collected from midden deposits at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic
Site during the current investigations. A corncob also was processed to recover phytoliths that have
the potential to yield information on maize race. The report of these analyses (Puseman et al. 2003) is
excerpted here, supplemented by information on the age and context of the samples, and prehistoric
plant use in the region.
Paleo Research Institute determined that these pollen and macrofloral samples were dominated by
wild plants; a few charred Chenopodium spp. seeds constitute limited evidence of wild plant processing.
No remains of Zea mays or other cultivated plants were recovered other than the corn cob, which was
later determined by radiocarbon assay to be modern (see Appendix B).

SAMPLE PREPARATION AND ANALYSES
Pollen
Three of the 11 matrix samples that were collected from midden deposits exposed in shovel test
profiles (see Methods of Archeological Investigations section) were selected for pollen analysis. The
samples from localities CA5 and WS2 were chosen because they were sealed beneath windblown sand
and apparently protected from modern contamination (Table C1). The sample from NE2 was selected
because it was located near Hueco Tanks Village, where remains of cultivated corn and beans had been
recovered (see Hueco Tanks Village section).
To extract the pollen, Paleo Research Institute employed a chemical flotation technique that typically is used to process large volumes of sand, silt, and clay when preservation is less than ideal and
pollen density is low. A 10 percent solution of hydrochloric acid was used to remove calcium carbonates from the sediments, after which they was screened through 150 micron mesh. The samples were
rinsed until neutral by adding water, letting the samples stand for 2 hours, and then pouring off the
supernatant. A small quantity of sodium hexametaphosphate was added to each sample once it reached
neutrality, then the beaker was again filled with water and allowed to stand for 2 hours. The samples
were again rinsed until neutral, filling the beakers only with water; this step was added to remove clay
prior to heavy liquid separation. The samples were then dried and gently pulverized. They were mixed
with sodium polytungstate (density 2.1) and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate the
organic and inorganic remains. The supernatant containing pollen and organic remains was decanted.

Sodium polytungstate was again added to the inorganic fraction to repeat the separation process. The
supernatant was decanted into the same tube as the supernatant from the first separation. This supernatant was then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes to separate any remaining silica from the organics.
Following this, the supernatant was decanted into a 50 ml conical tube and diluted with distilled water.
The samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm to concentrate the organic fraction in the bottom of the tube.
After rinsing the pollen-rich organic fraction obtained by that separation, the samples received a 10 to
15 minute treatment in hot hydrofluoric acid to remove any remaining inorganic particles. The samples
were then acetolated for 3 minutes to remove any extraneous organic matter.
A light microscope was used at a magnification of 500x to count the pollen. Large pollen counts
were obtained due in part to extremely high pollen concentrations and in part to the overwhelming
dominance of pollen from Cheno-ams, a group of plants that include Amaranthus (pigweed) and members of the Chenopodiaceae (goosefoot) family such as Atriplex (saltbush), Chenopodium (goosefoot),
Sarcobatus (greasewood), and Suaeda (seepweed). Samples were counted to a total of between 401 and
410 pollen grains per sample so that at least 100 grains of non-dominant pollen types could be observed
and tabulated, providing better information on local vegetation and potential resources. Pollen preservation in these samples ranged from good to poor. Comparative reference material at the Intermountain
Herbarium at Utah State University and the University of Colorado Herbarium was used to identify the
pollen to the family, genus, and species level as possible.
Aggregated clumps of single types of pollen were recorded during this process; they may represent
pollen dispersal over short distances, or the introduction of parts of those plants into the archeological
context. Aggregates were included in the pollen counts as single grains, as is customary. The presence of
aggregates is noted by an A next to the frequency on the pollen diagram. Pollen diagrams were produced
using the Tilia program, developed by Dr. Eric Grimm of the Illinois State Museum. Pollen concentrations were calculated in Tilia using the quantity (cubic centimeters) of sample processed, the quantity
of exotics (spores) added to the sample, the quantity of exotics counted, and the total pollen counted.
Indeterminate pollen includes pollen grains that are folded, mutilated, and otherwise distorted beyond
recognition. These grains were included in the total count because they are part of the pollen record.

Appendix CâPollen, Macrofloral, and Phytolith Analyses

Macrofloral
Three of the 11 matrix samples collected from midden deposits exposed in shovel tests profiles (see
Methods of Archeological Investigations section) were selected for macrofloral analysis. The samples
from localities CA5 and WS2 were chosen because they were sealed beneath windblown sand and apparently protected from modern contamination (see Table C1). The sample from NW2 was associated with
a radiocarbon assay.
Macrofloral samples were floated using a modification of the procedures outlined by Matthews
(1979). Each sample was added to approximately 3 gallons of water, and stirred until a strong vortex
formed. The floating material (light fraction) was poured through a 150 micron mesh sieve. Additional
water was added and the process repeated a minimum of five times or until all floating material was
removed from the sample. The material that remained at the bottom of the container (heavy fraction)
was poured through a 0.5 mm mesh screen. The floated fractions were allowed to dry.
The light fractions were weighed, and then passed through a graduated series of screens (U.S. standard sieves with 2 mm, 1 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm openings) to separate charcoal and sort the remains
initially. The contents of each screen were then examined. Charcoal pieces caught on these screens were
separated from the rest of the light fraction and weighed. A representative sample of these charcoal
pieces was broken to expose a fresh cross-section, and examined under 70x binocular magnification.
The weight of each charcoal type in the representative sample also was recorded. Material that remained
in the sieves was scanned under a binocular microscope at a magnification of 10x, with some identifications requiring magnification of up to 70x. The material that passed through the 0.25 mm screen was
not examined. The heavy fractions were scanned at a magnification of 2x for the presence of botanical
remains. Remains from the light and heavy fractions were recorded as charred or uncharred, and whole
or fragmentary. The term seed is used to represent seeds, achenes, caryopses, and other disseminules.
Macrofloral remains were identified using manuals (Martin and Barkley 1961; Musil 1963; Schopmeyer
1974) and through comparison with modern and archeological references.
Samples from archeological sites commonly contain both charred and uncharred botanical remains.
Many ethnobotanists consider only charred remains to be prehistoric, unless there is a specific reason to
believe otherwise (Minnis 1981:147). It is improbable that many uncharred seeds survive over prehistoric time spans; few seeds survive longer than a century, and most are viable for much shorter periods
of time (Harrington 1972; Justice and Bass 1978; Minnis 1981:147; Quick 1961). It is presumed that
once seeds have died, decomposing organisms act quickly to decay them. Caves, waterlogged sediments,
and very arid areas can preserve uncharred prehistoric plant remains, however. As the macrofloral samples from Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site were collected from open-air, semiarid contexts, they
are not likely to contain uncharred seeds that date to prehistoric times.
Zea mays Cob Phytoliths
A maize cob collected from the floor of a rockshelter in locality NW2 during the current investigations was submitted for phytolith recovery and recording; radiocarbon assay later determined that it is
modern (see Appendix B). The corncob was sonicated in a mixture of distilled water and dish soap to
remove accumulated sediment and silica. After this cleaning, the cob was placed in a crucible and ashed
in a muffle furnace to reduce the organic and carbon content. The ash was dissolved using concentrated
hydrogen chloride, which was rinsed from the sample after the initial reaction. The sample was then
415

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

treated with Schulze solutionâa mixture of concentrated nitric acid and potassium chlorate. After this
solution was mixed into the sample, it was heated gently and allowed to sit for approximately 30 minutes. The sample was then rinsed using reverse osmosis water, and centrifuged so the supernatant could
be decanted. This step was repeated several times, and then the sample was rinsed with alcohol.
After several alcohol rinses, the sample containing the phytoliths was mounted on a microscope
slide in a mixture of cinnamaldehyde and canola oil. It was examined under a light microscope at a magnification of 500x to discern phytolithsâthree-dimensional silica bodies produced by plants. A sample
of 50 phytoliths was selected and photographed with a digital camera; the lower and upper faces of each
phytolith were then traced by hand over the digital images, generating outlines that could be measured.
Nineteen parameters of the upper and lower faces of the phytoliths were recorded; the averages of those
measurements constitute a numeric signature for the phytoliths.

RESULTS
The pollen records from localities CA5, NE2, and WS2 are overwhelmingly dominated by Chenoams (Figure C1a). The high frequency of this plant group indicates that members of the goosefoot family and/or amaranth were well represented in the vegetation community in the area, and were available
for use by prehistoric occupants. To extract information on other pollen types, Cheno-am pollen was
removed from the sum and a second pollen diagram (Figure C1b) was created, so that fluctuations in
less abundant pollen types could be observed. The pollen samples were scanned for the presence of Zea
mays (corn) pollen, but none was noted. The macrofloral samples from localities CA5, NW2, and WS2
also are dominated by wild plant species, and yielded no evidence of cultivated plants. Minor differences
are evident among the samples from the four localities.
Locality CA5
Pollen sample P-6 and macrofloral sample F-6 were collected from Shovel Test 18, located near a
rockshelter containing imagery in locality CA5. They were obtained from the upper part of a midden
deposit that was sealed beneath windblown sand. Positioned at 33 to 38 cm and 33 to 41 cm below surface respectively, the pollen and macrofloral samples are associated with an El Paso Polychrome ceramic
sherd (A.D. 1000/1100-1450; Miller 1995:212), dating them to the DoÃ±a Ana and/or El Paso phases.
Non-floral specimens recovered from macrofloral sample F-6 include 75 bone fragments, around half
of which are burned. The sample also yielded 12 pieces of chipped stone debitage. Thirty-eight insect
chitin fragments and a few worm casts are natural inclusions.
Pollen sample P-6 is dominated by Cheno-ams, but has the lowest frequency of the three pollen samples (see Figure C1). The sample has higher frequencies of high-spine Asteraceae (including aster, rabbitbrush, snakeweed, sunflower, etc.) and Artemisia (sagebrush) pollen than the other samples. Arboreal
pollen types include Juniperus, Pinus, Prosopis, and Quercus, representing juniper, pine, mesquite, and
oak in the local vegetation. This sample contained the only occurrence of Fouquieria splendens pollen,
indicating the presence of ocotillo not only in the local vegetation, but possibly in the midden. Other
local vegetation represented in this pollen record include Liguliflorae, Opuntia, Eriogonum, Liliaceae,
Rhamnaceae, and Rosaceae, indicating the presence of members of the chicory tribe of the Asteraceae
family, prickly pear cactus, wild buckwheat, a member of the lily family (not yucca), buckthorn, and a
member of the rose family. Although most of these plants have economic uses, their representation in

Appendix CâPollen, Macrofloral, and Phytolith Analyses

Quercus charcoal, indicating creosotebush, mesquite, and oak wood burned as fuel. Small fragments of
an unidentified diffuse porous hardwood with fairly large rays also were present; their morphology is
similar to sycamore (Platanus), although that tree does not grow in the region. One uncharred Sporobolus
caryopsis represents modern dropseed grass.
Three charred Chenopodium seeds and two fragments were recovered from the macrofloral sample,
suggesting that goosefoot seeds were processed at locality CA5. This weedy annual establishes itself
rapidly in disturbed areas (Fernald 1950:592-596; Kirk 1975:56-57; Martin 1972:44-45; Sweet 1976:48).
Five species of goosefoot are part of the modern biota at Hueco Tanks: Chenopodium atrovirens, C. berlandieri, C. cycloides, C. desiccatum, and C. incanum (Worthington 1996:18-19).
Chenopodium plants produce edible parts from early spring (greens) through fall (seeds) (Harrington 1967:55-62, 69-71, 80-82, 234-236; 1972:68-71, 82-84; Kirk 1975:56-63; Sweet 1976:48; Tilford
1997:14-15, 88-89). Cooked Chenopodium leaves contain over three times the calcium of cooked spinach, and more Vitamin A and C (Kindscher 1987:82; Watt and Merrill 1963:37, 59). The plants also
produce large quantities of seeds that can be harvested in the late summer and fall. Chenopodium seeds
are volumetrically equivalent to corn in terms of calories, but have significantly more protein and fat
(Asch and Asch 1978:304).
Chenopod/amaranth was one of the most frequently represented plants in macrobotanical samples
from early and late Mesilla phase occupations at Turquoise Ridge (41EP762), located 6.5 miles westnorthwest of Hueco Tanks (Whalen 1994:118-119). In the central Hueco Bolson, evidence of Chenopodium seed processing was found at site 41EP3173, where over 50 charred seeds (most broken) were
recovered in a macrofloral sample from the floor of a Mesilla phase pithouse occupied between ca. A.D.
470 and 790 (Leach et al. 1996).
Locality NE2
Pollen sample P-9 was collected from Shovel Test 23, located near a rockshelter that contains prehistoric imagery and historic inscriptions in locality NE2. Obtained between 6 and 10 cm below surface in
the upper part of a midden deposit, the sample is associated with an El Paso Polychrome ceramic sherd
(A.D. 1000/1100â1450; Miller 1995:212) and an arrow point fragment (A.D. 850â1450; see Materials
Recovered section), dating it to the late Mesilla, DoÃ±a Ana, and/or El Paso phase. The sample locus is
near a group of structures built during the DoÃ±a Ana phase (A.D. 1000â1300) and occupied by groups
who cultivated limited quantities of corn and beans (see Hueco Tanks Village section). The shovel test
also produced glass and ceramic fragments, metal, aluminum foil, and plastic, indicating that the area
had been disturbed during historic and modern times.
Although the pollen record for sample P-9 (see Figure C1) is dominated by Cheno-am plants, other
major vegetation types are Poaceae (grasses) and high-spine Asteraceae (sunflower family). Arboreal
pollen types are similar to those in the sample from CA5, and include Juniperus, Pinus, Prosopis, and
Quercus, representing juniper, pine, mesquite, and oak. Pollen from potential economic plants in this
sample includes Liguliflorae, Mammillaria-type, Opuntia, Eriogonum, Liliaceae, and Poaceae, representing local members of the chicory tribe of the sunflower family; pincushion, hedgehog, or barrel cactus;
prickly pear cactus; wild buckwheat; a member of the lily family (not yucca, which produces much
larger pollen); and grasses. The low frequencies of these pollen types do not indicate that any of these
plants were processed and discarded in the midden; many of them are either weedy or flourish in disturbed sediments.

10,000 Years at Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site

Locality NW2
Macrofloral sample F-11 was collected from Shovel Test 26, located near a rockshelter containing
imagery in locality NW2. Positioned between 20 and 22 cm below surface in the upper part of a midden deposit, the sample lies 10 cm below an undifferentiated El Paso painted ceramic sherd that dates
between A.D. 800/1000 and 1450 (Miller 1995:212). It is 20 cm above the base of the midden, where
charcoal was dated via radiocarbon assay to a span of A.D. 670 to 1010, falling almost entirely within
the Mesilla phase (see Appendix B). The midden deposit also contained a few historic artifacts, probably
introduced by animal burrowing. Sample F-11 consisted of 2.3 liters of sediment; after flotation, the
light fraction weighed 48.33 g. Non-floral specimens recovered from macrofloral sample F-11 include
180 bone fragments (most of which are charred) and 10 eggshell fragments. Chipped stone debitage is
abundant (n = 93). Historic/modern items are a small glass fragment and a probable plastic fragment.
Insect chitin fragments and a few worm casts are natural inclusions.
The sample contained several small fragments of Larrea tridentata and Prosopis charcoal (see Table
C2), indicating that creosotebush and mesquite wood were burned as fuel. Single small fragments of
Juniperus and Pinus charcoal reflect burning of juniper and pine wood. Juniperus coahuilensis (roseberry
juniper) is part of the modern biota at Hueco Tanks; Pinus edulis (Colorado pinyon) and Pinus remota
(Texas pinyon) have been recovered from packrat middens at the Tanks and in the Hueco Mountains,
but no longer grow in the area (Van Devender and Riskind 1979:139; Worthington 1996:11). Uncharred
seeds identified as Amaranthus, Celtis, Chenopodium, Datura, Larrea tridentata, Oryzopsis, Sphaeralcea,
Sporobolus, and Trianthema portulacastrum indicate that amaranth/pigweed, hackberry, goosefoot, jimsonweed, creosotebush, Indian ricegrass, globemallow, dropseed, and desert horse purslane are components of the modern vegetation community, and most likely were introduced by burrowing animals.
A corncob (sample PH-1) was recovered in locality NW2 from the surface of a rockshelter that
contains imagery. It was processed to recover phytoliths, which were then measured from tracings of
digital photographs. Radiocarbon assay later determined that the cob is modern (see Appendix B). The
phytoliths from this corncob were relatively large, with significant differences in the size of their upper
and lower faces. Average size of phytoliths is interpreted to represent growing conditions, while average
shape parameters may represent genetic relationships such as race. The measurements of these phytoliths are on file in the Archeology Laboratory of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department in Austin.
Locality WS2
Pollen sample P-4 and macrofloral sample F-4 were recovered from Shovel Test 13, located near a
cluster of fire-cracked rock features in Locality WS2. Obtained from the top of a midden deposit sealed
beneath windblown sand, the samples were taken at depths of 32 to 36 cm and 32 to 45 cm below surface, respectively. The shovel test produced no ceramics but yielded a dart point fragment between 40
and 50 cm below surface that dates generally to the Archaic period (6000 B.C. to A.D. 200; see Prehistoric Background section). Non-floral specimens from macrofloral sample F-4 include 39 bone fragments, most of which are charred. The sample also yielded 27 pieces of chipped stone debitage. Insect
chitin fragments (n = 67) and numerous worm casts are natural inclusions.
The pollen record for this sample is similar to that found in the samples from CA5 and NE2. A
community dominated by Cheno-ams (goosefoot family and amaranths) has a fairly strong secondary
representation of high-spine Asteraceae (includes aster, rabbitbrush, snakeweed, sunflower, etc.) and
420

Appendix CâPollen, Macrofloral, and Phytolith Analyses

Poaceae (grasses). Arboreal pollen from sample P-4 includes Juniperus, Pinus, and Quercus, reflecting
junipers, pines, and oaks growing in the area. Although there is no indication of human plant use in the
sample, potentially useful plants include Opuntia, Eriogonum, and Poaceae, representing prickly pear
cactus, wild buckwheat, and grasses.
Macrofloral sample F-4 consisted of 2.3 liters of sediment recovered from the midden deposit; after
flotation, the light fraction weighed 57.21 g. It yielded small fragments of Atriplex, Larrea tridentata,
and Prosopis charcoal, indicating that saltbush, creosotebush, and mesquite wood were burned as fuel.
One fragment of charred conifer bark suggests that a conifer such as juniper or pine also was burned.
A small fragment of unidentified knot wood charcoal is slightly vitrified, its shiny, glassy appearance
due to fusion by heat. Recovery of slightly vitrified charcoal might indicate that the wood was burned
when its sap content was higher than dry wood. A few charred insect fecal pellets suggest that some of
the burned wood contained insects. Uncharred seeds identified as Caryophyllaceae, Chenopodium, and
Cuscuta indicate that members of the pink family, goosefoot, and dodder are components of the modern vegetation community, and probably were introduced by burrowing animals.

CONCLUSIONS
Pollen and macrofloral analysis of midden deposits in four localities at Hueco Tanks State Park and
Historic Site yielded limited information concerning the plant resources utilized in prehistoric times.
Neither the pollen nor the macrofloral record evidenced use of cultivated plants or intensive plant processing. A few charred goosefoot seeds in the macrofloral sample from locality CA5 are the only indication of limited wild plant processing.
The pollen record in the samples from localities CA5, NE2, and WS2 is dominated by Cheno-ams,
indicating that goosefoot, other members of the goosefoot family, and/or perhaps the genus Amaranthus were very common in the local vegetation. Strong secondary associations in the pollen record are
the Asteraceae (sunflower) family and grasses. While several potentially useful economic plants appear
in the pollen, they are not present in quantities that indicate processing and discard of those plants.
The macrofloral samples from localities CA5, NW2, and WS2 primarily contain fragments of charcoal from trees and woody shrubs. Larrea tridentata and Prosopis charcoal were found in all three samples, suggesting that creosotebush and mesquite were available in the immediate area and commonly
used as fuel. Pine and juniper charcoal are represented in the sample from NW2. A piece of burned
conifer bark from WS2 could be juniper or pinyon, though the latter no longer grows in the region.
Saltbush charcoal was found at WS2, and this member of the Cheno-am family might have contributed
large quantities of Cheno-am pollen to the sample from that locality. Oak charcoal was limited to the
sample from CA5.

APPENDIX DâVERTEBRATE FAUNAL REMAINS

by Brian S. Shaffer

Vertebrate remains recovered from Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site were analyzed for the
purposes of identification, assessment of taphonomy, and detection of possible cultural patterns. The
sample consisted of 157 specimens collected from shovel tests during the current investigations and 8
specimens from the park collection (see Methods of Archeological Investigations section). Given the
small size of the sample, little can be inferred with regard to cultural patterns.

METHODS
Specimens were analyzed using the Zooarchaeological Research Collection at the University of
North Texas for comparative identification. Each specimen was identified to the most specific taxon
possible, given its condition (size and preservation) and identifiable attributes, and in light of the comparative material available and the analystâs skill. Specimens identified to the level of Order or below
were labeled on tags. The attributes of each specimen were recorded and tabulated using a faunal analysis coding system (Shaffer and Baker 1992), and the data were exported into Microsoft Excel. Aside from
provenience, attributes recorded included taxon, element, portion of element, side, weathering, breakage, burning, and chemical etching; unique observations were recorded in a comments field.
The number of identified specimens (NISP) is the raw specimen count, while the minimum number of individuals (MNI) is the minimum number of individual animals that could have contributed
to the sample for each taxon. The simplest method of MNI calculation is to find duplicates of elements
or portions of elements. For example, 19 cottontail rabbit specimens were present in this sample. Each
cottontail has one right maxilla (upper jaw bone). Two right maxillae were recovered, and are the only
duplicate elements in terms of side and portion; therefore, the sample MNI for cottontail rabbit is two.
Teeth were counted as separate elements in NISP and MNI calculations.
MNI calculations are influenced by factors like the specificity of element (and portion) identification, and how the sample is aggregated. The faunal analysis coding system employed for these analyses
(Shaffer and Baker 1992) allows for recording specific parts of elements. MNI was calculated at two
levels of aggregation: the sample was treated as a single unit, and the six areas of Hueco Tanks State Park
and Historic Site (CA, ES, NE, NW, SB, and WS) were treated as autonomous aggregates. MNI generally
rises as the number of aggregates increases, because presence of a single element in an aggregate will
result in an MNI of one for that aggregate. In this case, when the sample is considered as six aggregates
there are no duplicate cottontail remains in any of the aggregates, but cottontails are present in five of
the six areas, resulting in an MNI of five.

TAXONOMIC REPRESENTATION
This sample of vertebrate remains is dominated by small fragments; 38 percent of the specimens
can only be identified as Vertebrata, because they are too small to be morphologically associated with
particular animals (Table D1). Even when the sample is aggregated by area the MNI numbers remain
small. No fish or amphibian remains were identified.

Four non-mammalian taxa were identified: three are reptilian and one is avian. The reptiles are box
turtle (and unidentifiable turtle shell fragments), colubrid or non-poisonous snake, and pitviper snake.
The single bird is a subadult turkey represented by a tibiotarsus shaft and unfused distal epiphysis that
refit, recovered from Shovel Test 16 in CA4; radiocarbon assay later determined that these bones are
modern (see Appendix B).
Identifiable mammalian remains are dominated by leporids, most notably cottontail rabbits,
although some jackrabbit remains also were recovered. Three rodent elements were recovered, two of
which are wood rat. The rest of the identifiable remains are from artiodactyls including deer, cattle/
bison, and sheep/goat.

TAPHONOMY
The taphonomic attributes noted in the sample are breakage, cut marks, weathering, burning, and
chemical etching (Table D2). In terms of breakage, specimens were classified as unbroken, angularly
426

Appendix DâVertebrate Faunal Remains

broken (no collagen present or specimens
not capable of spiral fracturing), or spirÂ­
ally fractured (capable of spiral fracÂ­
turing and broken while collagen was
still present). Typically, elements capable
of spiral fracturing have thicker cortical
bone, and include long bone shafts and
portions of the pelvis, ribs, scapulae,
manÂ­dibles, and some vertebral processes.
Flat bones that are incapable of spiral
fracturing include the cranium, sternum,
blades of the scapula and pelvis, the
majority of rib bones, and most podials
and vertebral centra. Most fish bones and
turtles shells do not fracture spirally.

breakage is assumed to be intentional, or

162
when intentional breakage is evidenced
by dynamic impact fractures (Johnson
1985). Spiral breakage also may occur incidentally while processing a carcass for meat, fat, sinew, or
other resources. Dynamic loading impact fractures are found primarily on long bone shafts when the
bone has been struck by a hammerstone or similar object (Johnson 1985); no such fractures were noted
in the sample. Without direct evidence of intentional breakageâand due to the small sample sizeâno
conclusions can be drawn about breakage and cultural behavior.
Definite cultural behavior was evidenced on four bones that have cut marks. Three exhibit metal
saw marks and are identified as historic or modern. Hand sawing was evident on a small/mediumsized mammal bone fragment from Shovel Test 30 in NE4 and a sheep/goat radius in the park collection from CA5, and band sawing was noted on a deer/bison-sized mammal rib in the park collection
from CA5. Hand sawing was identified based on the presence of irregularly spaced and oriented but
mostly parallel cut marks traversing the cut surface. Persons who hand saw tend to rock the saw, causing the orientation of the striae to be non-uniform. Band saw marks exhibit uniform parallel spacing
across the cut surface.
The fourth cut specimen is the proximal end of a deer radius in the park collection from CA7
that exhibits a groove and snap fracture near the mid-shaft. In this process, a sharp tool is used to cut
a groove around the circumference of the bone until it is deep enough that the bone may be snapped
along the groove. Unfortunately, weathering on the cut end of this bone has degraded it to the point that
the tool used for cutting (i.e., stone tool or metal knife) cannot be ascertained, though evidence of the
groove and hinge fracture are present.
Burning is another taphonomic factor associated with human activity, but also may result from
natural wildfires. Burning was classified as charred (brown or black) or calcined (white). Charring is
incomplete combustion of bone; calcination is more complete combustion of bone through exposure to
intense heat or extended exposure to flame. Only 31 percent of the sample showed evidence of burning,

and most of the specimens were charred rather than calcined (see Table D2). Burned bones were not
concentrated in any particular area.
Weathering is damage to bone through exposure to the elementsâespecially surface exposureâ
and was recorded as light or marked. Specimens exhibiting marked weathering are extensively bleached,
and exhibit fine-line fracturing, transverse fracturing, and planar flaking, indicative of bone disintegration as a result of exposure. For example, the band-sawed mammal rib from CA5 exhibited marked
weathering and extensive cracking.
Chemical etching appeared to be incidental, and was noted on only three specimens: two from
Shovel Test 12 in WS2, and one from Shovel Test 22 in NE1. No agent could be identified as the cause of
the etching, but likely sources include roots, sediment pH, and gastric juices. No gnawing was identified
in the sample, although it is commonly found on bones from archeological sites. Rodent and carnivore
gnawing typically are most common, but neither of these taphonomic factors was evident.
One specimen exhibited an unusual taphonomy. The grooved and snapped deer radius in the park
collection from CA7 had marked weathering on the cut end of the bone, but not on the opposite end.
The protected end of the bone also retained collagen. This indicates that the uncut end of the bone was
protected from the elements by burial.

DISCUSSION
This sample of vertebrate remains from Hueco Tanks State Park and Historic Site is dominated by
small taxa, most notably leporids and reptiles. Aside from fragmentation, the assemblage is fairly well
preserved despite being affected by weathering, burning, and chemical etching. Fragmentation was a
significant factor in reduction of the assemblage; only six complete specimens were recovered, five of
which were snake vertebrae and the sixth a cottontail calcaneus (heel bone). Most certainly, fragmentation hindered the identification of the majority of specimens in the sample.
Definitive evidence of cultural behavior is limited to four specimens. Three have saw marks that are
historic or modern. One grooved and snapped deer radius is weathered to the extent that the tool used
for cutting (i.e., stone tool or metal knife) cannot be discerned.
