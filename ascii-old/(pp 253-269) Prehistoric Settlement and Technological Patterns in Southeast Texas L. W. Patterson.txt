Prehistoric Settlement and Technological Patterns in
Southeast Texas
L. W. Patterson

ABSTRACT
Prehistoric settlement, subsistence, and technological patterns are discussed for the
upper Texas coast and a western transitional zone between the Brazos and Colorado
rivers. External relationships are considered from the standpoint of technological traits.
Stable settlement patterns are indicated for long spans of time in the inland portions of
these regions.

INTRODUCTION
Settlement and technological patterns are key subjects in the study of prehistoric lifeways. Data for the study of these subjects in Southeast Texas have
increased significantly in the past few years. A general review of the prehistory
of the upper Texas coast has been published previously by the author (Patterson
1979a). This current paper provides more details on settlement and technological
patterns, including some data not previously available.
This study explores differences in prehistoric settlement and technological
patterns in two specific geographical areas of the Southeast Texas coastal plain:
the upper Texas coast, defined as the area between the Brazos and Sabine rivers,
from the coastal margin to approximately 90 miles inland; and the zone between
the Colorado and Brazos rivers, which extends about the same distance inland as
the upper Texas coast (Figure 1).
Many similarities as well as differences are evident in cultural patterns of
the two regions. Settlement patterns seem to be closely tied to available food
resources, while technological patterns may be influenced by several factors,
such as subsistence requirements, cultural preferences, availability of raw materials, and external influences.
CHRONOLOGY
The current literature on archeological research tends to deemphasize studies on prehistoric chronology in favor of more narrowly defined problems. It
should be realized, however, that precise definition of chronology remains an important research goal in most parts of the state, including Southeast Texas. Explicit problem-oriented studies in prehistoric archeology cannot be done properly
without supporting chronological data.
Establishing precise chronological controls for Southeast Texas is difficult.
Few of the materials that are normally recovered are suitable for radiocarbon dat-

ing, and neither ceramic nor projectile point studies have as yet yielded definitive
data concerning precise, narrow time periods. In addition, much field work remains to be done before sufficient data to define relative chronologies of artifact
types for all prehistoric time periods is available. Enough data exist, however, to
construct relative chronologies for broad time periods in Southeast Texas. A few
radiocarbon dates are now available, and a fairly good definition of the beginning
dates for ceramics has been established on the coastal margin of the upper Texas
coast.
A large number of prehistoric sites have now been recorded in Southeast
Texas (Patterson 1979a:Table 1); however, most of the data from these sites are
from surface collections. For this large body of information to be useful, it is
necessary to use projectile point and ceramic typologies as time indicators. Although much research remains to be done, tentative projectile point sequences
can be constructed for the two regions under discussion, as shown in Table 1.
These proposed point type sequences are based on data from a few excavated
sites that have long occupation sequences. The principal sites involved are 41AU 1
(Duke 1982) and 41AU36 (Hall 1981) in Austin County, and 41HR5 (Wheat
1953 :Table 5) and 4 ! HR315 (Patterson 1980a) in Harris County. Data from several other excavated sites in the upper Texas coast also are available, mainly for
the Late Archaic and later periods. These include sites in Austin (Hall 1981),
Brazoria (Aten 1971), Chambers (Aten 1979, 1983), Harris (Aten !979, 1983;
OâBrien 1971; Wheat 1953), Liberty (Aten t967), Montgomery (Shafer 1958),

and Polk (McClurkan 1958) counties. New data from excavated site 41WH19
(L.W. Patterson field notes, n.d.) in Wharton County also will be discussed here.
The early Paleo-Indian period is not well represented in Southeast Texas.
There are a few surface finds of Clovis fluted points (Long 1977; Suhm and Jetks
1962; Wheat 1953) and a Clovis point associated with the Galena site in Harris
County (Hester 1980). Only one example of a Folsom-type fluted point has been
found in this region (site 41WH19). The early Paleo-Indian period is generally
recognized as extending from 12,000 to 10,000 B.P. (Jennings 1974:Fig. 3.27).
It is now known that side-notched projectile points occur in very early sites
in Central and Southeast Texas. There are three occurrences of side-notched
points earlier than Plainview in these regions. In Central Texas these examples
include a San Patrice point on the upper Brazos River (Watt 1978) and other sidenotched point varieties at the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235 ; Frank Weir, personal communication, n.d.) north of Austin. In Southeast Texas, at site 41WH 19,
three varieties of side-notched points have been found in levels below a Plainview
point, one at the same level as a Folsom point. The side-notched point at the
Folsom level at site 41WH19 is somewhat comparable in time to the earliest
dates for Dalton side-notched points during the Folsom time period (Goodyear
1982). The scarcity of Folsom points in Southeast Texas may thus be explained in
terms of other point types being used in this region during the period I0,000 to
11,000 years ago.
Since the early Paleo-Indian period is not yet well defined in Southeast
Texas, this article will deal primarily with late Paleo-Indian and later time
periods for which significant data are now available. The late Paleo-Indian period covers an interval of 10,000 to 7,000 years ago, based on the date summary
of Plainview and Golondrina point types given by Johnson and Holliday (1980).
Scottsbluff and Angostura point types fall into this time range (Prewitt 198!:
Figure 4). Other late Paleo-Indian point types found in Southeast Texas include
Dalton, Meserve, and San Patrice. As Story (1981:143) has noted, the San
Patrice point type may date from early in the late Paleo-Indian period on the
upper Brazos River (Watt 1978) and in the Texas Panhandle (Willey et al. 1978).
Distribution of the San Patrice point type in Texas is becoming better known.
This point type has a wide distribution in Southeast Texas (Patterson 1980b), and
more examples are being found in Central Texas (Watt 1978; Weber 1980). A San
Patrice point has been found in situ in late Paleo-Indian context at site 41WH 19
(L. W. Patterson field notes, n.d.) in Wharton County.
A surprising variety of stemmed point types has been found for the late
Paleo-lndian period at site 41WH t 9. Straight-stemmed, site-notched, and cornernotched varieties all occur at this site below an Angostura point and above a
Plainview point. Most of these points have well-ground basal edges. Based on
excavations at site 41HR315 (Patterson 1980a: Table 3), early straight-stemmed
points occur in late Paleo-lndian period contexts in Harris County. Early sideand corner-notched points also may occur in Harris County in late Paleo-lndian
period components, based on excavations by Wheat ( 1953 :Types 7, 14) and surface collections such as those from site 41HR206 (Patterson 1976c:Figure IA-C;
1980d:Figures IE, 2G, 2H).
Using information provided by McCormick (1975) and W. W. Crook, Jr.
(personal communication, n.d.) for north-central Texas, I now feel that the

Patterson--Southeast Texas

257

Carrollton and Trinity point types start in the Early Archaic and continue through
the Middle Archaic period on the upper Texas coast. These point types have not
yet been found in the western transitional zone (Figure 1) but are common in the
upper Texas coast. Bell-like points may date from the Early Archaic period in the
western transitional zone (Patterson and Hudgins 1981 :Figure 1). The Bulverde
point type seems to start in the Early or Middle Archaic in the upper Texas coast
(Patterson 1980a) and in the western transitional zone (site 41AU 1, Duke 1982).
This point type continues into the Late Archaic in the upper Texas coast (Patterson
1980a). The Gary/Kent point series starts in the Middle Archaic period in both
the upper Texas coast and the western transitional zone and continues throughout
all later prehistoric periods (Hall 1981; Patterson 1980a). Other point types associated with the Middle Archaic period in the western transitional zone include
Travis, Pedernales, Marcos, Lange, Ensor, and Wells (Hall 1981). Pedernales
and Williams point types may also be associated with the Middle Archaic in the
upper Texas coast. In contrast to Prewittâs (1981 :Figure 4) Central Texas chronology, the Pedernales point type continues into the terminal Archaic in the upper Texas coast (Wheat 1975:Table 5) and in the western transitional zone (site
41AU1, Duke 1982). The Early to Middle Archaic period in this region is estimated at roughly 7,000 to 3,500 B.P. (Patterson 1979a: 106). Some unclassified
straight-stemmed points with ground basal edges have been found in the Early
Archaic level of site 41WH19.
The Late Archaic period in the upper Texas coast is defined here as beginning at approximately 3,500 B.P. and ending with the introduction of ceramics at about 1,900 B.P. (Aten et al. 1975:Figure 16). The introduction of ceramics is not well defined in the western transitiona! zone. The Early Ceramic
(Woodland) period starts at about 1,900 B.P. and ends at about 1,400 B.P., when
small bifacial arrow point types become predominant (Aten 1971:Figure 10).
Dart point styles are similar throughout the Late Archaic and Early Ceramic
periods in the study area. These include Gary/Kent, Ellis, Ensor, Ponchartrain,
Palmillas, Darl, Yarbrough, Wells, and Pedernales. Marcos and Fairland point
types also occur during these time periods, but only in the western transitional
zone. Transitional arrow point types occur during these time periods in both
regions (Patterson 1982a).
The Late Prehistoric period is defined here as starting at about 1,400 B.C.
and ending with European contact at 500 B.P. Research to date, except for a
study of ceramic types on the coastal margin (Aten et al. 1976:Figure 16), has
not enabled definition of any subperiods within the Late Prehistoric. Standardized small arrow point types such as Alba, Perdiz, Scallorn, Edwards, and Catahoula are predominant during this time period. It should be noted that the Gary/
Kent dart point series continues into the Late Prehistoric throughout the study
areas (Wheat 1953:Table 5; Hall 1981; Patterson 1980a:Table 3, Aten 1979), especially at inland sites.
Much research remains to be done to obtain more exact ordering of chronologies in these two regions. Few absolute dates are available, and projectile
point sequences are not fully delined. Materials suitable for radiocarbon dating
are not found frequently. Some projectile point types are not suitable for defining
narrow time periods, and there appear to be geographical differences in pottery
type sequences. On the positive side; the amount of data available for the two

258

Texas Archeological Society

regions is increasing rapidly (Patterson 1982b). More research is especially
needed on projectile point sequences in the Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic
periods. Site 4 IWH 19 has the potential to yield radiocarbon dates for a very long
time sequence.
SITE OCCUPATION SEQUENCES
The major prehistoric settlement pattern of the inland coastal plain in the
upper Texas coast and the western transitional zone is the dense occupation
found near all water sources. It has been known for some time that Indian sites
are generally found along stream banks or on the first high terraces above the
stream banks (Patterson 1979a, 1979c). Recent data indicate a large number of
sites on stable landforms that have very long occupation sequences. A number of
sites have initial occupations in the Late Paleo-Indian or Early Archaic periods
with continued intermittent occupations through the Late Prehistoric. A stable
settlement pattern lasting for as long as 10,000 years may be indicated for some
of these sites. One of the reasons for the uniformity in settlement patterns is
the lack of topographical and geological diversity. There were few opportunities
to practice a variety of settlement strategies, such as use of caves or hilltop lookout sites.
A number of sites with long occupation sequences in Wharton County, in
the western transitional zone, have now been reported. Sites 41WH2 (Patterson
and Hudgins 1980a; Patterson 1980c), 41WH7 (Patterson and Hudgins 1980a),
41WH10 (Patterson and Hudgins 1980b), 41WH19 Location A (Patterson and
Hudgins 1981) and 41WH26 (Patterson and Hudgins 1982) have late PaleoIndian components indicated by point types such as San Patrice, Plainview,
Scottsbluff, and Golondrina. With only one exception (41WH7), all of these
sites exhibit intermittent use through the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods.
Excavations at site 41WH19 Location B have demonstrated a very long occupation sequence, starting with the early Paleo-Indian period (Folsom) and continuing through the Late Prehistoric (L. W. Patterson field notes, n.d.). Other sites of
the western transitional zone having great time depth include sites 41AU1 (Duke
1982), 41AU7 (Patterson 1976a), 41AU 19 and 41AU36 (Hall 1981), and 41WH65
(Patterson and Hudgins 1983).
A number of sites in the upper Texas coast with long occupation sequences
also are known. Long (1977) has shown that the McFadden Beach area in Jefferson County was utilized from the early Paleo-lndian through at least the Late
Archaic periods. Paleo-Indian points here include Clovis, Dalton, San Patrice,
and Scottsbluff. This area was possibly grassland before coastal subsidence.
Most of the recorded sites in the upper Texas coast with long occupation
sequences are in Harris County, mainly because so much archeological work has
been done there. Site 41HR315 (Patterson 1980a) is an excavated site with the
longest occupation sequence found to date (Paleo-lndian through Late Prehistoric). Plainview, Angostura, and San Patrice are the earliest point types of
this site, and Carrollton points from the Early to Middle Archaic constitute a
major component here.
There are a number of repeatedly occupied, but disturbed, sites in Harris
County with surface collections that include late Paleo-Indian and later artifacts.
Site 41HR182 (Patterson 1975a, and field notes, n.d.) yielded a late Paleo-Indian

Patterson--Southeast Texas

259

Golondrina-like point as well as Archaic and Late Prehistoric materials. The occupation sequence at site 41HR206 (Patterson 1980d) begins with a possible
Angostura point and continues through the Late Prehistoric. As noted previously,
notched points with ground basal edges from this site (Patterson 1976c:Figure
1A-C) may be from the late Paleo-Indian period, based on similar point types
from this period at site 41WH19. Aten et at. (1976), Duke (1971), Hester
(1980), McClure (!977, !978, 1981), McGuff and Cox (1973), and Wheat
(1953) have reported sites containing similar long occupation sequences
Excavations by Wheat (1953) at the Doering site (41HR5) in Harris County
have yielded projectile point types of all time periods. Late Paleo-Indian point
types here include Angostura, Scottsbluff, San Patrice, and Plainview. This site
has been difficult to interpret stratigraphically because some point types seem to
be out of sequence. However, one problem with this site, the occurrence of
notched points at the lowest excavation level, may now be solved. These cornerand side-notched points are similar to types found at the late Paleo-Indian level at
Site 41WHI9.
If Carrollton and Trinity points were being manufactured in the Early Archaic in Harris County, some sites can now be classified as having occupation
sequences starting with the Early Archaic and continuing through the late Prehistoric periods. These sites include 41HR184 (L.W. Patterson field notes, n.d.)
and 41HR283 (McClure 1982).
Since it has now been shown that the Gary/Kent point series begins in the
Middle Archaic, it is likely that the lengths of occupation periods have been underestimated in published reports for some sites in the upper Texas Coast, perhaps
including certain sites in Montgomery (Shafer 1968) and in Polk (McClurkan
1968) counties. It should also be noted that McClurkan refers to site 41PK88 as
starting in the Late Archaic, even though San Patrice and lanceolate Paleo-lndian
points were found at this site.
SETTLEMENT PATTERNS
No complex settlement patterns have been identified for inland portions of
these coastal plain areas. The concept of large base camps with smaller related
specialty sites does not seem to apply here. However, the concept of small bands
gathering on a seasonal basis is a possibility that deserves continued research.
There is evidence of more intensive use of the coastal margin of the upper
Texas coast, in the form of shell middens, starting some time in the later part of
the Archaic period. While some of these sites have Late Archaic remains, most
shell middens are post-ceramic, dating after A.D. 100 (Patterson 1979a:Table 2).
There is a trend toward greater exploitation of marine resources during the Late
Prehistoric period in the coastal margin. Since this trend appears to be accompanied by pottery types somewhat related to Louisiana types (Aten and Bollick
1969), this change in settlement and subsistence patterns may be due to influences from the east. Although not regionally uniform, this trend toward greater
utilization of marine food sources occurs also in some inland areas, such as along
the Brazos River (Hall 1981). The relationships of settlement and subsistence
patterns will be discussed in more detail below.
Sites tend to be smaller and more numerous and to contain less pottery in
the inland upper Texas coast in the Late Prehistoric. This trend has previously

260

Texas Archeological Society

been explained as resulting from a more mobile life style (Patterson 1976c). At
the same time, the basic selection of settlement locations along streams did not
change. Thus, the nature of inland sites differs from that of Late Prehistoric sites
in the coastal margin. Some of the late sites in the coastal margin, such as site
41HR74 (Duke 1981) at Laporte, are quite large and contain large quantities of
pottery. Here, a less mobile life style is indicated, although some seasonal movement probably still occurred.
Judging from numbers of sites, there appear to have been continuing population increases in the upper Texas coast from the late Paleo-Indian through the
Late Prehistoric periods (Patterson 1979a:Table 1). As Story (1981:144) notes,
the highest rate in population increase occurred during the Late Archaic. However, this population increase may not have been as sudden as past data have indicated. An increasing number of sites with Middle Archaic components are now
being identified.
Story (1981:148) notes a general lack of settlement pattern data in East
Texas. This is no longer true for the two regions being discussed here. Much of
the archeological data available for these two regions have now been published
(Patterson 1982b) and, including the data from surface collections, are of good
contextual quality. Many of the surface collections constitute quantifiable samples
of archeological remains and do not simply represent isolated surface finds.
While a more detailed picture of settlement patterns in coastal areas may result
from future research, it is now possible to delineate settlement patterns to a large
degree. Future research should concentrate on more uniform surveys of these
regions (Patterson 1979c) and on obtaining a better description of seasonal
movements.
In spite of the available data, some difficulties in the study of settlement
patterns in these regions do exist. Because of the scarcity of absolute dates and
the inaccuracies of radiocarbon dating, quantified data on archeological sites
cannot be used to determine settlement density at any given moment in time.
Therefore, site density data can be used only as an average over selected time
periods. The interpretation of site size is another difficult subject. A horizontally
large site may represent either a short-term occupation by a large group or frequent use by small groups. Some of the larger sites on the upper Texas coast,
such as 41HR206 (Patterson 1980d), appear to represent frequent occupations
over long time periods by small bands. The scarcity of preserved floral and
faunal remains makes the study of seasonal habitation patterns another difficult
problem. Because of difficulties in obtaining solutions to some types of interpretive problems, future research should concentrate on the types of problems
most amenable to solution.
SUBSISTENCE PATTERNS
Settlement patterns alone have little meaning if not related to subsistence
patterns. In hunting and gathering lifeways, the availability of natural food resources is a prime consideration in the location of habitation sites. The location
of sites near freshwater sources provides access to both potable water and plant
and animal food resources. In the upper Texas coast and in the western transitional zone, settlement patterns seem to be tied directly to strategies of maximizing the available food resources. An area resident recalls that early settlers in

Patterson--Southeast Texas

261

Wharton County referred to the nomadic Indians there as "fish eaters," an indication that Indian activities usually concentrated on local creeks and rivers (Joe
Hudgins, personal communication, n.d.).
Prehistoric Indians in these regions followed a very broad-based subsistence
pattern, exploiting practically any natural resource that was edible. Few floral
remains are available for study, and a large number of sites dating from all time
periods have yielded primarily deer and turtle. However, in the few cases where
large samples of faunal remains have been obtained, it is apparent that a wide
variety of animal foods were used (Hall 1981; Dillehay 1975; Wheat 1953:
Table 8; McClure 1983; Duke 1981).
Both large and small animals were exploited. Large animals included bear,
bison, deer, and antelope. Some of the small animals included rabbit, squirrel,
mink, turtle, raccoon, and rat. The foraging Indians appear to have been practically omnivorous, although there were some food types that were either preferred or easier to obtain. Reptile and fish remains are common mainly at coastal
margin sites, although this may be a matter of selective preservation, since the
alkaline conditions of shell middens are conducive to good bone preservation.
Alligator and garfish are examples of marine food remains that have been found
in archeological sites in these regions. An example of Late Prehistoric inland use
of alligator has been found at site 41WH19.
Even though freshwater shellfish are found near many inland archeologica!
sites, this food resource was not an important factor in the subsistence regimes of
prehistoric groups. Parmalee and Klippel (1974) have given reasons why freshwater shellfish would not have been a preferred food resource in terms of available ~bod energy. In some selective inland areas, the use of shellfish was more
important, perhaps because of greater availability. Freshwater shellfish remains
are important at some sites along the Brazos River (Hall 1981; L. W. Patterson
field notes on sites 41WL14 and 41WL15, n.d.). The use of freshwater shellfish
is more common after the Middle Archaic, perhaps because increased population
pressure forced use of less preferred food types or because this food type became
more available at certain locations.
Beginning in the terminal Archaic, shell midden sites become important
along the upper Texas coastal margin (Patterson 1979a:Table 2). These sites contain the remains of brackish-water shellfish (Rangia cuneata) and saltwater shellfish (oyster). Large-scale use of shellfish on the coastal margin may be indicative
of influences that moved progressively west from the Louisiana coast. Data on
ceramic types tend to support this hypothesis (Aten and Bollich 1969). It is
somewhat of a mystery to modern investigators as to why such large quantities
of Rangia shellfish were used. A number of my friends in Louisiana have tried
to eat Rangia without success, using a wide variety of preparation and cooking methods. It is understood that Vietnamese immigrants are currently using
Rangia as a food source in the Galveston Bay area.
Story (1981: 148) notes that two different patterns of adaptation appear to
be represented in Southeast Texas: one which relied solely on interior resources,
and another which depended on inland and coastal types of resources. Dillehay
(1975) and Duke (1981) have shown the large variety of faunal remains that can
be round in coastal margin shell middens. Because of the relatively larger
amounts of pottery found at coastal margin sites, a more sedentary lifeway is

262

Texas Archeological Society

indicated than at inland sites. Pottery is not very portable, and large-scale use of
pottery is not suitable for a nomadic lifeway. The account of Cabeza de Vaca
(Covey 1961) indicates, however, that some seasonal movement of coastal margin people did occur. Archeological investigations have so far been able to add
little detail on this subject.
There seems to have been a mid-Holocene intensification of maritime resource exploitation in the New World, with a higher intensity of energy capture
from foods of this type as certain resources (shellfish, for example) became more
abundant. "In this regard, population growth appears to have played a significant
role in further intensification of maritime adaptation (especially exploitation of
more diversified marine resources) in late Holocene times in many areas" (Yesner
1981:445). With respect to Texas coastal margin adaptations, marine foods may
have been a secondary resource. Perlman (1980) comments that people "locate
in terms of critical resources and then adjust those âoptimalâ locations to allow
for access to secondary resources in order to minimize risk." Clark (1981:444)
further notes that "under normal circumstances, most coastally situated huntergatherers are not dependent upon marine (or estuarien) resources to any significant extent. Exploitation of these niches is usually confined to âbufferâ resources
like shellfish, and those resources can be exploited with varying degrees of
intensity."
Future progress in research on subsistence patterns in these regions will depend on the discovery of large samples of faunal remainsand on the availability
of qualified analysts. The number of people available to do detailed analyses of
faunal remains is limited.
TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND REGIONAL DIFFERENCES
As MacNeish (1978) points out, much of archeology is not the investigation
of overall culture, but rather the study of prehistoric technologies, since materials
related to technology are most often preserved. General technological changes
that apply to the regions discussed here have previously been described (Patterson 1976c), and it is now possible to note also some technological differences
between and within these two regions.
Regional differences in projectile point types seem to occur as early as the
early Paleo-Indian period. For example, the Folsom point from site 41WH 19, in
the western transitional zone, is the farthest to the southeast that this point type
has been found to date. For the late Paleo-Indian period, both the upper Texas
coast and the western transitional zone should be regarded as a buffer area between Plains and eastern late Paleo-Indian traditions. Plains styles of late PaleoIndian points found here include Plainview, Scottsbluff, and Angostura. Eastern
styles of late Paleo-Indian points include San Patrice, Dalton, and a variety of
side- and corner-notched points with ground basal edges. For the Early and
Middle Archaic, some differences in projectile point types are seen between the
upper Texas coast and the western transitiona! zone. Carrollton and Trinity points
are common on the upper Texas coast but do not seem to occur west of the Brazos
River. Pedernales, Travis, and Lange points are more common in the western transitional zone than in the upper Texas coast. Marcos points occur mainly in the
western transitional zone. There also are some similarities in projectile point
styles of the Early and Middle Archaic in these two regions. Williams, Bulverde,
and the Gary/Kent series occur commonly in both regions.

Patterson--Southeast Texas

263

Projectile point styles in the two regions seem to have been influenced by
cultural contacts along the major river systems. The Brazos and Colorado rivers
originate from the northwest in Central Texas, and the western transitional zone
reflects influences from Central Texas. The Trinity and Sabine rivers originate in
Northeast Texas, and the upper Texas coast shows influences from this area. Despite these different influences, the upper Texas coast and the western transitional
zone were never culturally isolated areas, as illustrated by a number of shared
projectile point styles.
For the Late Archaic and Early Ceramic periods, there are not a large number of differences in projectile point types between the upper Texas coast and
the western transitional zone. Pedernales and Marcos points remain principally
types of the western transitional zone, perhaps showing continued influences
from Central Texas, but some Pedernales points do continue to be found east of
the Brazos River. Fairland points from this period found in the western transitional zone (Hall 1981) are another indication of influences from Central Texas.
As shown in Table 1, however, the two regions share many projectile point types.
Ponchartrain points found in both regions (Hall 1981; McClurkan 1968; Patterson 1980a) show possible contacts with Louisiana to the east. Hall (1981) has
shown that the Late Archaic was a period of geographically widespread trading
contacts. Fine grades of flint were occasionally imported into these two regions
from the Edwards Plateau throughout the Paleo-Indian and Archaic periods. This
provided opportunities for cultural contacts between Central Texas and the Texas
coast. It has previously been noted (Patterson 1975b) that the upper Texas coast
and Louisiana share a large number of Late Archaic projectile point types. Story
(1981:139) has commented that in environment and broad patterns of cultmal
adaptation, the eastern portion of Texas is part of the southeastern United States.
In relation to this, the upper Texas coast represents the western end of the eastern
Gulf Archaic. It should also be noted that point types such as Catan, Matamoros,
and Refugio that occur more commonly in South Texas also are occasionally
found in the upper Texas coast.
For the Late Prehistoric period, there are indications of both technological
uniformity and diversity between the upper Texas coast and the western transitional zone. Some regional arrow point types, such as Perdiz and Scallorn, have
very wide geographical distributions in East and Central Texas. The Edwards
point type of Central Texas seems to be found more frequently in the western
transitional zone than in the upper Texas coast. The Catahoula arrow point type
that is commonly found in the upper Texas coast has a wide geographical distribution to the north and east (Patterson 1976d).
Technological influences from Northeast Texas are apparent on the northern
fringe of the upper Texas coast during the Late Prehistoric. Caddo pottery types
and Northeast Texas arrow point types, such as Friley, have been found in
Montgomery and Polk counties (McClurkan 1968; Shafer 1968). The Early Ceramic period bone-tempered pottery found in inland Harris County (Patterson
1980c) may also indicate an influence from the north (D. A. Story, personal communication, n.d.).
A considerable diversity in pottery types within these two regions (Aten
1979; Patterson 1980a) may indicate increasing cultural diversity in the Late Prehistoric. Rockport pottery styles are commonly found in the western transitional
zone (Patterson and Hudgins 1981) but are found only occasionally in the upper

Texas coast. Leon Plain pottery seems to occur only in the western transitional
zone, and incised pottery decoration is much more common at coastal margin
sites than at inland sites (Aten 1979; Patterson 1980a). Although the introduction
of pottery to the upper Texas coast seems to have been from Louisiana (Aten and
Bollich 1969), there is a possibility of Mexican influence on the development of
Rockport pottery (Corbin 1974:Figure 14).
The distribution of grog-tempered pottery in the Late Prehistoric is not uniform. For example, in Harris County this pottery type is common at late coastal
margin sites but is not common at inland sites. Grog-tempered pottery has been
found inland in the Brazos River valley (Hall 1981), in Austin County. This
might represent seasonal movements of Indians who more frequently inhabited
the coastal margin. The nonuniform distribution of grog-tempered pottery could
be accounted for by people moving inland on a seasonal basis with selective
use of only certain stream systems. In a similar manner, Rockport type pottery
at only a few inland sites in eastern Wharton County, such as 41WH19 (Patterson and Hudgins 1981), might indicate seasonal movements of people from the
coastal margin, using the San Bernard River system. Aten (1979:205) has noted
significant differences in prehistoric ceramic assemblages of the three major river
systems of the upper Texas coast: the Sabine-Neches, the Trinity-San Jacinto, and
the Brazos.
Even though bone-tempered pottery is found in Early Ceramic period components at inland sites of the upper Texas coast (Patterson 1980a), this pottery
type occurs in significant amounts only in components of the later portion of the
Late Prehistoric in the Galveston Bay area (Aten et al. 1976:Figure 16).
Use of the dart and spear thrower in these regions was not uniform in the
Late Prehistoric. Both dart points and arrow points are found concurrently at inland sites (Aten 1967; Patterson 1980a; Wheat 1953:Table 5). Aten (1979:435)
notes that use of the dart and spear thrower may have been abandoned in favor of
the bow and arrow at coastal margin sites. This might be interpreted as a cultural
preference, as both inland and coastal margin peoples were hunting essentially
the same kinds of fauna, such as deer.
The relatively large amounts of pottery used at coastal margin sites, as compared to inland sites, not only indicates a more sedentary seasonal lifeway but
may also reflect differences in subsistence activities involving food storage and/
or processing. The low amounts of lithic materials found at coastal margin sites
is another indication of technological differences between these two areas.
Aten (1983) has proposed archeological evidence for tribal group territories
on the upper Texas coastal margin in the Late Prehistoric period, based on the
geographic distributions of a few artifact types. However, differences in archeological remains of this time period are much greater between inland and coastal
margin areas than are differences in archeological materials that occur parallel to
the coastline. This implies that tribal groups may have been organized in a manner corresponding to local subsistence patterns, which may then have developed
local cultural patterns. The use of a few technological traits to define prehistoric
tribal group boundaries is a rather tenuous concept, especially in view of the
nomadic nature of the Indians being discussed here.

CONCLUSIONS
The following are major conclusions that can be made with currently available data regarding settlement, subsistence, and technological patterns in the
western transitional zone and the upper Texas coast:
1. A stable settlement pattern, utilizing a broad-based subsistence regime,
was characteristic of inland areas from the late Paleo-Indian through the Late
Prehistoric periods. Many sites have very long occupation sequences.
2. Coastal margin sites oriented toward greater use of marine food resources become more important after the terminal Archaic.
3. Differences in projectile point styles between the upper Texas coast
and the western transitional zone begin as early as the early Paleo-Indian period.
These differences may have been caused by external influences.
4. There are several inter- and intra-regional differences in pottery types,
most of them apparent in the Late Prehistoric period. These differences possibly
indicate cultural differences between and within the regions.
5. Some of the differences in cultural traits between inland and coastal margin sites may reflect local development tied to restricted territorial usages.
6. The upper Texas coast represents the western end of a general Archaic
foraging lifeway common to the entire eastern Gulf coastal plain.
7. Technological differences and similarities within the geographic area discussed here show that cultures did not remain static, even though settlement and
subsistence patterns remained stable over long periods of time.
8. There seems to have been a continued population increase from the
late Paleo-Indian to the Late Prehistoric, judging by the relative number of sites
found to date for each time period (Patterson 1979a:Table 1).
