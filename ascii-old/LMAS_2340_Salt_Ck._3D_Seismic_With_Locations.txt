Lone Mountain performed this survey at the behest of Geokinetics USA, Inc. From August 4 through
August 12, 2017, Lone Mountain field supervisor Thoras Dye and archaeological technicians Michael
McDermott, Jeremy Pittman, Chelsea Winter, and Nick Hostetter performed intensive pedestrian survey of 583.60 acres within Culberson County under Texas State Permit 8100. This fieldwork was
conducted according to guidelines established in Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas, published by the Texas Historical Commission. Corridors were 100 ft wide. The survey area is within Sections 1 through 6, Block 46, on the Cow Mountain, TX; Delaware Spring, TX; Chico Draw East, TX;
and Seven L Peak, TX 7.5' USGS Quadrangles.
Nine isolated manifestations, six previously-recorded sites, and five newly encountered sites were
found within the project area. 41CU729, a thermal feature site that was previously recorded within
the project area, was not found, despite an intensive pedestrian investigation of the plotted UTMs.
The site appears to have been destroyed by buried water line construction.
The isolated manifestations have been completely recorded in a manner consistent with current
standards and do not require any additional work. The proposed seismic project was redesigned so
that all sites would be avoided regardless of eligibility. All vehicle traffic was rerouted to archaeologically surveyed space at least 30 m from the nearest cultural material. The GIS shapefiles for the sites
and their reroutes will be given to project proponent so that these locations can be programmed into
GPS units carried in seismic vehicles. No further treatment is recommended.
Clearance for the undertaking is recommended as no cultural resources will be affected. If buried
cultural deposits or other unexpected discoveries are encountered during the project, work should
cease immediately, and the Texas State Historic Office should be notified.

The surveyed area is in northern Culberson County just south of the Texas-New Mexico state line, with the
Delaware Mountains to the west and northwest and the Rustler Hills to the east. This part of Texas sits on the
Castile geological formation. This is a 500-m thick, soft, and easily eroded layered rock formation laid down
during the Upper Permian epoch of the Paleozoic era. The Castile is striking for its alternating light layers of
rock (gypsum and andydrite) and darker layers of calcite and decomposed organic matter. Thick beds of dolomitic limestone are present at the base in some areas. Deep, narrow arroyos traverse the project area, flowing
east into Virginia Draw, a tributary of the Pecos River. Wild Horse Draw and Chico Draw traverse the area,
flowing into the Delaware River to the north, and a number of playas are present throughout. Weathered
sandstone outcrops run north-south through the central portion of the project, while sinkholes dot the landscape to the east.
Most recorded sites are located in the western portion of the surveyed area, where water is intermittently
available within draws and playas. Small camp sites are present on the perimeters of the flood plains of the
larger draws, increasing in density with proximity to the river. In the center of the project area, sandstone outcrops provided raw materials for grinding implements, attracting prehistoric occupation on sandstone ledges.
Some of the sinkholes toward the eastern edge of the project hold considerable amounts of water, some potable, attracting some occupation as well. In general, site distribution reflects the presence of potable water.
Hamilton (2001) did note, however, that the natives of the nearby Rustler Hills survived on gyp (salty) water,
albeit with some discomfort, in the absence of an alternative source.

Limestone ridges related to the Delaware Mountains are present within the western portion of the survey
area, and contain soils of the Lozier association. Sandstone ridges that run north-south through the center of
the project contain soils from the Leaton association. Mimbres association soils are present within draws, with
Orla association and Holloman association on the plains (Pringle 1980).
The project area falls within the Chihuahuan Desert (Brown 1994). The average daily maximum temperature is
76 degrees Fahrenheit and the average daily minimum temperature is 44 degrees Fahrenheit. The average
annual precipitation is 7.7 inches, ranging from a low of 0.1 inches in April to a high of 1.4 inches in August
(USDA 1980). Elevation is approximately 4,200ft amsl across the project area.

Culberson County falls along a boundary set by some archaeologists between the Eastern and Western TransPecos (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004), while Mallouf (1985) considers the project area part of the âNorthern Sectorâ of the Eastern Trans-Pecos and Lowry (1999) describes the project area as the âPlainsâ subregion of the
Northern Trans-Pecos. The inhabitants of the project area likely had a set of subsistence adaptations that were
quite different from those living in or moving through the basin-and-range topography to the west and south
in other parts of the Trans-Pecos region.
Much of what is known of Culberson County's prehistory has been derived from projectile points, identified
according to their similarity to those found in other regions and dated according to these points' chronological
placements in these sometimes neighboring regions. For this reason, Lone Mountain is following the example
provided by Turpin (2005) in using broad period designations employed elsewhere in Texas (Paleoindian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic) to describe the culture history of our project are and to place archaeological sites within a temporal and cultural framework.

D E S C R I P T I O N

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND SETTING

P R O J E C T

Lone Mountain observed exposed bedrock across the project area, with shallow alluvial deposition along the
numerous drainages and gullies. In addition, wind and water erosion, livestock grazing, rodent burrowing, and
vegetation growth have impacted the topography.

1 :

Culberson County is classified by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department as being within Toboso-Black
Grama grasslands and Cresote Bush-Mesquite shrub vegetation communities, with the latter more closely
associated with the Delaware Mountains. Vegetation is sparse throughout, with the gypsum plain on the east
being almost completely devoid of ground cover. Vegetation includes creosote, mesquite, four-wing saltbush,
tarbrush, acacia, soaptree yucca, prickly pear, cane cholla, Christmas tree cholla, Spanish bayonet, ocotillo,
horse crippler cactus, and various forbs and grasses. Surface visibility is between 80 percent and 90 percent.

Human settlement in North America is first identified during the Paleoindian period (10,500 to 6500 B.C.).
Despite some evidence indicating a human presence in the New World earlier than 10,500 B.C., Anderson and
Faught (2000) argue that current evidence is insufficient to describe any cultural trends prior to the appearance of the Clovis complex at around 10,500 B.C., Hayden's (1976) arguments for the Malpais pre-San Dieguito/San Dieguito material notwithstanding (Heilen 2004). The Paleoindian period is characterized by a
subsistence strategy focused on hunting now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna, including Bison antiquus and
mammoth. Diagnostic stone tools associated with this period include end scrapers and large, unstemmed lanceolate projectile points, which are often fluted. It is postulated that during this period, points were attached
to thrusting spears. A reliance on big game hunting has been established, but it is unclear to what extent
these people exploited other available resources such as plants (Judge 1982). Little evidence has been found to
suggest the use of structures during this period. From negative evidence, it has been assumed that people
lived a nomadic lifestyle with the use of structures apparently uncommon.

C H A P T E R

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 10,500 TO 6500 B.C.)

Three distinct complexes have been identified in west Texas for the Paleoindian period: Clovis, Folsom, and
Plano (a Dalton complex is known in the east). In general archaeological sites are assigned to particular complexes of the Paleoindian period based on the presence of distinctive diagnostic projectile points. The earliest
complex, Clovis, generally dates from as early as 10,500 to 9000 B.C. The tool assemblage is characterized by
Clovis points (which are bifacially worked lanceolate projectile points with a concave base), transverse end
scrapers, side scrapers, bifacial knives, gravers, perforators, and hammerstones (Cordell 1997).
Folsom sites date from 9000 to 8200 B.C. The Folsom complex exhibits technological distinctions from the
Clovis complex. Diagnostic projectile points include fluted Folsom and unfluted Midland points, which are similar in outline. In addition to these points, the tool assemblages include spoke shaves, end scrapers, perforators, knives, denticulates, drills, choppers, awls, and abrading stones (Cordell 1997). These artifacts are often
found in association with bison kill sites.

Plano sites are generally thought of as forming the terminal elements of the Paleoindian big game hunting tradition. Plano is known for a number of artifact complexes. Each complex is distinguished by a series of large
lanceolate and unfluted projectile points, including Angostura, Frederick, Firstview, and Scottsbluff. Turpin
(2005) has reported finding an Angostura point in Culberson County.
ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 6500 B.C. TO A.D. 700)
Although Paleoindian groups probably utilized small game and plant foods in addition to large game species,
a change in subsistence strategy to full reliance on these food sources marks the transition to the Archaic from
the Paleoindian period. Large-scale climatic changes and the extinction of megafauna caused people to
develop a more diverse subsistence base. Mobility was cyclical and more restricted in extent, compared to
Paleoindian strategies. Once productive resource procurement locations were established, these were often
reused on a seasonal basis.
This change in food procurement is marked by wide-ranging changes in the Archaic tool assemblage. While
Paleoindian assemblages consist mainly of projectile points and meat processing tools, a growing number of
groundstone implements suggest a greater reliance on plant foods at this time. Archaic projectile points are
shorter than those of the Paleoindian period, and larger than arrow points used during the following Ceramic
period. Points of this period are generally stemmed or corner-notched, and exhibit more extensive morphological variability and less precision in the quality of manufacture than those of the Paleoindian period.
The Archaic period is typically divided into an Early (6500 to 3500 B.C.), Middle (3500 to 1200 B.C.) and Late
Archaic (1200 B.C. to A.D. 700), with the last few four hundred years between A.D. 300 and 700 referred to
as a Transitional period, when new technologies such as pottery and the bow and arrow seem to have slowly
come into use.
Expected Archaic period projectile points include Pandale, Langtry, Val Verde, Palmillas, Hueco, and Frio. As
Turpin (2005) notes, one of the difficulties in identifying projectile points found in Culberson County, is that
points have often been reworked into other tools prior to discard, often removing stylistic traits that may have
made these points easier to identify.
LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 700 TO 1600)
The Late Prehistoric period is characterized by the adoption of the bow and arrow and the frequent use of
pottery. Pottery found in Culberson includes the same types found in southeastern New Mexico (e.g., brownwares and Chupadero Black-on-white, a decorated type frequently made in central New Mexico). The earliest
use of ceramics in southeastern New Mexico was initially suggested to have occurred between A.D. 600 and
900 (Lehmer 1948, Corley 1965, Jelinek 1967). However, more recently, radiocarbon dates have been
obtained from a limited number of sites indicating that ceramics may have appeared as early as A.D. 200 (LeBlanc 1982). While the appearance of villages next to agricultural fields and reliable water sources appears to
have accompanied these new technologies in neighboring regions, current evidence suggests that life in much
of this part of Trans-Pecos continued to resemble that of the preceding Archaic period, with an increased reliance on bison toward the end of the period.
As Turpin (2005) notes, caves and sinkholes in Culberson County have preserved otherwise perishable Late
Prehistoric remains (Jackson 1937; Hamilton 2001; Ward 1992).
The end of the late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period is sometimes referred to as the Protohistoric period. Projectile points decrease in size, with small triangular points becoming the predominant type.
Many early Protohistoric sites appear to have been contemporary with Ochoa-phase settlements and may represent the appearance of Athabaskans in southeastern New Mexico. The Spanish encountered Jumano (first
called Teya) and Apache (Querecho) groups in the area, and with European contact, metal projectile points
appeared. The Kiowa to the north speak a Tanoan language similar to that spoken in the Tanoan pueblos
(Newcomb 1961). Jelinek (1967) has suggested the Jornada Mogollon from the Fort Sumner area formed the
ancestral core of the Kiowa, who then ranged north and east pursuing bison, while the Jumano are possibly

Native groups present in the area during the Spanish Colonial period were nomadic. Early Spanish records
indicate several native groups on the Llano Estacado including Apaches, Querechos, Vaqueros, and Teyas. Apachean groups extended their range to the southern portion of the state sometime in the 1500s. By about
1630, the Apache were ranging as far south along the Pecos as the Seven Rivers area. During the early 1700s,
Comanches and their allies drove the Apache from the Plains. The Apache settled in the Pecos Valley and in
the mountains of southeastern New Mexico. By the early to mid-1800s Comancheros had established trade
with the Pueblos, Comanche, and other residents of the Plains.
There were no permanent settlements in the area by Pueblo or Hispanic groups during the Spanish Colonial
period (Olmstead 1975). Following the Mexican-American wars. Surveyors and explorers scouting trails (such
as the San Antonio-California Trail) and potential railroad routes began to move through the area beginning as
early as 1848. Mail and overland coach services (with associated stage stops, etc.) were established by 1857. In
the late 1870s railroads began to built through the county, opening the area to ranching. Culberson County
was separated from El Paso County in 1911 and Van Horn became the county seat in 1912.

The Spanish may have entered west Texas prior to A.D. 1536, when Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca, surviving a
shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico, possibly west Texas or portions of northern Mexico just to the south, crossed
into Arizona and making his way south into Mexico (Cabeza de Vaca, Covey 1983), though others argue that
he was already well to the south in northern Mexico (e.g., Weber 1992). Cabeza de Vaca's initial report concerning the lands to the north led to a 1539 expedition by Fray Marcos de Niza. Cabeza de Vaca's and de
Niza's reports in turn prompted Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado to lead the 1540 expedition in search of
riches to be found in the fabled cities of âQuiviraâ (Katz and Katz 1985). West Texas came to be used as a
route by later Spanish explorers to areas north and east. Subsequent expeditions were led by Fray Agustin
RodrÃ­guez and Captain Francisco Sanchez Chamuscado in 1581, Antonio de Espejo in 1582 (who passed
through Culberson County), Don Juan de OÃ±ate y Salazar in 1598, and Gaspar CastaÃ±o de Sosa in 1590 (Kessell 1987).

difficult considering how poorly understood the movements of populations are at the end of the Formative

Lone Mountain performed an intensive pedestrian survey of every source line and every third receiver line on
University Lands in accordance with the scope of work developed for this project. The lines were between 825
ft and 990 ft apart. Corridors were 100 ft wide. One hundred percent survey coverage was accomplished by
the archaeologists walking 15-m interval transects. No artifacts were collected and a photo log was maintained.

M E T H O D S

Lone Mountain conducted a comprehensive cultural resources background review and literature search of the
project area and surrounding 1-mile-wide radius. An archaeologist examined relevant portions of the Cow
Mountain, TX; Delaware Spring, TX; Chico Draw East, TX; and Seven L Peak, TX USGS 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle maps on the THC's Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas). This provided information on the nature
and location of previously conducted surveys and the location of previously recorded cultural resources, including NRHP districts and properties, sites designated as SALs, Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs), Recorded
Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys. Lone Mountain also reviewed
the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay, a mapping/geographic information system
(GIS) database with historic maps and resource information covering most portions of the state. Aerial photographs were also reviewed to assist in identifying any potential cultural resources and disturbances.

he undertaking consists of a 3-D seismic exploration for petrochemical resources within
private and University lands in Culberson County, Texas.

When cultural remains predating 1965 were encountered, a determination was made as to whether they were
an isolated occurrence or a site. Especially intensive low-interval survey was to have been conducted in areas
where previously recorded sites were expected within or near the project area.
All encountered archaeological materials were recorded, in adherence with Council of Texas Archaeologists
(CTA) guidelines (see below) and sites were evaluated for NRHP eligibility and State Archaeological Landmark
status (see below).
All archaeological sites were flagged for avoidance, regardless of NRHP eligibility or any other measure of significance under THC guidelines.
SITE DEFINITION
Sites were defined as a certain number of cultural materials greater than 50 years in age such as five or more
artifacts in a 15 sq m area, or one or more features. Cultural resource sites are extremely variable in size, and
range from a cluster of several objects or materials to structures with associated objects and features. A site
may consist of secondarily deposited cultural resource remains. Features such as hearths, cairns, rock alignments, masonry concentrations, burned adobe, fire-cracked rock concentrations, cists, corrals, and rock art are
generally recorded as sites. Sites also include definite locations of traditional cultural or religious importance to
specified social or cultural groups. Furthermore, sites are at least 50 years old, unless it can be demonstrated
that a property has achieved exceptional importance within the past 50 years (Criterion Consideration G).
SITE RECORDING
Site boundaries were defined according to Texas guidelines. Artifacts and features were marked and site
boundaries were determined by the distribution of these marked cultural materials. Sites were recorded using
a Lone Mountain Site Record form. A sketch map was drawn of each site, and site locations were plotted on
the appropriate USGS quadrangle. GPS readings were taken to verify the accuracy of the field plot and were
taken from a datum located on each sketch map. Photographs were taken showing the setting of each site
and any unique or representative features. A representative sample of artifacts from each site was recorded

using Lone Mountain artifact analysis forms. Drawings of diagnostic or representative formal tools were made.
Examinations of rodent burrows, road cuts, drainages, and other disturbed locations were employed to determine if subsurface cultural deposits were present. Buried charcoal, ash, artifacts, burned rock, or buried cultural strata constitute subsurface cultural materials. Lone Mountain used a GPS to plot the site datum and as
well as features, takes digital photographs of the site setting, any features, and any temporally diagnostic artifacts. Shovel testing was to take place only where surface visibility was below 30 percent. According to the
survey standards, shovel tests were to be at least 30 cm in diameter or on a side and excavated to the bottom
of Holocene deposits, if possible. Excavation levels were to be no thicker than 20 cm, with sediments screened
through Â¼-inch mesh.
ISOLATE DEFINITION
Isolated occurrences/manifestations are cultural remains that do not qualify as sites. They generally consist of
single artifacts or artifact scatters that are of extremely low density and are widely dispersed, and are indicative
of a single or unintentional activity. Isolated occurrences are often found in redeposited context and cannot be
related to other nearby sites or isolated occurrences. In addition, isolated occurrences are generally 50 years
old or older, although Lone Mountain may record more recent materials as isolates if there is a sound reason
for documenting their presence. Isolated occurrences were recorded in the field on the Lone Mountain isolated
occurrence form, a GPS reading was taken, and their locations were plotted on the USGS quadrangle.
EVALUATION AND ELIGIBILITY
Lone Mountain evaluated each archaeological site for NRHP eligibility and State Archaeological Landmark status. The key NRHP-eligibility criterion for most prehistoric sites is the potential of the site to contain additional
data relevant to future research (i.e., NRHP Criterion D). The potential for important additional data is often
dependent on the presence or absence of buried cultural deposits. On each site, the possibility of buried cultural deposits was assessed by a variety of means as noted above. Observations were noted regarding the likelihood of buried cultural deposits based on several characteristics. For example, indications of potential site
depth include stratigraphic soil profiles exposed along road cuts and arroyos or cultural materials in the backdirt piles of rodent burrows. In the case of historic sites, NRHP Criteria A, B, and C are more likely to be relevant. The relationship between the resources within the project area and the historical context of the project
area were taken into account when evaluating these sites.

POST-FIELD METHODS
Upon completion of the fieldwork, GPS locations of reroutes will be given to the proponent to ensure that
grub operators are able to avoid archaeological sites. A report characterizing all discoveries was to be prepared
according to CTA guidelines. As presented under the Texas Antiquities Permit-Terms and Conditions and TAC
Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26.C.26.17, Lone Mountain was to be responsible for preparing all original field
notes, maps, drawings, and photographs for curation at TARL. A curation form will accompany the collections
and be sent to both TARL and THC.

A survey of this area was conducted between 2003 and 2005 by UT, University of Texas (Turpin 2005), finding
sites dating from all prehistoric cultural periods and representing a variety of strategies. One series of sites was
found along one side of a single ridge within the current project area. These six sites (41CU699 through 704)
are all small debitage scatters with a few flaked-stone tools associated with outcroppings at various points
along the ridge. These were temporary sites reflecting procurement of the abundant, good-quality lithic materials in the area. The only temporally-diagnostic artifact found at these sites was an otherwise-unidentified
white chert dart point at 41CU704, suggesting a terminus ante quem for that site of A.D. 700. To the east,
larger sites were found in closer association with water sources. These sites contain fire-cracked rock, staining,
and thermal features, suggesting longer stays, with repeated occupations. 41CU682 is one such site, with evidence for multiple occupations ranging from the Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric.

R E S U L T S

On July 17, 2017, Lone Mountain conducted an online files search of the THC Archaeological Site Atlas to
identify all previously recorded sites and surveys within 1 mile of the surveyed area. Sixteen previously recorded
sites were documented within the search radius, seven of which were located within the survey area (Table
3.1). The locations of these seven sites were revisited during the current survey. Six were relocated and
updated. 41CU729, a single thermal feature, was not found, despite an intensive pedestrian investigation of
the plotted UTMs. The site appears to have been destroyed by buried water line construction.

Nine isolated manifestations, six previously-recorded sites, and five newly encountered sites were found within
the project area. 41CU729, a thermal feature site that was previously recorded within the project, was not
found, despite an intensive pedestrian investigation of the plotted UTMs. The site appears to have been
destroyed by buried water line construction.
ISOLATED MANIFESTATIONS
Nine isolated manifestations were found in the project area (Table 3.2). The locations of these resources were
recorded using a Garmin Oregon 650t global positioning system and plotted and listed in Appendix A.

UT recorded a very large assemblage, including several dart and arrow point fragments, bifaces, unifaces,
cores, flakes, and hammerstones. It was noted that artifacts were extremely dense around the tank and grinding stones increased in frequency at the northern end of the site.
During the current investigation, between 500 and 1,000 artifacts were visible on the surface. The assemblage
includes hundreds of pieces of debitage in all stages of reduction; 12 tools (choppers, utilized flakes, unifaces,
and bifaces); nine cores; and seven groundstone fragments. Lithic raw materials are sandstone, quartzite and
chert. (Turner et al. 2011). At least 10,000 fire-cracked rock fragments are scattered across the site.
UT found a large number of hearths, with the most intact samples at that time occurring on the southeast side
of Wild Horse Tank (Turpin 2005). Lone Mountain found 10 fire-cracked rock features ranging from 1 m to 4 m
in size, all with ash staining (Features 1 through 8 and Feature 10) or charcoal (Feature 9). All contain approximately 1,000 fire-cracked rocks ranging from 2 cm to 35 cm in size, averaging 10 cm. All of the features are
eroding from slopes and drainages and are heavily deflated, remaining between 15 percent and 25 percent
intact.

41CU682 was first recorded by Borderlands Archeological Research Unit at the University of Texas (UT) in 2003
as a dense artifact and fire-cracked rock scatter with fire-cracked rock concentrations âtoo numerous to
countâ (Turpin 2005). The site runs along a ridge parallel to Wild Horse Draw, surrounds Wild Horse Tank, and
continues downslope to an unnamed arroyo. Lone Mountain found the site much as previously described.
Vegetation includes mesquite, creosote, four-wing saltbush, soaptree yucca, little leaf horse brush, cholla, and
various grasses and forbs. Surface visibility is approximately 90 percent.

C H A P T E R

41CU682

Gully cutbanks reveal that eolian and alluvial sediments are present to 2 m thick. The presence of surface staining, artifacts eroding from slopes, and partially buried fire-cracked rock, suggest that subsurface cultural materials are present to at least 10 cmbs. The site has been subject to slopewashing, wind erosion, bioturbation,
and construction of a fenceline, and remains approximately 20 percent intact.
Previous artifacts indicate that 41CU682 has a Late Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric temporal and cultural affiliation. The large number of artifacts and broad date range suggest that this location was reused many times
over the years; individual components could not be differentiated. Ash and charcoal are present within the features and subsurface cultural remains are present to at least 10 cmbs. The site is therefore recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D.
41CU699
41CU699 is one of a series of lithic procurement and reduction sites (LA 41CU699 through 41CU704) found
by UT in 2005 (Turpin 2005). These small flaked-stone artifact sites run along a ridge west of the confluence of
Chico and Wild Horse Draws. The only temporally-diagnostic artifact found was an otherwise-unidentified
white chert dart point at 41CU704.
41CU99 is located on a gravel and cobble-strewn hilltop, with shallow to no sediment deposition. Vegetation
within the site and across the surrounding area is very sparse, and includes whitethorn acacia, creosote, soaptree yucca, soap berry, little-leaf horse brush, desert holly, prickly pear, rainbow cactus, and various forbs and
grasses. Ground visibility is more than 90 percent.
The site was described by UT as a 50-m diameter surface lithic scatter with no diagnostic elements (Turpin
2005). The site remains as described, though artifacts have become scattered and boundaries were increased
to 50 m by 85 m to encompass these materials. The assemblage currently includes 51 pieces of flaked-stone
debitage, three flaked-stone tools, and nine cores, all of quartzite and chert. No diagnostic artifacts, firecracked rock, or cultural staining was evident.

No subsurface cultural materials are suspected to be present here. The artifacts are scattered across a largely
bare surface and are becoming displaced through wind and water action and bioturbation in many forms,
including cattle grazing, feral hog pit-rooting, and rodent burrowing. The site remains approximately 25 percent intact.
As no temporally diagnostic artifacts have been seen at 41CU699, the site has an Unknown Aboriginal
(10,500 B.C. to A.D. 1880) temporal and cultural affiliation. No subsurface materials are present, and the site
is therefore recommended ineligible for nomination to the NRHP under any of the four criteria.

41CU701
41CU701 is one of a series of lithic procurement and reduction sites (LA 41CU699 through 41CU704) found
by UT in 2005 (Turpin 2005). These small flaked-stone artifact sites run along a ridge west of the confluence of
Chico and Wild Horse Draws. The only temporally-diagnostic artifact found at these sites was an otherwiseunidentified white chert dart point at 41CU704.
41CU701 is located on an exposed, rocky limestone surface on a saddle between two knolls on the ridge. Vegetation is very sparse, and includes whitethorn acacia, creosote, and various forbs and grasses. Ground visibility is more than 90 percent.
The site was described by UT as a 25-m diameter surface lithic scatter with no diagnostic elements (Turpin
2005). The site remains as described, though artifacts have become scattered and boundaries were increased
to 35 m by 50 m to encompass these materials. The assemblage currently includes 18 pieces of flaked-stone
debitage and four cores, all of quartzite and chert. No diagnostic artifacts, fire-cracked rock, or cultural staining was evident.

No subsurface cultural materials are possible in this sedimentary environment. The artifacts are scattered across
a bare surface and are becoming displaced through wind and water action. The site remains approximately 18
percent intact.
As no temporally diagnostic artifacts have been seen at 41CU701, the site has an Unknown Aboriginal
(10,500 B.C. to A.D. 1880) temporal and cultural affiliation. No subsurface materials are present, and the site
is therefore recommended ineligible for nomination to the NRHP under any of the four criteria.
41CU704
41CU704 is one of a series of lithic procurement and reduction sites (LA 41CU699 through 41CU704) found
by UT in 2005 (Turpin 2005). These small flaked-stone artifact sites run along the east side of an isolated ridge
west of the confluence of Chico and Wild Horse Draws.
41CU704 is located on an exposed ridge. Vegetation within the site and across the surrounding area is very
sparse, and includes whitethorn acacia, creosote, little-leaf horse brush, prickly pear, rainbow cactus, juniper,
and various forbs and grasses. Ground visibility is more than 85 percent.
The site was described by UT as a 20-m by 300-m lithic scatter that includes the only potentially temporally
diagnostic artifact found at any of the four sites, an untyped white chert dart point (Turpin 2005). The site
remains as described, though the boundaries were decreased to 20 m by 65 m to encompass currently visible
cultural materials. The assemblage currently includes 23 pieces of flaked-stone debitage, two choppers, and
eight cores, all of quartzite, silicified sandstone, and chert. The previously recorded dart point was not relocated. No Fire-cracked rock or cultural staining was evident.
No subsurface cultural materials are present here, as most of the site is on exposed bedrock, with some areas
of very shallow deposition. The artifacts are scattered across the bare surface and are becoming displaced
through wind and water action and limited bioturbation resulting from cattle grazing and rodent burrowing.
The site remains approximately 20 percent intact.
UT (Turpin 2005) reported an unidentified dart point, suggesting an Unknown Aboriginal (10,500 B.C. to A.D.
700) temporal and cultural affiliation. No subsurface materials are present, and the site is therefore recommended ineligible for nomination to the NRHP under any of the four criteria.
41CU705
LA 41CU705 was first encountered by UT at the base of the southeastern tip of the ridge occupied by sites
41CU700 through 41CU704. Sparse vegetation, including whitethorn acacia, mesquite, soap tree yucca, and
various forbs and grasses, is present across the site, leaving approximately 90 percent of the surface visible.
UT described the site as a 100-m diameter burned rock scatter with three intact hearths (Turpin 2005). Currently, the site consists of a sparse lithic artifact scatter with no features. Site boundaries were decreased to 50
m in diameter. The previously recorded assemblage contained a medial arrow point fragment designated as
âLate Prehistoricâ on the site form, flaked-stone debitage, and a chopper (Turpin 2005). The assemblage currently includes 60 pieces of flaked-stone debitage and six cores, all of quartzite, chalcedony, and chert. The
previously reported projectile point was not relocated, and no burned rock was seen during this visit.
Water erosion in the form of sheetwashing and gullying has had the most serious impact on this site. These
processes have resulted in the dislocation of cultural materials and the formation of isolated hummocks across
the site. Bioturbation and wind action have also disturbed the site.
No subsurface cultural materials are present here, as most of the site is on exposed bedrock, with some areas
of very shallow deposition. The artifacts are scattered across the bare surface and are becoming displaced
through wind and water action and limited bioturbation resulting from cattle grazing and rodent burrowing.
The site remains approximately 20 percent intact.

UT reported a Late Prehistoric medial arrow point fragment, suggesting Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric/Historic dates of A.D. 700 to 1880. No subsurface materials are present, and the site is therefore recommended
ineligible for nomination to the NRHP under any of the four criteria.
41CU730
SEVEN L SINKHOLE

41CU730 was first discovered by UT in 2005 (Turpin 2005) around a large sinkhole north of Seven L Well. The
sinkhole has become infilled as a result of sediment deposition, but may once have held water. Vegetation
includes mesquite, juniper, soaptree yucca, allthorn, little leaf horse brush, acacia, cholla, creosote, and various
grasses and forbs. Surface visibility is approximately 95 percent.
The site was described as a 500-m diameter, dense lithic artifact and fire-cracked rock scatter with at least two
and possibly more fire-cracked rock features (Turpin 2005). The site currently contains 92 lithic artifacts, thousands of fire-cracked rocks, and six features. The previously recorded assemblage included debitage, scrapers,
bifaces, unifaces, and a projectile point fragment identified as a possible Middle-Archaic Pandale type (ca.
4000 to 2500 B.C.). Turpin notes that this point type is normally found within the Lower Pecos region, placing
this specimen well outside its expected geographic range (Turpin 2005). Currently, the assemblage includes 76
pieces of flaked-stone debitage, 12 flaked-stone tools, a core, and three groundstone fragments, all of limestone, quartzite, and chert. The previously-reported projectile point was not found.
Lone Mountain found six fire-cracked rock features measuring between 1-m in diameter and 19 m by 10 m.
Features 3 and 4 have ash staining to more than 10 cmbs.
The site is primarily on exposed ground, with some areas of very shallow eolian deposition. Much of the site
has been subject to sheetwash, and the material closer to Seven L Well has been impacted by bulldozer clearing. A fenceline and bladed road are present to the east, and Turpin (2005) suspected some looting of the site,
based on its proximity to Seven L Well. Livestock grazing, rodent burrowing, and wind erosion have also
affected the area, leaving the site approximately 20 percent intact.

41CU730 has an Early to Middle Archaic (4000 to 2500 B.C.) temporal and cultural affiliation, based on the
previously-reported projectile point. Ash staining is present within Feature 3 and 4 to more than 10 cmbs. The
site is therefore recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D.
41CU841
41CU841 is a large, dense artifact and fire-cracked rock scatter with 10 features located between a low rise in
the west and a low, rocky finger ridge in the east. Chico Draw is located approximately Â¼ mile to the east/
southeast. Vegetation includes mesquite, creosote, four-wing saltbush, soaptree yucca, little leaf horse brush,
rainbow cactus, prickly pear, cholla, and various grasses and forbs. Surface visibility is 85 percent.
The site assemblage includes more than 500 pieces of flaked-stone debitage, nine flaked-stone tools, 12 cores,
and three groundstone fragments. Approximately 30 percent of all observed debitage and 100 percent of all
other observed artifact types was recorded. The recorded assemblage includes 142 pieces of flaked-stone debitage (two primary reduction flakes, 46 secondary reduction flakes, 74 tertiary reduction flakes, four thinning
flakes, 16 pieces of angular debris); nine tools (one uniface, two scrapers, six projectile points); 13 cores (eight
multidirectional, five bidirectional); a basin metate, and two indeterminate metate fragments. Lithic raw materials are sandstone, quartzite and chert. The projectile points include Frio, two Hueco, Langtry, Palmillas, and
one unidentifiable dart fragment (Figure 3.16). These points reflect Middle Archaic through Late Archaic/Transitional dates (Turner et al. 2011). Thousands of fire-cracked rock fragments are scattered across the site.
Lone Mountain found 10 fire-cracked rock features, three with ash staining (Features 4, 5, and 8). Trowel testing was conducted in all features, revealing subsurface cultural deposits in all except Feature 7.

41CU841 has a Middle Archaic through Late Archaic/Transitional (3000 B.C. to A.D. 700) temporal and cultural affiliation, based on the projectile points. Ash is present in three of the features (Features 4, 5, and 8) and
subsurface remains are present to 10 cmbs in Features 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 and to 5 cmbs in Feature 10.
The site is therefore recommended eligible for nomination to the NRHP under Criterion D.
41CU842
41CU842 is a moderate artifact and fire-cracked rock scatter located on exposed shale and caliche gravels on
a hill top just west of Seven L Well. Vegetation includes juniper, ocotillo, mesquite, horse brush, prickly pear,
and various grasses and forbs. Surface visibility is approximately 90 percent.
The artifact assemblage includes 110 pieces of flaked-stone debitage (16 secondary reduction flakes, 85 tertiary reduction flakes, one thinning flake, two pressure flakes, six pieces of angular debris); 13 flaked-stone
tools (two unifaces, five utilized flakes, two scrapers, two bifaces, and two non-diagnostic projectile point
fragments); one bidirectional core; and four Chupadero Black-on-white sherds. Lithic raw materials are dolomite, quartzite, chalcedony, chert, and silicified sandstone. Approximately 20 fire-cracked rock fragments are
scattered across the site.
Most of the site is on exposed shale with caliche gravels. There is some shallow deposition to approximately 20
cm in some areas, as seen within rodent burrows. A single trowel test was conducted within one of these
areas, revealing a fire-cracked rock fragment at 6 cmbs. Additional subsurface cultural materials are possible,

but unlikely on this largely exposed surface. As the site is on a hill top, the primary impact has been water and
wind. Some cattle trampling and rodent burrowing have also disturbed and disarticulated cultural materials.
The site remains approximately 35 percent intact.
41CU842 has a Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1100 to 1500) temporal and cultural affiliation, based on the ceramics. A
trowel test revealed one buried fire-cracked rock at 6 cmbs. This site consists of a moderately sized and diverse
artifact assemblage that appears to be confined to a relatively small area, which may indicate a discrete activity
area. Furthermore, the presence of buried deposits infers that the site retains some level of geomorphological
integrity. Therefore, test excavations would be needed to complete the evaluation process. This site is recommended to have an undetermined eligibility for nomination to the NRHP.
41CU843
41CU843 is a sparse lithic artifact and fire-cracked rock scatter with one feature located on a low rise 70 m
southeast of Chico Draw. Vegetation includes mesquite, creosote, four-wing saltbush, soaptree yucca, and various grasses and forbs. Surface visibility is approximately 90 percent.
The artifact assemblage includes a secondary reduction flake, a tertiary flake, and a chopper, all of chert.
Approximately 20 fire-cracked rock fragments are scattered across the site.
Lone Mountain found one feature. Feature 1 is a 0.2-m by 1.5-m concentration of fire-cracked rock. The rock
fragments measure between 2 cm and 16 cm, averaging 8 cm. Eight trowel tests were conducted within and
around the feature, revealing no subsurface cultural materials. The feature is located atop a low rise, and
remains approximately 30 percent intact.
Water action, wind erosion, and bioturbation have impacted the site, leaving it approximately 20 percent
intact. Eolian and alluvial sediments are present to 2 m deep in some places, as revealed within a gully cutbank
just west of the site.

41CU843 has an Unknown Aboriginal (10,500 B.C. to A.D. 1880) temporal and cultural affiliation, based on
the assemblage and feature type. Testing revealed no subsurface cultural materials. The site is therefore recommended ineligible for nomination to the NRHP under any of the four criteria.
41CU844
41CU844 is a moderate artifact and fire-cracked rock scatter with three features located on a ridgeline just
north of Chico Draw. Vegetation includes mesquite, creosote, little leaf horse brush, prickly pear, and various
grasses and forbs. Surface visibility is approximately 90 percent.
The site assemblage includes 37 pieces of flaked-stone debitage (three primary reduction flakes, nine secondary flakes, 22 tertiary flakes, one thinning flake, and two pieces of angular debris); four flaked-stone tools (two
bifaces, one uniface, and one utilized flake); and seven cores (three unidirectional, one bidirectional, one multidirectional, two tested cobbles). Approximately 100 fire-cracked rock fragments are scattered across the site.
Lone Mountain found three features. Feature 1 is a 6-m by 5-m concentration of approximately 1,000 firecracked rocks ranging from 3 cm to 35 cm in size, averaging 20 cm. Trowel tests revealed buried fire-cracked
rock to 3 cmbs. The feature is located on a slope and remains approximately 30 percent intact.
Feature 2 is a concentration of approximately 100 fire-cracked rocks with ash staining, several flakes, and a
core. The rocks are between 3 cm and 12 cm in size, averaging 9 cm. Trowel tests revealed staining to at least
10 cmbs. The feature is also located on a slope and remains approximately 25 percent intact.
Feature 3 is a 3-m by 2-m concentration of approximately 90 fire-cracked rocks ranging from 2 cm to 13 cm in
size, averaging 10 cm. Trowel tests revealed buried fire-cracked rock to 5 cmbs. Two cores were found within
this feature. The feature is located on a slope near a drainage, and has been subjected to cattle grazing,
remaining approximately 20 percent intact.
Water action, wind erosion, and bioturbation have impacted the site, leaving it approximately 30 percent
intact. Based on drainage cutbanks, colluvial sediments are present to approximately 0.30 m thick.
41CU844 has an Unknown Aboriginal (10,500 B.C. to A.D. 1880) temporal and cultural affiliation, based on
the artifacts and feature types. Ash is present in Feature 2, and subsurface remains are present within all the
features from 3 cmbs to more than 10 cmbs. The site is therefore recommended eligible for nomination to the
NRHP under Criterion D.
41CU845
41CU845 is a moderate artifact and fire-cracked rock scatter with one feature between University Road on the
west and Chico Draw to the east. Vegetation includes mesquite, creosote, cholla, and various grasses and
forbs. Surface visibility is approximately 80 percent.
The artifact assemblage includes 82 pieces of flaked-stone debitage (one primary reduction flake, 33 secondary flakes, 44 tertiary flakes, one thinning flake, and three pieces of angular debris); eight cores (one bidirectional, six multidirectional, one tested cobble); two indeterminate metate fragments; and one one-hand mano.
Raw materials include sandstone, quartzite, and chert. Approximately 100 fire-cracked rock fragments are
scattered across the site.
Lone Mountain found one feature. Feature 1 is a 6-m by 5-m concentration of approximately 400 fire-cracked
rocks ranging from 2 cm to 19 cm in size, averaging 5 cm. Thirty two pieces of flaked-stone debitage, two
cores, and a groundstone fragment are present within the feature. Eight trowel tests were performed within
and surrounding this feature, revealing no subsurface cultural materials of any kind. The feature is located on
sandy ground along an ephemeral drainage and remains approximately 25 percent intact.

Nine isolated manifestations, six previously-recorded sites, and five newly encountered sites were found within
the project area (Table 3.4). 41CU729, a thermal feature site that was previously recorded within the project
area, was not found, despite an intensive pedestrian investigation of the plotted UTMs. The site appears to
have been destroyed by buried water line construction.
In keeping with patterns recognized by Turpin (2005), the sites recorded during the current survey reflect
exploitation of lithic and food resources within this area through all cultural periods. The sites reflect varying
strategies relating to the various topographies in the area. A series of lithic procurement sites (41CU699
through 704) dots the ridge in the western portion of the project. These sites, discovered by Turpin (2005), are
small debitage scatters with a few flaked-stone tools. They were revisited and found to have remained much
as described. No hearths or grinding stones were left in these locations, indicating that occupation was shortterm, probably no more than a few hours. These were temporary sites reflecting procurement of the abundant, good quality lithic materials in the area. To the east, larger sites were found in closer association with
water sources. These sites contain fire-cracked rock, staining, and thermal features, suggesting longer stays,
with repeated occupations. 41CU682 is one such site, with evidence for multiple occupations ranging from
the Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric.

41CU845 has an Unknown Aboriginal (10,500 B.C. to A.D. 1880) temporal and cultural affiliation, based on
the artifacts and feature types. No staining is present, and testing of the feature revealed no subsurface cultural deposits. However, 41CU845 is within an eolian setting that may obfuscate buried cultural deposits elsewhere on the site. At present, data potential is unclear and it is recommended that NRHP eligibility remain
undetermined until further testing can be performed.

C H A P T E R

Alluvial and eolian sediments are present to approximately 3 m. The primary impact to the site is slopewashing
into the Chico Draw. Numerous ephemeral drainages are present across the site, carrying fire-cracked rock
downslope. Wind erosion and bioturbation have also impacted the site, which remains approximately 40 percent intact.

The isolated manifestations have been completely recorded in a manner consistent with current standards and
do not require any additional work. The proposed seismic project was redesigned so that all sites would be
avoided regardless of eligibility. All vehicle traffic was rerouted to archaeologically surveyed space at least 30 m
from the nearest cultural material. The GIS shapefiles for the sites and their reroutes are given to the project
proponent so that these locations can be programmed into GPS units carried in seismic vehicles. No further
treatment is recommended.
Clearance for the undertaking is recommended as no cultural resources will be affected. If buried cultural
deposits or other unexpected discoveries are encountered during the project, work should cease immediately,
and the Texas State Historic Office should be notified.
