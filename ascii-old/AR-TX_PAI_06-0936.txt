ABSTRACT
On April 11, 2019, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive
archeological survey of a proposed 3-acre park in western San Antonio, Texas. The survey was
done under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8834. The park is on the north side of Joe Newton
Street at its intersection with Mabe Road, northwest of where Culebra Road meets Interstate
Highway 410. The Concept Plan for park development includes a short access road and small
parking lot, a concrete trail that loops through the park with lighting, a restroom, a small
playground, a drinking fountain, a picnic table, benches at several locations, and interpretive
signage. The horizontal area of potential effects for the project is 3 acres. The vertical area of
potential effects will be less than 1 ft in most places. The survey identified one historic site,
41BX2284, corresponding to structures indicated on 1963 and possibly 1953 aerial photographs.
Archival research indicates that the site likely consists of outbuildings associated with owners
who lived on other tracts nearby. Because of its recent age and nonresidential function,
41BX2284 lacks the capacity to contribute important information. Thus, it is considered
ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places and designation as a State
Antiquities Landmark. No additional archeological investigations are warranted at 41BX2284
prior to construction of the proposed park facilities. The survey did not recover any artifacts
requiring curation. Project records and photographs currently housed at the offices of Prewitt
and Associates, Inc., will be transferred to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at
The University of Texas at Austin.

INTRODUCTION
On April 11, 2019, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted
an intensive archeological survey of proposed Pipers Meadow Park in western
San Antonio, Texas (Figure 1). The survey was done under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 8834. The 3-acre park is on the north side of Joe Newton Street at its
intersection with Mabe Road, northwest of where Culebra Road meets Interstate
Highway 410. The Concept Plan for park development includes a short access
road and small parking lot (five spaces), a concrete trail that loops through the
park with lighting, a restroom, a small playground, a drinking fountain, a picnic
table, benches at several locations, and interpretive signage. The horizontal area
of potential effects for the project is 3 acres. The vertical area of potential effects
will be less than 1 ft in most places. All work done during this survey complied
with the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource
Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191, VTCS 6145-9) and the City of San Antonioâs
Historic Preservation and Design Section of the Unified Development Code (Article
6 35-360-634).
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is near the edge of the Balcones Escarpment along the
boundary between the Blackland Prairie to the southeast and the Edwards Plateau
to the northwest (Arbingast et al. 1973:6; Griffith et al. 2004; McMahan et al.
1984:Figure 1). This portion of the Blackland Prairie is characterized by rolling
to nearly level tall-grass plains underlain by soft interbedded marls, chalks,
limestones, and shales. The scarp along the edge of the Edwards Plateau is a
rugged dissected landscape of limestone hills and canyons created by extensive
stream downcutting and headward erosion. According to the Geologic Atlas of
Texas, the project area subsurface geology is the Upper Cretaceous Pecan Gap
Chalk (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983). The project area, which contains no
natural surface water sources, is 0.5 km west of Leon Creek. Quaternary terrace
deposits are mapped along the creek and extending west toward the project area
but not into it. No Holocene alluvium is mapped along this stretch of Leon Creek or
anywhere near the project area. According to the U. S. Department of Agricultureâs
Web Soil Survey, soils are Eckrant cobbly clay, 1â8 percent slopes. This is a rocky
clay soil developed in residuum weathered from limestone bedrock. The potential
for Native American archeological sites in this setting is low because it is distant
from water sources, although the presence of a karst feature within the park (shown
as âExisting Caveâ on the Concept Plan) increases the chances for archeological
remains (e.g., Wilder et al. 2003:136).
The proposed park area is characterized by scattered clusters of live oak
trees surrounded by open grassy areas that loosely correlate with open areas and
two-track paths visible on 1953, 1963, and 1973 aerial photographs (Figure 2a).
The underlying limestone bedrock is uneven and undulating across the project
area, and much of it is fractured and uplifted in pieces around the bases of trees.
The thin topsoil covering the bedrock has been removed in some locations by
confined or surface flow. Exposures of limestone bedrock and subangular cobbles

and pebbles of weathered bedrock are visible even beneath the more tree-covered
areas (Figure 2b). Historic aerial photographs indicate that the project area has
been characterized by a similar vegetation pattern of live oak tree clusters and
open terrain since at least 1953 with no significant changes, although surrounding
parcels were extensively cleared prior to urban sprawl. The karst feature is in the
west-central part of the proposed park area and is a heavily overgrown sinkhole or
surface collapse surrounded by old-growth live oak trees. The area surrounding the
karst feature consists of highly fractured surface bedrock, patchy sediment cover,
and weathered subangular limestone pieces.
RESULTS OF FILE SEARCH
Review of the Texas Historical Commissionâs Archeological Sites Atlas
revealed that there is one recorded archeological site and six previous archeological
investigations within 1 km of the project area. Site 41BX1880 is 0.7 km to the
east-northeast, on the west bank of Huebner Creek upstream from its confluence
with Leon Creek. It is a prehistoric burned rock midden recorded in 2010 during a
survey for the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) (Clark and Murray 2011). Burned
rocks, lithic debitage, a scraper, and a biface were observed on the surface of the
heavily looted midden, which was judged to be ineligible for listing in the National
Register of Historic Places and designation as a State Antiquities Landmark. One
of the six previous investigations was the 2010 survey for the flood control project
along Huebner Creek in which 41BX1880 was recorded. Most of the others were
associated with work along Leon Creek. One was a survey in 2005 for a SAWS
water line that paralleled the west side of the creek north, east, and south of the
project area; it identified no sites near the project area (Carpenter 2005). Another
was a survey in 2008 for the City of San Antonio of a proposed multi-use trail
along Leon and Culebra Creeks east and north of the project area; it identified
no sites near the project area (Campbell and Jones 2009). A third was a survey in
2011 for the City of San Antonio of a segment of trail along Leon Creek south of
the segment surveyed in 2008; it identified no sites (Champion 2011). The fourth
was a 2009 survey for Bexar County along Ingram Road where it crosses Huebner
and Leon Creeks southeast of the project area; it identified no sites (Miller et al.
2011). Finally, the Atlas depicts a linear survey along Culebra Road southwest
of the project area, but it lists no information other than that the work was done
in 1985.
An aerial photograph taken in 1953 provides inconclusive evidence about
whether improvements were present because it is of low resolution, but based on
visible clearings and roads or tracks also visible on later aerials, it is likely that
a cluster of structures was present along the west edge of the project area. These
structures are readily evident on 1963 and 1973 aerial photographs, immediately east
of a driveway that runs north from Joe Newton Road to a house or farmstead west
of the current project area. The 1953 USGS quadrangle confirms the presence of a
single building on the tract side by that time. Earlier maps (1903 USGS quadrangle
and 1918 and 1927 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maps) do not show improvements
on the property.

METHODS OF FIELD INVESTIGATION
The archeological survey consisted of 100 percent pedestrian coverage of
the 3-acre project area by a single archeologist, who walked multiple transects
spaced less than 30 m apart across the area and examined surface exposures for
evidence of prehistoric and historic artifacts and features. Shovel testing was
unnecessary in some portions of the area because ground surface visibility was
good (more than 50 percent) and weathered limestone and bedrock were visible
at the surface. The entire project area is characterized by a thin (10â20 cm or
less) sediment cover and weathered limestone capping shallow intact limestone
bedrock. Weathered limestone and bedrock exposures are common, as are small
surface drainage channels that have dissected the existing soil cover exposing
the limestone bedrock. Nine shovel tests were dug in areas where ground surface
visibility was poor (30 percent or less), exceeding the Texas Historical Commissionâs
survey standards for parcels of this size (two tests per acre). All shovel tests were
30 cm in diameter and excavated in 10-cm levels. All removed sediments were
screened through 1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth.
SURVEY RESULTS
All nine shovel tests, including the three within newly discovered historic
site 41BX2284, encountered 10â20 cm of dark brown clay loam or silty clay loam
with weathered limestone clasts above limestone bedrock. Subangular weathered
limestone, ranging from fist- to walnut-sized pieces, was noted at 0â20 cm below
the surface and stopping at the contact with bedrock. No prehistoric or historic
artifacts and no chert were observed in any of these tests. Given the absence of
chert and the project areaâs location away from suitable sources of water, the area
does not appear to have been suitable for any prehistoric long-term or repeated
occupation.
The survey found no prehistoric sites or isolated artifacts, but it did find
cultural features and surface debris dating to the mid and late twentieth century
in the northwest portion of the project area that were designated as 41BX2284
(Figure 3). This site correlates with improvements visible on 1963 and 1973 aerial
photographs, and probably on a 1953 aerial image as well. The site is associated
with a prepared, leveled area measuring ca. 30 m north-south and 20â25 m eastwest. Two small (3x7 and 2x5 m) poured concrete slabs a few meters apart are in
the west-central part of the leveled area (Figure 4). An above-ground electrical box/
tie-in with modern PVC pipe is 5â6 m north of the slabs, next to a placed limestone
border surrounding a live oak tree (see Figure 4). A stack of reclaimed bricks is
at the southwest corner of the leveled area along the western parcel fence, and a
concrete-capped well is a few meters south of there, 12â15 m from the concrete
slabs (Figure 5a). The well had been fitted with an electrical pump inside based
on the cut modern heavy-gauge electrical wire exiting the top. A brick scatter
(consisting of DâHanis half bricks) and a single-course concrete block foundation
or border (Figure 5b) are downslope east of the leveled area, 19 and 30 m from
the concrete slabs. The latter measures 3x3 m and lacks blocks on the west side.
Artifacts observed around the features are sparse, consisting of glass sherds, a

garden hose, pieces of carpet, and milled lumber. Based on this and the small
size of the foundations, it is likely the site represents a collection of outbuildings
rather than a domestic occupation, a conclusion that is supported by the results
of archival research (see below).
An additional small feature was found outside 41BX2284, near the east
edge of the survey area. It consists of a ca. 1-m-diameter cast-concrete circle or
section of round culvert set vertically in the ground and extending ca. 20 cm above
it. Its function and associations with 41BX2284 (if any) are unknown. No additional
cultural materials are in the vicinity of this isolated feature.
Archival research indicates that the improvements at 41BX2284, which is
on the 4,605.5-acre Elizabeth Keenan Plunkett Survey, may have been associated
initially with William âWillieâ Raymond Sr. and Anita Elizabeth Steubing Morgan,
who acquired the 3.03-acre tract in 1948 from Anitaâs parents, Walter C. and Edna
Mary Wehmeyer Steubing (Bexar County, Deed Record 2619:255). The parcel was
part of a 601-acre farm that Edna Steubingâs father, Herman C. Wehmeyer Sr.
(1857â1924), had established by 1905 and that stayed in the Wehmeyer family till
1948 (Bexar County, Deed Record 211:495, Deed Record 245:192; Find A Grave
2019). The Morgans did not live on the 3.03-acre parcel, however, judging from the
facts that they spent more than $3,900 in 1955 improving a 1-acre parcel out of the
Plunkett Survey slightly to the northeast (Bexar County, Mechanics Lien 421:375)
and that, upon her 1978 death, Anita Elizabeth Steubing Morgan resided at 7347
Joe Newton Road east of the project area (Ancestry 1978). Thus, if they built the
original improvements at 41BX2284, then those improvements must have been
outbuildings.
Also possibly associated with the initial improvements were Roy W. and
Virginia H. Karsch, who acquired the property from the Morgans in 1953 (Bexar
County, Deed Record 3409:167) and owned it till 1966, when they sold it to Kirby and
Karen Gull (Bexar County, Deed Record 5643:821). This was likely not the Karschâs
residence, though, as they committed more than $2,500 between 1949 and 1953 to
improving a nearby 0.433-acre parcel out of the Plunkett Survey (Bexar County,
Mechanics Liens 305:508, 379:73). Likewise, the Gulls probably never resided here.
Kirby Gull had received a divinity degree from the Perkins School of Theology at
Southern Methodist University in Dallas, and then resided in San Antonio while
studying for a masterâs degree in social work at Our Lady of the Lake College and
working as a minister for the Oxford United Methodist Church until 1967, after
which they moved to Houston and then Iowa.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Survey of the proposed Pipers Meadow Park identified one historic
archeological site (41BX2284) that correlates with improvements present at least
by 1963 and probably a decade or more earlier. Features present consist of two
small concrete foundations, an electrical box, a well, a concrete block foundation
or border, a limestone landscaping feature, a stack of bricks, and a brick scatter.
Archival research indicates that the site likely consists of outbuildings associated

with owners who lived on other tracts nearby. Because of its recent age and
nonresidential function, 41BX2284 lacks the capacity to contribute important
information. Thus, it is considered ineligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places and designation as a State Antiquities Landmark. No additional
archeological investigations are warranted at 41BX2284 prior to construction of
the proposed park facilities.
