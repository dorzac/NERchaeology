This report documents a cultural resource inventory conducted on eight parcels totaling 1,319 acres at Lake B. A.
Steinhagen and Lake Sam Rayburn in East Texas. Work was conducted for the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, Fort Worth District, which has proposed timber harvesting. In compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act, the inventories were done to ensure that any cultural resource sites would be
considered. Archeological fieldwork was conducted during February 2009, and included a pedestrian survey
accompanied by 722 shovel tests. Recovered artifacts included prehistoric ceramics, flakes, and tools and will be
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Two new prehistoric sites were discovered and the
location of one previously recorded site was investigated. The research potential and National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) eligibility of sites 41JP167 and 41NA310 could not be clearly assessed; these sites have an unknown
NRHP eligibility status and should be avoided. No cultural material was found at the recorded location of site
41TL32 and it is believed to be plotted in error. The actual location of the site is unknown and it was not assessed
for NRHP eligibility. No further work is warranted at the investigated location.

Abstract
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on eight separate parcels of land, totaling 1,319 acres, at Lake
B. A. Steinhagen and Lake Sam Rayburn in East Texas. Work was conducted by Ecological
Communications Corporation at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of the United
States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE has proposed
timber harvesting within the selected tracts and, in compliance with Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act, the inventories were conducted to ensure that any cultural resource
sites located on the parcels would be considered in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archeological fieldwork was conducted between February 4 and 15, 2009, and included a 100
percent pedestrian survey accompanied by manual excavation of 722 shovel tests. Recovered
artifacts included prehistoric ceramics, lithic flakes, and tools. All subsurface artifacts were
recovered and will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Two new prehistoric sites (41JP167, 41NA310) were documented and the location on record of
one previously recorded site (41TL32) was investigated. The research potential and National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility of prehistoric sites 41JP167 and 41NA310 could
not be clearly assessed using the limited shovel test inventory tactics. These two sites have an
unknown NRHP eligibility status and should be avoided and protected from adverse impacts.
No cultural material was found at the plotted location of site 41TL32 and it is believed to be
plotted in error. The actual location of the site is unknown and it was not assessed for NRHP
eligibility. No further work is warranted at the location on record.

Project Description
1.1	The Undertaking
The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally-owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs
and navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 17,461 acres at Lake
Sam Rayburn and 7,943 acres at Lake B. A. Steinhagen (acreages are outside conservation
pools) (Figure 1-1).
While
planning
and
conducting
undertakings
that have the potential to
affect historic properties,
the USACE must consider
such resources. Therefore,
in compliance with Section
106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966
as amended through 1992
(P. L. 89â665 et seq.), the
current inventories were
authorized by the USACE
to identify any archeological
sites, buildings, structures,
or other resources that may
be eligible for inclusion on
the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). All
inventories were conducted
on and all sites are located on
lands owned by the Federal
Government and managed
by the USACE.
Much of the USACE
managed acreage at both
lakes is forested by mature
pine and hardwood stands. In
conjunction with the existing
management plans for the
reservoirs and in accordance

Project Description

with accepted silviculture methodologies, the USACE has planned certain management areas
for selective timber thinning at these lakes. Commercial thinning removes marketable trees in
uneven-aged stands (not clear-cut) through single-tree selection. Removal of crop trees often
disturbs the ground surface, but extensive subsurface disturbance is not common.

1.2	Location
The total project area consists of eight separate parcels (Table 1-1). Four of these parcels are
located at Lake Sam Rayburn in Angelina and Nacogdoches counties, and the remaining four
parcels are located at Lake B. A. Steinhagen in Jasper and Tyler counties, Texas. Together, the
eight parcels total 1,3191 acres and range in size from a minimum of 15 acres to a maximum of
465 acres. Average parcel size was 165 acres.

1.2.1 Lake Sam Rayburn
Congress authorized Lake Sam Rayburn in 1955 for the purposes of flood control along the
Angelina River, hydroelectric power generation, and conservation of water for municipalities,
industry, agriculture, and recreation. USACE began construction of the reservoir in 1956, and
impoundment began in 1965. Initially known as McGee Bend Reservoir, the lake was renamed
in honor of Speaker of the US House of Representatives Sam Rayburn. The lake is the largest
body of water in Texas. The conservation pool level is 164.4 feet (ft) above mean sea level
(amsl) (50.1 meters [m] amsl), and the lake has approximately 750 miles (1,207 kilometers
[km]) of shoreline (Figure 1-1). The current inventory includes four parcels totaling 760 acres.

The original task order called for survey of 1,316 acres; however, as a result of a data transfer error, it
was decided to switch one of the original parcels to the Dorty Creek parcel. Therefore, the final area surveyed was
1,319 acres.

1.3	Natural Environment
The project area is located in the Oak-Hickory-Pine Forest vegetation region of East Texas
as defined by Gould (1969). Forested areas in the parcels included secondary growth and
mature pine and pine-hardwood stands (Figure 1-10). Pine stands observed during the field
inventory typically consisted of loblolly (Pinus taeda), shortleaf (Pinus echinata), and
longleaf (Pinus palustris) pines. Hardwood trees noted during the survey included southern
red oak (Quercus falcate), white oak (Quercus alba), and American sycamore (Platanus
occidentalis). Other hardwoods in the area include sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua),
bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), black walnut (Juglans nigra L.), osage orange (Maclura
pomifera), and Dahoon holly (Ilex cassine).
The project area is located in the Austroriparian biotic province as defined by Blair (1950).
Wildlife common to the area includes whitetail deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red fox (Vulpes
vulpes), bobcat (Felis rufus), grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), coyote (Canis latrans),
raccoon (Procyon lotor), opossum (Didelphus virginiana), wild hog (Sus scrofa), nutria
(Myocastor coypus), river otter (Lutra canadensis), and mink (Mustela vison). Lake habitats
support a variety of turtles, frogs, and snakes, as well as largemouth bass (Micropterus
salmoides salmoides), flathead (Pylodictis olivaris) and channel (Ictalurus punctatus)
catfish, white (Pomoxis annularis) and black (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) crappie, white
bass (Morone chrysops), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), and other sunfish. Bird species
include the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), as well as bald eagles
(Haliaeetus leucocephalus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), bobwhite (Colinus virginianus),
mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), white pelicans (Elecanus erythrorhynchos), common
loons (Gavia immer), herons (Ardea spp.), and egrets (Egretta spp.).

Project Description

1.4	Geology and Soils
1.4.1 Underlying Geological Formations
The four Lake B. A. Steinhagen parcels are located entirely within Holocene Quaternary
alluvium (Qal), representing approximately 12,000 years of alluvial floodplain deposition. At
Lake Sam Rayburn, the Vistador Creek and Carrizo Bayou parcels are located on Qal deposits.
Pleistocene fluvial terrace deposits (Qt) were encountered in the Kingtown and Dorty Creek
parcels. The Eocene-aged Cook Mountain formation is mapped on elevated areas encountered
on the western half of the Dorty Creek parcel as well as on the southern portions of the Carrizo
Bayou and Vistador Creek parcels (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 2004).

1.4.2 Soil Formations
Lake Sam Rayburn
Eight soil types are mapped in the four inventory parcels at Lake Sam Rayburn (Table 1-2)
(Soil Survey Staff 2009). The following contains a brief description of each series.
The Mantachie series consists of somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils. They
formed in loamy alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. They usually flood late in winter
and early in spring. The seasonally high water table is at a depth of 30â46 centimeters (cm).
Slope is predominantly less than 1 percent, but ranges to 3 percent. Mantachie soils comprise
approximately 70 percent of the area in the Vistador parcel.
The Marietta series consists of deep, moderately well-drained soils on wide floodplains.
Permeability is moderate. These are nearly level soils that formed in loamy alluvium along
streams that drain parts of the Blackland Prairie and Southern Coastal Plain Major Land
Resource Areas. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Marietta soils comprise approximately 30

glauconite. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Hannahatchee soils comprise approximately 20
percent of the area in the Carrizo Bayou parcel.
The Bienville series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly
permeable soils. These soils formed in sandy coastal plain sediments on nearly level or gently
sloping stream terraces. Slope is predominantly 1â3 percent, but ranges from 0 to 5 percent.

soils comprise approximately 29 percent of the area in the Kingtown parcel and approximately
35 percent of the area in the Dorty Creek parcel.
The Mollville series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed
in thick, stratified sandy and loamy sediments. These soils are in nearly level or depressional
positions on stream terraces. Slopes are 0â1 percent. Mollville soils comprise approximately
21 percent of the area in the Kingtown parcel.
The Naclina series consists of residual soils that are deep to shale. They are very slowly
permeable and well drained. These soils are on broad, gently sloping to steep coastal plains. The
slope is predominantly 5â10 percent but ranges from 1 to 35 percent. Naclina soils comprise
approximately 16 percent of the area in the Dorty Creek parcel.

1.4.3 Archeological Potential of the Soils
The landscape of East Texas and northwestern Louisiana is known as the âsandy mantle,â
and is generally characterized as âweakly consolidated, Tertiary age fluvial-deltaic deposits
of predominantly sandy textureâ (Frederick et al. 2002:191). In Texas, the sandy mantle is
a soil formation that âextends in a slowly expanding pattern from south of San Antonio in a
northeasterly direction into East Texasâ (Nickels and Lehman 2004:107), closely following
the distribution of sandy Eocene deposits, known as the Claiborne formation. All four of the
inventoried parcels near Lake Sam Rayburn are within this geographical feature.
Archeological significance of the sandy mantle area is currently heavily debated because the
age and origin of this formation is unknown (Boulter et al. 2007). Stratigraphically, the sandy
mantle is composed of an AâEâBt pedon, with the Bt pedon dating to the Pleistocene. The
problems encountered with archeological projects located in this area lie in the debate as to
the age of the sands, rather than the formation of the AâE pedons. Some scientists argue that
the formation of the sandy mantle is predominately of pedogenic origins, whereas others argue
that the formation is attributed to colluvial and eolian processes (see Heinrich 1986; Rogers
1994; Thoms 1993). According to Frederick et al. (2002:191â192), if the soils over the Bt
horizon âare the product of in situ pedological weathering of Tertiary bedrock, then the AâEâ
Bt horizon all formed simultaneously from the same parent material.â Accordingly, cultural
material found within these soils is affected by pedoturbation, meaning, âthese sites would
have minimal integrity and would be unworthy of preservation or excavation.â However, if
the soils are a product of colluvial and eolian processes, the underlying argillic formation (Bt
pedons) was already established; therefore cultural material in these soils are in context and
have archeological significance (Frederick et al. 2002:191â192).
Research geared towards understanding the formation of the sandy mantle has beenon going
by various projects in the sandy mantle area (e.g. Boulter et al. 2007; Bruseth and Martin
2001; Frederick et al. 2000, 2002; Nickels and Lehman 2004). One in particular, Fredrick et
al. (2002), provides evidence of eolian deposition on uplands based on optically stimulated
luminescence dating. In their research, 33 samples were collected from an excavated trench at
41LE191. Seven of the samples were collected from the sand above the Bt horizon, one from
the Bt horizon, six from unconsolidated sands, and 19 others from the same profile as a control.
Results of their findings (see Fredrick et al. 2002) show that sands covering the hill at 41LE191
were deposited during the Holocene and were not a product of in situ deposition. This is only
shown for this area; other research shows that it can be applied throughout the sandy mantle
area.
From 2002 to 2003, the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State University-San
Marcos conducted extensive archeological work in the 11,500-acre confines of Camp Swift in
Bastrop County. One of the primary research issues addressed by CAS during their work was
the formation of the sandy mantle. For the survey phase, CAS conducted a study measuring the
depth of the sand deposits based on depths recorded from the excavations of over 800 shovel
tests in 57 different locations in the Camp Swift Texas National Guard base. Their research
compared depths in different settings (i.e. terraces, foot slopes, side slopes, drainage ways,

Ecological Communications Corporation

15

Chapter 1

Project Description

ridges, and uplands), to the vertical distribution of cultural material in these specific locations.
From this research, it was shown that sand depths varied across the landscape, and âthat the
physiographic setting cannot be viewed as an overriding consideration when evaluating site
depth, intensity of use, and integrity;â therefore âsites must be tested on a case-by-case basis
regardless of their settingâ (Nickels and Lehman 2004:124).
In 2002, CAS conducted NRHP eligibility testing on 20 prehistoric sites that included the
excavation of 120 test units and six backhoe trenches. The results of testing revealed stratigraphic
correlations in the data that suggest some sites in the sandy mantel indeed contain deep, intact
deposits of cultural materials. This conclusion was based on data gathered from multi-linear,
corroborating lines of evidence including soil susceptibility values, pH values, statistical data,
artifact densities and sizes, non-artifact densities and sizes, soil horizons, archeomagnetic
samples, projectile point typology, clay lamella development, and 14C samples (David Nickels,
personnel communication 2008; Nickels et al. 2009).
However, the archeological potential of the soils at the four parcels at Lake B. A. Steinhagen
should be regarded as low. These areas are topographically low (averaging 90 ft amsl [27.4
m amsl]), flat wooded marsh and floodplain that features no prominent terraces or ridgelines
where prehistoric occupations in East Texas are generally known to occur (Perttula 2004). In
addition, the area is prone to long-term inundation and frequent flooding, which has resulted in
soils that have a mixed/secondary depositional history with an overall low integrity.

Cultural Context
2.1	Previous Research
2.1.1 Lake Sam Rayburn
The earliest documented archeological investigations near present-day Lake Sam Rayburn
were conducted during the late 1930s by the Works Progress Administration (WPA), under the
direction of Gus Arnold. The WPA reported some 23 sites (Arnold 1940). A decade later, the
River Basin Surveys (RBS), under the direction of Robert Stephenson, recorded 57 additional
sites in the area of the proposed reservoir (Stephenson 1948a, 1948b). This work was followed
in the late 1950s and early 1960s by limited surveys by the Texas Archeological Salvage Project
(TASP) (Davis 1959; Jelks 1965).
Since completion of the reservoir, numerous systematic inventories were conducted on behalf
of the USACE. Between 1993 and 2001, these studies have investigated more than 3,700 acres
and recorded 58 sites (Corbin 2001; Ferring 1993a; Keller 1998; Moore 2001; Nichols 1994;
Skinner and Trask 1999; Trask and Skinner 1998; Trask et al. 1996). Since 2002, a series of
inventories has been conducted by EComm for the USACE in advance of timber thinning
undertakings (Bonine et al. 2004; Jones and Trierweiler 2005, 2006, 2008; Jones et al. 2008;
Trierweiler and Bonine 2002, 2003; Trierweiler et al. 2002).
In total, more than 250 sites were reported in the immediate vicinity of Lake Sam Rayburn.
Of these, fewer than a dozen have been subjected to any subsurface investigations other than
shovel testing. Jelks conducted limited exploratory excavations at nine sites. Three of these
were dug in 1956, including 41SA86 (Runnels No. 2), 41SA87 (Runnels No. 1), and 41SA89
(Sawmill Site), and were subsequently reported by Curtis Tunnell (1961). The following year
Jelks excavated at 41SA94 (Wylie Price Site), 41SB36 (Print Bell Site), and 41SB50 (Walter
Bell Site), followed in 1959 by 41SA101 (Jonas Short Site) (Jelks 1965). In 1961 and 1962,
the Sabine-Neches Archeological Society conducted limited excavations at 41SA83 (Zavonian
Springs). Finally, in 1996 extensive shovel testing was conducted at site 41AG66 to assess the
extent of vandalism (Skinner and Trask 1996). While some of these early investigations have
consisted of fairly extensive testing, no site at Lake Sam Rayburn has been excavated using the
broad exposures typical of recovery excavations.

2.1.2 Lake B. A. Steinhagen
During the late 1930s, the WPA recorded a handful of archeological sites near the now Lake
B. A. Steinhagen (Arnold 1940), and this early work was followed in the 1940s by the RBS
surveys of Stephenson (1948a, 1948b). Approximately a dozen sites were recorded in this

vicinity by these early surveys. In the late 1950s, the TASP recorded several sites at Lake B. A.
Steinhagen, but a report was not produced.
Beginning in the 1980s, numerous systematic surveys have been conducted on USACE fee
lands at Lake B. A. Steinhagen (see Carpenter 1994; Dervin 1982; Ferring 1993a; 1993b;
Leach-Palm and Rader 1995; Perttula et al. 1998). These surveys covered more than 1,100
acres and documented 24 archeological sites. More recently, EComm has conducted several
inventories for the USACE in advance of timber thinning undertakings (Bonine et al. 2004;
Jones and Trierweiler 2006, 2007; Jones et al. 2008; Trierweiler and Bonine 2002, 2003;
Trierweiler et al. 2002). In addition, EComm conducted a linear inventory of 6 km at nearby
Martin Dies Jr. State Park (Bonine 2004).
One site at Lake B. A. Steinhagen has been the target of systematic subsurface investigations.
The Hen House Site (41JP65) was tested in 1977 by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
because of continuing erosion (Chafin-Lohse and Anderson 1979). No data recovery excavations
have been conducted at Lake B. A. Steinhagen sites.

2.2	Previously Recorded Sites
2.2.1 Sites and Prior Surveys in the Inventory Parcels
A map and records search was conducted using the Texas Historical Commission Atlas online
database on January 16, 2009. Only one site (41TL32) was previously recorded within the eight
survey parcels at both lakes. EComm revisited site 41TL32 during the current inventory in the
Wolf Creek parcel (see 4.0 Results). No prior archeological surveys were conducted within
the inventory parcels at either lake. According to the archeological site form for 41TL32, the
location of the site is based on the memory of an artifact collector, and therefore not the result
of a prior survey.

2.2.2 Sites Within One Mile of the Inventory Parcels
Lake Sam Rayburn
Four archeological sites have been recorded within one mile (1.6 km) of the four parcels at Lake
Sam Rayburn. EComm recorded all four of the sites during two surveys conducted in 2002 and
2007 (Jones et al. 2008; Trierweiler et al. 2002). One of the sites is historic (41AG184) while
the remaining three are all prehistoric campsites (Table 2-1).
Lake B. A. Steinhagen
Four previously recorded archeological sites are located within one mile (1.6 km) of the
Lake B. A. Steinhagen inventory parcels (Table 2-2). All of the sites are prehistoric and were
recorded by EComm in 2006 while conducting a survey in Magnolia Ridge Park (Jones and
Trierweiler 2006).

2.3	Cultural Framework
The archeological regions of Texas vary depending on what research is used to determine the
cultural framework of the project area. In some cases, such as in Turner and Hester (1993),
Texas is divided in to nine archeological regions, whereas Perttula (2004) further divides
these regions into 16 distinct archeological regions based on physiographic zones and biotic
communities. According to Turner and Hesterâs divisions, the project is located in the East
Texas Archeological Region, whereas in Perttulaâs (2004) model the project area is located
in Deep East Texas. Whatever that case may be, both models of the archeological regions of
Texas are correct; however, Perttulaâs division better suits the project area ecologically and
physiographically. For the purpose of this report, Perttulaâs (2004), model will be used in
discussing the cultural framework of the region.
The prehistoric cultural framework of the Deep East Texas region includes the Paleoindian
period, Archaic and Woodland periods, and periods of Caddo horticultural adaptation.
Much of the information known about this region has been recorded by many archeological
investigations, beginning in the 1930s. This cultural framework, discussed further below, has
been adapted from Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) and Perttula (1993a, 1993b, 1995, 2004).

Chapter 2

Cultural Context

2.3.1 Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period describes the time in which North America was first occupied by
peoples migrating from the Old World. The occupation of the New World is due in part to
the migration of extinct fauna (e.g. bison, camel, and horse) across the newly open lands and
the people who followed them, relying on these animals for everyday subsistence. Although
this portrayal of the early occupants of North America is generally accepted among some
archeologists, others see the Paleoindian period as a time in which Pleistocene peoples are
separated into Early and Late stages ca. 12,000â8000 BP, based on cultural traditions of tool
technologies (Bousman et al. 2004).
These stages differ from area to area and region to region depending on the data recorded in
those regions. There is a lack of good data in East Texas relating to the Paleoindian period.
While many projectile points such as Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, Scottsbluff, and San Patrice
have been recovered, most were isolated, mixed, found on the surface, or found in excavations
of later contexts (Perttula 2004). The distribution of artifacts suggests that most sites occur in
the valleys of major stream basins and resource-rich areas. Available evidence suggests that
groups occupied small camps, used a generalized toolkit, and were more likely to be highly
mobile hunters and gatherers rather than specialized large-game hunters (Perttula 2004).

2.3.2 Archaic Period
The Archaic period signifies a shift to a less mobile, more generalized subsistence strategy.
This change in subsistence strategies shows a greater exploitation of local environments with
the exploitation of plants and animals located in the immediate vicinity. Along with the change
in subsistence, a change is also seen in lithic technology. Evidence of this is apparent in the
archeological record, as lanceolate-shaped points gave way to stemmed and barbed dart points
and the presence of ground stone increased (Collins 2004). Although Archaic peoples were still
nomadic in nature, travel became more seasonal, utilizing food resources specific to certain
localities.
According to Collins (1995), the Archaic period in Texas lasted approximately 7,500 years,
from 8800 to about 1300 BP, and is divided into three sub-stages: the Early Archaic (8800â
6000 BP), the Middle Archaic (6000â4000 BP), and the Late Archaic (4000â1300 or 1200
BP). However, in the East Texas Archeological Region, reliable dating is not yet available to
unequivocally substantiate these different periods.
During the Early Archaic period, the climate changed from the wet and mild conditions seen
in the Paleoindian stage, to a warmer and drier climate, ultimately leading to severe xeric
conditions during the middle stages of the Early Archaic. These climate changes forced the
peoples of the Early Archaic to broaden their subsistence strategies from hunting bison to
include the exploitation of resources such as acorns, fruits, rodents, deer, and prickly pear (Story
1985:38â39; Weir 1976). Settlement patterns also change during the Early Archaic. Sites are
smaller and more widely distributed, suggesting high group mobility within large territories.

Cultural Resource Inventory of 1,319 Acres at Lake B. A. Steinhagen and Lake Sam Rayburn

Although most Early Archaic sites are only briefly used, they are apt to be concentrated in the
larger drainage areas in the region (Perttula 2004).
The Middle Archaic is characterized by larger sites in major basins in the region, a more
diverse hunting toolkit, the use of ground and polished stone tools, and the increased use of
plant foods as indicated by grinding implements and burned rock features. Possible hearths,
ovens and burned rock concentrations in the region suggest processing and cooking of plant
resources was important (Perttula 2004).
Throughout East Texas, Late Archaic-period sites are relatively common along major streams
and springs in the uplands and on tributary drainages. During the Late Archaic, population
density may have peaked, as evidenced by the apparent increase in the number of sites and
greater distribution of sites over the landscape. The large number and widespread distribution
of sites also suggests limited group mobility, the possible use of more defined territories, and
regular exploitation of localized food resources (Perttula 2004).

2.3.3 Woodland/Early Ceramic Period
The Woodland period (ca. 200 BCâAD 800) is not well defined but is largely identified by
plain ware ceramics, tempered with clay/grog or bone, and by Gary projectile points. At sites
near the Red River, artifact assemblages are largely made up of ceramics, while at other sites
in Northeast Texas, such as near the Sulphur and Sabine rivers, ceramics are not as common.
One explanation for this difference may be possible regional differences in food processing
and diet during this period, all of which may have an effect on the degree of sedentism between
regions (Perttula 2004).
To date, archeological evidence suggests that Woodland populations were hunters and gatherers
living in larger groups and settling in given locations for longer periods than they had during
the Archaic period. There are some instances (e.g., Skibo and Blinman 1999) in which pottery
making is linked to sedentism, perhaps giving reason for these long stays. In some cases, such
as at the Ray Site, small settlements with structures and middens suggest a more concentrated
occupation, but these sites are not as permanent as those seen at later Caddo-period sites in the
region (Perttula 2004). With the exception of sites in the Sulphur and Neches-Angelina river
basins, Woodland sites are not very common throughout much of Northeast Texas, but when
they occur, they are represented by villages and hamlets in the floodplains or on terraces of
larger streams, and also by smaller components in the uplands. No Woodland-period burial
mounds have been documented in the region.

2.3.4 Formative Caddoan Period and Early Caddoan Period
Sites dating to the Formative Caddoan (ca. AD 800â1000) and Early Caddoan periods (ca. AD
1000â1200) are located primarily in the uplands just adjacent to major streams and smaller
tributaries and springs. Settlement locations with fertile soils and good drainage were primarily

Chapter 2

Cultural Context

chosen for habitation and cultivation of maize, squash, and native plants. Permanent settlements
that included structures, middens, pits, and cemeteries, and artifacts such as tools and ceramics
were widespread. Common settlements in the region include hamlets and farmsteads with
rectangular and circular structures, many with associated cemeteries. In addition to small
farmsteads, larger communities, such as the George C. Davis Site on the Neches River, are
also encountered. These large villages are more common during the Early Caddoan period and
continue through the Middle Caddoan period, and include large groups of many structures,
mound centers, and elite burial pits. Distinctive artifacts such as celts, ceramic pipes and
earspools, and diversely decorated ceramic bowls and jars are commonly recovered from
Formative and Early Caddoan sites (Perttula 2004).

2.3.5 Middle Caddoan Period
The majority of archeological sites in Northeast Texas date to the Middle Caddoan period
(ca. AD 1200â1400). These sites continue the trend of diverse ceramic artifacts and larger
settlements with multiple mounds seen at the end of the Early Caddoan period. One example of
such a site is the Oak Hill Village (41RK214), a large village with mounds, middens, and public
structures. Cultivation of maize and squash continued, but there is no evidence of dependence
on maize and other crops until after AD 1300 (Perttula 2004).

2.3.6 Late Caddoan Period
Archeological sites that date to the Late Caddoan period (ca. AD 1400â1680) are abundant in
Northeast Texas. Late Caddoan sites are predominantly found in river basins such as the Red,
Cypress Creek, and Neches river basins. Smaller groups of sites are present in the Angelina,
Attoyac, middle and upper Sabine, and lower Cypress Bayou basins. Most Late Caddoanperiod archeological sites are either large permanent communities, or smaller farmsteads,
both with associated cemeteries. Late Caddoan-period earthen mounds were constructed and
primarily used from AD 1400 to 1540, except in the Red River, where mound construction
and mound shaft burials continued until 1650 or 1700 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). Stable
isotope and bioarcheological evidence from the region indicate that at this time Caddo peoples
were heavily dependent on maize as their main dietary staple.
The Late Caddoan Titus phase (ca. AD 1430â1680) refers to the archeological remains of
Caddo peoples that lived in the northeastern portion of the Texas Piney Woods between the
Sulphur and Sabine rivers. These Caddo peoples lived in a hierarchical and elite-controlled
society. They constructed both small settlements with family cemeteries and large settlements
with status-ranked community cemeteries, and made culturally distinct and diverse ceramics.
Titus Phase sites are usually found on valley terraces and upland slopes, projections, and
basins, and permanent settlements are usually located near freshwater springs (Perttula 2004).

2.3.7 Historic Period
Historic Caddoan Period
Europeans in the region define the Historic Caddoan period (ca. AD 1680â1860) as the
sustained European presence in and occupation of the Caddoan area. It is during this period
that the Caddo and all other Native American groups except the Alabama and Coushatta were
eventually moved from Texas to the Indian Territory. Most Historic Caddoan settlements in the
region were small farmsteads and hamlets with associated household cemeteries. Communities
were composed of many of these farmsteads spread out over large territories. Artifacts
recovered from these sites include a wide variety of Caddoan ceramics, basketry, ornaments,
and bone, stone, and wooden tools. European goods are commonly found on Historic Caddoan
sites after ca. AD 1740 and include guns and gun parts, glass beads, and metal items such as
kettles, hatchets, knives, hoes, lead balls, and silver, brass, and copper ornaments (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993).
European Exploration and Historic Periods
The area around the future Lake Sam Rayburn was re-inhabited by Antonio Gil Ibarvo and his
fellow settlers in 1779 at the location of the previously abandoned mission in the Nacogdoches
area. The Spanish also settled areas to the southeast of Nacogdoches along the Angelina River,
called the Ayish Bayou District, in the late eighteenth century. Shortly after Nacogdochesâ
founding, Ibarvo built a building called the Old Stone Fort for business and administration, and
the settlement became a center for illegal trade between Spanish, French, and Americans (Long
2009; McDonald 1981). Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Nacogdoches was
the central location of politics in East Texas. JoaquÃ­n de Arredondo sacked the town around
1812 for housing supporters of Augustus Magee and Bernardo GuitiÃ©rrez. It became the stage
for a battle in 1832 that helped instigate the Texas Revolution, as well as the center of the
CÃ³rdova uprising 1838 (McDonald 1981).
San Augustine, the only other densely inhabited area during this time, also participated
heavily in political activities and conflicts (Crocket 1932). Although the region was constantly
contested in the 1820s and 1830s, Anglo-American settlers continued to come and set up farms
in what would become Nacogdoches, Angelina, San Augustine, Tyler, and Jasper counties.
Bevilâs Settlement, later called Jasper, was founded in 1824 by John Bevil and became the seat
of Jasper County in 1844 (Smith 1979). The first ferry and port town in the area, Town Bluff,
was settled on the Neches River in 1833 as part of the Lorenzo de Zavalaâs colony. Woodville
was established in 1846 when Tyler County was formed and quickly established itself as the
county seat.
By 1844, after the Regulator-Moderator War in the east, most of the area had seen the last of
openly violent conflict (McCroskey 2009). However, a new conflict was brewing that eventually

Cultural Context

erupted into the Civil War. Mostly Southerners who carried the slave-run plantation culture
with them settled the region. Unlike their neighbors to the north, much of the environment was
not conducive to cotton production, so many who remained in the area were poor farmers with
few or no slaves, relying on subsistence agriculture, corn, and hogs, as well as some tobacco,
rice, and cattle. Steamboats ferried corn, cotton, and other products down the Angelina and
other navigable rivers to markets in the east, and many towns derived their income from
port fees. As a result, the reaction of the regionâs inhabitants to secession was mixed. The
Mexican population in Nacogdoches did not approve of secession, but the area eventually
voted to support the cause (Long 2009). Angelina County was one of the few in the state to
reject secession altogether (Boon 1937). The other counties to the south and east stuck to their
Southern roots and supported the action, sometimes by an overwhelming margin. Once the
Civil War began, all the inhabitants of the region supported the Confederate Army, supplying
troops and some iron goods. San Augustine was occupied by Confederate troops to guard
against invasion, but no battles were fought in the area.
The towns of Nacogdoches, Woodville, and Jasper were occupied by Union troops during
Reconstruction, and some KKK-like organizations were formed to force African-American
activists out of the area; however, these organizations dissolved soon after they were created.
The region suffered economically after the Civil War, and it did not begin to recover until the
railroads were built in the 1880s. All but San Augustine County had railroads built by the end
of the nineteenth century, and this mode of transportation enabled lumbering to develop in
full force. Towns such as Colmesneil, Rockland, Browndell, Zavilla, and Broaddus sprung up
around new sawmills, and existing towns began to harvest nearby timber for a new source of
income (St. Clair and St. Clair 1982; Wooster 2009). However, poor timber renewal practices
and the Depression caused timber sales to plummet in the 1930s, and several small towns were
deserted. In most areas, raising livestock began to replace what little cotton production was
present, and modest oil extraction was developed to support the economy in Nacogdoches
and Jasper counties. However, the primary economy remained agricultural, and the people
maintained a steady rural lifestyle. Timber harvesting was revived during and after World
War II, but not to the extent of previous years. Other areas began planting sugar cane, raising
poultry, and manufacturing tung (to make lacquer). Lake Sam Rayburn was completed in 1965,
and tourism helped to revive the regional economy.

Chapter 3

Methods
The archeological pedestrian survey was conducted over a period of 11 workdays between
February 4 and 15, 2009. Approximately 44 person-days were spent in the field. Methods and
density of shovel testing complied with or exceeded the minimum requirements for field tactics
stipulated by the USACE for archeological inventories in East Texas (USACE 2007:39â51).

3.1	Survey Tactics
For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance with transect lines indicated at 20-m
intervals on aerial photographs. Each field archeologist was given a copy of the aerial and was
assigned a transect line and a targeted number of shovel tests. Transect lines were designated
with an alpha prefix and individual shovel tests along each transect line were numbered, so that
shovel test G-5 identified the fifth test along the seventh transect (Transect G). In general, each
crewmember followed his/her own transect, walking in parallel with the other crewmembers.
Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two crewmembers doubled up with one person digging the
shovel tests and another screening and recording the field forms, or two crew members would
âleapfrogâ along one transect, each digging alternating shovel tests. While approximately even
coverage was attempted, surveyors deviated from transect alignments in order to test high
probability locations. Tests were selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research
to be preferred site locations, such as ridgelines, knolls, and promontories. Areas of obvious
deep disturbance, such as those affected by bulldozing, were noted on the field maps and were
excluded from shovel testing. Similarly, areas that were completely inundated were excluded
from transect coverage, including low swampy areas, ponds, and all areas underneath current
lake levels.
Recent debris, such as aluminum cans, beer bottles and plastic detritus was commonly observed,
but no further attention was paid to such items clearly less than 50 years old.
All shovel tests were 30â35 cm in diameter. All tests were dug to the bottom of the Holocene
deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cm below ground surface if no clay was present. Tests
were individually recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and cultural material
present. Tests were dug in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness and
all excavated material was screened through Â¼-inch (6.4 mm) mesh. At the start and end of
transects, at all positive shovel tests, and at selected other tests, GPS readings were taken to
verify transect and shovel test locations.
All cultural material in shovel tests was collected, with the exception of recent objects such
as bottle glass shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These were assumed to indicate recent
disturbance and were not collected. All shovel tests were backfilled.

Chapter 3

Methods

Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in
the immediate vicinity at 5- to 30-m distances for up to six tests in an area. If more than
one of these tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test,
then the location was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an
isolated occurrence. The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were collected,
but these were not further recorded. The locations of previously recorded sites were similarly
investigated using multiple shovel tests. On each site, a permanent site datum was established
using a 12-inch iron rebar fixed with an aluminum tag. Tags were stamped with âECOMM 2009â
and with a temporary field site number for newly recorded sites.
Site boundaries were delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify zones
of zero or low artifact presence. Generally, these were in cardinal directions from the initial
positive test, unless topography suggested an alternative tactic. Site boundaries were defined
based on subsurface artifact distribution, complemented by surface artifacts and features (where
present), topography, soil exposures, and other relevant criteria. Additionally, sites along the
shoreline were visually inspected for artifact distribution, and site size was determined by the
extent of the surface artifacts. Based on the distribution of negative shovel tests or absence of
surface artifacts, site boundaries were prominently marked with fluorescent pink flagging tape.
Sites were photographed, sketched, and mapped, and all site data were recorded onto State of
Texas site data forms. All recovered artifacts were processed and analyzed by the authors of
this report in ECommâs Austin laboratory. Artifacts, notes, and records will be curated at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL).

3.2	Density of Shovel Testing
The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum, one shovel
test was to be excavated per three acres (0.33 tests per acre). Using this rate of coverage, a
minimum of 440 shovel tests was required to inventory the 1,319 acres (Table 3-1). Field
crews attempted to exceed this rate of coverage, and 722 shovel tests had been dug at the
conclusion of fieldwork. This number exceeds the required minimum by 282 tests. Intensity
of shovel testing varied from parcel to parcel depending on ground visibility, vegetation, and
topography. Shovel testing density varied from a minimum of 0.41 tests per acre at the Dorty
Creek parcel at Lake Sam Rayburn to a maximum of 0.66 tests per acre at the Fussell Place
parcel at Lake B. A. Steinhagen. For the project as a whole, final coverage averaged 0.55 tests
per acre.

3.3	Evaluation of Significance
Historic properties may be nominated for inclusion on the NRHP, or may be determined eligible
for such nomination, under evaluation criteria that are expressed at 36 CFR Â§ 60.4:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology,
engineering and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures,
and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials,
workmanship, feeling, and association (36 CFR Â§60.4).
Significance is further defined in four criteria. Cultural resources are considered significant if:
a) they are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or
b) they are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
c) they embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method
of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
component may lack individual distinction; or
d) they have yielded, or may be likely to yield information important in prehistory
or history (36 CFR Â§60.4).
Cultural resources may qualify for inclusion on the NRHP under any of the four evaluation
criteria. In this study, prehistoric sites were evaluated for significance and with respect to
National Historic Preservation Act Criterion D. The demonstrated data content of each site
were compared to the important research contexts as outlined above. Sites in good condition
and state of preservation with several data types bearing on one or more of the research

Methods

contexts were evaluated as significant under Criterion D. Those sites that were observed to
be in poor condition or state of preservation and/or sites with no data types bearing on one or
more of the research contexts were evaluated as not significant. Finally, sites that could not be
satisfactorily investigated using the survey level tactics employed by this study were classified
as of unknown significance.

4.4	Kingtown Parcel
The Kingtown parcel totaled 122 acres and was inventoried using 72 shovel tests, for a net
density of 0.59 shovel tests per acre (Figure A-4). The survey resulted in the discovery of
one new prehistoric site within the parcel, 41NA310. See Appendices B and C for the site
location on the USGS topographic quadrangle and the completed State of Texas site form.

4.4.1 Site 41NA310
Site 41NA310 (Figures 4-4 and 4-5) is a newly discovered prehistoric campsite located in
the southern portion of the Kingtown parcel. The site is situated on an elevated terrace north
of and adjacent to the Angelina River channel at an elevation of 155 ft amsl (47.2 m amsl).
The site measures approximately 180 x 120 m. Vegetation noted at the site included mixed
stands of hardwood and pine, and soils fall within the Bienville series. Surface visibility
was
approximately
90
percent along the shoreline
and 10 percent on the
wooded terrace.
The site was initially
discovered
when
three
sandstone fire-cracked rocks
and two Woodland-period
ceramic sherds were found
along the shoreline while
conducting the pedestrian
survey. Shortly afterward, 17
shovel tests were excavated
on the elevated terrace to
determine site size and the
nature of cultural resource
deposition
(Table
4-2).
Artifacts were recovered
from eight of the 17 tests
(47 percent). The shovel
test assemblage consists of
nine lithic flakes collected
in one component between
20 and 80 centimeters below
surface (cmbs). The majority
of flakes were manufactured
from petrified wood, though
one chert flake was noted.

new prehistoric site within the parcel, 41JP167. See Appendices B and C for the site location
on the USGS topographic quadrangle and the completed State of Texas site form.

5.3.1 Site 41JP167
Site 41JP167 (Figures 5-3 and 5-4) is a newly discovered prehistoric campsite located 100
m south of the Angelina River in the northern portion of the Spring Creek parcel. The site is
situated along a narrow, slightly elevated ridgeline (85 ft amsl [25.9 amsl]) that surrounds a
low marshy swamp, and is immediately south of two eastâwest running sloughs that appear to
be abandoned channels of the Angelina River. An oxbow lake (named Moon Lake) is located
90 m to the southeast. The site measures approximately 203 x 140 m. Vegetation noted at the
site included mixed stands of hardwood and pine and soils fall within the Besner-Mollville
complex. Surface visibility was approximately 10 percent.
The site was discovered at the location of Shovel Test (ST) 1. Nine additional shovel tests were
excavated for a total of 10 tests (Table 5-2). Artifacts were recovered from three of the 10 tests
(30 percent). The assemblage consists of four lithic flakes, one biface, and one uniface. The
uniface and all the flakes were manufactured from petrified wood, while the biface was made
from brown chert. Depths of these items range widely, from two items at 0â20 cmbd to one
item at 100â120 cmbd. While not verified, the possibility of different stratigraphic components

between 60 and 80 cmbs in ST 7.

5.4	Wolf Creek Parcel
The Wolf Creek parcel totaled 39 acres and was inventoried using 20 shovel tests, for a net
density of 0.51 shovel tests per acre (Figure A-8). One previously known site (41TL32) was
revisited. See Appendices B and C for the site location on the USGS topographic quadrangle
and the completed State of Texas site form.

5.4.1 Site 41TL32
Site 41TL32 is a previously known prehistoric campsite that was originally recorded in 1986
by Sheldon Kindall of the Houston Archeological Society. The location is believed to be one
of the many sites from which Andy Kyle collected points between 1946 and 1986. However,
the reported site location was primarily the result of Kindallâs interpretation of Kyleâs
personal maps, and was not the result of an actual field survey. On TARL maps, the site is
shown as 390 x 320 m in size (Figure 5-5). It is plotted along Wolf Creek at an elevation of
80 ft amsl (24.4 m amsl), approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) north of the intersection of CR 92
and State Highway (SH) 190.
EComm visited this location and attempted to document the site. Vegetation noted included
mixed stands of hardwood and pine, and soils fall within the Iulus-Bleakwood series. The
surface visibility was approximately 10 percent and no artifacts were observed on the ground
surface. Ten shovel tests were excavated within the mapped location of the site but no artifacts
were observed within any shovel test.

Summary and Recommendations
This cultural resources inventory investigated eight parcels at Lakes Sam Rayburn and B. A.
Steinhagen in Angelina, Jasper, Nacogdoches, and Tyler counties. The parcels ranged in size
from 15 acres (Fussell Place parcel) to 465 acres (Spring Creek parcel), and the total area
inventoried was 1,319 acres. Field methods included a pedestrian inventory at 20-m intervals,
accompanied by excavation of 722 shovel tests. Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in
diameter and were dug either to the clay horizon or to 80 cmbs. Overall testing density for the
project was 0.58 tests per acre.
The inventory documented two new archeological sites and investigated the location of one
previously recorded site. No intact historic building or structure greater than 50 years old was
present in any of the inventory areas.
Site 41JP167 is a newly discovered prehistoric site 203 x 140 m in size, located 100 m
south of the Angelina River along a narrow ridgeline that surrounds a low marshy swamp.
Ten shovel tests were excavated, and six lithic artifacts were recovered in what may be
three possible components at 0â40, 60â80, and 100â120 cmbs. In addition, some charcoal
fragments were observed in two shovel tests between 20 and 40 cmbs and between 60 and 80
cmbs. Based on the limited data collected on the site, its NRHP eligibility status is considered
unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then further
investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural resource deposition and
the siteâs NRHP eligibility.
Site 41NA310 is a newly discovered 180 x 120-m prehistoric campsite located on an elevated
terrace north of and adjacent to the Angelina River channel at an elevation of 155 ft amsl
(47.2 m amsl). Seventeen shovel tests were excavated within the site. Nine lithic flakes
were recovered between 20 and 80 cmbs from eight of the tests. In addition, three sandstone

Summary and Recommendations

fire-cracked rocks and two ceramic sherds that date to the Woodland period were recorded on
the ground surface. Based on the limited data collected on the site, its NRHP eligibility status is
considered unknown and the site should be avoided. If avoidance is deemed impractical, then
further investigations may be necessary to determine the extent of cultural resource deposition
and the siteâs NRHP eligibility.
Site 41TL32 is a previously known prehistoric campsite that was recorded in 1986 by Sheldon
Kindall of the Houston Archeological Society. The site is believed to be one of the sites
from which Andy Kyle collected points between 1946 and 1986, but the currently plotted
site location of 41TL32 is only a decades-later interpretation. EComm visited the location on
record and excavated 10 shovel tests, but no artifacts were observed during shovel testing or on
the surface. Based on these negative results, the currently plotted site location is believed to be
in error. The actual site location is unknown. Because the site was not found, it is not assessed
for NRHP eligibility. As the plotted location has no cultural resources, no further archeological
work is necessary.
