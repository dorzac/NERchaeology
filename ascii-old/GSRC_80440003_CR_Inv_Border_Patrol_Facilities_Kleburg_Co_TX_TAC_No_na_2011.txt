ABSTRACT
Gulf South Research Corporation personnel conducted an intensive cultural resources survey on
three alternative site locations (Sites 1, 2, and 3) for the construction, operation, and maintenance
of a new United States (U.S.) Border Patrol (USBP) station in Kingsville, Kleberg County,
Texas. The three alternative site locations totaled approximately 79.7 hectares (197 acres). The
project areas were subjected to pedestrian surveys at 30 meter (100 foot) intervals, examining the
surface for any cultural material. Three archaeological sites (41KL97, 41KL98, and 41KL99)
were identified during the cultural resources survey of the alternative site locations. All three
archaeological sites were recorded at Alternative Site 3. A total of 2,972 artifacts were recorded
during the survey of three parcels with 1,554 artifacts recorded at 41KL97; 1,121 artifacts
recorded at 41KL98; and 297 artifacts recorded at 41KL99. Site 41KL97 represents a late
nineteenth to early twentieth century farmstead. Site 41KL98 represents the remains of probable
middle nineteenth to early twentieth century farm worker building. Finally, site 41KL99
probably represents a middle to late twentieth century trash pile or temporary military camp.
Given the low integrity of all three sites and the nature of the deposits, the sites have limited
information potential and are not recommended eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places (NHRP) under any criteria. No further work is recommended for any of the
archaeological sites recorded.
No above ground resources were recorded within the boundaries of Alternative Sites 1, 2, or 3.
Structures and buildings that are 50 years old or older are located adjacent to Alternative Sites 2
and 3. If Alternative Site 2 or 3 is chosen for the proposed station then a formal evaluation of
those structures would be needed to determine if they are eligible for the NRHP. If they are
determined eligible, then an effect determination would be needed to address potential visual
effects to those structures. In addition, the King Ranch Historic District, is located within the 0.8
kilometers (0.5 mile) visual Area of Potential Effect (APE) of Alternative Site 2. The portion of
the historic district within the visual APE consists of undeveloped pasture/range land. No above
ground resources associated with the King Ranch historic district are located within the visual
APE.
Alternative Site 1 is considered to be preferred site location for the proposed station. No historic
properties are located within or adjacent to Alternative Site 1. As a result, no historic properties
would be affected from development of Alternative Site 1. Additional evaluation of structures
and buildings that are 50 years old or older would be needed only if Alternative Site 2 or 3 are
selected.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Gulf South Research Corporation conducted an intensive cultural resources survey on three
alternative site locations (Alternative Sites 1, 2 and 3) for the construction, operation, and
maintenance of a new United States (U.S.) Border Patrol (USBP) station in Kingsville, Texas.
The proposed alternate locations are within Kleberg County, Texas. Mr. John Lindemuth served
as the principal investigator for the project and Mr. Kreg Ellzey and Mr. Nicholas Bourgeois
served as field archaeologists. Fieldwork was conducted from June 18 to June 21, 2010 by Mr.
Lindemuth, Mr. Ellzey, and Mr. Bourgeois. The surveys were conducted for the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Galveston District under Contract Number W9126G-09-D-0067-DZ03. The
three proposed alternative site locations had a total area of approximately 79.7 hectares
(197 acres).
Archaeological sites were only recorded at one of the alternative sites, Alternative Site 3. Three
archaeological sites (41KL97, 41KL98, and 41KL99), were identified during the cultural
resources survey of this alternative site location. A total of 2,972 artifacts were recorded during
the survey, with 1,554 artifacts recorded at 41KL97; 1,121 artifacts recorded at 41KL98; and 297
artifacts recorded at 41KL99. Site 41KL97 represents a late nineteenth to early twentieth
century farmstead. Site 41KL98 represents the remains of probable middle nineteenth to early
twentieth century farm worker building. Finally, site 41KL99 probably represents a middle to
late twentieth century trash pile or temporary military camp. Given the low integrity of all three
sites and the nature of the deposits the sites have limited information potential and are not
recommended eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under any criteria.
No further work is recommended for any of the archaeological sites recorded.
No above ground resources were recorded within the boundaries of Alternative Sites 1, 2, or 3.
Structures and buildings that are 50 years old or older are located adjacent to Alternative Sites 2
and 3. If Alternative Site 2 or 3 is chosen for the proposed station, then a formal evaluation of
those structures would be needed to determine if they are eligible for the NRHP. If they are
determined eligible, then an effect determination would be needed to address potential visual
effects to those structures. In addition, the King Ranch Historic District, is located within the 0.8
kilometers (0.5 mile) visual Area of Potential Effect (APE) of Alternative Site 2. The portion of
the historic district within the visual APE consists of undeveloped pasture/range land. No above
ground resources associated with the King Ranch historic district are located within the visual
APE.
Alternative Site 1 is considered to be preferred site location for the proposed station. No historic
properties are located within or adjacent to Alternative Site 1. As a result, no historic properties
would be affected from development of Alternative Site 1. Additional evaluation of structures
and buildings that are 50 years old or older would be needed only if Alternative Site 2 or 3 are
selected.

INTRODUCTION

United States (U.S.) Customs and Border Protection, (CBP) proposes the construction, operation,
and maintenance of a new U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) station in Kingsville, Texas (Figure 1-1).
The proposed new station would be constructed to accommodate existing USBP agents and staff
assigned to the Kingsville Station and ancillary facilities. The new station would also
accommodate vehicle maintenance and building maintenance staff, who are currently in separate
buildings at great distances from the existing USBP station and responsible for servicing a large
area of the northern portion of the USBP Rio Grande Valley Sector (i.e., USBP Falfurrias and
Corpus Christi stations and other USBP facilities north toward the Texas/Louisiana border). The
new station is also being planned to accommodate the anticipated increase in agent force in
support of the National Border Patrol Strategy to gain and maintain effective control of the U.S.
borders (CBP 2005).
Based upon initial site designs, it has been determined that a 12.1- to 16.2-hectare (ha) (30- to
50-acre[ac]) project site is sufficient in size to accommodate facilities supporting approximately
350 personnel, including USBP agents, support staff, and vehicle and building maintenance staff.
The new station would be designed to qualify for Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design Silver certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. The proposed new station would
include some or all of the following components:

Warehouse storage facility
Vehicle washing stations
Canine facility for up to 35 dogs
Parking, including a sallyport and
covered parking
Fuel island
Impounded vehicle area
Room for unimproved helicopter
landing pad

The vehicle service and maintenance facility would have space for parts storage, vehicle lifts, a
grease and oil station, and a tire changing station, including wheel balance and alignment. A fuel
bay island is currently planned and would consist of four above ground storage tanks (AST): one
15.1 kiloliter (4,000-gallon) AST for diesel; two 45.4 kiloliter (12,000-gallon) ASTs for
unleaded gasoline; and one 45.4 kiloliter (12,000-gallon) AST for E85 (ethanol) fuel. A vehicle
rinse area with an oil-water separator component, vehicle impound lot, and stormwater detention
basin would be incorporated into the station design.

Other site elements include a self supporting radio tower with communications building or space
in the main building, and standby/backup power generator(s) as required. The tower height is
currently unknown and would be dependent on communication needs and would have to
conform to Naval Air Station (NAS) Kingsville airspace requirements; however, it is expected to
be less than 200 feet tall. The proposed new station would also include short-stay and long-term
canine kennels for up to 35 dogs. Utilities (electricity, gas, water, sewer service, and telephone)
for the new station would be installed. Additionally, a water storage tank may be necessary to
provide additional supply and pressure for fire suppression.
Three alternative sites for the new Kingsville Station have been identified as viable sites based
on a site selection survey prepared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Galveston
District (Figure 1-2). Alternative Site 1 is located along Farm to Market (FM) Road 1356, east
of Golf Course Road, and approximately 1.2 kilometers (km) (0.75 mile [mi]) west of the NAS
Kingsville main gate (Figure 1-2). The site is currently in agricultural production (sorghum). A
church and sewer repair company are located at the corner of the FM 1356 and Golf Course
Road, on the siteâs western boundary. All utilities are located at or adjacent to the site with the
exception of the sewer mainline which will require an extension to access the site. The new
sewer line would be located adjacent to FM 1356. Access to the site would be provided on FM
1356. Construction of the station at this site would require purchasing a parcel which is
approximately 20.2 ha (50 ac). It is anticipated that only 16.2 ha (40 ac) would be developed and
portions would remain unimproved.
Alternative Site 2 is located on East Caesar Avenue, approximately1 km (0.65 mi) east of U.S.
Highway 77 (US 77) (Figure 1-2). The site is in sorghum production. A natural gas line borders
the western boundary of the site and a public water line is approximately 0.6 km (0.4 mi) to the
west. Sewer lines would have to be installed and would have to cross US 77, approximately 1.1
km (0.70 mi) away. Texas Department of Transportation has plans to construct an overpass at
US 77 and Caesar Avenue, but there is currently no funding; therefore, there is no current
schedule for construction. According to USBP agents, this is a very busy and dangerous
intersection that experiences numerous fatal accidents each year. Construction of the station and
associated facilities at this site would require approximately 15 ha (37 ac).
Alternative Site 3 is located in the northeast section of the junction of Senator Carlos Truan
Boulevard and FM 3320 (Figure 1-2). Site 3 is currently in cotton production. Access to the site
would be provided from Senator Carlos Truan Boulevard. A natural gas line bisects the site
from southwest to northeast. A public water line also transects the western portion of the site
from south to north. These two easements would have to be incorporated in the layout/design of
the station since no buildings (only driveway/parking) could be constructed over the pipeline
easements. Construction of the station at this site would require approximately 12.1 to 16.2 ha
(30 to 40 ac). Although the site is 31.2 ha (77 ac), it is anticipated that not all of the project site
would be developed and portions would remain unimproved.

Mr. John Lindemuth served as the principal investigator for the project. Mr. Lindemuth, Mr.
Ellzey and Mr. Nicholas Bourgeois conducted the shovel testing on the three alternative sites
(Alternative Sites 1, 2 and 3) from June 18 to June 21, 2010. The total acreage surveyed was
79.7 ha (197 acres). The three proposed alternative sites had good surface visibility
(40-100 percent). These parcels were surveyed in 30 meters (m) (100 feet [ft]) transects and the
surface was examined for any cultural material. The surveys were conducted for the USACE,
Galveston District under Contract Number W9126G-09-D-0067-DZ03.
Mr. Lindemuth served as the author of the cultural resources management report. Section 1 of
the report provides a general introduction of the project and Section 2 provides an environmental
background of the project including the soils, vegetation, and surface visibility of each proposed
station area. Section 3 provides a cultural overview of the project area including a cultural

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

Kleberg County is located in the Coastal Prairies and lies on the mainland as well as Padre
Island. Kleberg County is bounded on the western border by Jim Wells County, Kenedy County
to the south, Nueces County to the north, and Brooks County to the southwest. The county
covers a total area of 2,824 square kilometers (km2) (1,090 square miles [mi2]) of which 2,209
km2 (853 mi2) lies on the mainland with the remaining being split between 46 km2 (18 mi2) on
Padre Island and 568 km2 (219 mi2) of water. The terrain is generally flat with elevations
ranging from nearly sea level to 45 m (150 ft) above sea level). A number of creeks dissect the
county including the San Fernando, Santa Gertrudis, Escondido, and Los Olmos which flow into
the Callo de Grullo and Baffin Bay. The alternative sites consist of three parcels of land totaling
approximately 79.7 ha (197 ac) (Coalson 2010).
The climate of Kleberg County is humid-subtropical with an average minimum temperature of
8.9Âº Celsius (C) (48Âº Fahrenheit [F]) in January and an average high temperature of 35.6Âº C
(96Âº F) in July. The growing season averages 314 days a year and the average annual
precipitation is 67.3 centimeters (cm) (26.5 inches [in]) (Coalson 2010).
2.1

GEOLOGY AND SOILS

All of the proposed USBP station alternative sites lie within the Beaumont formation, which is a
Pleistocene formation (Barnes 1975). The units encompassing the alternative sites are described
as dominantly clay and mud of low permeability with a high to very high shrink-swell potential.
These units generally include interdistributary muds, abandoned channel-fill muds, and fluvial
overbank muds.
Soils within Alternative Site 1 consist of Victoria clays (VcA), 0 to 1 percent slopes. The
Victoria series consists of dark, calcareous, crumbly soils that crack when they dry and swell and
take in water slowly when they are wet. The surface layer ranges from very dark gray
(10YR3/1) to almost black (10YR2/1) in color and ranges from 38 to 102 cm (15 to 40 in) in
thickness. The subsoil is pale brown (10YR6/3) in the upper part which grades to a pale yellow
(2.5Y7/3) or very pale brown (10YR7/3) in its lower part and is approximately 46 cm (18 in)
thick. Victoria clays are a vertisol whose parent materials are clayey fluviomarine deposits of
late Pleistocene age (Web Soil Survey 2010).
Alternative Site 2 is also predominantly VcA with a small areas on the northern and southern
portions being comprised of Cranell sandy clay loam (CaN), 0 to 1 percent slopes. The Cranell
series soils typically have a surface layer comprised of black (10YR2/1) sandy clay loam which
is 18 to 36 cm (7 to 14 in) thick. The subsoil consists of a black (10YR2/1) sandy clay in its
upper portion and a very dark gray (10YR 3/1) sandy clay in its lower portion. Combined
thickness of the subsoil is 25 to 71 centimeters (cm) (10 to 28 inches [in]) (Web Soil Survey
2010).
Alternative Site 3 is also made up of predominantly VcA with small portions comprised of
Banquete clays (BbA) in the northern and northwestern portions of the project area. The BbA
series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in

clayey fluviomarine sediments derived from the Beaumont Formation of Late Pleistocene age.
These soils are nearly level and found in open-ended shallow depressions and swales on flat
plains of the South Texas Coastal Plain. The surface layer is generally 10 to 22 cm (4 to 9 in)
thick and is comprised of a black (10YR2/1) clay. The subsoil ranges from a black (10YR2/1)
clay in its upper portions to a light gray (2.5Y7/1) clay loam in its lower portion and is
approximately 48 to 203 cm (19 to 18 in) in thickness (Web Soil Survey 2010).
2.2

VEGETATION

The proposed sites for a new USBP station are located within the Central Texas Coast Region.
The Central Texas Coast Region starts near Matagorda Bay, and traverses the Victoria and
Corpus Christi areas and ends south of Kingsville. Texas is also divided into natural ecoregions;
the project area is located within the Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes Ecoregion of Texas
(TPWD 2006).
There are no natural vegetation communities on or within the footprint of any of the alternative
sites for the USBP station. The construction footprints and surrounding areas consist of
agricultural fields, residential and urbanized areas, major roadways, or highly disturbed
shrublands. Agricultural lands, especially agricultural margins, generally support non-native and
invasive species adapted to frequent disturbance. Alternative Site 1 was planted in sorghum
during the period of investigations with good ground visibility of 40 to 100 percent. Alternative
Site 2 was also planted in sorghum with ground visibility from 60 to 100 percent. Alternative
Site 3 was planted in cotton during the period of investigation and ground visibility varied
between 40 and 100 percent.
2.3

PALEOENVIRONMENT

The paleoenvironment of the area during the Wisconsin glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 years
Before Present [B.P.]) was considerably cooler and more humid than today. The area was
thought to be covered by grasslands, woodlands, and parklands including species of pine
(Pinus spp.) and spruce (Picea spp.) that are predominantly found today in much cooler
environments. A change to the current Holocene environmental conditions began around 10,000
B.P. though there is some debate over timing and nature of the change with some suggesting a
gradual trend toward warmer and drier conditions over time and other suggesting that the climate
fluctuated throughout the Holocene between drier and wetter conditions (Black 1989a; Ricklis
2004). Though there is not complete agreement on the timing of the Holocene sea level rise,
there is a general consensus that marine transgression was stepwise, with periods of rapid rise
interrupted by intervals of markedly slowed rise, slight regression, or sea level still stand
(Ricklis 2004).
More recent research by Albert (2006) reconstructed the vegetational history of the Central
Texas Coast utilizing pollen data from marsh sediments at Swan Lake on Copano Bay as well as
supporting sequences from Nueces Bay and the Lower Guadalupe River Valley. Three periods
of marine influence were identified at Swan Lake, first at 7100 B.P., then at 4900 B.P., and
finally at 3450 B.P which are defined by high levels of Chenopodiaceae pollen. The presence of
Avicennia pollen in the initial period of marine influence, and in lesser concentrations in the later

two periods of marine influence, is suggestive of a connection between higher sea levels and
warmer climates in the Gulf region. Comparison of the pollen samples collected at Swan Lake
to samples collected from a black mangrove swamp near Bahia Grande in the Rio Grande Delta
indicate that a warmer climate approximating that of the Rio Grande region today was extant as
far north as Coprano Bay between 7100 and 6650 years ago. In contrast, marine still stands are
also identified that are characterized by low Chenopodiaceae values, high freshwater aquatic
pollen levels, and high levels of Quercus pollen; first from 5800 to 5400 B.P., then ca. 3650
B.P., and finally from 3050 B.P. to present (Albert 2006). Table 2-1 below summarizes the
Swan Lake sea level and climatic historical phase developed by Albert (2006) from the analysis
of pollen data.

Long term still stand conditions are attained after 3050 B.P. which encouraged barrier island
formation, low bay salinities, and the establishment of biotically productive freshwater, estuarine
marshlands. Ricklis (1995) proposes that marine transgressions or rises in sea level, promote an
emergence of low-productivity halophytic biomes, while still stand conditions lead to an
emergence of high-productivity estuarine marshes. These fluctuations would also result in
fluctuating intensity of occupations as expressed in the archaeological record.

CULTURAL HISTORY

PREHISTORIC OVERVIEW

The prehistory of the Coastal Bend region, also called the Coastal Texas region can be divided
into four periods: the Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, Late Prehistoric
(Perttula 2004). The Paleoindian period, found in the chronologies of other regions in Texas, is
not represented in the current chronology given the relative lack of Paleoindian sites within the
Coastal Texas region. Though the Paleoindian period is absent in the chronology of the Coastal
Texas region, a general overview for the Paleoindian period in South Texas is presented below
for reference.

ca. 950-250 B.P.

The Coastal Texas region is further divided by Ricklis (2004) into the Central and Lower Texas
Coast based on different cultural traits between the two subdivisions. The proposed Kingsville
sites lie within the Central Texas Coast region as defined by Ricklis.
3.1.1 Paleoindian Period
Initial human occupation of South Texas is thought to have occurred during the Paleoindian
period dating from 9200 B.C to 6000 B.C. (Black 1998b). Evidence of Paleoindian habitation
within the Coastal Bend or Central Texas Coast region is very limited. As a result, Ricklis
(2004) states that the earliest demonstrable human occupation and exploitation of the central
coast shoreline occured during the Early Archaic period. The lack of Paleoindian sites within the
Central Texas Coast region is probably the result of fluctuations in sea level during the terminal
Pleistocene to early Holocene. Bousman et al. (2004) note that no true coastal Paleoindian sites
have been recorded because the Pleistocene coasts were flooded by rising sea levels that
probably inundated such sites.
Bousman et al. (2004) note that the classification of projectile points remains one of the most
important concerns of Paleoindian archaeologists in Texas and the entire cultural historical
framework of Paleoindian archaeology is highly dependent on projectile point classifications.
Fluted lanceolate forms such as Clovis and Folsom point types are the most distinctive
Paleoindian projectile points. In addition, other non-fluted lanceolate forms and some stemmed
points are also known to be associated with Paleoindian deposits. As a result of several
typological problems surrounding the non-fluted lanceolate Paleoindian projectile points, a
comprehensive study was undertaken in 1998 during the Texas Archaeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) Wilson-Leonard Project. This involved a quantitative analysis of projectile
points based on metric attributes. Projectile points analyzed predominantly fell within two broad
morphological categories of 1) non-fluted lanceolate forms and 2) contracting stem and parallel
stem forms. Within the contracting stem forms three point types were identified: Angostura,
Lubbock, and Thrall. Two other groups of projectile points within the contracting stem forms,
Kingsville Station Cultural Resources Survey

Final

comprised of points previously referred to as Midland and Milnesand points, lacked adequate
evidence to support assigning firm type definitions. Parallel stem point forms were further
divided into two general classes, specimens with shallow-to-moderate basal concavities, and
those with deep basal concavities. Projectile point types identified as having shallow-tomoderate concavities included Plainview, St. Maryâs Hall, and Scottsbluff. Point types identified
as having deep basal concavities included atypical St. Maryâs Hall, Golondrina, Barber, and
Dalton types. Stemmed projectile points found in Paleoindian contexts include Wilson, Berclair,
San Patrice, and Big Sandy point types (Bousman et al. 2004). Paleoindian projectile points
found within the South Texas Plains, adjacent to the Central Texas Coast region, include Clovis,
Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura (Black 1989b; Hester 1980).
It was generally thought that the Paleoindian people were big-game hunters with large
herbivores, including extinct Pleistocene species such as the mammoth (Mammuthus spp.) and
bison (Bison bison), being the preferred prey (Black 1989b). As more data are accumulated, a
more generalized subsistence strategy for Paleoindian populations is being proposed.
Subsistence data from early Paleoindian (terminal Pleistocene) sites in Texas show the
exploitation of large game and extinct megafauna such as mammoth, bison, short-faced bear
(Arctodus simus), horse (Equus ferus caballus), and giant armadillo (Priodontes maximus).
Additionally, faunal assemblages from several archaeological sites, such as the Aubrey
(41DN479) and Lewisville (41DN72) also contain a broad range of small taxa. Paleoindian
subsistence and settlement patterns suggest a very low population density in the area, with small
highly mobile bands operating in larger territorial ranges (Black 1989b).
3.1.2 Early Archaic Period
The Early Archaic period (ca. 7500 B.C. to 4200 B.P.) was very similar to the preceding
Paleoindian period. Ricklis (2004) notes that there are two major prehistoric occupations during
the Early Archaic Period centering ca. 7500 to 6800 B.P. and ca. 5800 to 4200 B.P. Evidence of
the initial shoreline occupation dating from 7500 to 6800 B.P. consists of thick but dense lenses
or strata of oyster shells (Crassotrea virginica) which rest at the base of the Holocene deposits
and on top of the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation. Little other faunal material has been
recovered from these early sites with the exception of a single recovered fish otolith. Few lithic
artifacts, consisting of chert debitage, cores, and utilized chert flakes, have been recovered from
the excavated sites dating to this time frame. Another artifact found in these early archaic sites
was an edged flaked sunray venus clamshell knife/scraper (Ricklis 2004).
Evidence for the later Early Archaic period (ca. 5800 to 4200 B.P.) occupation is better
documented. Evidence from this portion of the Early Archaic similarly consists of more or less
thin (5 to 25 cm [2- to 10-in]) strata of oyster shells near shoreline occupations and brackishwater clams (Rangia flexuosa) within river-influenced areas. Artifacts from excavated contexts
are limited but include chert debitage, utilized chert flakes, chert end-scrapers, shell tools
(perforated shell oyster, edge-modified oyster shell), and chert dart points such as Bell, Early
Triangular, Tortugas and Gower point forms. Subsistence data includes fish otoliths representing
several different species including black drum (Pogonias cromis), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion
nebulosis), redfish (Sciaenops ocellata), Atlantic croaker (Micropogon undulatus), and hardhead
catfish (Aurius felis). Although the cultural deposits from this period are generally too old to
preserve most bone, the presence of dart points suggests some hunting was taking place. At

41NU267 some faunal bone was preserved which included bones of fish, deer (Odocoileus spp.),
and rodents (Ricklis 2004).
Diagnostic artifacts of the Early Archaic period in the broader south Texas area include Bell,
Andice, Early Triangular, and Early Expanding Stem dart points as well as large thin triangular
bifaces with concave bases and Guadalupe and unifacial Clear Fork distally beveled tools
(Black 1989b).
3.1.3 Middle Archaic Period
Middle Archaic period (ca. 2500 B.C. to 400 B.C.) sites are more common in south Texas as
compared to sites from previous periods, though radiocarbon data from the Central Texas Coast
shows little occupation of the shoreline (Black 1989b; Ricklis 2004). Given the larger number of
Middle Archaic sites in the larger south Texas area as well as evidence from Choke Canyon,
Loma Sandia and the Coastal Bend area, the Middle Archaic can be viewed as a period of
population growth in the region outside of shoreline occupations (Black 1989b). Within the
Coastal Bend area, there is a continued adaptation to the littoral resources, particularly those of
the estuary bays. Evidence of increased plant utilization for subsistence is also seen during the
Middle Archaic period including the increase in the use of groundstones as well as an increase in
roasting/baking hearths. Acorns and mesquite are suggested as the most likely major plant
resources utilized during this period. In addition, other resources such as land snails, freshwater
mussels, deer, and other mammals were also exploited during the Middle Archaic period.
Artifacts indicative of Middle Archaic sites include the Pedernaes, Langtry, Kinney, and
Bulverde projectile point types as well as medium- to small-sized distally beveled tools.
Groundstone artifacts such as tubular stone pipes, grinding slabs, and manos also become
common in Middle Archaic contexts (Black 1989b). In the Coastal Bend subarea the earliest
Aransas complex materials including Matamoros, Palmillas, Morhiss, and Bulverde points as
well as incised bone, conch columela gouges, and conch adzes start to appear in the Middle
Archaic (Black 1989b).
3.1.4 Late Archaic Period
The Late Archaic period (ca. 400 B.C. to A.D. 800/1200) saw a continued increase in population
from the Middle Archaic period as evident from the increase in Late Archaic period site density.
Subsistence patterns in the Coastal Bend subarea show an exploitation of a wide range of
shellfish, fish, and small mammals with a focus on marine resources, particularly those of
estuary bays. Inland sites show a focus on plant resources but also included the use of a variety
of small mammal such as rodents and rabbits. Artifacts indicative of the Late Archaic Period
include small, corner- or side-notched dart points including Ensor, Frio, Marcos, Fairland, and
Ellis dart points. Small distally beveled tools are also common in Late Archaic assemblages in
south Texas. In the Coastal Bend subarea, later Aransas complex materials are present including
Ensor, Fairland, Darl, CatÃ¡n, and possibly Matamoros dart points (Black 1989b).
3.1.5 Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 800/1200 to A.D. 1600) saw a change from the small
expanding stem dart points of the Late Archaic period to smaller expanding stem arrow points
with the concurrent adoption of the bow and arrow. This transition was fairly rapid throughout
south Texas. Across most of south Texas, the Late Prehistoric period began approximately A.D.
Kingsville Station Cultural Resources Survey

Final

3-4

800 and extended to approximately A.D. 1600. The Late Prehistoric period can be divided into
two subperiods or phases, the Austin Horizon (A.D. 800 to A.D. 1350) and the Toyah horizon
(A.D. 1350 to A.D. 1600) the later part of which encompasses a protohistoric interval after the
initial Spanish contact in A.D. 1528. In the Coastal Bend subarea the Late Prehistoric period
begins later (ca. 1200 A.D.) with the Rockport complex which extends geographically from
Matagorda Bay to Baffin Bay, and the Brownsville complex in the area of the Rio Grande Delta.
The heavy density of Late Prehistoric period sites suggests that there were fairly high population
densities during the Late Prehistoric period. Inland sites tended to be located near water with
sites in upland locations less common. Along the Coastal Bend subarea, Late Prehistoric period
sites seem to be concentrated along the bays, on the barrier islands, and along the brackish water
streams and rivers above the bays. Subsistence data for the Late Prehistoric period has been
predominantly gathered from inland sites due to relatively good preservation. Evidence from the
inland sites of south Texas shows an emphasis on faunal exploitation. Evidence also shows a
large and diverse range of species were utilized. Bison was an important component of Late
Prehistoric subsistence as well as other artiodactyls such as deer and pronghorn (Artilocapra
americana).
In the Coastal Bend subarea, there is also a considerable amount of faunal diversity including a
variety of marine and brackish water species. Generally arrow points and pottery are the
diagnostic artifacts associated with Late Prehistoric sites in South Texas. In the Coastal Bend
subarea, the Fresno (triangular) and Padre (ovate) projectile points are indicative of the earlier
part of the Late Prehistoric period while the Perdiz and Bulbar Stemmed projectile points are
indicative of the later part of the Late Prehistoric period. Bone-tempered pottery is common
during the Late Prehistoric period in inland sites while Rockport pottery is indicative of the
Rockport Complex in the Coastal Bend subarea. Rockport pottery consists of a thin, sandy paste
wares that often have asphaltum (decoration and edge mending) and incised decorations. The
Brownsville complex is dominated by a shell working industry containing various shell tools
(scrapers, gouges, projectile points, etc.) along with other ornaments such as beads, pendants,
gorgets, etc. Stemmed arrow points are virtually absent in the Brownsville complex while
triangular stone arrow points, such as Matamoros, Fresno, Starr, and Cameron, are more
common. Other distinct Late Prehistoric period artifact types in south Texas include stone
beveled knives and small end scrapers, as well as ceramic figurines and smoking pipes. Marine
and mussel shell ornaments and bird bone beads have also been recovered from many Late
Prehistoric period sites (Black 1989b).
By the early nineteenth century the native peoples of the area were either culturally or
biologically extinct or displaced. As a result, the information on the historic Native American
populations of the area are derived predominantly from historic documents from Spanish
expeditions, missionaries, and the earliest Anglo-European explorers and settlers. The Coastal
Bend subarea was inhabited by several different groups of Native Americans during the Historic
Period including the Coahuiltecans, Karankawas, Lipan Apaches, and Tonkawas. These groups
were subdivided into numerous smaller bands including the Atakapa, Borado, Cavas, Capoque,
Emet, Kohani, Kopani, Malaquite, Payata, and Sana Tamique, as well as others (Hester 1989;
Newcombe 2002).

3.2.1 Spanish Exploration Period
The Spanish Exploration period begins with the presence of European explorers, mostly of
Spanish descent in the Coastal Bend region. The first Europeans thought to enter the area were
Alvar NuÃ±ez, better known as Cabeza de Vaca, along with three companions (SÃ¡nchez 1992).
The Panfilo de NarvÃ¡ez expedition, of which Cabeza de Vaca was a member, was shipwrecked
on the upper Texas coast, at a location they described as the Isla del Malhado (SÃ¡nchez 1992;
Hester 1999). The Isla del Malhado was probably Galveston Island or a nearby island, given the
known ethnohistoric and archaeological record (Hester 1999). There is disagreement among
historians, anthropologists and archaeologists on the route taken by Cabeza de Vacaâs group
across Texas. The Krieger route, which takes Cabeza de Vaca from the upper and central Texas
coast, through southern Texas, into northeastern Mexico, and perhaps back into west Texas, is
the most probable of all the routes proposed given the archaeological and ethnohistoric record
(Hester 1999). By 1535, Cabeza de Vaca and his three companions crossed southern Texas,
reaching different points along the Rio Grande (SÃ¡nchez 1992).
3.2.2 The Spanish Colonial Period
No real attempts to settle the area were made until the late seventeenth century in response to a
French settlement established by RenÃ© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle on the Texas Coast in
1568. After an unsuccessful attempt at establishing missions in east Texas during the later part
of the seventeenth century, the Spanish decided that a three-pronged approach which included
mission, presidio and civilian settlement would be the best strategy to establish a Spanish
presence in the area. The Corpus Christi Bay remained unexplored until 1747, when JoaquÃ­n
Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra led an expedition down the Nueces River to its mouth. After
several failed attempts, the first settlement in the area was founded by Blas MarÃ­a de la Garza
FalcÃ²n in 1766. He established a ranch called Santa Petronila, on Petronila Creek. Despite
many ranchers from the Rio Grande Valley applying for and receiving land grants in the lower
Nueces valley during the end of the eighteenth century, the area was slow to develop. By 1794,
a large ranch belonging to Juan Barrera, known as Rancho de Santa Gertrudis, was established
on the north side of Corpus Christi Bay. An Indian uprising in 1812 forced many of the colonists
to seek refuge in the Rio Grande Valley. Hostilities with the Comanches and Lipans in the area
continued until the end of Spanish Control of the region (Long 2010; Fox 1989).

3.2.3 Mexican Colonial Period
With Mexican independence in 1821, the region became part of Tamaulipas. Remaining land in
the area was deeded to individuals by the Tamaulipan government. After several unsuccessful
attempts to establish settlements in the area, Fort LipantitlÃ¡n was established in 1831 where the
road from Matamoros to Goliad crossed the river. Both Irish and German settlers also moved
into the area during the 1820s and 1830s (Long 2010; Fox 1989).
3.2.4 Texas Republic and Nineteenth Century American Period
The Texas Republic period began in 1836 after the Texas Revolution. During this time the
region became a no manâs land with both Mexican and Texan merchants engaging in illegal
trading within the Nueces valley. Henry Lawerence Kinney established a trading post and fort
on Corpus Christi Bay in 1839 in what would become Corpus Christi. By 1842, a post office had
opened, and in 1845 the settlement experienced a brief boom though population declined after
the Mexican War. During this period large-scale ranching rapidly became one of the major bases
of the economy (Long 2010; Fox 1989).
In 1852, Richard King purchased several tracts of land fronting Santa Gertrudis Creek. The first
grant obtained was the Ricon de Santa Gertrudis consisting of approximately 6,273 ha (15,500
ac) of land at the junction of the Santa Gertrudis and San Fernando Creeks near where they join
Laguna Madre. This parcel included the area of present-day Kingsville. King also purchased
Santa Gertrudis de la Garza consisting of approximately 521,853 ha (4,000 ac) of land. It was on
this land that King would begin his cattle operation. In 1860, King founded R. King and
Company, along with partners James Walworth and Mifflin Kenedy, which joined all the land
titles of James Woolworth, King and his wife Henrietta as well as Mifflin Kenedy (Coalson
2010; Chessman 2010; Texas Historical Commission [THC] 1966).
During the Civil War, King and his partners entered into several contracts with the Confederate
government to supply European buyers with cotton while they in return, supplied Confederate
forces with beef, horses, imported munitions, medical supplies, clothing, and shoes. King, who
also owned a steamship company, moved operations of the steamship to Matamoros under
Mexican registry which successfully avoided Union blockades for the most part. At the end of
the war, King fled to Mexico returning after securing his pardon from President Andrew Johnson
in 1865 (Coalson 2010; Chessman 2010; THC 1966).
3.2.5 Twentieth Century American Period
By 1903, the St. Louis, Brownsville, and Mexico Railway was being built through south Texas
to Brownsville and Henrietta King opened several tracts of her land for sale. The town of
Kingsville was laid out in a pasture 5 km (3 mi) east of the ranch headquarters. By 1912, the
population of the town was approximately 4,000 people. With the introduction of the railroad
along with the establishment of Ricardo, a trading center for farmers located on the railroad 10
km (6 mi) south of Kingsville, the economic base of the area began to change from ranching to
farming and dairying. The population continued to rapidly grow in the region during the early
part of the twentieth century and by 1913 the Texas Legislature, prompted by pressure from the
regional population of the area, organized Kleberg County. Kingsville was designated as the
county seat (Coalson 2010).

Several industries in the early to middle twentieth century prompted large population growth in
the county. Oil exploration began early in the region with the first producing well being
discovered in 1919. The first industry in the county was a cotton mill, established in Kingsville
in 1921. Additional population growth came from the establishment of the South Texas
Teachers College (now Texas A&M University at Kingsville) in 1925 (Stokes et al. 2009).
Another population boom in the county came in early 1942 with the establishment of the Naval
Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) 5 km (3 mi) southeast of Kingsville. NAAS Kingsville was one
of several U.S. Naval aviation facilities to be built during World War II to support flight training
in south Texas. Two runways for âP-4â aircraft were initially designed called the North and
South Field and were separated by nearly 1,524 m (5,000 ft). The majority of the buildings were
placed between the two fields. The buildings were temporary and semi-permanent facilities and
based on standardized plans used at military installations throughout the nation. The
administrative offices (Building 700), the gatehouse (Building 775), runways at North Field and
South Field, and hangars and aircraft maintenance facilities (Buildings 760 and 771) were
constructed first. Support facilities including the fire station and warehouse facilities (Buildings
776 and 701 respectively) were built soon after. The main activity at the station focused on the
runways and pilot training (Stokes et al. 2009).
After World War II ended, the Navy could not maintain an expensive, full wartime complement
of Navy bases throughout south Texas. As a result, the Navy announced that it would
decommission the Kingsville base on March 31, 1946. The base was decommissioned on
August 1, 1946 and Navy personnel vacated the station by mid-September (Stokes et al. 2009).
A local governmental board accepted stewardship of the facility after it was decommissioned
leasing the facility from the U.S. Government for a nominal $1-per-year fee. Local businesses,
community groups and Texas A&I College expressed interest in the facilities and the college was
granted a lease. The station facilities served an important satellite function to the growing
college for nearly four years. By late 1950, in response to the potential of the Korean Conflict,
Navy officials recommissioned NAAS Kingsville on April 1, 1951. Texas A&I College received
word about their change of lease in December 1950 and had completely vacated the site by June
1951 (Stokes et al. 2009).
The recommissioned NAAS Kingsville would serve as a jet transitional training facility.
Rehabilitation construction work began in March 1951 and by late June, the field was fully
operational. The Korean Conflict ended with a cease-fire agreement in 1953, but much of the
building program associated with the reactivation of NAAS Kingsville during the Korean
Conflict continued. Between the end of the Korean and beginning of the Vietnam conflict, the
number of personnel at NAAS Kingsville fluctuated in response to Naval funding allocations.
Similarly building renovation and replacement at the NAAS also fluctuated with funding. On
October 31, 1956, Naval Auxiliary landing Field (NALF) Orange Grove, located 32 km (20 mi)
away from NAAS Kingsville, was commissioned, though it had been used in an unofficially
capacity by cadets for some time. As the American military became increasingly reliant on jet
aircraft during the 1950s, education for the Navyâs pilots at NAAS Kingsville kept pace with the
technological changes. In 1960, NAAS Kingsville became an all-jet training base. The land that
would become the McMullen Range Complex was purchased by the U.S. Government ca. 1965

and was established to the take place of bombing ranges on Padre Island as they were
decommissioned. In 1968, the Navy upgraded NAAS Kingsville to an autonomous NAS.
During the late 1960s, the NAS Kingsville Civil Disturbance Rifle Detachment drilled regularly
at the Station in response to official fears about popular uprisings from both civil rights
proponents and students protesting American involvement in Southeast Asia. In 1990 the Navy
acquired the Escondido Ranch, a hunting ranch located 145 km (90 mi) northwest of Kingsville.
The ranch is managed by the Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Department of NAS Kingsville
and is for use by Navy personnel and their families. Administration of the McMullen Range
Complex, formerly part of NAS Chase Field, came under NAS Kingsville in 1993 (Stokes et al.
2009).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Prior to the initiation of the pedestrian field surveys, a records search was performed by GSRC
personnel at the TARL on June 14, 2010. The records search sought to identify any previous
cultural resources surveys, cemeteries, landmarks, and historic structures, buildings, sites,
districts or objects, as well as any previously recorded archaeological sites within 1.6 km (1.0
mi) of the proposed construction locations. A total of three previously conducted archaeological
investigations were on file for the 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of the three proposed alternative locations
(Figure 4-1). The sponsoring agencies for the sites included the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) and the USACE Vicksburg and Mobile Districts. Additional
archaeological and historic resource research has been conducted at NAS Kingsville as part of
their ongoing Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan (ICRMP). No previously
recorded archaeological sites were recorded within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of any of the project areas,
but the King Ranch NRHP Historic District is within 1.6 km (1.0 mi) of Alternative Site 2.

4.1.1 NAS Kingsville ICRMP
An ICRMP was developed in May 2009 for NAS Kingsville and its outlying properties which
include four additional properties that are managed under NAS Kingsville: NALF Orange Grove,
King Ranch Over-the-Horizon Radar (ROTHR) Site, McMullen Range Complex (Yankee and
Dixie Target Ranges), and Esondido Ranch. At the time of the publication of the ICRMP a total
of 117 acres has undergone archaeological site identification on the NAS Kingsville main base,
which includes the survey of 10 acres performed for USACE-Mobile identified in Table 4-1
above. This has resulted in the identification of four archaeological sites on the NAS Kingsville
main base. None of the sites recorded were recommended eligible for listing on the NRHP. The
archaeological work conducted at NAS Kingsville as well as in other locations in Kleberg
County suggest that archaeological sites are predominantly located near water sources and
consist of relatively few artifacts that are often on or just below the surface (Stokes et al. 2009).
Historic architecture surveys conducted at the NAS Kingsville main base have identified eight
historic buildings (Buildings 700, 701, 775, 776, 760, 760A, 760B, and 771) and one historic

Buildings 700, 701, 775, and 776 had since been demolished in consultation with the Texas
SHPO, leaving five extant NRHP-eligible historic architectural resources at NAS Kingsville
(Building 700 esplanade and Buildings 760, 760A, 760B, and 771). None of the buildings are
located within the 0.8 km (0.5 mi) visual APE for any of the alternative site locations.
Additional surveys are needed at NAS Kingsville to identify other architectural resources that
may be eligible for listing on the NRHP.
4.2

THE KING RANCH HISTORIC DISTRICT

The boundaries of the King Ranch Historic District were drawn to include the major core of the
King Ranch, Inc. at the time that the historic district was recorded. Although the land area of the
ranch had been in almost constant flux from the time that Richard King purchased the first parcel
of land, the basic distribution of the northern and southern sectors has remained constant. The
historic district boundary includes the Santa Gertrudis, Laureles and Norias Divisions, which
embodies the ranch in its first period under Richard King. The periods of significance extend
from 1850 to 1924 and the areas of significance included exploration and settlement as well
agriculture (ranching).
Richard King first arrived in Texas in 1847, as a riverboat pilot, with long-time friend Mifflin
Kenedy. King piloted steamboats during the war and after, started his own steamboat line. In
1850, he joined Kenedy and two other investors to form the M. Kenedy and Company of
Brownsville. The company, utilizing steamboats designed by King for the Rio Grande, soon had
a monopoly of commercial traffic on the river. King would continue to work in the riverboat
business until 1874.
In 1850, in association with an old friend, Legs Lewis, King started investing in land. Kingâs
knowledge of some of the old Rio Grande families was invaluable in obtaining land titles that
had clear chains of title. King and Lewis set up camp near the springs that fed Santa Gertrudis
Creek. Lewis formed the Texas Mounted Volunteers to provide protection in the area from
Indians, hide-peeler (people that stole and skinned cattle often while the animal was still alive),
mustangers, and other marauders, while King, through the use of his riverboat company,
provided the capital needed for the land investments. Initial land purchases made by King
centered around Santa Gertrudis Creek. Two tracts of land were purchased concurrently. Ricon
de Santa Gertrudis, comprising approximately 6,273 ha (15,500 ac) was initially purchased
followed by Santa Gertrudis de la Garza, comprising approximately 21,853 ha (54,000 ac).
On these initial plots of land, King began his cattle operation, buying cattle from Mexico and
hiring Mexican cowboys or vaqueros to herd them. He eventually moved a whole village from
the hills of Tamaulipas to his ranch setting up the community as his employees. King purchased
additional parcels of land including the Puerto de Agua Dulce as well as parcels on Padre Island.
In 1860, King founded the R. King and Company which joined all the land titles of James
Woolworth, King, and his wife Henrietta. In 1862, King bought 36,421 ha (90,000 ac) named
the Lareles tract and another 8,903 ha (22,000 ac) from William Mann in the Ryas Blanca grant,
north of Santa Gertrudis. Ranch headquarters had also become the official receiving, storage and

shipping point for cotton on the Matamoros market. During the Civil War, King contracted to
furnish beef for the Confederates.
In 1868, Kenedy began his own independent ranching operation taking 26 leagues of the
Laureles grant. In return for Kingâs Brownsville town property and three tracts of unrelated
pasture, Kenedy traded all of his interest in Santa Gertrudis as well as the Corpus Christi
property. Following the war, raids from Mexican bandits started to rise and, until 1875,
continued persistently and unchecked. By the end of these raids, King had suffered losses
totaling $1 million dollars. Despite the losses, King continued to buy land and acquired a large
section of the San Carricitos grant in south Texas.
Richard King passed away on April 14, 1884 leaving his heirs land valued at $564,784 dollars
and livestock worth $496,700 dollars. After his death, his son-in-law continued land acquisition
as well as methodical breeding of cattle. Even though difficult financial times during the 1880s
necessitated the selling of approximately 4,450 ha (10,995 ac) of land, efforts continued to
consolidate and obtain land grants for the ranch. In 1901, they bought 24,281 ha (60,000 ac) in
the grants Las Comitos, El Infernillo, and most of El Chiltipin. In 1906, Ricon de los Laureles
was purchased from the Texas Land and Cattle Company totaling 44,515 ha (110,000 ac).
During the first decade of the new century, Mrs. Henrietta King gave half interest in 30,351 ha
(75,000 ac) and right-of-way across her property to form the St. Louis, Brownsville, Mexico
Railroad. This was divided in 16,924 ha (41,820 ac) along the railroad, including Kingsvilleâs
345 ha (853 ac), as well as, 14, 105 ha (34,855 ac) around Raymondville for town development.
In 1907, Theodore Koch bought 9,664 ha (23,880 ac) of Rincon de la Boveda to develop the
town of Rivera. When Kleberg County was formed in 1913, the King property comprised
approximately 80 percent of the county. At the death of Henrietta King in 1924, the estate
owned 403,652 ha (997,445 ac), not including the 12,318 ha (30,439 ac) of Santa Gertrudis
headwaters, as well as the Stillman and Lasater tracts, which Henrietta had previously given to
her daughter Alice and son-in-law Robert Kleberg.
King Ranch ranks as one of the most outstanding and best known of all cattle enterprises in the
history of the southwestern cattle frontier. The only new breed of cattle to be developed in the
U.S., the Santa Gertrudis breed, was produced on King Ranch. In addition, studies of grassland
and animal diseases conducted at King Ranch contributed greatly to the cattle industry.
The portion of the King Ranch NRHP historic district that lies within the 0.8 km (0.5 mi) visual
APE of Alternative Site 2 consists of undeveloped ranch or pasture land. No above ground
resources associated with the historic district are within the 0.8 km (0.5 mi) visual APE of
Alternative Site 2.

SURVEY METHODS

The survey was conducted according to the standards and guidelines recommended by the THC.
Previously conducted research in the region show that archaeological sites are typically located
near water sources and are often on or just below the surface having shallow deposits (Stokes et
al. 2009). Given the geology of the area, the location of the alternative site locations away from
water sources and the disturbance from historic farming on all of the proposed sites, there is little
or no potential for intact subsurface deposits. Given the good surface visibility and the lack of
potential for subsurface deposits, a pedestrian survey of the project area was conducted. The
pedestrian surveys were conducted using parallel transects spaced no greater than 30 m (100 ft)
apart. During the pedestrian surveys the ground surface was inspected for any artifacts, features,
or other cultural material. Concentrations of artifacts and features representing a loci of human
activity were recorded as archaeological sites. Isolated artifacts which did not represent a loci of
human activity were recorded as isolated occurrences. All isolated artifact locations and
boundaries of archaeological sites were recorded with a Trimble Recon â¢ Global Positioning
System (GPS) unit. Diagnostic artifacts located within archaeological sites were also recoded
using a GPS unit. Since surface visibility was greater than 30 percent all site boundaries were
defined from the surface distribution of artifacts.

SURVEY RESULTS

Surveys of the three alternative sites (Alternative Sites 1, 2, and 3) were accomplished during a
single field session from June 19 to June 21, 2010. Mr. Lindemuth, Mr. Ellzey and Mr. Nicholas
Bourgeois conducted the pedestrian survey on all three alternative sites. The cultural resources
surveys identified three archaeological sites (41KL97, 41KL98, and 41KL99) at Alternative
Site 3. Nine isolated occurrences (IO) were recorded at Alternative Sites 1 and 3 (Figure 6-1).
No cultural resources were recorded at Alternative Site 2. The results of field surveys for each of
the alternative sites are summarized below.
6.1

ALTERNATIVE SITE 1

6.1.1 Archaeological Resources
An intensive pedestrian survey was conducted across the entire Alternative Site 1 utilizing
transects spaced 30 m (100 ft) apart. The site was in cultivation for cotton and sorghum. Overall
surface visibility was excellent with an average of 40 to 100 percent visibility across the entire
project area. One scatter of modern material, construction tile (400+), concrete (15), plastic (45),
brick (2), clear bottle glass (1), cinder block fragments (42), window glass (18), mortar (3), and
other debris was located in the northeast corner of Site 1. Historic aerials and photographs show
this area as undeveloped until 1995 when aerial photograph depicts a building in the vicinity
(Figure 6-2). Given the modern nature of the material and its association with a building that
was constructed between 1979 and 1995, the material is not considered an archaeological site. In
addition, six IOs were recorded during the survey of the alternative site location (Figure 6-1).
Table 6-1 summarizes the IOs recorded within Alternative Site 1. IOs are not considered eligible
for listing on the NRHP. No additional archaeological work is recommended for Alternative
Site 1.

ALTERNATIVE SITE 2

6.2.1 Archaeological Resources
An intensive pedestrian survey was conducted across the entire Alternative Site 2 utilizing
transects spaced 30 m (100 ft) apart. This site was in cultivation for sorghum. The site had good
to excellent ground visibility (60 to 100 percent) across the parcel. No artifacts that were 50
years old or older were recorded during the survey of the site. No additional archaeological
work is recommended for Alternative Site 2.
6.2.2 Architectural Resources
No above ground resources that are 50 years old or older were identified within the APE of
Alternative Site 2. Adjacent to Alternative Site 2 are buildings and structures that are 50 years
old or older (Photograph 6-1). If this site is chosen the buildings and structures would need to
undergo a Section 106 evaluation for their eligibility for the NRHP. If the buildings are
determined eligible for the NRHP, an effects determination would be needed to determine
potential visual effects on these buildings and structures.

6.2.3 King Ranch NRHP Historic District
One historic district, the King Ranch NRHP Historic District is located within the 0.8 km
(0.5 mi) visual APE of Alternative Site 2. The portion of the King Ranch NRHP Historic
District within the 0.8 km (0.5 mi) visual APE of the Alternative Site 2 consists of undeveloped
pasture/range land, with no above ground resources associated with the King Ranch NRHP
Historic District present.

6.2.4 Effects Determination
No historic properties were recorded within the boundary of Alternative Site 2. The King Ranch
NRHP Historic District and structures and buildings that are 50 years old or older are located
adjacent but outside of Alternative Site 2. If Alternative Site 2 is chosen, then a formal NRHP
eligibility determination would need to be made for the buildings and structures adjacent to
Alternative Site 2. If the buildings are determined eligible for the NRHP an effects
determination would need to be made for possible visual effects to the buildings and structures as
well as the King Ranch NRHP Historic district.

ALTERNATIVE SITE 3

6.3.1 Archaeological Resources
An intensive pedestrian survey was conducted across the entire site utilizing transects spaced 30
m (100 ft) apart. The alternative site was in cultivation for cotton. Overall surface visibility was
excellent with an average of 40 to 100 percent visibility across the entire project area. Three
archaeological sites (41KL97, 41KL98, and 41KL99) consisting of surface scatters of historic
artifacts and three IOs were recorded during the survey of the parcel (see figure 6-1).
6.3.1.1 41KL97 (Locus 3-1)
41KL97 (Locus 3-1) was recorded from a surface scatter of historic artifacts recorded adjacent to
the edge of Alternative Site 3 (Figure 6-3). Given the siteâs proximity to Alternative Site 3, it
was recorded even though it lies outside of the survey area. The boundary of 41KL97 was
defined by the surface scatter of artifacts. The site measures approximately 189 m (620 ft) northsouth by 132 m (433 ft) east-west. The total site area for 41KL97 is approximately 16,187
square meters ( m2) (174,240 square feet [ft2]). The site is positioned on a slight rise in the
middle of an active cotton field (Photograph 6-2). Historic aerial photography shows the area
encompassing the site has been under active cultivation since at least 1968.

A total of 1,554 artifacts was recorded in the field during the delineation of 41KL97 (Table 6-2).
Artifacts recorded at 41KL97 consist predominantly of glass, followed by architectural materials,
ceramics, metal and other miscellaneous artifacts. Glass artifacts consisted of shards of various
colors including clear, aquamarine, solarized manganese, light blue, amber, green, light green,
translucent mint green, milk, cobalt blue, ball blue, and rose. Solarized manganese glass was
produced from approximately 1875 to 1920 (Photograph 6-3) (Lockhart 2006). The majority of
glass whose manufacture could be determined was machine-made, which was produced from
approximately 1903 to present (Bureau of Land Management [BLM] 2007). Some bottle
fragments were indicative of patent medicine bottles (Photograph 6-4).

Architectural material recorded consisted predominantly of possible construction stone (i.e., cut
limestone). Also recorded were brick, concrete, and mortar. Ceramic artifacts were dominated
by whiteware and also included porcelain, ironstone, stoneware, earthenware, and terracotta.
Whiteware has been produced since approximately 1820. Decorative techniques noted on
whiteware sherds included molded specimens, blue and black transfer printed sherds,
polychrome decal decorated sherds, annular decorated sherds, shell edge sherds, and hand
painted sherds. Annular decorated sherds were common from approximately 1820 to 1890
(South 1977). Transfer printed decoration on whiteware, though still produced today, was
common from approximately 1820 to 1850 (Photographs 6-5 and 6-6). Decal decorated
whiteware was common after approximately 1890. Shell edge decoration was popular from
approximately 1865 to 1895 (Photograph 6-7). One of the whiteware sherds exhibited a makerâs
mark which could not be identified (Photograph 6-8). Decorative techniques for porcelain
included molded and decal decorated pieces. Ironstone was produced commonly from
approximately 1842 to 1930. Decorative techniques noted on ironstone sherds included decal
decorated sherds and a single sherd with a makerâs mark that could not be identified (Photograph
6-9). Stoneware has been produced since 1880 (Miller et al. 2000). Albany slip decorated
stoneware was commonly produced from approximately 1875 to 1940 (Greer 2005) (Photograph
6-10). Bristol glazed stoneware has been produced since approximately 1900 (Greer 2005)
(Photograph 6-11). Salt glazed stoneware was common from approximately 1705 to 1930
(Miller et al. 2000). Other ceramics recorded included unrefined glazed earthenwares and
terracotta. Architectural ceramics included a porcelain door knob (Photograph 6-12) as well as a
porcelain insulator (Photograph 6-13). A single prosser porcelain button was also recorded at the
site. Prosser buttons were patented in 1840 and were in common use from approximately 1850
to the early twentieth century.

Metal artifacts recorded at 41KL97 were limited, probably due to poor preservation. Artifacts
recovered included square and wire nails, various metal hardware, an iron clothes iron, and
unidentifiable metal fragments. Cut nails were common from approximately 1790 to 1890 and
wire nails were common after 1885 (Miller et al. 2000; Adams 2002). The metal clothes iron
was cast and had the number â7â cast into its top (Photograph 6-14).

Other artifacts recovered from 41KL97 included 2- and 4-hole shell buttons, a bakelite fragment,
plastic, two graphite battery cores, and vinyl record fragment. Shell buttons have been in
production since 1855 (see Photograph 6-6; Photographs 6-15 to 6-16).

The artifact assemblage from 41KL97 suggests that the site represents late nineteenth century to
early twentieth century farmstead. The 1908 Sarita, Texas 30 minute series topographic
quadrangle shows the area in the vicinity of the site as undeveloped (Figure 6-4). It may be
possible that the structure was built after the area was surveyed for the map and may suggest that
the site represents an early twentieth century farmstead instead of a late nineteenth century
farmstead. The 1954 Riviera, Texas 15 minute series topographic quadrangle also shows the
area as undeveloped which suggests the structure was destroyed by 1954 (Figure 6-5). No
structures were present in the vicinity of the site in aerial photography dating from 1968, 1979,
1995, 2004, 2005, or 2006 (Figures 6-6 to 6-11). Also no structure was present in the 1979
Ricardo, Texas 7.5 minute series topographic quadrangle (Figure 6-12).
No intact features were recorded during the delineation of 41KL97. The site has been heavily
impacted by historic farming. The area encompassing the site has been in active agricultural
production since 1968 as shown in the aerial photographs and possibly earlier. There is little or
no potential for intact subsurface deposits given the heavy agricultural production of the site and
the nature of the soils. Given the lack of integrity at 41KL97, it is considered to have a low
research potential and is not recommended eligible for listing in the NRHP. No further
archaeological work is recommended for 41KL97.
6.3.1.2 41KL98 (Locus 3-2)
41KL98 (Locus 3-2) was recorded from a surface scatter of artifacts in the northwest corner of
the Alternative Site 3 (see figure 6-1). The site is located within a cultivated field of cotton
(Photograph 6-17) and its boundaries were determined from the surface scatter of artifacts. The
boundaries of the site probably extend further to the west outside of the current survey area.
41KL98 measures approximately 117 m (384 ft) north-south by 160 m (525 ft) east-west and has
a total area of 14,164 m2 (152,460 ft2) (Figure 6-13).

A total of 1,121 artifacts was recorded during the delineation of 41KL98 (Table 6-3). Artifacts
recorded at 41KL98 were predominantly glass. Other artifact types included historic ceramics,
architectural material, metal, and other artifacts such as modern synthetic material, a graphite
battery core, and a sparkplug. Glass artifacts were recorded in a number of different colors
including clear, amber, cobalt blue, light blue, milk, translucent mint green, green, light green,
dark olive green, aquamarine, solarized manganese, rose and yellow-green. Both curved or
bottle glass was recorded as well as flat or window glass. Solarized manganese glass was
produced from approximately 1875 to 1920 (Photograph 6-18) (Miller et al. 2000). Decorative
techniques for glass included both molded and embossed decorations. Several of the bases of
glass artifacts contained makerâs marks. One amber bottle base fragment was embossed with âB
in a circle/1696/0â which belongs to the Brockway Glass Company and has been in use since
1925 (Toulouse 2001). Another embossed makerâs mark on an amber glass bottle base consisted
of the letter âGâ in a circle which was used by the Gulfport Glass company from 1955 until they
ceased operation in 1970 (Photograph 6-19) (Toulouse 2001). The majority of the glass artifacts
whose manufacture could be determined were machine-made which were in production from
1903 to present. One light green glass fragment has a tooled double ring finish (Photograph
6-20).

Historic ceramics recorded at 41KL98 consisted predominantly of whiteware, with the remainder
being divided among porcelain, stoneware, ironstone, yellowware, porcelaneous stoneware, and
other unrefined earthenwares. Whiteware has been in production since approximately 1820.
Decorative techniques noted on the whiteware sherds recorded included molded, blue-transfer
print, hand painted, flow blue, and polychrome decal decorations. Transfer print decorations
were common from approximately 1820 to 1850 (Miller et al. 2000) (Photograph 6-22). Flow
blue floral decoration has been in production since approximately 1845 (Miller et al. 2000);
(Photograph 6-23). Polychrome decal decorated whiteware sherds were common since
approximately 1890 (Miller et al. 2000); (Photograph 6-24). One whiteware sherd had a partial
makerâs mark that could not be identified (see Photograph 6-22). Porcelain artifacts included
plain, molded, hand painted, and polychrome decal varieties. Stoneware has been in production
since approximately 1880 (Miller et al. 2000). Decorative techniques associated with the
stoneware recorded at 41KL98 include Albany slip and Bristol Glaze decorations. Albany slip
decorated stonewares were common from approximately 1875 to 1940 (Greer 2005). Bristol
glaze decorated stonewares have been in production since approximately 1900 (Greer 2005)
(Photograph 6-25). One stoneware sherd had an Albany slip decoration on the interior and a
Bristol glaze decoration on the exterior which was common from approximately 1900 to 1915
(Greer 2005). Ironstone was common from approximately 1842 to 1930. One sherd of ironstone
has a partial makerâs mark which could not be identified (Photograph 6-26). Yellowware was
commonly produced between 1830 and 1940. One sherd of yellowware had a handpainted
decoration (Photograph 6-27). Other ceramic artifacts recovered were predominantly utilitarian
porcelaneous stoneware insulators and some unrefined glazed earthenware sherds.

Architectural material was dominated by limestone fragments some with evidence of being cut
for construction stone. Other artifacts recorded were brick, mortar, and fiberboard tile. Metal
artifacts were limited and included cut and wire nails, bailing wire, various metal hardware such
as bolts and nuts, a lead bullet, and unidentifiable metal fragments. Cut nails have been
produced since 1790 but were common between 1790 and 1890. Wire nails have been produced
since 1860 but were common after 1885 (Adams 2002; Miller et al. 2000).
The area around 41KL98 is shown as undeveloped on the 1908 Sarita, Texas 30 minute
topographic quadrangle (see figure 6-4). By the 1954 Riviera, Texas 15 minute series
topographic quadrangle there is a single structure shown within the site boundary (see
figure 6-5). The structure is absent from aerial photography dating to 1968, and in all subsequent
aerial photography examined from 1979, 1995, 2004, 2005, and 2006 (see figures 6-6 to 6-11).
The area in the vicinity of 41KL98 is shown to be in active cultivation since 1968. The structure
is also absent from the 1979 East Ricardo 7.5 minute series topographic quadrangle (see figure
6-12). Given the artifact inventory and archival research, the site probably represents a structure
belonging to a middle nineteenth to early twentieth century farmstead, likely associated with the
buildings immediately to the west of the site. Local informants stated that there was a structure
there at one time that housed farm workers and, as such, probably represents a tenant farm
structure.
No intact features were recorded during the delineation of 41KL98. Site 41KL98 has been
heavily impacted by past agricultural activity and is considered to have a low integrity. Given
the past agricultural activity, as well as the nature of soils, there is little or no potential for intact
cultural deposits at the site. With that, 41KL98 is considered to have poor research potential and
is not recommended eligible for the NRHP. No further archaeological work is recommended for
41KL98.

6.3.1.3 41KL99 (Locus 3-3)
Site 41KL99 (Locus 3-3) was recorded from a surface scatter of historic artifacts found along the
northern boundary of Alternative Site 3 (see figure 6-1). The site was delineated by the surface
scatter of artifacts. Site 41KL99 measures approximately 25 m (82 ft) north-south by 90 m (295
ft) east west and has an area of approximately 1,497 m2 (16,117 ft2) (Figure 6-14). The site is
located adjacent to and south of an irrigation canal within a cotton field (Photograph 6-28).

Photograph 6-28. Site overview of 41KL99, facing west.

A total of 297 artifacts was recorded at 41KL99 (Table 6-4). The vast majority (86 percent) of
the artifacts was glass. Other artifact types recorded included historic ceramics, and small
numbers of architectural, metal and other artifacts. Glass colors recorded included clear, amber,
cobalt blue, milk, green, yellow-green and aquamarine. The majority of the glass recorded was
curved or bottle glass with a small portion being flat or window glass. All glass shards whose
manufacture could be identified were machine-made. Machine-made glass has been in
production since approximately 1903. Two of the bottle bases had identifiable makerâs mark.
One clear bottle base had a double reversed âFâ mark with a number â4â and â1.â
Toulouse (2001) identifies the reversed double âFâ mark as belonging to the Foster-Forbes Glass
Company of Marion, Indiana. Toulouse (2001) indicates that the mark has been in use since
1929 and possibly later. Another clear bottle base had a cursive âLâ in a circle with a â3â and
â0â on its left and right respectively (Photograph 6-29). This makerâs mark is attributable to the
Libbey Glass Company of Toledo, Ohio. The cursive âLâ within a solid circle dates since 1955.
The cursive L with a broken circle can date as early as 1937 and with a double circle as early as
1924 (Toulouse 2001). The makerâs mark recorded does not exactly match either of these marks
but probably dates after the first appearance of the cursive âLâ in 1924.

Ceramic artifacts were predominantly relatively thick porcelaneous stoneware often called hotel
ware. This type of ceramic was typically used in commercial settings. Decorative techniques for
the porcelaneous stoneware recorded was limited to green annular decorations (see Photograph
6-29; Photograph 6-30). The remaining historic ceramics consisted of plain whiteware and
porcelain. Whiteware has been produced since 1820 (Miller et al. 2000).

Other artifacts recorded at 41KL99 included architectural material consisting of cut limestone
fragments and brick, unidentifiable ferrous metal fragments, and a burned bone fragment. Given
the limited amount of material, particularly architectural material, it is unlikely that this site
represents the remains of a structure. No structures are shown within the vicinity of 41KL99 on
the 1908 Sarita, Texas 30 minute series topographic quadrangle, the 1954 Rivera, Texas 15
minute series topographic quadrangle, or the 1979 Ricardo, Texas 7.5 minute series topographic
quadrangles (see figures 6-4, 6-5, and 6-12). Similarly, no structures are shown in the vicinity of
the site in aerial photography dating from 1968, 1979, 1995, 2004, 2005, or 2006 (see figures 6-6
to 6-11). Given the artifact assemblage the site probably represents a middle to late twentieth
century trash pile. Local informants also stated that the military set up a temporary camp in the
field when initially opening the NAAS, though they could not remember exactly where the camp
was located.
Site 41KL99 has been heavily impacted from historic agricultural activity. Like 41KL97 and
41KL98, the area comprising the site has been steadily farmed since at least 1968. Given the
nature of the soils and the disturbance from plowing in the past, there is little or no potential for
intact cultural deposits. No intact features were recorded during the delineation of the site.
Given the low integrity of 41KL99, it is considered to have a low research potential and is not
recommended eligible for listing on the NRHP. No further archaeological work is recommended
for 41KL99.
6.3.2 Isolated Occurrences
Three IOs were recorded during the survey of Site 3. Table 6-5 summarizes the IOs recorded
during the survey. IOs, by their nature, are not considered archaeological sites, and therefore, are
not recommended eligible for listing on the NRHP.

6.3.3 Architectural Resources
No above ground resources were recorded during the survey within the boundaries of Alternative
Site 3. Several buildings which are 50 years old or older are located adjacent to but outside of
Alternative Site 3 (Photographs 6-31 to 6-36). If Alternative Site 3 is chosen, a formal NRHP
eligibility determination would be needed for these resources and an effects determination for
possible visual impacts would need to be made if the buildings are determined eligible for the
NRHP.

6.3.4 Effects Determination
No historic properties were recorded within the boundaries of Alternative Site 3. No direct
effects to historic properties are anticipated from the development of Alternative Site 3. Several
buildings that are 50 years old and older are located adjacent to the Alternative Site 3. If
Alternative Site 3 is chosen, then a formal NRHP eligibility determination would need to be
made for the buildings adjacent to Alternative Site 3. If the buildings are determined eligible for
the NRHP, an effects determination would need to be made for possible visual effects to the
buildings.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Three archaeological sites (41KL97, 41KL98, and 41KL99) were recorded during the cultural
resources survey of Alternative Sites 1, 2, and 3. All three archaeological sites were recorded
within Alternative Site 3. Site 41KL97 represents a late nineteenth to early twentieth century
farmstead. Site 41KL98 represents the remains of probable mid-nineteenth to early twentieth
century farm worker building. Finally, site 41KL99 probably represents a middle to late
twentieth century trash pile or temporary military camp. All of the sites recorded have a low
integrity resulting from disturbance from years of agricultural production. Given the low
integrity of the sites recorded, none of the sites are recommended eligible for listing on the
NRHP. No further work is recommended for any of the archaeological sites recorded.
No above ground resources were recorded within the boundaries of Alternative Sites 1, 2, or 3.
Structures and buildings that are 50 years old or older are located adjacent to Alternative Sites 2
and 3. If Alternative Site 2 or 3 is chosen for the proposed USBP Station, then a formal
evaluation of those structures would be needed to determine if they are eligible for the NRHP. If
they are determined eligible, then an effect determination would be needed to address potential
visual effects to those structures. In addition, the King Ranch NRHP Historic District, is located
within the 0.8 km (0.5 mi) visual APE of Alternative Site 2. The portion of the historic district
within the visual APE consists of undeveloped pasture/range land. No above ground resources
associated with the King Ranch historic district are located within the visual APE.
Alternative Site 1 is considered to be preferred site location for the proposed station. No historic
properties are located within or adjacent to Alternative Site 1. As a result, no historic properties
would be affected from development of Alternative Site 1. Additional evaluation of structures
and buildings that are 50 years old or older would be needed if Alternative Site 2 or 3 are
selected.
If previously unidentified cultural resources are encountered during construction of the USBP
Station, the contractor should stop all ground disturbing activities in the vicinity of the discovery
until an archaeologist is notified and the nature and significance of the find can be evaluated per
Section 106 of 36 Code of Federal Regulations Part 800, under the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. If human remains are encountered during construction
activity, the THC must be notified and appropriate tribal organizations must be consulted per the
Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990.
