Abstract
In March of 2014, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) carried out an intensive
archeological investigation for the Farm-to-Market (FM) 664 improvement project in Ellis
County, Texas (CSJ# 1051-01-037). The proposed project extends from Westmoreland
Road in Ovilla to Interstate Highway 35E in Red Oak and entails the widening of the
existing roadway, the expansion of an existing bridge, as well as the acquisition of
proposed easements. The total project length is approximately 3.13 miles or about
58.5 acres, of which 20.7 acres are proposed new right-of-way and easements.
AmaTerra conducted the archeological survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6812.
Archeological investigations involved a pedestrian survey and the excavation of 71 shovel
tests and two backhoe trenches throughout the Area of Potential Effect (APE) where
right-of-entry to private properties was available. One archeological site, 41EL263, was
identified and recorded during field investigations. Located in a fallow field north of FM
664, the historic-period farmstead consists of two brick-lined cisterns, one well-like
depression, a box construction style dwelling, two pier footings, and shallowly buried
domestic debris (e.g., clear window glass shards, a whiteware fragment ,and miscellaneous
metal hardware). AmaTerra recommends that Site 41EL263 is not eligible for listing as
a State Antiquities Landmark or in the National Register of Historic Places. In addition,
archeologists identified and recorded one archeological locality of interest (Locality
A) consisting of a modified Superior short bus, a Borden’s Milk and Ice Cream trailer,
segments of a barbed wire fence, and miscellaneous debris of recent origins. Based on
the results of field investigations, no additional archeological investigations within the
proposed APE are warranted at this time. No artifacts were collected during this survey.

Chapter 1

Introduction and Management Summary
In March 2014, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted an archeological
survey in advance of the proposed improvements to Farm-to-Market (FM) 664 in Ellis
County, Texas (CSJ # 1051-01-037). The project extends approximately 3.13 miles from
Westmoreland Road (Rd.) in Ovilla to Interstate Highway (IH) 35E in Red Oak and will
involve the widening of the existing roadway and an existing bridge over Little Creek, as
well as the extension of both concrete box and pipe culverts to the edge of the proposed
right-of-way (ROW) (Figure 1.1).
At present, the existing FM 664 facility consists of an undivided rural highway with
dedicated shoulders and single lanes in each direction with a center left turn lane at the
intersection of Hampton Rd. Typical ROW width varies from 80–100 feet. The proposed
project will urbanize the rural highway helping to alleviate congestion and promote safety
for both drivers and pedestrians.
The proposed project would feature two 12-foot lanes, one 14-foot lane, a two-foot curb
offset, a 14.5-foot separation strip, and a five-foot sidewalk in each direction, divided by
a raised 17-foot median. Left turn lanes 12 feet wide would be located at median breaks
and would feature 275 feet for deceleration and 80–100 feet for storage. The bridge over
Little Creek would be widened to accommodate the same travel lanes as the rest of the
roadway, along with two-foot curb offsets and six-foot wide sidewalks; an additional three
bridge piers would be installed on each side of the bridge in each direction (12 piers total)
to a maximum depth of 30 feet. Four reinforced concrete box culverts and four reinforced
concrete pipe culverts would be extended to the edge of the proposed ROW. Expansion
would require approximately 50 feet of new ROW, which would be taken from one or both
sides of the roadway. The proposed improvements would expand the typical ROW to 150
feet over most of the project’s length, which would require a total of approximately 19.6
acres of new ROW. Additionally, 11 new drainage easements would be required totaling
1.1 acres in area.
The Area of Potential Effects (APE) for archeological resources is defined as the footprint
of the proposed facility to the maximum depth of impact, including all easements and
project specific locations. Thus, the APE for archeological resources would cover a total
distance of 3.13 miles and about 58.5 acres, of which 20.7 are proposed new ROW and
easements. The project would be built at grade and therefore, the maximum depth of
impact would be three feet or less, except at the proposed bridge and box culverts and
where storm drains are proposed. At those locations, impacts would extend well below the
depth of Holocene deposits.

The project is being funded by TxDOT using federal transportation funds. Since the project
is being built with federal transportation money on land owned or controlled by the State of
Texas, the project falls under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Section
106) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Therefore, AmaTerra’s work conformed
to the guidelines under 36 CFR 800 and 13 TAC 26, which outline the regulations for
implementing Section 106 and the ACT.
Coordination with TxDOT resulted in a survey recommendation for the APE. The proposed
project would be built on public and private property, of which AmaTerra had access to
approximately 70 percent of at the time of survey. Private properties not accessible due
to a lack of right-of-entry (ROE) were visually inspected from existing ROW and fence
lines. The survey consisted of a pedestrian survey and shovel testing of all portions of
the proposed ROW where access was available, as well as the excavation of two backhoe
trenches adjacent to Little Creek. Investigators excavated 71 shovel tests and documented
one new archeological site, 41EL263, as well as one archeological locality of interest,
Locality A, within the new proposed new ROW. Site 41EL263 is a former historic farmstead
observed north of FM 664. The site is characterized by two brick-lined cisterns, one welllike depression, a box construction style dwelling, two pier footings, and shallowly buried
domestic debris (e.g., clear window glass shards, a whiteware fragment, and miscellaneous
metal hardware). AmaTerra recommends that Site 41EL263 is not eligible for listing as a
State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). No
additional archeological work is recommended for the APE.
Field investigations were conducted on March 18–20, 2014 under Antiquities Permit
No. 6812. Rachel Feit acted as Principal Investigator, Julian A. Sitters served as Project
Archeologist, and Bruce A. Darnell assisted with field investigations. A total of 48-person
hours were expended in the field in support of this project. Weather conditions were
moderate, and archeologists encountered no difficulties in completing the investigations.
No artifacts were collected during the field investigations.
This report is divided into six chapters. The project background and cultural overview are
discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 4 includes the field methodology implemented
during the project and the results of field investigations are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter
6 presents the summary and recommendations.

Project Background
Environmental Setting
According to Griffith and Omernik (2014), the APE is situated within the Texas Blackland
Prairies. More specifically, the APE falls within the Northern Blackland Prairie ecoregion.
Topographically, the Blacklands are characterized by gently undulating and rolling prairies
“underlain by interbedded chalks, marls, limestones, and shales of Cretaceous age” (Griffith
and Omernik 2014:32a). Although tall grass prairies dominate the Blacklands’ vegetation,
wooded areas are also present along primary rivers and streams, in isolated patches
within particular soils, and within abrupt topographic transitions (Diggs et al. 1999). Once
a true prairie community dominated by perennial and annual grasses (Texas A&M-Forest
Service 2014), the Blackland Prairies have been altered by agricultural, residential, and
commercial land use with only one percent of the original vegetation remaining (Griffith
and Omernik 2014). The project APE has rolling terrain ranging in elevation from 593
feet above mean sea level (amsl) to 650 feet amsl. Approximately, 90 percent of the APE
exhibited good surface visibility at the time of survey.
The regional climate is characterized as mild. Annually, the APE receives 32–40 inches of
precipitation and has a mean air temperature of 67 degrees Fahrenheit (USDA-NRCS 2014).
Natural vegetation common to the Blackland Prairie environment include little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), yellow Indian grass
(Sorghastrum nutans), switch grass (Panicum virgatum), Bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa),
Shumard red oak (Quercus shumardii), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), American elm (Ulmus
Americana), bois d’arc (Maclura pomifera), pecan (Carya illinoensis), eastern cottonwood
(Populus deltoides), and sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata) to name a few (Griffith and
Omernik 2014; Texas A&M-Forest Service 2014; Gould 1978; and Stahl and McElvaney
2003).
By the early 1900s, most of this natural vegetation had been cleared for cropland. Today,
the area remains heavily farmed with most land devoted to cotton, hay, turf grass, wheat,
and sorghum production (Haaser 2014). The closest natural source of water is Little
Creek, a tributary of Red Oak Creek, bisecting the APE approximately 2,900 feet east of
Westmoreland Rd. In addition, the APE crosses four small seasonally wet tributaries of
Little Creek.
As mentioned above, the underlying geology is characterized by Cretaceous age chalks,
marls, limestones, and shales. Specifically, the APE is underlain by Austin Chalk (Kau). The
soils within this region are described as “fine-textured, dark, calcareous, and productive
Vertisols” (Griffith and Omernik 2014: 32a). According to the United States Department of
Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) Web Soil Survey (2014),
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

soils within the APE are dominated by Austin silty clay (AuB) with one to three percent slopes
(Figure 2.1). These soils are described as residuum weathered from chalk with restrictive
features 42+ inches below the surface. Additional, but less prevalent soils within the APE
include Austin silty clay (AuC2) with three to five percent slopes, Houston black clay (HaB)
with one to three percent slopes, Broken alluvial land (Br), Eddy soils (EdD2), Whitewright
and Austin Soils (BkC2), and Stephen-Eddy Complex (SeC2). Currently, the APE is a mix
of cultivated fields intermixed with suburban and commercial development. As a result of
land use practices, the APE has been subjected to numerous disturbances including, but
not limited to, roadside drainage trenching, land leveling, terracing, and plowing.

Regional Chronology and Cultural Background
The project area is situated within the North Central Texas archeological region (Perttula
2004). Typically, cultural chronology is divided into four major periods of time: Paleoindian
(11000–8500 years before the present (BP)), Archaic (8500–1250 BP), Late Prehistoric
(approximately 1250–250 BP), and Historic (350 BP–present) (Prewitt 1981). The
Prehistoric periods are principally defined by the presence of diagnostic projectile points
and other technologies, but are intended to delineate change in socio-cultural patterns.
However, cultural change proceeded at somewhat different rates over the vast area of
Texas; in some regions, hunting and gathering cultures persisted throughout prehistory;
in others, cultures with farming and settled village life dominated. Prehistoric cultures
in North Central Texas appeared to maintain a hunter-gatherer lifestyle throughout the
Archaic and into the Late Prehistoric Period, with moderate changes in technology.

Paleoindian
The earliest known time of human occupation in North America is the Paleoindian Period.
In north Texas, it is generally considered to date from approximately 11,000–8500 BP. The
archeological evidence suggests that during this time the earliest residents of northern
Texas were highly nomadic hunters and gatherers (Brown and Lebo 1991). Populations
were likely small and dispersed, exploiting a variety of wild food resources. Inhabitants of
the region relied on a generalized hunting and gathering subsistence economy utilizing
a highly technical lithic technology. Large leaf-shaped projectile points, such as the
widespread Clovis and Folsom, are diagnostic of this time period and suggest that megafauna such as extinct bison were key resources.
Archeological sites dating to this period are often found deeply buried near water sources.
A small number of archeological sites dating to the Paleoindian Period are known to exist
in North Central Texas.

Archaic
Much of Texas prehistory is subsumed within the Archaic Period, a long time span
dominated by hunting and gathering societies. The Archaic Period has been dated in north
Texas as occurring between 8500 BP and 1250 BP. The Archaic Period is subdivided into
the Early Archaic (8500–6000 BP), the Middle Archaic (6000–3500 BP), and the Late
Archaic (3500–1250 BP). Each of these subdivisions has characteristic types of artifacts,
especially projectile points, which suggest differences in economy and possibly regional
affiliations. The period is also notable for the introduction of grinding implements and
ground-stone ornaments.

Climatic patterns fluctuated during the Archaic Period and were generally warmer than
the Paleoindian Period. At the beginning of the Archaic Period, the global climate began to
change slowly, becoming gradually warmer and dryer (Brown and Lebo 1991). In response,
plant and animal populations changed (e.g., size, range, etc.) and the human populations
in north Texas adapted by increasing their diet breadth. Large game was no longer the
primary focus of subsistence. Changes in technology included a more diverse suite of
lithic tools, increased use of grinding stones and the development of basketry. Pottery is
absent. This shift in technology indicates a gradually increasing population that utilized
abundant plant and animal resources of environments similar to those of modern times.

Late Prehistoric
During the Late Prehistoric Period (1250–250 BP), major changes in technology were
adopted by the people living in North Central Texas. The development of ceramics and the
introduction of the bow and arrow altered the economic strategies and social structures
of these Prehistoric populations. Also during this time, cultigens such as maize appeared
in the diet (Brown and Lebo 1991). Settlement patterns also changed, shifting to larger
villages that included houses (Ferring 1997). Evidence suggests that around 1060 BP, the
climate in north Texas became somewhat drier. Bison are largely absent from archeological
sites during the first half of the Late Prehistoric Period; however, they eventually spread out
over the plains of north Texas and became a vital subsistence resource (Brown and Lebo
1991).

Historic
The Spanish were the first Europeans to enter North Central Texas, but their influence
over the region was minimal. European-American settlement of the Ellis County area was
encouraged by the Republic (and later, the State) of Texas from 1840–1860. Initially,
the economy of Ellis County was supported through ranching; however, with the arrival
of the railroad during the late 1800s, a shift from cattle to agriculture occurred in Ellis
County (Haaser 2014). This shift was initiated by the construction of the Houston and
Texas Central Railroad, which made transportation faster and more affordable. During
the 1870s, land management within the region shifted from large land holdings to small
sharecropper farms. This evolution in land tenantry resulted in an influx of Anglo and
European immigrants into the region (Hardy-Heck-Moore 2014). Shortly after the railroads
construction and by the early 1900s, Ellis County was known nationally as a cotton
producer. Following the Great Depression, Ellis County declined in agricultural output. The
Brazos Electric Power Cooperative and the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) began
setting up power infrastructure in the region in 1941, resulting in near-total service (95
percent) by the early 1950s. Today, Ellis County is home to over 100,000 people with an
economy largely reliant on agriculture and manufacturing (Haaser 2014). For a detailed
historical account of Ellis County, see Ellis County Overview by Hardy-Heck-Moore Cultural
Resource Consultants (2014).

Ovilla, located near the western terminus of the project area, is the oldest community
in Ellis County—first settled in 1844 (Stewart 2014). Red Oak, located at the eastern
end of the APE, grew out of Ovilla as another farming community. The railroads bypassed
both communities in the 1880s, and Red Oak eventually moved eastward to be closer
to transportation lines. The communities and their economies have remained focused
on agriculture into the twenty-first century (Brown 2014). Today, the project APE remains
dedicated to cultivation with most of the land devoted to agriculture.

Cultural Resources in Proximity to the Project Area
Background research for this project consisted of an online records search through
the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas; 2014) and a review
of historic period maps. Research focused on the identification of archeological sites,
Registered Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed on the NRHP, sites listed as
SALs, or cemeteries within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE (Figure 3.1). The search
revealed that there are no archeological sites, RTHLs, sites listed on the NRHP, sites listed
as SALs, or cemeteries within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE. However, this is likely
due to the fact that few surveys have occurred within or near the APE. In fact, only two
linear surveys have been conducted within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the APE.
Two short linear surveys have been completed within one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the
project APE. In 1993, a linear survey was conducted on behalf of TxDOT stretching east for
approximately 2.8 kilometers from the intersection of IH 35 and FM 664 to North Central
Boulevard. The second linear survey was conducted in 1988 on behalf of the Texas Water
Development Board. This survey bisects the proposed project APE approximately 160
meters west of Blue Valley Lane. The survey followed a tributary of Little Creek (north to
south) for 2.4 kilometers. No archeological materials, features, or resources were recorded
during either of these linear surveys.
Archeologists conducted archival research to establish the potential for buried historic
archeological materials through historic land use practices. This research was conducted
online through the United States Geologic Survey-EarthExplorer (USGS-EE 2014), the PerryCastañeda Library Map Collection-University of Texas at Austin (2014) and The Portal to
Texas History (2014). A review of historic period maps depicts structures adjacent to and in
some cases falling within the APE. A revised 1939 Ellis County Highway map indicates that
there were a number of farmhouses and other possible structures located on both sides of
the project APE (Figure 3.2). Although not historic in age, a 1968 aerial photograph clearly
depicts multiple structures located along FM 664, which aided archeologists during field
investigations (Figure 3.3).

Methodology
Prior to field investigations, the APE limits were overlaid on aerial-based gridded maps and
loaded onto hand-held DeLorme GPS units to aid in navigation. Examination of the APE
consisted of pedestrian surveys, shovel testing at 100-meter intervals, and the excavation
of two backhoe trenches adjacent to Little Creek. These investigations took place within
existing and the proposed ROW where access was available. Areas of disturbance were
thoroughly photographed and archeologists made notes on the conditions they encountered
during their investigations.
Shovel tests measured 30 centimeters in diameter and extended to a maximum depth
of 80 centimeters below surface (cmbs) within undisturbed portions of the landscape.
The shovel tests were excavated in 10-centimeter increments, and all soil was screened
through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. In the event that cultural material was recovered from
a shovel test, the shovel test would be delineated at 10-meter (3.28-foot) intervals until
two negative shovel tests in every cardinal direction were attained or until a project area
boundary or physical hindrance was encountered. Relevant information for all shovel tests
was recorded on a standardized form. Shovel tests were backfilled upon completion. This
archeological investigation was a non-collection survey; therefore, artifacts encountered
during the course of the work were returned to their original location.
Two backhoe trenches were excavated adjacent to Little Creek, an area considered most
likely to contain buried cultural deposits. The backhoe trenches ranged from five to nine
meters in length, 80 centimeters in width, and extended to depths ranging from 1.7–2
meters below the surface. Samples of the soils from each trench were screened through
¼-inch hardware cloth. Backhoe trench information was recorded on standardized forms.
Digital photographs were used to document the excavation of each backhoe trench and soil
profiles. A series of profile drawings were completed for each backhoe trench and a plan
map was created of the APE illustrating the location(s) of the archeological investigations.
All trenches were mapped using a DeLorme GPS unit. Backhoe trenches were backfilled
upon completion.
For the purpose of this survey, an archeological site had to contain a certain number of
cultural materials or features older than 50 years within a given area. The definition of a
site is: (1) five or more surface artifacts within a 15-meter (approximately 50-foot) radius;
or (2) a single cultural feature, such as a burned rock midden or cistern, observed on the
surface or exposed during shovel testing; or (3) a positive shovel test containing at least
five total artifacts; or (4) two positive shovel tests located within 30 meters (98 feet) of
each other. Archeologists documented one historic-period archeological site, 41EL263,
which met these criteria.

Survey Results
Archeologists found most of
the APE to be disturbed as a
result of agricultural, residential,
and commercial development.
Disturbances within and outside of
the existing ROW included plowed
and terraced fields, buried utilities,
artificially raised and/or levelled
surfaces, and roadside drainage
ditches (Figure 5.1). Archeologists
did not excavate shovel tests in these
areas. The proposed APE is situated
within a rapidly growing suburban
community south of Dallas, Texas.
Ronny McClure, a resident of the
area since 1968, remarked that
the increase in vehicular traffic
can be attributed to the numerous
schools and religious institutions
constructed along FM 664 between
IH 35E and Westmoreland Rd.
AmaTerra’s survey progressed from
east to west along the 3.18 mile
stretch of proposed road expansion.
The entire APE was inspected on foot
and through visual reconnaissance.
Shovel testing concentrated on
areas of new ROW where ROE to
private properties was available and
where there appeared to be potential
for
archeological
resources.
Investigators excavated 71 shovel
tests (Appendix A) in support of the
survey. In addition, archeologists
excavated two backhoe trenches
adjacent to Little Creek. Ultimately,
archeologists documented one new
archeological site, 41EL263.

From IH 35E to Uhl Road
From IH 35E to Uhl Rd., a length of approximately one mile, the proposed new ROW runs
through agricultural, commercial, and residential development. This stretch of roadway
consists of terraced and plowed fields; graded, artificially raised and paved surfaces;
buried utilities; and roadside drainage ditches. Shovel testing took place on all accessible
parcels along this stretch of roadway where major disturbances were not observed. Access
was available to only about 50 percent of the parcels where new ROW has been proposed.
However, most of the parcels where access was not available had been graded, filled, or
paved over reducing the need for shovel testing. No vegetation was observed within the
agricultural fields and was limited to maintained grasses within the existing ROW while
sporadic trees were present within the proposed new ROW. Archeologists excavated 33
shovel tests within this portion of the APE (Figure 5.2).
Along the southern portion of this roadway segment, six shovel tests were excavated
by archeologists. Two of the six shovel tests were excavated within the Granzin family’s
property. According to the landowner, Walter Granzin, the property—once graded and
filled—served as a parking lot for the family-owned animal feed store. This was confirmed
during shovel testing (Shovel Tests: BD01 and BD02). The remaining four shovel tests were
excavated on land owned by Wilma Keller Family Farms, LP. The western most portion of
the property bisects a small drainage. Due to runoff, the land bordering the drainage is
heavily eroded. East of the drainage, the land has been artificially raised and is used as a
dump for construction debris (see Figure 5.1C).
Archeologists excavated 27 shovel tests along the northern portion of this roadway segment.
While the eastern half consists primarily of residential and commercial development, the
western half of this roadway segment consists of both fallow and terraced agricultural
fields. Due to access restrictions, archeologists concentrated all of their shovel tests within
the fallow and agricultural fields. Typical soil profiles for this portion of the APE consisted of
very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay loam overlying black (10YR 2/1) clay. It was along this
stretch of roadway that archeologists recorded Site 41EL263 (discussed below). Twenty of
the 27 shovel tests excavated along the northern portion of this roadway segment were
conducted while delineating the site boundary.
From Uhl Road to South Hampton Road
From Uhl Rd. to Hampton Rd., a length of approximately one mile, the proposed new ROW
transects agricultural fields, vacant lots, and commercial and residential development. This
stretch of roadway consists of terraced and plowed fields; graded, artificially raised and
paved surfaces; buried utilities; and roadside drainage ditches. Shovel testing took place
on all accessible parcels along this stretch of roadway where major disturbances were not
observed. Access was available to about 70 percent of the parcels in this segment where
new ROW has been proposed; however, some of the parcels where access was not available
had been graded, paved, or filled reducing the need for shovel testing. No vegetation was
observed within the agricultural fields and was limited to maintained grasses within the

existing ROW while sporadic trees were present within the proposed ROW. Archeologists
excavated 14 shovel tests within this portion of the APE (Figure 5.3).
Along the southern portion of this roadway segment, archeologists excavated three shovel
tests. These shovel tests were excavated within vacant lots and on residential property,
which displayed varying degrees of disturbances. Disturbances included land leveling,
buried utilities, and maintained lawns. Archeologists excavated an additional 11 shovel
tests along the northern portion of this roadway segment. The northern portion also
expressed many of the same disturbances as those listed above. The majority of the shovel
tests (N=6) were excavated within fallow agricultural fields while an additional three shovel
tests were placed within maintained, yet vacant lots. The remaining two shovel tests were
placed adjacent to an existing drainage. A typical soil profile consisted of black (10YR
2/1) silty clay loam overlying dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) silty clay loam overlying
dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) and very pale brown (10YR 8/3) silty loam with chalk-like
qualities. No shovel tests were positive within this roadway segment.
From South Hampton Road to Westmoreland Road
From South Hampton Rd. to Westmoreland Rd., a distance of approximately one mile,
the APE passes through mostly agricultural fields, residential lots, and some minor
commercial development. This stretch of roadway consists of terraced and plowed fields;
graded, artificially raised and paved surfaces; buried utilities; roadside drainage ditches;
and the Little Creek crossing. Shovel testing took place on all accessible parcels along this
stretch of roadway where disturbances were not observed. In addition, backhoe trenches
were excavated on both sides of Little Creek. Access was available to about 50 percent
of the parcels where new ROW has been proposed. Vegetation was nonexistent within the
agricultural fields and limited to maintained grasses within the existing ROW; however, tree
groves and thorny scrub were present along the drainages. Archeologists excavated 24
shovel tests along this segment of the APE (Figure 5.4).
Along the southern side of the roadway, seven shovel tests were excavated by archeologists.
These shovel tests were excavated within terraced agricultural fields. A typical soil profile
consisted of dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) silty loam over compact yellowish brown
(10YR 5/6) silty clay loam with calcium carbonate. Along the northern side of this roadway
segment, archeologists excavated an additional 17 shovel tests. The northern portion
consisted of numerous disturbances including commercial lots, artificially raised surfaces,
manicured lawns, and agricultural fields. A typical soil profile consisted of black (10YR 2/1)
silty loam overlying dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty loam overlying very pale brown
(10YR 8/3) chalk-like sediment.
No shovel tests were positive within this segment of roadway. However, archeologists did
observe one locality of interest (Locality A) located approximately 500 feet west of Little
Creek and north of FM 664 (discussed below).

Backhoe Trenching
Two backhoe trenches were
excavated along Little Creek.
Backhoe Trench 1 (BHT 1)
was excavated along the
northwest side of Little Creek
at its intersection with FM
664 (Figure 5.5). BHT 1 was
excavated 35 feet north of FM
664 and 115 feet west of Little
Creek. The trench was T-shaped
with a north to south oriented
trench measuring nine meters
in length and an east to west
trench measuring five meters
in length. BHT 1 was excavated
to a depth of 1.7 meters below
the surface where soils were
deemed sterile (Figure 5.6).
The soil profile observed within
this backhoe trench consisted
of black (10YR 2/1) silty
clay loam containing rootlets
overlying very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay
loam containing roots on top
of dark grayish brown (10YR
4/2) clay containing calcium
carbonate (Figure 5.7).

Figure 5.5. Backhoe Trench 1 setting, photographed facing south.

Figure 5.6. Backhoe Trench 1 post excavation.

Backhoe Trench 2 (BHT 2) was
excavated along the southeast bank of Little Creek at its intersection with FM 664 (Figure
5.8). BHT 2 was excavated 35 feet south of FM 664 and 160 feet east of Little Creek. Twentyfive feet (seven meters) north of the backhoe trench is a subsurface waterline which runs
east to west along the existing northern property line. BHT 2 measured approximately 6.5
meters in length (east to west) and extended to a depth of two meters before encountering
degraded limestone and the water table (Figure 5.9). The soil profile observed within this
backhoe trench consisted of black (10YR 2/1) silty clay loam containing rootlets and
rhabdotus shell overlying very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam on top of dark
grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay containing calcium carbonate overlying degraded bedrock
(Figure 5.10). Excavation of the backhoe trench ceased after encountering the degraded
bedrock at which time water was observed filling the bottom of the trench. No backhoe
trenches were positive along Little Creek.

Locality A

Figure 5.10. Backhoe Trench 2 soil profile.

Archeologists observed the remnants of a midtwentieth century occupation area referred
to here as Locality A north of FM 664 within
a small grove of ash juniper and thorny scrub
(Figure 5.11). This locality consists of a parking
area covered with caliche, a segment of barbed
wire fence, a mid-twentieth century Superior
short bus (which has been converted into
a trailer), a mid-twentieth century Borden’s
Milk and Ice Cream trailer, and miscellaneous
household debris dating to the late twentieth
century (Figure 5.12). Locality A is visible on
a 1968 aerial photograph Based on the size,
shape, and orientation of Locality A, as see in
Figure 5.13, the locality was likely a stock pen
and a dump site. The 1968 aerial suggests
that a barn or corral was once present at the
site. No evidence of this former structure was
observed during the current investigations.
Within the proposed new ROW the locality
extends approximately 200 feet east to west
and was observed extending 75 feet north of

the proposed new ROW.
The boundaries were
defined by agricultural
fields to the east and
west, FM 664 to the
south, and negative
shovel tests to the north.

The Superior short bus
has been converted into
a trailer (Figure 5.14).
The exact model of the
Superior short bus is
unknown; however, the
bus resembles those
models manufactured
between 1930 and the
early 1960s. The word
Barksdale is painted
above the windshield
suggesting that this
may have been a
repurposed bus once
used by the Barksdale
Air Force Base. The air
force base was founded
in 1932 near Bossier
City, Louisiana. To the
west of the Superior
short bus is a Borden’s
Milk and Ice Cream
trailer (Figure 5.15).
The trailer is composed
of a wood frame with
insulated paneling, while
the shell of the trailer
is composed of sheet
metal. The remnants of
a barbed wire fence are
in-between the modified
bus and trailer. The
fence is composed of
ash juniper fence posts
and is oriented north
to south (Figure 5.16).

to the left; roller skates; and car tires (Figure
5.17). According to the Bottle Research
Group’s Manufacturer’s Marks and Other Logos on Glass Containers (2014), the maker’s
mark described above was produced by the Chattanooga Glass Company and was in use
from 1927 to 1987. At the moment, the Superior short bus is being utilized as a geocache
locale.
Locality A was documented with six shovel tests. All of the shovel tests were negative. A
typical soil profile at Locality A consisted of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) silty clay loam
identified as mottled fill overlying caliche. Artifact density at the locality is moderate and
consists of non-archeological materials, such as tires and recent roller skates. There does
not appear to be any subsurface components. The site is frequently visited by geocaching

participants and appears to be
actively utilized as a dump by local
residents (e.g., car tires and paint
cans).
A 1953 historic aerial photograph
does not depict land use at this
location. However, as mentioned
above, Locality A is visible in a 1968
aerial photograph. Thus, the the bus
and trailer at Locality A were likely
moved to the area during the 1960s

when it began to be used as a dump or stock
pen and surface artifact debris also appears
to date to this time and later. The relatively
young age of materials coupled with lack of
any feature integrity has led investigators to
classify Locality A as locality of interest rather,
than as an archeological site.

Site 41EL263
Site 41EL263 are the remains of an historicperiod farmstead. This site consists of
shallowly buried domestic debris, two cisterns,
one well-like depression, two pier footings,
and a box construction style structure (Figure
5.18). Historic aerial photographs (ca. 1953
and 1968) depict structures at this location
(Figure 5.19). Structures are also depicted
on the 1939 county road map. In fact, a
structure situated alongside FM 664 was once
present near where archeologists observed

the well-like depression and the shallowly buried domestic debris; however, no structural
remains were identified at this location. The site is located on property owned by Marie
Hendry Keller. Within the proposed new ROW, the site extends approximately 300 feet
east to west and was observed extending northwest outside of the proposed new ROW
and easement. In total, the site measures approximately two acres in size. Site boundaries
were defined by agricultural fields to the north and east, FM 664 to the south, and a low
lying area with a north to south trending drainage to the west.

Figure 5.18. Plan map of Site 41EL263.

The site consists of six features. Feature 1 is a single course, brick-lined cistern measuring
approximately 10 feet in diameter (Figure 5.20). The pinkish, non-modular bricks used
in the cistern’s construction measure 8.5 inches in length by 4.25 inches in width by
2.5 inches in thickness (Figure 5.21). Observed bricks were bound together using high
Portland cement content mortar. The cistern has been filled with screw top, double seam
clear glass vessels; twentieth century, double seamed tin cans; and plastic containers
(e.g., bottles and motor oil). All of these artifacts appear to date to the last half of the
twentieth century. A tree is growing through the eastern wall of the cistern. Currently, the
cistern is fenced off using T-Posts and barbed wire.

Feature 2, a pier footing (Figure 5.22), is
located at the southwest corner of Feature
1. This feature measures approximately
22 inches in length by 14 inches in width
and consists of three layers of pinkish, nonmodular brick bound together using high
portland content mortar.

brick, used in the construction of the
cisterns and masonry features.

Feature 3 is situated approximately 45 feet
southwest of Feature 1. This is another pier
footing that measures 16.5 x 16.5 inches
and extends below the surface (Figure
5.23). The pinkish, non-modular bricks are
held together using high portland content
mortar.
Feature 4 is located approximately 275
feet east of Feature 1. Feature 4 is a welllike depression (Figure 5.24). No bricks
were observed in association with the
depression, which measures approximately
6.5 feet in diameter. Like Feature 1, Feature
4 is encompassed by T-Posts and barbed
wire.

Figure 5.22. Feature 2, pier footing.

Figure 5.23. Feature 3, pier footing.

Feature 5 is located approximately 450
feet northwest of Feature 1 in a low lying
area. Feature 5 is a cistern composed of
the same pinkish bricks described above
(Figure 5.25). The cistern measures
approximately 6.5 feet in diameter and is
also encompassed by T-Posts and barbed
wire. The cistern is currently filled with
discarded car tires and water. Archeologists
observed a plow blade at the northern edge
of Feature 5.
Lastly, Feature 6, located approximately
70 feet southeast of Feature 5, is a 1930
to 1940s box construction style structure
(Figure 5.26). The dwelling originally served
as a living quarters, evidenced by a brick
chimney rising from the center of the roof,
and was later converted into a barn. The

living quarters, measuring 20
feet (north to south) by 23 feet
(east to west), consisted of three
rooms and a chimney composed
of fire bricks (Figure 5.27). This
structure was constructed out
of milled lumber held together
using wire nails employing
the box construction style.
Sometime later, a shed was
added extending the structure
to the north by an additional
13 feet. Likely around the same
time, corrugated metal sheeting
was added to the outside of the
structure. Also around the same
time, an animal corral was built
at the structure’s northern end
adding an additional four and
a half feet to the feature’s total
length (see Figure 5.26B). The
structure, as it stands today,
measures approximately 33
feet in length (north to south)
by 23 feet in width (east to
west). Archeologists observed
clear window glass shards, a
fiberglass bathtub, grey PVC
pipe, and a diesel engine within
and/or around Feature 6. At
the moment, the structure is
in disrepair and is occupied by
turkey vultures.
Archeologists
excavated
20 shovel tests during the
delineation of the site’s
boundary. Six shovel tests
contained cultural debris all
within the upper 10 centimeters.
This debris consisted of three
clear window glass shards,
one whiteware sherd, three
pieces of miscellaneous metal
hardware, and a metal baking

Archeological Survey of FM 664 Project from Westmoreland Road to IH 35E, Ellis County, Texas

pan stamped “Bake King” (Figure 5.28). A
typical soil profile for the site area consisted
of very dark brown (10YR 2/2) silty clay
loam overlying black (10YR 2/1) clay loam.
Artifact density at the site is low, and the
artifacts appear to be confined to the
upper 10 centimeters. The site is located
on private property, portions of which will
be acquired by the state for proposed ROW
and easement.

Site 41EL263 consists of shallowly buried,
ephemeral, and non-diagnostic artifacts
common to historic-period farmsteads. Site
features are also common to historic-period
farmsteads. Based on aerial photographs
(ca. 1982), the main residential structure
visible in the 1968 aerial photograph was
either demolished or relocated prior to
1982. Deed research was not conducted
for this project, though the land appears
to be part of a larger tract still owned by
the Keller family. The current owner, Marie
Henry Keller, lives in Houston, and other
members of the Keller family own parcels
on the south side of FM 664 across from
Site 41EL263. According to the 1940 Ellis
County census records, a Keller family did
live in the area and were listed as farmers
(National Archives-1940 Census 2014).

Based on the unexceptional quality of the
artifacts and features at Site 41EL263
and the lack of significant association to
important themes or people in Ellis County,
the site is recommended as not eligible for listing as a SAL or in the NRHP.

Recommendations
AmaTerra surveyed proposed ROW along FM 664 from IH 35E to Westmoreland Rd. in
Ellis County, Texas. The project was conducted under Section 106 and the ACT, and work
conformed to the guidelines for implementation of these regulations under 36 CFR 800
and 13 TAC 26. Work was limited to private properties for which ROE was granted. Access
was available to approximately 70 percent of the proposed ROW. The remaining 30 percent
of proposed ROW not shovel tested by field archeologists consisted mainly of residential,
agricultural, and commercial land with no potential for archeological deposits. These areas
have been leveled, terraced, plowed, filled, and are interlaced with buried utilities removing
all potential for buried archeological deposits.
Archeologists excavated 71 shovel tests and two backhoe trenches in support of this
project. One archeological site, 41EL263, was recorded during field investigations. No
prehistoric cultural materials and/or features were observed on the surface or within
the excavated shovel tests. Archeologists observed that the APE has been heavily altered
through agricultural, residential, and commercial land use. Based on these results,
AmaTerra recommends no further work for the APE, including areas where access was not
available.
Archeologists did not collect any artifacts during this survey and therefore, none will be
curated at TARL. This report is submitted in fulfillment of Antiquities Permit No. 6812.
