ABSTRACT
In 1992, Walnut Creek Mining Company, and its agent, Morrison Knudsen Corporation, sponsored three tasks as part of its continuing cultural resource program in the
Calvert Mine. The Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at
Austin, conducted 1) eligibility testing of prehistoric campsite 41RT288, 2) full excavations at 41RT267, a Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic hunting camp in the uplands of
Walnut Creek, and 3) intensive documentation of National Register of Historic Places
farmsteads 41RT93 and 41RT302. All work was conducted in accordance with a Programmatic Agreement between Walnut Creek Mining Company, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Texas Historical Commission, and the Advisory Council on
Historic Preservation. The dispersed, sparse, and monotonous character of the artifact
assemblage at 41RT288, and the absence of intact features and buried deposits, indicated
a low information content, not meeting National Register criteria. Excavations at
41RT267 expanded upon the findings of a testing program carried out in 1986 by opening
large blocks around burned rock features buried at depths dating to the Late Prehistoric
occupation of the site. A Late Archaic component was identified and sampled for
comparisons of site function over time. The hypothesis that 41RT267 was a hunting camp,
occupied during the autumn by resource-specific procurement groups was generally
confirmed. Large format photography and detailed transit and stadia maps of the two
historic farmsteads, 41RT93 and 41RT302, fulfilled recommendations for intensive
documentation of sites determined eligible based on their representing agricultural
complexes typical of the region in the early twentieth century. The 1992 season completed all work recommended at these four sites.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
As part of the continuing cultural resources program at the Calvert Mine, Walnut
Creek Mining Company (WCMC) and its agent, Morrison Knudsen Corporation, sponsored three different tasks related to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
eligibility of sites recorded in earlier surveys. All work was governed by the provisions
of a Programmatic Agreement between WCMC, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), the Texas Historical Commission (THC), and the Advisory Council on Historic
Places and followed procedures outlined in the approved Mine Management Plan.
With Solveig A. Turpin as Principal Investigator, the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, conducted eligibility testing at 41RT288,
a prehistoric campsite identified by shovel probing a high probability area during the
1986 intensive survey of selected mine blocks. Test excavations were accomplished
between April 27 and May 4, 1992, by Jeff Turpin, Christine Ward, Barry Nowlin, Douglas
Drake, and Kam Manahan, under the supervision of David G. Robinson. The site
occupies a high ridge that parallels Walnut Creek and an oxbow slough, a relict feature
that supports abundant flora and fauna. Ten 1 by 1 meter test units and 11 backhoe
trenches were used to delineate site limits, expose a geomorphic profile, search for buried
features, and recover a sample of artifacts. The dispersed, sparse, and monotonous
character of the artifact assemblage recovered from 41RT288 and the absence of intact
features and buried deposits indicate a low information potential. Thus, 41RT288 was
considered not eligible for listing on the NRHP.
The second task undertaken in 1992 was mitigative excavation at 41RT267, determined eligible for the NRHP by a testing program carried out in 1986. These excavations
were carried out between May 4 and June 9, by the 41RT288 field staff with the addition
of Stephen M. Carpenter, Sandra Simpson, Victor Burgett, Elizabeth Stockton, and
Diane Cargill. Large blocks were opened around burned rock features identified,
recorded, and reburied in 1986. Backhoe trenches and backhoe scrapes were used to
further explore the subsurface deposits and define the limits of the Late Prehistoric and
Late Archaic components. These explorations located an additional four burned rock
features. In all, 47 test units totalling 51 square meters in area, and 11 backhoe trenches
were dug. The recovery expanded upon that of the 1986 testing program, supporting the
hypothesis that 41RT267 was a hunting camp occupied by a logistically oriented task
group and amplifying interpretations of seasonal resource exploitation during the Late
Prehistoric and Late Archaic periods in local prehistory. Mitigation of effect is considered complete.
Both projects incorporated geomorphological analyses of the local sediments. S.
Chris Caran determined various sources of bioturbation and sediment transport that

v

resulted in the burial of cultural features and the accumulation of thick sand caps in the
uplands throughout the region.
The final task of the 1992 season was the intensive documentation of two historic
farmsteads -41RT93 and 41RT302 - that had been determined eligible for the NRHP as
agricultural complexes typical of the region in the early twentieth century. In previous
projects, Dan K. Utley had carried out archival research and interviews with local
informants knowledgeable about the sequence of construction and function of the extant
buildings. Between June 17 and June 24, David G. Robinson, Daniel G. Julien, Elizabeth
Stockton, Herbert H. Eling, Jr., and Solveig A. Turpin mapped and photographed the
structures at these sites, fulfilling recommendations for mitigation of effect.

INTRODUCTION
As part of the continuing cultural resources program at the Calvert Mine, the Walnut
Creek Mining Company (WCMC) and their agent, Morrison Knudsen Corporation,
sponsored three related archeological projects that were carried out by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), The University of Texas at Austin, in 1992.
This is the fifth in a series of reports on the history and prehistory of the Calvert Mine
and is a logical consequence of previous survey, eligibility testing, and historic research
(Good, Turpin, and Freeman 1980; Davis et al. 1987; Utley, Fox, and Mehalchick 1990;
Bement and Utley 1992).
Prehistoric site 41RT288, recorded in 1986 (Davis et al. 1987:41), was tested to
determine its eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Two
historic sites that had previously been determined eligible, 41RT93 and 41RT302 (Good,
Turpin, and Freeman 1980; Davis et al. 1987), were photographically documented and
mapped. Excavations were then undertaken at prehistoric site 41RT267, an open camp
that had been evaluated as meeting National Register criteria after a limited testing
program in 1986 (Davis et al. 1987:Section II).
All work was carried out in accordance with a basic research design and methods
described in an approved Mine Management Plan (Davis et al. 1987: Section III; TARL
1989) that was devised as part of a Programmatic Memorandum between Walnut Creek
Mining Company, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Texas Historical Commission, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.
This report is organized into chapters that present introductory material, describe test
excavations at 41RT288 and report the results of full data recovery at 41RT267. The
documentation of historic sites 41RT93 and 41RT302 is summarized in an appendix to
the main report.
Environmental Setting

A complete overview of the environmental setting of the Calvert Mine has been
presented in several previous reports and will only be briefly restated here (Good, Turpin,
and Freeman 1980; Davis et al. 1987; Bement and Utley 1992). A fuller discussion of
regional paleoenvironmental models is more relevant to the interpretation of archeological sites such as 41RT288 and 41RT267. Geomorphological analyses carried out as part
of this assessment are presented in a later chapter.
The Calvert Mine lies in the northwestern portion of Robertson County, east of Texas
Highway 6 and equidistant between the communities of Calvert and Bremond (Fig. 1).

INTRODUCTION I 3

The prospect occupies the upland divide between the Brazos River, 8 miles to the west,
and the Navasota River, 22 miles to the east.
Modern climate is classified as humid and subtropical; the mean annual precipitation
is 101.9 cm and temperatures range from 87Â° C. in the winter to 29Â° C. in the summer
(Bomar 1985). Four physiographic zones were defined in the study area: active
floodplains, terraces or fossil floodplains, valley margins, and upland divides. The
geology of the region is well known from the perspective of lignite production, but
formation processes as they affect the burial of prehistoric sites have been a matter of
contention for decades. In 1986, the Soil Conservation Service mapped 19 soil units in
the Calvert Prospect. Most of the prehistoric sites recorded during Phase II survey
occupied sandy, well-drained soils on minimal slopes. These sandy soils provide a poor
preservational environment for perishable materials, thus inhibiting a reconstruction of
the resources exploited by prehistoric occupants of the region.
The native Post Oak Savanna afforded vegetational diversity that in turn supported a
broad spectrum of animal life. Forested areas provided an abundant supply of hardwood
nuts, a storable commodity, as well as fuel, building material, and other edibles. The wide
expanses of prairie were the preferred habitat of bison, deer, and rabbits. Fish, turtles,
mussels, and birds thrived in the riverine zones. Presumably, human populations exploited any and all of these econiches, but only a few bones and charred seeds have
survived in archeological sites.
PALEO ENVIRONMENT

Reconstruction of the ancient environment depends upon indirect and inferential
lines of evidence, introducing varying degrees of uncertainty into all models. Primarily,
data are drawn from fields as diverse as climatology, paleontology, palynology, and fluvial
geomorphology. Given the uncertainties, a view of the Late Pleistocene and Holocene
environment is nevertheless vital and worthwhile if we are to draw a more accurate
picture of prehistoric hunter-gatherer adaptations. Current knowledge indicates a
Quaternary sequence in Texas and the South-central United States of alternating periods
of arid and humid climate. These periods came about in response to the advances and
retreats of Pleistocene glaciers and oscillations of the global energy budget at the behest
of planetary precession, volcanic activity, and other factors. These forces have not
operated to change biota entirely, but rather to cause variations in numbers and ranges
of populations and thus alter the mosaic patterns of plant and animal communities on the
landscape (Bryant and Shafer 1977).
Currently, two broad schema compete for primacy in Texas paleoenvironmental
studies. The reconstruction by Gunn (Gunn et al. 1982; Gunn 1987) is broadly based in
physics, modern climatology, geology, oceanography, and astronomy; the theory is also
admittedly incomplete. Termed the "fluctuating change" model (Hester et al. 1989), it
characterizes Quaternary climate as one of sharp arid-humid shifts marked by short-term
but significant extremes of weather and seasonal changes. Bryant and Holloway (1985)
have criticized the Gunn et al. (1982) model for South Texas as:

4 I CAL VERT MINE 1992

Utilizing current climatic records as their data base and projecting these
trends into the past, Gunn et al. (1982) have proposed a series of alternating
wet and dry periods which may have been operating to control Holocene
climatic variations, and thus vegetation. Much of their empirical evidence
is based on phytolith data (Robinson 1979, 1982), which relies heavily on
the identification of a definable Hypsithermal interval in south Texas.
However, neither the radiocarbon dated pollen sequences from central
Texas (Graham and Heimsch 1960; Bryant 1977b) nor the plant macrofossil
records (Holloway 1985) nor the faunal (Steele 1985) evidence from south
Texas support the identification of such a discreet Hypsithermal unit within
that geographical area. Instead, the central Texas pollen and plant macrofossil record, and faunal data from south Texas suggest a gradual trend
toward aridity for at least the last 6,000 years. Based on the combined
evidence of charcoal, fauna, and pollen data we suggest that a re-evaluation
of the Gunn et al. (1982) model is warranted.
The second broad scheme is that of Bryant and Holloway (1985), building upon Bryant
and Shafer (1977), and is termed the "gradual change" model (Hester et al. 1989). The
theory, purporting to be a well-rounded scheme, holds that Quaternary climate was one
of gradual change from the cooler and moister Late Pleistocene climate to the relative
aridity of today. The model also minimizes the potential effects of dynamic fluctuations
in atmospheric and climatic processes. Observable perturbations in paleoclimate were
insignificant and failed to interrupt the general trend. Although appearing to be a mature
model of climate, the theory (Bryant and Holloway 1985) is not without questions of
methodological application, primarily an over-reliance on pollen data, as discussed
below. The summary sketch of Texas paleoenvironment offered here, focusing on the
east-central Texas area, is largely that of Bryant and Holloway (1985), with caveats
presented as warranted.
Bryant and Hollow_ay (1985:40) assert that fossil pollen grains "tend to be more evenly
distributed and thus can be directly linked to the plant taxa which produced them," but
"aboriginal groups and animals are mobile and thus their remains in archaeology or
paleontological sites sometimes can be found in ecological areas outside their optimum
habitats." Bryant and Holloway (1985) strongly prefer to study pollen as an indicator of
paleoecology because pollen more directly implies ecozones than animals and humans.
Clearly, to Bryant and Holloway, pollen analysis is a primary method of paleoecology and
paleoclimatology, and other forms of data (climatology, geomorphology, and paleontology) are secondary and merely supportive of pollen-based reconstructions of vegetation
patterns through time and the climatic patterns implied by them.
A closer look at pollen grains, plants, animals, and humans, however, diminishes the
validity and usefulness of Bryant's and Holloway's (1985) premise. Pollen grains are
organelles of plant reproductive systems evolved precisely to take advantage of the
mobility absent in the rooted, whole plant organism. And pollen grains break the
ecological bonds of the plant community, violating Bryant's and Holloway's (1985)
assumption that a pollen profile mirrors the regional ecozones. Terrestrial pollen has

been collected from 10,000 feet in the atmosphere by aircraft, and some palynologists
apply a rule of thumb for the distribution of pine pollen in detectable amounts of 200
miles radius from a reproducing stand of trees. And, although pollen is distributed
widely, the distribution is not random and uniform. Prevailing wind patterns, soil acidity,
erosion, alluvial processes, and microbial activity all serve to sort pollen, pattern its
distribution, and alter its preservation. In fairness, palynologists and paleoecologists,
including Bryant and Holloway (1985), recognize the limitations in this premise and
wrestle with its complications on a continuing basis.
Animals and aboriginal groups, on the other hand, are indeed mobile, but even when
seasonally migrating they remain linked with the adaptive niches, or habitats, on which
they are dependent for food, shelter, and breeding territory. Mobile hunter-gatherer
groups enter the habitat of target plant and animal resources and leave the byproducts
of their exploitation there or not far outside their optimum habitats. Archaeological and
paleontological sites, therefore, may be primary rather than secondary sources of ecological data in the form of animal body parts, charred seeds, nuts, wood charcoal, and other
plant macrofossils.
Although declaring the primacy of palynology and pollen analysis in paleoenvironmental reconstruction, Bryant and Holloway (1985) are not loathe to cite other forms of
data to support their arguments. Indeed, in their section on the post-glacial period of
South Texas, the text in which they criticize the Gunn et al. (1982) model, they lament
the lack of any regional pollen data at all, but go on to offer a reconstruction based on
plant macrofossils and zooarcheology (Bryant and Holloway 1985:60-61).
As stated above, the Bryant and Holloway (1985) model is based strongly in pollen
analysis, and their results are couched in terms of a vegetation history with appended
notes on implications for paleoclimate. The Wisconsin Full-Glacial Period, 22,50014,000 B.P., in the eastern portions of central Texas supported a heavily forested
landscape with mixed deciduous-conifer open-canopy communities. These include some
spruce, pine, shrub alder, basswood, maple, poplar, and oak. Climate was cooler than
today, commensurate with these more boreal plants and communities (Bryant and Holloway 1985:47-50).
Late Glacial times, 14,000 to 10,000 B.P., witnessed the gradual reduction of
temperate arboreal elements from the forests, a shift from woodlands to par klands and
a trend away from temperate, mesic conditions to a drier regime. Boriack Bog in Lee
County shows the loss of spruce, hazelnut, waxmyrtle, basswood, and maple from the Late
Glacial segment of the pollen profile (Bryant and Holloway 1985:52-53).
The Postglacial Period, 10,000 B.P. to present, was a period of subtle changes relative
to the foregoing Late Glacial. In central Texas, the period was marked by the end of
deciduous forests and woodlands and the gradual emergence of prairies and post oak
savannas. Pollen profiles in bogs are marked by stable percentages of oak pollen and
gradually increasing grasses and shrubs. The Post Oak Savanna as a floral province
(Gould 1975) may have become established no later than 1500 years ago. Pollen records
for all regions of Texas suggest an ongoing drying trend beginning about 6000 years ago
(Bryant and Holloway 1985:56, 61-64). The Altithermal of Western North America

6 I CALVERT MINE 1992

(Hypsithermal in Eastern North America) is not discussed by Bryant and Holloway for
any region of Texas except in their critique of the Gunn et al. (1982) model for South
Texas, quoted above. This lack accentuates Bryant's and Holloway's picture of fairly
stable, xeric-trending climate in the Postglacial period.
Drying is not the trend reported by historic writers who traveled through Robertson
County and the region, and whose observations were collected by Weniger (1984). The
region was described in 1840 on approaches from the east through prairies with masses
of trees, predominantly pine and oak: "when nearing the Brassos the pine begins to
disappear and its place is supplied along the Brassos and Colorado with great quantities
of live oak" (Stiff 1968 in Weniger 1984:7). Included among counties reported to have
been almost entirely forested, Robertson County in 1861 was described as
Upon the creeks .. there are also large bodies of rich bottomlands, heavily
timbered with oak, and in many places with cedar and walnut. The low lands
on the rivers also afford a heavy growth of oak, and in some portions cedar
... The up-lands, consisting of post-oak, black-jack, interspersed [sic] with
hickory, are generally regarded as of inferior quality ... This country has
more timbered land than any other in this middle portion of the State ..
(Weniger 1984:51)
Clearly, forests were dense in upland Robertson County, and tree cover was generally
more widespread than today, especially on the Brazos plain, now stripped for cultivation.
More importantly, the prairies and Post Oak Savanna were richer in grasses and trees,
respectively, than they are defined for the modern era by Gould (1975). Regional creeks
such as Walnut and Big Willow flowed under full gallery forests. That this mosaic has
some time depth is supported in regional pollen profiles.
Boriack Bog in Lee County shows an increase in both oak and grass pollen above the
10,000 B.P. level. Their percentages remained stable to the top of the profile. Gause Bog
in Milam County shows a parallel pattern of increase and levelling to a stable plateau of
oak and grass pollen later than 10,000 B.P. Soefje and South Soefje bogs in Gonzales
County are not tied directly to radiocarbon dates, but they too have significant and stable
percentages of oak, grasses, ash, and pecan through the upper meter and a half of deposit
(Bryant and Holloway 1985:49, 54, 62-63).
The time depth of this environmental pattern is not fully determined, but it may well
have had implications for 41RT288 and 41RT267. Both the sites may have been formed,
at least in their Late Prehistoric occupations, in fully forested environments. Potential
resource spectra lay in the realm of forest plants, animals, and their byproducts. Their
value as overlooks of game water sources was probably less than is suggested by modern
vegetative cover. Conversely, concealment and security as locational values were
heightened.

INTRODUCTION I 7

Cultural Setting

Davis et al. (1987) present a detailed discussion of previous archeological research in
the Calvert Mine, its region, and adjacent cultural areas (See also Bement and Utley
1992). Projects completed since that writing have done little to clarify the local cultural
trajectory, instead restating the obvious problems inherent in research that concentrates
on the upland zones that produce lignite rather than the whole spectrum of lifezones
utilized by prehistoric people.
The chronology used here follows the traditional sequence applied throughout Texas:
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric and Historic. The Archaic period begins with the
arrival of human populations in the region and extends to about 1000 B.P. (before present;
Fields 1984:6). The Late Prehistoric Period, from 1000 to 300 B.P., is recognized by the
introduction of the bow and arrow and the adoption of ceramics. The influence of
Europeans marks the start of the Historic Period, ca. A.D. 1700. Only the Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric periods are relevant to excavations at 41RT288 and 41RT267. The
very general nature of the local chronology, when compared to the detailed sequences
proposed in adjacent Central Texas and the Caddo area, underscores the lack of
stratigraphically distinct occupation levels and organic material suitable for radiocarbon
dating in the immediate area of the Calvert Mine.
The history of Robertson County in general and the Calvert Mine specifically has also
been the subject of a number of recent reports (Good, Turpin, and Freeman 1980; Davis
et al. 1987; Utley, Fox, and Mehalchick 1990; Bement and Utley 1992). Although
Robertson County was at the center of early colonization in Texas, the upland areas of
the Calvert Mine were not developed until after the Civil War.
PREVIOUS WORK IN THE CALVERT MINE

Sampling survey of the Calvert Mine began in 1978 as part of a larger project intended
to gain a first approximation of cultural resources in two large areas of Robertson County
(Good, Turpin, and Freeman 1980). Forty prehistoric and 21 historic sites were recorded
in the 23,000 acres designated as the Calvert Lignite Prospect, an area much larger than
that considered in later studies. Prehistoric studies concentrated on identifying high
probability locations so that a predictive model could be applied to unsurveyed areas.
The historic research was more general, presenting an overview of settlement and
development in the county.
In 1985, TARL carried out an intensive survey of 4800 acres, including the first mine
permit area and auxiliary facilities. A total of 78 sites, 32 prehistoric and 46 historic, were
recorded and 4 sites, 2 prehistoric and 2 historic, were reassessed. To counter the masking
effect of the sandy soils in this region, shovel probes were dug in high probability areas,
identifying 17 prehistoric sites that were not manifested on the surface. Among those
were 41RT288 and 41RT267, whose later excavation is reported here. The predictive
model begun in 1978 was further refined and tested during this survey.
The 46 historical properties recorded in 1985 and 1986 consist largely of farmhouses,
share cropper cottages, and associated outbuildings. Many were associated with the
dispersed community of Tidwell Prairie, whose store, church, and school served central

8 I CALVERT MINE 1992

place functions. All the sites postdate the mid-1870s. The Weaver-Rushing house and
store, 41RT260, was determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) and several other sites were considered potential candidates (Davis et al. 1987).
In May of 1986, prehistoric campsite 41RT267 was tested and found eligible for the
NRHP. That testing program is summarized later in this report. The results of the initial
intensive survey, testing at 41RT267, and historic research were used to prepare a Mine
Management Plan (TARL 1989) that outlined a comprehensive research design for future
work in the project area and detailed procedures to be used to obtain the research goals.
The research design, as far as it applies to excavation of campsite 41RT267, is summarized
in a later section of this report. As part of the Mine Management Plan, four historic study
units were defined by Utley: Polish-Texans (1875 to present); Blacks (Post-Civil War to
Present); Anglo-Americans (1870s to Present) and Land Utilization (1870s to 1950s).
One of the historic farmsteads documented in the appendix to this report, 41RT302, is
attributable to the Polish-Texan community.
In 1989, the effects of mining on NRHP site 41RT260 were mitigated by photography,
limited testing, and architectural drawings produced to Historical American Building
Standards (Utley, Fox, and Mehalchick 1990). Eligibility testing of six other historic
farmsteads was carried out at the same time but only 41RT254, outside the permit area,
seemed to meet criteria.
In 1990, an additional 2450 acres of the second permit area were surveyed, locating
and recording 14 historic sites, 8 prehistoric sites, and 2 multi-component sites (Bement
and Utley 1992). Nine historic and ten prehistoric sites recorded in previous surveys
were reassessed. The newly recorded prehistoric sites were evaluated as less informative
than the reassessed properties. The enlarged study area incorporated buildings attributable to the dispersed Black community, introducing some variability into the
composition of the historic site inventory. Sites 41RT93 and 41RT302, recorded in 1978
and 1986 respectively, were determined eligible for listing on the NRHP. The mitigation
of the effects of mining on those properties is reported in an appendix.

METHODS
Excavation methods and procedures followed guidelines set forth in the approved
Mine Management Plan (TARL 1989), supplemental to the Programmatic Memorandum,
and were the same at 41RT288 and 41RT267, with minor variations. The principal means
of excavation, both by number of units worked and area of site exposed, was hand
excavation of 1by1 meter square excavation units. At 41RT288, these units were placed
volitionally in areas thought to have higher potential for artifacts and subsurface contexts.
At 41RT267, they were aligned with the relocated 1986 test pits, and where feasible, were
contiguous so that larger excavation blocks opened wider areas of the site. At both sites,
the excavation units were oriented to magnetic north. The units at 41RT288 were
designated by letters of the alphabet and, at 41RT267, by Arabic numerals.
Excavation of the hand units proceeded in 10 centimeter arbitrary levels.
Stratigraphic levels were anticipated, which would allow excavation by more meaningful
natural stratification, but none were clearly identified at either site. A standard, UT-Austin General Record Form was completed for every excavation level. These forms
comprise the principal record of the hand unit excavations. Black-and-white and color
photographs of the excavated levels were taken only when the levels exposed features,
significant artifacts in situ, or other suspected cultural contexts. All the matrix from the
hand units was screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth, and all cultural material was
collected in labeled excavation bags. A column of pollen samples was collected in 5 cm
intervals from the west wall of the deepest excavation unit, Test Pit 20. Feature fill was
bagged for pollen analysis and flotation. Soil samples were taken from immediately
below each feature for radiocarbon assay of the organic fraction. Burned rock from in
situ features was collected, weighed, and returned to the laboratory for analysis; burned
rock scattered throughout the cultural levels was weighed and discarded except for a
small sample kept for qualitative comparisons.
A second important method at both sites was the excavation of backhoe trenches
(BHTs). These were dug to provide stratigraphic profiles long enough to allow accurate
observations and to open additional areas quickly. The trenches were excavated with a
machine provided by the Walnut Creek Mining Company. The hoe was equipped with
an 18 11 wide bucket. The entire backhoe operation was monitored carefully to detect and
minimize any impact to intact cultural contexts. The BHTs were located volitionally and
mapped in after excavation to relate them to the overall excavations. Representative
profiles were drawn, also on a selected basis. At 41RT267, the trenches could not be
profiled due to the exceptionally heavy seasonal rains of 1992, which heavily scored the
sandy walls, filled the trenches with water, and created a serious work hazard.
Photographs taken at the time of excavation form the only consistent mode of documentation of the 41RT267 BHTs. A modified technique of backhoe trenching was also

9

10 I METHODS

employed at 41RT267. In order to locate more burned rock features, a large area was
scraped in increments using the backhoe with bucket inverted. The flat back of the
bucket was then scraped laterally on the ground in a side-to-side arc. The sandy soil was
removed easily in this fashion, down to the probable level of the Late Prehistoric hearths
established in the hand excavations. Two separate areas were scraped in this manner,
and Feature 8 was located without serious disturbance.
Artifacts were analyzed following procedures established by Tomka (Davis, et al.
1987) to insure comparability between the testing and mitigation phases at 41RT267.
Pollen samples were submitted to PaleoResearch Laboratories in Denver, Colorado and
soil samples were assayed at The University of Texas Radiocarbon Laboratory. S.
Christopher Caran provided geomorphological assessments of the prehistoric sites; Dan
K. Utley supervised the documentation of the historic sites.
A plan to mitigate the effects of mining on historic sites 41RT93 and 41RT302 was
devised by TARL and approved by the regulatory agencies. Both these farmsteads were
mapped in AUTOCAD using transit and stadia measurements. The standing structures
were documented by large format black and white photography. Interiors and architectural features were further recorded in 35 mm black and white prints and color slides.
Taped interviews with previous occupants were transcribed for curation.
All the documentation generated by this project is curated at TARL. Artifacts
recovered from 41RT267 will be returned to the landowner, Lester Hailey, at his request.

SIGNIFICANCE TESTING OF 41RT288
This prehistoric open campsite was identified by a series of shovel probes used to
search for buried deposits in a high probability area during the 1985-1986 intensive
cultural resource survey of the Calvert Mine (Davis et al. 1987: 41, Table 2). A high ridge
paralleling Walnut Creek and overlooking the floodplain seemed an optimal location for
exploitation of upland and riverine resources. No evidence of prehistoric occupation was
noted on the surface, but three shovel tests recovered 37 pieces of lithic debitage and a
burned quartzite rock. The probes failed to reach the basal clay. The site was recommended for extensive test excavations based on these findings and the size of the
landform (Fig. 2).
Site Setting and Geomorphology

The position of site 41RT288 atop a high ridge, ca. 10 meters above the Walnut Creek
floodplain, places it at the edge of a large expanse of the Brazos uplands, here supporting
native Post Oak Savanna. With modern human modification, the landscape now consists
of wide pastures of cultivated grasses and invader species dotted with scattered oak trees
and a few hickorys (Fig. 3a). The site directly overlooks an oxbow slough of Walnut
Creek, a relict feature that supports abundant aquatic flora and fauna. The slough is fed
and maintained primarily by groundwater seeps which form on the mid and lower slopes
of the ridge as water flowing through the upper sands strikes the impervious lower clay
strata; such seeps appeared in the lower BHTs during the test excavations. Hydrophyllic
grasses and other plants that concentrate around the slough also grow across the
floodplain to the modern channel where they give way to a dense overstory of willows,
pecans, hickorys, and a few oaks. The understory is thickened with hackberry, greenbriar,
woody shrubs, and poison ivy, in places impenetrably. Altogether, in its native setting,
41RT288 would have been proximal to three microenvironments, each with varied and
overlapping sets of subsistence resources.
Soils are thick sandy profiles with minimal organic concentrations in their upper
layers and clayey basal zones (Figs. 3a, 4 ). Transitions are gradual and variable, marked
by clay mottling. While the soils formed in situ, the overall depths of sand layers
increased downhill, to a maximum of about 2 meters. At the base of the slope, mixed
alluvial deposits of sand, clay, and silt truncate the sand-dominated profiles.

The Excavations
The test excavations were conducted by a six-member field party between April 27
and May 4, 1992. Due to the extremely large size of the site, estimated at 400 by 100
meters, machine excavation was used to delimit the extent of buried cultural material.
Ten 1by1 meter test pits and eleven backhoe trenches that totalled 77.85 meters in length
were dug. An area of 45 square meters of the site was excavated, combining the test pits
and trenches. The test squares were oriented to magnetic north and distributed along
the top of the slope in places selected to maximize cultural recovery. The backhoe
trenches were oriented at right angles to the ground slope with the exception of Trench
11, which was aligned parallel to the slope. The trenches were located at the top of the
slope, midslope, and on the floodplain (Fig. 2). Specific excavation methods are
described in Chapter 2 of this report.

Artifacts
LITHIC ARTIFACTS
Cobbles and Cores

Two stones which may have been worked were recovered from Test Pits G and H. One
object (7-9) is petrified wood and appears unworked. The other object, 8-4, is quartzite
and is fragmentary. The breakage appears not to be from flake production. The unbroken end shows no battering, and the object has no impact cones from stream rolling.
Bifaces

Two bifacial stone artifacts were in unfinished stages of production. Specimen 7-6 is
thick enough to be a Stage 3 biface, one in the middle of the manufacturing process. It
is fragmentary, the break a manufacturing failure. Specimen 11-1 is relatively thinner
and is possibly at Stage 4 or S. It also is fragmentary, but due to a use breakage (and
shock). Both artifacts are chert and products of core reduction technology.
Unifaces

Two specimens were apparently worked on one face, one each from Test Pits C and
H. The preparation of the flakes was so minimal that they may be viewed as utilized
flakes with prepared working edges. They are described here as unifaces but they also
enter the utilized flake analysis. Specimen 8-28 was a primary chert flake, but edge
preparation on the dorsal face removed cortex near the distal end to create a concave
retouched working edge and a secondary flake. Specimen 3-7, also of chert, has a working
edge on the dorsal face. The edge was formed both by deliberate retouch and use nibbling
or fracturing.
Projectile Points

Two fragmentary chert projectile points (Fig. S) were recovered from Test Pits G and
H. Specimen 7-18, from Test Pit 6, Level 12, is a fragmentary Kent dart point (Fig. Sb),
diagnostic of the Middle and Late Archaic periods between 2000 B.C. and A.D. SOO
(Turner and Hester 198S:110). The dart point shows a perverse fracture, indicating
breakage in manufacture. The Kent point was produced by core reduction. Specimen
8-2, Test Pit H, Level 1, is a fragmentary Cuney arrow point (Fig. Sa), diagnostic of the
Late Prehistoric/Early Ceramic period (Turner and Hester 198S:l 71). Although complete, the point has a shear fracture across the blade, diagnostic of a manufacturing break.
It is a product of flake technology.
Utilized Flake

A single utilized chert flake/modified debitage specimen was recovered from Test Pit
F. The irregularly shaped secondary flake has a single worked edge 8.S mm long on one
lateral edge. Edge-wear is by use only, and it has some rounding.

CERAMICS

A single potsherd was unearthed from Test Pit H, Level 4. The tan, smoothed rolling
exterior with fine striations suggests smoothing with a rough-surfaced material. The
interior surface appears to be effaced. The core of the sherd has an extremely rough
texture with numerous voids and pores. Some of the holes are part of tubes which may
have been formed when rodlike plant parts or other organic matter was burned out during
firing. In spite of this possibility, the core lacks a carbon streak. The tempering agent is
crushed potsherds (grog), which suggests East Texas affinities, although the specimen is
too small to allow direct typological comparisons.
ECO FACTS

Plant Macrofossils

Thirty-six seeds of an unknown plant were recovered from Test Pit C, Level 1. The
seeds are all fresh and probably modern.
HISTORIC ARTIFACTS

Fencing Staple

A single heavily rusted staple was recovered from Test Pit B, Level 2. This
stratigraphic position suggests its loss or discard during modern fencing activities.
DISCUSSION OF ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS

The spatial distribution of lithic debris (Table 1) is valuable for defining the cultural
zone of the site in the absence of stratigraphic patterning or living floors defined by
features. More material was recovered from the southern area of the site, specifically
Test Pits F, G and H, than the northern portion. Stratigraphically, all the artifacts were
contained within essentially a sand profile, but debitage was densest in the upper three
levels, down to 30 ems below the surface. From there, densities fall to a plateau of about
45 flakes per level through Level 7. Below 70 centimeters, the sparse recovery may well
be a function of mixing as well as human activity.

Bioturbation is an important factor affecting the distribution of cultural material and
sedimentation. Burrowing ground-dwelling animals, once ubiquitous in these sandy
soils, have been replaced by fire ants as the most active source of displacement. Piping,
a form of erosion resulting from the discharge of ground water on a persistent or seasonal
basis, has enhanced retreat of the lower slopes at 41RT288 (See 41RT267, Geomorphology for a fuller discussion of piping). Cultural material was less common in the profile
at this site than at 41RT267 and no samples were collected for radiocarbon-age determination or textural analysis. Given the close similarity between the sections at 41RT288
and at 41RT267, landscapes at these sites probably underwent comparable genetic
histories.

Summary and Conclusions

The testing program at 41RT288 failed to produce any evidence of intact buried
cultural deposits. Despite the wide area of the site tested and the exposures provided by
numerous backhoe trenches, no features were uncovered. Burned rock scattered through
the sandy matrix of southern test pits G, H, and J is the only testimonial to domestic
activities that took place at the site (Table 2). The fragmentary projectile points and one
potsherd document occupation during the Middle to Transitional Archaic period and the
Late Prehistoric/Early Ceramic period. In addition, these artifacts suggest that the
people who left them behind were affiliated with East Texas groups rather than Central
Texas populations but all the lithic raw material is locally available. Although 41RT288
occupies an optimal location for the procurement of aquatic flora and fauna from the
oxbow slough and Walnut Creek, no clear evidence of the exploited resources was
recovered. Bioturbation and erosion were factors affecting the integrity of both natural
and cultural deposits. The scattered and sparse distribution of cultural material limits
the information potential of 41RT288 and, in our opinion, renders the site ineligible for
listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

41RT267, THE BIG WILLOW CREEK SITE
Introduction

In December of 1985, during the intensive survey of the first Calvert Mine permit
area, 41RT267, the Big Willow Creek site, was found by shovel probing a high ridge that
seemed an attractive location for prehistoric occupation (Davis et al. 1987:37-38). The
site was estimated to be 70 by 200 meters in area, the long axis paralleling the channel of
Big Willow Creek, a perennial spring-fed stream (Figs. 9, lOa). Low rises at the north
and south ends of the landform are separated by a broad swale that results in a site-configuration that resembles a saddle.
Four probes recovered 53 pieces of lithic chipping debris and a Steiner arrow point,
a specimen of East Texas affiliation and indicative of Late Prehistoric use of the site.
None of the 90-cm deep probes reached basal clay, raising the possibility of deeply buried
cultural deposits. Much of the site was wooded, indicating that agricultural practices,
such as plowing, had not affected its subsurface integrity. Based on the site's regional
setting in an upland environment, its local setting above the confluence of Big Willow
and Walnut creeks, and the context provided by the known settlement pattern, it was
postulated that 41RT267 was a hunting camp, occupied at least during the Late Prehistoric period by people influenced by an East Texas cultural tradition (Davis et al.
1987:135).
The Testing Program, 1986

Testing to evaluate site significance against National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) criteria was recommended and undertaken in May of 1986 (Davis et al. 1987).
Seven backhoe trenches were used to define the site limits, search for subsurface features,
and expose a stratigraphic profile. Twelve test pits, totalling 16 square meters, were hand
excavated. The first series was placed equidistant along the north-south axis of the site.
The high artifact recovery and exposure of buried burned rock features on the northern
knoll top, contrasted with the low recovery in the swale and on the southern knoll, was
further explored by the next three units. The final effort concentrated on clearing,
recording, and reburying the intact burned rock features of the northern knoll.
The 1986 field work documented five burned rock features, one of which was virtually
removed by backhoe testing of the southern knoll so only its provenience could be
recorded. A second feature consisted of an amorphous cluster of burned sandstone on
the southern slope of the northern knoll in Test Pit 2. The three largest and most intact
features were uncovered atop the northern knoll. A thermoluminescence date of

1350Â± 160 years was obtained from Feature 3, a shallow rock-lined pit that is discussed
further in a later section of this chapter.
The distribution of artifacts across the site confirmed that the northern knoll top held
the most information potential. The five test pits and four backhoe trenches placed in
the middle and southern portions of the site returned only 31 % of the site total inventory
and only 13% of the projectile points. The northern knoll top produced 60% of the lithic
debitage, 20 of the 23 projectile points in addition to the arrow point found during survey,
and all four ceramic fragments. In addition, the stratigraphic integrity was demonstrated
by the recovery of 14 of 17 arrow points from the upper 30 cm of the test units, reflecting
their late deposition in the cultural sequence of site occupation. The dominance of arrow
points and the recovery of ceramics dated the major component of the site to the Late
Prehistoric/Early Ceramic period; a few charred nut hulls indicated a seasonal occupation
during the autumn, possibly preparatory to the rigors of winter.
The hypothesis that 41RT267 was a hunting camp, occupied seasonally and sporadically, was tested by detailed lithic analyses carried out by Tomka (Davis et. al 1987). Six
expectations were stated: 1) a low frequency of personal gear, with the exception of
projectile points, because of their curated nature; 2) a higher recovery of expedient tools
or situational gear; 3) projectile points well represented by fragments broken by use and
manufacture; 4) exhausted cores; 5) lithic debitage from all stages of reduction with an
over-representation of tertiary flakes; and 6) debitage small in size resulting from late
stages of arrow point manufacture (Davis et al. 1987:138). Based on his analysis, Tomka
concluded that
41RT267 was primarily a hunting camp where expedient tasks related to
tool maintenance and food processing were performed and where core
reduction, arrow point manufacture, and the reduction of staged artifacts
were the prime components of the lithic technology (Davis et al. 1987: 160).
The sum total of the evidence, then, supported the hypothesis that 41RT267 was a
seasonally occupied (autumn) hunting camp, at least during the Late Prehistoric period.
The site was determined eligible for the NRHP based on its relevance to problems in
regional prehistory. The mitigation plan recommended focusing further excavations on
the substantive data concentrated in the northern knoll by opening a broad area around
the hearths that had been documented and reburied during the testing program. Secondarily, interest was directed toward a small area of deeper deposits, also on the northern
knolltop, and toward geomorphological interpretation of the undulating surface and
subsurface strata.
Research Design for the Mitigation Of 41RT267

The Mine Management Plan (TARL 1989) attempted to outline avenues where
prehistoric research would prove most fruitful in future studies at the Calvert Mine. The
study area was defined as the catchment basin of Walnut Creek, an upland zone that was
probably only seasonally occupied or exploited by groups of people that lived on the

41RT267 I 29

major waterways - the Brazos and Navasota rivers. Three assumptions inform the course
of further work:
1) the project area meets the definition of a provident resource base with ample
subsistence opportunities for hunters and gatherers;
2) the semi-sedentary settlement pattern noted along the Brazos River in early
historic times could claim some time depth; and
3) survey and testing in the Calvert Prospect would provide evidence capable of
testing hunter-gatherer adaptive models from the perspective of the uplands.
Primarily, these adaptive models dealt with the concept of hunter and gatherer
mobility and various measures of subsistence economy and efficiency. It was generally
concluded that the Robertson County uplands were sporadically occupied by logistically
ordered task groups who exploited the available resources on a scheduled, seasonal basis.
The latter implies a level of efficiency that is often described as an optimal foraging mode
and it, in turn, demands that the environment be capable of sustaining a structured
society. Early historic documents indicate that the Brazos River and environs provided
abundant plant and animal foods so that semi-sedentary groups could maintain base
camps along the river and procure additional goods via forays into other ecological zones,
such as the uplands of Walnut Creek.
If this model is correct, 41RT267 represents the upland component of a seasonal

round that probably saw specific task groups traveling up Walnut Creek in search of game
and hardwood nuts. The mitigation program was primarily oriented toward data recovery
to increase our sample of material from 41RT267 and to determine if this postulated
function could be attributed to earlier Archaic components at the site. The specific test
of this proposed time depth is a comparison of the Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic
occupation zones defined in the 1992 excavations. A comparison of functionally loaded
artifact classes, in this case utilized flakes/modified debitage, permitted a systematic test
of continuities or discontinuities of site function between the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods.
Additionally, spatial analysis of the site's burned rock features and artifact distributions contributed to this effort, primarily by application of site function and behavior
models proposed by Brooks and Yellen (1987). Their observations, based in ethnoarcheology, of site reuse and reoccupation were thought to be of value in relating the Big
Willow Creek Site to overall patterns of aboriginal mobility and settlement.
1992 Excavations

The mitigation program at 41RT267 was carried out between May 4, 1992 and June
9, 1992, a period lengthened somewhat by delays caused by the extraordinary, record-setting spring rains of 1992. Crew size varied between four and eight members. The first
task was the relocation of the 1986 test pits and their remaining features. The primary
datum on the northern knoll had become buried by sand and organic debris but it was
located by a metal detector. Test pits 8, 11, and 12 were found by clearing brush in

--------------------

30 I CALVERT MINE 1992

reference to the 1986 site map. Test Pit 10 was rediscovered when Backhoe Trench 8 was
excavated. The remaining 1986 test pits could not be relocated.
In all, 35 test pits were dug during the 1992 excavations (Fig. 9). The 1 by 1 meter
squares were oriented to magnetic north and aligned with the 1986 test pits. Subsequent
squares were placed contiguously in order to open the largest possible area of the site.
In this way, two major excavation blocks were excavated on the northern knoll (Fig. 9a).
Excavation Block A (Fig. lOb) was nearer the prime datum and was expanded from
relocated pits 8 and 11, which contained part of Feature 3. Excavation Block B was
farther north and topographically lower than Excavation Block A. It expanded from Test
Pit 12, dug originally as a deep test to find the cultural bottom of the site. Test pits 17,
18, 19, and 20 in Excavation Block B continued the enterprise of Test Pit 12, finding the
bottom of the site and the Late Archaic occupation zone. Test pits 47, 48, and 49 formed
a small and undesignated block between blocks A and B, extending from Test Pit 10, to
expose Feature 4. Due to uncertainties in the exact replacement of Test Pit 10, this small
block of excavation squares was oriented approximately 30 degrees west of north rather
than north. Test pits 60, 62, and 63 were dug in a backhoe scrape on the southern knoll
to excavate Feature 8. They formed Excavation Block C.
In conjunction with the hand excavation of the 1 by 1 meter units, machine excavation
opened four backhoe trenches (BHT) and two scrapes (Fig. 9). BHT 8 was dug in the
northern knoll area, and BHTs 9, 10, and 11 were placed in the southern knoll area (Fig.
9b). Two backhoe scrapes were also opened in the southern knoll area; Feature 8 was
discovered in one of them. A pavement hearth was exposed in the west profile of BHT
10. Erosion of the profile by heavy rains destroyed the feature before it could be
designated or cleared by hand excavation. The feature was recorded by descriptive notes
and excavation photographs before its loss. Altogether, 28 linear meters of site surface
were opened by the BHTs. Applying a bucket-width of 18 inches, the BHTs exposed an
area of 12.7 square meters. Combined with the area of the 1by1 m units, a total of 47.7
square meters of the site was excavated by hand and machine excavation methods, in
1992. In all, 47 hand excavated units, totalling 51 square meters in area, and 11 backhoe
trenches were dug at 41RT267 in the testing and mitigation phases.
In addition to these major excavation efforts, three shovel probes were dug near the
Big Willow Creek Site at the request of the Walnut Creek Mine. The mine wanted a more
precise determination of the northern cultural boundary of the site in anticipation of
earth-moving activities well north of the mapped site limits. Accordingly, three probes
(SPl, SP2, and SP3) were dug in a linear pattern northward from the northern boundary
of the site. Probe fill was screened but not divided into excavation levels. This procedure
established the northern limit satisfactorily, and the mine's efforts proceeded without
any cultural impacts.
FEATURES

Three burned rock features were exposed in the 1992 excavations. Added to the five
found in the 1986 excavations, eight features have been documented at the Big Willow
Creek Site. The 1992 features are numbered in sequence with those from 1986. Features
3 and 4, discovered in 1986, were found to be more extensive than when originally cleared

and are described again here. All the burned rock features were found in the Late
Prehistoric cultural zone and all are made primarily of sandstone. The feature fill also
contained a few quartzite and petrified wood pebbles and chert flakes. In some of the
features, notably Feature 4, larger nodules of petrified wood may have been hammerstones or other artifacts. In all, by overwhelming mass of material and intention of
construction, the features are of Simsboro sandstone, locally outcropping and available
downhill east of the site, toward Big Willow Creek.
Feature 3

This feature was partially cleared and described in 1986 and completely exposed in
1992 (Fig. 11). The approximate diameter of the central portion of the hearth is 0.80
meters. The feature was found in parts of test pits 8, 11, 13, and 14 at depths between 35
and 40 cm below the surface. The weight of burned rock in the feature is 72.45 kg.
Although the full clearance and exposure of the feature substantially enlarged its
dimensions, the original interpretation of Feature 3 (Davis et al. 1987: 129-131) remains
accurate. The feature shape is roughly oval to circular; the perimeter of rocks is denser
and layered, suggesting removal and stacking of rocks from the center after firing. A
tightly stacked group of rocks southeast of the feature proper may have served as
additional supply for the hearth. Altogether, the feature's discreteness, materials, and
formality of preparation and use bespeak multiple firings and specific warming and
cooking functions. A thermoluminescence sample taken from the feature in 1986 yielded
an assay of 1350 B.P.Â±160 (Alpha 3052; Davis et al. 1987:131).

32 I CALVERT MINE 1992

Feature 4

Feature 4 was found in 1986 and completely exposed in 1992. The feature is approximately 1.4 meters in diameter and was spread over parts of test pits 10, 47, 48, 49,
and 50. Feature rocks were found between 33 and 48 cm below the surface. The burned
rock weighed 84.34 kg.
Feature 4 varied markedly in morphology and probable function from those inferred
from its partial exposure in 1986 (Davis et al. 1987:132-133). Fully exposed, the hearth
is irregular-to-ovoid in plan with numerous scatters and clusters of burned rock around
the central mass (Fig. 12a). In-situ fractures of rocks were numerous throughout the
feature, and the eastern portion of the feature has several stacked rocks, in some places
four layers thick. Five cobbles of petrified wood were scattered through the feature, and
may have been chopping or pounding artifacts which were incorporated into the hearth
or used near the fire. The irregular shape and distribution of the feature's materials
suggest repetitive use and little formality of maintainence. The hearth may have been a
shallow pit or a pavement with fuel stacked on the rocks.
Feature 6

This feature is approximately 0.9 meters in diameter, and was exposed in test pits 21
and 22. The burned rock extended from 33 to 38 cm below the surface and weighed 42.66
kg.
The feature was probably ovoid originally but now appears in plan as a disrupted
rectangle by virtue of lines of rocks on the southwest and northwest peripheries (Fig.
12b ). Eastward, the rocks are scattered and show no patterns. A central cluster is
surrounded by relatively few scattered rocks. The configuration indicates either a small
pit oven from which the central rocks were removed after firing or a flat, stone-bordered
hearth into which peripheral stones were thrown, perhaps to help extinguish it. The
former interpretation is preferred, as all the feature rock has been converted by heat to
red and reddish-black colors. Bordering stones might not be so markedly affected by
heat.
Feature 7

The feature is approximately 1.0 meters in diameter, and was unearthed in test pits
23 and 24. Burned rock was found between 50 and 52 cm below the surface. The total
weight of the rock is 13.06 kg.
In plan, Feature 7 shows an ovoid-to-circular shape, described by an arc of burned
rock around the southern and eastern perimeters of the feature (Fig. 13a). Rocks are
scattered outside the feature and in the center of the hearth. Many of the peripheral
rocks are fire-cracked in place, and all are heavily burned. The burned, scattered rock
indicates removal or dispersal after hearth firing. The lower density of interior rocks and
the overall size of the feature give it similarities with Feature 6, approximately 30 cm to
the northwest. Functions as a small pavement or shallow pit hearth from which stones
were removed are the most probable, with interpretation as a stone-bordered hearth with
post-firing disruption a lesser possibility.

Feature 8

The feature is approximately 0.80 meters in diameter, and was unearthed in Test Pits
60 and 62 after initial discovery in a backhoe scrape. Burned rock was distributed
between 33 and 48 cm below the surface and weighs 6.59 kg.
The feature was heavily disrupted prehistorically, and its overall shape in plan cannot
be discerned (Fig. 13b ). Peripheral rocks are stacked in several places, in three layers
on the northern edge. Many of the peripheral stones are fire-cracked in place. The
interior of the feature contains only a few stones, and there is a wide scatter of hearth
stones south of the feature. Feature 8 was most similar in size, morphology, and function
to Features 6 and 7. This is inferred primarily from the relatively open hearth interior
and well-defined outer edge.
ARTIFACTS

Lithic Artifacts
HAMMERS TONES

Nine hammerstones were recovered (Table 3), five of them quartzite and four
petrified wood. One of the quartzite specimens, 61-2, has percussion rings indicative of
stream rolling. Hammering marks were in the form of light to moderate roughening of
the ends and some of the edges of the quartzite specimens. Two quartzite objects, 139-2
and 4-1 have large spalls removed from the ends of the pieces, suggestive of fracturing
induced by single, extraordinarily hard blows delivered by the stones. The petrified wood
specimens show no obvious battering except for some possible dulling of the surface at
the ends of the objects. Wear at these positions on the stones is consonant with use as
pressure flakers in addition to percussion hammers.

COBBLES

A sample of 17 chert and quartzite cobbles was returned to the lab from 41RT267.
Among the cobbles and cobble fragments, eight have percussion rings indicative of
stream rolling, and 16 have well-rounded cortical surfaces usually attributed to alluvial
transport. These observations provide general information on the sources of chert and
quartzite raw materials in 41RT267 and the upland region. The most likely sources for
these rock types are the stream channels of the Brazos and Navasota rivers, west and east,
respectively of the upland region. Local upland streams such as Big Willow Creek have
sand and mud beds and do not transport gravels. The substrate rock is sandstone with
the local petrified wood as a minor fraction. Therefore, it is likely that the principal rock
types used for tool manufacture, chert and quartzite, were introduced from the river
valleys that flank the uplands.
CORES

Two small chert cores were unearthed from 41RT267, one from Test Pit 16 (138-1)
and one from Backhoe Trench 10 (79-3). Specimen 79-3 is a crude bidirectional core with
irregularly shaped flake scars. Cortex remains on about 40% of the stone's surface.
Specimen 138-1 is multidirectional, flakes having been struck in three directions from
the core. Flake platforms appear not to have been prepared. Step-fracturing on sharp
ridges formed by flake scar edges may indicate expedient use of the core as a tool. Cortex
remains on about 40% of the core.
BIFACES

Twenty chert bifaces were found (Table 4), apart from the defined dart points and
arrow points. Nine of the artifacts were produced by core reduction technology and
eleven are products of flake production technology. This slight imbalance in favor of
flake production mirrors the emphasis on the Late Prehistoric occupations reflected in
the overall artifact assemblage.
The core reduction bifaces are usually categorized by placing them in the sequence
of stages (Patterson 1977; Skelton 1977; Skinner 1972). One specimen, 168-4, falls into
Stage 2, having much cortex and the beginnings of bifacial reduction directed toward
initial shaping and cortex removal. Two specimens, 37-3 and 152-1, qualify as Stage 3
bifaces in having much of the cortex removed and the beginnings of bifacial thinning.
Specimens 29-4, 79-1, and 166-2 have little or no cortex and show the advancement of
the thinning process, traits which mark them as Stage 4 bifaces. Specimens 149-5, 104-1,
and 75-1 are completely thinned and shaped and they have areas of secondary edge
retouch. In all, these Stage 5 bifaces are ready for completion as finished tools.
Al together, the stage bifaces of core reduction technology are biased strongly toward
the finished end of the lithic reduction sequence. This finding is logical for a site lacking
nearby outcrops of raw material. In this setting, workable stone cores were brought to
the site in initially prepared or semifinished states for finishing on the site. This is
consonant with the flaking debitage, which has higher proportions of interior flakes than

those with cortex, the primary and secondary flakes. Most of the cortex on the cores was
removed elsewhere and never brought to the site.
Among the 11 flake production bifaces, only two retain any cortex: specimens 92-1
and 158-2. This may show selection of interior flakes for working into bifaces, or, again,
the transport of semifinished flakes to the site. Two specimens, 129-3 and 154-3, are
fire-spalled and pot-lidded.
Breakage patterns among the bifaces include six (30%) which are usage fractures and
seven (35%) which show manufacturing breaks. The presence of usage breaks on artifacts which are by definition unfinished is to a degree problematic. Perhaps these items
were used expediently before they could be finished and were broken in the process.
GOUGES

One gouge (78-1) and a problematic gouge fragment (45-4) were recovered from the
site. Both are of chert. Specimen 78-1 resembles most closely the Clear Fork type, its
concave bit surface thinned to an edge which is convex in plan outline. Specimen 45-4 is
problematic in that it has no clearly defined bit. Although bifacially worked, it is
reminiscent of a gouge in that one face is relatively flat; the other is thick and high backed.

38 I CALVERT MINE 1992

BIFACIAL KNIFE

One bifacial knife, specimen, 101-1 is roughly flaked on a tablet of poor-quality
petrified wood. Flaking is much heavier on one face than the other, forming an asymmetrical outline in plan view (Fig. 14a). The morphology of this specimen suggests it was
intended for use as a knife. The specimen is incomplete, the probable butt or hafting end
having been snapped off at a possible shear break. The crude flaking has created wide
saw-teeth (maximum length between teeth :1.lcm). Inspection under hand-lens magnification revealed no evidence of use-wear, but it is unlikely that the poor material
faithfully recorded patterns of wear accessible to analysis with magnification.

PROJECTILE POINTS
Dart Points

Five whole or fragmentary dart points were retrieved from the 1992 excavations (Fig.
14; Table 5). These artifacts include Gary (Fig. 14d), Mahomet (Fig. 14i), and Ensor (Fig
14c) dart points. A fragmentary dart point base (Fig. 14e) most closely resembles an
Ensor point, with the exception of its slightly concave base. One dart point tip (Fig. 14b)
cannot be attributed to a named type. The dart points are of chert with the exception of
the Gary point, which is of fine-grained quartzite. Gary points have a long period of use,
but the overall small size of specimen 54-2 associates it with the Late Archaic Period.
The Mahomet and Ensor points are also attributable to the Late Archaic Period (Turner
and Hester 1985:84, 94, 101).
Arrow Points

A total of 14 whole or fragmentary arrow points was found (Table 6). Of these, four
are Scallorn points [two Coryell variants (Fig. 14h,m) and two Sattler variants (Fig. 14g,
l)], two are Alba points (Fig. 14j, k), one is a Granbury point (Fig. 14f), one is untyped
(Fig. 14n), four are fragmentary point tips, and two are point bases, (one of the latter is
a Scallorn point base). The Scallorn points are associated with the early centuries of the
Late Prehistoric period, ca. A.D. 700-1200. The Granbury point, 45-3, is probably a Bono
variety, and is also associated with the earlier portion of the Late Prehistoric period (Jelks
1962:35-36). Both Scallorn and Granbury types are distributed commonly in central and
north-central Texas. The Alba points (19-4 and 21-1) date to about A.D. 800-1200 and
are distributed from South Texas to east and northeast Texas (Turner and Hester
1985:163). The points are typical, Specimen 21-1 differing from Specimen 19-4 in the
lack of the usual serration along the blade edges. The untyped specimen, 85-1, lacks clear
features that would place it with any named type. It is a wide corner-notched specimen
with sub-rounded barbs and an expanding stem. The basal corners are rounded, giving
the entire stem and base a bulbar look.
Dart points and arrow points, by virtue of their differing time periods of production,
permit ready comparisons of the occupations of the site, in this case the Late Archaic and
Late Prehistoric components. The comparison of causes of breakage should allow a
comparative look at the uses of the site as a campsite in the Late Archaic and Late

thus comprise 40% of the total of five whole or fragmentary dart points. One specimen,
65-3, has a shear or usage break; it amounts to 20% of the assemblage. Altogether, 60%
of the dart points have usage breaks of either type. Two other specimens are whole,
forming 40% of the dart points. Among the arrow points, 7, or 50%, of the specimens
have usage breaks. Again, a single specimen has a manufacturing break, comprising 0.8%
of the assemblage. Six arrow points, 43%, are whole.

These proportions are roughly similar, given the differences in the assemblage sizes.
The similarities are surprising also in view of differences in breakage patterns which
might be due to non-functional differences such as the greater thinness of arrow points.
This less durable material quality might be expected to cause greater numbers of usage
and manufacturing breaks as a proportion of the arrow point assemblage. The evenness
of the results suggests similar functions of the camp in both the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric and points to the campsite as a place of maintenance and replacement of
projectile points broken in use.
UTILIZED FLAKES/MODIFIED DEBITAGE

Utilized flakes and modified debitage are terms for lithic tools which may have been
used as tools with minimal or no further preparation after being struck from their cores.
Preparation may be restricted to edge retouch. Tools without retouch are usually identified by edge-wear patterns. The traditional behavioral model applied to explain these
tools is that they are picked up from waste flake scatters for use in tasks not requiring
specialized, curated tools. Hence also the synonym "expedient tools," signifying flakes
used to expedite a task.
Utilized flakes/modified debitage are potentially key artifacts in spatial analysis and
the determination of site function for two reasons. First, utilized flakes may be discarded
as readily as they are picked up, in contexts of deposition very near their contexts of use.
As McGraw (1985:75) explained it:
It is assumed that informal flake tools were discarded in or near the location

that they were used. Therefore, the distributional patterns of modified
debitage may reflect the location of activity areas within the site.
The second reason they are valuable is that they retain clearer evidences of their
functions, either from production or wear, than more formally manufactured tools. This
approach to analysis was explicated by Robinson (1987: 129):
Utilized flakes, or expedient tools, may contribute as a class to inferences
of site function, primarily through study of the intentionality of their
production. This research revolves around the question of the expedient
use of unmodified, unfinished flakes. This debitage might be intentionally
produced for use in unfinished form, a hypothetical situation that would
imply deliberate, specific uses to which these flakes tools were put.
Unintentional production, hence true expedient use, would imply ad hoc
innovation in flake use, and application in imbedded activities for which
advance planning was unnecessary.
Davis and Tomka (1987:140-142) focused tightly on this issue in their test of the
hypothesis that 41RT267 was a hunting camp. Utilized flakes were classed as expedient
tools, or situational gear. Study of the artifacts looked at use-wear to help determine
function, with analysis of context a secondary consideration.
Although researchers agree on the significance of utilized flakes, current research
dealing with this artifact class has not moved toward uniform descriptions, analytic

42 I CALVERT MINE 1992

approaches, or a useful typology. Analysis after description has ranged from none at all
to tests of hypotheses about site functions and settlement hierarchies (Davis et al. 1987).
Utilized flake attributes which have been used for description and analysis in the regional
literature are presented in Table 7. It shows attention to 14 attributes of utilized flakes,
but no agreement on the causes and consequences of attributes.
For use in spatial analysis, functional studies, and settlement pattern research, the
comparative study of utilized flakes is valuable. This value cannot be realized without a
typology which speaks to, or implies, function. Such a functional typology can be constructed from modified debitage attributes which have direct functional implications, and
is attempted here. Of course any typology is only as good as the use to which it is put and
the validity of the classificatory elements which comprise it. The purpose of this typology
is to gain inferences about behavior and site activities, and the attributes which form it
are justified on the basis of their ability to imply function and purpose of tool use. It is
therefore a functional typology. Presumptions about the behavioral/functional attributes
which form the typology are stated as clearly as possible but remain subject to critique,
which is encouraged. It is acknowledged at the outset that the typology will serve its
functional purpose imperfectly and other purposes perhaps not at all. It is however,
useful to have a functional typology which researchers may use, improve, or repudiate.
Along the way research results may be gained, an improvement on the current situation
which lacks an instrument to address a meaningful question in recent research.
Discussion of Functional Attributes

The functional attributes of utilized flakes (Table 8) sort broadly into two functionally
diagnostic categories. The first is features of their production such as edge retouch, and
the second is effects of use, most notably edge-fracturing and wear patterns. Together,
these categories span a spectrum of ideas and behavior. The poles of the spectrum are
intentionality and expediency. The attributes of any utilized flake will position the tool
on that spectrum relative to all the other utilized flakes. The tools can be compared
according to their relative positions on the spectrum, and this information can be applied
to site spatial analysis.
Seven attributes of utilized flakes/modified debitage were abstracted from the literature as traits with moderate to high functional implications. These are discussed below
and listed in Table 9. For the sake of brevity of presentation, the listed traits that lack
functional value are not discussed further.
Flake Shape. Flake shape has functional implications when observing the dichotomy
between flakes and blades. A blade is a specialized flake, requiring more skill in being
struck from a core. It is far more likely to be intentionally produced than merely to
result accidentally from the process of core reduction. Few blades are produced,
therefore, as a proportion of all flakes. This means also that blades are far less available to be picked up from a waste flake scatter, effectively at random for expedient
use in the moment of need. Therefore, as a matter of probability, a utilized flake on a

blade is much more likely to be intentionally produced (have higher intentionality)
than tools on other kinds of flakes.
Blades have many morphological attributes of use to lithic analysts, foremost among
them greater length than width. Parallel lateral edges and dorsal ridges are important
diagnostics too. The sole blade criterion used here is a length-to-width ratio of 2.5: 1 or
higher. This simple definition facilitates comparisons with other published reports in
which ratios may be calculated even if blade tools were not recognized.
Platform Preparation. A prepared platform is more likely to imply intentional
production for use as a tool than unprepared or cortical platforms. This is a question
of probability but suggests a vector which may be strengthened by other attributes.
Number of Modified Edges. Modified edges of course define an item of debitage as a
tool, but the number of worked edges on a single flake comments further on the use of

41RT267 I 47

the tool. A single modified edge length may have been prepared or used once but multiple modified edges imply several episodes of use, longer duration, greater intensity,
or a combination of these. Higher values of any of these functional variables increase
the likelihood of intentional preparation of the needed tool and correspondingly
decrease the likelihood that a truly expedient tool would satisfy the needs of the task.
'fype of Edge Modification. Edge modification may be intentional retouch, usually
pressure flaking, or fracturing and flaking resulting from use. This functional attribute
neatly straddles the broad functionally diagnostic categories. Edge retouch is a feature of production. It may amount to no more than a refurbishing of a dulled edge and
require a few pressure strokes and seconds of time. This activity is nevertheless an act
of intentional production defined strictly. In contrast, the irregular flaking and spalling resulting from application to the worked surface is entirely an effect of use.
So-called utilized, "nibbled," or "nicked" edges imply no intentionality whatever and
are the hallmark of expedient use.
Modification Edge Length. The length of a modified edge may indicate the duration
of use of a tool, or the amount of preparation prior to use of the tool. Edge length
may also record the average width of materials scraped or cut. The functional value of
this variable is marginal, but, again, it is suggestive. Black (1986:55) used modified
edge length primarily to define modified debitage as tools as opposed to naturally
edge-damaged flakes.
Modified Edge Shape. The shape of a modified edge may be the result of preparation,
use, or the combination of the two. An unprepared and worn edge may be refurbished
by retouch and this cycle may be repeated several times. The result, with continuing
use, is a tendency toward a concave edge. Bailey, Fields, and Lisk (1986:253-258) included as attributes straight, convex, concave, and irregular edges. These attributes
are adopted for use here, with the exception of irregular. Irregular shapes may be
thought of as combinations of the other shapes, and they also tend to be longer edges
in order to manifest any change in trend. This attribute is termed multiple here.
Use-Wear. Potentially the most important indicator of function, wear patterns on flake
edges are the effects of use. Tomka (Davis et. al 1987: 141) conducted replicative experiments to identify types of action, specifically cutting and scraping, which should
produce given wear patterns. Scraping, after about 450 scrapes on wood, created patterned flake scars on one face of the flake and some rounding of the edge. Cutting
produced small flake scars on both faces and less rounding, again after 450 repetitions
on wood. Bement (1984:72) also accepted bifacial chipping as a diagnostic of cutting
action.

A high magnification survey of Bement's (1984:72) study sample detected no wear
patterns suggestive of materials worked, such as wood, bone, or hide. This finding

48 I CALVERT MINE 1992

confirmed his (Bement 1984:71-72) theorizing that the tools were used only for short
periods before discard. This short use period did not allow enough time for diagnostic
polishes, striations, or other patterns to develop.
Methodology

Analysis of the utilized flakes/modified debitage consisted in determining the functional attributes of the artifacts and comparing them. Analysis of their contexts enters
the overall site spatial analysis, and they also are used in comparisons with regional sites.
The practical construction of the typology proceeded in a systematic manner. The
first task was to distinguish actual utilized flakes from naturally edge-damaged flakes, a
critical need in functional studies (Black personal communication, 1992). This distinction was made by examining a sample of unmodified debitage under the microscope to
gain a visual comparison of the effects of natural edge-damage and cultural use. Of aid,
too, was the establishment of a minimum length of edge modification, 2 mm, under which
threshold all effects were assumed natural and therefore excluded from analysis (Black
1986:54-55).
All the utilized flakes were examined with a binocular microscope to ascertain their
attributes accurately. The establishment offunction scores is a way to quantify essentially
qualitative relationships. Within each category, numerical points were given to each
attribute. Lower points or zeros were given to traits indicating expediency, higher points
to traits suggesting intentionality of production and use. Table 9 lists the points assigned
to each attribute. Each utilized flake has a function score computed by the addition of
the points for each of the functional attributes possessed by the artifact. Lower scores
indicate expediency higher scores intentionality.
The means of the function scores were calculated for those associated with the Late
Prehistoric occupation zone and those associated with the Late Archaic zone, with the
intent of comparing the functions of the living floors. The function scores are essentially
ranks along a continuum from expediency on the lower end to intentionality on the
higher. Although the sample sizes are disparate, the mean function score for specimens
associated with the Late Prehistoric occupation (mean= 4.46, n = 30) differs significantly
from that of the Late Archaic levels (mean= 3.0, n = 6), suggesting that a viable distinction between the two can be made.
DEBITAGE

Lithic debitage, the stone flakes and chips produced by stone toolmaking, was found
in varying amounts in all the site areas. Table 10 presents the distribution of lithic
debitage in the test pits, backhoe trenches, feature fill, Shovel Probe 2, and Shovel Probe
3. The classification presented is the near-standard flake typology based on the presence
and decreasing amount of cortex on the dorsal faces of flakes: primary, secondary, and
tertiary. In terms of stone cores and knapping, primary flakes derive from the outside,
cortex-covered surface of a stone cobble, and tertiary flakes are material from the interior
of the core. Behaviorally, primary flakes tend to result from testing and initial preparation of cores, either for core reduction or flake production. Tertiary flakes imply shaping,

thinning, and finishing of tools, the latter stages of the manufacturing process. An
additional category in the analysis is the chip, defined as non-flake-shaped pieces shattered from cores during the chipping process and flake bits too fragmentary to classify by
type.
The stone flaking assemblage is overwhelmingly chert with a minor fraction of
quartzite. The distribution of debitage is, along with burned rock, an index for definition
of the cultural zones of the site (Table 10). The table shows a preponderance of debitage
of all types in the Late Prehistoric zone, levels 3 through 5, and in some pits Level 6.
Below the Late Prehistoric zone, flakes gradually decline in number. In the Late Archaic
zone, exposed in test pits 17 through 20, flake counts increase slightly or stabilize. Counts
then decline sharply downward to the culturally sterile levels below the site.
Throughout the site and the excavation levels, tertiary flakes are the dominant type,
followed by secondary flakes. In some levels with generally low flake counts, primary
flakes are lacking. This bias toward finishing flakes is strong, and suggests that the site
was a place for tool finishing and repair rather than testing and initial preparation of
cores. This finding serves for both the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric cultural zones.
The interpretation is intuitive in that there are no nearby chert or quartzite deposits. All
chert and quartzite cores or tools would have to be transported to the site. Testing and
preparation of cores elsewhere would significantly reduce transport loads, and this
behavior would bias the resulting debitage assemblage toward tertiary flakes. It should
be noted here that interpretations based on this flake typology are limited, in that the
nature of stone cores and the processes of aboriginal flintknapping almost invariably
favor tertiary flakes as a manufacturing byproduct, both by number and weight. Thus
interpretations based solely on flake typology must remain somewhat generalized.
Ceramics

A single potsherd of a grog-tempered plainware was recovered from the site from
Level 4 in Test Pit 29. The interior surface is yellowish-red (SYRS/6), the exterior brown
(7.SYRS/4). The core is black to very dark gray (5YR2.5/1 and 5YR3/1). The surface
contours suggest manufacture by the paddle and anvil technique, and both the interior
and exterior were well-smoothed but not polished. The core texture is rough. The
ceramic fabric has small sand particles in addition to the crushed sherds (grog) which
tempered it. The grog also contains small sand particles.
Grog tempering is a trait shared with the sherd from 41RT288 and gives the pottery
affinities with East Texas Caddoan pottery. The Big Willow Creek ceramic piece lacks
the rodlike voids and other features of the ceramic paste found in the 41RT288 potsherd.
The potsherds from both the sites are similar to Specimen 3 from the Big Willow Creek
Site, excavated in 1986 (Davis et al. 1987:161), the only grog-tempered sherd recovered
in those excavations.
Historic Artifacts

A rusted piece of barbed wire, 17 cm long, was excavated from the site, from Level 1
of Test Pit 13. The wire is the sole historic artifact from the 1992 excavations of the Big

Willow Creek Site. It was in correct stratigraphic position to mark the use of the site as
part of a pasture on the Hailey property in modern times.
Eco facts

MACROFLORAL

Nine hackberry seeds were unearthed from the Big Willow Creek Site from depths as
much as 30 cm below surface. None of the seeds were charred, and their generally
shallow distribution is likely due to modern mixing into the sandy soil. It is unlikely that
the uncharred seeds are actual examples of prehistoric use of hackberry.
FAUNAL

Three faunal specimens were recovered from the site, a small mammal vertebra
(probably a rodent), a large mammal long bone fragment, and a specimen of tooth
enamel. The tooth enamel, 96-1 is from an indeterminate species. The mammal long
bone fragment, 47-1, may be a deer bone, but this cannot be demonstrated. The heavily
eroded fragment is near an articular end. The total length of the specimen is 52.7 mm.
The cortex is almost entirely worn away but several rodent gnawing marks and possible
butchering marks remain. The butchering marks run at a diagonal to the long axis of the
bone, about 19 mm from the articular end.
CHRONOLOGY

The chronology of the prehistoric occupations of the Big Willow Creek Site is based
principally on radiocarbon dating and diagnostic artifacts, with a minor contribution from
thermoluminescence dating. As Davis et al. (1987) established, the site has Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric components. Their dating was based on temporally diagnostic
artifacts and a single thermoluminescence assay of 1350 B.P.Â±160 (Alpha 3052) taken
from a sandstone rock in Feature 3. This date is at the approximate beginning of the Late
Prehistoric period, or the end of the Terminal Archaic period. Their Late Prehistoric
diagnostic artifacts amounted to two Alba arrow points, three Scallorn arrow points, a
Steiner arrow point, and a Perdiz arrow point. The Late Archaic component was dated
on the basis of a Waco Sinker, one Yarborough and two Gary dart points.
The 1992 excavations at the Big Willow Creek Site confirmed the multicomponent
nature of the site. Additional Late Prehistoric diagnostics included four Scallorn arrow
points, two Alba arrow points, and a Granbury arrow point. All of these diagnostics are
commonly believed to date from about A.D. 700 to 1200 and slightly later (Turner and
Hester 1985). Three Late Archaic diagnostics were a Gary dart point, a Mahomet dart
point, and an Ensor dart point; these artifacts date generally between 300 B.C. and A.D.
700 (Turner and Hester 1985).
In order to gain a more precise chronology of the site and its intact cultural contexts,
radiocarbon samples were taken for dating of soil organics. Two such samples, taken from
immediately beneath the hearth stones of Features 6 and 7, were submitted to the
Radiocarbon Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, for assay. Both samples
successfully returned assays. The sample from beneath Feature 6 dated to 530 years B.P.

41RT267 I 53

Â±60 uncorrected (TX-7674; 540 years B.P. Â±60 corrected). The sample from beneath
Feature 7 yielded a date of 660 years B.P. Â±70 uncorrected (TX-7675; 670 years B.P. Â±70
corrected). Both samples had identical stable carbon isotope ratios (c5 13 C) of -24.7 ppm.
The radiocarbon years calibrate to the range between A.D. 1325 and 1430 (TX- 7674)
and A.D. 1280 to 1410 (TX-7675; Stuiver and Reimer 1987), both well within the Late
Prehistoric Period. These radiocarbon dates are significantly later than the thermoluminescence assay gained from Feature 3. Although the thermoluminescence
method has recently come under fire, the most reasonable inference from this disparity
is that features 6 and 7, which have morphological differences with Feature 3, were also
formed in later occupations of the site. Their dating is also slightly later than the
conventional dating of the other Late Prehistoric diagnostics of the site, a disjunction
which may not be mathematically significant (on the other hand, the diagnostic artifacts
may have been used later than dated heretofore, and the Big Willow Creek Site radiocarbon assays may provide a useful adjustment of their dates).
All in all, the chronology of the Big Willow Creek Site, updated with advances in the
radiocarbon method, seats the upper component securely in the Late Prehistoric period.
The lower component, stratigraphically lower and temporally earlier than the upper
component, remains attributed to the Late Archaic period on the basis of index artifacts.
The chronology establishes a temporal setting of the site in the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods, and it indicates that the site's burned rock features, at least in the
Late Prehistoric period, were formed sequentially, probably by reoccupations of the site
over long periods of time.
SPATIAL ANALYSIS

The burned rock features of 41RT267 and their distributions are the remains of a
hunter-gatherer camp dating to the Late Prehistoric period (Fig. 15). Spatial analysis of
these features and their relationships, considered as the results and remains of human
behavior, should provide more specific information about Late Prehistoric aboriginal
occupation and use of the Brazos uplands. Appropriate models for spatial analysis are
found in the ethnoarcheology and social anthropology of hunter-gatherers. Brooks and
Yellen (1987:68-69) have ordered the levels of archeological visibility of hunter-gatherer
behavior on the basis of behavioral redundancy at sites. Their research is built on
ethnoarcheology of South African Bushmen. Based on it, Brooks and Yellen (1987:69)
offered the useful distinction between reuse and reoccupation. Reuse is the repeated
use, in the same way, of a feature, such as a hearth, or an area, such as a dumping ground.
Reoccupation is the general return to a site without repeated or congruent use of features
such as hearths, dumping areas, or huts for specific purposes.
Brooks' and Yellen's (1987:75-77) ethnoarcheological research showed a strong pattern of reuse at sites with limited and specific functions, such as hunting blinds at
waterholes. Needs for recycling of materials, resource depletion, and avoidance of
contaminants mitigate against reuse of features at domestic base camps. Such larger and
functionally complex and generalized sites usually are reoccupations of general locales.
Further, larger populations at base camps and longer periods of occupation serve to
disrupt and obscure features such as flintknapping ateliers (Brooks and Yellen 1987:8090).

The spatial analysis of the Big Willow Creek site consists of examining the features
and occupation floors for relative reuse or reoccupation. The value or validity of applying
the Brooks and Yellen model of identifying site function on the basis of reuse or
reoccupation lies beyond the scope of testing at this single site. The model's application
to Texas prehistory, with its significant differences with South African Bushman environment and culture, should proceed with caution and acknowledgement of those
differences. It is applied here as a fresh approach and one in parallel with the earlier
interpretive theoretical background used by Davis et al. (1987) in their testing of the site.
Assessment of the intactness and reuse of the Late Prehistoric features (there were
no discrete Late Archaic features) is the primary technique of the spatial analysis.
Consistent sets of artifacts in proximity may also suggest the intactness of living floors
near the features. Distributions of burned rock may provide an index of disruption of
features.
The Late Prehistoric burned rock features displayed conflicting features of intactness
or disruption (Fig. 15a). Feature 3 showed the clearest trend of any of the features with
its stacked rocks, intentional shaping or construction, and many rocks fire-fractured in
place. These characteristics suggest reuse in the form of multiple firings in a hearth
maintained for continuing use.
Feature 4 was the largest identified feature on the site, but effectively shapeless and
surrounded by scattered rocks. These aspects imply both informality of preparation and
disruption after use. On the other hand, there were several piles of stacked rock in and
around the hearth, and numerous stones fire-cracked in place. These bespeak multiple
firings and at least a degree of integrity of the feature. Perhaps the best explanation for
the hearth is that it described a space for firings of an unprepared type of hearth which
required piles of rock.
Features 6 and 7 were very similar in dimensions, configuration, and materials. Both
were relatively small, had numerous in-place fractures, but about half their rocks were
scattered. Multiple firings of these features cannot be established on this evidence. Of
note regarding features 6 and 7 is their proximity, approximately 30 cm. Contemporary
use of the hearths would not have been practical. Indeed, radiocarbon dating of the
features showed that they were disjunct in time. These findings imply reoccupation of
this portion of the site, where similar features were constructed with each new occupation. Feature 8 showed formal shaping and stacked stones which imply care and reuse of
the hearth, but there was also wide scattering of burned rock from the hearth. This
disruption may have taken place after the final use of the feature.
Distributions of burned rock apart from the discrete features showed only a small
degree of patterning. In Excavation Block A (Fig. 15a), the loose burned rock appeared
to be randomly scattered around features 6 and 7, up to a few centimeters of them. Near
Feature 3, however, the nearest burned rock large enough to be mapped was at least 50
centimeters from the feature. Although the Late Prehistoric occupation level was not
excavated and cleared for large distances around the hearth, this virtual absence of rock
debris suggests cleaning and maintenance of the space around Feature 3. This observation and the formally constructed and maintained nature of Feature 3 raise the possibility

41RT267 I 57

that the burned rock hearth was built and used inside a small hut. Postmolds or other
remains of hut construction have not been found, and this suggestion must remain
speculative. Feature 8, located downhill south of Excavation Block A, was also positioned
within a space apparently devoid of debris burned rock save for that obviously scattered
from the feature itself. Its setting gives it additional similarities in function with Feature
3, prior to its disruption.
Burned rock in the Late Prehistoric levels of Excavation Block B (Fig. 15b) appeared
to be randomly distributed and lacking in associations with discrete artifact sets.
Likewise, the burned rock in the lower, Late Archaic occupation level (Fig. 16) appeared
to be scatter from undiscovered or destroyed features or constructions.

Artifact sets in proximity to the features suggest minor functional differences among
the burned rock hearths. Feature 3 had five discrete artifacts, four utilized flakes and an
untyped arrow point mid-section. Feature 4, the large hearth showing evidence of
multiple firings but little formality of construction, had a utilized flake, a biface fragment,
and at least five large petrified wood hammerstones or cobbles. Features 6 and 7, the
most similar hearths morphologically, also had the same artifact types near them. Feature 6 had a biface fragment, an untyped projectile point base, a hammerstone, and one
utilized flake. Feature 7 had two biface fragments, one untyped projectile point tip, a
hammerstone, and three utilized flakes. Feature 8 had a single utilized flake near it.
Altogether, the artifacts around features 3, 6, 7, and 8 indicate activities and behavior
benefiting possibly from the light and warmth provided by a fire. The utilized flakes
imply working various types of material, and the broken projectile point fragments
suggest refurbishing of projectiles. The numerous hammerstones around Feature 4
suggest processing of materials in association with heating in the hearth. Bones are one
likely material which may have been processed. The lack of chert lithic debitage near
the feature suggests that chert heat treatment was not a likely function of Feature 4 and
its hammerstones.

Special Studies
In order to gain insights into 41RT267 beyond those feasible by usual analytical
methods, additional studies were performed in three areas: heating analysis of Simsboro
sandstone, pollen analysis, and geomorphic analysis. Sandstone refiring experiments
were performed in the laboratory at TARL. Pollen samples were analyzed by Linda Scott
Cummings of PaleoResearch, Inc., of Denver, Colorado. The geomorphic analysis was
conducted by S. Christopher Caran of Austin, Texas, incorporating the results of tests
performed on soil samples by the Soils Laboratory, Texas A&M University.
SIMSBORO SANDSTONE HEATING ANALYSIS

The sandstone in the burned rock features at 41RT267 contrasts with raw material
collected from nearby outcrops of the Eocene-age Simsboro formation, a few tens of
meters away at most. The principal difference between fired and unfired sandstone is
color; the fired hearth stones were commonly a deep brick-red while the natural rock is
a variety of brown, dark brown, yellowish-brown, light tan and yellow colors. These
differences suggested that the range of.temperatures achieved in the aboriginal hearths
could be determined by controlled heating of a sample of unfired sandstone rocks through
documented incremental firings.
Design Of Experiment

Twelve Simsboro sandstone slabs were cleaned of adhering dust and soil. Each rock
was engraved with an identifying number from one to twelve. Munsell color chart
readings of the natural color of the unfired stone were taken in natural light under open
shade. Individual rocks were multi-colored, shading from dark brown to light yellow. To

------------- - -

41RT267 I 59

avoid recording variation by location rather than heating temperature, every color
reading was taken on the engraved number or within 2 cm of it. The surface texture
variability, such as cracking, crazing, or spalling, was also noted. Subtler changes, such
as shrinkage, were anticipated by breaking the rock, and reserving a part for refitting after
firing. The broken, unfired pieces also served as a visual reference for comparison of
color and surface texture changes.
Firing was by 50Â° Celsius increments in a three-band electric ceramic kiln. An
oxidizing atmosphere was maintained by leaving observation ports open for circulation.
Temperature was recorded by a pyrometer inserted into the middle band of the kiln,
approximately 5 cm above the tray on which the sandstone slabs were placed.
Results

Firings of the Simsboro sandstone showed progressive changes in color beginning
oberservably at 275Â° and becoming distinct at 300Â°. Firing to 500Â°, the hottest temperature achieved in the firing process, produced no clean surface textural changes textural
changes except a slight crazing of a thin surface crust of sand, adhering to someof the
stones. The most dramatic color changes were apparent in the study collection when the
slabs were accidently fired through the 300Â° increment to 350Â° . To compensate for this
error and precisely define the temperature range in which heating effects become
apparent, a second test batch of stones was prepared and fired by 25Â° increments through
the range 250Â° to 350Â°. In this second firing program, the first minute changes were
recorded on four out of fifteen stones at 275Â°. At 300Â°, all except one stone showed
dramatic color change. That stone had already changed color at 275Â°, and showed no
further reaction to firing.
The general pattern was for the Simsboro sandstone to change color dramatically at
300Â° and then remain stable at higher temperatures. The highest temperature attained
was 500Â°; Slabs fired to that temperature showed only minor (one color chip) chroma
and value changes to darker values (sometimes one or two hue pages) after their initial
major reaction, between 300Â° and 350Â°. It is apparent from this experiment that the
iron-rich minerals in Simsboro sandstone respond most dramatically to heating at about
300Â°, after which moderate heating to higher temperatures has little effect.
The colors of the aboriginally-fired burned rock features compared favorably with the
experimentally-fired slabs. The rock in Feature 4 seemed generally darker brick-red than
that in the other features, an observation that might imply that Feature 4 was fired to
higher temperatures. The general conclusion of the experiment is that all the burned
rock features were fired through 300Â°, the threshold temperature of heat-induced
mineralogical changes manifested by dramatic color changes to various reddish hues.
Furthermore, surface effects such as crazing and spalling were not observed at all in the
firing program. At 500Â°, a small ryme or crust of possibly vitrified material was observed
on a few of the test slabs; however, it cannot be confirmed that this material is a product
of firing. It may be a previously unobserved coating of material which became visible
when the rock surface changed color beneath it. In general, the feature rocks showed no
surface effects of firing as well. The sandstone pieces broken from the slabs before firing

still matched perfectly along their fracture lines, demonstrating that sandstone of this
type does not shrink with advanced heating.
POLLEN ANALYSIS
LINDA SCOTT CUMMINGS

Two pollen samples, from a stratigraphic column at 41RT267 and representing distinct
cultural zones, were examined. These samples represent a Late Prehistoric occupation
(post-900 A.D.) and a Late Archaic occupation (500 B.C.-A.D. 900). Pollen analysis was
conducted on these two samples to determine whether full-scale investigation of the
stratigraphic column is justified.
Methods

A chemical extraction technique based on flotation is the standard preparation
technique used in this laboratory for the removal of the pollen from the large volume of
sand, silt, and clay with which they are mixed. This particular process was developed for
extraction of pollen from soils where preservation has been less than ideal and pollen
density is low.
Hydrochloric acid (10%) was used to remove calcium carbonates present in the soil,
after which the samples were screened through 150 micron mesh. The samples were
rinsed until neutral by adding water, letting the samples stand for 2-4 hours, then pouring
off the supernatant. A small quantity of sodium hexametaphosphate was added to each
sample once it reached neutrality, then the beaker was again filled with water and allowed
to stand for 2-4 hours. The samples were again rinsed until neutral, filling the beakers
only with water. This step was added to remove clay prior to heavy liquid separation.
Zinc bromide (density 2.0) was used for the flotation process. The samples were mixed
with zinc bromide while still moist, immediately after centrifugation to remove the dilute
hydrochloric acid and water. All samples received a short (10 minute) treatment in hot
hydrofluoric acid to remove any remaining inorganic particles. The samples were then
acetolated for 3 minutes to remove any extraneous organic matter.
A light microscope was used to count the pollen to a total of 100 to 200 pollen grains
at a magnification of 500x. Pollen preservation in these samples varied from good to
poor. Comparative reference material collected at the Intermountain Herbarium at
Utah State University and the University of Colorado Herbarium was used to identify
the pollen to the family, genus, and species level, where possible. Pollen aggregates were
recorded during identification of the pollen. Aggregates are clumps of a single type of
pollen, and may be interpreted to represent pollen dispersal over short distances, or the
actual introduction of portions of the plant represented into an archeological setting.
Aggregates were included in the pollen counts as single grains, as is customary. The
presence of aggregates is noted by an asterisk (*) next to the pollen frequency on the
pollen table.
Indeterminate pollen includes pollen grains that are folded, mutilated, and otherwise
distorted beyond recognition. These grains are included in the total pollen count, as they
are part of the pollen record.

Discussion

Site 41RT267 is located in the Post Oak Savanna in an area where post oak (Quercus
stellata), juniper (Juniperus), and hackberry (Celtis) are the dominant elements of the
modern vegetation. A dense understory includes greenvine, poison ivy (Rhus
toxicodendron), poison oak (Rhus toxicodendron), and blackberry (Rubus) vines. Nearby pastures support various cultivated grasses and wild flowers. Big Willow Creek,
located approximately one km from this site, is flanked by dense riparian growth
dominated by live oaks (Quercus virginiana) and including pecan (Juglans) and cottonwood (Populus).
Sample 11 was collected from a Late Prehistoric zone (post-900A.D.) at a depth of 45
cm (Table 11 ). Approximately 50% of the pollen within this sample could not be
identified due to degradation of the pollen grains. The remainder of the pollen observed
include Juniperus, Pinus, Quercus, Cheno-ams, Artemisia, High-spine Compositae,
Gramineae, Rosaceae, and Umbelliferae (Table 12). A small quantity of Gramineae-type
starch was also recorded. Dominance of the pollen record by Quercus pollen is consistent
with post oak forest in this area at the time of Late Prehistoric occupation.
Sample 4 was collected at a depth of 115 cm and represents the Late Archaic (5 00
B.C.-A.D.900) occupation. This pollen sample did not yield a sufficient quantity of pollen
for analysis. The few types recovered include Quercus, High-spine Compositae, and
Umbelliferae. The percentage of Indeterminate or poorly preserved pollen was similar
to that in sample 11. Pollen density in these samples was relatively low, probably
reflecting destruction of the majority of pollen originally present in these sediments.
Summary And Conclusions

The analysis of two samples representing the Late Prehistoric and Late Archaic
occupations at 41RT267 yielded pollen of relatively low density and poor preservation.
It is unlikely that further analysis of stratigraphic samples from this site would yield
sufficient pollen data for an accurate reconstruction of the paleoenvironment or local
vegetation. Therefore, no further analysis is recommended.

GEOMORPHOLOGY AND QUATERNARY STRATIGRAPHY
S. CHRISTOPHER CARAN

.

Both 41RT267 and 41RT288 occupy low hills and hill slopes within the watershed of
Walnut Creek, a major intermittent tributary of Little Brazos River. Artifactual remains
were recovered from the surface of a moderately well-developed buried soil and from
thick sandy deposits covering this soil, which is partly truncated. The present report
describes the general geomorphology of 41RT267 as well as the stratigraphy of cultural
and noncultural sedimentary deposits at both sites. Particular attention focuses on the

41RT267 I 63

accumulation and possible redistribution of sediment in relation to the original
anthropogenic provenience of cultural materials.
Location And Geomorphic Setting

The two archeological sites occupy wooded slopes above tributaries of Walnut Creek,
which flows into the upper Little Brazos River approximately 13.4 km southwest of these
sites. The Little Brazos River, in turn, is part of the Brazos River network draining into
the Gulf of Mexico 280 km southeast of the current testing area (Geological Survey 1985).
This area lies within the western or inner portion of the West Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic province (Fenneman 1946), specifically in that part known as the Claypan
Land-resource Area (Soil Conservation Service 1985: 52) or Post Oak Belt (Ferguson
1986). Climate of the testing area is humid subtropical with mild winters and hot
summers (Bomar in press). At Franklin, the county seat of Robertson County, mean
annual temperature is 20Â° C and mean annual precipitation is 997 mm (Griffiths and
Bryan 1987:421).
Geomorphic investigations focused on processes affecting the provenience of cultural
materials at upland sites. Elevation of the hill slope at 41RT267 ranges from 119 to 123
m. (Geological Survey 1978). Willow Creek, a tributary of Walnut Creek, has incised
more than 21 m below the hill crest, producing a 9% northeast-facing slope grading into
the adjacent narrow flood plain.
Near-surface stratigraphy at these sites is similar. Both sections are bedded and
horizonated and were exposed to depths of one to two meters. The sections consist of
silty sand overlying pebbley to cobbley sand, with weakly- to moderately well-developed
soils and buried soils. The coarsest sediment is a relict fluvial-channel deposit derived
in part from local bedrock, which is not exposed at either site. Bedrock in the testing
area is sandstone of the Eocene Calvert Bluff Formation, uppermost Wilcox Group
(Proctor et al. 1970). Low concentrations of cultural materials were found in slope-wash
deposits throughout the upper parts of these sections. Intact burned-rock features and
a somewhat higher concentration of artifacts were recovered from the surface of a buried
soil at 41RT267. Post-burial bioturbation was an important factor affecting the distribution of cultural remains and sediment at both sites.
Previous Investigations
ENVIRONMENT

Few published references pertain directly to the environment of the testing area.
Mandel and Caran (in press) provided an introduction to the physical, biological, and
cultural resources of the inner Gulf Coastal Plain of Central and South Texas, extending
just south of Robertson County. This region (but not necessarily sites 41RT267 and
41RT288) appears to have been occupied continuously from the Paleoindian period to
the present (Fields et al. 1986). During the current investigation, Late Archaic through
Late Prehistoric lithic materials were recovered from both coherent and mixed
stratigraphic contexts. Two radiocarbon assays supplement the age control afforded by
cultural chronology. The presence of cultural resources at these sites had been recognized during previous surveys.

64 I CALVERT MINE 1992

Numerous investigators have treated aspects of the regional environment. A standard
soil survey of Robertson County is currently in preparation, but is not yet available.
Regional hydrology, including surface-and ground-water resources, was summarized by
Cronin et al. (1963), Rawson (1967), and Buckner and Shelby (1991a, b). Discussions of
high-magnitude, high-frequency flooding of streams in Central Texas by Baker (1975) and
Caran and Baker (1986) are partly applicable to the present testing area, as well.
Regional climatic data were summarized by Orton (1969), Griffiths and Ainsworth
(1981), Larkin and Bomar (1983), Griffiths and Bryan (1987), and Bomar (in press).
Drought was discussed by Riggio et al. (1987).
Pre-Quaternary geology of Robertson County and vicinity was described and/or
mapped by Hill (1901), Waters et al. (1955), and Proctor et al. (1970). Hoeman et al.
(1945), Plummer (1945), Pence (1951), and Kaiser et al. (1980) treated economically
important mineral resources of Robertson County, particularly sand and gravel, peat,
ceramic clays, and lignite.
QUATERNARY STRATIGRAPHY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

For purposes of this discussion, the Quaternary Period is the interval from 1.64 million
years ago to the present, including the Pleistocene Epoch, 1,640,000 to 10,000 years
before present (yr B.P.), and the Holocene Epoch, 10,000 yr B.P. to the present (Harland
et al. 1990:Fig. 1.7). Harland et al. (1990:68-69), and the present author, favor the
following division of the Pleistocene Epoch: Early, 1,640,000 to 788,000 yr B.P.; Middle,
788,000 to 132,000 yr B.P.; and Late, 132,000 to 10,000 yr B.P. The Holocene Epoch is
here informally divided into three equal time intervals, "early," "middle," and "late," and
the "modern" period roughly corresponding to the present century. Known human
occupation of the Inner Gulf Coastal Plains and adjacent areas spans the past 11,000 years
(Hester 1986). The present geomorphic and stratigraphic assessment emphasizes the
period of occupation, but data concerning pre-Holocene geology are presented as appropriate.
Several studies have touched on aspects of the Quaternary geology of this area.
Proctor et al. (1970) mapped modern fluvial channel and terrace deposits, as well as older
(Tertiary) bedrock units, in northern Robertson County, including the archeological
testing area at the Walnut Creek Mine. Despite this contribution, the stratigraphy and
chronology of Quaternary deposits in this region remain poorly known. Mandel and
Caran (in press) provided a stratigraphic, chronologic, and paleoenvironmental overview
of fluvial systems throughout the inner Gulf Coastal Plains of Central and South Texas.
This investigation largely excluded the Brazos River basin, however, instead emphasizing
the Colorado River basin to the south.
Investigators who have described Quaternary deposits and geomorphic features
through much of the Brazos River basin on the Gulf Coastal Plain include Bernard et al.
(1970), Epps (1973), and Henry and Basciano (1979). Although these studies identify
major landscape processes in the region, most are hampered by limited chronologic
control. Heinrich ( 1986) discussed the geomorphology of upland archeological sites at
the Jewett Lignite Mine in Leon County, immediately northeast of Robertson County.
This study was supported by cultural and radiocarbon-age control. Published studies

41RT267 I 65

covering other parts of the western Coastal Plain have produced a small number of
radiocarbon assays and tephrochronologic, cultural, or biostratigraphic evidence useful
in establishing regional chronologies. Blum (1992) described Holocene and Late Pleistocene deposits of the Colorado River flood plain and lower terraces and presented a
suite of radiocarbon assays. Izett and Wilcox (1982) reported an occurrence (their map
locality Texas 2) of 620,000 year old Lava Creek B volcanic ash in Bastrop County, Texas,
in the Colorado River valley (see also Izett 1981). Caran and Mandel (1988) and Mandel
and Caran (in press) related this Middle Pleistocene ash deposit to one of the upper
terraces of the Colorado. The ash provides the only "absolute" age datum beyond the
range of radiocarbon assays for any Quaternary deposit or landform in the Gulf Coastal
Plain.
Fields et al. (1986), Bryant and Shafer (1977), Bryant and Holloway (1985), and
Lundelius (1991, in press) enumerated important archeological, palynological, and
paleontological sites and ascertained the temporal context of recovered cultural, floral,
and faunal materials. No post-Miocene faunas older than Rancholabrean (Middle to
Late Pleistocene) have been found in the Gulf Coastal Plain west of Florida; however,
an extensive Early Pleistocene Irvingtonian fauna was recently discovered in caves along
the Balcones Escarpment, which borders the Coastal Plain on the west (Taylor 1982;
Holman and Winkler 1987). Rancholabrean and Holocene faunas are known from a
number of sites in the inner Gulf Coastal Plain (Lundelius in press).
A few Quaternary palynological records have also been established in the region from
stratigraphic sequences in East-Central Texas (Bryant and Holloway 1985:61, Fig. 1,
Table 1). Some archeological sites have yielded limited paleontological and/or
palynological records, as well, and the occupational histories of known archeological sites
in the region span the Late Pleistocene to the present. Although it is clear that appropriate indicators of regional Quaternary paleoenvironment exist at various localities,
no one has yet fully integrated the available, albeit diverse, regional data base.
Geomorphology And Stratigraphy

Stratigraphy and geomorphology of the recently tested archeological sites at Walnut
Creek Mine provide indications of pre-modern environmental conditions and the
chronology of late Quaternary landscape evolution. Environmental factors may have
strongly influenced occupation of this area, as well as subsequent preservation and
integrity of the sites and cultural materials. The variety, intensity, and continuity of
human activities were controlled, directly or indirectly, by proximity to water and the
associated riparian plant and animal communities. Properties of the substrate also were
important. Soils at both sites supported (and continue to support) deciduous woodlands,
which may have provided an important resource base for prehistoric land use. Woody
vegetation may disturb buried archeological materials, however, through root penetration, tree throw, and other effects. The current project area has supported grazing, tree
cutting, and limited tillage agriculture, which may derange surficial strata and any cultural
materials they may contain. Land use can affect local erosion and sedimentation, as well.
Erosion, sedimentation, and other geomorphic processes may potentially sustain or
diminish the archeological record in many ways. Redistribution of sediment results from

----~

--------------

66 I CALVERT MINE 1992

a variety of hill-slope processes, which may disperse cultural materials or bury them soon
after their creation, thereby destroying or protecting the archeological resource. Even
after burial, artifacts and features can be redistributed by gradual denudation or by
bioturbation. Artifacts freed by erosion may be transported and redeposited out of their
original anthropogenic context; but exposure also promotes discovery of materials during
archeological surveys. Sediment and artifacts may become mixed through pedogenic
activities such as bioturbation, which would tend to reduce stratigraphic continuity in
parts of the landscape and to disrupt the integrity of buried features, cultural horizons,
and activity surfaces. In this way, Paleoindian through historic artifacts could become
randomly commingled through several meters of homogenized sediment. It is clear that
favorable circumstances are required to preserve intact the cultural record of a given site.
Geomorphic studies involved only limited field investigations. Numerous backhoe
trenches and test pits were excavated in order to determine the horizontal boundaries of
each site and the vertical distribution of cultural materials. These excavations also
allowed assessment of site stratigraphy and geomorphic history. Preliminary findings
were then compared with the findings of previous geomorphic investigations in comparable settings within the Inner Gulf Coastal Plain.
Site Characteristics

The current archeological testing area encompasses a limited suite of geomorphic
terrains defined on the basis of surface morphology, soil type, active geomorphic processes, elevation above and distance from the channel of Walnut Creek and its tributaries.
Major elements of the landscape include: ( 1) stream channels and flood plains (including
abandoned channel segments); and (2) hill crests and slopes, rising 15 to 20 m above the
flood plains at both sites. During the current investigation, all backhoe trenches and test
pits were excavated on the hill tops and extended short distances down slope.
Representative Stratigraphic Sections

Figures 17 and 18 illustrate the stratigraphic section exposed in backhoe trench 8 at
site 41RT267 on the northern slope of a low hill above Willow Creek. Capping the section
is stratigraphic Unit 1, the AB horizon of the soil profile. Thickness of the unit is variable,
ranging from 25 to 83 cm. Unit 1 is a relatively uniform, noncalcareous, silty very fine to
medium sand with rare coarse sand to pebbles. An abundance of fine to coarse roots and
root traces indicates that this stratum is heavily bioturbated. Late Archaic through Late
Prehistoric cultural materials lie in correct stratigraphic sequence through the unit.
Chert flakes are scattered and appear to have been redistributed by bioturbation and
slopewash; whereas burned sandstone cobbles and small boulders are clustered along the
lower boundary and have not been displaced. Additional burned-rock features appear
to lie above the irregular lower boundary and may have accumulated during accretion of
Unit 1. Radiocarbon assays show that the upper burned-rock features date from the
present millenium (see discussion by Robinson in this volume).
The top of underlying Unit 2 was eroded prior to or during the earliest phase of local
occupation. Bioturbation, particularly root penetration, has also enhanced disturbance
of the stratigraphic contact between Units 1 and 2. Units 2 through 4 are parts of the Bt
horizon of a buried soil not genetically linked to the overlying AB. Units 2 through 4 are

differentiated on the basis of illuvial clay content related to pedogenesis of the paleosol.
The parent material of this soil was a Late Pleistocene(?) fluvial deposit. Textural analysis
of samples collected from the measured section reveals little difference among Units 2
through 4 except for the high concentration of clay in Unit 3, the Bt2b horizon. This is
the "clay bulge" characteristic of argillic B horizons. The bulge gradually moves
downward through the profile. Unit 5, the Cb horizon at the base of this paleosol, appears
to be slightly enriched in clay, indicating illuviation was continuing at the time the
paleosol was buried. Figure 14 shows that Unit 1 drapes over the eroded margin of the
paleosol, which thins slopeward.
Sheet erosion, gullying, and tree throw probably combined to mobilize sediment on
the low-relief hill crest at site 41RT267. These processes remain active in the area today.
The tree-covered hills are subject to windstorms capable to toppling one or more trees
at a time. Trees may also succumb to disease or insects. When a tree falls, its roots pull
up a pallet of sediment which is gradually released by rains and decomposition of the root
ball. Some of the sediment may refill the depression excavated during tree fall, while the
rest is moved down slope by sheet wash. Tree throw may displace the entire upper part
of the section at a given point, destroying the integrity of any cultural materials that had
been buried there; but the displaced sediment is soon mobilized and may help bury other
parts of the site, protecting part of the archeological record.
Gullying may also be an important process in sediment redistribution. Gullies often
form after disruption of ground cover by fire, overgrazing, or adverse climatic conditions.
These factors may have contributed to formation of gullies at this site, but another causal
mechanism was actually observed during the field investigation. Piping is a type of
erosion resulting from discharge of ground water on a persistent or seasonal basis. As
rain infiltrates the porous sands covering the hills, it moves downward through the section
until it reaches an impermeable retarding layer or aquitard. The water then moves
laterally toward the hill slopes and may seep out preferentially along a stratigraphic
boundary. High pore pressures are generated in the sedimentabove the aquitard, which

41R1267 I 69

may actually cause this material to flow, resulting in erosion. A trough forms where the
sediment flows out. If runoff is subsequently concentrated in the trough, gullying may be
initiated.
Implications For Cultural Resource Assessment

Archeological testing and geomorphic investigations were conducted at two sites,
41RT267 and 41RT288, which are characterized by evidence of Late Archaic through
Late Prehistoric occupation. Well-defined, laterally-extensive paleosols developed in
Late Pleistocene(?) fluvial deposits may have enveloped the Late Archaic landscape.
Before or during the period of continual occupation, erosion briefly interrupted soil
development. A combination of tree throw, gullying, and sheet erosion redistributed
sediment at these sites, burying the Late Archaic record. Deposition continued
throughout subsequent occupation, creating a stratified cultural array. There appears to
be no possibility that pre-Late Archaic materials could be found in these sections. The
extensive paleosol may have covered a wide area, thus providing a broad activity surface
on which cultural resources may occur. Conditions at these sites created unusually
favorable rates and styles of sediment aggradation in an upland setting. These conditions
are responsible for preservation of cultural features at site 41RT267.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The 1992 mitigation program succeeded in its goal of increasing data recovery to
enhance testing of theoretical propositions about regional prehistory. Specifically, an
occupation zone associated with the Late Archaic component of the site was defined and
cleared in the deep test formed by test pits 17-20. Features 3 and 4 were redefined and
cleared, and additional Features 6, 7, and 8 were discovered. The inventory of diagnostic
artifacts was enlarged, and the overall artifact assemblage was increased to a level which
may be considered representative of the prehistoric occupations. Radiocarbon dating of
soil organics (TX-7674; 530 years Â±60 B.P.; TX-7675: 660 years Â± 70 B.P. ) confirmed the
Late Prehistoric placement of the upper occupation zone and its burned rock features,
and it lengthened the estimated span of reoccupations of the site.
The 1992 mitigation program was able to make additional tests of current formulations of regional hunter-gatherer mobility patterns. The comparison of the Late Archaic
and Late Prehistoric occupation zones was made by examining an appropriate artifact
category with functional implications, in this case utilized flakes/modified debitage The
means of the function scores of the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric utilized flakes are
different, but statistical tests of significance of the difference could not be made due to
the disparity in sample sizes and the scores' basis in ranked rather than linear data.
The spatial analysis of the burned rock features and artifact distributions gave mixed
results in terms of the Brooks and Yellen (1987) model. While all the features showed
evidence of reuse in the form of multiple firings, Features 4, 6, 7, and 8 also evinced
reoccupation in the form of disruption in the patterning of their rocks. Furthermore, the
near-absence of burned rock near Feature 3, which is also the best maintained and least
disrupted feature, raises the possibility that it may have been inside a hut. According to
Brooks and Yellen (1987), disruption of a site feature would be due to a larger site
population, longer terms of residence, and material-robbing for use in similar installations elsewhere. These processes are expected at domestic campsites where shelter
construction is also more likely (especially in the winter), whereas precise reuse of
features and site furniture is a strong pattern of site function at hunting camps and other
sites of limited function, where a small material and tool inventory is brought to the site
by a partial social segment (e.g. an all-male hunting group).
This application of the Brooks and Yellen model is considered partially successful;
more theory-building is needed, as are additional applications of the theory in the Brazos
uplands. Perhaps, assuming the model to be highly accurate, the conflicting findings at
the Big Willow Creek Site point to oscillations in the mobility patterns of huntergatherers in the Late Prehistoric. The weight of the evidence points to predominant use
of the site as a hunting camp. Every tenth year, hypothetically, the site may have been

71

72 I CALVERT MINE 1992

favorable or needed as a domestic campsite. The site may have served different functions
at different times, a circumstance modeled, with ethnoarcheological examples, by Binford (1982). Another feasible alternative sees a resident social group larger than a
pared-down, efficient set of hunters, but smaller than the full social group. In this
scheme, additional societal members could accompany hunters to the site, forming a
domestic element. This sub-group would provide labor for embedded efforts subsumed
under the overall hunting purposes for which the site was visited. Examples of their tasks
are nut-collection, butchering, meat-smoking, and hide-processing. These activities
would assume greater importance as efforts to lay in seasonal surpluses in anticipation
of the resource-depleted winter. This scheme is consonant with the inference of site
occupations in the autumn.
Experimental analysis of the Simsboro sandstone fired in the burned rock features
strongly indicated a minimum firing temperature of 300Â° C for all the hearths. This
temperature would be adequate for cooking a wide variety of vegetal and animal foods.
The temperature threshold is below that for successful firing of most aboriginal ceramics.
This hearth temperature, however, would be sufficient to heat-treat many forms of chert
for toolmaking, as many cherts begin their responses to heat in the range of 250Â° C to
450Â° C (Luedtke 1992: 99-101). Evidence of heat treatment was not observed in the
debitage assemblage, however, and this potential was apparently disregarded by the site's
inhabitants. Maximum firing temperatures and other hearth functional inferences could
be pursued by follow-on research building on the experimental firing, but this program
is not currently feasible.
Pollen analysis returned its best results from samples in the Late Prehistoric zone,
although pollen counts remained too low for statistical analysis of pollen patterning. The
most common plants and groups were oak and grasses, and also present were juniper and
pine (one grain each), high-spine composites, sagebrush, amaranth and pigweed families,
Rosaceae, and Umbelliferae. The Late Archaic sample yielded one grain each of oak,
high-spine composite, and Umbelliferae.
The mitigation of the Big Willow Creek Site accomplished its goals of enhancing data
recovery and further testing of propositions about hunter-gatherer mobility, economy,
and subsistence systems. Further field investigations would not contribute more to these
efforts. In this light, the mitigation of 41RT267 should be considered complete.

APPENDIX
Historic Site Documentation: 41RT93 and 41RT302
Dan K. Utley and Solveig A. Turpin

In 1992, TARL gained approval for a plan to mitigate the effects of mine development
on two historic sites, 41RT93 and 41RT302, that had been determined eligible for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) by the State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The procedures were
modeled on methods previously used to document two other historic properties in the
Calvert Mine. The focal point of the small dispersed farming community of Tidwell
Prairie, the Weaver-Rushing House, 41RT260, was recorded by large format and 35 mm
photography and Historic American Building Standards quality drawings (Utley, Fox, and
Mehalchick 1990). Test pits and shovel probes dug at 41RT260 and six other potentially
eligible houses proved unproductive, largely because most of these structures were
occupied during the twentieth-century when mass produced goods were available to rural
people, regardless of their nationality or race.
A second historic site that met criteria for listing on the NRHP, the Ed Okonski
Farmstead, 41RT254, remained in private hands so no subsurface exploration was attempted. This model farm gained much of its significance from th~ orderly layout of
house and outbuildings, typical of turn-of-the-century Polish farmsteads in the region.
The configuration of the farm was documented through a transit and stadia map,
generated by AUTOCAD, and large format and 35 mm photography (Utley, Fox, and
Mehalchick 1990). This precedent was followed at the two sites reported here: 41RT 93,
the Rehberg Homestead, and 41RT302, the Bienzenski Farmstead. Both were evaluated
as eligible because they represent typical architectural and structural patterns, rather
than their association with important people or events in local history. In addition,
descendants of the immigrant families that built these farmsteads still live in local
communities where they could provide relevant details. It was therefore deemed most
important to record the layout of the farmsteads and their general appearance rather than
accumulate more twentieth-century artifacts.
41RT93, the Rehberg Homestead

The log and frame structures that make up the Rehberg Homestead, 41RT93 (Fig.
19), first came to the attention of Martha Freeman during the initial reconnaissance of
the Calvert Mine in 1978 (Good, Turpin, and Freeman 1980: Figure 13). At that time, a
local informant attributed the site to Sam Stephenson, a member of one of the first
families of Tidwell and Beck Prairie areas, and a relative by marriage of the Rehbergs.

APPENDIX I 85

Freeman was impressed by the integrity of the log structures and recommended that they
be recorded to architectural standards.
In 1986, the intensive survey of the Calvert Mine included more in-depth study of
41RT93. Title abstracts provided by Phillips Coal Company documented the chain of
ownership. The state of Texas patented the land to Samuel R. Smith, an assignee of
Thomas H. Brennan, in 1854. Between 1875 and 1892, title passed to four different
owners, none of whom held it long or apparently made any improvements. Wilhelm
Rehberg acquired 273 acres for $821.55 on November 28, 1892 and paid his vendor's lien
the next year. In 1937, Wilhelm conveyed his interest to his son, Paul. His wife, Ida, had
died intestate, leaving her interest to Paul and his sister, Lena Rehberg Stephenson. Lena
conveyed her interest to Paul in 1940. The property has remained in the Rehberg family,
although divided between Paul and Bessie Rehberg's heirs, Robert Rehberg, Frieda
Rains, and Edna Mae Lastor. Local tradition, which attributed the property to William
and Julia McGaha (Davis et al. 1987:61), conflicts with the deed records.
Mrs. Frieda Rehberg Rains was interviewed for information about the family and the
construction of the buildings. She attributed the buildings to her grandfather, William
or Wilhelm Rehberg, a native of Germany who moved to Tidwell Prairie from New
Baden, east of Owensville in Robertson County. Thus, the Rehbergs were the only
German family in the immediate area.
Mrs. Rains' father, Paul Rehberg, remembered clearing the land of its native forest
as a very young lad, perhaps supplying some of the logs used in the farm buildings. The
house was originally a one-room log pen, later expanded by the addition of three rooms
and a central hall (Figs. 20, 21). The resulting configuration is an L-plan, vaguely
reminiscent of Victorian structures of the early 20th century. Board-and-batten siding
covers the original log walls. The front facade features a shed porch flanked by a gable
roof line (Fig. 21). The original shingles were at some time covered by corrugated tin
which is now peeling from the roof. A hand-dug well and a cistern supplied water for
domestic use and animal husbandry.
The most substantial outbuilding is a double crib log barn, now collapsing (Fig. 22).
Two other sheds were also built of smaller, unpeeled logs. All the logs were joined by
single saddle corner notching. Some 350 meters southeast of the main farm complex, a
double crib log barn and a board-and-batten poultry house lie on the slopes of prehistoric
site 41RT288, overlooking Walnut Creek (Fig. 2).
The buildings have stood empty and open to the elements since before their original
recording by Freeman. The central supports of the double crib log barn have weakened,
so the building leans at an angle that threatens imminent collapse. The house has lost its
structural integrity as well. The original log section has pulled away from the additions
which are also rapidly deteriorating.
In 1992, 41RT93 was determined eligible for the NRHP, at the local level of significance, under Criteria A, in the area of agricultural lifeways, and C, architectural
qualities (Bruseth 1992a). The large format and 35 mm photography, and transit mapping
of the site, considered the most appropriate mitigative measures given the structural
decline and instability of the buildings, were completed in 1992. Nine 4 by 5 in and 28

41RT302, Bienzenski Farm

This farm complex was first recorded during the intensive survey of the Calvert Mine
in 1986 (Davis et al. 1987). The SHPO and EPA determined that the site was eligible for
listing on the NRHP at the local level of significance under Criterion C "because of its
architectural qualities as an early twentieth century family farm since it possesses a high
degree of integrity" (Bruseth 1992b ).
John Bienzenski, patriarch of the family, was born in Poland but raised in McClanahan, a small community near Marlin, in Falls County. He purchased the Robertson
County property, part of the T.H. Brennan and John Trudeau surveys, in 1910. The house
is located on the Brennan survey which was originally patented to Samuel R. Smith, an
assignee, in 1854. From 1896 to 1910, the land was owned by Arthur Rushing whose
history has been detailed in Utley, Fox, and Mehalchick (1990) as part of the documentation of NRHP property, 41RT260, the Weaver-Rushing House. John Bienzenski, and
his wife, Mary nee Sterempski, purchased the property from the Rushings and built their
home around 1913. There, they raised eight children, three girls and five boys, including
Bruno Bienzenski who provided the family oral history. John Bienzenski died in 1950,
his wife survived him by 26 years.
According to Mr. Bienzenski, he helped build all of the outbuildings except three,
indicating that most of the 11 extant structures have been constructed since the 1920s.
Mr. Bienzenski also explained how each of these buildings was used in their farming
operation (Fig. 23): smokehouse, garage, 3 barns, chicken house, pigpen, blacksmith
shop, and storage sheds. Electricity was brought to the farm by the REA in the 1940s.
Mr. Bienzenski recalled that cotton and corn was raised on the property until four
years after he returned from the Second World War. Around 1951, the emphasis changed
to cattle, a trend followed by most of the other landowners in the Tidwell Prairie area
(Utley, Fox, and Mehalchick 1990).
The main house is of L-shaped design with horizontal bevel siding, corrugated tin
roofing, and porches on both front and back elevations (Figs. 24, 25). Detailing includes
a front-facing gable roof, turned porch posts, four-over-four windows, and spindle brackets (Fig. 25b ). The verticality of the structure, along with the gables and overall design,
denote a late Victorian style farmhouse of the type often available as mail-order kits.
Eight outbuildings are clustered behind the main house and three lie at considerable
distance on either side of a large stock tank (Fig. 23), but none exhibit the level of
construction seen in the main house. Most of the farm implements and domestic debris
noted on the original site form had been removed prior to the more formal documentation reported here.
