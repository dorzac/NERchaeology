Abstract
Paradigm Hotel Group, LLC of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas
Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of two properties along the
San Antonio River in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The tracts were proposed to be
developed as a Wyndham Hotel complex. The properties were privately owned, and no public
funding was involved either in the proposed development of the property, nor in the
archaeological survey. The need for an archaeological survey was triggered due to the fact that
the City of San Antonio Office of Historic Preservation was able to introduce changes to the
Historic Preservation Section of the UDC, Section VI that requires archaeological surveys in
the River Improvement Overlay Districts (RIOs). The Historic Design and Review Commission
(HDRC) reviews all such projects being built within the RIOs in order to issue a Certificate of
Appropriateness for the construction. The City Archeologist reviews all projects for potential
archaeological deposits as part of the design review through HDRC. Although the City’s
Development Code required an archaeological survey, and subsequent review of this
archaeological report by the City Archeologist, no Antiquities Permit was required.
Tierras Antiguas conducted a thorough pedestrian survey of the surface area on October 29,
2011, and one shovel test and five backhoe trenches were excavated. No evidence of prehistoric
cultural material was observed either on or below the surface. Although historic artifacts were
observed and documented, all were within heavily disturbed, fill contexts. No artifacts were
collected or curated.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that Paradigm Hotel Group, LLC be
allowed to develop the tracts as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that
if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development, work
should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and evaluated
by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the City of San
Antonio Archeologist.

Acknowledgments

First and foremost, I express my sincere appreciation to Mr. Tim Sanford of Paradigm Hotel
Group, LLC. Tim met with me at the site before the archaeological survey began, was extremely
helpful and patient in explaining the scope of this project, and he graciously shared previous
environmental and historical documents.
On an equal note, I appreciate very much the professional advice of Ms. Kay Hindes, the City
Archeologist for the City of San Antonio. Throughout the project, Kay was very supportive, and
her knowledge of the early history of San Antonio was extremely helpful.
Next, I wish to extend a hearty thank you to Tim Fox, Project Manager at Arias & Associates,
and John Kniffin, Field Technician at Arias & Associates. These gentlemen are experts in
evaluating subsurface soils and geology relative to large scale modern development. Fortunately,
I was able to conduct the archaeological investigation in conjunction with their exploratory
subsurface backhoe trenching operations.
Two individuals who were extremely helpful and who made significant cointributions to the
completion of this report are Joel Butler and Kristi Ulrich. Joel masterfully created the map
overlays presented, and also penned a portion of the environmental setting of the Project Area.
Kristi demonstrated her passion for San Antonio history by delving into the Bexar archives and
other historical documents to detail the ownership and history of the two tracts involved. Thank
you, Joel and Kristi.
Finally, I very much relied upon Belisario Silva, an archaeological Field Technician for Tierras
Antiguas. He is a dedicated individual, and as always, Belisario worked meticulously to ensure
all aspects of this investigation were thoroughly documented in accordance with Texas
Historical Commission and Council of Texas Archeologists standards.

Introduction
Paradigm Hotel Group, LLC of
San Antonio, Texas intends to
commercially develop the
Project Area (Figures 1-4),
which consists of two (2) tracts
of land located at the
intersection of Arden Grove and
Ninth Street, and separated by
Ninth Street in San Antonio,
Bexar County, Texas. The 0.34
acre tract (15,000 sq. ft.
secondary tract) is located on
the northwest corner of Arden
Grove and Ninth Street, and the
1.365 acre tract (main tract) is
located on the southwest corner
of Ninth Street and the San
Antonio River. The main tract is
bounded on the southeast by the
San Antonio River, on the
southwest by a vacant tract, and Figure 1. Location of the Project Area and Bexar County.
on the north and northeast by
Ninth Street. The secondary
tract is bounded on the east by
Arden Grove, on the south by
Ninth Street, on the northwest
by a funeral home parking lot,
and on the north by a
commercial property.
Both tracts are privately owned,
and the development will be
privately funded; as such, a
Texas Antiquities Permit is not
applicable. However, the
proposed Scope of Work for

subsequent cultural resources survey report was forwarded for review by the City of San
Antonio (COSA) City Archeologist at the Office of Historic Preservation. Following that,
Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) conducted a 100% pedestrian survey of
the Project Area on October 29, 2011.

In addition to the surface survey, Tierras Antiguas excavated one shovel test and monitored the
excavation of five backhoe trenches. The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA), and the City
of San Antonio Office of Historic Preservation.

Project Setting
Geology
The local geology (Barnes 1994) (Figure 5) within the project area is of Quaternary Alluvial
Terrace deposits (Qt), locally a combined depositional sequence of Austin Chalk (Kau),
undivided Navarro and Marlbrook Marl (Knb), Pecan Gap Chalk (Kpg), Uvalde Gravels (Qtu).
Edwards chert is a common gravel component across the region, a result of down-cutting of the
Edwards Plateau. Edwards chert and the Uvalde Gravels both provided Native Americans a rich
resource for lithic tool production.

2

Soils
Soils within the project area consist of
Trinity Frio, 0 to 1%, frequently
flooded (Tf) (USDA-NRCS) (Figure 6).
These are typically deep alluvial clay
soils associated with Quaternary-aged
deposition from a variety of regional
sources within the floodplains of large
streams in well-developed drainage
basins Taylor et al. 1991). They are
frequently flooded and subject to
scouring or shifting. A typical pedon of
this soil is as follows:
Figure 5. Geological map of the area.
0-50 inches (0-127 centimeters) - dark
gray, subangular blocky, calcareous
clay
50-65 inches (127-165 centimeters) gray, weak subangular blocky,
calcareous clay
65-144 inches (165-366 cm) - gray,
clayey alluvium overlying waterworn
gravels
Because this soil is typically very deep
and contains deposits of Late
Pleistocene and Holocene age, it has
potential for intact well-stratified
prehistoric cultural components to great
depths. However, considering that the
Project Area has been the subject of
numerous stream revetment and
re-routing episodes, the soil column may
not retain its original integrity.

Hydrology

San Antonio River sub-basin of the San
Antonio River Basin (Figure 7). This
basin is fed by streams arising in the Figure 7. Hydrology map of the area.
southern and southeastern Edwards
Plateau and terminates at San Antonio Bay in the Gulf of Mexico. Within the San Antonio area,
several large creeks contribute to its flow, including Salado, Rosillo, and Olmos Creeks
(TWDB).

Cultural Context and Chronology
Introduction
The Project Area is located within South-Central Texas, and as such, prehistoric cultural
affinities most common to South Texas plains cultures and Central Texas hill country cultures
are often manifested in archaeological sites along the upper San Antonio River basin. The most
basic chronology of the Central and South Texas regions can be divided into either: (1)
prehistoric cultural groups with no specific tribal affiliation, or; (2) historically documented
groups with a designated tribal or band name. Before Spanish soldiers and Catholic missionaries
arrived in Texas, the cultural activities of the groups of prehistoric Native Americans who
inhabited the two regions can only be surmised from what we can glean from the archaeological
records at undisturbed, and well-documented sites. Historic cultural groups are those observed
firsthand by the Spanish soldiers and priests beginning in the late 1600s. The Spanish then began
recording in writing the names, numbers, and living conditions of the many groups of Native
Americans who lived in the regions. However, as I will discuss later in this section, there is a
significant transition era between the least archaeologically known prehistoric cultural groups,
and the historic Native Americans that the Spanish documented; the transition era occurs in the
1500s when Spanish explorers and treasure seekers ventured through Texas.

The Prehistoric Chronology
Based on research in Texas over the past 70+ years, beginning with professionals from the
University of Texas at Austin, archaeologists have been able to segregate the prehistoric period
in Central and South Texas into the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. Although
other archaeologists have made significant foundational contributions to our current
understanding of how past cultures changed through time (e.g., Story 1985; Prewitt 1981), in my
opinion the most current and widely recognized chronologies are those offered by Michael
Collins (1995) for Central Texas, and Thomas Hester (1995) for South Texas.
Paleoindian Period (11,500-8,800 years ago)
With minor differences observed in the archaeological record across the wide expanse of Central
and South Texas, this period spans the past years estimated at between ca. 11,500 and 8,800
years ago (Collins 1995:381–383; Hester 1995:433–436). Diagnostic artifacts include a unique,
fluted, finely flaked, and blade-shaped spear or dart point called “Clovis”, other stone tools
chipped on both sides, and unique prismatic blade-like flakes systematically knocked off from
river cobbles. Archaeologists have documented Clovis-age sites in Central and South Texas such
as killsites, quarries, stone tool caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Collins
1995:381–383; Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts
are fairly common in Central and South Texas; however, no campsites or killsites have been
found south of Bexar County (Hester 1995:434–435).
During this 2,700-year Paleoindian period around the project area, the Native Americans we
term as the Paleoindian culture were likely one of small bands of nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and
4

horse that are now extinct in North America (Black 1989). Nevertheless, when big game was
not available, we have archaeological evidence that the Paleoindian peoples supplemented their
diet by eating turtles, tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Collins 1995:381).
Archaic Period (8,000-1,200 years ago)
Primarily, by studying the differences in the stone tools, the diversities in campsites or other
types of sites, the locations of the sites, as well as many other measurable and analytical
observations such as ethnobotanical and faunal remains found at Central and South Texas
archaeological sites, archaeologists have been able to dissect about 6,000 years of our past into
what we commonly term the “Archaic”. Based on these same aforementioned affinities, the
Archaic has further been defined in terms of the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic, and the Late
Archaic.
Early Archaic (ca. 8,800-6,000 years ago)
The region was most probably occupied by small groups who moved almost constantly during
the Early Archaic period. Archaeologists have observed a distinctive change in projectile point
styles that are unique to this period; they include Early Corner Notched and Early Basal Notched
dart points. Although they were still very much hunters and gatherers, the large animals such as
mammoths that their Paleoindian ancestors had hunted were by this time extinct. To survive,
they capitalized on exploiting the other abundant food resources that Central Texas had to offer
Texas—such as deer, fish, rodents, prickly pear tunas, and various plant bulbs and tubers.
Archaeologists point to the increased numbers of ground stone, firecracked limestone used in
cooking ovens larger in size than normal campfires, and specialized stone processing tools as
evidence that Native Americans refocused their pursuit of foodstuffs (Weir 1976; McKinney
1981; Story 1985; Collins 1995; Hester 1995).
Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000-4,000 years ago?)
When this period actually began and ended is always debatable among archaeologists. Some
(e.g., Collins 1995) see a significant pattern in the archaeological record between 6,000 and
4,000 years ago, but others (e.g., Hester 1995) don’t think the same changes were prevalent until
much later in South Texas - about between 4,500 and 2,400 years ago. Nevertheless, the climate
began changing in Central and South Texas beginning around 6,000 years ago, and a continuum
of dry climate known as the Altithermal, is believed by some archaeologists to have caused the
Native Americans to gather in larger groups. They gathered in large groups to exploit plant foods
that were more dependable than larger game animals such as bison (Sollberger and Hester
1972:338; Weir 1976:125, 128; Story 1985:40). Archaeologists have found more sites that date
to this period, and in Summer seasons the groups apparently took advantage of the numerous
prickly pear tunas and pads that thrived in the environs of South-Central Texas, as well as deer
and rabbit (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15; Collins 1995:383).
Later, they apparently congregated along the many creeks and rivers in the area to gather the
abundant and nutritional nuts ripening in the Fall (Black 1989). On the Edwards Plateau, they
may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large cooking ovens to steam the tanic
acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large cooking ovens were apparently
used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used within just a few years or over
5

several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems to be that they were used
to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin
et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of accumulated firecracked rocks
are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological community, but are sometimes referred
to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
Late Archaic (4,000-1,200 years ago?)
As with my synthesis of the Middle Archaic period, differences in the traits of Native Americans
inhabiting Central and South Texas during the Late Archaic period may have occurred over
several hundred years. Whether it was a matter of cultural adaptation or an adaption to the
environment is questionable. In either case, the uniqueness seen in archaeological sites of the
two regions imply that change may have been slower in South Texas than in Central Texas.
Collins (1995) dates the final interval of the Archaic in Central Texas to approximately
4,000–1,200 years ago, while Hester (1995) believes the Late Archaic traits seen in South Texas
archaeological sites may better be defined as between 2,400–1,300 years ago. The large cooking
ovens which after repeated uses coalesced into burned rock middens, intensified during the Late
Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same
or fell during this period (Black 1989:30). Although the Native Americans of Central Texas still
sought the abundant acorns, prickly pear, and riverine plant foods such as nuts, the slightly
cooler and moister climate allowed them to pursue other food goods. Even though by about
1,500 years ago the gregarious, large herds of bison no longer predominated the now-dwindling
grasslands of Central and South Texas (Dillehay 1974), the Native Americans still hunted and/or
gathered deer and smaller animals such as rabbits, rodents, fish, and turtles (Black 1989:30).
Although farther south, near Brownsville and Rockport, the Native Americans inhabiting those
areas began making pottery about 1,800 years ago, those groups farther to the north, around the
Panther Springs Creek area, either elected not to make pottery vessels, lacked the skills, or
because of their generally highly nomadic lifestyle, simply elected not to use the easily
breakable vessels until 1,000± years later (Story 1985:45–47). In addition to the uniqueness of
Central Texas’ hunter-gatherers not adapting to the use of pottery, archaeologists have also
observed a noticeable change in the styles/types of killing dart points used during the Late
Archaic. Keep in mind that dart points were manufactured to be used with the atlatyl, a spearlike shaft with a dart point attached to it, and thrown or launched from over the shoulder. It
would not be until perhaps 1,200 years ago that the bow-and-arrow was adapted for use for
hunting in the region. Late Archaic dart points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic
points, and the most common dart points that are found within the area are what archaeologists
call Ensor and Frio types (Turner and Hester 1999:114,122).
As with most spectrums of scientific research, there is ongoing speculation amongst professional
archaeologists as to when, and what traits mark a transition between the Late Archaic, huntergatherer practices of Central Texans and the Late Prehistoric peoples who presumably began to
settle down into territorial groups claiming a part of the landscape as their own.

6

Transitional Archaic (2,300 - 1,300 years ago?)
A clear and abrupt transition of Native Americans adapting or developing the traits that
archaeologists define as being inclusive to the Late Archaic period, separate from the Late
Prehsitoric period, around the project area is simply not distinct in the many sites that
archaeologists have been able to excavate and analyze. In effect, some of the same
characteristics that archaeologists see in Late Archaic artifacts and earlier Late Prehistoric
assemblages left behind are nearly identical - or at least transitional in technology and style.
Therefore, some archaeologists prefer to deem this transitional period as the “Terminal, or
Transitional Archaic”, spanning from approximately 1,200 to perhaps as long ago as 2,300 years
ago - depending on where in South or Central Texas the groups who left behind the now-present
archaeological sites were living (Weir 1976; Hester 1995). Nevertheless, the increased number
of burned rock midden sites that archaeologists have documented in Central Texas, and that date
to this time period, suggest that people returned time and again to the same sites to once again
take advantage of cooking and eating the abundant plants available during this time (e.g.,
Mauldin et al. 2003).
Late Prehistoric Period (ca. 1,250-300 Years Ago)
Although artifacts commonly associated with earlier Late Archaic occupations are also found
on some Late Prehistoric-in-age archaeological sites, archaeologists have documented a distinct
change in projectile point styles that Native Americans began manufacturing about 1,250 years
ago. These stone points suggest that Native Americans in the Central and South Texas regions
surrounding the Gardens at Pinnacle project area adapted the bow-and-arrow as a weapon rather
than the shoulder-thrown atlatyl with a dart point attached. As such, the stone points devised for
killing became much smaller and streamlined. In layman terminology, the smaller, sleeker shafts
arrow shafts carried an “arrowhead”, instead of a dart point. Archaeologists have found Edwards
and Scallorn arrow points dating to the earliest 600+ years of the period (e.g., Goode 1991:71).
Concurrently, excavations by professional archaeologists have provided evidence that Native
Americans began using crude clay pottery vessels made from local clays, as well as perhaps
trading vessels from the South, Southeast Coastal, and Northeast Texas regions. As with any
successful venture, the making of pottery was refined so that vessels were used more, and the
technique of firing became perhaps an art (e.g., Story 1985:45-47; Black 1989:32; Hester 1995;
Nickels 2000).
Archaeologists probably know more about the Native Americans who lived in Texas during this
time than any other time in prehistory (Hester 1995). They continued to build large cooking
ovens that we commonly call “Indian Mounds”, or burned rock middens in which they roasted
tubers nuts, and some game animals (see for example, Mauldin et al. 2003). During this same
period, the inhabitants may have increased their dependence upon bison (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468). Huebner (1991) suggests that the sudden return of bison to South and Central
Texas resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grassiness
in the Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north Central Texas, forming a “bison corridor”
into the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau (Huebner
1991:354–355).
One theory is that perhaps there were not as many people occupying Central Texas and the area
7

around the Gardens at Pinnacle during the Late Prehistoric period (Black 1989:32). We do know
that they began occupying the limestone overhangs and rockshelters created by the many creeks
and rivers cutting into the Balcones Escarpment limestone cliffs. Examples of rockshelters
occupied by Native Americans along the escarpment include Scorpion Cave beside the Medina
River in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978), Classen Rockshelter along Cibolo Creek in
northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967), and Timmeron Rockshelter in Hays County (Harris
1985).
Historic Period
Primarily beginning slightly over 300 years ago, European explorers, entrepreneurs, Catholic
missionaries, and government officials encroached into what is today South and Central Texas
in ever-increasing numbers. This transitional end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the
Historic period in both Central and South Texas is characterized by a continuum of written
accounts of European contact with the numerous indigenous, Native American groups
encountered in the two regions. In Central Texas, we can be ever grateful to the meticulous
writings of the Spanish priests and government officials for their recording of the names,
numbers, and lifeways of the indigenous groups. However, South Texas at the time was largely
bypassed by early Euro-Americans seeking permanent settlement. As such, the technology and
lifestyles of the indigenous groups in South Texas may have been affected by transient European
influence, but today we can only observe these changes in the archaeological record because the
written accounts simply are not available. Dr. Thomas Hester (1995) is most often credited with
recognizing this transitional period between the Late Prehistoric and the Historic, and labels this
largely unknown period as the “Protohistoric.”
Traveling northward from present-day central Mexico in the 1500s and 1600s, the Spanish
encountered numerous small groups of Coahuiltecans (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell
1985; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). In later years, intrusive groups
such as the Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and Comanche took over the lands roamed by the
Coahuiltecans (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993;
Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
For example, around A.D. 1700, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed northward
by continual Spanish expansion. But by about 1750, the Apache, adapting to a more Southern
Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting, entered what is today’s Texas from the northwest. Their
incursion was especially rapid because they had acquired horses from the Spaniards (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27). As if the indigenous groups were not effectively dispersed and
disrupted by the Apaches, the remnants of native American cohesion that previously existed in
Central Texas were even further disrupted by the nomadic, bison-hunting Comanche from the
High Plains of Texas (Campbell 1991:111).
Thus ensued over a century of turmoil for those numerous, but splintered Native American
groups who had established a semi-permanent foothold in Central Texas before the arrival of
the Apache and Comanche. They must have been heavily traumatized and significantly
demoralized over the constant conflicts resulting in death, and the mysterious diseases caused
by the forced continual mixing and remixing among ethnicities from around the regions and the
8

world (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Supposedly, there were dozens if
not hundreds of language dialects that were spoken by the earlier inhabitants, but nearly all have
been lost (e.g. Johnson 1994; Johnson and Campbell 1992).
Amidst the turmoil, the Spanish Catholic missions became a refuge for many of the otherwise
dispersed bands and tribes within Texas. By the early 1700s, several missions had been
established, and reestablished within the Nacogdoches and San Antonio areas (Campbell and
Campbell 1985; Chipman 1992; de la Teja 1995; Habig 1968a, 1968b; Hard et al. 1995). Those
that entered the missions did so usually voluntarily, seeking refuge from more powerful, warring
bands or tribes. Others did so because they were starved for food that the protective missions
could offer in seasons of natural destitution. Regardless, the Spanish government saw the
Catholic religious zeal as a means of peaceful conquest in an otherwise untenable, unsettled, and
hostile environment. At the same time, each and every Native American who relied upon support
from the Spanish missions became less of a threat to eventual Spanish domination of the region,
and infiltration by France or other countries (Campbell 1975:2; 1991:346–347).
Although a treaty with the Apaches in 1749 brought peace for a while, Apaches continued to
range over the area between San Antonio and Laredo until the early 1800s, pushed southward
by the invading Comanche who had moved into the Hill Country of Central Texas (Campbell
and Campbell 1985:27; de la Teja 1995:100). In 1785, a peace treaty was agreed to in Santa Fe,
New Mexico between the Spanish Crown and the Comanches. Although the ceremony of this
treaty took place hundreds of miles to the west, its signing signaled the opening of a period of
peaceful coexistence in what is today Bexar County, in which Comanches brought hides, meat,
and tallow to San Antonio to trade for goods and services not available elsewhere, such as
blacksmithing and gun repair (Fehrenbach 1983:221-224; Poyo and Hinojosa 1991:125-126).
In 1821, after a hard-fought rebellion, Mexico gained its national sovereignty from Spain;
including the vast expanse that was to become the Republic of Texas. After only 15 years, the
combined Tejano and Euro-American compatriots rebelled against Mexican rule, and defeated
the Mexican army to declare an independent Republic of Texas in 1836. By the 1840s, the city
of San Antonio was well-established as the most progressive and most populated city in the
newly formed Republic. The image of San Antonio as a metropolitan magnet has been enhanced
in a continuum ever since, from Texas’ evolution into statehood in 1846, through today.

Previous Archaeological Work in the Area
The first officially recognized local (Bexar County) institution organized to promote an interest
in Texas archaeology was the Witte Memorial Museum, established in 1926 (Fehrenbach
1978:195; Martin 1933). The Witte continues to this day to promote to citizens of all ages the
need to preserve our cultural resources. Almost 40 years ago, in the early 1970s, two other
organizations were formed. The Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at the University
of Texas at San Antonio was born in 1973. As the Center’s first director, Dr. Tom Hester sought
to foster a hand-in-hand relationship among amateur collectors, landowners, and professional
9

archaeologists. As such, he was instrumental in establishing the Southern Texas Archaeological
Association (STAA) in 1973, a dedicated bunch of individuals who were (and still are)
committed to documenting and preserving archaeological sites throughout Bexar County and
South Texas.
While we will never know for sure how many archaeological sites have been destroyed, or how
many still remain in Bexar County, we do know that professional and avocational archaeologists
have managed to document nearly 4,000 over the past 35+ years. Although it may seem odd that
there have been more sites recorded in Bexar County than in all its surrounding counties, and
the reader could presume that there are simply a whole lot more sites in Bexar, there are other
factors that influence the documentation of sites. For example, the largest city in the area is San
Antonio, and as such the city has many historic structures that qualify as archaeological sites that
skew the numbers in favor of Bexar County. Thanks to the city’s historic preservation office and
codes enacted by the city, many have been recorded over the years.
It also makes sense that the more pieces of property that archaeologists are able to examine, the
more sites are likely to be found. Most archaeological projects are undertaken because of Federal
and State Antiquity codes that require cultural resource surveys be conducted when public
money (tax dollars) are used for construction, such as highways, schools, prisons, etc. In
addition, military installations and the National Park Service (NPS) are required by federal law
to evaluate any cultural resources within their lands. Because of Bexar County’s explosive
population growth, many military installations, and the Spanish missions administered by NPS,
it seems reasonable that Bexar County should have more archaeological sites documented than
in the surrounding counties. In addition, professional and avocational archaeologists and
historians have been actively involved for many years in the county.
Construction undertaken to improve the San Antonio River channel, to include the river frontage
along the eastern edge of the project area was monitored by archaeologists from the Center for
Archaeological Research at The University of Texas at San Antonio (CAR-UTSA) during the
period May 2007 through February 2009. No cultural features were observed along the river
abutting the Project Area (Ulrich et al. 2009). The closest known archaeological sites are
41BX1817 and 41BX1818 (Figure 8).
Site 41BX1817 “...is a limestone dam and associated limestone retaining wall built to bring the
river, leading to a mill constructed downstream, at the corner of 8th Street and Avenue B. The
dam was constructed in 1883 to power the Alamo Mills and Flour Company. The dam pushed
water into the mill race that was located approximately two blocks south of the dam. The dam
was constructed of cut limestone blocks, that were expertly fit together. The dam showed
evidence of alteration over the years in the form of cement patches and a large portion missing
from the center of the dam to allow for more water flow. The mill race was filled circa 1904,
thereby leaving the dam useless” (Atlas 2011a; Ulrich et al. 2009). surface of the San Antonio

access the newly improved portion of the river. Other unique features along the Riverwalk have
been recorded as archaeological sites. This feature represents the completion of one of Hugman's
architectural feature designs. It is unique to the history and landscape of San Antonio” (Atlas
2011b; Ulrich 2009; Zunker 1983).
Historical neighborhood survey sites in close proximity and to the northeast of the Project Area
include a demolished native limestone house at 216 Arden Grove, a one-story frame house at
217 Arden Grove, a 1½ story frame house at 218 Arden Grove, a Greek revival saltbox house
at 222 Arden Grove, and a 1½ story frame house at 226 Arden Grove.

Archival Research
San Antonio River Channel Straightening
The earliest topographic map found of the Project Area was produced in 1903 (Figure 9). At this
time, the river channel in the area of 9th Street had not been straightened (Maps 1903). The next
map discovered is a 1909 street map (Figure 10). Once again, this map shows that the river
channel had not been straightened, and at that time Arden Grove Street was named Maverick
Grove (Maps 1909).

Figure 9. Modern overlay of the Project Area on 1903 topographic map (Maps 1903).
The next available map is a street map of San Antonio produced in 1920 (Maps 1920). Once
again this map shows that the river channel in the area of 9th Street had not been straightened
(Figure 11). Following a history of severe flooding in downtown San Antonio, particularly so
in the early 1900s, the engineer consulting firm of Metcalf and Eddy was hired by the city to
evaluate what could be done to prevent future flood disasters from occurring to the downtown.

In June 1920, they suggested that six cut-off across the bends in the river would alleviate the
problem. The second of six cuts was recommended between 8th and 10th Streets, at the
intersection of Ninth Street, Oakland, and Arden Grove (Metcalf and Eddy 1920; Ulrich et al.
2009).
13

In September 1921, a tropical disturbance that formed in the Gulf of Mexico and then settled
over the upper San Antonio River basin once again caused severe flooding throughout the city.
Following this disaster, the city’s Committee on Flood Prevention recommended the
construction of several cut-offs to straighten the river’s channel (San Antonio Express,
December 4, 1921). A bond issue passed in 1923 provided funding for the cut-off between 6th
and 9th Streets (San Antonio Express, December 5, 1923). Because of landowner protests over
property values, the city elected to condemn the disputed properties in 1928 (San Antonio
Express, October 16, 1928). Finally, as shown in Figure 12, by 1929, the old river channel no
longer existed, and the newly straightened channel along the east edge of Project Area was in
place (Maps 1929).

Figure 12. Modern overlay on 1929 City of San Antonio street map (Maps 1929).
Previous Structures within the Project Area
The earliest Sanborn’s Fire Insurance map of the Ninth Street and Maverick Grove (later Arden
Grove) areas show that the Baylor Hospital existed on the site in 1912, before the river channel
was straightened (Figure 13). It was constructed of a wooden frame covered with a wire and
stucco exterior, and measured approximately 140 feet long x 45 feet wide. It had steam heat,
with electric lights. The west set of wards was two-story with a stone basement; the east set of
wards was also two-story, but with an apparent unfinished basement. Elevators were located on
the west end of the west set of wards, and on the north front of the east set of wards; on the east
end was a one story, probable entrance. To the southwest and west respectively, were two-story
and a one-story outbuildings. At that time, both Ninth Street and Maverick Grove were
constructed of macadamized material.

14

Figure 13. Modern overlay on 1912 Sanborns Insurance Map (Maps 1912).
In 1937, the building and grounds were taken over by the Texas Methodist Mission Home &
Training School. The Texas Methodist Mission Home & Training School had its beginnings as
the Methodist Mission Home on San Saba Street in 1895. Its founder was Madam M. L. Volino
who ran a brothel on San Saba Street, but because of her conversion to Christianity, converted
the brothel into a rescue home for “fallen women”. When the San Saba mission became
overcrowded, the mission was moved into the old Baylor Hospital. The Texas Methodist
Mission Home & Training School outgrew the facility at Ninth and Arden, and abandoned that
location for newer facilities in 1945 (Methodist Mission Home 2011).

15

The history of the current project area is presented below. Tables 1 and 2 list each deed
record consulted from the Bexar County Deed Records (BCDR) online. The ownership of the
two tracts appears to overlap in their earliest years. All appear to have been part of the Anna
Maria Baca grant. Later, Samuel Maverick came into ownership. Sam Maverick became a
landowner of large tracts of land not only in San Antonio, but also in portions of West and
South Texas. He arrived in San Antonio in 1835, prior to the Siege of Bexar. He was put
under house arrest until December 1. At the time of his release, he encouraged an attack
which occurred on December 5, 1835. He left San Antonio on December 2 to meet with
delegates at Washington-on-the-Brazos to discuss Texas independence. Once the convention
ended, Maverick made his way back to his home in Alabama to attend to the family business.
During his time in Alabama he met and married Mary Ann Adams. In 1838, they returned to
San Antonio and established their home. This appears to be the time that Maverick began
acquiring large tracts of land. Mary and Sam Maverick continued to live in San Antonio on
and off until his death in 1870 (Marks 2012). No accounts of building a homestead on the
property was located during the deed research, so it is likely that this is just a parcel of land
that Maverick purchased during his land speculation. It is extremely likely that Sam and
Mary did not inhabit the property.

Main Tract (Tract 1)
The earliest deed found concerning the ownership of Tract 1 dates to 1872. The property was
conveyed to George Maverick (1845-1913) by his mother, Mary Maverick. George Maverick
was the son of Sam and Mary Maverick and later became a prominent land owner and is
credited for being a driving force in the development of San Antonio. The property, which
included the other tract in the current project, transferred to Mary Maverick after the death of
her husband, Sam. In 1872, Mary conveyed the property to George noting that it was part of
what Sam had intended to pass on to his son. It is highly unlikely that Maverick would have
used this property himself as he was out of San Antonio between 1862 and 1897
(Fenstermaker 2011).
Between 1872 and 1878, Maverick had dealings with David Geddes and associates
concerning the property. It was noted in the records encountered that the grantees had to
allow Ninth and Tenth Streets to pass through the property and allow public usage of the
streets with no impediments. In addition, the grantees were tasked with building a bridge that
would allow passage over the mill race on the property. The bridge over the mill race is
noted on the 1896 Sanborn's Map. According to the deed records, it had to be constructed by
1879.
Early maps consulted indicate that the property may have been part of the Anna Maria Baca
grant as seen on a map that depicts San Antonio as it was in 1837 (Rullman 1912) (Figure
14). Baca's property was located in the Labor de los Adaisenos. In 1773, the Spanish Crown
abandoned the presidio of Los Adaes in East Texas. The people living at the presidio were
removed to San Antonio and requested that they be given property for their homesteads and
fields. With the increase in population due to the Adaesanos coming to San Antonio, the
lands belonging to Mission Valero that were not being used were divided up amongst the

16

families arriving. Potentially, the Baca family was part of the Adaesanos that arrived in San
Antonio in 1773.

Figure 14. Map of Old San Antonio de Bexár (Rullman 1912).

17

Some of the Adaesanos had returned to East Texas the following year, but at least 60
families stayed on in San Antonio (de la Teja 1995). A portion of the project area may also
have fallen within the plot of land owned by Damian Rodriguez according to the Rullman
map.
Interesting to note, is that the four early deed records located refer to the property within the
bend of the River as Milam Place. Potentially, the property is referred to Milam's Place due
to its proximity to the Old Mill (Molino Blanco). Records indicate that Ben Milam rallied
troops and had them meet at the Old Mill prior to the Siege of Bexar on December 5, 1835.
The Old Mill was located in the bend of the San Antonio River in close proximity to the
current project area (Figure 15). Milam led troops from the Old Mill on the morning of
December 5 to encounter General Cos' men within the center of the town. The Siege lasted
until December 9, although Milam was shot by a sniper in the head on December 7 (Hall
1930; Ramsdell 1948). It is likely that people would refer to the place near the Old Mill as
Milam's Place, as that is near the location where he raised troops.

Figure 15. Map of 1835 Siege of Bexar (from Ramsdell 1948).
Koch's 1886 Bird's Eye View of San Antonio map contains the property (Figure 16). A few
structures are noted, although due to the scale of the map it is hard to determine whether it

18

was a homestead or business. No bridges crossing the San Antonio River appear to have been
constructed within the project area at this time.
In 1908, the property was conveyed to Bessie Baylor by F.F. Collins. Baylor appears to be
the daughter of John Robert Baylor who was a lieutenant Colonel commanding the Second
Texas Mounted Rifles during the Civil War. It is known that he had three daughters and
seven sons and was living in San Antonio between 1873 and 1878 (Thompson 2011). It is
likely that the Baylor Hospital was started by Bessie and was in existence until it was
converted into the Texas Mission Home and Training School.
In 1981, the deed records indicate that the changing of hands of the property is no longer for
use as a hospital or school. Rather, larger corporations appear to be dealing with the tract of
land and over the next two decades the way is paved for the construction of the new
Wyndham hotel.
Table 1. Tract 1 Property Owners.

19

Figure 16. 1886 Birds Eye view of San Antonio (Koch 1886).

Secondary Tract (Tract 2)
The earliest deed record found concerning Tract 2 dates to 1883 (Table 2). I. P. Simpson
purchased the property from Fannie Norton. Simpson appears to have been dealing in a lot of
real estate during the late half of the 1800s in San Antonio. Simpson was partner with John
Herndon James in the Simpson and James law firm which handled many cases concerning
large land holdings in western and southern Texas. James was the son of John James who
helped to resurvey Bexar County during the mid 1800s (Strong 2011). It is possible that
Norton had obtained the property as early as 1874, but an actual deed record was not located
that supported that claim. References to the 1874 date were noted in the 1883 deed.
Also similar to the Main Tract, the property appears to be part of the Baca grant as seen on
the 1912 map (see Figure 14). In addition, this tract would have also been part of the
property conveyed to George Maverick by his mother in 1872. Many of the deeds between
1901 and 1972 refer to the property as part of the Maverick Grove subdivision. The
Maverick name seems to have been given due to George Maverick owning the property in
the area. George Maverick was noted as helping to develop San Antonio (Fenstermaker
2011). By 1982, the named changed to Arden Grove Subdivision likely due to the Manion
Arden Grove Ltd. that had purchased the property.
The 1886 Bird’s Eye View map does not appear to have any structures on this plot of land
(see Figure 16). It is likely that structures were not constructed until between 1896 and
1904, as the 1896 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map does not include the area. However, the
location is developed by 1904 as part of the Maverick Grove subdivision (Figure 17).

20

The deed roles that occur after
1883 and until 1967 are typical
with a property being sold and
bought similar to in any other
residential area. In 1967, the
property was acquired by the
Arden Grove Corporation, that
indicates that the property at
that point is being treated as
commercial land. From that
point on, the property
exchanges hands through
corporations rather than
individuals. In 2007, the
property is acquired by
Paradigm Hotel which paves
the way for the construction of
the new Wyndham building.

Project Goals and Methods

Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of
data obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing and backhoe
trenching. The topics addressed were site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and
stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical framework is structured around patterns of
settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South-Central Texas region. The
historic framework is structured around the settlement along the San Antonio River as
documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests and government
representatives, through Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty, and into the Texas
Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a
systematic survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Prefield Preparation
Before the official survey began, the Principal Investigator inspected the project area with
the developer, Mr. Tim Sanford, to better understand the topography, surface visibility, and
site potential. The Project Area was clearly delineated by the San Antonio River on the west,
and by modern streets and fencelines along the north and east. The western edge of the
Project Area was defined by an old-growth tree line.

The Survey
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, 100% pedestrian survey of the two
tracts was conducted. Surface visibility ranged from 50 to 100 percent across the area. A
single shovel test and five backhoe trenches were placed in a systematic pattern across the
area (Figure 18). The sediments and soils removed from the backhoe trenches were
scrutinized by two archaeologists and a volunteer (Figure 19). All backhoe trench walls were
examined for potentially intact cultural deposits and features, and the walls were
22

photographed. The
results of shovel testing
were fully documented
on a Shovel Test form.
The shovel test was
dug in 20-cm levels,
and all sediments were
screened through 1/4inch wire mesh.
Following our designed
research plan, any
artifacts recovered
from shovel tests or
backhoe trenches were
not to be collected, but
were to be placed in
the upper 10 cm of the
backfilled shovel test
and backhoe trenches.

Results of the
Investigations

Surface Examination and
Shovel Testing
During the survey it became
readily apparent that the entire
Project Area was covered with
introduced fill of varying
depths, and was otherwise
disturbed by demolition and
riverbank construction
activities. A single shovel test
placed in Tract 2 north of
Ninth Street (see Figure 16) Figure 19. All trench backdirt was examined and sifted
revealed layered gray and through as it was removed; BHT 1, facing northeast.
yellow caliche fill to 50 centimeters below the surface (cmbs), with light green asbestos
siding fragments and rotting lumber pieces. From 50-80 cmbs, additional fill consisted of
gray, fine sandy loam with white caliche fragments.

Backhoe Trenching
Backhoe Trench 1
Backhoe Trench 1 was positioned so
to investigate the depth and width of
the San Antonio River channel prior
to it being filled in and re-channeled
in 1928 or 1929 (see Figure 18).
Based upon the profile of this 13.5meter trench, it appears that the trench
was placed in the center of the old
channel. Stratified layers of fill were
clearly evident from 0-140 cmbs,
underlain by dense gravels and
cobbles in a brown and yellowish
brown coarse sandy loam matrix to
340 cmbs. Below that, the backhoe
bucket penetrated the Trinity Frio (tf) Figure 20. Fill in upper 140 cm of BHT 1; facing west.
clay on the old river bottom. Trenching
was then terminated at 355 cmbs (Figures 20 and 21).

24

All of the artifacts retrieved from
sifting though the backdirt were
clearly within the layers of fill in the
upper 140 cm; no artifacts were
observed within the backdirt below
140 cm. Based upon their potential to
yield maker’s marks or otherwise
diagnostic attributes, selected artifacts
were singled out for closer
examination. Those artifacts from
BHT 1 singled out as unique were
washed, further examined, and
photographed. They are shown in
Figures 22 and 23.

Street Bridge in background; facing north.

Figure 22. Selected artifacts recovered from mixed contexts in BHT1 (a) Condiment bottle, (b)
square Great Western Glass Company bottle, (c) round French perfume bottle, (d) rectangular
medicinal or mineral bottle.

Shown at Figure 22a is an unbroken, round condiment bottle made from clear glass with
what is not an amethyst hue, but rather a patina surface hue resulting from exposure to
sunlight. Offset and round modern machine mold marks are very evident on it base. Double
mold seams run from its base to the top of its lip. The lip is then machine smoothed, but with
a partial vertical machine groove remaining. A maker’s mark on the base of this specimen
consists of an “O” inside a square. This unique trademark ended in 1929 when the Owens
Bottling Company merged with the Illinois Glass Company. The clarity of the glass in this
bottle suggests that it was manufactured near the very end of that merger (Toulouse 1971).
At Figure 22b is an unbroken, square, aqua colored glass bottle exhibiting heavy patina,
highly crazed, wavy mold markings. Mold seams are evident on all four corners from its base
to halfway onto its neck. It has a stopper type opening and a machine-tooled lip. The letters
“G W” in raised lettering are visible inside a raised rectangle on its base. These are most
likely the maker’s mark used between 1874-1886 by the Great Western Glass Company, St.
Louis, Missouri (Glass Manufacturers 2011).
A broken, clear glass, round bottle is shown in Figure 22c. Double mold seams extend from
from its base to its remaining upper portion. Although a slight patina is evident, there is no
26

amethyst or amber hue, and normally this attribute would suggest a post-1930 manufacturing
date if it were manufactured in the United States. However, the raised lettering on this
specimen indicates that it was manufactured for Ed Pinau perfumes in Paris, France. Edouard
Pinaud purchased a perfume business in France, and by 1840 all products were sold under
the Ed Pinaud name. Soon after the 1873 Vienna Exhibition, Pinaud became a household
name, and the company was a major exporter, especially to the United States. In 1905, the
company was renamed (Ed Pinaud Perfumes 2011). Thus, it appears that this specimen was
manufactured sometime between 1873 and 1905.
The fourth example of broken glass recovered from introduced fill in BHT 1 is a light green,
rectangular bottle base (Figure 22d). It exhibits modern, post-1903 mold seams, and has an
“N” within a square, and a “3" in raised letters on it base. The “N” in a square mark was used
by the Obear-Nester Glass Company of East St. Louis, Illinois from 1915 through at least
1971. By the 1920s, these flint green and amber bottles held among other liquids, medicinal
prescriptions and minerals (Toulouse 1971).
Other selected unique
items recovered from
introduced fill contexts
in BHT 1 are shown in
Figure 23. The first
(Figure 23a) is a
broken ceramic crock
pot top. Its decorative
brown, green, and blue
shades are a form of
banded slip, popular in
San Antonio beginning
about the last quarter of
the nineteenth century,
but can also be found
through today (Miller
1991). Three slate Figure 23. Selected items observed from introduced fill contexts in

the many items observed in the backdirt from disturbed contexts in BHT 1 (Figure 23b).
Slate ‘chalkboards” were commonly used in schools and business establishments in the
1800s and 1900s.

Backhoe Trench 2
Backhoe Trench 2 was
positioned in an
attempt to intersect the
slope of the old San
Antonio River channel
prior to it being filled
in and re-channeled
prior to 1929 (Figure
24; see also, Figure
16).

that all the artifacts

(Munsey 1971).

Backhoe Trench 3
Because of the deep and extremely
compacted overburden, a backhoe
trench (BHT 3) was used to
investigate the potential terrace
deposits to the east of the old channel
in lieu of shovel testing (Figures 26
and 27; also see Figure 16). The
backhoe trench revealed a filled
matrix to 65 cmbs, before
encountering the underlying in situ
Trinity Frio terrace soils. Although at
that point, backhoe operations were
slowed so to more closely examine Figure 26. Monitoring excavation of BHT 3; facing

material was observed. Excavations in
BHT 3 were terminate 100 cmbs.

Backhoe Trench 4
Although a shovel test was attempted
in this area, the extremely dense and
compacted overburden proved to be
impenetrable. As such, the backhoe
was brought in to remove the
overburden and further examine the in
situ subsoil. Fragmented pieces of
metal were observed in the 60 cm of
overburden, but no cultural material Figure 27. BHT 3 north wall @ 80 cmbs.
was observed in the darker, clayey
subsoils removed (Figure 28; see also, Figure 18). Excavations in BHT 3 were terminated at
120 cmbs.

Backhoe Trench 5
Based upon the obvious compacted and deep fill in this area, a backhoe was deemed the most
effective method for investigating the northeastern portion of Tract 1 (see Figure 18). As
shown in Figure 29, the overburden extended to a depth of between 60-65 cmbs. Modern
plastic and rusted metal fragments were observed in the filled matrix, but no cultural material
was observed in the carefully removed and sifted underlying in situ soils. Excavations in
BHT 5 were terminated at 125 cmbs.

Shovel Testing
As discussed above, shovel testing within the Project Area, proved to be an ineffective field
method due to the extremely thick and compacted overburden within Tract 1, nearest the
river. However, one shovel test was dug across Ninth Street, in the Tract 2 area (see Figure
18). The results of shovel testing revealed layered gray and yellow caliche sandwiched
between light grayish brown, coarse sandy loam fill between 0-50 cmbs. Numerous
fragmented pieces of light green siding fragments were found within the fill. The underlying
soil consisting of gray, fine silty between 50-80 cmbs also appeared to be introduced fill,
with white caliche fragments throughout.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
Although no intact structural remains were found during this investigation, archival research
into property ownership and structures that previously existed on the two tracts revealed
interesting information, and will contribute to our knowledge of this small area of the upper
portion of the San Antonio River, and the City of San Antonio. In this regard, we recommend
that any future development on the property include public awareness that draws attention to
the area. Examples of this could include encased items of tourist and local historian interests,
such as historic photographs and maps, along with breveted historical information.
A 100% pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the project
area was conducted, but no evidence of neither prehistoric nor historic occupation of
significance was found. Although the sediments and soils removed from extensive backhoe
trenching were carefully monitored and sifted, no prehistoric or historic materials were
observed within intact and undisturbed deposits. In addition, the single shovel test dug within
the Project Area revealed introduced fill to 80 cmbs.
In sum, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered
as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
30

Archeological Landmark program. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction, work should immediately be halted. In turn, the City of San Antonio’s
Archeologist should be contacted, and such finds should be examined and evaluated by
Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the City of San
Antonio’s Archeologist.
