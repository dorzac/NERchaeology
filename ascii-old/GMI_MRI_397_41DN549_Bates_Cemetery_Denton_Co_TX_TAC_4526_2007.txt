ABSTRACT

Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), under contract with HNTB Corporation and the city of Frisco, Texas,
conducted archeological investigations of an approximately 50-foot-x-50-foot tract (232-square
meters; 0.057-acre) in Frisco, Denton County, Texas, prior to construction of a road intersection
and underground water line. The area contains the broken historic gravestones of at least two
individuals. The grave markers indicate two brothers who died at ages 12 and 13 in the 1850s.
Archeological investigations initially consisted of confirming the presence of burials. A previous
ground-penetrating radar study of the area by A-E-I Environmental & Engineering Consultants,
Inc., was inconclusive. GMI mechanically scraped an area of approximately 50 square meters
(538 square feet; 0.012 acre) surrounding the gravestones and located two grave shafts, as well as
their original in situ fieldstones and a bed of freshwater mussel shell between the two shafts. No
additional burials were identified. The graveyard has been assigned the trinomial 41DN549.
A second phase of the investigation involved the excavation of the two burials and analysis of the
remains and artifacts. No wood had preserved; however, several nails were recovered from each
burial, indicating that the individuals had been interred in wooden containers. Artifacts were
simple and limited to machine-cut nails and tacks from the burial containers and buttons from the
clothing. Osteologically, the skeletons conformed to the ages on the gravestones; however, sex
could not be assessed due to the young ages of the individuals. The two skeletons shared several
biological anomalies that suggests a genetic relationship and further supports the information
provided on the gravestones. Both individuals experienced at least one episode of significant
biological stress in early childhood; however, neither indicated later nutritional deprivation. One
burial left no other pathological indicators of illness or injury, and cause of death is unknown.
The other demonstrated skeletal lesions consistent with a chronic pulmonary infection that was
likely the cause of the individual’s death.
A living relative of the two boys has been identified, and she has requested that they be re-buried
in Oak Grove Cemetery in Denton County with other family members. All human remains and
recovered artifacts will be re-interred. Photographs, field notes, analysis forms, and all other
documentation of the burials will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

HNTB Corporation, an engineering and planning firm, and the city of Frisco, Texas, are planning
to construct a water line and an intersection that will connect Legacy Drive with Panther Creek
Parkway (CR 1043) in the western portion of Frisco, Denton County, Texas, north of Eldorado
Parkway (FM 2934) and west of Dallas Parkway (Figure 1). In compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas, Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), was contracted to investigate an approximately 50-feet
(ft)-x-50-ft (232 square [sq] meter [m]; 2,500 sq ft) section in the southeast quadrant of the
proposed intersection where two broken but complete marble headstones and several marble
footstone fragments were located (Figure 2).
The area of investigation is located on level terrain southeast of two intersecting barbed wire
fences lined with hackberry trees (Figure 3). Cultivated wheat fields flank the project area to the
east and west, while the property north of the project area is pasture for grazing livestock. The
investigated area was located inside the tree lines and was overgrown with grasses, poison ivy,
vines, and hackberry saplings. The lower portions of the two headstones, consisting of the
bottom part of a broken tablet stone mounted onto a larger stone base, are spaced approximately
30 centimeters (cm; 12 inches [in]) apart. The northern headstone base is approximately 3 m
(10 ft) south of the north fence (Figure 4). The remaining portions of the gravestones that bear
most of the inscription have been placed a short distance (<1 m) northwest of the bases. The
headstones are identical in style and both exhibit a resting lamb design within a semicircle at the
top of the stone (Figures 5 and 6). Gravestone inscriptions commemorate two adolescent sons of
W. E. and Susan Bates—James Marshall and George Wright—who died, respectively, in 1853
and 1858. An epitaph is inscribed near the bottom of each tablet, but neither is legible. Each
tablet is broken in two places, and cement along the edges of the breaks indicates previous
attempts to repair the stones (Figure 7). A few footstone fragments, including one with the
initials “J. M. B” have been stacked on the headstone bases. The west fence has collapsed along
the northern 30 m, but trees still define the property line, which is approximately 6.5 m west of
the bases.
The archeological investigation was conducted in two phases. The first phase was to confirm that
human burials were, indeed, present within the proposed construction right-of-way (GMI project
number 30007.07.01). Once all burials were identified, a second phase was undertaken in which
the remains and associated artifacts were archeologically removed and later analyzed (GMI

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project area is located in extreme eastcentral Denton County along level uplands at an
elevation of 650 ft above sea level between Panther Creek and Cottonwood Branch. The main
channel of Panther Creek flows 2.3 kilometers (km; 1.5 miles [mi]) to the north of the project
area, although an intermittent tributary is about 400 m north of the project area. The main
channel of Cottonwood Branch occurs 2.2 km (1.3 mi) south of the project area. Both streams
flow into Lewisville Lake, which is approximately 6.4 km (4 mi) west of the project area.
Lewisville Lake, originally Lake Dallas, was constructed on the Elm Fork of the Trinity River to
control potential floodwaters originating from its drainage basin (Handbook of Texas Online
2001). Denton County falls within Blair’s (1950:100–102) Texan biotic province. Yates and
Ferring (1986:22) explain that the Texan province is not so much a distinct geographic unit as it
is a large ecotone, in which species from both the forests to the east and the grasslands to the west
overlap at the limits of their ranges. Complete listings of the faunal resources of the upper Trinity
River basin can be found elsewhere (Yates and Ferring 1986:12–31); however, the region as a
whole is characterized by high species diversity (Yates and Ferring 1986:22). The project area is
located within the Blackland Prairie, which is characterized by black, calcareous clay soils and by
a dominance of grasses, with shrubs and trees present along stream bottoms and flood plains
(McMahan et al. 1984; Yates and Ferring 1986:17).
The region has a warm temperate, subtropical, and humid climate that is generally mild, with
periods of extremely hot and cold weather being limited in duration. Yearly rainfall is fairly
evenly distributed, with the maximum rainfall occurring in April and May and the minimum in
August. Much of the rainfall occurs in the form of heavy thunderstorms, with the rapid runoff
allowing only limited absorption of water by the soil. Snowfall is rare, with an average of less
than 2.5 cm (1 in) falling per year. The snowfall is generally present for less than one week. The
prevailing winds are southerly. Temperatures remain above 0°Celsius (32°F) approximately 240
days each year (Ford and Pauls 1980).
Geologically, the project area is underlain by undifferentiated Quaternary surficial deposits of
sand, clay, silt, and gravel colluvium and minor alluvium (McGowen et al. 1967[1991]). The
surface soil is mapped as Branyon clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes (Ford and Pauls 1980). The
Branyon series consists of deep, clayey soils on uplands formed in filled valleys or ancient
terraces of calcareous, clayey sediments. A typical soil profile consists of 142 cm (56 in) of dark
9

gray (10YR 4/1), calcareous, moderately alkaline clay with few calcium carbonate concretions
above gray (10YR 5/1) calcareous, moderately alkaline clay. Few yellowish brown mottles occur
and calcium carbonate concretions are common.

ARCHEOLOGICAL AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
Although the chronological framework for the upper Trinity River basin is not well developed,
the available data allow the delineation of a generalized chronology (Table 1). Investigations at
Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have provided evidence for a refinement of the
chronology for the Late Prehistoric period, but the overall regional applicability of the phases
recognized at Joe Pool Lake remains to be demonstrated. Prikryl (1987) has presented a
chronological sequence of six periods. Unfortunately, his sequence relies almost totally on
diagnostic artifacts from surface contexts and comparisons to dated contexts distant from the
upper Trinity River basin. The generalized chronology presented here reflects the present state of
knowledge as interpreted from the Joe Pool Lake investigations. A brief summary of the
adaptations associated with these periods is presented below.

A.D. 1600–A.D. 1800

The Paleo-Indian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or stratigraphically mixed contexts. The
Field Ranch site (Jensen 1968) along the upper Elm Fork is a primary example of typical site
contexts. Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks
in the Cross Timbers. The Lewisville Lake site (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961) is the bestknown Paleo-Indian site within the region. While the original radiocarbon dates (ca. 37,000 B.P.)
11

contributed to the significance of the site, more recent work (Stanford 1981) has resolved the
controversy concerning the date of the occupation. It appears that the presence of naturally
occurring lignite, as either a fuel in these hearths or as an inadvertent inclusion, contaminated the
radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually accepted date of 12,000–10,000 years ago for
Clovis-period occupations is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human occupation of
Northcentral Texas.
Our knowledge of the settlement-subsistence strategies used by these early occupants is
extremely limited. However, excavation at the Aubrey site, a well-preserved Clovis period site in
Denton County, has indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big game animals alone;
rather, the entire range of prairie and forest species were used (Ferring 1989). Whether this
pattern of a more generalized foraging subsistence system is characteristic of Clovis adaptations
in the Eastern Woodlands and the focus on now extinct, big game species is more characteristic
of a Plains adaptation remains to be documented.
An understanding of the Archaic period in the upper Trinity River drainage is limited by the lack
of data from major excavations. This is particularly true for the Early and Middle Archaic
periods. Investigations along the West Fork (Peter and McGregor 1988; Yates and Ferring 1986)
indicate that primary contexts for Early and Middle Archaic sites will be found deeply buried
within flood plain alluvium. Artifacts from these periods are found on terrace surfaces, but they
are frequently mixed with later materials. In fact, the initial treatment of the Archaic period
(Crook and Harris 1952, 1954), which defined the Carrollton and Elam foci, was based upon
materials from such terrace contexts. Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer
recognized as acceptable for Northcentral Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates
and Ferring 1986).
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and at Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and
Yates 1997; Lebo 1995a; Skinner and Baird 1985) indicate that the Late Archaic period is
characterized by assemblages left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied
a site for a limited time period and then moved to another location. These sites were apparently
reoccupied numerous times on a seasonal basis. Deer and numerous small mammals were the
primary food resources. The documentation of large pits associated with Late Archaic period
sites in the Richland/Chambers Creek drainage (Bruseth and Martin 1987) suggests that important
sociopolitical changes may have occurred during this time period. Unfortunately, the significance
of these pits remains an enigma despite their excellent documentation.
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period in the upper Trinity River basin is marked by the
initial appearance of arrow points. The date of A.D. 700 for this period is based upon dated
contexts to the west in the Brazos River drainage. Lynott (1977) suggests that the Late
Prehistoric period may be divided into an early and late phase. The early phase is characterized
by sand and grog-tempered ceramics, Scallorn and Alba arrow points, and a continuation of the
foraging subsistence system of the Late Archaic period. The late phase reflects a Southern Plains
influence with the appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus, various
unstemmed triangular points (e.g., Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point. Evidence of
horticulture and the procurement of bison also appears in sites of this period (Harris and Harris
1970; Morris and Morris 1970). Prikryl’s (1987) more recent assessment of the Late Prehistoric
period largely follows that of Lynott (1977).

12

Investigations of the Cobb-Pool site at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) have resulted in
a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site yielded house structures,
roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules. Radiocarbon dates
from several features indicate that the site was occupied during the late twelfth or early thirteenth
century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive Caddoan
occupation. Consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred during a
middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that ceramics were not introduced to
the region before this time.
Whether the Cobb-Pool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive
change separate from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however,
analysis of a Native American burial salvaged along Spring Creek (site 41DL373) in northeastern
Dallas County also suggests maize consumption. The individual was a female around 50 years
old. Radiocarbon dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155–1275, while a
carbon isotope ratio of -17.7‰ suggests that maize was consumed, but it did not form a major
part of her diet (Peter and Clow 2000). These indications of maize consumption contrast with a
small grouping of disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369) in
Dallas County. This site, located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity
River), yielded remains of at least four individuals radiocarbon dated from bone collagen to circa
A.D. 1010–1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although shell beads and a shell
gorget were present. A carbon isotope ratio of -21.6‰ suggests that the group’s diet was not high
in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given the slightly earlier date of the Harbor Pointe burials compared
to Cobb-Pool and 41DL373, it is possible that maize agriculture was introduced to the Dallas area
around A.D. 1200. Conversely, this same evidence may indicate that groups in the Dallas area
practiced divergent subsistence patterns.
Historical documentation and archeological evidence are very sparse for the Protohistoric period
in the upper Trinity River basin. Tonkawa, Wichita, Caddo, and Comanche all are likely to have
traversed the area. However, exact locations of their sites and detailed ethnohistoric data are
almost nonexistent. Although European trade items appear on a limited number of sites
(Sollberger 1953), no Protohistoric site has been thoroughly investigated, and characterizations of
the Native American adaptations during this time period are conjectural at best. A lack of
documentary evidence, together with a lack of interest among ethnologists and archeologists, has
contributed to this situation.

HISTORIC OCCUPATION/UTILIZATION
The first presence of Europeans in Northcentral Texas may have occurred in 1542 when the
remnants of the de Soto expedition, led by Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado, entered the area in an
effort to find a land route to New Spain. Some researchers believe that the expedition crossed
Northcentral Texas (Lebo and Brown 1990:61), although others place the route much farther to
the east and south (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1991; Chipman 1992; Hudson 1986; Schambach 1989;
Weber 1992). A consistent European presence in the region did not occur until the early 1700s,
when French traders from Louisiana began to move west along the Red River. The Spanish
considered this French incursion to be a threat to the security of New Spain, and they responded
by redoubling efforts to counterbalance the French influence with the Native Americans in East
and Northcentral Texas. These efforts continued until 1763, when France ceded Louisiana to
Spain under the Treaty of Paris. This reduced the perceived threat to the security of New Spain
13

and resulted in a reduction of Spanish investment in eastern and northern Texas. More important
from the Native American viewpoint was the severe military defeat inflicted on the Spanish by
the Wichita and allied tribes at Spanish Fort on the Red River in 1758. It has been argued that
this defeat put an end to Spanish military and missionary expansion to the north (Weddle 1964,
1965).
The first European Americans to settle in the region settled along the Trinity River and its
tributaries as the frontier grew westward. The earliest of these settlements, at present-day Pilot
Point and Little Elm, occurred near the southeast corner of what later became Denton County
(Denton County History Page 2001). The area remained largely unsettled until 1841 when
people, primarily from the upper southern states, were drawn there by a land grant, known as the
Peters Colony. William S. Peters and the Texas Emigration and Land Company obtained the first
land contract in 1841 to populate the newly formed Republic of Texas. Over time, Texas
Emigration and Land Company obtained three additional land contracts, and the land grant
encompassed most of Northcentral Texas, including present-day Denton and Collin counties—
then part of Fannin County. Texas was annexed by the United States in 1846, and Denton
County was established by the state legislature the same year (Lebo 1990; Odom 2001). The
population further increased during this time because the presence of federal troops promised
greater protection against potential raids by hostile Native Americans (Denton County History
Page 2001). Within the first few years after Denton County’s creation, the county seat moved
three times, and Denton eventually became the permanent seat in 1856 (Lebo 1990; Odom 2001).
Following the presidential election of 1860, Texas, in common with the rest of the South, began
to consider secession. Denton County voted 331 to 256 in favor of this action, and large numbers
of its men volunteered to serve with the Confederate Army. Although the fighting never reached
Northcentral Texas, the Civil War still inflicted hardships on the region (WPA 1992:55–58).
Because most able-bodied men were away fighting for the Confederacy, most small towns and
villages were left unprotected and fearful of Native American raids (Denton County History Page
2001). The result was an eastward retreat of the frontier. The region also gradually became
impoverished by the war as food and other commodities became expensive and difficult to obtain
(WPA 1992:55–58).
Although the region suffered economically in the aftermath of the Civil War, it was not as badly
affected as other areas of the former Confederacy. This greater economic vitality was fueled in
part by streams of immigrants from the rest of the country, who were hoping to make a fresh start
in the as yet unsettled West. Other elements in the economy included the nearby presence of one
of the cattle trails to Kansas and Dallas’s role as a center of the buffalo hide market (WPA
1992:60–70). The presence of railroads into Denton County by the 1880s resulted in a shift in the
county economy. Prior to this time, most farming was subsistence-based, although cattle and
horse ranching had become an important industry. After the introduction of the railroad, cotton
and wheat production were the major forms of agriculture (Odom 2001). Nevertheless, by 1910
over 60 percent of farmers in Denton County were tenants (Green 1977:Table 8.16), many of
whom were trapped in a cycle of debt to the landowners (Ferring and Reese 1982).
Rural populations began to decline during the 1930s under the impetus of poor climatic
conditions, hard times, the decreased importance of cotton as a cash crop, and the increasing level
of mechanization in agriculture (Lebo 1995b). Much of the present economy is based on two
large state-supported universities established in the city of Denton near the turn of the twentieth
century. In addition, several cities in Denton County, particularly the southeastern portion, have
developed into suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex (Odom 2001).

THE W. E. BATES FAMILY
The father of the two individuals listed on the gravestones was the Reverend William Edmunds
Bates, a circuit minister credited with establishing several Methodist churches in Denton County.
William E. Bates was born 1812, in Amherst County, Virginia (Bates 1989[1918]). His
gravestone indicates a birth date of October 12 (Blair n.d.). He moved to Barren County,
Kentucky, in 1820, and married Susan Wright (born January 1, 1816) on November 3, 1834
(Bates 1989[1918]). The couple had 10 children (Texas State Historical Survey Committee
1973). In 1843, he was licensed by the Methodist Church to preach, and in 1851, he and his
family moved to Denton County, Texas, with three other families. W. P. Bates, a son of
Reverend Bates, recalled that the family first shared a rented log house with another family in the
southeast corner of Denton County near present-day Hebron, and moved to Little Elm in 1852. In
the fall of 1853, the family lived in the Bethel schoolhouse for two months while a house on
Panther Creek near the east county line was constructed. Reverend Bates actively served the
Methodist Church until 1868 (Bates 1989[1918]). He died April 25, 1883, and was buried in Oak
Grove Cemetery, approximately 10 miles east of Denton. His wife, Susan Wright Bates, died
November 16, 1897, and was also buried in Oak Grove Cemetery (Bates 1989[1918]; Blair, n.d.).
Although the two boys, James Marshall and George Wright, were buried by themselves in a small
graveyard in the 1850s, at least four of William and Susan Bates’s children, who survived to
adulthood, are buried in Oak Grove Cemetery, most with spouses and children (Bates
1989[1918]; Blair n.d.). Living descendants no longer reside in the area; however, the family
shares a prominent history in Denton County affairs (Bates 1989[1918]).

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Four major reports concerning the archeology of the upper Trinity River basin (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987, 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986) aptly summarize the history of
archeological investigations within the upper Trinity River drainage and the cultural-historical
framework for the area. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archeologists have resulted in the recording of numerous sites, it is apparent that much research
remains to be done. As noted by McGregor (1988:27–29), much of the excavation effort within
the upper Trinity River basin has focused on reservoir development, especially along the Elm
Fork (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961; Skinner and Baird 1985; Skinner et al. 1982) and the
East Fork (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Lynott 1975; Ross 1966).
Field school excavations by the University of Texas at Arlington at the Northlake site on
Grapevine Creek were also reported in the mid-1970s (Morgan 1975).
Extensive archeological investigations have been undertaken as a result of the construction of
Lewisville Lake (formerly known as Lake Dallas and Garza-Little Elm Reservoir) and Ray
Roberts Lake (formerly known as Aubrey Reservoir). Lewisville Lake has been expanded
several times as the population of the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex has grown, with its earliest
incarnation, Lake Dallas, existing prior to 1936. Archeological investigations for Lewisville
Lake began in 1948 when the River Basin Survey (RBS) investigated the proposed reservoir area.
A total of 27 sites was found during this survey, 14 of which had been previously recorded by
members of the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS; Stephenson 1949, 1950). Three sites,
Ledbetter (41DN5), Lake Dallas (41DN6), and Bob Pierce (41DN12), were tested by the RBS in
1951, although the results have never been reported (Prikryl 1987). During and after the RBS
investigation, members of DAS continued to investigate the Lewisville Lake area (Barber 1966,
15

1969; Harris 1950, 1951a, 1951b). The major result of this work was the discovery and
investigation of the Lewisville site (41DN72), a purported pre-Clovis occupation (Crook 1964;
Crook and Harris 1956, 1957, 1958, 1961). Radiocarbon dates of 37,000 B.P. created
considerable controversy in the archeological community until 1979–1980, when lowered lake
levels allowed reinvestigation of the site by the Smithsonian Institution (Stanford 1981). Further
enlargements of Lewisville Lake prompted surveys by the Richland Archeological Society in
1973 (Nunley 1973) and North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas
[UNT]) in 1986 (Lebo and Brown 1990). This was followed by test excavations (Brown and
Lebo 1991) and mitigation (Ferring and Yates 1998; Lebo 1995b) of selected sites.
Archeological investigations at Ray Roberts Lake began in the early 1970s with a survey
conducted by Southern Methodist University (Bousman and Verrett 1973), which recorded 26
sites (25 prehistoric, one historic). During 1980–1981, additional survey, as well as testing and
mitigation, was undertaken by Environmental Consultants, Inc. (ECI; Cliff et al. 1982), which
recorded 355 sites with 117 prehistoric components. Following the survey, additional
investigations were undertaken at 60 sites (Skinner et al. 1982), which were followed by intensive
excavation at 12 sites, oral interviews for 17 historic sites, and architectural recording at 13 sites
(Skinner and Baird 1985). Finally, in 1986 UNT began further survey, test excavations, and
mitigation efforts within the area to be impacted by construction of Ray Roberts Lake (Ferring
and Yates 1997; Lebo 1992, 1995a, 1996; Prikryl and Yates 1987).
Many small cultural resources management projects have been conducted in and near Denton
County. In 1988, Martin conducted a survey of proposed highway improvements along Interstate
35W in Denton and Tarrant counties (Martin 1988). In 1989, UNT surveyed Hickory Creek Park
for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, resulting in the location of one historic site (Lebo 1989).
In 1991, Mariah Associates, Inc., did a reconnaissance of proposed sewer line improvements for
the city of Argyle (Kibler 1991). During late 1991, Austin and Peter (1992) performed a
pedestrian survey of proposed improvements at North Lakes Park in the city of Denton. In 1992,
Corbin undertook a survey of the proposed Northpointe Park for the city of The Colony (Corbin
1992). During 1993, AR Consultants surveyed the proposed 28-acre Highland Village
Community Park (Skinner 1993). In the same year, Green and Peter surveyed the proposed South
Lakes Park for the city of Denton (Peter and Green 1993). In 1995, Ferring undertook a survey of
125 acres adjacent to the Lewisville Lake dam (Ferring 1995). A pedestrian survey of
approximately 8 acres belonging to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers near Grapevine Lake was
conducted by SWCA, Inc. (Miller 1995). Also in 1995, the University of Texas at Austin
conducted a survey of an 800-acre tract along Timber Creek. One prehistoric site was located but
was considered to contain no significant deposits (Carpenter 1995). During late 1994 and early
1995, Hicks & Company performed a pedestrian survey for a 160-acre expansion of the city of
Denton landfill, resulting in the identification of one historic site (Treece et al. 1995). A 1996
pedestrian survey of the Arbor Hills Nature Preserve by AR Consultants resulted in the location
of one historic site (Skinner and Whorton 1996). Again in 1996, AR Consultants surveyed the
Prairie Creek Interceptor for the city of Lewisville (Trask et al. 1996). AR Consultants also
conducted a survey that same year for an extension of the Dallas North Tollway between SH 121
and U.S. 380, west of Frisco (Skinner 1996). In the winter of 1996–1997, AR Consultants
surveyed the proposed FM 2499 at Lewisville Lake (Skinner 1997). Early in 1997, Espey,
Huston & Associates, Inc., undertook the survey of the Kirkwood Branch Interceptor for the
Trinity River Authority (Tate 1997).
In 2001, GMI conducted archeological and
geoarcheological investigations of 15 acres along Timber Creek in Lewisville, Texas. Two
prehistoric sites were identified, but they were considered ineligible for inclusion in the National
16

Register (Cooper et al. 2001). GMI conducted an archeological survey of 83 acres for a proposed
wastewater treatment plant in Frisco, Texas, 2.6 km (1.6 mi) northwest of the present project area.
Two archeological sites were identified, although neither was eligible for National Register
listing (Tiné 2002).
Most recently, in 2006, AR Consultants, teamed with GMI, discovered and removed two human
burials from a historic family cemetery (Sonntag Cemetery; 41COL185) in the Collin County
portion of Frisco along the proposed extension of the North Dallas Tollway between SH 121 and
U.S. 380, approximately 7.5 km (5 mi) southeast of the current project area (Tiné et al. 2007).
The burials in the cemetery were presumably moved in 1974, and the Sonntag family sold the
property after the cemetery dedication had been removed. As a consequence, the investigators
who conducted the 1996 survey and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) agreed that no
further archeological investigation of the cemetery location was necessary. However, shortly
prior to construction of the North Dallas Tollway extension, an amateur genealogist obtained
family records that indicated that a relative, who was a stillbirth, had been buried in that cemetery
in 1902. After the information was brought to the attention of the North Texas Tollway Authority
and the THC, archeological investigations identified an undisturbed grave shaft of a small
individual near a disturbed area from where the other burials had presumably been removed. The
grave contained a modestly adorned infant-size coffin and remains from a neonate to six-monthold individual. Investigation of the disturbed area resulted in the discovery of a second burial.
Analysis of the remains and associated artifacts indicated a male adolescent who was buried
during the first to second decade of the 1900s.
Specific to the current project, A-E-I Environmental & Engineering Consultants, Inc., conducted
a noninvasive study of the present project area in 2004 with ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to
determine if human burials were indeed present in the location of two broken headstones where
the city of Frisco had planned to construct a water line and intersection (A-E-I 2004). No
subsurface anomalies were identified in the area of the headstones, although the investigators
noted a disturbance potentially consistent with a grave shaft approximately 3.3 m (10 ft) south of
the headstones near a broken footstone. The inconclusive results of the GPR study prompted the
present investigation.

CHAPTER 4
BURIAL IDENTIFICATION

Although two headstones and apparently associated footstones occupied the project area, the
placement of the headstone bases on top of the ground surface, rather than imbedded, and the
broken condition of the stones left open the possibility that they had been moved or discarded.
However, a small cemetery is plotted on a USGS topographic map in the location of the grave
markers (see Figure 1). The presence of this feature on the map indicates that the stones have
been in this location at least since it was initially field-checked in 1960. Presumably, some
rationale other than the mere presence of the stones (e.g., a fence or some other indicator of
contextual integrity) merited designation of the space as a cemetery on the map. The limited
amount of available information about the cemetery is inconsistent and speculative. Other than
the simplest explanation—that the area represents a small graveyard for at least two individuals—
two other scenarios have been postulated. Although, no source or basis for these suggestions has
been offered, one possibility listed is that five burials constituted the cemetery (Denton County,
GenWeb Project 1999). This scenario is reasonable because many historic burials were not
marked, others were not marked with an object that is a universally recognizable indicator of a
human burial, and other markers are either destroyed or moved over time. Yet the five possible
individuals are described as “[A]n elderly man, elderly woman, young man and two little boys”
(Denton County, GenWeb Project 1999). None of these individuals demographically matches the
two adolescent boys listed on the existing gravestones if the description of the two boys is
literally interpreted.
Another speculation offered about the headstones is that they mark the original burial place of the
two Bates boys. However, it was postulated that they had been moved to Oak Grove Cemetery,
where their parents and other family members are buried (Denton County, GenWeb Project
1999). Nevertheless, a transcription of gravestones at Oak Grove Cemetery does not list either of
the boys’ names. Their parents, the Reverend William Edmunds Bates and Susan Bates, and two
brothers, the Reverend Eugene T. Bates and Alexander Tullis Bates, however, are listed (Blair
n.d.).
As discussed in Chapter 3, a previous attempt to identify human burials through GPR analysis
was not conclusive and did not help resolve the questions surrounding the gravestones and
possible cemetery. Consequently, GMI was hired to confirm the presence of burials through the
more direct, although invasive, method of subsurface excavation. A human osteologist
19

experienced in burial identification monitored a Gradall as the machine gradually scraped away
thin (2–5 cm; 1–2 in) layers of soil. In most instances, the outline of a historic grave shaft can be
identified as a rectangular stain in the soil. The discoloration is the result of mixing the different
layers of soil as the grave is backfilled. Factors such as the thickness or contrast in the color and
composition of the soil strata influence the effectiveness of this method. Under some
circumstances, particularly when the natural soil is heavily disturbed or the thickness of the
surface layer exceeds the depth of the grave, it is necessary to gradually scrape until the burial
container or actual human remains are encountered. Scraping in an area ceases when either
excavation into the natural soil reaches a depth that is improbable for a human burial or, more
commonly, when a strongly enough contrasting layer of soil in which a disturbance would be
visible is encountered. Within the investigated area, thickness of the soil layers varied and
maximum depth of excavation ranged from 65 cm (21 in) below ground surface (bs) to 155 cm
(61 in) bs before a contrasting soil stratum was observed. Nevertheless, the soil stratigraphy
pattern was generally consistent with regard to color and texture throughout the project area. The
soil profile generally consisted of an 80-cm (31.5-in) surface layer of very dark gray (10YR 3/1)
to black (10YR 2/1) clay with calcium carbonate concretions, followed by 20 cm (8 in) of dark
brown (10YR 3/3) clay with calcium carbonate concretions. Usually, between 100 cm (37 in)
and 110 cm (43 in) bs, a dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) clay with common limestone and
calcium carbonate concretions was observed and provided a sufficient contrast to the upper strata
to confirm the absence of burials.
For this particular project, the rationale was to first investigate the area immediate to the
gravestones and expand the excavation away as necessary. Some modification of this protocol
was required, however, to allow the Gradall to maneuver around large trees and efficiently
deposit dirt so that repeated backfilling would not be necessary. As a result, scraping was
initiated from as close to the intersection of the tree/fence lines northwest of the gravestones as
the machine could reach, scraping toward the gravestones. A large, thin, irregular-shaped slab of
extremely sandy, low-quality concrete was uncovered directly below the ground surface
approximately 3 m (10 ft) west of the two headstone bases (Figure 8). It was concluded that the
concrete had no relation to the gravestones. Overhead utility lines extend along the west tree line,
and the concrete was probably mixed to stabilize one or more of the utility poles but discarded
because of its poor quality. As scraping continued, however, a slab of sandstone was exposed,
also immediately below the ground surface, 2.5–3 m (8–10 ft) west of the concrete (Figure 9; see
Figure 3). The stone measured 36 cm (14 in) by 39 cm (15 in) and was about 2 cm (0.8 in) thick.
Two edges were fairly straight, and lines have been etched into one to the flat surfaces in what
appears to be the form of one or two crosses (Figure 10). The slab most likely represents a large
fragment of a fieldstone or crudely made headstone. However, no burials were identified in the
immediate area of the fieldstone and none were observed in the areas west and northwest of the
gravestone bases.
As excavation proceeded east toward the two gravestone bases, it was necessary to remove the
gravestone tablet fragments that were lying on the ground. These were photographed in place and
mapped prior to moving. Two upright, roughly rectangular pieces of sandstone in a north-tosouth alignment were uncovered directly below the ground surface 67 cm (26 in) west of the
northern headstone base (Figure 11; see Figure 3). The upper portion of each stone was broken
nearly flush with the ground surface, and the stones were the same material as the fieldstone
fragment exposed to the west. Several pieces of this type of stone were observed on the plowed
surface of the eastern wheat field, indicating that the stone is indigenous to the area. Considering
the early death dates inscribed on the marble markers, it is highly probable that the graves were

originally marked with a locally available material. The manufactured marble stones, no doubt,
replaced the fieldstones several years later when the area became less remote and such items were
more readily accessible. It is also possible that family members were not able to afford
professionally made gravestones, or at least their transport, in the 1850s.
Several large freshwater mussel shells were also observed between and immediately east of the
two fieldstones (see Figure 11). The exterior surface of nearly all of the shells faced up,
suggesting a purposeful arrangement. Shells are common grave decorations in Texas and other
southern, particularly coastal, states (Jordan 1982:18–19). They are also often symbolic in a
mortuary context, and for many belief systems, shells—particularly bivalves—frequently signify
birth, the journey through life, resurrection, and everlasting life. Though scallop shells are a more
typical mortuary symbol, freshwater mussels would have been a locally available material to
convey this message.
Further excavation indicated that no burials were present between the north fence and the
gravestones. When scraping continued along the east side of the gravestones, the machine
exposed an in situ fragment of a marble footstone 67 cm (26 in) east of the northern headstone
base (Figure 12). By this point, there was little doubt that the gravestones did indeed mark two
burials, and scraping proceeded to the east and south of the grave markers to determine if others
had also been buried in this area. A water hydrant in the adjacent field (see Figure 2) that
schematic drawings indicated was the southern boundary of the construction right-of-way defined
the southern extent of excavation. Remnants of a third barbed wire fence extended south of the
northern fence approximately 11 m (36 ft) east of the western fence and tree line. Two standing
wooden posts are recent and one fallen wooden post appears to be somewhat older. However, a
bois d’arc fence post (Figure 13) was roughly aligned with the other posts, and suggests that a
fence had existed in this area for several years, and that it possibly represents part of an early
enclosure for the burials. The physical obstacle of several large trees in this area frequently
prevented excavation farther east than the line of fence posts. Nevertheless, no additional burials
were observed between the extant grave markers and the fence line.
An area of approximately 50 sq m (538 sq ft; 0.012 acre) was scraped between the three fence
lines and the southern construction right-of-way boundary around the area defined by the in situ
stones, and no other burials were identified (Figure 14). The presence of large trees (see Figure
2) explains the irregular configuration of the excavation limits. The location of the anomaly
identified by A-E-I in 2004 was examined. No evidence of a burial shaft was identified in this
location, and the base of an adjacent fallen tree suggests that the subsurface anomaly was a
depression caused when the tree uprooted. The pedestalled area around the grave markers,
however, indicated two grave shafts in alignment with the fieldstones (Figure 15). The southern
shaft, the most easily identifiable shaft, was readily visible as a column of contrasting lightercolored, mottled clay with numerous calcium carbonate concretions. The northern shaft had been
obscured from the Gradall scraping at the corner of the pedestalled area. Nevertheless, areas of
the same type of contrasting clay as the southern shaft were visible against the undisturbed nearly
black clay. The two marble headstone bases straddled the southern shaft, indicating that although
they were not perfectly matched with the graves, they were in close approximation.
Project schedules required that the burials be removed as soon as possible. Therefore, burial
excavation was planned to take place the following day and the remainder of the workday was
spent mechanically removing overburden to the level of the actual interred individuals to expedite
burial removal. It was first necessary to remove the fieldstones, gravestone bases, and in situ

footstone base. Prior to removal, they were photographed in place and mapped. All gravestones
were sufficiently lightweight that one to two people could easily move them. The ground surface
was also hand-scraped with a trowel to determine if any additional shell or possible “grave
offerings” were present. All shell was collected, and several objects were recovered from the
ground surface or immediately beneath it. These include a metal button embossed with the letters
“S.K.,” two ceramic fragments, small fragments of bottle and window glass, pieces of rusted tin
or sheet metal, and a metal food tin key with a strip of metal wrapped around the base. Jordan
(1982) notes that burials in Texas and other southern states can often be decorated with unusual
objects, many of which hold personal significance. However, the burials are surrounded by
agricultural property, and the plethora of shotgun shells around the eastern field identifies it as a
well-utilized bird hunting location. Based on the amount of human traffic in the area, the objects
more likely represent incidentally discarded items. Once all surface materials had been collected,
mechanical excavation continued until the interred remains were encountered.
The tree/fence lines, limits of excavation, and archeological features, including gravestones and
burial shafts, were mapped with a Trimble Pro XRS Global Positioning System (GPS) device. A
datum, also mapped with the GPS, was established at the highest point of original ground surface
to serve as a control for vertical measurements. A site form was submitted to the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the cemetery has been assigned the trinomial
41DN549.

CHAPTER 5
EXCAVATION AND ANALYSIS METHODS

BURIAL REMOVAL
The burials were removed through a combination of machine and hand excavation. After the
headstones, fieldstones, and burials shafts had been mapped and photographed, the identified
gravestones and shells were removed, and the Gradall removed the overburden. The profiles of
the burial shafts indicated that they extended below the floor of the excavated area. Therefore,
once excavation reached the floor, the machine gradually scraped the area of the shafts in thin 2–
5-cm (1–2-in) layers to get to the level of the interments. Typically, wood, nails, or a piece of
funerary hardware will be exposed prior to any remains. However, no wood was preserved in
either burial, and both were identified when the machine exposed skeletal elements including, but
not limited to, the skull. A few nails were also uncovered near the foot of the northern burial
(Burial 1), and this indicated that a wooden burial container had once been present. The remains
were exposed near the end of the workday. Therefore, the skulls were mapped with a GPS
device, and the two graves were covered with a plastic tarp.
The following day, the project osteologist and a field assistant proceeded with the hand
excavations using small tools and brushes. Once the skeleton was completely exposed, it was
fully documented, and the remains and artifacts were removed. A shade was erected over the
burials to protect both the skeletal remains and the excavators from the sun and to prevent the
clay soil from rapidly drying. Likewise, the portions of the burials not being excavated remained
covered by the tarp to protect them from the elements and to conceal them from immediate view.
By the time the second burial was being excavated, weather conditions turned rainy, and the tarp
and canopy helped keep the burial dry. When the burials were initially exposed, rain had been
forecasted for later in the week, and the Gradall operator excavated a small trench for drainage
west of the burials.
Field documentation involved digital photographs of the top of the burial; the fully exposed
skeleton; and segments of the skeleton, usually the cranial area, thorax area, pelvic area, and leg
and/or foot area. In addition, the excavators filled out an excavation form (Appendix A) that
documented soil color and consistency; burial orientation; below surface depth of the burial
measured from a datum; dimensions of the burial shaft and container; container shape and
material; presence and location of associated artifacts; disposition, condition, and position of the
27

skeletal remains; and any other noteworthy features. A sketch of the burial container and
skeleton demonstrating skeletal position, artifact location, disturbances, and other pertinent
descriptive and provenience information was included on each burial form. Preliminary
observations about demography and pathology were also recorded.
A method similar to the one used by the Arkansas Archeological Survey at the Cedar Grove
Cemetery (Rose 1985) was employed. The burial was divided into five excavation zones
consisting of the cranial area, upper right and left, and lower right and left. Upper and lower were
defined as being superior or inferior, respectively, to the superior-most portion of the pelvis.
Skeletal elements or segments were bagged individually and labeled according to anatomical
location. Artifacts were bagged and labeled according to excavation zone.

BIOARCHEOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS
Following their removal, the remains and associations were processed at the GMI laboratory.
This process included cleaning the bones and artifacts, a thorough osteological examination of the
human remains, an analysis of the associated artifacts, and a photographic documentation of the
remains and artifacts. Most of the materials could be cleaned by gently removing the dried clay
with a toothbrush or paintbrush. However, some bones, particularly those that had become
muddy from the rain, required washing. This was accomplished by splashing as little water as
possible on the bones to remove the dirt. Bones were never submerged or placed under running
water. To prevent cracking while drying, the teeth and associated alveolar bone were cleaned
with a rubbing alcohol solution and cotton.

Skeletal Analysis
Skeletal analyses followed the guidelines established in Standards for Data Collection from
Human Skeletal Remains (Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994). Osteological observations included
inventory of skeletal elements, age estimation, skeletal metrics, skeletal nonmetrics, and
observations for pathological and anomalous conditions (Appendix B). Inventory was recorded
in numerical code according to the completeness of the bone or portion of the bone.
Both burials consisted of pre-adult individuals who had not attained complete skeletal maturity or
full dental development and eruption. Therefore, ages were derived from stages of dental
development and eruption (Anderson et al. 1976; Fanning and Brown 1971; Haavikko 1970;
Liversridge et al. 1993; Moorrees et al. 1963; Shour and Massler 1941; Ubelaker 1989) and
epiphyseal union (Bass 1995; Brothwell 1981). Both individuals were likely not skeletally
mature enough to have manifested any or all of the osteological features that help distinguish
males from females. Consequently, observations of the pelvic and cranial morphology (see
discussions in Angel 1969; Bass 1995; Houghton 1974, 1975; Krogman and Iscan 1986; Stewart
1979; Ubelaker 1989; and Ullrich 1975) were recorded, but no attempt was made to assign a sex
to each individual other than to note certain characteristics were more consistent for one sex or
the other.
Skeletal measurements were taken in accordance with guidelines established by Moore-Jansen
and Jantz (1989). Nonmetric skeletal observations and pathological observations were recorded
in numerical code. Pathological conditions were also described in narrative form and plotted on
28

skeletal diagrams, and anomalous conditions were noted in the “Comments” section of the
skeletal inventory forms. Ethnicity was assessed from morphological observations of the facial
bones (see Bass 1995; Brues 1990; Krogman and Iscan 1986; Rhine 1990; Stewart 1979;
Ubelaker 1989), dentition (Rhine 1990), and femora (Stewart 1979). The crania of both
individuals were fragmented and did not permit measurements that could be applied to
discriminant function equations to assess biological ancestry.
Dental data were also collected according to the guidelines of the Standards. Most data were
collected through gross observation, although a 10x hand lens was utilized when necessary.
Dental inventory, including antemortem and postmortem tooth loss; development/eruption;
location and degree of calculus deposits; presence and location of all observable caries and
abscesses; degree of attrition; and the presence of enamel hypoplasias were documented both
numerically and visually. Enamel hypoplasias were measured from the mid-point of the defect to
the cemento-enamel junction. Anomalous dental conditions were noted in the “Comments”
section of the dental inventory forms. Measurements for mesial-distal and buccal-lingual
diameters and crown heights were taken for each observable permanent tooth, and morphological
observations of the permanent dentition, following Turner et al. (1991), were recorded.
All pathological and anomalous dental and skeletal conditions were digitally photographed, as
were all skeletal features diagnostic of age. Occlusal and buccal/labial views of the dentition
were routinely photographed as well as diagnostic mortuary and personal artifacts. All images
were recorded digitally.

Analysis of Artifacts
After being processed in the GMI laboratory, the artifacts found in association with the remains
were examined and documented. The analysis included identifying and recording basic
information about each item (material; function; style/design; and, when possible, date of
manufacture or introduction to the marketplace) and photographic documentation.

CURATION OF MATERIALS
The remains will be reinterred in the Bates family lot in Oak Grove Cemetery in Denton County
in accordance with the wishes of a descendant. Associated artifacts will be reburied with the
remains. All field and laboratory records and maps will be prepared for curation, including the
placement of these items in archival quality containers. Field notes, burial forms, photographs,
and other data gathered during these investigations will be curated at TARL in Austin.

BURIAL DESCRIPTIONS AND DISCUSSION

Due to the size of the skeletal sample at the Bates Family Cemetery, most interpretation will
focus on the two excavated individuals with only limited comparison to other historic burial
samples. While more ambitious investigations have been undertaken by burial samples as small
as three individuals (e.g., Tiné and Boyd 2003), these samples were typically part of a much
larger burial population, and supplementary information, such as gravestone data from others
interred in the cemetery, provided additional insight into the larger population to which the
disinterred individuals belonged. Conversely, the Bates Family Cemetery only consisted of two
individuals, who may or may not have been representative of the local community. The
interments also predate other historic burials that have been excavated in Northcentral Texas by
several years.

BURIAL POSITION AND PLACEMENT
The headstone for Burial 1, the northern burial, identified the interred individual as James
Marshall Bates, who was born May 14, 1840, and died May 9, 1853—five days shy of his
thirteenth birthday. The southern headstone identifies the associated burial, Burial 2, as George
Wright Bates—born March 22, 1844, died January 23, 1858. As mentioned in Chapter 5, no
burial container was preserved; however, several nails (some with rust adhering to wood grain)
surround the remains in each burial and indicate that each had been interred in a wooden
receptacle. Also, the outlines of the burial fill mimicked the silhouette of a hexagonal coffin.
Burial 1 (Figure 16) was a single, primary interment. The skull was exposed at 126 cm below
datum (bd), approximately 2.5 m (8.25 ft) south of the northern fence (see Figure 3). The bottom
of the burial extended to 138 cm bd. The burial was oriented roughly east-to-west with the top of
the head pointed west and the face to the south. The skeleton was in a supine, extended position
with the hands folded over the pelvis. Although most of the skeleton was articulated, taphonomic
processes have displaced several elements. The lateral end of the right clavicle was in the
individual’s mouth. The lower three lumbar vertebrae (L3–5) and first sacral vertebra (S1), all
articulated, were on top of the right ilium and the caudal end of the sacral vertebra was oriented
toward the elbow of the right arm. The upper two lumbar vertebrae (L1–2) were medial to the
distal ⅓ of the left humeral diaphysis. The lower two thoracic vertebrae (T11–12) were on top of
31

the right 8th through 10th ribs. The hands were folded over the pelvis; however, the distal ends of
the radial diaphyses had migrated superiorly and were over the abdominal region. Hand elements
were scattered throughout the burial, including superior to the left shoulder. Both distal radial
epiphyses were on the lateral side of the distal right humeral diaphysis, as well. Along the lower
body, one patella was between the distal femora, while the other was on the medial side of the left
tibia at about midshaft. The cuboid of the right foot was lateral to the right femoral midshaft, and
the talus of the left foot was lateral to the distal ⅓ of the left tibia and fibula. Most of these
displaced elements are porous and/or lightweight. Their migration is probably the result of the
coffin filling with water after extensive rains and the bones floating. Because the L3–S1 and the
T11–12 were still articulated, some connective tissue remained on the bones during at least one of
these episodes.
Overall skeletal preservation of Burial 1 was good. Nearly all of the skeletal elements were
present and intact (see Appendix B for detailed skeletal inventory). The more delicate bones of
the face, ribs, and feet were heavily fragmented and incomplete. The cranial vault and mandible
32

were complete, although fragmented. Associated artifacts consist of nails, tacks, buttons, and the
shank of an iron screw. Also, a green stain appears on the top of the frontal bone of the skull
(Figure 17), near where it articulates with the parietals (bregma). The green discoloration
indicates that a copper-based object had been in contact with the skull. No such object was
recovered, however.

17.

Burial 2 (Figure 18) was approximately 1 m south of Burial 1 (see Figure 3). It was also a supine,
extended primary interment, oriented east-to-west. The top of the individual’s skull was oriented
to the west with the face to the east. The arms were folded over the abdominal region. Burial 2
did not exhibit the extensive taphonomic skeletal displacement that Burial 1 did. Aside from
some splaying of the proximal ends of the right radius and ulna and slight migration of elements
of the hands, feet, and sternum, the skeletal elements were in proper anatomical position.
Although still quite good, the skeleton was slightly less well preserved than Burial 1 (see
Appendix B for detailed skeletal inventory). The ribs and cranium were more fragmented, and
postmortem fractures were common along the postcranial skeleton, particularly the spongy ends
of the diaphyses of the leg bones. The elements of the feet, however, were better represented.
Similar to Burial 1, associated artifacts were limited to nails, tacks, and buttons. Several bones
exhibit rust stains from adjacent nails and tacks. The superior surface of a distal hallux (big toe)
phalanx also demonstrates green staining from a copper-based object (Figure 19), although no
item made of this material was recovered.

ARTIFACTS

Burial 1
Coffin hardware was relatively simple and consisted of the nails (n=20) used to construct the
coffin and several small iron tacks (n=24) that most likely held an interior lining in place (Figures
20 and 21). The shank of an iron screw was recovered from the area surrounding the skull
(Figure 22). The nails and tacks have square shanks that indicate cut nails. Though still presently
used in some industries, machine-cut nails were the predecessor to today’s rounded wire nails,
which generally replaced cut nails in the United States around the turn of the twentieth century
(Nelson 1968; Wells 1998). Personal artifacts consisted of bone buttons concentrated around the
pelvis and lower back. As mentioned above, a green stain on the skull indicates that it had been
in contact with a copper-based object although no such objects were recovered.

Whole buttons and button fragments indicate that at least eight buttons were present. Four styles
are represented. The most common type (n=4) consisted of a button 19–20 millimeters (mm) in
diameter. The back is flat, while a depression approximately 9 mm in diameter has been cut into
the center of the front, producing a rim around the outer periphery (Figure 23, a–d). Five holes
for attachment have been bored into the depression. Three of these buttons were recovered
slightly superior to or under the left ilium. The fourth was from the soil matrix surrounding three
displaced lumbar vertebrae. A fragment of another button of similar style was removed inferior
to the left pubis and ischium. The remaining three styles of button were slightly smaller than the
first type. One button, identified inferior to the ischio-pubic ramus, is similar to the first except
that the button itself (16.5 mm in diameter), holes, and center concavity (7.3 mm) are smaller (see
Figure 23e). The rim is slightly convex rather than flat like the first style, and the size of the rim
relative to the button is larger. Another button recovered from the same area also has five holes
inside a central concavity (10 mm in diameter). It measures 17.1 mm in diameter and has a ring
around the inner perimeter of the rim (see Figure 23f). A final style was recovered from the
matrix surrounding the lower three lumbar vertebrae. It measures 16.7 mm in diameter and has
five holes for attachment (see Figure 23g). Although the front of the button is slightly depressed,
it lacks a distinct rim along the outer periphery. Instead, a small rim surrounds the center hole.
Bone buttons were frequently utilitarian in function and were often used on trousers and
underwear (Luscomb 1992:25). The location of the recovered buttons around the pelvic region is
consistent for these uses. The larger buttons with the more commonly observed style are
probably from the same garment, likely a pair of pants. The smaller buttons might be from an
undergarment and/or attached suspenders to the pants. No evidence of suspenders (e.g., buckles,
rings) was identified, however. The variety among the smaller buttons probably reflects the use
of whatever was available to either make the garment or replace lost buttons.

Burial 2
Similar to Burial 1, coffin hardware was simple and limited to machine-cut iron nails (n=79) and
tacks (n=42). One tack head from Burial 2 adhered to rust-encrusted fabric and further supports
the suggestion that the burial containers had been lined with fabric. Buttons were the only
personal artifacts observed. Two bone buttons—one slightly superior to the iliac crest, the other
inferior to the left ischio-pubic ramus—were identical to the prevalent button type recovered from
Burial 1 and probably were associated with a pair of trousers (Figure 24 a–b). Four identical
porcelain buttons were recovered between the iliac crests and ribs (see Figure 24 c–f). Two
buttons were present on each side of the vertebral column. The buttons measure roughly 11 mm
in diameter. The front lacks a distinct rim but is rounded with a concavity in the center where
four holes are located. By the early 1840s, porcelain buttons were mass-produced in the United
States, which contributed to their popularity and affordability into the twentieth century (Owens
2000; Sprague 2002). The size and location of the porcelain buttons recovered from Burial 2
probably represent buttons for an undergarment. A green stain on one of the toe phalanges
suggests an additional burial inclusion. The stain is the result of contact with a copper-based
material. However, no objects composed of this material were recovered.

Discussion
Burial at the Bates Family Cemetery was simple. Both individuals were buried in wooden coffins
without metal ornamentation. Earlier field investigations indicated that the graves were originally
marked with fieldstones or crudely made headstones of locally available sandstone. It was not
38

until later that the manufactured marble gravestones were set. These findings are consistent for
the relatively early dates—1853 and 1858—for the burials. This period predates the florescence
of the mortuary industry in the later half of the nineteenth century when relatively inexpensive,
mass-produced burial containers and mortuary hardware became readily available. Also, during
the 1850s, Denton County, and the rest of Northcentral Texas, was still very much the frontier,
and communities were remote. Fort Worth and Dallas, which would have been a considerable
distance away, did not obtain, their first railroad lines until the 1870s (Enstam 1995; McDonald
1978; McElhaney 1995; Schmelzer 2007), and it was another decade before the first rail lines
were constructed in Denton (Hervey 2002). The nearest railroad in what later became the city of
Frisco, a few miles to the east, was not established until 1902 (Minor 2007). The first store in
Little Elm did not open until 1859 (Bates 1989[1918]; Hervey 2002), after both individuals had
died. Other, more distant, general stores were probably in operation at the time; however, it is not
certain whether such stores regularly carried mortuary furnishings at that time or if the journey
could be made before burial of the deceased was necessary.
Personal artifacts were limited to clothing buttons, and these buttons were all common,
inexpensive utilitarian types. Although geographic remoteness partially explains this observation,
these items are not at all uncommon in historic burials. Personal artifacts of later period burials in
Northcentral Texas often consisted only of buttons and other clothing fasteners, most of which
were common, utilitarian types. Fifteen turn-of-the-twentieth-century burials excavated from the
Odd Fellows section of Pioneer Cemetery in Dallas, Texas, indicated that members of the middle
and upper-middle classes were reluctant to bury valuable personal belongings. Recovered
personal artifacts tended to be mundane items such as plain metal and porcelain buttons
associated with the clothing of adults, and safety pins and porcelain buttons associated with
infants and young children (Cooper et al. 2000). A comparison of the Pioneer Cemetery burials
with 14 burials removed from a contemporary Dallas paupers’ cemetery revealed only subtle
differences in the personal artifact assemblages that might not be detected without prior
knowledge of the social classes of the two burial samples (Tiné et al. 2002).
Both skeletons indicated contact with a copper or copper-alloy object. Burial 1 has a green stain
at the top of the skull, and Burial 2 demonstrates a similar stain on the distal phalanx of a big toe.
No copper-based artifacts were recovered, however, and it is likely that the objects were either so
small that they were missed by the excavators or simply did not preserve. It is possible that the
stains were caused by pins used to secure a burial garment or wrap. Prior to the 1880s in the
United States, corpses were often clothed in a shroud or winding sheet (Farrell 1980). Though
the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, Iserson (1994) defines a shroud as a garment,
similar in appearance to a nightgown, in which the deceased is clothed. A winding sheet, on the
other hand, is a sheet wrapped around the corpse. The face was exposed for viewing prior to
burial, but later, the ends at the head and feet were sewn or tied shut to resemble a double-ended
sack. Winding sheets were used both to clothe the deceased in a coffin and, particularly for
earlier burials, as a coffin in its own right. Burials 1 and 2 both had burial containers. Both also
were wearing pants. The available descriptions of winding sheets imply that the corpse was
unclothed and that the sheet served to cover the body. However, some customs might have
included wrapping a clothed body, perhaps as an extra layer of protection from the burial
environment. A stain from a copper object at the head of one individual and the foot of another is
consistent with this practice in which pins secured the sheets at both ends.

39

Despite their overall similarity, the two burials differed slightly. The primary disparity is that
Burial 2 yielded more than twice as many nails and nearly twice as many tacks as Burial 1. Both
burials were excavated in identical manners; therefore, it is unlikely that any of these materials
were simply overlooked. Indeed, the excavators noticed the considerable number of nails in
Burial 2 compared to Burial 1. Although some were fragmented, the recovered nails and tacks
were typically intact and suggest that poor preservation was not a factor. The skeleton of Burial 2
measures about 150 cm (59 in) in length, whereas Burial 1 is smaller with a skeletal length of
approximately 129 cm (51 in). The individual in Burial 2 might have been buried in a larger
container that required more hardware for its construction. However, the small variation in the
size of the two individuals, alone, does not necessarily account for the significant difference in
the amount of nails and tacks in each grave. It is possible that the burial receptacle for Burial 2
was more complex in design or refined in construction and therefore required additional
hardware. If the placement of the marked gravestones is correct, Burial 2 was interred five years
after Burial 1. The temporal difference might indicate a difference in the availability in basic
items, such as nails and tacks, or in that of the coffin itself. Two different individuals might have
even constructed each of the coffins. The possibility that Burial 2 also had an additional box
outside the burial container is unlikely, however. First, though an additional receptacle would
require more nails, it would not explain why additional tacks were necessary for the inner box.
Furthermore, the outer box was frequently the box in which a coffin or casket was shipped.
When the isolated location of the Bates family home is considered, however, it would have been
more practical, and probably necessary, to use a locally constructed burial container that did not
require a shipping box.
The buttons recovered from each of the burials differ slightly in both style and material. Both
have identical bone buttons that, based on size and location, probably secured the fly and
waistband of a pair of trousers. Burial 2 also had four additional smaller porcelain buttons that
were uniform in appearance, while Burial 1 had four additional smaller buttons that were made of
bone, but of three different styles. It is not clear whether this represents a temporal difference in
the availability of certain commodities, such as buttons or undergarments, or if it is merely a
chance variation. Porcelain buttons had begun to be mass-produced in the decade preceding the
death of the earliest buried individual, but may not have been introduced or readily available to
the area until the later half of the 1850s when the other individual died.

SKELETAL REMAINS

Burial 1
As mentioned in a previous section, the skeleton was nearly complete and well preserved. As a
result, several observations are possible. In terms of demography, observable features for
assessment of ethnicity include the nasal and alveolar areas of the skull, the femora, and the
dentition. The nasal aperture is relatively narrow. The nasal spine is prominent and a nasal sill, a
thin line of bone at the base of the nasal opening, is present. These features are more common in
populations of European ancestry. The individual also lacks the alveolar prognathism commonly
seen among individuals of African descent (Bass 1995; Krogman and Işcan 1986; Stewart 1979;
Ubelaker 1989). In addition, the femoral shafts of Burial 1 demonstrate a slight anterior
curvature seen more frequently among non-African populations (Stewart 1979). The individual
demonstrates such a strong expression of Carabelli’s trait on the first maxillary molars that an
40

accessory cusp occurs on the bucco-lingual cusp. Carabelli’s trait is both more frequent and
prominent in expression among European populations (Hillson 1996:91; Scott 1980). The
maxillary incisors also lack the pronounced shoveling (vertical ridging on the mesial and distal
sides) of the lingual surfaces that is most common among Asian populations and least frequent
among Europeans (Carbonell 1963; Hillson 1996:88).
As mentioned in Chapter 5, sex assessment was hindered by the individual’s lack of skeletal
maturity. Therefore, although the pelvis is narrow like most males, the pelvic elements had not
completely united and grown to the final proportioning. Similarly, the cranial features were
generally gracile to neutral and would suggest an adult female. However, the individual probably
had not experienced the hormonal changes that would result in a more rugged, masculine
expression of these features. Both gravestones indicate males, and the pattern of associated
buttons is consistent for a pair of trousers. The skeletal evidence is, however, inconclusive due to
the individual’s young age.
Age was based on epiphyseal fusion and dental development and eruption. All long bone
epiphyses were open. The vertebral neural arches are fused to the bodies, and a few vertebrae
indicate traces of an epiphyseal ring. Elements of the pelvis have not united at the acetabulum,
and the epiphyses of the hand and foot elements have not fused. This stage of skeletal
development is consistent for an individual 10–15 years of age.
The permanent dentition is complete, although the second and third molars are unerupted, and the
third molars are still encapsulated in the tooth crypt. Although the premolars on the left side of
the mouth have erupted and are nearly in full occlusion, the right mandible has retained the
primary molars (Figure 25), and the premolars have not erupted. The right maxillary first
premolar has erupted, but the second premolar has not (Figure 26). Although the second primary
molar still covers this tooth, the roots indicate some degree of resorption. Several of the teeth
were loose in their sockets and could be removed and examined for stage of development of the
crowns and roots. An age range of 11 to 14 years was determined on the basis of dental
development, and the age of the individual has been refined to this range. This age range is
consistent with the ages derived from the birth and death dates on each stone, 12 and 13 years,
although the stone most likely associated with this individual is for the younger of the two.
No pathological conditions were observed on the skeleton, but one anomalous condition was
noted. The neural arch of the twelfth thoracic vertebra (T12) normally exhibits a transitional
morphology in which the superior articular facets are flat like other thoracic vertebrae, but the
inferior facets are angled like a lumbar vertebra. All vertebrae for Burial 1 were present, and the
neural arch of the T12 for this individual differed from the typical morphology. Instead of
straight, the right superior articular facet of the T12 of Burial 1 is angled like a lumbar vertebra.
The left side retains a typical thoracic morphology. Consequently, the articulating T11 above
T12 also demonstrates lumbarization of the right inferior articular facet. The condition is most
probably genetic in origin and had no negative effect on the individual.
Though not pathological, ridges on the radii and ulnae indicate frequent strenuous use of the arm
muscles such as for lifting, twisting, and pulling (Figure 27). Ridging is evident on the anterior
aspect of the proximal diaphysis of both ulnae at the insertion for the brachialis muscle, which
flexes the forearm. The left ulna demonstrates a U-shaped ridge with the open portion of the “U”
oriented medial-distally. No reactive bone is evident. Rather it has a rough texture common for
muscle attachment sites in the skeleton. The right ulna provides a milder expression. Instead of a
41

distinct U shape, a small, slightly curved ridge occurs. The posterior aspects of the middle ⅓ of
the diaphyses of both radii exhibit slightly rough-textured oval areas near the insertions for the
pronator teres muscles, which pronate (twist clockwise) and flex the forearms.
Pathological conditions observed on the dentition include a carious lesion on the mesial surface of
the right primary second molar, and enamel hypoplasias on the mandibular canines. Dental caries
is a process in which acid is produced by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates from the diet.
This acid destroys the hard tissues of the tooth and forms a cavity in the crown or root of the tooth
(Hillson 1996; Larsen et al. 1991). Enamel hypoplasias are areas (usually in the form of pits or
horizontal furrows) of reduced enamel thickness. Although sometimes of genetic origin or the
result of localized trauma, they are usually the consequence of the temporary redistribution of
available nutrients away from the growth process and toward the maintenance of more vital
biological functions during times of illness and/or insufficient nutrition (Goodman and Rose
1991). Location of each hypoplasia, based on measurement from the cemento-enamel junction
(CEJ) of the tooth to the center of the defect, was compared with a chart devised by Goodman et
al. (1980) for permanent dentition development to provide an estimate of when the defect was
42

formed. Each mandibular canine demonstrated two linear defects that are consistent for stress
episodes between 2 and 2.5 years of age and around 4 years of age. The earlier defect might
reflect weaning stress when a child transitions from breast milk, which is both more nutritious
and confers some maternal antibodies, to a less nutritionally adequate diet and reliance upon his
or her own developing immune system. The later hypoplasia might have been the result of
inadequate nutrition and/or illness. Although not directly causative, such stress episodes may
have compromised the individual’s biological resistance and left him vulnerable to the agent that
resulted in his early demise.
It is uncertain whether the unilateral delayed eruption of the right premolars is the result of a
localized disturbance, such as trauma, or a genetic anomaly. The enamel of the right first
maxillary molar and maxillary incisors demonstrates opaque patches indicative of interruption of
the tooth mineralization process. Their antimeres do not. Similarly, the crowns of the right
maxillary third molar and right maxillary first premolar demonstrate less calcification than their
left counterparts. This condition, however, is not visible on the mandibular dentition, although
the third molars and right premolars cannot be observed because they are still inside the tooth
crypt. A final unusual condition observed along the dentition of Burial 1 was that the right

maxillary dentition is crowded and the canine overlaps the lateral incisor and first premolar
(Figure 28). The canine is not completely developed and probably had not broken the gum line.
Though not in complete occlusion, the left maxillary canine demonstrates slightly more
development of the root.

Burial 2
The skeleton of Burial 2 is not as well preserved as Burial 1 in that the more delicate elements
were more frequently fragmented; however, overall skeletal preservation is good, and the
skeleton is nearly complete. Like Burial 1, Burial 2 demonstrates skeletal and dental
characteristics consistent with an individual of European ancestry. The nasal aperture is narrow
with a sharp nasal spine and prominent nasal sill, the alveolar region is not prognathic, the
femoral shafts are curved anteriorly, the incisors are flat rather than shoveled, and the first
maxillary molars demonstrate a pronounced expression of Carabelli’s trait. Burial 2 also appears
to lack the skeletal maturity to adequately ascertain sex. The pelvis is narrow; however, the
pelvic elements have not yet fused at the acetabulum and, therefore, have not yet completed
growth. Cranial morphology is generally sex-neutral, although it demonstrates lack of
development of the nuchal crest or the brow ridges. These traits are common among females and
early/pre-adolescent males. The mandible, however, indicates some squaring and development of
the mental eminence, which is more common among males (Bass 1995; Krogman and Işcan
1986; Stewart 1979; Ubelaker 1989). In terms of skeletal age, epiphyseal closure is about the
44

Figure

same as that observed in Burial 1. Burial 2 appears slightly more advanced in that more vertebral
centra indicate traces of epiphyseal ring development, and fewer show scars of recent union of the
neural arches with the centra. Nevertheless, skeletal age falls within 10 to 15 years—the same
range as Burial 1. The permanent dentition is complete and slightly more developed than Burial
1. None of the primary dentition remains, and all teeth except the third molars have erupted. The
right maxillary canine would have barely broken the gum line. An age range of 11–15 years was
derived for this individual based on dental development and eruption.
No dental caries were observed, although the maxillary canines, maxillary first premolars,
mandibular premolars, and mandibular canines exhibit a hypoplastic line on each tooth. The
locations of the defects on the tooth crowns indicate that a significant stress episode occurred
around age 5. Poor nutrition and/or illness are possible reasons for the formation of the
hypoplasias. Though not pathological, Burial 2 shares the same dental anomaly as Burial 1 in
that the right maxillary dentition is crowded and the canine overlaps the buccal surface of the first
premolar and the labial surface of the second incisor (Figure 29).
Burial 2 also demonstrates a skeletal anomaly similar to that seen in the lower thoracic vertebrae
of Burial 1. In the instance of Burial 2, however, the neural arch of T12 is fully lumbarized and
T11 demonstrates a morphology characteristic of T12. In addition, the individual exhibits similar
ridging along the insertions for the brachialis and pronator teres muscles observed on the arm
bones of Burial 1 (Figure 30). The proximal left ulnar diaphysis exhibits a pronounced U-shaped
ridge on the anterior aspect at the insertion for the brachialis muscle oriented the same as with
Burial 1; however, no ridging appears on the right ulna. The posterior aspects of the middle ⅓ of
the diaphyses of both radii exhibit rough-textured oval indentations near the insertions for the
pronator teres muscles.

Several pathological lesions were observed on the skeleton of Burial 2. The right tibia
demonstrated unhealed striations along the entire medial aspect of the proximal ½ of the
diaphysis, and patches of active periostitis in the form of woven bone occur on approximately ⅓
of the medial aspect of the distal ½ of the diaphysis (Figure 31). Striations with indication of
sclerosis (healing) are visible along roughly ⅔ of the lateral aspect of the proximal ½ of the
diaphysis. The right fibula exhibits small, diffuse patches of sclerotic periosteal plaque along
approximately ⅓ of the proximal ⅔ of the diaphysis. Most of the sclerotic bone is concentrated in
the proximal ⅓ along the medial and anterior surfaces, although a small amount (< ⅓ of the
surface) extends along the posterior surface of the middle ⅓ of the diaphysis. The left tibial
diaphysis is not as severely affected at the right; however, it demonstrates active striations and
fiberbone lesions along approximately ⅔ of the medial aspect of the distal ⅓ and diffuse
sclerosing striations and active fiberbone on approximately ⅓ of the posterior aspect of the distal
⅓. The adjacent left fibula displays healing striations along roughly ⅔ of the posterior surface of
the proximal ⅓ of the diaphysis.
The bilateral expression of these lesions suggests a systemic infection, and the combination of
active and healing lesions implies a chronic condition. In addition to the periostitis on the lower
leg bones, a series of periosteal lesions occurs along the pleural (interior) surfaces of several ribs
(Figures 32 and 33). Although the ribs are fragmented and somewhat incomplete, several could
be cross-mended. At least four left ribs in the middle to lower region exhibit periosteal striations
on this surface. While one rib exhibits patches involving less than ⅓ of the visible surface, the
other three indicate involvement of ⅓–⅔ of the visible surface. Some sclerosis is evident. At
least six right ribs demonstrate similar striations on the pleural surfaces with involvement of ⅓–⅔

of the visible surface. The heads of two right ribs and necks of two right ribs exhibit active,
fiberbone periosteal patches on ⅓–⅔ of the visible pleural surface. A sclerosing periosteal plaque
is visible on the pleural surfaces of the necks of two right ribs and one unsided neck fragment.
Less than ⅓ of the visible surface is affected. An oval-shaped lytic lesion also occurs on the
inferior surface of the medial right clavicle directly lateral to the medial metaphysis (Figure 34).
The lesion measures 8.4 mm medial-laterally by 6.3 mm anterior-posteriorly, and the boundary is
well defined. The lesion penetrates into the trabecular bone. The circumference of the defect and
edges of the trabeculae are smooth but do not indicate new bone formation. The medial end of
the left clavicle did not preserve well and could not be observed for a similar lesion. In addition,
two segments of the sternal body subtly indicate new bone formation on the dorsal surfaces. The
new bone appears to be partially integrated into the cortex and may possibly indicate normal bone
turnover. However, considering the pathological involvement of the nearby ribs and right
clavicle, an infectious origin is more likely.

The periosteal reaction on the interior surfaces of the ribs indicates a chronic infection of the
pulmonary region. Tuberculosis is a possible diagnosis. In humans, the disease typically results
from infection by the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is usually spread through the
inhalation of contaminated water droplets coughed into the air by an infected individual.
Depending on the virulence of the pathogen, the amount inhaled, and host resistance, the disease
can be acute or chronic. The latter condition is characterized by disappearance of symptoms as
the pathogen becomes encapsulated in calcified scar tissue, usually in the lungs and hilar lymph
nodes, and later reactivation of the dormant pathogen by release from the primary lesion if the
individual is under biological stress. The pattern of remission and relapse can repeat itself several
times (Aufderheide and Rodríguez-Martín 1998:118–120). Production of large quantities of
granulomatous scar tissue from overstimulation of the immune response inhibits normal
respiration and is usually the eventual cause of death (Powell 1991).
The lesions observed on the ribs of Burial 2 are similar to those described by Kelley and Micozzi
(1984) who examined over 400 skeletons of individuals of known cause of death. The majority
of individuals who demonstrated periostitis on the pleural aspect of the ribs died of pulmonary
tuberculosis. These lesions are attributed to direct infection of the ribs from lesions on the lungs.
Indeed, the periostitis on the ribs and sternal body of Burial 2 is likely from infection of a
pathogen in the pleural cavity. The destructive lesion on the inferior surface of the medial
clavicle is also consistent with tuberculosis and may have formed as the result of either pressure
from an abscess on the superior aspect of the right lung or an abscess resulting from depositing
the pathogen in the trabecular bone of the clavicle. The tuberculosis bacilli thrive under high

oxygen tension and, when disseminated into the blood stream, will tend to concentrate in areas of
highly vascularized trabecular bone, and involvement of the long bone shafts without affecting
the joints is rare (Aufderheide and Rodríguez-Martín 1998). The lesions on the tibial and fibular
diaphyses, therefore, are somewhat inconsistent with tuberculosis. However, they possess more
trabecular bone than adult bones and may have been affected through this avenue. It is also
possible that the pathological expression in the lower leg bones is the result of a secondary or
opportunistic infection by another pathogen because the immune system had been weakened.
When ribs are impacted by pulmonary tuberculosis, other locations in the skeleton are typically
not affected (Kelley and Micozzi 1984). The pattern of rib involvement differs from the typical
pattern observed by Kelley and Micozzi (1984). They noted that the left side is about twice as
likely as the right to be affected, and that ribs 4–8 are most commonly involved (Kelley and
Micozzi 1984:382). The right ribs of Burial 2 appear to be more frequently and more severely
affected, and the middle to lower ribs most commonly expressed lesions. This is not to say,
however, that just because the observed pattern does not perfectly match the typical model,
tuberculosis was not the cause. Pneumonia is an unlikely culprit because the disease is typically
acute and, without antibiotics or spontaneous recovery, the individual would probably not survive
long enough for the skeleton to be impacted.

Actinomycosis, a chronic disease caused by the bacterium Actinomyces israelii is another
possible diagnosis. The disorder may be systemic or localized and is facilitated by lesions in the
mouth that provide an anaerobic environment for the bacteria, which are endogenous to the oral
cavity, to reproduce. The bacteria may then spread to adjacent tissues and become aspirated into
the lungs where lesions form. Although rare, the pathogen can be spread to other parts of the
body through the bloodstream. Skeletal involvement is not common and is usually the result of
direct contact with an abscess. Nearly any bone can be affected; however, in the pulmonary form
of actinomycosis, the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae are most commonly affected, as well as the
ribs, cervical vertebrae, and sacrum. Pulmonary lesions can spread to the adjacent rib surfaces,
most often on the right side. Initial rib response is a diffuse, hypervascular, periosteal reaction
identifiable on dry bones by an increased number and size of the vascular channels and foramina.
More advanced expression involves reactive ossifying periostitis and foci of bone loss
(Aufderheide and Rodríguez-Martín 1998:193–194). The lesions observed on the ribs of Burial 2
are similar to the milder, more immediate skeletal expression. Both halves of the rib cage are
affected, but the right side appears to demonstrate a greater degree of skeletal involvement. As
with tuberculosis, the periosteal lesions on the lower legs do not conform to the patterning of this
specific disease and might indicate a different etiology for the infection of those particular
elements, or an altogether different disorder in which all of the osseous lesions share a common
origin. Indeed, other nonspecific, systemic disorders are possible diagnoses.
Discussion
Burial Identity and Genetic Relationship
The two associated gravestones indicate that the interred individuals were brothers. Indeed, both
individuals share features considered to be under genetic control that are not common in larger
populations. Both demonstrate the same crowding of the right maxillary dentition that resulted in
the overlapping canine and its delayed eruption. Also, both individuals exhibit at least partial
lumbarization of the superior articular facets of the T12 and subsequent variation in the
morphology of the T11 neural arch. The sharing of these atypical biological features strongly
suggests that the two individuals are genetically related, as the headstones indicate.
Chapter 4 indicated that the marble gravestones were not the original grave markers, rather they
replaced earlier fieldstones or homemade tombstones several years later. The location of the
inscribed marble markers in relation to the actual burials, though close, is inexact and indicates
that the specific location of the burials had become obscured. An in situ marble footstone base
aligned with the northern marble marker base argues against the headstones having been moved
at a later time. If the gravestone placement is correct, the northern burial, Burial 1, is for James
Bates, who died at age 12. George Bates, who died at age 13, would have occupied the southern
burial (Burial 2). The age ranges for the two skeletons are nearly identical, although Burial 2
indicates slightly more advanced dental and skeletal development. Most of the muscle
attachments on Burial 2 are more pronounced and the bones of the skeleton are somewhat larger.
The length of the skeleton in Burial 1 is 129 cm (51 in) and would indicate of living stature of
about 4 feet, 3 inches plus another inch or two to account for soft tissue. Burial 2 had a skeletal
length of about 150 cm (59 in or 4 ft, 11 in), which would translate to a living stature of 5 ft or
more. Therefore, a substantial difference in size existed. It could be argued that Burial 1
indicated more episodes of childhood stress that may have affected his growth and development,
but the general pattern indicates that Burial 2 was probably slightly older at death than Burial 1,
and that the gravestones identify the correct individuals.
51

Biological Synthesis
The two individuals interred in the small family graveyard are similar to many other children of
their time in that they died before reaching adulthood. Burial 2 is a little less common in that he
suffered a chronic illness over a long enough period that it impacted his skeleton. More than
likely the condition resulted in his death. The skeleton of Burial 1, on the other hand, left no
clues as to what may have caused his death. Prior to the advent of antibiotics, death was a
frequent consequence of illness, and many infectious conditions were of an acute nature in which
the individual did not survive long enough for any evidence of the disease to manifest itself on
the skeleton. Illness, however, was not the only possible cause of death. In an era when children
were much less protected from their physical environment, and life was typically more hazardous,
fatal accidents were not uncommon. The well-preserved skeleton of Burial 1 did not indicate any
potentially fatal trauma, although a previous traumatic event is one possible explanation for the
delayed eruption of right premolars and hypocalcifications on several teeth on the right side of the
mouth. Not all traumas or their complications impact the skeleton (e.g., drowning), however. On
the other hand, W. P. Bates, an older brother, recalled that there was a great deal of illness in the
area the first two years the family lived in Denton County to the extent that the region was widely
regarded as “sickly” (Bates 1989[1918]:296). He also mentions losing one brother the second
year the family was in the area, and is probably referring to James, who was most likely interred
in Burial 1. Both the state of medical knowledge at the time and availability of medical care in
rural areas contributed to mortality. W. P. Bates noted that Dr. Henry Dye of Plano was the
family physician (Bates 1989[1918]). Not only was he geographically distant (approximately 25
miles from the Bates home), he covered a 30-square mile area and could be difficult to locate at a
given time.
Both disinterred individuals experienced at least one episode of significant metabolic stress, as
indicated by enamel hypoplasias, and the impact may have left them less resistant to any
condition that may have resulted in their deaths. Although direct comparisons are not possible
based on differences in sample size, geographic region, time period, and social and economic
status, at least 15 percent of observable dentitions from most burial samples that predate 1920 for
which such data are available exhibit enamel hypoplasias (see Tiné 2000:484, and Tiné and Boyd
2003:46, for summary data). It should be noted that the ages of these boys when they
experienced these episodes indicates that they were still living in Kentucky at the time, and no
descriptions of the family’s life there is available.
Though disease was at times a major threat, nutrition was apparently not a problem for the family
in Denton County. One of the older brothers recalls that food was plentiful and enumerates a
wide variety of game, dairy products, fish, wild fruit, and nuts that were readily available (Bates
1989[1918]). The absence of osteological disorders related to dietary deficiencies on the
skeletons of the two boys is consistent with this recollection. The reported abundance of wild
food sources may also partially explain the low frequencies of dental caries for the two
individuals. Although cariogenic foods such as flour apparently were consumed, trips to the mill
were long and required several days to complete (Bates 1989[1918]). Therefore, processed
carbohydrates were probably not a common or plentiful component of the regular diet. Of
course, the young age of the individuals is another explanation for the low occurrence of dental
caries. The only carious lesion observed was on a primary tooth of Burial 1 that had been part of
the erupted dentition for probably over 10 years.

52

The ages at death (12 and 13 years) of the two skeletons are somewhat less common, even for
pre-antibiotic populations. Although many people died in their pre- and early teens, individuals
of this age group are proportionately less frequently represented in skeletal and historic
gravestone samples. This is typically a period when the individual has developed his or her
immune system and has an awareness of physical danger and how best to avoid it, but has not yet
had to assume the full duties and of adulthood and their consequent risks. Nonetheless, out of
necessity, all but perhaps the youngest family members were probably required to contribute to
the maintenance of the household, and some of these activities could be arduous or hazardous.
Development of muscle attachment sites on the forearm bones of both individuals indicates that
although still not adults, they were responsible for strenuous tasks.

53

CHAPTER 7
SUMMARY

Bioracheological analysis of the remains and artifacts recovered from the Bates Family Cemetery
(41DN549) is largely consistent with the information provided on the two headstones. Skeletal
and dental development indicates that both individuals died between the ages of 11 and 14 years.
Ages at death inferred from the birth and death dates on the headstones are 12 and 13 years of
age. One individual is slightly more developmentally advanced. The gravestone nearest this
burial was for the older child, and suggests that the placement of the headstones (which replaced
earlier fieldstones or homemade markers) is correct. The skeletons were not mature enough to
accurately assess sex, but the arrangement of clothing buttons relative to the skeletons indicates
that both were clothed in trousers. Given the time period, such dress would be more indicative of
males, which the headstones also indicate. Both individuals shared similar anomalous conditions
on the skeleton and dentition, and suggest that they were genetically related. The headstones
indicate that they were brothers.
The two burials are indicative of the lifeways and hardships faced by many pioneer families.
Development of muscle attachment sites on the bones suggests that the individuals were
performing strenuous tasks as children, most likely to contribute to the welfare of the family.
Enamel hypoplasias on the dentition demonstrate that both survived earlier episodes of significant
biological stress. However, their resilience had its limitations, and neither individual survived to
full adulthood. The loss of children in the nineteenth century was an all too common occurrence.
One individual left no indication of cause of death, although acute illness is a probable culprit.
The other exhibited skeletal lesions consistent for a chronic pulmonary infection that most likely
was the ultimate cause of death. It is uncertain whether irregularities of the teeth of one
individual that are limited to one side of the dentition represent an episode of localized trauma, or
if they are related to a genetic anomaly also observed in the right dentition.
Associated artifacts indicate simple, practical burials that probably represent a combination of
custom and necessity. Both were in coffins and possibly were wrapped in winding sheets, which
was not uncommon in the mid-1800s. Tacks suggest that the interiors of the coffins were lined
with fabric, although no ornamental hardware was present. Personal artifacts consisted of
common, utilitarian buttons associated with male clothing. The professionally manufactured
marble gravestones that were visible on the ground surface were placed in the location of the
graves several years after the two boys had been buried. Fieldstones or homemade grave
55

markers, at least one etched with a cross, originally marked the location of the burials and
probably were not replaced until the area became less remote and commodities were more
accessible.
All of the gravestones have been moved and are presently stored at Oak Grove Cemetery in
Denton County where the parents and other relatives of the two disinterred boys are buried. The
remains of the two individuals and recovered artifacts will be re-interred adjacent to their family
members in this cemetery. Photographs, field notes, analysis forms, and all other documentation
of the burials will be curated at TARL in Austin.
