ABSTRACT
On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA conducted cultural resources monitoring of overhead electric,
underground electric, and gas utility projects in support of the VIA Westside Multimodal Transit Center.
The work involved the installation of overhead electric and underground electric and gas utilities to
accommodate the new facility. The excavations for the overhead and underground electric utilities
investigations were conducted within the existing right-of-way (ROW) of North Medina Street from just
south of West Commerce Street to just north of West Travis Street, within the ROW of the western portion
of West Travis Street, and within the parking lot north of the former International and Great Northern
Railroad (I&GNRR) Passenger Station. Also, a small portion of underground electric work was done in the
ROW at the western edge of West Houston Street. Excavations for the underground gas utility replacements
were conducted within the ROWs of West Travis and West Houston streets. Most of the excavations were
primarily in the same location as the underground electric portion of the project. Thus the Area of Potential
Effects (APE) totals 1.2 acres of existing, city-owned street ROW located in downtown San Antonio, Bexar
County, Texas, with vertical disturbance ranging from 5–12 feet deep.
The archival review found that the project area is consistently depicted in historic maps with a segment of
the Alazan Acequia traversing it from northwest to southeast. In addition, a portion of electric underground
work is adjacent to the former I&GNRR station, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places,
and is considered one of the most significant buildings within the City of San Antonio’s Cattleman Square
Historic District. Monitoring investigations were therefore proposed at four locations, specifically: along
North Medina Street about halfway between West Salinas and West Travis streets; along West Travis
Street, about halfway between North Medina and North Frio streets; along West Houston Street near the
intersection of North Frio and West Houston streets; and the parking lot of the I&GNRR station.
SWCA’s intensive archaeological monitoring was performed during construction activities that occurred
during various site visits between October 7–24, 2013, and March 12–27, 2014. The monitoring activities
were conducted in order to identify and record any existing cultural resources within the project area. The
efforts identified historic and modern cultural debris dating to the twentieth century within the project area.
Two brick and mortar pipeline caps were encountered within North Medina Street at a depth of 1–3 feet
below the surface. As they are related to historic utilities construction, which is ubiquitous in the urban
setting and has very limited potential to contribute valuable information to the historic or archaeological
record, the pipeline caps are not considered significant. No evidence of the Alazan Acequia was
encountered within any of the excavations within the project area. In addition, no significant cultural
materials or artifacts associated with the former I&GNRR station or the Cattleman Square Historic District
were encountered. Two iron railroad spikes and two brick clusters were observed within the I&GNRR
station trench, but they were not associated with any significant cultural features or deposits. Overall, no
definitive evidence suggested by artifacts or features was observed in the project area that could be
associated with the Spanish Colonial or Republic of Texas eras. All work within the CPS Energy project
area was conducted within extensively disturbed deposits predominately dating to the twentieth century.
SWCA made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the project area. Based
on the results of the monitoring efforts, the excavation within the VIA Westside Multimodal Transit Center
had no effect on significant cultural properties.

the parking lot of the former I&GNRR station.
While excavations along the length of North
Medina Street are depicted in Figure 2, the scope of
the Antiquities Permit only included the monitoring
of excavations along North Medina Street between
West Houston and West Travis Streets, and in the
parking lot of the former rail station. All work was
done in accordance with the standards and
guidelines of the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) and the Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6645.
The monitoring occurred during various site visits
between October 7–24, 2013, and March 12–27,
2014.

INTRODUCTION
On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted cultural resources
monitoring of overhead electric, underground
electric, and gas utility projects in support of the
VIA Westside Multimodal Transit Center (Figure
1). The work involved the installation of overhead
electric and underground electric and gas utilities to
accommodate the new facility, and was entirely
contained within the existing rights-of-way (ROW)
of North Medina, West Travis, and West Houston
streets. In addition, a portion of the underground
work was conducted within the parking lot of the
former International and Great Northern Railroad
(I&GNRR) Passenger Station.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The investigations began with a review of historical
and archival records followed by close
archaeological construction monitoring in an effort
to identify, record, and characterize any extant
historic resources or deposits within the project
area. The background review determined that the
project area is consistently depicted in historic
maps with a segment of the Alazan Acequia,
constructed in 1874 (Figure 2). This historic canal
is believed to be between 6 inches and 24 inches
below the modern ground surface (Dippel and
Victor 2012). In addition, a portion of the project
area is adjacent to the I&GNRR station, which is
listed on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP), and is considered one of the most
significant buildings within the City of San
Antonio’s Cattleman Square Historic District.

Located in San Antonio, Texas, the project area is
in a highly developed urban setting on a level
landform between San Pedro and Alazan Creeks.
The project is about 1 mile west of the Alamo and
0.35 mile southwest of the Interstate (IH) 35 and IH
10 intersection in Bexar County, Texas. This
location is in an industrial and commercial area
with large warehouses and building complexes just
west of the heart of downtown San Antonio and
within an area of continuous occupation since the
city’s historic beginnings. The Union Pacific
Railroad track, formerly I&GNRR, is west of the
overall project area and adjacent to the former
I&GNRR station.
The underground gas and electrical lines were
collocated along the eastern portion of North
Medina Street and arched from the north to south
sides of West Travis Street. Utility pole
construction was limited to the east edge of the
North Medina Street ROW north of Travis Street;
and to the western edge of the North Medina Street
ROW, south of Commerce Street (although SWCA
was not involved with the latter portion).
Excavations for the underground gas utility
replacements were conducted within the ROWs of
West Travis and West Houston streets.

As depicted, this feature traverses the area from
northwest to southeast, potentially intersecting the
project in three places: along North Medina Street
about halfway between West Salinas and West
Travis streets; along West Travis Street, about
halfway between North Medina and North Frio
streets; and along West Houston Street near the
intersection of North Frio and West Houston
streets. The focus of the study, therefore, was in
these areas as well as construction activities within

moderately sloping uplands (NRCS 2013; Taylor et
al. 1991:21).

The main trench along North Medina Street
extended for a total distance of approximately 780
feet in length with a 100-foot long lateral along
West Travis Street. Five additional laterals, each 39
feet in length and extending west from the main
trench perpendicular to North Medina Street ROW,
were excavated. A 39-foot-long trench was
excavated perpendicular to the West Travis Street
ROW and was adjacent to the lateral along West
Travis. An 18-foot-long trench was excavated
within the southern ROW of West Houston Street
and adjacent to the sidewalk. Finally, a 180-foot
trench was excavated within the parking lot of the
I&GNRR station from an existing transformer and
extended east toward North Medina. The trenches
were approximately 2 to 3 feet wide and were
excavated down between 5 and 6 feet deep. The
excavation blocks around the manhole block
(MHB) were slightly wider and deeper, up to 5 feet
wide and 12 feet deep, respectively. All the work
was conducted with a 30-foot-wide construction
easement within the existing street ROWs. Thus the
Area of Potential Effects (APE) totals 1.2 acres of
existing, city-owned street ROW located in
downtown San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas, with
vertical disturbances ranging from 5 to 12 feet deep.

CULTURAL SETTING AND ARCHIVAL
REVIEW
The background review determined that the project
area has not been previously surveyed and that one
previously recorded archaeological site, 41BX620
the Alazan Acequia, is within or adjacent to the
project area (San Antonio Office of Historic
Preservation [SA-OHP] Acequia Map Sheets 15-57
and 15-58). Within a 1-kilometer radius of the
project area are 28 other previously recorded sites,
13 archaeological investigations, 9 properties that
are listed on the NRHP, the Main and Military
Plazas NRHP Historic District, 7 Official Texas
Historical Markers, and hundreds of local
neighborhood surveys (Atlas 2013). Additionally,
the APE is located within the City of San Antonio’s
locally designated Cattleman Square Historic
District.
Previously conducted investigations in the vicinity
of the APE include an early 1980s City of San
Antonio’s Vista Verde redevelopment project
(Labadie 1987), which documented many of the
sites within a 1-kilometer radius of the project area,
as well as the recent investigations for the West
Side Multi-Modal Transit Center Phases I and II
project conducted by Raba-Kistner (Held 2010;
Dippel and Victor 2012).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
GEOLOGY
The underlying geology of the project area is 100
percent Quaternary-age Fluviatile terrace deposits
adjacent to the San Pedro Creek (Barnes 1983).
These terrace deposits consist of predominately
gravel, limestone, dolomite, and chert, with sand,
silt, and clay. Most low terrace deposits along
entrenched waterways like San Pedro Creek are
above flood level (Barnes 1983).

ALAZAN ACEQUIA
Site 41BX620, the Alazan Acequia, is an extension
of the Upper Labor Acequia and has been
previously identified as potentially eligible for
listing on the NRHP (Dippel and Victor 2012). San
Antonio’s acequia system represents the first
municipal water system in what would later become
the United States. The acequia system continued to
supply water until the early 1900s, and is a
contributing element of the San Antonio Missions
National Historic Park (NRHP No. 78003147).

SOILS
The project area soils are mapped as 100 percent
Houston Black clay terrace deposits with 1 to 3
percent slopes (Taylor et al. 1991:Map Sheet 53).
The Houston series consists of clayey soils that are
very deep, moderately well-drained, and very
slowly permeable. These soils formed from weakly
consolidated calcareous clays and marls of
Cretaceous Age, and are found on nearly level to

As the Spanish established missions in Bexar
County, they also devised an irrigation and water
supply system using spring water. Friars supervised
the labor of Indians, settlers, and soldiers to

4

construct diversion dams and acequias (Cox 2005).
The system distributed water for agriculture,
personal consumption, and other household uses
(Porter 2009:48). Acequias are simple, soil-lined,
gravity-flow canals whose depressions can still be
seen today in certain areas of Brackenridge Park
(Cox et al. 1999).

MAIN AND MILITARY PLAZAS NRHP
HISTORIC DISTRICT
The Main and Military Plaza Historic District is an
area in downtown San Antonio comprised of
thirteen whole blocks, the two plazas, and portions
of two additional blocks. The district includes 36
contributing structures, 24 compatible structures,
and an open green space (Main Plaza). Contributing
structures include the primarily nineteenth- and
early twentieth-century two- and three-story
masonry structures, the eighteenth-century Spanish
Governor's Palace, nineteenth-century City Hall,
Bexar County Courthouse, and San Fernando
Cathedral (National Register Nomination Form No.
79002914).

The Upper Labor Acequia was one of two major
canals that were excavated to bring water to early
settlements between the San Antonio River and San
Pedro Creek (Cox et al. 1999). The Acequia Madre
(also known as Alamo Madre and Alamo Ditch)
was the first canal dug at the San Antonio Springs
from 1718 to 1744. It diverted water from the east
side of the headwaters of the San Antonio River,
just below San Antonio Springs, in present-day
Brackenridge Park.

CATTLEMAN SQUARE LOCAL HISTORIC
DISTRICT

Around 1776 a dam was built to divert spring water
into a second canal, the Upper Labor Acequia,
which was associated with the San Pedro Springs.
This dam was relocated during an archaeological
excavation near Hildebrand Avenue in 1996 (Cox
et al. 1999). The undressed, colonial-era limestone
dam had been expanded or repaired in the
nineteenth century by German masons who used
ashlar-dressed stones (Cox et al. 1999). The Upper
Labor Acequia was filled around 1893, although
traces of its limestone walls can still be found in the
backyards of some residential areas (Cox 2005).

The Cattleman Square Historic District is a small
collection of streets on the west side of Interstate
Highway 35 (IH-35) that was designated a local
historic district in 1985 (SA-HPO website). The
buildings within the district include a variety of
late-nineteenthand
early-twentieth-century
commercial and industrial structures. The
Cattleman Square Historic District is roughly
bounded by Travis and Martin streets to the north,
Buena Vista and Commerce streets to the south, IH35 to the east, and the railroad tracks to the west. In
1881, four years after the first rail line was extended
to San Antonio, the I&GNRR opened its line from
St. Louis to San Antonio. The first I&GNRR depot
was constructed shortly thereafter at West Houston
Street in what is today within the historic district
boundary. The expansion of the railroad to this
community led to a flurry of real estate activity in
the area, including a mix of new residential,
industrial, and commercial buildings.

The Alazan Acequia was built in 1874, extending
from the Upper Labor Acequia near its beginning at
San Pedro Springs and then heading north and west
before turning south (Cox 2005:56–57). The
Alazan Acequia is believed to be between 6 inches
and 24 inches below the modern ground surface
(Dippel and Victor 2012).
As the population of San Antonio grew during the
nineteenth century, the acequias could not meet the
demand and eventually became a source of disease
as people increasingly used them to dispose of
waste (Porter 2009:96). The canals also required
constant maintenance to keep them functioning
properly. The Espada Acequia is the only one that
still flows today.

One of the most significant buildings within the
district is the former I&GNRR Passenger Station at
123 N. Medina. The I&GNRR Passenger Station,
later known as the Missouri Pacific Station, was
designed in 1907 by architect Harvey L. Page. The
majestic building is of steel frame construction in
the plan of a Greek cross, with tan brick cladding, a
central dome, bell towers, mission-style parapets,
stained glass windows, and barrel vaults on the

identified as “I&GT N.R.R. Freight W. Ho.” By
1896, the entire project area is depicted, including
north of West Houston Street, where seven houses
front North Medina Street, and three face North
Frio Street. Development along Commerce Street
continues to intensify and the number of residential
structures also increases (1896 Sanborn Fire
Insurance Map Sheets 3 and 5). The 1904 and 1911
Sanborn maps revealed much of the same
information, with more commercial and residential
development throughout (1904 Sanborn Fire
Insurance Map Sheets 39, 47, and 48; 1911 Sanborn
Fire Insurance Map Sheets 15 and 16). The station
is depicted as a rectangular structure, labeled
“I.&G.N.R.R. Pass. Station,” in the 1896 and 1904
maps. By 1911, the I&GNRR station is expanded
and constructed into the domed structure present
today.

interior. The lantern over the dome features a
bronze Indian figure. It is one of two remaining
railroad stations in San Antonio, along with the
Southern Pacific Depot or Sunset Station on the
city’s east side. The station was built to replace the
earlier wood-frame I&GNRR depot constructed in
the late nineteenth century on West Houston Street.
The railroad eventually linked Austin to Laredo,
providing a route into Mexico. The depot closed in
1979 but has since been restored, was a banking
facility for decades, and is currently owned by VIA.

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
A review of 15 TxDOT historic overlay maps from
1835 to 1953 determined that no historic-age
resources are within the project area (Foster et al.
2006); however, the Alazan Acequia is depicted
apparently intersecting the project area in two
places on maps from 1883 and 1889. While the
1883 map of San Antonio by C.P. Smith illustrate
the Alazan Acequia as slightly south of its location
on the modern Acequia maps on file with the SAHPO, the 1889 map by J.J. Olsen matches the
modern depiction. An 1887 map of Bexar County
by J.D. Rullmann includes the railroad depot, but
does not show anything between it and San Pedro
Creek. The 1953 Army Map Service topographic
quadrangle of West San Antonio also depicts the
railroad depot, but contains no details of the project
area. Likewise, the other 11 maps did not contribute
any information.

CONSTRUCTION MONITORING
SWCA conducted archaeological monitoring of
construction activity associated with the VIA
Westside Multimodal Transit Center APE during
various site visits between October 7–24, 2013, and
March 12–27, 2014 (Figure 3). Construction
occurred on a total of 14 days within this period,
contingent upon weather and the CPS construction
schedule. Overall, the area was found to be heavily
disturbed by previous construction activity. As the
project area is located in a heavily developed urban
setting, historic utilities are a ubiquitous feature
type with little to no potential to contribute
significant information to the archaeological
record. As such, debris related to utilities
construction is considered modern disturbance. The
exception to this is the historic acequia system in
San Antonio. No evidence of the Alazan Acequia,
mapped as intersecting the project area in three
locations, was encountered. Artifacts were
photographed and assessed in the field; however, no
significant historic features, temporally diagnostic
artifacts, or significant items were encountered. As
such, construction activity was not halted.

Sanborn Fire Insurance maps from 1892, 1896, and
1904 that depict the project area were consulted
(Appendix A). The earliest map includes North
Medina Street, but only between West Houston and
Buena Vista streets. Most of the structures in this
map front Commerce Street, and include
residences, saloons, restaurants, a laundry, a
bakery, and a large lumber yard (1892 Sanborn Fire
Insurance Map Sheet 2). The location of the
I&GNRR station is depicted as a rectangular
shaped structure running north to south and

TEST PITS AND POST HOLES
On October 7 and 8, 2013, monitoring began near
the intersection of North Medina Street and West
Travis Street. Initial excavation consisted of six test
pits and five post holes. Test pits were excavated to
locate existing pipelines within the proposed
subsurface gas and electric line corridor
(collocated). A jackhammer was used to break
through the asphalt, followed by backhoe and
shovel excavation of the underlying soil until the
known utility was encountered. A probing rod was
used to verify the utility depth prior to careful soil
removal. Test pits measured roughly 3 feet wide by
4 to 9 feet long (Figure 4). Existing pipelines were
encountered at depths ranging from 3 feet 2 inches
below the surface to 5 feet 3 inches below the
surface and the maximum test pit depth was
approximately 9 feet (no utilities were located in
Test Pit 6). Historic cultural material encountered
within the test pits includes ceramic pipe fragments
and brick fragments. No indication of domestic
material (e.g., nails, glass, ceramics, etc.) was
present. Prevalent, modern debris encountered
includes plastic fragments, one “Bud Light” beer
can, asphalt, and concrete fragments.

Figure 4. Test Pit 2 excavation within North
Medina Street, facing west.

Concurrent with test pit excavation, a total of five
post holes were excavated between the curb and the
sidewalk along the east side of North Medina
Street. Post holes were hand excavated and
measured 20 inches wide by 8 feet deep (Figure 5).
As the post holes required the removal of much less
sediment than the test pits, fewer artifacts were
noted. The most common artifact encountered
within the post holes were fragments of ceramic
pipe (Figure 6).

east side of North Medina Street and north of West
Travis Street, facing north.

Soils varied within each pit/hole due to extensive
disturbance. In general, however, the upper 12
inches of the test pits consisted of asphalt and
gravel. Underlying soils consisted of gray to black
clay over yellowish clay that transitioned to wet,
gravelly clay in the deeper excavations. Water was
typically encountered at a depth of 4 to 5 feet below
the surface. All cultural material was encountered
in a heavily disturbed, secondary context, and no
intact features or diagnostic materials were
observed during the excavations.

CONSTRUCTION TRENCHES

Figure 7. Construction Trench within West Travis
Street, facing northwest.

Monitoring of the collocated pipeline and electric
line construction trenches excavation began on
October 11, 2013, within West Travis Street, and
east of North Medina Street. Monitoring of the gas
line construction trenches began on March 12,
2014, within the I&GNRR station parking lot (see
Figure 3). As with the test pits excavated within the
paved roadways, the asphalt was fragmented with a
jackhammer prior to careful backhoe excavation of
the underlying soil.
ELECTRIC LINE CONSTRUCTION TRENCHES
The construction trench along West Travis Street
measured approximately 3 feet wide by
approximately 100 feet long, where it terminated on
the south side of the roadway (Figure 7). The
western terminus of this trench segment ties into a
man hole block (MHB) located at the intersection
of West Travis and North Medina Streets. From this
intersection, a perpendicular construction trench
extended approximately 230 feet to the south and
50 feet to the north within the eastern portion of the
North Medina Street roadway. Short spurs to the
east connected the main construction trench to the
utility pole locations at the edge of the roadway and
north of West Travis Street (Figure 8). All trenches
were excavated to depths ranging between 5 and 7
feet below the ground surface. The excavations that
continued south of the North Medina and West
Travis Street intersections were not monitored.

Street and short spur to utility pole locations, facing

Figure 9. Brick and gas pipeline debris encountered
during excavations.

Figure 10. Red brick and mortar pipeline cap
scraped in the west wall of the construction trench.

Artifacts noted within the construction trenches
were consistent with those previously noted in the
test pits and post holes, consisting of brick
fragments and ceramic pipe fragments mixed with
modern debris (Figure 9). A concentration of red
brick and mortar was scraped in the west wall of the
construction trench at a depth of 1 to 2 feet below
the surface, south of West Travis Street (Figure 10).
This concentration was similar to a pipeline cap that
was more thoroughly observable extending into a
MHB and will be discussed in detail below. The
upper 6 to 12 inches of the construction trench was
comprised of asphalt and gravel. Soils were similar
to those previously noted in the test pits and post
holes, consisting of gray to black clay over
yellowish clay. All cultural material was
encountered in a heavily disturbed, secondary
context, and no significant historic features or
diagnostic materials were observed during the
excavations.

UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC AND GAS LINE
TRENCHES
An underground electric trench was excavated
within the I&GNRR station parking lot (Figure 11).
The trench measured 3 feet wide, 180 feet long, and
4 feet deep. Several existing utility lines were
observed within it. The trench was initially
excavated as two test pits at the western and eastern
ends to determine the location of existing buried
utilities. The trench extended east from an existing
transformer box at the western terminus (Figure
12), across the southern end of the parking lot and
sidewalk, then shifted northwest towards the
western ROW and sidewalk of North Medina Street
(Figure 13).
Existing utility lines observed during construction
included 8 polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes, a cast
iron pipe, and a cable line. One of the existing lines
paralleled the northern profile of the trench (Figure
14). On average, the upper 4 to 6 inches of the
I&GNRR trench consisted of asphalt and concrete
followed by 8 to 10 inches of yellow, gravel
construction fill. The remaining 40 to 50 inches of
trench were composed of dark grey clay.
Construction sand fill was also observed around the
existing utilities at various depths ranging from 2 to
4 in depth.

Three concrete slabs were encountered during
construction excavations of the I&GNRR trench.
The first concrete slab was located approximately
25 feet from the eastern end of the trench at
approximately 1.5 feet below ground surface
(Figure 15). The slab measured 1.5 feet long, 6.7
inches thick, and spanned the entire width of the
trench. This slab was left in place during
construction activities. The second concrete slab
encountered during construction excavations was
located approximately 65 feet from the western end
of the excavated trench at a depth of 2.8 feet below
ground surface (Figure 16). The block measured
approximately 3 feet tall by 3 feet long and
protruded approximately 1.25 feet into the
excavated trench from the southern profile wall.
The portion of the concrete mass that projected into
the trench was removed by jackhammering. One
iron railroad spike (Figure 17) was found in
association with this concrete slab. The last
concrete slab encountered during construction
activities was located at the western most end of the
I&GNRR trench. This concrete slab was a part of
the foundation and concrete casing associated with
the existing electrical box (Figure 18). The concrete
casing was located approximately 3 feet below the
ground surface and spanned approximately 2 feet
across the northern profile wall.

Two concentrations of brick were also identified
within the profile walls of the I&GNRR trench. The
first was located within the southern profile wall
approximately 98 feet from the eastern end of the
excavated trench (Figure 19). The deposit was
located approximately 1.3 feet below ground
surface and measured 2 feet thick by 6 feet long.
The bricks were composed of a yellow clay material
with some fragments of a gray mortar still attached.
There was no distinct shape or pattern to this brick
concentration. No other cultural material was found
in association with this brick concentration. The
second brick concentration was located in the
northern profile wall approximately 65 feet from
the western end of the I&GNRR trench. This
concentration was composed of red clay brick
fragments mixed with compact, black clay soil
matrix and limestone gravels (Figure 20).

A metal pipe intersected the trench 2 feet north of
the PVC pipes at approximately 2.5 feet in depth
(Figure 24). Approximately 20 feet north of the
southern end of the trench, a layer of gravel fill
spanning 3 feet of the trench was observed
indicating a possible ditch for a deeper buried utility
(Figure 25). Three additional metal pipes
intersected the trench near the northern end. The
trench was widened to 4 feet at the northern
terminus to replace one of the metal pipes and tiein the new pipe (Figure 26). No cultural materials
were encountered during the excavations.

Figure 21. Iron railroad spike found in association
with red brick fragment concentration within the
northern profile wall of the I&GNNR trench.

The West Houston Street trench was 2 feet wide
and 17 feet long. The trench was excavated within
the sidewalk and southern ROW of West Houston
Street down to 3 feet deep (Figure 27). The upper
layer consisted of 10 inches of asphalt underlain by
red sand and gravel, followed by dark gray clay
with gravel and iron manganese inclusions (Figure
28). The excavations were completed once an
existing gas line located at 4 feet was replaced.
Late-twentieth-century debris consisting of
aluminum cans and glass bottles were observed in
the backfill and trench during excavations;
however, no significant cultural features or
materials were encountered.

The concentration measured approximately 3 feet
thick by 3 feet long, and was located approximately
2.3 below ground surface. No defined shape or
pattern was identified within this brick
concentration. One iron railroad spike was
encountered in association with it (Figure 21).
In addition to the I&GNRR station trench, two
additional trenches were excavated within West
Travis and West Houston streets for the gas line
installations (Figure 22). The West Travis Street
trench was approximately 2 feet wide and 39 feet
long. Entirely within the ROW of West Travis
Street, the trench was perpendicular to the road,
terminating at the sidewalks along the northern and
southern ROW of the street.

MANHOLE BLOCKS (MHBS)
Within the monitored portion of the electric line
construction trenches, two MHBs were excavated;
one at the intersection of North Medina and West
Travis Streets (MHB1) and a second near the
northern project terminus (MHB2) (see Figure 3).
These blocks consisted of cubical areas that were
excavated with a backhoe and shored with concrete
trench boxes prior to the installation of the
manholes and subsequent backfilling (Figures 29
and 30).

The West Travis Street trench was excavated to 4
feet in depth and the profile was similar to the
previous trenches. The upper layer consisted of 10
inches of asphalt and gravel, followed by clay with
iron magnesium inclusions (Figure 23). During the
excavations, existing utility lines were encountered,
including two PVC pipes and four metal pipes. The
PVC pipes were located within the southern end of
the trench approximately 2 feet north of the
sidewalk and were 2 feet in depth.

Excavation of MHB1 began on October 7 and 8,
2013, and was completed on October 15 and 17,
2013. This block measured 768 cubic feet, situated
within the northeastern portion of the North Medina
and West Travis Street intersection (Figure 31).
Within the southwestern corner of MHB1, a red
brick and mortar cap was encountered at roughly 1
foot below the surface, continuing to a depth of
approximately 3 feet (Figure 32).
This mass of brick and mortar served to seal out-ofuse water and sewer lines that were cut in this
location, extending only to the southwest into the
trench wall. The bricks were primarily unmarked,
heavy, and measured 4 by 8 inches. A few of the
bricks were stamped with a “SECO” maker’s mark
(Figure 33).

Street trench, facing west.

MHB2, located near the northern project area
terminus within North Medina Street, was
excavated on October 14, 2013. This block
measured 768 cubic feet (Figure 34). Cultural
material observed within MHB2 consisted of 2 to 3
bricks encountered at 2 to 4.5 feet below the
surface. As the MHBs were excavated in-line with
the construction trench, the soils were consistent
with the clays previously noted beneath
approximately one foot of asphalt and gravel. All
cultural material was encountered in a heavily
disturbed, secondary context, and no intact features
or diagnostic materials were observed during the
excavation of MHB2.

MONITORING SUMMARY
Archaeological monitoring was conducted during
all excavation activity within the mapped location
of the Alazan Acequia; however, the channel was
not encountered. All cultural material observed
within the excavations dates to the twentieth
century, primarily related to previous construction
activity and utilities, and was mixed with a small
amount of miscellaneous modern debris (e.g.,
plastic, beer can, etc.). Artifacts encountered
include ceramic pipeline fragments and red bricks.
Two brick and mortar pipeline caps were
encountered within and to the south of the North
Medina and West Travis Street intersection. These
are related to previous water and sewage pipelines
and are not considered significant historic features,
rather, a contributing element of the heavy
disturbance noted throughout the construction
monitoring area. Trenching activities within the
I&GNRR parking lot recovered two iron railroad
spikes and two brick clusters, but they were not
associated with any significant cultural deposits.
Soil in the project area generally consisted of gray
to black clay over yellowish clay that transitioned
to wet, gravelly clay in the deeper excavations.
Overall, the excavations revealed very disturbed
contexts dating from the early-twentieth century
through the present.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA conducted
archival research and cultural resources monitoring
of overhead electric, underground electric, and gas
utility projects in support of the VIA Westside
Multimodal Transit Center. The work involved the
installation of overhead electric and underground
electric and gas utilities to accommodate the new
facility, and was entirely contained within the
existing ROW of North Medina, West Travis, and
West Houston Streets. In addition, excavations
were conducted within the parking lot of the former
I&GNRR station. The APE totaled approximately
1.2 acres of existing, city-owned street ROW
located in downtown San Antonio, Bexar County,
Texas, with vertical impacts ranging from 5 to 12
feet below the surface.

century. SWCA made a reasonable and good faith
effort to identify historic properties within the
project area. Based on the results of the monitoring
efforts, the excavation within the monitored portion
of the VIA Westside Multimodal Transit Center
had no effect on significant cultural properties.

The work performed by SWCA included an indepth historical and archival records review
followed
by
archaeological
construction
monitoring in an effort to identify, record, and
characterize any extant historic resources or
deposits within the project area. The focus of the
study was the mapped location of the Alazan
Acequia, constructed in 1874. This historic canal is
believed to be between 6 inches and 24 inches
below the modern ground surface (Dippel and
Victor 2012).
SWCA’s intensive archaeological monitoring was
performed during construction activities that
occurred in October 2013 and March 2014. The
goal of the work was to examine and assess any
cultural deposits revealed in the construction,
adequately document the cultural resources, and
provide sufficient information to make
determinations on age and significance. All work
was done in accordance with the standards and
guidelines of the THC and the CTA.
The construction monitoring identified cultural
debris dating to the twentieth century within the test
pits, post holes, construction trenches, and MHBs
excavated during the project. Artifacts encountered
include ceramic pipeline fragments, bricks, iron
railroad spikes, and gas pipeline debris, which were
found in disturbed soil along with modern debris.
Two concentrations of red brick and mortar
encountered between 1 to 3 feet below the surface
within North Medina Street serve to cap defunct
water and sewer pipelines. These are not considered
historically significant as they represent historic
utilities construction and maintenance activity that
is ubiquitous in urban settings and has a very
limited potential to contribute valuable information
to the archaeological record. Additionally, one red
brick fragment concentration, one yellow brick
concentration, and three concrete slabs were
observed within the I&GNRR parking lot trench,
but these too were found to have no historical
significance as a consequence of their disturbed
context. No evidence of the Alazan Acequia was
encountered in any of the excavations associated
with the project.
All work within the construction monitoring area
was conducted within extensively disturbed
deposits predominantly dating to the twentieth
