MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 15 January 2015, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the City of Round Rock’s Frontier Park Improvement Project
in Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas (Project Area). The Project Area is located
approximately 150.0 feet (ft) (45.8 meters [m]) south of the intersection of Chisholm Valley Drive
and Frontier Trail in Round Rock, Texas. The proposed project entails conducting general
improvements within the existing Frontier Park location, including minor modifications to the
existing Frontier Park trail right-of-way (ROW) within the Project Area. The Area of Potential
Effect (APE) for the Project Area totals 7.0 acres.
The proposed undertaking is currently owned and operated by the City of Round Rock, a
political subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Additionally, proposed improvements to the Project Area are
being funded by Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds provided by the U.S
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). As such, the proposed undertaking also
falls under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), as
amended. As the proposed project is a publicly sponsored undertaking, the City of Round Rock
is required to provide for a cultural resources inventory of the Project Area to assess the project’s
possible impacts on any cultural resources in the Project Area. At the request of the City of Round
Rock, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the
ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if the
development of the Project Area would have the potential to adversely affect any significant
cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL) or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The
cultural resources survey was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7144.
The cultural resources survey resulted in the reassessment of 1 previously recorded site,
41WM442. Site 41WM442 was originally documented as a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter
near the central portion of the Project Area. However, only a single chert flake was observed
during the site reassessment, and the flake was restricted to surface contexts on the site. Six
shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of the originally documented site centroid for site
41WM442, all of which produced negative results. The originally delineated site boundaries could
not be reevaluated based upon the paucity of cultural materials along the modern ground surface
and within shovel tests. Given the low density of cultural materials, and the lack of temporally

diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, preserved floral/faunal remains, or intact archeological
deposits on the site, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41WM442 is ineligible for formal designation
as an SAL or inclusion on the NRHP. As such, no additional investigations are recommended for
site 41WM442 in connection with the currently proposed undertaking.
Based on the survey-level results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed improvements
to the City of Round Rock’s Frontier Park Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for formal designation as SALs or eligible for listing
on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that the City of Round Rock be allowed to proceed
with the proposed improvements to Frontier Park relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT and Section
106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human
remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or
ongoing maintenance of the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was contracted by the City of Round Rock
to conduct an intensive cultural resources survey for the Frontier Park Improvement Project in
Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas (Project Area; Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The Project Area is
located approximately 150.0 feet (ft) (45.8 meters [m]) south of the intersection of Chisholm Valley
Drive and Frontier Trail in Round Rock, Texas. The proposed project entails conducting general
improvements within the existing Frontier Park location, including minor modifications to the
existing Frontier Park trail right-of-way (ROW) within the Project Area. The Area of Potential
Effect (APE) for the Project Area totals 7.0 acres.
The proposed undertaking is currently owned and operated by the City of Round Rock, a
political subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project falls under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). Additionally, proposed improvements to the Project Area are
being funded by Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds provided by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). As such, the proposed undertaking also
falls under the jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), as
amended. As the proposed project is a publicly sponsored undertaking, the City of Round Rock
is required to provide for a cultural resources inventory of the Project Area to assess the project’s
possible impacts on any cultural resources in the Project Area. At the request of the City of Round
Rock, Horizon conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the
ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if the
development of the Project Area would have the potential to adversely affect any significant
cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for formal designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL) or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The
cultural resources survey was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7144.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive cultural
resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s
(THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Jennifer L.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

Cochran served as the Principal Investigator for the project and conducted the field investigations
with the assistance of Jared Wiersema (Horizon staff archeologist).
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 15 January 2015. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts. The Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre on
projects between 11.0 to 100.0 acres in size. As such, a total of 14 shovel tests were necessary
on the 7.0-acre Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
minimum survey standards by excavating 19 shovel tests within the boundaries of the Project
Area.
The cultural resources survey resulted in the reassessment of 1 previously recorded site,
41WM442. Site 41WM442 was originally documented as a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter
near the central portion of the Project Area. However, only a single chert flake was observed
during the site reassessment, and the flake was restricted to surface contexts on the site. Six
shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of the originally documented site centroid for site
41WM442, all of which produced negative results. The originally delineated site boundaries could
not be reevaluated based upon the paucity of cultural materials along the modern ground surface
and within shovel tests. Given the low density of cultural materials and the lack of temporally
diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, preserved floral/faunal remains, or intact archeological
deposits on the site, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41WM442 is ineligible for formal designation
as an SAL or inclusion on the NRHP. As such, no additional investigations are recommended for
site 41WM442 in connection with the currently proposed undertaking.
Based on the survey-level results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed improvements
to the City of Round Rock’s Frontier Park Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for formal designation as SALs or eligible for listing
on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that the City of Round Rock be allowed to proceed
with the proposed improvements to Frontier Park relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT and Section
106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human
remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or
ongoing maintenance of the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The cultural resources survey reported herein assessed approximately 7.0 acres within
an existing public park in southern Williamson County, Texas. The Project Area is located
approximately 150.0 ft (45.8 m) south of the intersection of Chisholm Valley Drive and Frontier
Trail in Round Rock, Texas and can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute
Pflugerville West, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1-1). The proposed project entails
conducting general improvements within an existing public park, including minor modifications to
the existing Frontier Park trail ROW within the Project Area. The vegetation within the Project
Area consists of short-to-medium grasses and oak trees. Photographs of the Project Area are
provided in Figures 2-1 to 2-4.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in southern Williamson County, Texas. Williamson County is
situated near the southern end of the Lampasas Cut Plain (Hill 1901; Hill and Vaughn 1900;
Johnson 1931:125) in Central Texas and close to the common junction of 3 significant
physiographic provinces—the Lampasas Cut Plain, the Edwards Plateau, and the Blackland
Prairie. The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards
Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a
narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones Fault Zone from the Red River Valley in
northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low
topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms, and streams
flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated
with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands
composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In
places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by
a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms
of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is a roughly triangular area of rolling hill country in central and
north-central Texas situated between the Brazos and Colorado rivers, ranging in elevation from

754.0 to 1312.0 ft (230.0 to 400.0 m) above mean sea level (amsl). The Lampasas Cut Plain
forms a limestone upland that has been dissected by the Brazos River and its tributaries,
resulting in landforms characterized by generally rounded uplands cut by moderately broad,
shallow valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and supports a mixed savanna flora,
whereas soil is moderately deep in valley floors, where it supports mixed riparian woodlands and
forests. Karst features include sinks, caves, and rockshelters, but such are neither common nor
extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant, but not widespread across the Lampasas Cut Plain,
and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Brazos River Basin. A tributary to
Lake Creek bisects the Project Area from east to west. This tributary feeder flows northeast and
joins the main branch of Lake Creek approximately 1.2 miles (mi) (1.9 kilometers [km]) northeast
of the Project Area. Lake Creek flows northeast and converges with Brushy Creek approximately
2.6 mi (4.2 km) northeast of the Project Area. Brushy Creek flows generally northeastward to its
confluence with the Little River in Milam County, which in turn flows a short distance eastward
and empties into the Brazos River. The Brazos River flows southeastward across the Blackland
Prairie and Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance
northeast of East Matagorda Bay.

2.3

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the Project Area overlies Del Rio Clay and the Georgetown Formation
(Barnes 1974). Del Rio Clay consists of calcareous and gypsiferous sediments and ranges in
thickness from 40.0 to 70.0 ft (12.2 to 21.3 m), while the Georgetown Formation consists of mostly
limestone sediments with some marl and ranges in thickness from 30.0 to 80.0 ft (9.1 to 24.4 m).
Geomorphologically, the Project Area is situated on the Denton-Eckrant-Doss
Association, which consists of moderately deep to very shallow, calcareous, clayey, stony, and
cobbly soils found in upland settings that formed in indurated fractured limestone and limy earths
(Werchan and Coker 1983). The soils of this association are deep, clayey sediments that usually
have minimal potential to contain intact, subsurface archeological resources at any substantial
depth. Two defined soil types are mapped within the boundaries of the Project Area. These soil
types are described in Table 2-1 (NRCS 2015), and their distribution is mapped in Figure 2-5.
While aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in deep alluvial sediments
adjacent to major streams in Central Texas, the relative antiquity of the pre-Holocene-age uplands
in the Project Area suggests that any cultural resources would be constrained to the modern
ground surface, rather than in buried contexts, in erosional settings lacking integrity. Intact, buried
archeological deposits may occur within alluvial sediments near major streams, though no
Holocene-age alluvial sediments are mapped within the current Project Area. Other things being
equal, any cultural resources associated with the soils mapped in the Project Area would be
expected to occur on the modern ground surface in deflated, eroded contexts that would lack
stratigraphic integrity. Historic-era resources may be found in virtually any physiographic
environment.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from
the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period
(14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the
Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was considerably
cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was more heavily
forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The Late
Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying
trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by
grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During the Post-Glacial period,
the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable. The deciduous forests
had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming
trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there
appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to
5000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental
conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by 1500 years ago.
Williamson County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in western
Williamson County. Average annual precipitation totals 32.0 inches (in) (81.0 centimeters [cm])
and temperature averages 19.0 degrees Celsius (°C) (67.0 degrees Fahrenheit [°F]) annually,
ranging from 36.0°C (96.0°F) in August (the warmest month) to 15.0°C (59.0°F) in January (the
coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total

Rock, Williamson County, Texas

annual rainfall ranged from 12.0 to 25.0 in (30.0 to 64.0 cm) were followed by abnormally wet
years with 45.0 to 50.0 in (114.0 to 127.0 cm) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm
trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall (Baker
1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91.0 cm (36.0 in) of rain that fell within an 18hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56.0-cm (22.0-in) deluge
that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker 1975). Lower rainfall
amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently
that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east
often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from
the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the
region and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.5

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits
of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as
“approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through western
Williamson County in the vicinity of the Project Area.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird. Reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat snake, eastern
hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake, copperhead, western
diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog, diamondback water snake,
Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and antelope were common during
the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are no longer native to this region
(Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within the Central Texas archeological region. The indigenous
human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle
throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North America, mobility and
settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (9200 TO 6000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now confidently be extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (9200 to 6000 B.C.) (Black 1989). This stage coincided with ameliorating
climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the extinction of
herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods within this
stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate projectile
points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and bone
foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central Texas are
known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of
plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is little
evidence in this region of the hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere
in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced
throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2
periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These include the Early
PaleoIndian Period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points (i.e., Clovis,
Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which is
characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6000 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic stage
(6000 B.C. to A.D. 800). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation of
lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less pronounced in Central
Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the big game
populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base composed of
smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this hunting and gathering pattern is
characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the
development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of
projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows greater diversity
during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. In
Central Texas, the Early Archaic subperiod extends from 6000 to 3000 B.C., the Middle Archaic
subperiod extends from 3000 to 1000 B.C., and the Late Archaic subperiod covers the 1000 B.C.
to A.D. 800 timeframe. Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers
differentiating these 3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well.
Perhaps most markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod,
continuing into the Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic
subperiod. In addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered
to constitute evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least
partially accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 800 TO 1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 to 1600) (Black 1989) is defined by the
appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin phase
sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to suggest
that the Austin phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north who lacked the
ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1600 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Álvarez
de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed
South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay. However,
European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The first half of
the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as the first
effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social systems.

Rock, Williamson County, Texas

This process is clearly discernible at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data suggest population
declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased participation on the part of the
Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement of Texas began in
the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished.
The earliest known historical occupants of Williamson County were the Tonkawa Indians.1
The Tonkawa traditionally followed buffalo herds on foot and periodically set fire to the prairie to
aid them in their hunts. During the 18th century, however, they made the transition to a horsebased culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Decimated by European diseases and by
warfare with the Cherokee and Comanche, the Tonkawa were generally friendly toward the early
settlers of Williamson County, but were nevertheless removed from Central Texas by the 1850s.
Lipan Apaches and Comanches were also associated with the area that would become
Williamson County. Before the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Lipan Apaches ranged
through the western part of present-day Williamson County, and, after Spanish missions were
established on the San Gabriel River in the 18th century, the Indians frequently raided the
missions for horses. Their enemies, the Comanches, arrived in the area in the 18th century and
lived in parts of the territory of Williamson County until as late as 1838. After they were crowded
out by Anglo settlers, the Comanches continued to raid settlements in the county until the 1860s.
There also appear to have been small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and Mayeye
Indians living in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements.
While Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca may have traveled through the area in the 16th
century, it was probably first explored by Europeans in the late 17th century, when Capt. Alonso
De León sought a route between San Antonio and the Spanish missions in East Texas that would
serve as a drier alternative to the more southerly Camino Real. The new route passed through
the area of Williamson County along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River and was called
Camino de Arriba. In 1716, 2 explorers in the Spanish service, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis and
Domingo Ramón, led an expedition that passed through the area and camped on Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel River, naming them respectively Arroyo de las Bendítas Ánimas and Rio de
San Xavier. The San Xavier missions, which were founded in the mid-18th century and occupied
a series of sites along the San Gabriel River, were just across the eastern border of Williamson
County in present-day Milam County, and the area was extensively explored by the Spanish.
During the Mexican period, parts of the county were awarded as land grants, first to several
Mexican families, then as part of Robertson’s colony, but no settlement resulted from these
grants.
Anglo settlement began during the Texas Revolution and the early days of the Republic
of Texas, when the area was part of Milam County. In 1835, in an attempt to strengthen the
frontier against Indian attack, a military post was built near the headwaters of Brushy Creek in
what would become southwestern Williamson County and was named for Capt. John J.
Tumlinson, Jr., the commander of the company of Texas Rangers who garrisoned the post. The

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

post was abandoned in February of 1836, when its garrison was withdrawn to deal with the
Mexican invasion. In 1838, the first civilian settlement was established by Dr. Thomas Kenney
and a party of settlers who built a fort, named Kenney’s Fort, on Brushy Creek near the site of the
present-day crossing of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. Several other sites on Brushy
Creek were settled soon after, but Indian raids kept Anglo settlement in check, and a number of
the early pioneers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians over the next few years.
In 1842, many of the early farms were abandoned when Governor Sam Houston advised
settlers to pull back from the frontier. The Indian threat eased after 1846, and part of the influx of
settlers who came to Texas after its annexation traveled to the frontier along Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. By 1848, there were at least 250 settlers in what was then western Milam
County, and in the early months of that year, 107 of them signed a petition to organize a new
county. Recognizing that the petitioners needed a seat of local government that was considerably
closer to them than Milam County, the Texas legislature established Williamson County on 13
March 1848, naming it for prominent judge and soldier Robert M. Williamson. Georgetown, the
county seat, was laid out during the summer of that year, and the district court was in session by
October. According to the census of 1850, Williamson County had a population of 1379 Anglos
and 155 slaves living in agricultural communities on Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel. As was
common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage was used to grow corn. Three
families owned 15 or more slaves in 1850, but family farms and subsistence agriculture remained
the norm prior to the Civil War. While most of the settlers had moved to Texas from other southern
states, particularly Tennessee, a substantial contingent came from Vermilion County, Illinois; and
this latter group remained pro-Union and Republican in its political orientation during the
secession crisis.
On the eve of the Civil War, Williamson County had moved beyond the frontier stage and
was a populous, agriculturally diverse county. The Anglo population tripled between 1850 and
1860 to 3638, while the slave population grew even more dramatically to 891, six times the
number of slaves in 1850. Agricultural pursuits were quite varied and reflected the county’s
geographical diversity. Farmers used the rich blackland soils in the eastern half of the county to
grow wheat and corn. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but only 271 bales were grown in
1860, and it was not an important cash crop for most farmers. The early settlers had found large
herds of wild cattle in the 1840s, and cattle ranching for both home consumption and the market
was widespread throughout the county by 1860. The number of cattle on county ranches had
more than tripled from 11,973 head in 1850 to 38,114 head in 1860. Similarly, the number of
sheep grew from 2937 producing 3499 pounds of wool in 1850 to 16,952 sheep and
32,994 pounds of wool in 1860.
Williamson County was marked by political divisions during the secession crisis, divisions
that were carried over into the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unionist sentiment was strong in
the county, and a resolution denouncing secession was adopted by a Texas Constitutional Union
party meeting in Round Rock in 1860. One of the county’s delegates to the secession convention,
Thomas Proctor Hughes, was among the 8 who voted against the ordinance of secession. When
the ordinance was referred to a statewide election, Williamson County was one of 19 counties to
oppose it, rejecting secession by 480 to 349 votes. When the war came, most of the citizens of

16

Rock, Williamson County, Texas

Williamson County supported the Confederate cause, and at least 5 companies were raised in
the county: an independent “spy” company under James O. Rice, a company of Texas Rangers
for border defense under William C. Dalrymple, and companies in the Fourth, Seventh, and
Sixteenth Texas Cavalry regiments. While some of those who had opposed secession became
active Confederate supporters, others remained loyal to the Union and fled to Mexico or the North,
and a number enlisted in the Union army. In July 1863, 8 Williamson County men were caught
by Confederate troops while traveling to Mexico and were hanged near Bandera, Texas, and
other Unionists were persecuted during the war. The pattern of violence within the community
continued into the summer following the end of the war, when several men were arrested for
“flagrant crimes” and “illegal persecution of Union men.” In September 1865, a mass meeting of
the citizens of Williamson County was held on the San Gabriel River near Georgetown, and the
gathering set a general tone of reconciliation, which seems to have characterized the
Reconstruction period in Williamson County, a period that ended with the return of county
government to conservative Democratic control in 1869. Freed slaves formed several new
communities, and the county seems to have been free of much of the political and racial strife
that occurred in other Texas counties during Reconstruction. On the other hand, there was a
great deal of crime, much of it violent, in the latter 19th century. Horse and cattle thieves and
some of the more famous outlaws of the day, such as Sam Bass and John Wesley Hardin, preyed
on the property of citizens, and long-term family feuds and drunken brawls at the various saloons
in the towns added to the toll of homicides.
Though the Civil War had caused little material damage in the area, the county was a
much poorer place in 1870 than it had been in 1860. The total value of farms had fallen from
$833,418 to $389,239 and the value of livestock from $823,653 to $341,794. The economic
recovery in the 1870s was aided by the growth of the cattle and sheep industries and a dramatic
expansion of cotton farming. Various feeder routes to the Chisholm Trail passed through
Williamson County, and many cattle drives passed through or originated in the county from the
1860s through the early 1880s. With the coming of the railroads to the county in the 1870s,
Taylor, in the eastern part of the county, became an important rail center for the cattle trade.
Cattle-raising, after declining somewhat in importance in the early 20th century, was again a major
part of the agricultural economy by 1950, and in 1969 ranchers owned a record 65,093 cattle.
Sheep- and goat-raising followed a similar pattern. Sheep ranching recovered its pre-war level
by 1880 and peaked at 39,961 sheep and 171,752 pounds of wool in 1890, then declined in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries to 13,397 sheep and 39,458 pounds in 1920. The industry
revived in the 1930s and reached a new high of 59,919 sheep and 336,494 pounds of wool in
1959. Mohair became a significant agricultural product by 1930 and reached a peak in 1959,
when 44,668 goats produced 209,098 pounds of mohair. Cotton, the second boom industry in
Williamson County, developed at about the same time as the cattle industry. As early as 1869,
the editor of the Georgetown Watchman was advising farmers to “make cotton, but do not, by any
means, neglect the grain crop-diversity.” Cotton production, which had been insignificant before
the war, rose to successive heights of 4,217 bales in 1880; 33,945 bales in 1890; and
80,514 bales in 1900. From 1900 to 1901, Williamson County ginned more cotton than any county
in Texas except Ellis County. The number of improved acres increased almost tenfold from 1870
to 1880 and doubled again to 306,881 acres by 1890. The proportion of cropland used for cotton

HJN 140262 AR

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

production moved from about one-third of the total in 1880 to a high of 77% in 1910, and cotton
was grown on 73% of the cropland as late as 1930. Dramatic changes in land tenure attended
the shift to cotton production. As late as 1880, 1183 of the 1538 farms, or 77%, were still worked
by owners. By 1890, only 43% of the farms were operated by owners, and the percentage of
owner-operators remained at 40% until the 1920s, when it dropped still further to 29% in 1930.
Farm tenancy rates began to decline during the Great Depression with the shift away from cotton
and other staple crops and by 1959 had dropped to 36% of the county’s farmers.
Both the cattle and the cotton booms were aided by the improved communications
available in the county in the later 19th century. The International-Great Northern Railroad, which
later was consolidated with the Missouri Pacific, was built across the eastern part of the county in
1876 and led to the founding of Taylor (now Williamson County’s third largest city) and Hutto and
to the relocation of Round Rock. It also opened up large areas in eastern Williamson County to
commercial farming. The Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railway, which was eventually
consolidated with the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway, was built in the 1880s and aided in
the development of Taylor, Granger, and Bartlett. Roads were generally poor throughout the
county in the early 20th century. There were 11,882 automobiles in the county by 1930, and
extensive improvements, including blacktopping, of all major roads took place in the 1930s.
The county also became more ethnically diverse in the later 19th and early 20th centuries.
While there were only 111 inhabitants of foreign birth out of a population of 6368 in Williamson
County in 1870, significant numbers of Scandinavians, Germans, Czechs, Wends, and Austrians
moved to the county in the 1880s and 1890s. The proportion of foreign-born in the county
population remained at about 10% from 1890 to the 1930s. Mexican immigration reached a
significant level by about 1910, just as Europeans stopped arriving in the county. There were
294 Hispanics in 1900, 732 in 1910, and 4967, or 11% of the population, in 1930. In 1980,
9693 residents, or again 11%, were of Hispanic origin. The immigrants added their distinctive
customs and architectural styles to the mix of county life and introduced new religious
denominations. By the time of the Civil War, Williamson County had a number of Baptist and
Methodist churches and several different factions of the Presbyterian Church. Churches of other
denominations were built after the war, and the new emigrants established Lutheran, Catholic,
and Czech Moravian congregations. By 1930, Williamson County had a culturally diverse
population of 44,146 inhabitants. The economy was still overwhelmingly agricultural; only 29
manufacturing establishments employed 347 workers that year. While cotton production was
near its peak in terms of percentage of cropland, the cotton industry was already undergoing a
rapid transformation.
The combined effects of soil depletion, overproduction, and the influx of the boll weevil
had already injured the profitability of the industry by the late 1920s, and the situation of cotton
growers was further worsened by the depression. The black population seems to have been
particularly hard hit by the depression. Of the 944 county families on relief in 1933, 442, almost
half, were black, though blacks constituted only 16% of the population. Various federal relief
programs benefited farmers with farm loans and subsidies, and in 1936 a total of $204,000 in
subsidy checks was issued. The Depression encouraged diversification among farmers and a
shift away from staple crops to livestock. Between 1930 and 1940, the number of acres used for

18

140262_arch_survey_report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the 7.0-Acre Frontier Park Improvement Project in Round
Rock, Williamson County, Texas

cotton-growing fell by almost half, and cotton production went from 68,266 to 36,890 bales.
Cropland acreage used for corn production increased over the same period by about half, and
wool and mohair production more than doubled to 342,983 and 102,517 pounds, respectively.
While cotton continued to be an important crop in eastern Williamson County, farmers increasingly
turned to other crops like sorghum and wheat and to livestock-raising in the latter 20th century.
Along with such traditional livestock as sheep and cattle, poultry farming played a significant role
in the economy by 1950, when the county was fifth in the state in the production of eggs and
chickens. In 1980, it was 10th in the state in the production of turkeys.
The agricultural diversification of the middle decades of the 20th century was followed by
significant social and economic changes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The black population,
which had remained at between 15 and 18% of the total in the early and mid-20th century, began
to decline, both proportionately and in real numbers, from the 1940s on and had fallen to 4111,
or about 5%, by 1980. As in other areas of Texas, blacks were relegated to segregated and
inferior housing and educational facilities until the 1960s, when some improvements were brought
about by federal desegregation policies. Along with changes in racial composition, Williamson
County experienced a dramatic increase in population during this period, growing from 37,305
inhabitants in 1970 to an estimated 85,700 inhabitants in 1982, making it 34th in population growth
among counties in the US in the 1970s.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

4.1

DATABASE REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Atlas) website indicated the presence of 7 previously recorded archeological sites and 1
cemetery within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (THC 2015), while a review of the
National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no
historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review radius (NPS 2015). These documented
cultural resources are summarized in Table 4-1, while their locations relative to the Project Area
are presented in Figure 4-1. One previously recorded site, 41WM442, is located within the central
portion of the Project Area. Site 41WM442 was originally recorded as a low-density prehistoric
lithic scatter. According to the Atlas, portions of the Project Area have been previously surveyed
for cultural resources. Two surveys, conducted in 1980 and 1999, documented the presence of
site 41WM442. Both surveys describe the low density of cultural materials associated with the
site and recommend the site as ineligible for formal designation as an SAL or for listing on the
NRHP.

4.2

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the Project Area on
an upland formation adjacent to a tributary feeder to Lake Creek, in conjunction with the presence
of numerous previously recorded prehistoric sites within the review radius and within the
boundaries of the Project Area, it was Horizon’s original opinion that there existed a high potential
for additional undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project
Area.
In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures in proximity to the Project
Area on the relevant topographic quadrangle map and on Google Earth suggested a decreased
potential for historic-era standing structures or associated cultural deposits within the limits of the
Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey of
the Project Area on 15 January 2015. This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing efforts. The TSMASS require a minimum of 2 shovel tests per 1.0 acres on projects
11.0 to 100.0 acres in size. As such, a total of 14 shovel tests were necessary on the 7.0-acre
Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey
standards by excavating 19 shovel tests within the boundaries of the Project Area. All excavated
matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.0-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowelsorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
In general, shovel tests measured approximately 12.0 in (30.0 cm) in diameter and were
excavated to a target depth of 3.3 ft (1.0 m) below ground surface, to the top of pre-Holocene
deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable. In practice, shovel tests were terminated at depths
of 3.9 to 11.8 in (10.0 to 30.0 cm) below surface due to the presence of pre-Holocene sediments
generally composed of clay loam, clay, and limestone gravels derived from decomposing
limestone. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld global positioning system
(GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 5-1, and shovel
test data are presented in Appendix A.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with the
potential to contain buried archeological materials at depths below those that shovel tests are
capable of reaching (approximately 3.3 ft [1.0 m] below surface). The Project Area is located in
an upland setting well away from alluvial terrace deposits, and the near-surface sediments in the
Project Area are composed of clay. While one intermittent stream crosses the Project Area, the
stream lacked an alluvial package; rather, it represented an erosional channel being cut into the
surrounding upland clays. Shovel testing revealed shallow clay sediments overlying limestone
gravels, indicating that shovel testing was capable of penetrating to the bottom of sediments
containing archeological deposits. As such, shovel testing is considered to constitute an
adequate and effective survey technique for identifying archeological resources within the Project
Area, and mechanical trenching was consequently not employed as a site-prospecting technique.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The cultural resources survey resulted in the reassessment of previously documented site
41WM442 within the Project Area. A detailed description of the site observed within the Project
Area is presented below.

6.1

SITE 41WM442 REVISIT
General Site Description

Site 41WM442 was originally recorded as a low-density, prehistoric lithic scatter during a
1980 survey of Southwest Park (now Frontier Park). In 1999, the site was revisited during a
survey conducted by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA). Based on the lack of diagnostic
artifacts and limited subsurface cultural deposits, the site was assessed by its original recorders
as ineligible for formal designation as an SAL and ineligible for inclusion on the NRHP. No further
investigations were recommended for the site.
Site 41WM442 is located approximately 150.0 ft (45.8 m) south of the intersection of
Chisholm Valley Drive and Frontier Trail in Round Rock, Texas (See Figure 4-1). The site is
situated adjacent to the banks of a small tributary feeder to Lake Creek at an elevation of
approximately 750.0 ft (228.6 m) amsl. Vegetation surrounding site 41WM442 consist of short
annual grasses with scattered oak and pine trees (Figures 6-1 and 6-2).
A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated within the vicinity of the originally recorded
centroid for the site. These shovel tests revealed shallow gravelly clay loam overlying clay and
yielded no subsurface cultural materials.
Observed Cultural Materials
Observed cultural materials on site 41WM442 consist a single tertiary flake (Figure 6-3).
The chert flake was manufactured from dark grayish-brown, medium- to fine-grained chert. No
temporally diagnostic tool fragments, thermally altered rocks, or preserved floral or faunal remains
were observed on site 41WM442. Five to 10 pieces of lithic debitage were observed on site
41WM442 during the 1980 and 1999 assessments of the site; however, these materials were not
observed during the current assessment of the site.

Figure 6-3. Chert flake observed on site 41WM442 within Project Area
Cultural Features
No evidence of any cultural features (e.g., hearths or burned rock middens) was observed
on the surface of the site or within any of the 6 shovel tests excavated on the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
During the 1999 survey assessment of site 41WM442, the recorders observed the site
boundaries to measure approximately 328.0 ft (100.0 m) east to west by 131.2 ft (40.0 m) north
to south. However, during the current assessment of site 41WM442, the originally recorded
boundaries could not be identified due to the paucity of cultural materials along the modern ground
surface and within excavated shovel tests
A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated during the revisit of site 41WM442. Shovel tests
revealed up to 11.8 inches (30.0 cm) of dark grayish-brown and reddish-brown clay loam overlying
dark reddish-brown and grayish-brown clay or limestone gravels. No cultural materials were
observed in subsurface contexts.
Site Summary
Site 41WM442 was originally recorded as a prehistoric lithic scatter located immediately
to the north of a tributary feeder to Lake Creek. The site originally consisted of a low-density
scatter of prehistoric lithic artifacts. However, only a single, tertiary flake was observed in surface
contexts during the current reassessment of site 41WM442. The originally delineated site

HJN 140262 AR

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

boundaries could not be reevaluated based upon the paucity of cultural materials along the
modern ground surface and within shovel tests. Given the low density of cultural materials and
the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, preserved floral/faunal remains, or
intact archeological deposits on the site, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41WM442 is ineligible for
formal designation as an SAL or inclusion on the NRHP. As such, no additional investigations
are recommended for site 41WM442 in connection with the currently proposed undertaking.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

The cultural resources survey resulted in the reassessment of 1 previously recorded site,
41WM442. Site 41WM442 was originally documented as a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter
near the central portion of the Project Area. However, only a single chert flake was observed
during the site reassessment, and the flake was restricted to surface contexts on the site. Six
shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of the originally documented site centroid for site
41WM442, all of which produced negative results. The originally delineated site boundaries could
not be reevaluated based upon the paucity of cultural materials along the modern ground surface
and within shovel tests. Given the low density of cultural materials and the lack of temporally
diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, preserved floral/faunal remains, or intact archeological
deposits on the site, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41WM442 is ineligible for formal designation
as an SAL or inclusion on the NRHP. As such, no additional investigations are recommended for
site 41WM442 in connection with the currently proposed undertaking.

7.2

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the survey-level results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed improvements
to the City of Round Rock’s Frontier Park Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for formal designation as SALs or eligible for listing
on the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends that the City of Round Rock be allowed to proceed
with the proposed improvements to Frontier Park relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT and Section
106 of the NHPA. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human
remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or
ongoing maintenance of the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the
location of the discovery should cease immediately, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
should be notified of the discovery
