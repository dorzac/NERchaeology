DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
Navidad Resources, LLC plans to construct four well pads for gas and oil
extraction, an access road, one riser station, and a gas pipeline in southwest
Houston County (Figure 1). When constructed, the well pads will be 250 feet by
250 feet in size, the access road will be 703 feet in length, the riser station will
occupy a two-acre tract, and the pipeline will be 9100 feet in length (four inches
in diameter and placed in a trench three feet deep and less than two feet wide).
The project area is depicted on the USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangles Baker
Lake (3095-343), Weldon (3195-211), and Wyser Bottom (3095-344). Due to the
size of the project area, it is depicted on two maps. Figure 2 depicts the eastern
portion of the project area on the Baker Lake, Weldon, and Wyser Bottom maps,
and Figure 3 depicts the western portion of the project area on the Baker Lake
map.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the project area. The client is Navidad Resources, LLC.
of Tyler, Texas. BVRA was retained by the client to perform an archaeological
survey as requested by the Texas Historical Commission in a letter dated July 9,
2010 to Daniel E. George of Navidad Resources, LLC. The Principal Investigator
was William E. Moore. Edward P. Baxter was the Project Archaeologist, and he
was assisted by Phillip C. Bishop. The field survey involved 32 person hours and
was performed on July 15-16 2010. The reviewing agency is the Texas Historical
Commission, Archeology Division.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, the site records at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas were
checked for the presence of previously recorded sites and other archaeological
surveys in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports
documenting work in Houston County were reviewed in order to become familiar
with the types of prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. The most relevant
source for this project is a report by Archeological and Environmental Consultants
of Austin (Perttula and Prikryl 1997) that documents work done in the immediate
area. Their findings are discussed in the Results section below. Other reports
reviewed include two projects conducted at the Eastham Unit by BVRA (Moore
2008a, 2008b).
The current project area was investigated by a surface inspection, twenty-six
shovel tests, and three backhoe trenches. Shovel tests were dug to sterile clay
when possible. The majority of shovel tests were excavated in areas where clay
was present at or near the surface. Twenty-three of the tests were terminated at
depths of 20 cm or less. The remainder were dug to 25, 30, and 45 cm before clay
was encountered. Areas shovel tested include three well pad locations and the twoacre tract. The route of the proposed pipeline was examined through a surface
inspection. Excavated earth from the tests was screened using ¼ inch hardware
cloth, and the results documented on a shovel test log (Appendix I). Backhoe
trenches were excavated at all three well pads. They are described in Appendix II
(Backhoe Trench Descriptions). Details of work at each well location are provided
below.
Well Location 1-1
The size of this well as proposed by the client is 250 feet by 250 feet. At the
time of this survey, the surface was in pasture. The surface was visually inspected,
and the subsurface was examined by five shovel tests and one backhoe trench.
The shovel tests were dug at the drill hole and each corner of the proposed well
site, and the backhoe trench was dug along the eastern boundary approximately
equidistant from shovel tests 18 and 19 (Figure 4).
Well Location 4-1
The size of this well as proposed by the client is 250 feet by 250 feet. At the
time of this survey, the surface was in pasture. The surface was visually inspected,
and the subsurface was examined by six shovel tests and one backhoe trench.
The shovel tests were dug at the drill hole, each corner of the proposed well site,
and between shovel tests 1 and 5. The backhoe trench was dug in the northeast
corner and southwest of Shovel Test 4 (Figure 5).

Well Location 6-1
The size of this well as proposed by the client is 250 x 250 feet. At the time
of this survey, the area was in pasture. The proposed location for this well was very
near previously recorded prehistoric site 41HO183. In order to avoid this site, the
well location was moved 1700 feet to the north-northwest to be placed in an area
where the sandy soil had been removed in order to mine for clay to be used
elsewhere on the prison grounds such as road construction (Figure 6). According
to Jimmy Estridge (personal communication), who works for Navidad Resources,
the clay is being removed by scraping, and this process is still in progress. The
new well location had been previously surveyed by Perttula and Prikryl (1997) and
may be within the boundaries of site 41HO187. This site was recorded on the basis
of five pieces of debitage identified as chert, silicified wood, and quartzite. It is a
low-density site, especially when quartzite and silicified wood are often incorrectly
identified as cultural. In addition, the depth of soil over clay in this area was found to
be shallow at 40 cm during the survey by Perttula and Prikryl, and the recorders
referred to this site as having little research potential. If the 6-1 well location is
placed in this area, no cultural resources will be affected. Due to the disturbed
nature of this new location, it was not necessary to excavate shovel tests or
backhoe trenches. The location was visually inspected, and the surface was found
to consist of hard orange clay.
Well Location C-1
The size of this well as proposed by the client is 250 feet by 250 feet. At the
time of this survey, the surface was in pasture. The surface was visually inspected,
and the subsurface was examined by seven shovel tests and one backhoe trench.
The shovel tests were dug at the drill hole, each corner of the proposed well,
between shovel tests 10 and 12, and between shovel tests 9 and 14. The backhoe
trench was dug along the southern boundary between shovel tests 14 and 15
(Figure 7). This location is in the vicinity of a historic cemetery (41HO213) that
contains the remains of convicts. The northeast corner of the cemetery is 350 feet
from the southwest corner of the well location.
Riser Station
The size of this tract as proposed by the client is two acres, and it is the
future location for a riser station. At the time of this survey, the surface was in
pasture. Riser stations are areas that will eventually contain gas-processing
equipment such as inlet risers; outlet risers; and a series of valves, pipes and other
types of equipment placed strategically about the tract that will contain produced
natural gas from the prison wells. The surface was visually inspected, and the
subsurface was examined by six shovel tests (Figure 8). The shovel tests were
dug at the center of the tract, each corner of the proposed well, and in the
approximate middle of the southern boundary. No backhoe trenches were dug
because the area was clay at the surface.

Access Road
One access road will be constructed from a gravel prison road (not named)
to well location 4-1. The length of the proposed road is 703 feet, and it will be about
50 feet wide. This road will be constructed by adding gravel to the existing surface.
Two shovel tests were dug along this road (Figure 5). No backhoe trenches were
dug because of clay at the surface and there will be no disturbance below the
ground surface.
Pipeline
The length of the pipeline as currently proposed is 9100 feet. It will be
placed in a trench approximately three feet deep and less than two feet wide. It was
investigated by a surface inspection and numerous shovel probes that revealed
clay at the surface. The ground cover at the time consisted of pasture and had
been plowed.

RESULTS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed two
previously recorded prehistoric sites (41HO183 and 41HO213) had been recorded
in close proximity to the original project area. Site 41HO183 is a Late Prehistoric
site that yielded numerous artifacts including a Catahoula arrow point, ceramics
that were tempered with sand and bone and grog, debitage, bone, and mussel
shell. The site will be designated as a State Archeological Landmark. Because of
the proximity of the proposed well location 6-1 to this site, the well location was
moved to the north-northwest to an area that had been disturbed by the removal of
sand and clay by the prison and in an area that had been subjected to a previous
survey by professional archaeologists. As stated above, the new location may be
within the boundaries of prehistoric site 41HO187, a site that was determined to
have little or no research potential. This new location, however, has been disturbed
to the point that no cultural significance remains. Historic site 41HO213 is a
cemetery that contains the remains of convicts, and it is located in the vicinity of
well location C-1. The northeast corner of the cemetery is 350 feet from the
southwest corner of the well location. There are two plottings on the Archeological
Sites Atlas for this site. One is a large rectangle that bears the TARL trinomial
41HO213, and just to the north is a smaller area marking the location of a historic
cemetery. According to the official website of the Texas Historical Commission, this
cemetery is known as the Eastham Convicts Cemetery, and it has their cemetery
number (HO-C328). The cemetery is fenced. The survey crew took GPS readings
at each corner, and used these readings to plot the location of the cemetery on the
map in this report. The footprint of the pipeline as currently proposed is north of the
cemetery, and the closest portion is 545 feet distant. Therefore, construction of the
pipeline and C-1 well should not affect this historic cemetery. The field survey did
not locate any cultural resources, prehistoric or historic. Most of the project area
was in pasture or short grass. Soils in the project area consist mainly of clay at or
near the surface. No sandy loam or fine sandy loam was encountered, and the soil
just above the clay is sandy clay loam.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No evidence of a prehistoric or historic site was found as a result of this
survey. It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction
as planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the
construction of the road, all work must stop until the Texas Historical Commission
can evaluate the situation. This survey was conducted in accordance with the
Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas Historical Commission.

APPENDIX II
BACKHOE TRENCH DESCRIPTIONS
Backhoe Trench 1 was excavated at Well Location 1-1 at the edge of the
proposed well pad closest to the road because the backhoe was in danger of breaking
through the thin dry crust of the black gumbo bottomland clay and sinking. At the time
of this investigation, the area was in pasture that had been disturbed by plowing. The
size of this trench was 1 meter wide, 6 meters long, and .6 meter deep, It was oriented
in a north-northwest/south-southeast direction. The trench was shallow due to the
presence of dark black wet clay with water seeping into the trench bottom, and only two
strata or zones were identified. Zone I (surface to 15 cm) was in the plow zone and
consisted of dark brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay loam. Zone II (15 cm to 60 cm) consisted
of dark (10YR 2/2) hard-packed wet clay. No cultural features were observed in the
trench profiles.
Backhoe Trench 2 was excavated at Well Location 4-1 in the area where the
reserve pit of the proposed well is to be placed. At the time of this investigation, this
area was in pasture. The size of the trench was 1 meter in wide, 8 meters long, and
1.75 meters deep. The trench was orientated in a northwest-southeast direction. The
surface in this area had been disturbed by plowing for pasture improvements. Four
different strata or zones were identified. Zone I (surface to 50 cm) consisted of hard
packed dark brown silty clay (10YR 4/2). Zone II (50 cm to 95 cm) consisted of mottled
brown (10YR 5/2) clay. The color of the mottles were identified by the Munsell Chart as
10YR 5/6. Zone III (95 cm to 150 cm) consisted of hard dark brown (10YR 4/2) clay.
Zone IV (150 cm to the bottom of the trench) consisted of hard brown (10YR 5/2) clay.
No cultural features were observed in the trench profiles.
Backhoe Trench 3 was excavated at Well Location C-1 in an area near the site of
the proposed reserve pit. At the time of this investigation, the area was in pasture. The
size of the trench was 1 meter wide, 9 meters long, and 1.15 meters deep. It was
oriented in an east-west direction. Four strata or zones were identified. Zone I (surface
to 15 cm) consisted of brown (10YR 5/2) sandy clay loam. Zone II (18 cm to 30 cm)
consisted of hard packed mottled brown clay (10YR 4/6). The color of the mottles were
identified by the Munsell Chart as 10YR 4/4. Zone III (30 cm to 98 cm) consisted of hard
light brown clay (10YR 5/3) with mottles ( 5YR 4/4). Zone IV (98 cm to the bottom of
the trench) consisted of hard grayish-brown (10YR 5/1) clay. No cultural features were
observed in the trench profiles.
