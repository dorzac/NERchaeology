On July 11, 1976, an on-fQot inspection of the proposed 310
acre sanitary landfill ai Camp Sw~ft, Bastrop County, Texas,
was carried out by the writer. This inspection was preceded
by a review of the existing published archeological literature
pertinent to this region of the State and a study of the Bastrop
County records on file at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin. Additionally,
the mapped surficial geology of the region was reviewed.* Sub­
sequent to the field survey, consultations were carried out with
the staff of the State Historical Commission in regard to possible
National Register properties on or near the area to be affected.
This consultation indicated that no sites or districts listed on,
or currently under consideration for, the National Register of
Historic Places exist in the project area.
The area proposed for the sanitary landfill development is
situated approximately 4 miles SSE of the town of Elgin, Texas;
it is bounded on the north by the northern bound~ry of the Camp­
Swift Military Reservation and on tne west by State Highway 95.
Topographically the area,is rolling to hilly and dominated by a
segment of the incised drainage of Dogwood Creek, a tributary of
Big Sandy Creek. The vegetation inc'ludes mixed forest, mostly
oak, with moderately dense understofy plus intervening areas of
grassy cover. The heavily vegetated land surface considerably
reduced archeological visibility during the course of this survey.
#

Inspection of the area was accomplished by walking four transects
generally paralleling the long axis of the study area. Also,
occasional diagonal transects were made between these lines to
further reduce the possibility of missing visible cultural
features. The results of this on-site inspection were largely
negative. With the exception of a single unifacially flaked
implement of coarse grained chert observed along the Coastal
States Gas Company pipeline which bisects the study area, no
artifacts or features of archeological interest were observed.
Features of historic age were rare and appeared to be of no
interpretive or aesthetic value.

A number of probably significant archeological sites from this
general region are currently recorded in the Bastrop County files
of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory. Most of these
are situated along Wilbarger and Big Sandy Creeks; west and
southwest of the study area, and associated with the terrace
system of the Colorado River. No site recordings, however, have
been made in the project area.
On the basis of the literature search and on-site survey sum­
marized above, no archeological sites or historic sites of
significance could be demonstrated to ~xist in the project area.
Because, however, of the heavy ground cover and the possibility
of buried sites existing there, it is strongly recommended that
features or artifacts of possible archeological importance un­
covered during land modifications associated with this project
development be reported promptly to the offices of the State
Historical Commission. This precaution, in my opinion, is .
.
especially pertinent to the unconsolidated sand deposits border­
ing Dogwood Creek.
