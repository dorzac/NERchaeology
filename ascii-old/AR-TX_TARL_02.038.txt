MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
The Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at The University of Texas at Austin entered into a contract with the
U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District (hereafter COE) in 1997 to reassess nine previously identified archeological sites along a segment of the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) between Morgan's Point and the lower reaches of Buffalo
Bayou. From south to north, the sites included are 41HR685 (Atkinson Island), 41HR681 (southern shore of Hog Island),
41HR680 (Spilmans Island), 41HR405 (Goat or St. Mary's Island), 41HR577 (on the northwest bank of Buffalo Bayou just
upstream from Carpenters Bayou), and a group of four sites (4lHR121, 41HR33, 41HR104, and 41HR105) along the southeast
bank of Buffalo Bayou, upstream from the San Jacinto Battlefield State Park. These nine sites were selected from comprehensive lists of prehistoric and historic sites in the project area (Foster et al. 1993; Kibler et al. 1996). They were believed to be the
most likely locations for finding significant, intact archeological deposits within the zone of possible adverse impacts
resulting from planned navigational improvements to the HSC. Consequently, the sites required additional archeological
evaluation before that construction effort could proceed.
The survey portion of the TARL fieldwork was conducted in June and July 1997. TARL field investigations included
archeological and geomorphological assessment of each locality. Methods included formal and informal pedestrian survey,
shovel probes, shovel tests, auger probes, and test excavation units. Laboratory and nonfield investigations included a
review of available aerial photographs and historical maps, as well as examination of existing collections, fieldnotes, and
photographs pertaining to the sites on file at TARL and elsewhere. Georectified overlay maps were made for each locality to
aid in assessing the extent of shoreline change. During the course of this research, numerous historical records and sources
were consulted. In several cases, they proved to be crucial for understanding historical occupation(s) of the immediate site
areas as well as the extent of landscape modifications that have occurred. In some cases, additional data regarding historic
occupations or events were collected which complement information presented in previous historical studies in the project
area (Hoyt et al. 1998; Kibler et al. 1996; Schmidt and Foster 1997).
Based on initial field results, the original contract was modified to accomplish additional testing in the spring of 1998 at one
locality (41HR121 ); a thin Rangia shell midden. This testing confirmed that at least one component of a previously recorded
historical site (41HR576) partially overlaps and overlies buried prehistoric site 41HR121. Documentary and historical evidence suggests that other portions of 41HR576 may have significant research potential and fall within the zone of adverse
impact from channel modification. It was therefore effectively added as a tenth site in the TARL resurvey. This report
summarizes the results of TARL field and laboratory research of new and existing data from all 10 sites and outlines
recommendations for further future research.
Extensive landscape changes have occurred in the project area due to both natural and cultural factors. Natural processes of
erosion and deposition are exacerbated by frequent hurricanes and flooding. Human impacts in the last 120 or so years have
been equally if not more profound: massive shoreline erosion from shipwakes within the narrow confines of Buffalo Bayou
and the lower San Jacinto River; subsidence from to the extraction of geofluids; industrial development and shoreline
constructions; and finally extensive dredging related to construction and maintenance of the HSC. The latter includes the
deposition of dredged material on existing landforms or which created entirely new madeland. Results of the TARL resurvey
and reassessment demonstrated that eight of the original nine sites were either destroyed by erosion, subsided beneath the
modern waterline, or incorrectly identified as intact archeological sites (i.e., "pseudosites"). Only a small, upslope extension
of one site (41HR121) on the southeast bank of Buffalo Bayou just upstream from the San Jacinto Battlefield State Park was
found to be intact. It is a thin, buried lens of Rangia shell and associated cultural material representing the remains of one or
a few individual occupation(s) during the early part of the Ceramic Period; that is, the Clear Lake, or possibly Mayes Island,
period in the Galveston Bay ceramic chronology (Aten 1983a). As mentioned, a portion of an historical site (41HR576)
partially overlies, but was clearly separated from, this buried prehistoric deposit. The research potential of both 41HR121 and
portions of 41HR576 is considered significant. Additional archeological and historical investigations at these two sites, as
outlined below, are recommended to mitigate adverse impacts of planned HSC modifications. No additional research is
recommended for the remaining eight site localities.
In addition to fieldwork and archival investigations, TARL research also focused on the extensive records, photographs, and
cultural materials from the selected sites; including at least 40 partial vessels from 41HR33 in the Neyland Collection now
curated at TARL. These and other data from sites in and around the project area that no longer exist offer a unique
opportunity to contribute to our understanding of the prehistory of the Upper Galveston Bay. As stipulated in the scope of

XI

--------~

work for the current project, the Neyland collection materials have been inventoried and preliminary analyses conducted,
with particular emphasis on the 41HR33 ceramic collection. Recommendations for additional research utilizing existing
collections at TARL and elsewhere are considered. They include using the 41HR33 vessel data as the starting point for a
baseline ceramic study of the Galveston Bay area. If such a study were undertaken, it should integrate and build on previous
research (e.g., Howard's [ 1990] analysis of the Worthington Site [41HR124] collection from Peggy Lake) as well as an attempt
to obtain as much information as possible from privately held collections. By concentrating on whole or nearly complete
vessels (and the relationships between attributes of form, function, manufacture, decoration, and distribution), it may be
possible to identify or develop criteria to assist in evaluating the far more common archeological collections limited only to
loose sherds. The proposed research would serve the dual purpose of significantly adding to our understanding of the
Upper Texas Coast (UTC) prehistory while at the same time providing the COE a baseline of ceramic data to guide future work
in the study area.
This report is organized as follows. The first chapter serves as an overview of the project and an introduction to UTC
archeological and historical research. Chapters two through four provide background information on the geology, natural
environment, and cultural occupations, respectively. The fifth chapter discusses selected archeological and historical
investigations that have previously been conducted in and around the project area and identifies a number of research topics
pertinent to the current study. Chapter six describes the geomorphology, previous investigations, and TARL research at five
site localities (41HR405, 41HR577, 41HR680, 41HR681, and 41HR685). The seventh chapter addresses sites along the
shoreline and upland margin of the southeastern bank of Buffalo Bayou, including the four prehistoric Neyland sites
reported in the 1950s (41HR33, 41HR104, 41HR105, and41HR121) and the multicomponent historic site (41HR576). Chapter
7 may be conveniently divided into three major sections beginning with a review of Ney land's investigations and TARL's
analyses of existing records and collections, followed by a presentation of the results of the resurvey of this area in the
summer of 1997, and concludes with a report on the advanced or additional testing at 41 HR12 l and 41 HR576 in the spring of
1998. This includes a related discussion of the locations and potential components of historical site 41 HR576. Conclusions
about each site's integrity and research potential are provided in the final chapter along with recommendations for or against
additional archeological research.
The report concludes with a number of appendices detailing the analysis of material classes, special samples, and other
relevant data, authored by the individual analysts. They include studies of the lithics, ceramics, modified bone artifacts, and
historic materials in the Neyland Collection or recovered by TARL (Appendices C, D, E, and F, respectively). Appendix G
covers analysis of the non-tool fauna! material and Appendix H reports the results of micromorphological analysis of
sediments. Appendices I, J, K, and L detail studies of phytoliths and diatoms, pollen, ostracodes, and invertebrate fauna
(shell), respectively. The next two appendices itemize miscellaneous materials recovered from 41HR33 (Appendix M) and
photographs and notebook records (Appendix N) in the Neyland Collection. The latter includes an annotated summary of
daily entries and correspondence by Neyland detailing his investigations at sites along the southeastern bank of Buffalo
Bayou between 1957 and 1959.
Writing responsibilities of the various chapters were as follows: Paine wrote Chapter 2 in its entirety and carefully reviewed
relevant sections of Chapters 6 and 7. Collins contributed to early drafts of parts of Chapters 1 and 3, which were subsequently expanded and completed by Takac. The remainder of the report was written exclusively by Takac. Russ Brownlow
assisted in the compilation of tables and data provided in Appendix B. Authorship of the individual appendices to this report
are as listed. The report was edited by Jerrilyn B. McLerran, illustrated by Robin Benson, and produced by Mary Jo Galindo.

INTRODUCTION

PROJECfDESCRIPTION
On April 20, 1836, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna
and a division of the Mexican Army under his direct command marched from New Washington, near present-day
Morgans Point, to a broad plain below the confluence of the
San Jacinto River and Buffalo Bayou. The next day, Santa
Anna and his forces were defeated by a smaller contingent
of Texans led by General Sam Houston in the decisive victory of the Texas Revolution. In the summer of 1997, over
160 years later, personnel of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) undertook a resurvey of nine archeological sites along the lower Houston Ship Channel
between these historic localities on behalf of and under contract to the Environmental Resources Branch of the
Galveston District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE).
This effort to determine eligibility of these sites for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places was made in
anticipation of adverse impacts resulting from planned navigational improvements to the ship channel and subject to
review under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966. An additional program of testing
was subsequently undertaken at one of these sites, as well
as an adjacent historic site not included in the original survey, in the spring of 1998. Here we briefly introduce the
project area, the circumstances that led to selection of these
particular sites for resurvey, and the objectives of this survey and testing. This project was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 1846 applying NHPA significance criteria (36 CPR Part 60.4 and National Park Service, 1991 ). These
investigations were performed under Delivery Order No. 1
of Contract No. DACW64-96-D-0005 and Modification No.
1 thereof.

The Project Area
This project is concerned with nine archeological sites
located along a portion of the Houston Ship Channel be-

tween Morgans Point and the mouth of Buffalo Bayou (Figure 1). This stretch of the ship channel winds it way through
an estuarial zone that includes several small embayments
(Burnet, Scott, Black Duck, Tabbs, and San Jacinto Bays
and Peggy and Crystal Lakes), beginning near the complex
confluence of Buffalo Bayou with Carpenters Bayou, Old
River, and the San Jacinto River and continuing downstream
to where the San Jacinto River enters the northwestern margin of Galveston Bay, a channel distance of some 16 km (9.7
mi). The San Jacinto Battlefield State Park with its obeliskstyle monument is the most prominent landmark near the
upstream end of the project area, and Morgans Point with its
man-made channel linking the open waters of Galveston Bay
and the estuarial labyrinth of the lower San Jacinto River is
the distinguishing feature at the downstream end of the
project area.
The natural character of this area is a low relief coastal
plain across which several sluggish, meandering drainages
flow in low-walled valleys. In the immediate project area,
rising sea level during the Holocene has drowned oncedeeper valleys cut into Pleistocene fluvial-deltaic sediments,
known collectively as the Beaumont Formation. These deeper
valleys were cut by streams that had steeper gradients during glacial times when sea levels were lower. This natural
encroachment of the sea into the lower San Jacinto drainage
has been exacerbated in recent decades by subsidence
brought about by removal of oil, gas, and groundwater via
numerous wells. Subsidence has been particularly severe at
either end of the project area. Localized areas of subsidence
on the order of several meters over the previous 75 years or
so are located near the Lynchburg/San Jacinto area at the
upstream end of the project area and in the vicinity of
Baytown and Goose Creek near Morgans Point. Coupled
with natural erosive processes such as storms and flooding
as well as those caused artificially by shipwakes and shoreline constructions, this extensive subsidence has resulted
in shoreline changes (mainly loss) of up to several hundred
meters. Furthermore, extensive industrial development, in-

eluding major port facilities, along and near the channel has
caused further distortion of the natural landscape. Finally,
beginning more than 120 years ago, repeated episodes of
dredging and the stockpiling and disposal of dredged materials along the channel margins have been an additional
source of geomorphic alteration. This activity will continue
as the planned navigational improvement project entails widening and deepening the ship channel. The combined effects of subsidence, erosion, dredging, and industrial development past and future are particularly germane to the present
archeological research project.

The Sites
Nine of the 10 sites examined in the course of this project
were included in the original work order. These nine prehistoric sites are situated in areas to be adversely impacted by
planned channel modifications and considered to be the
best candidates for having intact deposits and demonstrable
research potential. They were selected from comprehensive
lists of historic and prehistoric sites recommended for further evaluation in two recent COE-sponsored planning documents (Foster et al. 1993; Kibler et al. 1996). The tenth site (a
multicomponent historic site) was found to partially overlap
one of the original nine and was therefore included in the
study. The present study complements a separate evaluation of promising historic localities (Schmidt and Foster 1999).
From north to south the original nine sites are
41HR33, 41HR104, 41HR105, and 41HR121 on the descending right (southeast) bank of the ship channel (Buffalo Bayou segment) immediately upstream from the San
Jacinto Monument (see Figure 1); 41HR577 on the left
(northwest) bank of Buffalo Bayou, opposite the four
sites just listed; 41HR405 on Goat Island (a.k.a. St Mary's
Island) on the left (north) margin of the ship channel
fronting Scott Bay; 41HR680 on Spilmans Island on the
right (south) channel margin farther downstream;
41HR681 at the southeastern end of Hog Island on the
left shore of both the main ship channel and the Cedar
Bayou Channel segment (the original route of the historical San Jacinto River); and finally, directly across the
latter channel, 41HR685 on Atkinson Island, created by
the nineteenth-century bisection of a natural peninsula
that formerly was the right (south) bank of the San Jacinto
River before it entered Upper Galveston Bay. All were
considered prehistoric sites except 41HR685, which was
reported to have both a prehistoric and an historic component. However, a few were later found to have potential historic components as well. This includes a multicomponent historic site (41HR576) that lies on the southeast valley margin of Buffalo Bayou southwest of the
San Jacinto Battlefield State Park. One component of this
site partially overlies a more deeply buried remnant of
prehistoric site 41HR121. It was therefore effectively
added as the tenth site in the TARL resurvey.

PROJECTOBJECTIVF.SAND OVERVIEW
National Register of Historic Places eligibility affords
protection to sites in the form of avoidance, protection, or
mitigation through data recovery. To be eligible for listing
on the National Register of Historic Places, a cultural property ("site") must be significant in American history, architecture, engineering, or culture (National Park Service 1991).
Siginificant sites possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association, and
(a) are associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of our history; (b) are
associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
(c) embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period,
or method of construction, or that represent the works of a
master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent
a significant and distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or (d) have yielded or may
be likely to yield information important in prehistory or history (National Park Service 1991 ). Prehistoric archeological
sites eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places are almost always nominated under Criterion D.
The scope of work for the present study stipulates that
for each site (including 41HR576), the primary objectives are
to determine its integrity, horizontal extent, geologic context, nature of cultural content, and age. Documentation for
each site is also to be updated, noting in particular any
changes in condition or assessment since the site was discovered or last documented. In the case of sites for which
previous archeological collections exist, additional objectives include reviewing those collections and their associated documentation to determine if useful information could
be derived from further study of them. Site formation and
preservation in the project area is highly dependent on geologic conditions and processes, and all of the investigations
have been conducted from an explicitly geoarcheological
perspective. It is especially important to reliably distinguish
natural, stratified in situ deposits from recent landforms or
redeposited layers of dredged sediment, both of which can
resemble natural strata and shell middens. Difficulty in site
recognition and evaluation is compounded by the rapid development of modem soils in dredged sediments and by the
presence of redeposited site materials, including artifacts
and shell.
As it developed, determining site integrity became the
principal task of this resurvey. Eight of the nine sites were
found (1) to be natural or dredge deposits with shell and
artifacts (resembling cultural shell middens) that were incorrectly identified as intact archeological sites (i.e.,
"pseudosites"), or (2) to have been completely destroyed
by erosion or subsided beneath the waterline so that no
intact artifact-bearing deposits remain reasonably accessible.
Only a small, upslope extension of one site (41HR121) on the
southeast bank of Buffalo Bayou (see Figure 1) was found

4

to be an intact prehistoric site. It is a thin, buried lens of
intact Rangia shell and associated cultural material believed
to represent the remains of one or a few individual early
Ceramic period occupations. As mentioned, a multicomponent historic site (41HR576) partially overlies, but is
stratigraphically separated from, the buried shell lens. That
portion of 41HR121 originally defined nearly 40 years ago,
like the other three sites along the same stretch of Buffalo
Bayou (41HR33, 41HR104, and 41HR105) has been completely eroded or subsided. Sites 41HR121and41HR576 are
located on the valley margin and adjacent upland within a
small plot of land that, with the exception of the recent emplacement of a large waterline, has remained relatively undeveloped and undisturbed over the last 50-plus years. Their
preservation is a direct consequence of this fortuitous placement.
Sites along the southeastern bank of Buffalo Bayou
were recorded and investigated between 1957 and 1959 by
Wayne B. Neyland, an avocational archeologist and founding member of the Houston Archeological Society. Neyland
conducted extensive investigations of 41HR33 until 1959
when erosion along this segment of the Houston Ship Channel had progressed to the point where these sites (including
41HR121) were largely destroyed. Neyland's records show
that 41HR33 consisted of multiple shell lenses, lithics, and
abundant ceramics. At least 40 partially restorable vessel
sections are among the materials collected by Neyland. The
artifact collections, photographs, and field notes made by
Neyland at all of the sites he recorded along the southeast
bank of Buffalo Bayou were examined closely during this

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

study and are summarized and reported herein.
In compliance with the original scope of work, limited
testing to determine site extent, cultural content, age, integrity, and geologic context was conducted at the upslope
remnant of 41HR121 during June and July 1997. Over 40
subsurface probes or tests and 2 test units were excavated.
They indicated that intact, discrete cultural deposits might
be found over an area of up to 350 m2 â¢ The site was judged to
be potentially eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places.
Because of the scarcity of intact sites surviving in the
project area and the apparent research potential and significance of 41HR121, the existing contract between COE and
TARL was modified in January 1998 to enable more-complete testing of this site. This was done in March and April
1998 by excavating six additional test units, three more shovel
tests, and a long, narrow trench. This supplemental testing
served the dual purposes of refining our understanding of
the site while also evaluating what data recovery strategies
would be most effective should full-scale excavation be warranted. This effort, as well as the initial testing, also involved
a portion of site 41HR576. Subsequent archival and cartographic research suggests that 41HR576 may have significant research potential related to one or more of its historic
components. However, the small portion of 41HR576 that
partially overlies 41HR121 is not considered significant and
does not merit further investigation. A complete report on
both phases of testing at sites 41HR121 and 41HR576 is
included in the present report.

GEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND

GEOLOGICAL OVERVIEW

roughly 107,000 to 128,000 B.P. (lmbrie et al. 1984; Moore
1982).
The second event, the weathering and erosion of the
Beaumont, probably began during the Wisconsin glaciation, when rivers began cutting valleys in response to a sea
level that was as low as 90 to 160 m below present level
(Paine 1991). Rehkemper (1969) estimates that the ancestral
San Jacinto River was entrenched about 20 ft below present
sea level near the confluence with Buffalo Bayou and between 20 and 40 ft near Morgans Point (i.e., the limits of the
current project area, see Figure 1). Recent borings conducted
for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers suggest somewhat
deeper valley excavation in lower Buffalo Bayou near the
confluence with the San Jacinto River (Carolyn Murphy,
personal communication 1998). Soft to very soft clays with
high moisture contents are encountered beneath Buffalo
Bayou to elevations as low as 33 ft below mean low tide,
where the soft clays rest on stiff sandy clays with much
lower moisture contents. The abrupt increase in stiffness
and decrease in moisture content probably coincide with an
unconformity on the eroded Beaumont surface.

The Buffalo Bayou and San Jacinto Bay areas evolved
into their present form through a series of depositional, weathering, and erosional events related to large-scale fluctuations of sea level in the late Pleistocene and Holocene. The
general environment changed from largely depositional during the last Pleistocene interglacial stage (Sangamonian, or
oxygen isotope stage 5e), to nondepositional or erosional
during the last Pleistocene glacial stage (Wisconsinan, or
oxygen isotope stages 2 to 5d), to a depositional/erosional
mix during the Holocene (oxygen isotope stage 1).
Late Pleistocene

At least two late Pleistocene events influenced the
present configuration of Buffalo Bayou and San Jacinto Bay.
The first event is represented by clays, silts, and sands assigned to the Beaumont Formation, which forms the upland
and underlies Holocene valley-fill deposits. The Beaumont
Formation, named by Hayes and Kennedy (1903), is interpreted as a laterally extensive fluvial-deltaic complex deposited during a sea-level highstand in the late Pleistocene
(Aronow 1971;Barton 1930;Davis 1970;Fisheretal.1972).
According to Barton ( 1930) and Rehkemper ( 1969), Galveston
Bay represents a reentrant between two major fluvial-deltaic
lobes, the ancestral Trinity to the northeast and the ancestral Brazos to the southwest. The regional dip of the Beaumont is to the southeast, but the upland surface between
lower Buffalo Bayou and Morgans Point has a gentle dip
ranging from northeast to southeast. Sediments on the
southern flank of Buffalo Bayou and San Jacinto Bay were
probably transported by easterly to northeasterly flowing
channels of the ancestral Brazos River. Beaumont deposits
have not been reliably dated, but they are at least 30,000 to
40,000 years old (Aronow 1971), and the upper part most
likely dates to the Sangamonian (Winker 1979a, 1979b), at

Holocene

The end of the Wisconsin glaciation resulted in a worldwide rise in sea level during the late Pleistocene and early
Holocene. As sea level rose, the shoreline migrated landward from its position near the edge of the continental shelf,
and incised valleys began filling with fluvial, deltaic, and
estuarine deposits. The soft sediments encountered in the
Buffalo Bayou borings most likely represent Holocene fluvial, deltaic, and estuarine deposits; these recent sediments
were deposited on the Beaumont erosional unconformity.
Because sea level has not exceeded the height of the upland
areas since the Pleistocene, Buffalo Bayou and the San
Jacinto River and their Holocene fluvial, deltaic, and estuarine deposits are confined within Pleistocene valley walls. In

5

6

contrast to relatively rapid deposition on the valley floor,
upland areas primarily have been weathered or have eroded
throughout the Holocene. The presence of meander scars
on the valley margins indicate that both Buffalo Bayou and
the San Jacinto River have widened their valleys by lateral
migration during the Holocene.
Much effort has been expended toward understanding
the relationship between late Pleistocene and Holocene sea
level and terrace development along the Trinity River (Aten
1979, 1983a). As a result, six distinct terraces have been
identified: three probable Beaumont terraces, two
"Deweyville," or latest Pleistocene/earliest Holocene terraces, and the modern terrace (Aten 1979, 1983a). Although
the drainage basin of the San Jacinto River (about 3,000 mi2,
Dougherty 1980) is considerably smaller than that of the
Trinity, a similarly complex terrace stratigraphy probably exists. Evidence of only two terraces is found at the surface
between the Buffalo Bayou/San Jacinto River confluence
and Morgans Point. The upland is the older of the two terraces and represents latest Beaumont deposition; the
younger terrace is represented by partly to mostly submerged
levee and floodplain deposits of the San Jacinto River and is
separated from the Beaumont terrace by meander scars. Although "Deweyville" terraces have been mapped farther
upstream (Barnes 1968), evidence of these terraces between
the Buffalo Bayou confluence and Morgans Point is either
submerged or removed by subsequent channel migration.
Emergent Holocene point bar, levee, and floodplain deposits are evident on maps and aerial photographs oflower
Buffalo Bayou made between 1900 and the 1950s. Subsidence and shoreline erosion that has been exacerbated by
Houston Ship Channel traffic has caused these deposits to
be either eroded or submerged in the project area and has
caused retreat of the Pleistocene bluffs at the bayou margin.
Natural geological processes that might affect the integrity of archeological sites in the project area include natural
compactional subsidence, rising sea level, frequent river
flooding of Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River, and
extremely high tides during passage of tropical cyclones.
Rates of relative sea-level rise at Galveston, which includes
both the land subsidence and sea-level component, averaged 6.5 mm per year between 1948 and 1986 (Paine 1993).
This rate is significant over the hundreds or thousands of
years elapsed since site occupation but has had only a minor effect over the years or decades since the project sites
were recorded. The estimated I 00-year flood elevation in the
project area is 12 ft (Federal Emergency Management Agency
1985), limiting flood-related erosion and deposition to the
valley floors and lower parts of the Pleistocene bluffs adjacent to Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River. Storm surge
and river flooding during the most severe recent events
raised water levels on Buffalo Bayou to 14.5 ft during Hurricane Carla (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 1961) and 10.1 ft
on San Jacinto Bay during Hurricane Alicia (U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers 1983). These heights, recorded during a strong

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

hurricane that made landfall at Matagorda Bay and a moderate hurricane that made landfall at Galveston Island, are probably not the highest elevations reached by storm tides in the
project area but illustrate the impact storms can have on
archeological sites located several feet above sea level.
Geological Effects of Human Activities
The project area, extending from the lower reaches of
Buffalo Bayou through Burnet, Scott, Tabbs, and San Jacinto
Bays to Morgans Point, has been severely impacted by human activities. These activities, including dredging of ship
channels, disposing of dredged material, producing hydrocarbons, extracting groundwater, and constructing industrial facilities, can make locating archeological sites and determining their geological context a challenge. Sites could
have been removed by dredging, covered by dredge disposal, eroded by wind- or ship-generated waves, and submerged by subsidence related to the production of groundwater and hydrocarbons.
Human-induced subsidence is particularly severe in the
project area, where it exacerbates submergence caused by
natural compactional subsidence and sea-level rise superimposed on generally low elevations. Local subsidence was
first noted by Pratt and Johnson (1926), who documented
more than 3 ft of subsidence in the Tabbs Bay area between
1917 and 1925 related to production of oil, water, and gas
from the Goose Creek Oil Field. Long-term monitoring of
benchmarks in the Galveston-Houston area has shown that
the land surface subsided 6 to 7 ft near Morgans Point and 8
to 9 ft in lower Buffalo Bayou between 1906 and 1987
(Gabrysch and Coplin 1990). Except at Tabbs Bay, most of
this subsidence has occurred since 1943. There was only 0.2
to 0.4 ft of elevation loss at Morgans Point and 0.6 to 0.8 ft in
lower Buffalo Bayou between 1906 and 1943 (Gabrysch and
Bonnet 1975). Elevation loss in the project area has been
largely attributed to water-level declines in the Chicot and
Evangeline aquifers in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s (Gabrysch
1969; Gabrysch and Coplin 1990). As surface-water supplies
supplanted groundwater for municipal and industrial uses
in the 1970s and 1980s, rates of elevation loss in the project
area slowed. Between 1978 and 1987, elevation loss in the
project area was about 0.25 ft (Gabrysch and Coplin 1990).
Sites reported before the 1960s at elevations within a few
feet of sea level are likely to have been submerged during
the period of rapid subsidence that began in the 1950s and
slowed in the 1970s.

Saltzman projector. The projected image was adjusted to
match the position and scale of the base map. Universal
Transverse Mercator coordinates were transferred from the
topographic base to the aerial photographs, which were then
scanned to produce a raster image of shoreline position for
a given date. These raster images were then traced to produce vector images of shoreline position. Each image of a
given geographic area was then translated and rotated to
common geographic coordinates to produce a time series of
shorelines for that site. A recent aerial photographic image

Topographic maps represent the earliest depiction of
shoreline position in the Galveston Bay area. Topographic
charts produced in the mid-1800s by the U.S. Coast Survey
(see Table 1) are the oldest maps that are reliable enough to
use, but coverage only extends a short distance upstream
from Galveston Bay (including sites 41HR680, 41HR68 l, and
41HR685). For the upstream sites, the earliest reliable maps
available are detailed topographic maps ( 1-ft elevation contour intervals) published in 1919 and 1920 by the USGS.
Aerial photographs are available for all sites beginning in
1930. Only black-and-white photographs were taken before
the 1970s; since that time, both black-and-white and colorinfrared images are available.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

INTRODUCTION

Pleistocene bedrock consists of an older unit inland (the
Lissie Formation) and a younger unit closer to the coast (the
Beaumont Formation). Holocene units are not named. This
broad coastal plain lies in a 60- to 160-km-wide band parallel
to the coast. Deposits are progressively older and more consolidated from the coast inland. All of the bedrock is elastic
and mostly is made up of clay, mud, silt, and sand with smallsized gravel in channel facies of the larger streams. Ancient
distributary systems are recognizable today as strips ofrelatively sandy to silty soils and substrate trending very generally from inland toward the coast (as for example, on both
sides of the San Jacinto River above its confluence with
Buffalo Bayou and in a band stretching between Deer Park
and La Porte in the immediate project area). Between these
are interfluvial flood basins predominantly of clay and mud
substrate and tight soils. Silts and clays are removed by
wave action on shorelines, leaving sandy beaches. Ancient,
sandy beaches and dunes are left behind as ridges by shore
pro gradation or marine regression (none of these is mapped
in the immediate project area).
When sea level was at or near its current level during
the last interglacial, deposition of sand, silt, and mud in fluvial, deltaic, and marine environments constructed the upper part of the Beaumont Formation. The top of the Beaumont is a Late Pleistocene surface that ceased aggrading at
the time the sea regressed at the beginining of the last glaciation. During the long period of lowered sea level when
streams cut deep valleys across the region, the Beaumont
surface was a stable to eroding upland on which deep soils
developed and matured. With the subsequent postglacial
rise in sea level, beginning about 18,000 years ago and continuing through the time of earliest human occupations
10,000-11,000 years ago, the river valleys were drowned,
slowly widened by stream migration and wave action, and
partially infilled with sediment. The ancient Beaumont surface outside of the valleys remained above sea level and
became a principal landform for human habitation, especially

This project lies along the Houston Ship Channel in
southeastern Harris County, Texas. For convenience, the
general project area is described as a corridor extending out
roughly 5 km from both sides of the ship channel from
Galveston Bay inland to a point 2.5 km up Buffalo Bayou
from its confluence with the San Jacinto River. Primary elements in the archeologically relevant physical setting of this
corridor are the topography, underlying geologic deposits,
a complex hydrology, and soils. Historically, the role of
weather and climate in shaping the physical and biological
character of the region is well known, but few data exist on
paleoclimate. Biotically, terrestrial flora and fauna as well as
aquatic fauna are significant. These dynamic elements combine to produce an intricate and ever-changing mosaic of
microenvironments, most of which have been extensively
modified by urban, industrial, and navigational development
over the last 150 years. Any understanding of prehistoric
human ecology in this setting depends on reconstructions
of environmental conditions as they existed prior to modem
impacts.

PHYSICALSETI'ING
The following general account of the physiography of
the Upper Texas Coast is drawn from several sources, including Aten ( 1983a), Fisher et al. (1972), Gagliano (1977),
McGowen et al. (1977), Paine (1990, 1991 ), and Paine and
Morton ( 1986), as well as Chapter 2 (this volume). It complements Chapter 2 in that it is more archeologically oriented in
terms of assessing the effects of past geological processes
and human activities on archeological sites, soils, and biotic
habitats.
Southeastern Texas is part of an extensive, low-relief
constructional landscape formed on coalesced fluviodeltaic
deposits of Quaternary age as part of the Gulf Coastal Plain.

next to the bays, bayous, and streams. This upland surface
has generally aggraded only a few tens of centimeters over
the last 12,000 years, meaning that the entire archeological
record in many places is found in deposits less than a meter
thick.
Principal relief (on the order of 10 min the project area)
is along valley margins of the numerous streams, bayous,
and headward cutting gullies that either drain or cross the
coastal plain. Salt domes (as at Barbers Hill in Chambers
County) produced local areas of higher elevation (up to 30 m
or more). Coastal dunes also afford local relief (typically less
than 5 m), but these are mostly restricted to open Gulf of
Mexico shores. The present project is in a subarea of the
Gulf Coastal Plain commonly designated informally as the
upper Gulf Coast of Texas (also, Upper Texas Coast, upper
coast, or upper coastal plain).
Hydrologically the upper coast is complex and dynamic.
The proximity of various and shifting fresh, brackish, and
saline aquatic environments supports closely spaced and
diverse habitats. The resultant biodiversity and its evolution have been fundamental in defining the nature and history of human use of the region.
Five major streams originate north of the upper coastal
plain and cross it in route to the gulf; these are the Sabine,
Neches, Trinity, Brazos, and Colorado Rivers. This project is
concerned with that portion of the upper coast between the
Trinity and Brazos Rivers. The general area is poorly drained
by several small streams that flow directly to the gulf and by
creeks, bayous, and the main stream comprising the San
Jacinto River basin. The Houston Ship Channel is an artificially deepened and straightened waterway along Buffalo
Bayou, the lower San Jacinto River, and Galveston Bay which
connects Houston's inland port and the Gulf of Mexico.
Numerous small bays and lagoons, as well as salt, brackish,
and freshwater marshes typify the lower reaches of large
drainages crossing the near-coast plain.
The constructional features of the natural landscape
were formed during interglacial and postglacial intervals of
marine high stands or still stands (see Chapter 2 this volume). The present shoreline systems have changed relatively little in the past 3,100 or so years during which time
sea level has not changed significantly (Paine 1991). During
the contrasting conditions of the last glacial interval, sea
level was lowered by as much as 100 m and streams cut deep
valleys across what is now the upper coastal plain and portions of the continental shelf. Lower reaches of these formerly subaerial valleys are now submerged in the gulf, and
more inland reaches form the bays and alluvial valleys of the
present coastal plain.
To these natural processes have been added two major
artificial impacts to the physical landscape, dredging and
extraction of oil, gas, and groundwater. That both of these
human impacts have extensively altered the Houston Ship
Channel corridor is seen dramatically on a 1975 map where
both sides of the channel from just below the San Jacinto

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

River and Buffalo Bayou confluence are bordered by extensive piles of redeposited dredged sediment (St. Clair et al.
1975:Sheet 4). Since this impact has occurred where early
human populations found and exploited the greatest diversity and concentration of biotic resources, the loss of archeological sites has been almost total.
Dredging of channels, ports, and the intracoastal waterway has significantly altered the coastline in and around
Galveston Bay. Along the Houston Ship Channel, sinuous
stretches of Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River have
been straightened and deepened. Large areas of dredged
material have accumulated along the channel margins either
on land or in the water. Madeland islands and peninsulas
have resulted from the dumping of dredged sediment on the
bay floor. Locally, deposition of dredge material has been so
extensive that it has kept pace with or even surpassed land
loss due to subsidence and erosion.
Numerous oil, gas, and water wells drilled in and around
Galveston Bay during this century have produced large volumes of these geofluids. Fluid extraction has resulted in
subsidence and minor tectonic activity in the corridor along
the ship channel. More significant than merely vertical measures of subsidence is the extent to which shorelines have
retreated across the low-relief terrain. Retreat distances
greater than 400 m have been recorded around the Goose
Creek Oil Field in Tabbs Bay (Paine and Morton 1986). Stream
valley and bay margins are subject to erosion by the forces
of stream flow, wave action, and slope wash. Progressive
loss of these landforms has undoubtedly resulted in loss of
archeological sites, particularly from earlier times (Paine 1987).
Minor surface faults are also mapped for the area (Kreitler
1976). These mostly relate to old faults reactivated by artificially induced subsidence as well as to natural salt dome
growth but probably had little effect on the archeological
record.
The natural landscape in and near the project area supports clayey and loamy prairie soils that are.generally poorly
drained (Wheeler 1976). Along the valley margins are clayey
to loamy soils with forest cover that are also poorly drained.
Somewhat more silty to sandy soils are found in the ancient
distributary channels, especially inland from the present
study area. Lowland soils in the major drainages-Buffalo
Bayou and San Jacinto River-are mainly poorly developed
and clayey. Marsh and floodplain deposits are subject to
periodic inundation and are potentially the setting for
cumulic soil development.

Climate and weather patterns in central and east Texas
generally, and on the Upper Texas Coast in particular, result
from the interplay of complex meteorological processes
(Bomer 1995a:217-226). Presently, climate in the Galveston
Bay area is warm and temperate with a mean, free-air annual
temperature of ca. 21Â° C, January mean daily highs of be-

Chapter 3: Environmental Setting

tweenca.15.5Â°Cand l7Â°C(Bomar 1995b:Figure4) and January low means of ca. 5.5Â° C to 8.5Â° C. July mean daily minimum temperatures range between 23.5Â° C and ca. 26Â° C while
July daily mean maximum range from about 31Â° C to 34Â° C
within Galveston Bay but only 32.5Â° C or more within the
current project area (Bomar 1995b:Figures 5 and 6; Fisher et
al. 1972: 17). Generally fewer than seven days with freezing
temperatures occur per year. In December and January, temperatures can fall to as low as ca. -12Â° C (Bomar 1995b:87).
Diurnal temperatures in the spring and autumn can vary
dramatically (Bomar 1995b:83).
Total rainfall averages ca. 122 to 132 cm per year in
Galveston Bay (Bomar 1995b:77), an excess of some 13 to 20
cm over evaporation and transpiration (Fisher et al. 1972: 17).
The average in Houston is 129.1 cm (Bomar 1995a:230).
Marked seasonal differences in precipitation are common
with the bulk typically coming between May and September
(Bomar 1995a:230). However, southeast Texas is prone to
excessive rainfall (Bomar 1995b:78), particularly associated
with tropical weather disturbances. Droughts are less common but have still affected some portion of southeast Texas
every decade this century (Bomar 1995b:79-80). Local rainfall as well as runoff from inland drainages is a critical factor
in the salinity balance between fresh to brackish and brackish to saline waters in estuaries and bays. Periods of lowered freshwater inflow result in increased salinity whereas
increased freshwater flow decreases salinity in bays and
estuaries. This balance is particularly precarious during hurricanes where high surges of seawater are countered by
abundant freshwater runoff from heavy rains (Fisher et al.
1972:21).
The Upper Texas Coast is highly susceptible to hurricanes and strong tropical weather disturbances, especially
in the late summer and early fall. In any given year there is
about a 1 in 8 (or ca. 12 percent) chance of a tropical storm
striking the area around Galveston Bay (Bomar 1995a). These
relatively frequent storms typically strike the coast from the
southeast and greatly accelerate processes of erosion and
deposition not only through tidal storm surge and increased
rainfall but also by unique, powerful currents generated by
strong counter-clockwise winds (Fisher et al. 1972:21). A
general model of the sequential effects of a hurricane, from
approach through landfall, is presented by McGowen et al.
(1977). Data on severe storms and floods recorded historically have been compiled by Bomar (1995a) and Paine and
Morton(1986).
Wind is an important climatic factor not only for its
influence on temperature and rainfall (e.g., Bomar 1995b:8789; Fisher et al. 1972:17-21) but for its effect on bothlongshore
currents in the open gulf as well as the generation of unique
wave patterns and circulation in Galveston Bay (McGowen
et al. 1977). Sea breeze ameliorates temperatures and gulf
moisture contributes to rainfall stimulated by tropical storms,
convection storms, and frontal passage. Shoreline currents
and circulation in the bays directly influence the substrate,

11

turbidity, and other environmental variables important to
fish and shellfish. Dominant wind flow is from the southeast
although strong north-northwesterly flows associated with
"northers" are common in the winter months and can produce intense wave activity (Fisher et al. 1972; Hoyt et al.
1998: 15). Wind speed averages 6.8 knots (ca. 12.5 km/hr) but
varies greatly (Fisher et al. 1972). Wind regimes also affect
geomorphological processes through aeolian transport and
deposition.
In the immediate project area (and for a minimum of 25
km upstream on Buffalo Bayou and the San Jacinto River) all
of the streams, bays, and estuaries are within normal tide
reach. Astronomical tidal ranges along the bay shoreline
have been measured at between 0.5 and 1.4 ft (0.2 to 0.4 m)
(Diener 1975). Lakes, ponds, and marshes are at or very close
to sea level. This means that salinity is completely under the
control of the balance between the seaward flow of freshwater and the landward encroachment of saltwater.
Paleoclimate in the Upper Texas Coast is not well known.
Paleoenvironmental reconstructions can only be done in a
general fashion and have been largely limited to inferences
based on geomorphological analysis (e.g., Aten 1983a: 131139; Paine 1987, 1990) and the physiological tolerances of
marine fauna recovered in archeological contexts (e.g., Gadus and Howard 1990:19-21). This is mainly due to both
poor preservation conditions as well as the relatively recent
(ca. 3500 B.P.) stabilization of the coastline at or near its
presentlevel(Gagliano 1977;Paine 1991;Ricklis 1993). The
climatic shift from glacial to postglacial times with the concomitant rise in sea level, is the major event inferred for the
region. There is little evidence for significant changes in
floral or faunal communities in the Holocene in southeast
Texas (Patterson 1995:240). Data compiled by Collins
(1995:Table 2) from 12 geological, palynological, or paleontological records in or near adjacent central Texas reflect a
consistent, if generalized, pattern. A mesic interval that began ca. 11,000 B.P. was followed in the Middle Holocene by a
roughly 5,000-year-long xeric interval, ending ca. 2500-3000
B.P. with a shift to more mesic conditions. Finally, data from
Hall's Cave (Toomey 1993) suggest a final shift to drier conditions during the latest Holocene. Both Story (1990:244)
and Nordt et al. (1994) have also inferred a shift to moister,
cooler weather in east-central and central Texas following
the Middle Holocene followed by a shift to somewhat drier
conditions at ca. 2000 B.P. Although these data cannot be
uncritically extended to the Upper Texas Coast (e.g., Bryant
and Shafer 1977), in the absence of direct evidence from
nearer the project area they should at least be considered.
Nevertheless, the magnitude of climatic fluctuations in
the Holocene (Postglacial) epoch has been of less importance to human ecology than have adjustments to continued sea level change, the development of barrier islands and
peninsulas, and modification of bay and estuary substrate
by the introduction of fluvial sediment. For example, markedly increased quantities offish remains in Nueces Bay sites

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

12

(farther south) after ca. 2000 B.P. are inferred to reflect dramatic increases in estuarine productivity related to the development of the modern barrier island (Ricklis 1993). On the
Upper Texas Coast too, the main climatic effect on human
history must have been the control that rainfall (along with
the restriction of tidal salinization) has had over the salinity
of estuaries and bays and, therefore, fish and shellfish resources. While these controls are delicate, subtle weather
pattern shifts of mere years or decades in duration are too
minor for present-day paleoclimatology to detect; they could,
nonetheless, have had significant effects on aquatic habitats and, consequently, on humans.

BIOTA
Most of the uplands in and near the project area are
prairies fringed by wooded valley margins and lowlands.
These forests in turn yield to freshwater to brackish marshes
along the edges of water courses and major drainages. Brackish marshes currently comprise ca. 65 to 70 percent of the
marsh system in the Galveston Bay area while only 5 to 10
percent is categorized as freshwater marsh. The remaining
25 to 30percentis saltwater marsh (White and Paine 1992:13).
Tidally influenced, protected estuaries are among the most
biotically productive microenvironments on earth (e.g., Odum
1971) and are capable of supporting enormous populations
of fish, shellfish, birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians
and, by extension, human populations. The proximity of
marshes, woodlands, and prairies afforded hunter-gatherers
ready access to a variety of plants as well as native and
migratory animals. Compared to the rest of Texas, terrestrial
mammalian biodiversity, measured as number of mammalian
species per sample quadrat, is moderately high. Locally, this
number is around 48 species per quadrat which is about
average for the state as a whole, low compared to the basin
and range province where about 60 to 70 species reside per
quadrat, and high compared to the blackland prairie or sandy
south Texas plains quadrats each with around 42 resident
species (Davis and Schmidly 1994:2-4).
Two typical terrestrial habitats prevail in and near the
project area. These are upland prairies and woodlands along
valley margins. Grasses growing on the prairies include
bluestem (Schizachyrium spp. and Andropogon spp.),
switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), eastern gamagrass
(Tripsacum dactyloides), Paspalum spp., and indiangrasses
(Sorghastrum spp.) interspersed with forbs and some mesquite (Prosopis spp.), hackberry (Ce/tis spp.), huisache (Acacia farnesiana), and other trees (Fisher et al. 1972; Gould
1975; White and Paine 1992). The prairie habitat was in the
past suitable for bison, and its remnants today are foraged
by deer (Odocoileus virginianus). As late as 1841, a small
herd of buffalo was reported around part of Galveston Bay
(Ashbel Smith 1841:384). Other mammals occupying the prairie and margins are smaller, including rabbits (mainly
Sylvilagus floridanus), packrats (Neotoma sp.), cotton rats

(Sigmodon sp.), and numerous other rodents (Davis and
Schmidly 1994) as well as bobwhite quail (Colinus
virginianus) and prairie chickens (Tympanuchus cupido)
(Robbins et al. 1983; see also Ashbel Smith 1841:384).
Ferdinand Roemer (1935:57), a German visitor to the area in
January, 1846, described his first view of a Texas prairie as
" ... an unbroken, level, grassy plain extended for miles before us, on which a few islands of trees and shrubs were
scattered in irregular order." He also went on to note how
wet the prairie was and that "the only living thing we saw on
this broad expanse were Canadian geese [probably Branta
canadensis] ... a chattering flock of which were grazing in
the wet grass" (Roemer 1935:57). Extensive industrial development as well as the communities of La Porte, Morgans
Point, Deer Park, and Baytown now occupy much of the
former prairie in the project area.
Fluvial woodlands prevail along stream valleys (e.g.,
Buffalo, Santa Anna, and Tucker Bayous and the San Jacinto
River) and in certain areas too poorly drained for prairie
species. Typical tree species include elm ( Ulmus spp. ), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), ash (Fraxinus spp.), sweetgum
(Liquidamber styraciflua), bois d'arc (Madura pomifera),
loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), shortleafpine (Pinus echinata),
Magnolia spp., blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), live
oak (Q. virginica), water oak (Q. nigra), pecan (Carya
illinoensis), and hickory (Carya spp.). Understory vegetation includes woody species such as greenbrier (Smilax spp.),
yaupon (flex vomitoria), wild grapes (Vitis spp.) as well as
carpetgrass (Axonopus spp.), bermuda grass (Cynodon
dactylon), and other grasses and forbs. Common mammals
of the forested valley margins and adjacent prairie margin
are white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus), eastern cotton tail (Sylvilagus floridanus), jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis),
and fox squirrel (S. niger). Carnivores include opossum (Didelphis virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), gray fox
(Urocyon cinereoargenteus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote
(Canis latrans), and both the eastern spotted skunk
(Spilogale putorius) and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Other inhabitants of the fluvial woodland are numerous
reptiles, amphibians, and birds (Garrett and Barker 1987;
Robbins et al. 1983). In the past, these woods and prairies
supported black bear (Ursus americanus), cougar (Fe/is
concolor), red wolf (Canis rufus), gray wolf (Canis lupus),
and other species that are today either extirpated or rare
including bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), peregrine
falcon (Falco peregrinus), and wild turkey (Meleagris
gallopavo) (Davis 1978; Davis and Schmidly 1994; Robbins
et al. 1983). In 1846, Col. James Morgan reported that bear
were "still plentiful" in the forests around Morgans Point
(Roemer 1935:56).
Aquatic and wetland habitats along the Buffalo Bayou/
San Jacinto River estuary inland of Galveston Bay are numerous and variable but can be placed into two general
groups-water bodies and wetlands (Fisher et al. 1972; St.

Chapter 3: Environmental Setting

Clair et al. 1975:Sheet 4). Water bodies today include severely altered natural bays and lakes as well as artificial ponds
and harbors. The most extensive wetland habitats in
Galveston Bay are fresh-brackish marshes (White and Paine
1992:13). Subsidence, contamination, and dredging have had
pronounced effects on both natural water bodies and estuarial marshes. Nevertheless, despite the fact that approximately half of the nation's chemical production and a third
of its petroleum industry are located in the area, Galveston
Bay remains a major commercial fishery, producing large
numbers of finfish, shrimp, crab, and oysters (Loeffler and
Walton 1992: 10). Even before these modem impacts, the biota
in lakes and bays responded dynamically to sea level change
and fluctuations in salinity, as well as the rate of sedimentation and composition of the sediments. Mobile animals such
as fish, crabs, and shrimp can respond rapidly to changing
habitat conditions. On the other hand, in order to maintain
high population densities, relatively immobile species like
molluscs must be adapted to handle changes in salinity by
osmoregulation. Common Rangia (Rangia cuneata) in particular, while preferring salinity between 1 %0 (ppt) and 15
%0, has a remarkable tolerance range and therefore thrives in
the Upper Galveston Bay. However, they are only able to
spawn and pioneer new beds within a narrow salinity range
(Hopkins et al. 1973: 136-149). Once established (sometimes
far from their parent source) these pioneering Rangia populations can thereafter survive under a very wide range of
environmental conditions (Hopkins et al. 1973). Because they
may spawn only infrequently, Rangia beds are often composed of only restricted age and size classes. The age and
size of individual clams may also be affected by the number
and fr~quency of salinity fluctuations (Harrell et al. 1998).
Shallow, accessible Rangia Clam beds can reach densities of
several hundred individuals per square meter (Hopkins et al.
1973 :4). The abundance of this euryhaline food resource no
doubt accounts for the estimate that at least 90 percent of
the archeological shell middens on the Upper Texas Coast
are composed almost exclusively of Rangia cuneata (Aten
1983a:329). However, the importance of the common Rangia
as a food resource should not be overestimated (Dering and
Ayers 1977 :59) as the diet of prehistoric peoples must have
been supplemented by a wide range of other foods, including terrestrial fauna (especially deer), fish, and turtles, among
others (e.g., Patterson 1995:Table 2).
In addition to Rangia cuneata, the estuary supports
populations of Macoma spp., dwarf surf clam (Mulinia
lateris), Vioscalba louisanae (syn. Probythenella
louisianae), olive nerite (Neritina [Vitta]reclivata), and
where salinity is higher, brown Rangia (Rangia flexuosa)
and oyster (Crassostrea virginica) (Andrews 1981; Gadus
and Howard 1990:9; Hopkins et al. 1973:30-33). While far
outnumbered by Rangia (R. cuneata) sites, a number of
oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and brown Rangia (R.
flexuosa) shell middens have been found where salinity is
somewhat higher. There is, however, little evidence for ex-

13

ploitation of a wider range of moderate-to-high salinity molluscan species in the Galveston Bay area, as is the case
farther down the Texas coast where freshwater influx is much
lower (Ricklis 1994: 10-11 ).
Bay margin and estuarial water bodies are also rich in
other marine life, although the particular mix of species and
their locations shifted seasonally and over longer intervals .
of time. Among the economically important fish are sand
trout (Cyoscion arenarius and C. nothus), spotted sea trout
or weakfish (Cynoscion nebulosus), striped mullet (Mugil
cephalus), southern flounder (Paralichtys lethostigma),
shortnose gar (Lepisosteus platostomus), channel catfish
(lchtalurus punstatus), freshwater drum (Aplodinotus
grunniens), redfish (Sciaenops ocellata), black drum
(Pogonias cromis), Atlantic croaker (Micropogon
undulatus), whiting (Menticirrhus spp.) sheepshead
(Archosargus probatocephalus), bluegill (Lepomis
macrochirus), and other sunfishes (Lepomis spp.) (Hoese
and Moore 1977; Pew et al. 1958). Although conventional
screening methods underestimate the number of small, fragile fish bones, Ricklis (1994: 11) states that "fish bones have
been abundantly documented at archaeological sites in the
area" and that "fish were clearly a major staple for aboriginal
populations." Farther upstream in the major drainages, freshwater fish include largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides),
shiners (Notropis spp. ), and many others (cf. Ricklis 1994: 13 ).
In addition, fresh-brackish estuaries are important "nurseries" or seasonal habitats for shellfish that are themselves
potential human food resources or are prey species for larger
economically useful animals. These include blue crab
(Callinectes sapidus), white shrimp (Penaeus setiferus), and
brown shrimp (P. aztecus) (Leary 1964; Moffett 1967; Osborn
et al. 1992). Healthy, extensive estuaries and submerged
grasslands are vitally important for the maintanence of fish
and shellfish populations (Loeffler and Walton 1992).
Around the margins of the bays and lakes are brackish
water marshes, ranging in salinity from almost fresh to moderately saline. These shallow-water habitats support
marshhay cordgrass (Spartina patens), Gulf cordgrass
(Spartina spartinae), seashore saltgrass (Distichlis spicata),
and other grasses; reeds (Phragmites spp.); giant millet (Setaria magna); seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum);
alligatorweed (Altemanthera philoxeroides); Olney bulrush
(Scirpus olneyi), California (S. californicus) and saltmarsh
(S. maritimus) bulrushes, cattail (Typha latifolia and T.
domingensis), and other rushes (Juncus spp.) and bulrushes
(Scirpus spp.) (Fisher et al. 1972:Table 6; White and Paine
1992). The vegetation of frequently flooded fluvial areas
often includes willow (Salix spp.) as well as rushes and
cattail (Fisher et al. 1972:Table 6).
The abundance and variety of plants, fish, shellfish,
molluscs, and other small animals inhabiting the shallow
bays and estuarine marshes of Galveston Bay are particularly attractive to resident and migratory (seasonal or transitory) waterfowl. Ferdinand Roemer (1935:55-56) described

14

San Jacinto Bay in January 1846:
From the house [Col. James Morgan's on Morgans Point]
one had a good view of the bay which was about two miles
wide. Countless flocks of waterbirds, which I had never seen
before, inhabited it. In many places the surface of the water
was completely blackened by myriads of wild ducks. Whole
rows of white swans, resembling silver bands from the distance, clumsy pelicans, geese and various diving birds without number completed the swarms of the feathered denizens. A confused noise, composed of the thousand-fold
cackling and screeching rose up from the water as if corning
from a huge poultry yard, and this continued unabated
throughout the night.
In a history of Harris County from 1839 to 1845, Fletcher
(1950:25) adds that "inlets of Galveston Bay were filled with
wild ducks, brant, and geese by the end of October (and)
Col. James Morgan reported that one of his slaves killed
sixty-five ducks in about two hours." In addition to innumerable resident and migratory perching birds
(Passeriformes), owls, gulls, swifts, hawks, falcons, and the
like found on the Upper Texas Coast (e.g., Robbins et al.
1983), some of the more potentially important economic resources to past residents of Galveston Bay include a large
number of waterfowl and shorebirds. These include surface
feeding ducks such as mallard (Anas platyrhynclws), American black duck (Anas rubripes), mottled duck (Anas
fulvigula), northern pintail (Anas acuta), American wigeon
(Anas americana), and teals (Anas spp.); bay ducks such as
redhead (Aythya americana), canvasback (Aythya
valisineria), various scaup (Aythya spp.), and ring-necked
duck (Aythya collaris); sea ducks like bufflehead (Bucephala
albeola) and common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula);
mergansers (Mergus spp.); swans (Cygnus spp.); cormorants (Phalacrocorax spp.); pelicans (Phaethon spp); and
herons and egrets (Ardea spp. and Egretta spp.) (Robbins
et al. 1983; Slack et al. 1992). In all, 32 species of waterfowl

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

(Sheridan et al. 1988, cited in Slack et al. 1992) and 35 species
of shorebirds (Slack et al. 1992:268) have been reported for
the Galveston Bay estuary system.
Euryhaline marshes and bay margins are also favorable
habitats for snapping turtle ( Chelydra serpentina
serpentina), eastern box turtle (Terrapene carollina), diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna), and mud turtle (Kinostemon spp.)
as well as muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus) (Behler and King 1979; Davis and
Schrnidly 1994; Garrett and Barker 1987). The American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) also occupies the marsh.
In addition to inhabitant species, a wide variety of reptiles,
amphibians, and carnivores are also attracted to the perimeter of the marshes. Riverine areas upstream support river
otter (Lutra canadensis) and beaver (Castor canadensis)
(Davis and Schrnidly 1994).
In aggregate the mosaic of these varied habitats afforded prehistoric (and historic) peoples a diverse array of
resources that could be exploited throughout the year. Based
on early ethnohistoric accounts (e.g., Aten 1983a; Ricklis
1994:24-43, 1996), it appears that aboriginal populations lived
only part of the year in the immediate coastal zone and spent
the remaining time in the interior where additional resources,
such as bison, nuts, and prickly pear cactus were available
(cf. Hall 1998). Aten (1983a:20) has stated that over 125 animal taxa have been recovered archeologically as food remains on the Upper Texas Coast. While some may challenge
that particular number, it is clear that despite the ubiquity
and prominence of Rangia shell midden sites in the archeological record, the prehistoric human inhabitants of Galveston
Bay had access to a wide range of potential food and economic resources and in all likelihood took advantage of it,
whether or not it is possible to conclusively demonstrate
each one individually.

CHAPTER4

CULTURAL BACKGROUND

IN1RODUCITON

OVERVIEWOFTHEPREIIlSTORYOFTHEUPPER
TEXAS COAST

The primary objective ofthis chapter is to provide temporal and cultural background necessary to assess the age
and significance of sites investigated during this study. A
synopsis of what is known of the prehistory and history of
the Galveston Bay area is presented. Since all nine of the
previously recorded prehistoric sites to be evaluated are
ceramic-bearing and there are no clear indications of earlier
archeological components at any of them, this discussion is
weighted toward the recent end of the local archeological
record. Several recent syntheses are available that cover the
prehistoric and historic occupations in the project area and
Southeastern Texas in general (Aten 1983a; Freeman 1990;
Patterson 1995, 1996; Story 1985, 1990). Following the outline of the prehistoric cultural chronology is a brief discussion of ethnohistoric accounts from the Protohistoric and
Early Historic periods and the broad trends in Native-European relations prevailing at that time. Inferences and information about aboriginal cultures derived from these
ethnohistorical records are summarized and reviewed, drawn
almost entirely from the more detailed and comprehensive
discussions in Aten (1979, 1983a) and Ricklis (1990, 1994,
1996). The following chapter presents a more detailed discussion of specific archeological projects, findings, and significant research issues in and around the project area.
For most of southeastern Texas in general and especially for the immediate estuarial environment, the archeological record indicates that throughout prehistory, human
adaptations remained dependent upon hunting, gathering,
fishing, and shellfishing without any significant move toward food production: In this sense, as in much of the rest of
the state, the prehistory of southeastern Texas is a laboratory for the study of long-term hunter-gatherer adaptations
that continued well after nearby peoples had begun to grow
crops.

Aten has partitioned the prehistory of the Upper Texas
Coast into three broad time periods: the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric-Woodland (Aten 1983a: 141-142).
The first two periods predate the first appearance of pottery
in the Galveston Bay area and are dealt with separately. The
final, Late Prehistoric period begins with the introduction of
native ceramics about 2,000 years ago and continues into
the Protohistoric and Historic periods. It is the most abundantly represented and best understood prehistoric time
period and is therefore discussed in considerably greater
detail than are the earlier, preceramic periods.
Preceramic Period

The earliest well-established human occupations of North
America are referred to as the Paleoindian, generally dated
from about 12,000 B.P. to ca. 9000 B.P. (Aten 1983a). Story
( 1990: 178-210) has summarized distributional and contextual
data on Paleoindian archeological remains in southeastern
Texas which she labels collectively the Early Cultures.
Paleoindian artifacts are generally abundant on the Upper
Texas Coast and in southeastern Texas but are almost exclusively from disturbed or secondary contexts, except well inland of the modem coastline. They are therefore recognized
and dated primarily by reference to more securely dated, intact sites in adjacent regions. Paleoindian components are
recognized principally by distinctive, carefully crafted lanceolate projectile points. These include Clovis and Folsom
fluted points as well as other, unfluted types such as
Scottsbluff, Plainview, Angostura, and Dalton. Paleoindian
lithic assemblages are also typically characterized by extralocal
(or even extraregional) raw material and specialized tool types
such as unifacial scrapers and gravers.

15

16

During the Paleoindian period, continental glaciers held
much of the world's available water supply and sea level
was as much as 40 m lower than it is today. As a consequence, the Upper Texas Coast Gulf shoreline was between
30 and 40 km east and southward of its present position
(Gagliano 1977; Paine and Morton 1986). The most likely
areas for finding Paleoindian sites (e.g., coastal and riverine
settings where food resources might be concentrated) are
now well offshore or have since been deeply buried and
inundated by rising Holocene sea levels. Abundant
Paleoindian remains have been recovered along Mcfaddin
Beach (Long 1977; Turner and Tanner 1994) but are clearly
redeposited from an actively eroding site just offshore. Submerged Early Holocene shell middens and other archeological sites may be a common feature along former
paleochannels now offshore (e.g., Pearson et al. 1986; Stright
1990).
The Paleoindian period is followed by the Archaic. Dates
for the end of the Paleoindian period vary, depending on
where one prefers to draw the line between Paleoindian and
subsequent Archaic period adaptations. Most researchers
place the beginning of the Archaic on the Upper Texas Coast
at about 9000 B.P. (Aten 1983a:l52-157; Story 1990). However, Patterson (e.g., 1995, 1996) and Prewitt (1981) propose
that what they identify as late Paleoindian point types persist until ca. 7000 B.P. Ricklis (1994: 14) places the end of the
Paleoindian somewhat earlier, at ca 8000 B.P. Story (1990:211)
notes that the term "Archaic" has been used in a number of
ways: as a developmental stage, as a way of life, and as a
period of time. For present purposes, we retain Aten's
(1983a:141) usage of the term "Archaic" on the Upper Texas
Coast: "primarily to categorize cultures spanning the period
of major post-Pleistocene environmental changes necessitating important shifts in adaptation."
Story (1990:213) notes that Archaic chronologies in
southeast Texas are "among the least well established in
North America." Nonetheless, a number of Archaic projectile point chronologies have been proposed (e.g., Ensor 1990;
Patterson 1995, 1996; Story 1990), againderivedforthemost
part by reference to more securely dated components in
adjacent regions. While a basic hunter-gatherer lifeway persisted from late Paleoindian to Archaic times, some changes
do appear to have occurred. An apparent diminution of group
territories may be reflected by greater utilization oflocal lithic
resources accompanied by a shift toward more "task-specific and expedient" stone tool assemblages (cf. Kelly and
Todd 1988:240). The Archaic period is generally considered
to have ended with the introduction of either the bow and
arrow or ceramics, although basic lifeways may have actually changed very little (e.g., Prewitt's [1981 :74] "Neo-Archaic"). The following discussion follows most closely the
Archaic cultural chronology outlined by Aten (1983a) and
Story (1990).
The Archaic may be divided into three periods: early,
middle, and late. The Early Archaic dates from roughly 7000

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

to ca. 3000 B.C. during the Middle Holocene (Aten
1983a: 143). At this time, the Gulf of Mexico shoreline remained up to IO km seaward of its present position (Aten
1983a: 117). Very few intact Early Archaic components are
known on the Upper Texas Coast (Aten 1983a:153; Story
1990:222-223). Story (1985:31-34) has suggested that this
low site density reflects limited human occupation of the
coastal plain during the Early Archaic, although its inner
margin may have been more intensively occupied (e.g., the
Doering [Wheat 1953] and 41WH19 [Patterson et al. 1987]
sites). Notched and stemmed projectile points, including Bell,
Carrollton, Morrill, Trinity, and Wells are associated with the
Early Archaic in southeast Texas and several of these types
persist into the following Middle Archaic period (Patterson
1995, 1996:16-17).
During the Middle Archaic from ca. 3000 to 1000 B.C.
(Aten 1983a:137), the Gulf shoreline appears to have stabilized near its current locations (Gagliano 1977; Paine and
Morton 1986). Nonetheless, while archeological site frequency apparently continued to increase inland, few sites
along the coast predate ca. 2000 B.C. (Story 1990:222). This
probably reflects the time needed for the maturation of the
barrier island system which in tum permitted the establishment and expansion of biotically rich estuaries capable of
supporting large human populations (Ricklis 1994; Story
1985). The first shell midden sites appear during the Middle
Archaic, such as the earliest components at the Harris
County Boys School site (41HR80/85), which date to about
1700 B.c. (Aten et al. 1976) and the lowest levels at the
Worthington site (41HR124) at Peggy Lake (Gadus and
Howard 1990). Middle Archaic projectile point types include
rectangular stemmed points resembling Bulverde and Travis
as well as Pedemales, Lange, Williams, and the Gary-Kent
series of straight and contracting stem points (Patterson
1996: 17-18; Patterson et al. 1987). Increased territoriality may
be indicated by the presence of Middle and Late Archaic
cemeteries, especially inland between the Brazos and Colorado River drainages (seeHall 1981; Patterson 1995:247; Story
1990:237-242). Aboriginal seasonal subsistence/settlement
patterns, akin to those recounted in later ethnohistorical
accounts, may have been established by the latter part of
the Middle Archaic (Aten 1983a; Aten et al. 1976).
Late Archaic (ca. 1000 B.C. to ca. A.D. 100) occupations
of southeast Texas are much better known, although discerning actual cultural changes from the Middle Archaic to
Late Archaic is uncertain (Aten 1983a: 157). However, there
does appear to have been an increasing differentiation between "eastern" and "southwestern" cultural adaptations
(Story 1985:54) on the coastal plain, wherein an eastern pattern suited to the humid woodlands and prairies of the Upper Texas Coast evolved in the direction of increasing territoriality, more limited mobility, and higher population densities, while southern adaptations (to the semiarid savannas
of the southwest coastal plain) reflected a more seasonal,
restricted resource base with lower population densities,
B.C.

Chapter 4: Cultural Background

larger territories, and higher mobility. The littoral zone falls
in between these extremes with shifting tendencies toward
one or the other of these adaptive postures at different times.
Most Late Archaic sites on the Upper Texas Coast postdate ca. 500 B.C., possibly representing significant population increase (Aten 1983a:157-159). Nevertheless, beginning
around 1000 B.C., subsistence/settlement adaptations increasingly focused on coastal zone resources under climatic conditions approximating those of the present and expanded
into nearly all habitats used during later periods (Aten
1983a:157-159; Story 1990:243). Numerous Late Archaic,
preceramic shell middens have been excavated in the
Galveston Bay area (e.g., Ambler 1970, 1973; Aten 1967,
1983a: 157-159; Dillehay 1975), and they typically contain
both Rangia spp. and oyster (Crassostrea virginica) shell,
the bones of mammals, fish, and reptiles, and varying
amounts of lithic debitage or tools (particularly Gary and
Kent dart points). Tools made of bone and shell (including
socketed bone projectile points, awls, and beads), and possibly ground stone, were also added to the native technological repertoire during the Late Archaic. In short, the content of these middens, both in terms of food refuse and
artifact inventory, is virtually identical to that recovered from
early Ceramic period middens, with the obvious exception of
pottery. Late Prehistoric subsistence/settlement patterns, in
terms of annual rounds and seasonal scheduling, were clearly
established by the Late Archaic. Some Late Archaic burials
contain exotic grave goods and/or exhibit evidence of violent death, possibly from inter-group conflict (Hall 1981:308;
Patterson 1995:247; Story 1990:240-241).
Ceramic Period: Late Prehistoric-Woodland
or Late Cultures
The end of the Archaic and the beginning of the Late
Prehistoric or Woodland period is conventionally marked in
the Galveston Bay area by the appearance of pottery roughly
2,000 years ago. This section provides a brief introduction
to Aten's (1979, 1983a) Ceramic period chronology for the
Galveston Bay area in order to provide a background to the
assessment of archeological collections and sites discussed
in subsequent chapters. Aten's ceramic subperiods are distinguished primarily on the basis of changing frequencies of
ceramic types as well as the presence or absence of other
artifact types such as arrow and bone projectile points. While
particular aspects of Aten's chronology may be criticized, it
nonetheless remains the most detailed, comprehensive, and
well-established chronological framework available for the
project area, particularly in the absence of other independent means of dating individual archeological components.
The development of Aten's ceramic seriation and cultural
chronology is reviewed prior to the summary presentation
of selected details for each defined subperiod.
The apparent relationships of Late Prehistoric cultures
on the Upper Texas Coast to other aboriginal groups in adj a-

17

cent areas are also presented, along with selected criticisms
and revisions of Aten's chronology that have been offered
since it first appeared 20 years ago (Aten 1979, 1983a).
Ethnohistoric accounts of native cultures on the Upper Texas
Coast are also reviewed as are brief summaries of both the
Protohistoric and Historic periods. Finally, Aten's developmental and operational model of prehistoric cultures on the
Upper Texas Coast, based on both ethnohistorical and archeological data, is presented. The following discussion
outlines the history and development of Aten's ceramic typology and Galveston Bay seriation chronology.
DEVELOPMENfOF ATEN'SUPPER TEXAS COAST
CERMDClYPOLOGY AND AREAL CHRONOLOGIES

Prior to the 1960s, relatively little was known about the
archeological record of the Upper Texas Coast, as reflected
in the somewhat speculative and indefinite chronological
and typological schema presented in early reports and summaries (e.g., Campbell 1957; Sayles 1935; Suhmetal. 1954;
Wheat 1953). Few archeological investigations were conducted by professional archeologists; most were undertaken
by avocationals, and the results remained for the most part
unpublished (Guy 1990; Chapter 7 this report). However, the
late 1960s and 1970s witnessed a dramatic increase in the
number of cultural resource management (CRM) and student projects in the Galveston Bay area (e.g., Ambler 1967;
Aten 1967; Aten et al. 1976; Dillehay 1975; Gilmore 1974;
O'Brien 1971; Shafer 1966, 1975, 1970, 1973; Tunnell and
Ambler 1967; see also comprehensive reviews in Guy 1990
and Stokes 1985). While the general sequence and morphology of native ceramic types was worked out during this
period, the wealth of new data (generated as a result of these
investigations) increasingly demonstrated the insufficiency
of existing chronologies and ceramic typologies. Attempts
to organize and make sense of this growing body of data
was undertaken in earnest first by Ambler (1970, 1973) and
later by Aten (1979, 1983a) as a doctoral dissertation research project.
Aten began by reviewing previously defined Upper
Texas Coast ceramic types and typologies. He concluded
that ambiguously defined or difficult to recognize types
hindered meaningful comparison between sites and individual components. Therefore, Aten advocated and developed a type-variety classification system for the Upper
Texas Coast modeled after one used in the Lower Mississippi Valley (Phillips 1970). The goal of Aten's revised typology was the definition of temporally significant and
reproducible ceramic "types" by eliminating those that were
ambiguous or difficult to reliably recognize, such as
Wallisville Plain (cf. Ambler 1970, 1973), while at the same
time retaining sufficient typological flexibility to identify
potentially significant within-type "varieties." Aten's types
were defined primarily on the basis of paste characteristics
(e.g., sandy vs. silty clay); the presence of aplastic inclu-

18

sions (such as grog [crushed sherds] or sand) used as
tempering agents; or decorative attributes and techniques
including incising, rocker-stamping, or a red film or wash
applied to the vessel surface. Few within-type "varieties"
were specified (except to distinguish paste differences
within the grog-tempered types). The lone exception among
the untempered ceramics is an Anahuac variety of the type
Goose Creek Plain, which is defined by unique betweentype characteristics that may reflect intermediate steps in
an evolutionary development from Lower Mississippi Valley ceramic types such as Tchefuncte and Mandeville to
local, indigenous Goose Creek wares (see below). While
infrequently employed in Aten's typology, the "variety"
concept was nevertheless retained to allow necessary typological flexibility.
An additional advantage of adopting Phillips's (1970)
type-variety classification was the clear similarities between
Lower Mississippi Valley and Upper Texas Coast pottery
during certain time periods (Aten 1983a:298). In fact, the
earliest ceramics in the Galveston Bay area are clearly derived from, or share a common origin with, the ceramics from
the Lower Mississippi Valley and coastal Louisiana (Aten
1983a:297). The initial appearance of ceramics occurred in a
time-transgressive pattern from east to west along the Texas
coast, first along the coastal margin and only later in inland
areas. Pottery appeared in the Sabine Lake area by at least 70
B.c.; in the Galveston Bay area by A.D. 100; farther southwest in the Brazos Delta-West Bay area by A.D. 300; and
finally inland in the Conroe-Livingston region by A.D. 500
(Aten 1983a:282-298). Lower Mississippi Valley ceramic types
persisted throughout the prehistoric sequence in the Sabine
Lake area, but were restricted to the earliest ceramic period
in the Galveston Bay area with the probable exception of
later grog-tempered wares about 1,000 years before present
(discussed below).
In recognition of Southeastern influences on Late Prehistoric cultures on the Upper Texas Coast, Aten (1983a,
1984) and Shafer (1975) used the term Woodland to refer to
the Ceramic period here, although both noted the virtual
absence of certain classic "Woodland" cultural traits such
as cord-marked pottery. Story (1990:256), on the other hand,
believes that the Late Prehistoric cultures of southeast Texas
(both inland and on the coast) are sufficiently distinctive to
warrant designation of a separate, regional "Mossy Grove"
cultural tradition; which she defines as "a general cultural
pattern and as a regional tradition'A[that] encompasses the
archeological remains of what were surely different ethnic
(and possibly even linguistic) groups" and expressed in part
by a "widespread indigenous southeastern Texas type,
Goose Creek Plain (variety unspecified)" [italics in original]
(Story 1990:246). Following Story, many researchers have
dropped the term "Woodland" altogether and refer to the
Late Prehistoric, Late Cultures, or simply the Ceramic period

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

(e.g., Gadus and Howard 1990; Patterson 1996; Weinstein
1991).
The Galveston Bay Ceramic Period Chronology
Using his newly redesigned ceramic typology, Aten reexamined new and existing collections from discrete (and in
some cases well dated) site components. He then organized
the available stratigraphic, chronometric, and typological
data to construct detailed ceramic seriation chronologies
covering the Late Prehistoric-Woodland period for four subareas/regions within the Upper Texas Coast: Galveston Bay
(Aten 1983a:282-290, Figures 14.1-14.2), the Sabine Lake area
(Aten 1983a:272-282), and the Brazos Delta/West Bay (Aten
1983a:290-292, Figure 14.3-14.4) and inland ConroeLivingston (Aten 1983a:292-296, Figure 14.5) areas.
Aten (1979, 1983a) subdivided the Ceramic period in
each area into subperiods defined principally by changes in
the relative frequencies of ceramic types and varieties as
well as by the presence/absence of other artifact types such
as bifacial arrow points and socketed bone projectile points.
As a result of the relative abundance of archeological data
available there, Aten's Galveston Bay ceramic seriation is
the most detailed. Five named subperiods, each lasting only
a few hundred years, were defined along with two historic
periods (one named); the latter ending with the effective
extinction or expulsion of native cultural groups by the midnineteenth century. The beginning and ending dates of each
period in the seriation chronology are based on 64 radiocarbon determinations and are described in sidereal years (for
radiocarbon years see Aten 1983a:Table 14.2). The accuracy
of these dates (in absolute terms) has been questioned, with
many researchers who believe that one or more periods are
several hundred years too young (see below). For present
purposes, however, Aten's dates are provisionally retained
in the following descriptions.
The Late Prehistoric could of course be subdivided a
number of other ways. For example, unlike Aten's Galveston
Bay chronology, which is based primarily on frequency
changes in ceramic types, some researchers have emphasized the introduction of bifacial arrow points or the later
appearance of grog-tempered pottery as the boundary between an Early and Late Ceramic Period particularly inland
(e.g., see discussion in Story 1990:255-276). Aten acknowledged that his typology, which was explicitly designed as a
chronological tool, was not the only way to organize the
Upper Texas Coast ceramic data and that in the future additional types and/or varieties might need to be defined to
address different (i.e., nonchronometeric) research goals or
to accommodate new data. For example, the polymodality of
certain key ceramic types, particularly Goose Creek, suggest
that existing categories obscure meaningful variability and
might be further subdivided in the future.

Chapter 4: Cultural Background

Clear Lake Period (A.D. 100 to 425)
In many ways, the Clear Lake period is characterized as
much by continuity with the preceding Late Archaic as by
the significant change evident in the initial appearance of
pottery. However, the adoption, development, and integration of ceramic technology into an existing local cultural
tradition must have necessitated some degree of systemic
change. With the exception of the introduction of ceramics,
other material remains such as lithic and bone artifacts remained largely unchanged and there appears to have been
little change in subsistence and settlement adaptations.
Socketed bone projectile points and stone dart points such
as Gary and Kent types continued to be made. Weinstein et
al. (1988: 133-135) suggest that a smaller Hobson variety of
the ubiquitous Gary point may also be diagnostic of the
Clear Lake period. The greatest abundance of sandstone
abraders also occurs in this period although they are found
throughout the ceramic period sequence.
The early Clear Lake period is characterized by a greater
diversity of ceramic types than any other period, probably
due to either cultural borrowing and/or experimentation.
These include predominately silty, contorted-paste wares
that are morphologically indistinguishable from Lower Mississippi Valley ceramics such as Tchefuncte and Mandeville.
Intermediate ceramic forms such as Goose Creek var.
Anahuac may represent local production of extraregional
types or evolutionary stages in the development of a local,
sandy-paste ceramic tradition. Goose Creek wares generally
occur as relatively simple, small- to medium-sized jars, beakers, and bowls with rounded bases and relatively straight
(vertical) walls (Ellis 1994; Howard 1990; Ricklis 1994; Ring
1994; Weinstein 1991 ). Minor elements found in Clear Lake
period sites include O'Neal Plain var. Conway (a sand-tempered ware), which may represent borrowing from the Sabine
River area where ceramic technology was adopted somewhat earlier and where sand tempering persists throughout
the prehistoric cultural sequence. The Lower Mississippi
Valley ceramic types (Tchefuncte Plain and Stamped,
Mandeville Plain), O'Neal var. Conway, and the Anahuac
variety of Goose Creek are all exclusively confined to this
earliest ceramic period in the Galveston Bay area.
Accurate dating of the initial appearance of pottery in
the Galveston Bay area (and hence the beginning of the
Clear Lake period) remains a matter of some debate (Howard
etal.1991;Kibleretal.1996;Weinstein 1986). This is primarily a consequence of uncertainty regarding the effects of
Aten's corrections for radiocarbon dates on shell. Aten
(1983a:286) also points out that many radiocarbon dates on
preceramic shell middens overlap with dated Clear Lake period components, which he attributes to the low density of
ceramics at these early sites and therefore difficulty in discerning ceramic from preceramic sites. Thus, positive instances must be necessarily emphasized over negative (i.e.,
no ceramic) cases.

19

Aten (1983a:287-288) distinguishes an early and late
division of the Clear Lake period. The early part is dominated by Mandeville Plain with lesser quantities of Goose
Creek var. Anahuac, Tchefuncte Plain, and O'Neal Plain var.
Conway. The later part is dominated by Goose Creek Plain
var. unspecified, with secondary occurrences of Goose Creek
Incised, Goose Creek Stamped, and the continued presence
of Tchefuncte Plain. Among other proposed revisions of
Aten's UTC ceramic typology, Weinstein (1991) suggests
elevating the unspecified variety of Goose Creek Plain to
type status. However, in order to avoid potential confusion
and for the sake of continuity, Aten's original (1983a) types
and varieties are retained here. Occasional sherds of Goose
Creek Red-Filmed may occur late in the Clear Lake period
while rocker-stamping as a decorative technique is wholly
restricted to this period.
Mayes Island Period (A.D. 425-650)
The Mayes Island period (from A.D. 425 to A.D. 650) is
characterized by an almost complete homogeneity in ceramic
assemblages, consisting almost entirely of undecorated
Goose Creek Plain var. unspecified sherds with only occasional occurrences of the Goose Creek Red-filmed or Incised
types. Dart points and socketed bone projectile points occur in Mayes Island components but pass out of the material record during its latter stages or early in the subsequent
Turtle Bay period. Bifacial arrow points enter the material
record at about the same time, accompanied by an increased
number of gastroliths, which may have been a primary source
oflithic raw material (Aten 1983a:304, Appendix B). Patterson
(1982:22, 1995) has proposed that use of the bow and arrow
actually began much earlier on the Upper Texas Coast, but
his hypothesis is based on the controversial identification
of marginally retouched unifacial fragments as "arrow
points" (e.g., Story 1990:248-251). The appearance of small,
bifacial points during the Late Prehistoric, between roughly
A.D. 500 and A.D. 700, on the Upper Texas Coast is in closer
agreement with the inferred introduction of the bow and
arrow in adjacent areas (cf. Aten 1983a:306; Prewitt 1981 :8283). Contemporaneous use of both dart points and arrow
points probably occurred in the latter stages of the Mayes
Island period on the coast while dart points apparently persisted in the inland Conroe-Livingston area until historic
times (Aten 1983a:Figure 15.2). The disappearance of socketed bone points (in use since the Preceramic) at around A.D.
650 mirrors similar changes in the Lower Mississippi Valley
and coastal Louisiana areas (Weinstein 1991 :33).
Turtle Bay (A.D. 650-1000)
The Turtle Bay period (extending from A.D. 650 to ca.
1000) witnessed an increase in the frequency of Goose
Creek Red-filmed and an elaboration of design motifs within
the type Goose Creek Incised. Undecorated Goose Creek
A.D.

Plain var. unspecified ceramics, however, continued to dominate the assemblages. Small amounts of bone tempered pottery may have appeared during this period (Aten 1983a:288).
Lithic drills and perforators are common in late Turtle
Bay assemblages (along with microflints, which intially appear in the preceramic and continued throughout the remainder of the Prehistoric period), although rather than a
fundamental change in aboriginal toolkits, this may reflect
sampling bias due to the low density of lithic material at
Upper Texas Coast sites (Aten 1983a:304, Figure 15.2). As
mentioned, socketed bone projectile points, and what is believed to be associated manufacturing debris, disappeared
early in this period. Arrows clearly replaced dart points in
the Galveston Bay area by this time (Aten 1983a:302-304). In
addition, cemeteries appeared in the beginning of the Turtle
Bay period and continued into protohistoric times.

Round Lake Period (A.D. 1000-1350)
The Round Lake period began at about A.O. 1000 with
the initial appearance of grog-tempered ceramics in the
Galveston Bay area. Frequencies of the Goose Creek types
steadily decline, to near extinction by the end of the period.
By that time, the Phoenix Lake variety of Baytown Plain
(with abundant grog inclusions in a silty-clay paste) dominated Galveston Bay ceramic assemblages (Aten 1983a:288).
The popularity of grog-tempered wares clearly increased at
the expense of sandy paste, Goose Creek types during the
Round Lake period. Vessel forms appear to have been primarily straight-walled jars and wide-mouth bowls (e.g., Ellis
1994; Howard 1990; Ricklis 1994; Weinstein 1991).
Weinstein ( 1991: 102-107) has proposed that the type
Baytown be reserved only for those ceramics having relatively abundant grog inclusions in a silty- (rather then sandy)
clay paste, which is more consistent with use of the term in
the Lower Mississippi Valley. He also suggests that the San
Jacinto type be used only for pottery with less abundant
grog in a sandy-clay paste that may represent a local variant
or indigenous expression of the Baytown type. In Weinstein's
proposed typology, undecorated sandy-paste, grog-tempered ceramics would be classified as San Jacinto Plain var.
San Jacinto, and their decorated counterparts as San Jacinto
Incised var. Jamison (cf. Aten 1983a). Weinstein's formulation essentially describes the same variability recognized in
Aten's distinction between the Phoenix Lake and San Jacinto
varieties of.undecorated Baytown Plain wares on the one
hand, and the Jamison and Spindletop varieties of San
Jacinto Incised on the other (Aten 1983a:239-242).
Story (1990:249-251) suggests that Perdiz (or in some
places, Bassett) arrow points appeared on the Upper Texas
Coast after ca. A.O. 1200, replacing forms with slightly expanded or rectangular stems (including Alba and Catahoula)
that are estimated to date between ca. A.O. 800 or 900 and
A.O. 1200. Patterson (1996:23) counters that all major arrow

point types in southeast Texas were probably in concurrent
use during most of the Late Prehistoric period.

Old River Period (A.D. 1350-1700)
The Old River period, from A.O. 1350 to about A.O. 1700,
began with the continued dominance of Baytown Plain var.
Phoenix Lake, but the period is marked by a major decrease
in grog-tempered ceramics and a resurgence of the sandypaste types. The latter includes both the Incised and Redfilmed varieties, although undecorated Goose Creek Plain
sherds continued to dominate. Bone-tempered ceramics were
clearly established in the Galveston Bay area (Aten
1983a:288; Story 1990:260), possibly representing influence
from Caddoan areas to the north (Weinstein 1991:34) and/or
Central Texas to the west (e.g., Leon Plain type, Patterson
1996:47). However, Aten does not define a formal type or
variety for bone-tempered wares, preferring instead an ad
hoc descriptive terminology. Weinstein (1991:34) suggests
that the addition of bone to local sandy-paste ceramics as
well as the use of decorative excising, both of which appear
in the Old River period, almost certainly indicate influence
from Caddoan areas to the north. Recognizably Caddoan
ceramics are rare on the coast (including Galveston Bay) but
do occur with some frequency in more inland areas such as
the Conroe-Livingston region (Aten 1983a:295).
Several decorative styles and design motifs in both the
earlier Round Lake and Old River periods%including zoned
designs, punctations, and grid motifs%are remarkably similar to several Lower Mississippi Vallay and Louisiana coastal
types and may be imitations of Lower Mississippi Vallay
Plaquemine and Coles Creek period styles (e.g., Ricklis
1994:208-212). Weinstein (1991 :34) suggests that this indicates "some form of contact with aboriginal groups situated
to the east." These decorative designs may eventually provide the basis for the identification of additional varieties
within both grog-tempered and sandy-paste types (Aten
1983a:233-234, 242; Ricklis 1994). Along these lines, Ricklis
(1994:212-213) has identified both primary and secondary
decorative elements at the Mitchell Ridge site (41 GV66) on
Galveston Island and, furthermore, proposes the addition of
two new types%Goose Creek Modified Lip (sandy paste)
and San Jacinto Modified Lip (grog tempered)3Aboth of which
may be further subdivided into varieties including Scalloped,
Nicked, and Incised. It is not clear, however, what if any
temporal information might be reflected in these new types,
beyond the paste, temper, and decorative element categories already established in Aten's (1983a) ceramic seriation.
The latter half of the Old River period overlaps with the
earliest European accounts of native groups on the Upper
Texas Coast. European trade goods may occur in some Old
River period sites but this is unlikely given the extremely low
levels of interaction at this early period (i.e., prior to the
incursion of French traders and Spanish missionaries in the

Chapter 4: Cultural Background

eighteenth century). Use of the bow and arrow expanded
significantly in the late Old River Period, possibly related to
either a renewed focus on bison hunting (cf. Dillehay 1974)
or perhaps the inception of the French fur trade (see below)
in the first half of the eighteenth century (Aten 1983a:322).

Orcoquisac Period (A.D. 1700-ca. 1810)
The Orcoquisac (or Early Historic) period extends from
the end of the Old River period at around A.D. 1700 to about
the first or second decade of the nineteenth century (Aten
1983a:288),just prior to the first major influx or wave of immigration and settlement of the Galveston Bay area by Stephen
F. Austin's Old Three-Hundred (Tyler et al. 1996). The name
of this period is derived from the historical Akokisa (or
Orcoquisac) Indian inhabitants of the Galveston Bay area,
as well as the Spanish mission and presidio complex located
near Anahuac termed "El Orcoquisac" (Aten 1983a:35). Aten
distinguishes a separate, unnamed historic period following
the Orcoquisac which lasted to approximately mid-century,
by which time native cultures in the Galveston Bay area
effectively ceased to exist.
Material remains dating to the Orcoquisac period may
include trade goods obtained through Spanish missions or
French traders (cf. Fullen 1978; Ricklis 1994). These might
include ceramics (e.g., majolica and faience ), glass, and beads
(Gilmore 1974; Tunnell and Ambler 1967). Native ceramics
demonstrate an increasing uniformity and decreasing stylistic variability during this period. Grog-tempered wares nearly
disappear from the record, as do frequencies of all types
except Goose Creek Plain.
Criticism and Alternative Chronologies
Of course, not all researchers agree entirely with Aten's
typology and seriation chronologies and no doubt Aten
himself might wish to modify certain elements in light of
more recent research and new data. For example, as already
mentioned, both Weinstein (e.g., 1991) and Ricklis (e.g., 1994)
have proposed new or revised ceramic types and varieties.
Perhaps more significantly, several researchers have questioned the accuracy of the dates of one or more periods
comprising Aten's Galveston Bay chronology (e.g., Howard
et al. 1991; Kibler et al. 1996:55; Ricklis 1994; Weinstein 1991).
For the most part, such challenges to Aten's seriation chronology arise from questions regarding (1) the validity of
associations between dated materials and individual archeo1o gical site components; (2) the corrections Aten
(1983a:Appendix A) applied to shell radiocarbon determinations (a topic discussed in detail in Chapter 5, herein); and/
or (3) the small sample sizes of the individual ceramic components used in its construction. Comprehensive summaries of one or more of these issues are provided by Ricklis
(1994:17-21) and Howard et al. (1991:11-14). A number of
investigators (Bailey et al. 1987; Howard et al. 1991; Kibler et

21

al.1992:21;Weinstein 1986, 1991;Weinsteinetal.1988)have
suggested that Aten's dates for the first introduction of
ceramics into the Galveston Bay area (which he originally
placed at about A.O. 100) may be too young by as much as
several hundred years. Weinstein (1986:119-120) in particular points out that removing Aten's Rangia shell correction
factor brings the earliest Clear Lake period components in
Galveston Bay more in line with dated Tchefuncte components in Louisiana (see also Weinstein 1991 :32-33). Furthermore, there is some evidence that Aten's Galveston Bay
seriation may not be effective for accurately dating particular ceramic assemblages (e.g., Ellis and Ellis 1995). In some
cases, alternative site-specific chronologies have been employed (e.g., Ricklis 1994:21-23), while others have developed typologies based on technological criteria to better
understand the role and articulation of ceramic technology
to the cultural system in a more holistic fashion (e.g., Ellis
1992; Ellis and Ellis 1995; Winchell and Ellis 1991). While
alternative chronologies and typologies are clearly useful
and have yielded new insights, none are intended (or are yet
sufficiently developed) to supplant Aten's chronology for
the entire Galveston Bay area. In short, despite its shortcomings as an absolute chronology, Aten's Ceramic period
chronology remains a particularly effective relative chronological tool, especially for those periods identified by unique
or exclusive artifact occurrences that do not occur in other/
later time periods (e.g., temperless Lower Mississippi Valley
ceramics in the Clear Lake period).
Farther inland in the Conroe-Livingston area, the Ceramic period may be conveniently divided into an early and
late period (Story 1990:275-276). The Early period is evidenced
by the co-occurrence of sandy-paste pottery and dart points
between ca. A.O. 100 and A.O. 800 to 900. The Late period is
characterized principally by arrow points and grog-tempered
ceramics (including decorated Caddoan types), although
local sandy-paste wares continued to be manufactured. Dart
points may have persisted inland until some time during the
Old River period or even into historic times (Aten
1983a:Figure 15.2). The coincidence ofCaddoan and local
types along the northern fringe of the Upper Texas Coast
suggests this may have been an "ethnic borderland" between the Mossy Grove and Caddoan heartlands (Story
1990:276).
Galveston Bay Ceramic Period Summary and Discussion
The Late Prehistoric-Woodland period on the Upper
Texas Coast was clearly a time of both continuity with earlier
periods as well as cultural change. While basic subsistence
and settlement adaptations initially remained largely unchanged from late preceramic times, the adoption of several
energy-harnessing technologies by A.O. 800 (i.e., by the middle
of the Turtle Bay period) probably do suggest significant
cultural change or at least intensification of resource use
(Aten 1984, Story 1990:265). Apart from the introduction

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

22

and integration of ceramic technology, these include the
adoption of the bow and arrow and the probable use of tidal
fish weirs. The rising energy demands implied by these innovations were likely the result of either increasing population or decreasing access to resources due to the establishment of cultural boundaries; the latter necessitating either
an intensification or expansion of the available resource base.
Cemeteries dating to the Ceramic period (e.g., the Harris
County Boys School [41HR80/85]; Aten et al. 1976), which
first appeared in the early Turtle Bay period at ca. A.O. 650,
may reflect increased territoriality or preferential access to
particular resource areas. Aten (1983a:321-323) suggests that
the coincident appearance of cemeteries, the adoption of
the bow and arrow, and the probable use of fish weirs signal
a shift in subsistence/settlement strategy characterized by
longer stays at fewer localities (Aten et al. 1976: 100). He
speculates that this shift may have been a response to subtle
but significant environmental changes reflected, for example,
by declining numbers of bison at about the same time (cf.
Dillehay 1974). Marked increase in the use of the bow and
arrow in the late Old River or early Orcoquisac periods, along
with possible reliance on horses by at least ca. 1720 (see
Simars de Bellisle account below), may likewise be related to
the return of large numbers of bison to the coastal plain.
While interregional differences did become more pronounced during the Late Prehistoric period, significant culture contact and exchange with adjacent areas also appears
to have been an important factor. For example, there appear
to have been at least two distinct periods of cultural influence from the Lower Mississippi Valley and coastal Louisiana. The first is evident in the time-transgressive pattern in
the initial introduction of ceramics from east to west along
the Upper Texas Coast and the presence of distinctive ceramic types (such as Tchefuncte and O'Neal) in the earliest
ceramic periods, and the second recognized by grog-tempered wares (such as Baytown) and decorative motifs and
design techniques beginning ca. A.O. 1000. Likewise, possible Caddoan or north-central Texas influences may be indicated by bone tempering and excising (Weinstein 1991).
THEPROTOIIlSlORICANDEARLY
IIlSlORICPERIODS
The transition from prehistory to history on the Texas
Coast was neither immediate nor uniform. In many areas, a
brief transitional "Protohistoric" period is recognized between the initial appearance of European goods or individuals and the actual arrival of colonizing European populations. As Aten ( 1983a:289) has pointed out, the first Europeans on the Texas coast (between 1528 and the first quarter of
the eighteenth century) probably had little direct impact on
native societies and lifeways, excepting of course the introduction of devastating diseases against which native populations had no immunity (e.g., Ramenofsky 1987; Smith 1987).
Shipwrecked or marooned individuals, such as Cabeza de

Vaca and Simars de Bellisle, were "functioning essentially as
natives" while early explorers and would-be colonists like
de Leon and LaSalle kept the native groups they encountered at arm's length. The result is an extended Protohistoric
period lasting nearly two centuries. It has been proposed
that the Historic period in the Galveston Bay area really
began sometime between 1725 and 1740 when the French
succeeded in establishing an active fur trade (Aten 1983a;
Ricklis 1994:32-39). Aten's Protohistoric period therefore falls
within the latter half of the Old River period (A.O. 1350 to
1700) and extends somewhat into the beginning of the
Orcoquisacperiod (A.O. 1700-1810). Ricklis (1994:24-43) subdivides the same time period in a similar way, paying particular attention to the broader context of European colonization
and trade prior to the 1750s. While Native-European relations were limited during the Protohistoric, it was a time
when important ethnohistoric accounts were obtained. The
Historic period on the other hand was initially characterized
by economic symbiosis but, following the influx of AngloAmerican settlers in the 1820s, shifted to actively antagonistic and hostile relationships that eventually resulted in
the demise and removal of aboriginal groups from the Upper
Texas Coast by mid-century.

Ethnohistorical Accounts
From an anthropological perspective, the advantages
of an extended Protohistoric and Early Historic period, during which Galveston Bay remained peripheral to Spanish
and French colonization of adjacent areas but close enough
for limited contacts, are obvious. Ricklis (1994:35) has stated
that "the native peoples of coastal Louisiana and the upper
Texas coast were probably among the last groups to be directly affected by the European colonization of the Gulf
coastal plain". The following section briefly describes early
accounts of native cultures on the Upper Texas Coast and
the broader sociopolitical and economic conditions affecting relationships between and among native groups and
Europeans during this critical juncture in history.
Ethnohistoric accounts are an important source of data
in their own right as well as in generating archeological hypotheses. Both Aten (1983a) and Ricklis (1994:23) have
adopted a cautiously inclusive approach to these early
ethnohistoric accounts. While it is clear that they describe
various native groups at different times, it is likely that these
cultures shared many commonalties in terms of broad cultural patterns and basic subsistence/settlement adaptations.
Judiciously combining the often fragmentary information
available from these accounts yields a more complete picture of dynamic native cultures on the Upper Texas Coast.
The reliability and accuracy of these sources is assessed in
detail by both Aten (1983a) and Ricklis (1990, 1994, 1996).
When combined with archeological data, ethnohistorical
records permit the development of a comprehensive model
of Late Prehistoric cultures and lifeways on the Upper Texas

Chapter 4: Cultural Background

Coast, as outlined in the final section ofthis chapter (following Aten 1979, 1983a).
Early Explorers and Castaways
Ricklis (1990, 1994:24-43) has identified three major periods ofEuroamerican-Aboriginal interaction, beginning with
the Protohistoric, between ca. A.D. 1500 and 1700. Following
Columbus's "discovery" of the Americas, the first decades
of the sixteenth century witnessed the exploration of the
Southeast and eastern Gulf coast and the early colonization
of New Spain (Mexico) and Florida (Deagan 1990; Milanich
1990). The western Gulf remained peripheral to these developments but was nevertheless penetrated and explored intermittently by both overland and coastal expeditions. The
hazardous nature of the latter is evidenced by the many
sailors and explorers known to have been shipwrecked and
marooned along the western Gulf coast during this early
period, of which only a handful of recorded accounts remam.
The primary account from this period is that of Alvar
Nunez Cabeza de Vaca who, along with other members of the
Narvaez Expedition (Marrinan et al. 1990), was shipwrecked
on the Texas Coast in November 1528. There are several
translations of Cabeza de Vaca's Relacion (e.g., Bandelier
1905; Covey 1961; Hallenbeck 1940; Hodge 1907), as well as
a summary known as the Combined Report, coauthored by
Cabeza de Vaca, Andres Dorantes, and Alonzo del Castillo
(e.g., Oviedo y Valdez 1923). The 1905 Bandelier translation
is heavily relied on by both Aten and Ricklis for discerning
ethnographic detail while a more recent translation by LopezMorillas (Pupo-Walker 1993) is preferred by Hickerson (1998).
Cabeza de Vaca spent several years living with native groups
in and around the Galveston Bay area and became a trader.
In that capacity he traveled extensively to inland areas and
along the coast and consequently interacted with a wide
variety of native cultures, an experience which undoubtedly
assisted him in later negotiating his way back to New Spain,
nearly eight years after first being marooned (cf. Hickerson
1998).
Cabeza de Vaca's account is an invaluable record of the
operation of coastal cultural adaptations and interactions. It
is generally agreed that Cabeza de Vaca and the others landed
on the Upper Texas Coast, probably on Galveston Island
(Aten 1983a:25; Newcomb 1983). The Spaniards were soon
met by a group of about 100 armed men who conveyed them
back to their village on the island. This suggests a village
population of several hundred people who subsisted on the
island from October to February mainly on fish and starchy
roots (Ricklis 1994:25-26). In the spring and summer, the natives split into smaller groups (bands) consisting of several
related families and traveled inland to gather shellfish, and
hunt deer and buffalo. These were clearly hunter-gatherers
who followed a seasonal subsistence/settlement pattern with
yearly aggregation followed by warm-season dispersal into

23

smaller groups. There are no indications in Cabeza de Vaca's
account that horticulture was practiced.
Cabeza de Vaca's Relacfon includes details on population sizes and densities, subsistence/settlement systems,
ethnic groups and territorial boundaries, social organization, trade, exchange, reciprocity, and even ritual and belief
systems. These observations provide a glimpse of the operation of aboriginal coastal societies and a "functioning
regional exchange system" (Hickerson 1998:216), prior to
the severe cultural disruptions resulting from later colonization and conflict.

Early Historic Exploration and Thade
Ricklis 's ( 1990, 1994) second ethnohistorical period%the
Early Historic%begins with the initial incursion of French
traders and missionaries into the Mississippi Valley and exploration along the Gulf Coast beginning in the 1680s and
the subsequent establishment of extensive trading networks
in the first quarter of the eighteenth century. The first attempt to colonize the Texas coast was undertaken by LaSalle
in 1685 near Matagorda Bay. Several firsthand accounts of
LaSalle's settlement and of native groups in on the central
coast are available from a handful of survivors (see Cox
1905; Joutel 1712; Minet 1987; Weddle 1987). Although ultimately unsuccessful, LaSalle's colony stimulated active interest and exploration of Texas by the Spanish, who feared
French intrusions into what was considered part of New
Spain (Bolton 1915; Ricklis 1990, 1994:29). In particular, renewed Spanish concern is evidenced by two separate expeditions to locate LaSalle's Fort St. Louis. The first in 1687
explored along the Texas coast, including portions of
Galveston Bay, but failed to find the French settlement. Nonetheless, the diary of Barroto ( 1987), a memberof the expedition, offers additional details about native groups along the
coast, but clearly from an outsider's point of view. A second, overland expedition in the spring of 1689 did relocate
Fort St. Louis but found it burned and looted by nearby
aboriginal groups. The report of this expedition (West 1905,
cited in Ricklis 1994:29-30), commanded by Alonso de Le6n,
adds additional detail to the picture of native cultures in the
last decades of the seventeenth century.
Almost two hundred years after Cabeza de Vaca, a small
group of Frenchmen were also shipwrecked on the shores of
Galveston Bay in the winter of 1719 (Folmer 1940; Ricklis
1994:30-32). The only survivor, SimarsdeBellisle, lived for
little more than a year with a local Indian group (probably
the Akokisa, see below). De Bellisle's account of this period
is similar to de Vaca's in recounting high mobility hunting
and gathering by small, dispersed groups in inland areas
during the summer and winter aggregation into larger, kinrelated groups at the "end of the bay" (Folmer 1940:217).
Ambiguity regarding the location of such gatherings and
the nature of wintertime subsistence practices has led to
some disagreement about native subsistence/settlement

24

adaptations in the early eighteenth century (discussed below). To what degree native subsistence patterns might have
been altered by this time (e.g., by the introduction of the
horse and the reorganization of cultural groups and territories) is unclear. Eventually, de Bellisle was repatriated through
Hasinai (Caddoan) intermediaries (Freeman 1990:368).
By 1720, French trading networks had expanded into
interior Louisiana and northeastern Texas while Spanish missions and associated presidios were established in San Antonio, northeast Texas, and on the lower Guadalupe River
(see discussion in Riclclis 1994:32-36). Shortly thereafter,
quasi-annual French trading expeditions to the Galveston
Bay area commenced (Ricklis 1994:35-39). This marks the
beginning of Ricldis's third and final ethnohistorical period
characterized by intensification oflndian-European interaction and trade relations. Again, reports of French incursions
prompted a Spanish response (Hale and Freeman 1978: 119122). Two overland expeditions from Presidio La Bahia on
the lower Guadalupe, the first in 1745-1746 and the second in
1748, encountered large native Bidai and Akokisa villages at
the mouth of the Trinity River and farther upstream, respectively (official reports of Orobio y Bazterra, cited in Ricklis
1994). Confirmation of French trading activities, along with
reports of the establishment of a trading post on the Trinity
River, led to a Spanish military excursion in October 1754
that located the post and captured several Frenchmen, including Joseph Blancpain (Freeman 1990:369). Records of
Blancpain's interrogation detail many aspects of the French
deerskin trade and the European goods then available to
aboriginal groups on the Upper Texas Coast (see discussion
inRicklis 1994:37-38).
A Spanish mission and presidia complex, El Orcoquisac,
was established in 1756 at the site of Blancpain's post,
roughly 8 km upstream from the mouth of the Trinity River,
in order to consolidate Spanish control of the Galveston
Bay area (Bolton 1915; Gilmore 1974; Tunnell and Ambler
1967). Unfortunately for Spanish interests, however, this
settlement was largely unsuccessful and was eventually
abandoned in 1771. This apparently marks the last attempt
at actual colonization of the Galveston Bay area until the
early 1820s when Stephen F. Austin, acting as an empresario
for Mexico, initiated and supported the first large-scale Anglo
settlement of the Upper Texas Coast (Freeman 1990; Hoyt et
al. 1998:27-28; multiple entries in Tyler et al. 1996). The aggressive attitude of the Anglo-American settlers to the Austin
Colony allowed little room for nonviolent contact. Most contemporaneous accounts of native groups on the Upper Texas
Coast in the early nineteenth century are either overtly hostile or clearly sympathetic (Aten 1983a:6). Nonetheless, important secondhand accounts of native groups on the Texas
coast in the early 1800s are available from interviews conducted later in the century (e.g., Gatschet 1891; Dyer 1916,
1917, cited in Aten 1983a). The combination of continued
depopulation and hostilities eventually drove the last rem-

nants of native cultural groups from the Galveston Bay area
and Upper Texas Coast by the mid-1800s (cf. Moore 1992).

Nineteenth Century Euro-American Settlement
A detailed discussion of the post-1820 history of the
Galveston Bay area, and more specifically the project area, is
beyond the scope of the current report, which instead concentrates on prehistoric cultural resources. Detailed reviews
of the history of southeast Texas generally and the project
area in particular are available elsewhere (e.g., Alperin 1977;
Freeman 1990; Kibler et al. 1996; Sibley 1968; and various
entries in Tyler et al. 1996). The histories of individual locations investigated by TARL during the course of this project
are included where appropriate in Chapters 6 and 7 of this
report, which are intended to supplement more comprehensive treatments of historic resource investigations in companion studies by Espey, Huston, and Associates (e.g., Foster et al. 1993; Hoyt et al. 1998; Schmidt and Foster 1997).
The following is a very brief overview of the broad trends
and factors that are most relevant for considering the history of the immediate project area.
Following initial settlement of the Galveston Bay area in
the 1820s, the mainly American settlers grew increasingly
resentful of Mexican taxation and policies, eventually resulting in the Texas Revolution of 1836. In fact, a number of
locales within or very near the current project area were sites
of either important events (e.g., the decisive Battle of San
Jacinto and Santa Anna's burning of New Washington) or
the residences of prominent figures in the conflict (e.g., the
President and Vice President of the Revolutionary Government, David Burnet and Lorenzo de Zavala, respectively).
These are described in detail where appropriate in Chapters
6and 7.
The brief period of the independent Texas Republic
ended in 1845 with annexation to the United States and was
followed by continued population growth and agriculturalcommercial development. The Civil War and Reconstruction
proved a temporary setback for the local and regional economies as evidenced by relatively rapid postwar recovery and
rebuilding efforts (e.g., Freeman 1990:376-381; Kibler et al.
1996). By the last quarter of the nineteenth century, growing
economic competition between Houston and Galveston led
to the first serious efforts to develop shipping and railroad
transportation facilities, including what would eventually
became the Houston Ship Channel. Devastating hurricanes
in 1875, 1900, and 1915, along with expansion of the Houston Ship Channel and continued railroad development, solidified Houston's preeminence as a major economic center
and inland port city. The discovery of significant oil reserves
and the subsequent development of refining capacity beginning in World War I ushered in a new era of economic
and commercial expansion of the Upper Galveston Bay-Houston Ship Channel corridor that continues to this day.

Chapter 4: Cultural Background

Aboriginal Cultures on the Upper Texas Coast
Synthesizing data from both ethnohistorical sources
and archeological investigations, Aten (1979, 1983a) developed a holistic model of native cultural development and
operation on the Upper Texas Coast. The following is a brief
review of the basic components and relevant aspects of
Aten's summary model, many of which have already been
touched upon in this chapter, as well as pertinent observations and speculations reported by others (e.g., Ricklis 1990,
1994).
In the middle eighteenth century, a number of culturallinguistic groups occupied the Upper Texas Coast: the Sabine
Lake area and coastal Louisiana were inhabited by the
Atakapa; the upper Galveston Bay area by a related people
known as the Akokisa (or Orcoquiza) who, along with the
Bidai farther inland, spoke an Atakapan-related dialect; and
finally south and west of Galveston Bay and along the Central Coast, perhaps five distinct groups collectively referred
to as "Karankawa," one of whom (probably the Coco) occupied the Brazos Delta/West Bay area. The Bidai and Akokisa
were essentially tribal ethnic groupings whereas the term
Karankawa refers more accurately to a larger linguistic grouping of related tribal entities. A clear sociocultural and linguistic boundary between the Akokisa and Coco-Karankawa
existed along or immediately southwest of Galveston Bay.
The territory of the Akokisa has been estimated at about
12,400 km2 , including the lower Trinity and San Jacinto Rivers (Aten 1983a:36; Figure 3.1 ). Both Aten ( 1983a) and Ricklis
(1990, 1994, 1996) have noted that while ethnohistoric accounts relate specifically to different native groups, all were
probably quite similar in terms of general adaptations and
cultural patterns.
The basic socioeconomic unit on the Upper Texas
Coast was the "band," composed of several related families. During the warm season, individual bands practiced a
highly mobile subsistence/settlement strategy as described
by de Bellisle and Cabeza de Vaca. In the winter, bands
coalesced into larger "villages" of several hundred persons each. Based in part on eighteenth century Spanish
and French accounts, Aten (1983a:34-36, 77-78) suggests

25

that these cold-season villages were located inland, while
Ricklis (1994) and others (e.g., Dering and Ayers 1977) maintain that they were instead on the barrier islands (following
de Vaca's earlier report). It is unclear whether settlement
patterns changed over the approximately 200 years separating these two ethnohistoric periods. By the beginning
of the Historic period, the Akokisa were comprised of probably five villages with a total population of about 1,200
(Aten 1983a:60-62). Villages and bands were led by "headmen," but social organization was essentially egalitarian
with status ascribed mainly on the basis of personal qualities or age and gender classes. Shamans were apparently
granted special privileges which included cremation and
multiple wives.
Barrier island, estuary, and inland (riverine and savanna)
habitats were clearly exploited on a seasonal basis in the
context of a highly scheduled subsistence/settlement strategy. Seasonality data from archeological sites (e.g., Rangia
shell and fish otolith growth studies and vertebrate faunal
analysis) support the inference that such a long-term stable
seasonal exploitation pattern may have been established as
early as the Late Archaic (e.g., Aten et al. 1976). There is no
evidence that prehistoric native groups on the Upper Texas
Coast practiced any form of horticulture although by the
mid-eighteenth century some groups may have adopted certain cultigens (e.g., see 1748 Orobio y Bazterra report cited in
Ricklis 1994:41).
Intragroup economic relationships were characterized
by general reciprocity while trade and exchange relationships were maintained with adjacent groups. Aten ( 1983a:8182) suggests that intergroup relations, sustained in part by
marriage rules, involved patrilineal band exogamy and
virilocal residence. Details of native ritual and cognitive systems are reviewed by Aten (1983a). Rapid population decline, beginning in the first half of the eighteenth century,
resulted in severe sociocultural disruptions and the formation of "composite" bands through the merger of small, previously unrelated groups (Aten 1983a:79). Nevertheless, by
the mid-1800s this native regional cultural tradition ceased
to exist, its last representatives forced to abandon their way
of life or to flee the Upper Texas Coast altogether.

lNTRODUCTION

Shell middens on the Upper Texas Coast are remarkably
variable in terms of their size, topography, and horizontal
and vertical differentiation (Aten 1983a:204-205). Large,
deeply stratified shell middens are often located in riverbank
and deltaic deposits. Smaller, thin shell-bearing sites representing a limited number of individual occupation episodes
are also found in stream terraces (e.g., Aten 1983b). A third
type, shell middens on valley margins vary in terms of depth
and often contain compressed stratigraphy due to reduced
depositional rates in primarily colluvial as opposed to fluvial
settings (e.g., Aten et al. 1976: 12; Gadus and Howard 1990).
While these three ideal types are useful for organizing observed site characteristics, most shell-bearing sites exhibit
some combination of these attributes. Summaries of shell
midden studies on the Upper Texas Coast are provided by
Howard (1990a:l5-18), Story (1990), andAten (1983a). Finally, another common but rarely acknowledged site type in
the Galveston Bay area are "earth middens" (McGuff and
Cox 1973:18-19;McGuffandFord 1974:11-14). These sites
lack shell but are characterized by varying quantities of bone
and artifacts in a sandy loam matrix and often rise subtly but
perceptibly above the surrounding area as a small knoll or
mound. Perhaps due to their low visibility few investigations of these small, relatively nondescript sites have been
conducted although they are apparently rather ubiquitous
and frequently well preserved (see McGuff and Ford 1974:14).
The role of such terrestrial sites in aboriginal adaptive systems and their relationship to shell midden sites is poorly
understood (Kibler et al. 1996:53), but they may be functionally similar to earth middens excavated in the Addicks and
Barker Reservoirs farther inland (e.g., Story 1990:261; Wheat
1953).
The following review of previous archeological research
in and around the project area includes both prehistoric and
historic investigations. They are arranged in rough chronological order except where it makes better sense to keep
different projects in a subarea together for the sake of con ti-

The first section of this chapter is an overview of prehistoric and historic cultural resources and previous investigations in the project area, Galveston Bay, and the Upper
Texas Coast. The emphasis of this discussion is on prehistoric resources but historic resources and studies are also
mentioned where appropriate. Following this review, the second section introduces research issues previously identified in cultural resource planning documents or other reports. This briefreview is weighted toward sites and topics,
such as small site analysis, that are relevant to the results of
the current TARL investigations as presented in Chapters 6
and7.

PREVIOUSINVF.sTIGATIONSINANDNEAR THE
PROJECT AREA
Shell midden sites have provided most of the information on the prehistory of the Upper Texas Coast. The brackish water clam, Rangia cuneata, is the primary constituent
of most middens, with smaller quantities of more saline-tolerant species such as eastern oyster ( Crassostrea virginica)
and Rangia flexuosa. In recognition of the many reasons
why shell can be introduced into archeological deposits,
some researchers have suggested that it may be more accurate to refer to such sites as shell-bearing rather than simply
"middens" which has functional connotations (cf. Ensor
1995: 15-16). Nonetheless, it does appear that virtually all of
the shells recovered from sites in the Galveston Bay area do
in fact represent food remains; formal shell tools are rare on
the Upper Texas Coast. Scholarly interest in understanding
the cultural and natural factors conditioning the structure
and content of shell middens (e.g., Claasen 1991; Stein 1992)
reflects a renewed emphasis on explicating "formation processes" (Schiffer 1976) of the archeological record over the
past quarter century.

nuity. Particular attention is paid to those investigations
pertaining to sites included in the scope of work of the present
TARL project or encountered during the course of fieldwork. Much detail regarding the individual sites is reserved
for discussions in Chapters 6 and 7.

Early Investigations
Prior to the late 1960s, archeological investigations in
the Galveston Bay area and indeed in much of the Upper
Texas Coast were relatively infrequent (see discussion and
summary in Guy 1990). Data on the prehistoric period was
incomplete and attempts to summarize the cultural history of
coastal Texas were necessarily speculative (e.g, Sayles 1935;
Suhm et al. 1954). Wheat's (1953) River Basin Survey investigations at the Addicks Reservoir, begun in the late 1940s,
was the first professional research project in the greater
Galveston Bay area, with the exception of then-unreported
investigations by Pearce and others at the Caplen site on
Galveston Island (Campbell 1957).
The first archeological investigations in the immediate
project area were undertaken in the mid 1950s by two founding members of the Houston Archeological Society (HAS),
Wayne B. Neyland and Richard Worthington. Along with
others such as Alan Duke, W. L. Atwood, and Raymond
Ring these avocational researchers surveyed much of the
shoreline area between the confluence of Buffalo Bayou
with the San Jacinto River and Morgans Point. Worthington
was particularly active in and around Peggy Lake (Gadus
and Howard 1990). Meanwhile, Neyland recorded dozens of
sites in the lower reaches of Buffalo Bayou, along the
bayshores on the eastern side of the Houston Ship Channel
(Burnet, Crystal, and Scott Bays, see McGuff and Ford 1973),
and adjacent areas such as Lost Lake (Fields and Reese
1984) and the Clear Creek drainage (e.g., Weinstein 1991).
Both men were among the first to recognize and appreciate
the devastating effects of erosion, subsidence, and development on cultural resources, especially near shorelines.
They therefore undertook salvage collections and excavations at a number of these sites in a race against the destructive forces eliminating these resources. While not comprehensive, the photographs, notes, and collections describing these efforts (the overwhelming majority of which are
unpublished) are the sole record of many sites that have
since been destroyed or are now inundated and no longer
accessible. Along with the vast amount of material held in
undocumented private collections, these archived data constitute a largely untapped resource for investigating prehistoric and historic occupations in and around the project
area, particularly in terms of mapping the original extent and
density of prehistoric archeological remains.
It was during this time that Neyland recorded a series of
six prehistoric sites along the southeastern (right) bank of
Buffalo Bayou, immediately upstream from the San Jacinto
Battleground State Park (see Figure 1). Four of the sites

(41HR33, 41HR104, 41HR105, and 41HR12l) were shell
middens of varying size and depth exposed in the bankline.
All four were included in the scope-of-work of the current
study. One of the two remaining sites (41HR122) was originally described as a small earth midden on the valley margin
and probably lies within or immediately adjacent to a thin,
upslope remnant of shell-bearing site 41HR121. The final
site (41HR123) is almost certainly deeply buried or destroyed.
Neyland devoted a considerable amount of time and
effort at the largest of these sites (41HR33). The analysis of
the fieldnotes, photographs, and artifacts from this site are
reported elsewhere in this report (Chapter 7 and various
appendices). Results of the current study indicate that none
of the four shoreline sites as originally defined has survived
with the exception of an upslope extension of 41HR121, as
described and reported in Chapter 7.

Initial CRM Surveys
Passage of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966
and related legislation ushered in a new era of archeological
research on the Upper Texas Coast and elsewhere, marked by
a dramatic increase in the volume of cultural resource management (CRM) related studies (Aten 1983a:ll-12; Guy
1990:87). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), as the
result of its operation and maintenance of the HoustonGalveston Navigation Channel (or simply the Houston Ship
Channel), assumed primary responsibility for managing cultural resources along the ship channel and other large-scale
federal undertakings such as the Wallisville Reservoir in the
Trinity River Delta (Stokes 1985). In addition, hundreds of
smaller CRM projects for state, county, municipal, and private
interests have been performed on the Upper Texas Coast.
Unfortunately, the results of many small research projects are
often relegated to the ever-burgeoning "gray literature" generated as a result of archeological compliance.
The first extensive professional survey in the project
area was conducted by personnel of the Texas Archeological Survey (the precursor to TARL) at The University of
Texas at Austin along the shoreline of Burnett [sic], Crystal,
and Scott Bays (McGuff and Ford 1973). McGuff investigated 27 new or previously recorded prehistoric archeological sites in order to assess potential adverse impacts of four
proposed alternative flood control designs. Meanwhile, Ford
conducted archival research on potential historic site localities. Fieldwork involved revisiting each site on foot or by
boat and conducting a surface survey. Landowners were
also interviewed. No subsurface testing was reported. Only
5 of the 27 sites (all but 1 of which were reported to be shell
middens) were found to have intact remnants on emergent
shorelines; the majority having already subsided or reworked
by wave action. (McGuff and Ford 1973: 13, Table 1). McGuff
noted that erosion was considerably more destructive to
shoreline resources than either subsidence or burial by
dredged sediment, both of which typically shielded archeo-

Chapter 5: Previous Investigations

logical components from further destruction.
Later that year, a second survey was undertaken by the
same researchers, but this time covering a greater area and
focusing in particular on several designated dredge disposal
areas (McGuff and Ford 1974). These investigations were
sponsored by the COE in anticipation of navigational improvements to the Houston Ship Channel. Their project area
included the Lost Lake and Hunting Bayou Disposal Areas
as well as the lower reaches of Buffalo Bayou and the Peggy
Lake Disposal Area (Gadus and Howard 1990: 18-19). Fieldwork included the examination of shoreline cutbank profiles
and also adjacent upland surfaces and existing sediment
profiles. Remarkably, 24 of the 38 sites investigated were
originally recorded by Neyland and Worthington (McGuff
and Ford 1974:9). Twenty-eight sites were reported to be
shell middens, and 10 were earth middens. Fewer than half of
the shell middens (n=12), nearly all of which were located
along the shoreline, were found to be in "fair" or "good"
condition. The remainder were found to be in poor condition
or to have been entirely eroded or subsided. Conversely, 8
of the 10 earthen midden sites, all of which were on the
upland valley margins, were found to be in "excellent" condition. These results clearly demonstrate significant differences in preservation potential between these two settings.
During the course of this later TAS survey, McGuff
unsuccessfully attempted (in November 1973) to relocate
Neyland's site 41HR33 along the southeastern bank of Buffalo Bayou (41HR33 TARL site file). He hypothesized that
the site probably remained undisturbed but could not be
relocated due to heavy vegetation albng the.bankline. However, based on the current TARL investigations (see Chapter 7), it now seems more likely that what remained of the
truncated upper portion of the site (after being subjected to
intense erosion caused by shipwakes) had by this time subsided well beneath the watertable and been covered by a
thick mantle of sand. Furthermore, the 1973 bankline was
well eastward of where it had been less than 20 years before
when Neyland originally recorded these sites.
These initial surveys in the project area followed previous CRM investigations in nearby areas including Cedar
Bayou (Ambler 1967), early research in the Wallisville Reservoir area (Ambler 1970, 1973; Shafer 1966), as well as excavations in the Brazos River Delta (Aten 1971). These professional projects were also supplemented by avocational and
student research at sites such as Jamison (Aten 1967), Galena Park (Ring 1994), and the Harris County Boys School
(Aten et al. 1976).

Investigations within the San Jacinto Battleground
State Park
The Coastal Industrial Water Authority (CIWA) was
created in 1967 to distribute water from Lake Livingston. As
part of that mission, CIWA requested permission in the early
1970s to emplace three 9-ft-diameter waterlines across the

29

western part of the San Jacinto Battleground State Park,
roughly parallel with, but slightly east of, Highway 134 or
the Lynchburg Ferry Road. Given existing legislation and in
light of the importance of the battle in Texas history, Rice
University archeologists were contracted to conduct archeological survey and testing along this pipeline (Cartier and
Hole 1972; Hole 1972).
The report of these investigations consists of two main
sections, each of which is supplemented by three appendices. They are essentially separate but related reports. Part I
is a review of the history and prehistory of the greater
Galveston Bay area generally, and of the McCormick League
and San Jacinto Battleground in particular (Cartier and Hole
1972). Included in this first section is an account of the battle
in 1836 that served as a guide for interpreting and predicting
the location of archeological remains in Part II. Unfortunately,
this review relies heavily on a handful of secondary sources
and summary accounts of the battle including the disposition of Texan and Mexican forces before, during, and after
the conflict. Therefore, their treatment of the battle is rather
unspecific, and little effort was made to predict the most
likely areas where archeological remains of the battle might
be located (cf. Chapter 7 this report).
The appendices to the first part supplement and elaborate on the main historical presentation. The first appendix
lists all property transactions for each of the five main parcels comprising the current state park, beginning with the
initial sales from the original grantees (McCormick and his
heirs) through to the acquisition of each parcel by the State
of Texas. These deed records (or title chains) include information on disputes and court actions; several of which pertain in part to adjacent properties, such as the undeveloped
CWA Valve Station No. 1 property discussed below and in
Chapter 7. The second appendix is a useful review of the
local brick-making industry on nearby Cedar Bayou, including firsthand accounts from the early twentieth century (see
Appendix F to this report). The third and final appendix to
the first part of the Rice University report documents the
significant landscape changes that have occurred in and
around the park since the tum of the century. A series of
figures were produced showing shoreline locations and
major landforms, such as sand dikes and levees of dredged
sediment, traced from historical maps and aerial photographs
dating between 1897 and 1969. While these figures and the
accompanying discussion are quite useful and contributed
considerably to the interpretations and conclusions of the
archeological investigations presented in Part II, they might
have been more effectively integrated with the archeological and archival data, particularly in regard to the Battle of
San Jacinto (cf. Chapter 7). However, the researchers clearly
appreciated and conveyed how dramatically dredging, subsidence, erosion, and development have altered the original
landscape in and around the western portion of the park.
The second part of the Rice University report (Hole
1972) presented the results of archeological testing in four

30

separate areas along the pipeline easement, including both
metal detector survey and test excavations. These four areas were defined in part by the apparent absence of overburden using soil core data gathered by field engineers designing the pipelines. Based on the research reported in Part
I, the investigators believed that artifacts related to the Texan
encampment along Buffalo Bayou might be recovered in
this northwestern section of the park. Noting the relative
brevity of the occupation and the known history of intensive surface collecting of battleground souvenirs, they surmised that whatever artifacts might remain would likely be
rare and widely scattered.
The investigators first conducted a metal detector survey, with largely disappointing results. The first tract surveyed (Area II, in the vicinity of the reflecting pool) was
found to be badly disturbed and was excluded from further
analysis. The two adjacent segments farther south (Areas
III and IV) were also apparently devoid of artifacts. Only in a
small extension of Area III south of the park boundary, within
a powerline right-of-way owned by Houston Light and Power,
were objects located using the metal detector. Unfortunately
these turned out to be related to twentieth-century dumping
by the owner of the adjacent property east of Highway 134
(Lynchburg Ferry Road), Mr. D. Besau. As described in
Appendix II to Part II, Besau confirmed the presence of a
family dumpsite in Area III and also reported that in around
1950 he found a cannonball and saber fragment while plowing nearby. That these battle-related objects were recovered
south of the current park boundary is consistent with the
reported locations of the only other artifacts that can confidently be attributed to the battle (Duke 1974a, 1974b). Nevertheless, because these areas were outside of the CIWA
project boundaries, no further work was undertaken in Areas III and IV.
However, the investigation of these areas raised significant questions about the efficacy of the metal detector survey. The primary uncertainty regarded the sensitivity of the
equipment, particularly for heavily rusted artifacts. Additional problems encountered included interference caused
by dense salt grasses and mineral-rich sediments. Detector
sensitivity was addressed in a series of experiments as reported in Appendix I to the second part. These experiments
revealed serious limitations and an "extremely limited range"
of sensitivity (Hole 1972: 164). Small objects such as coins
could only be detected to a depth of one or two inches (less
than 5 cm) while even substantial metal objects, such as
thick pipe, could not be detected below ca. 1 foot (30 cm).
Nevertheless, the negative results for battle-related remains
from Areas III and IV were accepted and no further testing
was undertaken.
The remainder of the Rice University work was concentrated in Area I, the northernmost parcel on a small sandy
hill or rise* north of the reflecting pool and east of the
Lynchburg Ferry Road, roughly due east of the Battleship
Texas (see Figure 1). This may be a portion of the sand dike
described in Appendix III to Part I. Following the metal de-

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

tector survey, which located dozens of metal artifacts, a series of test excavation units and trenches were dug. These
were concentrated around an area suspected to be a house
or other structure; delimited by a halo of metal artifacts surrounding a roughly rectangular area apparently devoid of
such material. A large number of additional artifacts were
recovered during these excavations, including bricks, metal
tools and fragments, historic ceramics, and glass. However,
the subsurface deposits were found to be composed of alternating sandy and silty clay layers containing both scattered historic artifacts and discontinuous lenses of oyster
and Rangia shell. Hole ( 1972: 125) concluded that the artifacts and sediments were in secondary context and represented material dredged, probably in the 1930s, from original
locations within the former San Jacinto townsite along the
former right (southeast) bank of Buffalo Bayou. The various
metal implements were believed to be derived from a sawmill
and shipyards known to have been located nearby. No intact archeological deposits or artifacts related to the Battle
of San Jacinto were recovered and the entire waterline easement area was cleared for construction. In fact, no unambiguous archeological deposits or artifacts directly attributable to the battle have been located within the park.

Other Research within the Park
Several prehistoric and historic sites have been recorded
within the San Jacinto Battleground State Park boundaries,
only some of which have been assigned unique trinomial
numbers (TARL site files; Hoyt et al. 1998:75-78). These include sites41HR115,41HR316, 41HR317,41HR415, 41HR416,
and 41HR488. The entire park area is designated 41HR277,
and sites within it are typically referred to by combining
these numbers (e.g., 41HR277/316). Ing (1983) reported on
testing at four proposed dump areas within the park, south
of the monument. No significant, intact archeological sediments were recovered in any of the four areas within the
zone of potential adverse impact. Several other sites and
localities within the park have also been tested or examined
by L. Fullen and R. Ralph, among others, but the results
have not been published. Ney land's site 41HR105 has often
been located within the park boundaries (e.g., Foster et al.
1993; Kibler et al. 1996), but there is no evidence to support
this claim in Neyland's original site description. However,
recent TARL auger testing (reported in Chapter 7) suggests
that a small sliver of potentially artifact-bearing intact sediment (possibly equivalent to the 41HR105 shell lens) may be
preserved at the base of the sloping, original levee of B uffalo Bayou within the park and buried by a meter or more of
recent fill.

INVESTIGATIONS ALONG BUFFALOBAYOUNEAR
THESANJACINTOBATILEFIELDSTATEPARK
A second, related survey for CIWA (which was renamed
simply Coastal Water Authority in 1985) was performed in

Chapter 5: Previous Investigations

May 1986 by R. Moore for Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc.
(1986). The survey project area was along two alternative
tunnel alignments, originating from the terminus of the earlier waterline survey (Cartier and Hole 1972) at Valve Station
No. 1 on CWA property southwest of the San Jacinto Battlefield State Park and separated from it by the Houston Light
and Power (HL&P) powerline right-of-way (see Figures 1
and 23). The proposed alignments continued across Buffalo
Bayou near the southwestern comer of the CWA property
before continuing toward Houston. These investigations
included a 100 percent pedestrian survey (complicated by
heavy vegetation) of both alignments as well as "occasional
shovel tests of limited depth" (Heartfield, Price and Greene,
Inc. 1986:9), although neither the number nor locations of
such tests are included in the report. Geotechnical borehole
records from related engineering field tests were also examined, as were TARL site files and records. The latter were
supplemented by an independent compilation of archival
records relating to the undeveloped CWA property and adjacent areas (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986: 16-20;
Wagner 1986).
Wagner's ( 1986) appendix purports to summarize archival and documentary evidence directly related to the CWA
Valve Station No. 1 property. However, while it undoubtedly
contains valuable references and difficult to locate
information%particularly from litigation proceedings, unpublished surveyor notes, and minutes of Harris County road
meetings dating as far back as the mid-nineteenth century%all
of which is arranged chronologically, the entries are presented verbatim with no commentary or analysis. It is also
clear that many entries refer to other properties or to the
surrounding area generally. While this appendix is an important source of primary data, it is not a comprehensive treatment of potential historic occupation or other landuse of the
CWA property.
Moore noted that two sites previously recorded by
Neyland (41HR33 and 41HR121) along the southeastern
(right) bank of Buffalo Bayou shoreline might lie in or near
the proposed waterline alignments (Heartfield, Price and
Greene, Inc. 1986). Based in part on erroneous site locations
on USGS quadrangle maps on file at TARL, along with an
apparent misreading ofNeyland's field records (see below),
Moore surmised that only 41HR33 lay within the proposed
waterline crossing right-of-way and that 41HR121 was outside of the apparently rather narrow project area. Only a
very general undetailed map of the project area is provided
in the 1986 Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. report. However, like McGuff in 1973, Moore was unable to relocate site
41HR33. He, too, was uncertain whether it had been destroyed or was simply obscured by heavy vegetation along
the bankline. While Moore did recognize the potential for
significant shoreline loss during the intervening 30-odd
years, the implications ofthis for the original 1950s site locations are only cursorily considered in the discussion. Despite heavily overgrown vegetation on the upland within

the CWA Valve Station No. 1 property, Moore did re-locate
a distinctive concrete "cylinder" (possibly watertank tower
base) and other historic features noted and photographed
by Neyland as reference points. Curiously, although Moore
correctly noted that 41 HR33 was reported to be downstream
of the concrete cylinder, this would place it well outside of
the more northerly proposed tunnel waterline right-of-way
(Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986: 16). Furthermore, if
Neyland's identifications and notes were correct, then
41HR121 was almost certainly within the proposed impact
zone, not well upstream of it as contended in the survey
report (see also Chapter 7). Site 41HR121 was asserted, not
"found" (see Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986:20), to
lie outside of the project boundaries.
In short, it appears that these incorrect placements were
mainly due to a failure to fully appreciate the significant
landscape alterations which occurred between the late 1950s
when Neyland recorded these sites (including 41HR33 and
41HR121), and the 1970s and 1980s when the McGuff and
Moore surveys were conducted. Extensive erosion of floodplain terrace deposits along Buffalo Bayou resulted in a
bankline several hundred feet farther east of its earlier position. This contributed to the confusion regarding the location of prehistoric sites vis-a-vis the historic brick and concrete footings recorded by Neyland "above" 41HR33. Additional reports of structures 400-500 ft "west" (upstream) of
these historic remains probably refer to the concrete cylinder and associated footings "above" 41HR121. The bankline
and its relationship to the upland margin was clearly altered.
By the 1980s, the locations of the archeological deposits
identified by Neyland as sites41HR33 and41HR121 lay well
out in the Buffalo Bayou channel (see Chapter 7).
During the course of this survey Moore reported two
previously unidentified and potentially significant archeological sites on either side of the Houston Ship Channel.
The first (41HR576) amounted to formal recognition of the
multicomponent historic site on the upland CWA property
containing the structures described above. The other new
site (41HR577) was an apparently intact but deeply buried
and actively eroding prehistoric shell midden on the opposite (northwestern) bank of Buffalo Bayou (see discussion
in Chapter 6). The latter site was included in the original
scope-of-work of the present TARL study while the former
was added during the course of the fieldwork investigations.
Moore's 1986 assessment of 41HR577 was based entirely on visual examination of the cutbank: no subsurface
tests or excavations were performed due to the overlying 3
m of dredged sediment on the site. Despite the interpretation that this was probably an intact, prehistoric midden,
Moore concluded that the proposed pipeline configuration
posed little threat to the site and no mitigation was recommended. Recent reassessment by TARL has determined that
the shell lens and associated artifacts at 41HR577 are in
secondary, redeposited context and that the site has little or

no research potential (see Chapter 6).
Site 41HR576 was identified as having at least two distinct components: one dating to the turn of the century and
the other to mid-twentieth-century dumping of restaurant
debris (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986; TARL site
file). However, the possibility that historic remains related
the Battle of San Jacinto or other significant nineteenthcentury occupations might be shallowly buried on the undeveloped CWA property prompted Moore to recommend a
program of magnetometer survey along the proposed alignments.
The proton magnetometer survey was completed in June
1987 (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1987). Prior to this
survey, the dense vegetation covering the ca. 60-ft-wide
alignment transect was cleared using a bulldozer which
caused shallow but probably insignificant disturbance to
the shallow subsurface. In addition, previous deposition of
an obviously redeposited "mantle of fill" over a portion of
the property was also noted (Heartfield, Price and Greene,
Inc. 1986: 15). Twenty-one magnetic anomalies were identified and investigated by shovel tests between 15 and 80 cm
deep below the modern surface. However, only recent, modern material such as metal pipe and rebar were recovered.
Despite possible questions or uncertainties regarding the
sensitivity of the magnetometer given the size and condition of the target artifacts (cf. Hole 1972:Appendix I), it was
concluded that no significant deposits relating to the Battle
of San Jacinto were to be affected and no further work was
recommended (cf. Chapter 7).
OTIIERSURVEYPROJECfS
A crude-oil-pipeline survey similar to those just described resulted in the discovery of another site included in
the current TARL investigations, 41HR405 (see Figure 1).
The site was originally recorded in May 1978 as an extensive
Rangia and oyster shell midden exposed in profile near the
waterline with prehistoric ceramics and bones (Hudson 1979).
However, the site could not be re-located during a later visit
due to either erosion and continued subsidence (Hudson
1983). Unfortunately the site file was never updated and
41HR405 remained a candidate for further research (Foster
et al. 1993; Kibler et. al. 1996). Recent TARL testing and
examination of historic maps and photographs confirms that
the current emergent landform known as Goat Island is entirely redeposited material (see Chapter 6).
The Houston Archeological Society (HAS) has long
played an active role in sponsoring and supporting archeological research in the Galveston Bay area (see Patterson
1997). Within the project area, the continuing interest and
activity of the HAS is evidenced in the ongoing program of
reconnaissance survey of shoreline areas in Upper Galveston
Bay by HAS members S. Kindall and R. Ebersole, assisted
by M. Marshall. In fact, three of the nine sites designated in
the scope-of-work for the current TARL investigations were

recorded during this survey (see Chapter 6): 41HR680 on
Spilmans Island, 41HR681 on the south shore of Hog Island,
and 41 HR685 on north shore of Atkinson Island, across the
Houston Ship Channel from Morgans Point (see Chapter 6).
EXCAVATIONSINTIIEPEGGYLAKE

DISPOSAL AREA
By far the most extensive investigation of prehistoric
sites in the project area, and among the most comprehensive
single projects on the Upper Texas Coast, was the research
undertaken by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. in the late 1980s
along the western shoreline and adjacent upland areas of
the Peggy Lake Disposal Area (Gadus and Howard 1990).
This inquiry involved survey, machine-aided testing, and
excavations at a number of sites originally recorded by
Worthington in the 1950s or that were newly reported, as
well as the analysis of existing artifact collections and documentary information.
The Peggy Lake investigations have many parallels to
TARL research along the southeastern (right) bank of Buffalo Bayou. In both cases, the circumstances of the original
discovery and excavation of the sites are similar. Furthermore, the two project areas are in close proximity (ca. 3 km)
and have virtually identical topographic settings and geological conditions.
Several of the Peggy Lake shell-bearing sites have horizontally or vertically discrete lenses. Most of the sites are
on the upland margin and many extend onto the valley slope
(Gadus and Howard 1990:49, Table 6). All three thick(> 25
cm) shell middens were found on the upland margin while
thin (< 25 cm thick) middens were found on all four landforms recognized in the Peggy Lake project area: upland
margin, valley slope, valley floor, and lateral valley slope.
However, all but one of the previously recorded sites on the
valley floor (4lHR127) were either completely inundated or
destroyed.
Investigations at Peggy Lake included limited test excavations at two sites (41HR127 and the probable location of
41HR129) and more extensive excavations at three others
(41HR124, 41HR132, and 41HR581). Analysis of new and
existing artifact collections from these sites, as well as those
from 41HR126 and 41HR133, were also performed. The
Worthington site (41HR124) was found to be a thick (up to
1.2 m) shell midden covering an area of ca. 2,300 m 2 along the
valley margin at the mouth of a small side drainage (Gadus
and Howard 1990:71-122). The excavation ofnearly 5.5 m 3 in
four blocks supplemented earlier, more extensive excavations by Worthington. Occupation of this site spanned approximately 3,400 years and its lowermost levels are among
the earliest preceramic midden deposits in the Galveston
Bay. Some later, primary features were discernible including
Feature 3, a possible Clear Lake period cooking or boiling pit
(Gadus and Howard 1990: 119). Less extensive excavations
(ca. 1.6 m 3) at 41HR132 were remarkable for yielding copious

Chapter 5: Previous Investigations

fish remains (Gadus and Howard 1990: 123-140). The site occupies roughly 1,600 m 2 on the upland margin overlooking
the mouth of a drainage emptying into Peggy Lake and is
between 20 and 50 cm thick. It was occupied primarily in the
early Turtle Bay and middle Round Lake periods.
The most extensive excavations in Peggy Lake were at
the Redtail site (41HR581 )%a complex, multicomponent site
comprised of individual shell lenses and later, intrusive human burials (Gadus and Howard 1990:141-185). Extensive
horizontal exposures (including adjacent nonshell areas)
were excavated in order to decipher the complex site structure. Results from this site are particularly relevant to TARL
investigations at 41HR121 and to the analysis of small, discrete sites. Details of the excavation and analysis of this site
is therefore deferred and is taken up again later in this chapter in the section on small-site research.
OTIIERRESEARCHINAND AROUNDTIIE
PROJECT AREA
Numerous investigations of small, circumscribed areas
within the project area, such as dredge disposal locations,
pipelines, and shoreline construction projects have been
conducted also (TARL site files and letter reports on file at
THC in Austin). However, for the most part these are available only as letter reports, site file forms, and unpublished
manuscripts. A few investigations have been published in
the Houston Archeological Society journal or newsletter
(see Patterson 1997). Some sources, such as a manuscript
detailing the excavation and analysis of prehistoric site
41HR73 by a local school group (TARL site file), typify the
highly variable quality and quantity of data available.
Cultural resource management investigations of areas
immediately adjacent to the project area include survey and
testing in the Lost Lake Disposal Area (Fields and Reese
1984), test excavations at prehistoric site 41HR39 (Taylor
1985) on de Zavala Point, and archival and archeological
research at the nearby de Zavala homesite and cemetery
(Brandimarte 1982; Voellinger 1982).
A series of studies of historic resources along the Houston Ship Channel have been conducted by personnel of
Espey, Huston, and Associates, Inc. These investigations
have included (1) intensive archival research, (2) the identification of potential historic site localities, including shipwrecks, (3) field testing and survey of probable site locations, (4) offshore remote sensing, including magnetometer
and sonar surveys, (5) diving programs to "ground truth"
possible submerged shipwrecks, and (6) the assessment of
inundated site localities (Foster et al. 1993; Hoyt 1992, 1993;
Hoyt and Schmidt 1993, 1996; Hoyt et al. 1995, 1996, 1998;
Schmidt and Foster 1997; Schmidt et al. 1995). The program
of site testing reported by Schmidt and Foster (1997) is the
historic counterpart to this TARL study which pertains
mainly to prehistoric resources. In addition to being a primary source of reference data on both historic and prehis-

33

toric sites along the Houston Ship Channel, the report by
Foster et al. ( 1993) is remarkable for its multicolored overlays
of shorelines traced from historic maps and aerial photographs. This series of figures graphically (and dramatically)
illustrate the profound landscape alterations that have occurred over the last century due to erosion, subsidence, and
development.

MANAGEMENfOFCUL'll.JRALRESOURCESINTIIE
PROJECT AREA
Comprehensive listings of all reported prehistoric and
historic cultural resources in the project area, as well as updates on last known condition and probable research potential, are available in two COE-sponsored cultural resource
planning documents (Foster et al. 1993; Kibler et al. 1996).
As part of its ongoing management of, and responsibilities for, cultural resources in the Galveston Bay area, the
COE recently sponsored the development of a comprehensive Historic Preservation Plan for the Houston-Galveston
Navigation Channels (Kibler et al. 1996). In it the authors
identified and developed a number of research topics or
"contexts" for both historic and prehistoric sites to help
guide and focus future archeological investigations. The
individual historic contexts can be broadly grouped under
the main heading Development of Local and Regional Economies on the Houston Ship Channel and in Galveston Bay
between 1800 and 1946. Specific subheadings include:
(a) Natural Resources Exploitation and Development
on the Houston Ship Channel, 1800-1946
(b) Agriculture on the Houston Ship Channel, 1822 to

1946
(c) Commerce and Industry on the Houston Ship Channel, 1740s to 1946
(d) Transportation in and Adjacent to the Houston Ship

(f) Military Activities on the Houston Ship Channel,
1756-1946
(g) Tourism and the Pursuit of Leisure Activities on the
Houston Ship Channel, 1837-1946
Within each subject or context, Kibler and his colleagues
have (1) catalogued the data already collected or readily
available, (2) identified expected property types and locations, and (3) summarized the data needed to address these
research topics and satisfy cultural resource management
requirements. Specific research issues and the significance
of individual historic localities are discussed herein where
appropriate in subsequent chapters. This includes preliminary TARL assessment of documentary and archival evidence pertaining to the Battle of San Jacinto and other potential occupations of the undeveloped CWA Valve Station
No. 1 property southwest of the state park.
In terms of prehistoric cultural resources, Kibler et al.
(1996) echo the discussion of aboriginal adaptive systems
and research domains presented earlier by Howard (Howard
1990a; Howard et al. 1991, see discussion in following section). They reaffirm the appropriateness of a human ecological approach (sensu Butzer 1982) and identify several obstacles to a fuller understanding of aboriginal adaptations.
Familiar data requirements for addressing such research
objectives are reiterated including discrete, undisturbed
components%from either well-stratified middens or small,
thin deposits representing brief periods of
occupation%containing abundant diagnostic artifacts and
materials suitable for radiocarbon dating, particularly paired
charcoal and shell samples. The planning document also
recommends further study of a number of important
nonresource-oriented research issues, including (1) determining the proper procedures and corrections for radiocarbon assays on Rangia shell, (2) the related issue of resolving the accuracy of Aten' s ceramic period chronology in
terms of absolute, sidereal dates, and (3) assessing the va. lidity of Rangia seasonality techniques* [*footnote: An
ongoing research program using large samples collected at
known dates over the period of a year is currently underway
(L. Aten, personal communication 1998).].
Building on the earlier efforts of Espey, Huston, and
Associates (e.g., Foster et al. 1993 and the 1995 draft copy of
Hoyt et al. 1998), Kibler and his colleagues (1996) also compiled a comprehensive list of all prehistoric and historic sites
previously recorded in the project area, including shipwrecks.
Not surprisingly, the last known condition of the vast majority of the 116 inventoried prehistoric archeological sites in
the project area (n= 101 or 87 percent) was listed as disturbed,
destroyed, or inundated (Kibler et al. 1996:6-7). Virtually all
(96 percent or n= 111) of the sites are shell middens with only
a single site listed as an earth midden. Only 10 percent (n=12)
of the prehistoric sites have been the subject of controlled
excavations.

SELECTED RESEARCH ISSUES IN UPPER TEXAS
COASTPREIHSTORICARCHEOLOGY
Nearly all archeological investigations in the Galveston
Bay area have been guided, either implicitly or explicitly,
by an emphasis on both human ecology and geoarcheology.
These complementary perspectives acknowledge the close
connection between the cultural and natural/environmental spheres. Investigating aboriginal adaptive systems and
how they changed through time is central to a cultural
ecological theoretical perspective. Many investigators have
cited Butzer's (1982) explication of human ecology and in
particular his definition of adaptive systems as "the threedimensional intersection defined by social behavior, technology,
and
resource
opportumhes
and
limitations 1.4reflected in subsistence strategies and settlement patterns and that responds and adjusts in relation to
internal processes as well as changes in the human and
nonhuman environment" (Butzer 1982:285-286 and Figure
15.1). Understanding the complex interactions between prehistoric human societies and the natural world (or "ecosystem") of which they were an integral part is particularly
important in a dynamic coastal environment. Such a systemic research orientation is evident in Aten 's (1979, 1983a)
comprehensive treatment and integration of archeological,
ethnohistorical, and geological data; especially his Akokisa
model, various aspects of which have been the focus of
virtually all problem-oriented archeological investigations
over the last two decades.
Howard(1990a:19-39; Howardetal.1991:10-20) has conveniently organized the primary research objectives of Upper Texas Coast prehistoric archeology under six main headings or "research domains": (1) paleoenvironments, (2) chronology, (3) settlement and subsistence systems, (4) technology, (5) population dynamics and paleodemography, and (6)
intraregional and extraregional interaction. Each category
can be further broken down into topics such as group size,
duration of occupation, and range of activities. Of course,
the interrelated nature of a cultural ecological perspective is
evident in the fact that none of these research realms is
wholly independent: data on any specific topic (e.g., seasonality estimates using Rangia shell) can be related to, or
influence, a number of other topics. Only selected aspects
of these research domains are discussed below.
Paleoen vironmental data are vital for reconstructing the
resources and habitats available to prehistoric peoples. Geomorphological analysis of sediments and landforms are a
major source of paleoenvironmental information. For example,
fluviodeltaic deposits, paleosols, and sea level oscillations
have been used to model paleoclimates and the development of estuarial habitats (e.g., Aten 1983a: 104-139; Kibler
et al. 1996:21-50). Another source of paleoenvironmental information is the species composition of invertebrate and
vertebrate remains recovered from archeological sites. Greater

Chapter 5: Previous Investigations

abundances of more-saline-tolerant species such as oyster
(Crassostrea virginica) and Rangiaflexuosa in early contexts at a number of sites in the Galveston Bay area (e.g.,
Ambler 1973; Aten et al. 1976; Gadus and Howard 1990: 114)
suggest local conditions different from the present due to
factors such as an immature barrier island system or sea
level highstands. Fossil pollen is rarely preserved at Upper
Texas Coast archeological sites (cf. Weinstein and Whelan
1987:79-81; Holloway 1987 cited in Howard 1990a:21).
Chronology is a fundamental objective or prerequisite
of any archeological investigation. While the term "culture
history" has often been disparaged in archeological discourse, ordering archeological sites and components in
space (synchronically) and time (diachronically) is necessary in any archeological research. Aten's Galveston Bay
chronology, which is outlined in Chapter 4, is both a tool for
and ongoing subject of investigation. The strength of any
chronology, whether relative or absolute, is dependent on
the quality of evidence supporting it. Temporally diagnostic
artifacts, intact and isolable site components, and accurate
chronometric assays are all important factors. Due to the
paucity oflithic material on the Upper Texas Coast, ceramics
have typically been used for chronology building and consequently the preceramic period is less well known (Aten
1983a:140-162).
The veracity of Aten's ceramic seriation as an absolute
chronology has been the subject of much recent debate,
primarily due to unresolved issues related to the radiocarbon dating of shell, particularly Rangia. Charcoal is rarely
preserved on the Upper Texas Ccoast, and where it does
occur it is generally scattered due at least in part to a ready
mobility within archeological deposits. Shell on the other
hand is much less mobile, but while context is more secure,
interpreting radiocarbon determinations on shell can be complex. A thorough review of the current radiocarbon dating
situation can be found in Howard et al. (1991:11-14) and
Kibler et al. ( 1996:54-62).
Howard's third research domain%settlement and subsistence systems%is also perhaps the most broad and complex. After noting that "adaptive systems are expressed by
the patterned distribution across the landscape of sites representing particular subsistence strategies, group sizes,
spans and seasons of occupation, and ranges of activities"
(Howard 1990a:23), Howard points out that sites in the
Galveston Bay area almost certainly reflect only part of a
seasonal round of settlement and subsistence practices that
also encompassed both inland and shoreline (barrier island)
areas (see also Aten 1979, 1983a; Story 1985, 1990; Patterson
1995, 1996). Complete description and understanding of aboriginal subsistence/settlement adaptations requires a regional perspective.
A wide range of data relate to this research domain,
including seasonality estimates using Rangia shell (Aten
1981; Carlson 1988), fish bones or otoliths (Stringer 1998;
Weinstein and Whelan 1987), and the bones of deer (Ambler

35

1967; but see also Zimmerman 1992). Duration of occupation
and group sizes have been estimated using calculations of
the amount of food represented by bones and shell recovered and their dietary contribution (e.g., Aten 1983b; Dering
and Ayers 1977) or the breadth of taxa exploited (e.g., Ambler
1970; Dillehay 1975). It is clear that investigation of the full
range of activities is critically dependent on understanding
the structure of the entire site, including adjacent off-midden
areas where activities that did not result in shell deposition
may have occurred (e.g., O'Brien 1974; Aten et al. 1976).
Intrasite features such as hearths, pits, postholes, possible
structures, and human burials have been identified in or
near shell middens on the Upper Texas Coast (see review in
Howard 1990a:27-29).
Prehistoric technology, meanwhile, is evidenced by artifacts and related material remains such as manufacturing
debris. Lithic technology was limited somewhat by the scarcity and small size of the raw material available in the immediate Galveston Bay area (Aten 1983a:342-346). As a consequence, high rates of reuse and decreased stylistic variability characterize most Upper Texas Coast lithic assemblages,
limiting their chronological utility. Various bone tools and
other artifacts, such as flutes and beads, have been recovered. Shell artifacts are less abundant than on either the
central or lower Texas coast (cf. Hester 1995; Ricklis 1995).
Both Aten (1983a) and Howard (Howard 1990a:33-36) have
identified technological classes or functionally related
"toolkits," including personal/ritual, subsistence, and tool
manufacturing technologies. Our understanding of prehistoric technologies is severely hindered by the poor preservation of perishable organic materials. Ethnohistorical accounts describe a wide range of tools, such as weirs, baskets, and dugout canoes, that are absent from the archeological record and must be inferred.
Research into the fifth "domain," popula~ion dynamics
and paleodemography, includes not only aspects of group
size and seasonal aggregation but also data from Archaic
and Late Prehistoric cemeteries and bioarcheological analyses (e.g., Aten et al. 1976; Hall 1981; Powell 1988, 1994;
Reinhard et al. 1990). Mortuary traditions and grave goods
can provide important information on territoriality, social
structure, ritual and belief systems, and regional exchange
networks.
Howard's (1990a:37-39) final research category,
Intraregional and Extraregional Interaction, is similarly pervasive and interconnected. Strong evidence for interregional
interactions can be seen in the apparent diffusion of various
ceramic styles (or even technology) from the Lower Mississippi Valley during the earliest ceramic period in the Galveston
Bay area discussed in Chapter 4.
In summation, while these six research categories help
frame or focus archeological inquiry and each has particular
data requirements (Howard 1990a:40, Table 2), the most critical factor necessary for addressing any of them is discrete
archeological assemblages from secure, well-dated contexts.

Study of aboriginal adaptive systems encompasses not only
the age and function of individual sites but also the range
and distribution of sites; the environmental, geological, and
sociocultural milieu; and how all of these factors and relationships changed or persisted through time.

SMALL-SITEARCHEOLOGYONTHEUPPER
TEXAS COAST
The following section briefly introduces what is known
about small shell-bearing archeological sites in and around
the project area. Common characteristics of such sites are
identified and previous investigations are briefly reviewed.
This discussion presages results and recommendations in
later chapters regarding an upslope portion of site 41HR121
discovered by TARL during the 1997 resurvey and subjected to additional testing in the spring of 1998.
Small sites are relatively thin, discrete deposits that represent one or a few short-term occupations. Though quite
common, they have received relatively less research attention than larger shell middens (cf. Aten 1983b:71). Despite
being less conspicuous than larger sites, small sites are amply represented in areal surveys in and around Galveston
Bay. For example, 4 of the 30 shell-bearing sites recorded
along a portion of the Clear Creek drainage (MercadoAllinger et al. 1984:67-114) were reported to be 5 cm or less in
thickness and several others were less than ca. 15 cm thick.
Nevertheless, it is likely true that smaller shell middens are
underrepresented relative to large middens. Especially when
buried, these sites are more difficult to detect and their size
makes them susceptible to rapid erosion. An example is the
upslope extension of 41HR121 discovered and tested during this project (see Chapter 7). There were virtually no surface indications of this site's existence except along one
edge of the site where the sediment overlying a small patch
of shell was scoured away (probably by a hurricane-related
storm surge). A few Rangia shells and prehistoric sherds
were dislodged and slowly moved downslope where they
were found at the surface near the bankline. It was only after
this that a small area of shell exposed in the bankline was
noted 10 to 15 m upstream, obscured by heavy vegetation
and trash. If not for the combination of intensive survey
along the bankline and fortuitous, limited erosion this extant
portion of site 41HR121 would probably never have been relocated.
Although the focus of archeological investigation on
the Upper Texas Coast has traditionally favored large, artifact-rich middens, those smaller sites that have been excavated have received considerable attention. This in part simply reflects the nature of smaller, thinner sites. The potential
of discrete archeological deposits to yield detailed intrasite
spatial patterning requires a horizontal, as opposed to vertical, excavation strategy. Those investigations of small sites
that are recounted below (e.g., Aten 1983b; Gadus and
Howard 1990; Weinstein 1991) have clearly articulated many

of these challenges and have gone a long way toward identifying field and laboratory techniques to maximize data recovery and analytical return.
Despite early characterizations suggesting small sites
were found primarily in terrace and deltaic deposits (Aten
1983a:203-204, 1983b), they have since been found to occur
on upland margins and valley slopes as well as streamside
locations.
The exposure of large horizontal areas at small sites
may be expected to uncover actual living surfaces and reveal spatial relationships between artifacts and features from
a single (or limited number of) occupation events. Larger
sites on the other hand typically represent numerous occupations over a long period of time. The vertical accumulation of diagnostic artifacts and other archeological remains
offers an opportunity to document cultural changes through
time. This temporal dimensionW'long time"3,4is what separates archeology from the other social sciences, with the
arguable exception of historical studies. What archeological
data may lack in terms of detail, it can more than make up for
in temporal perspective. Nonetheless, it is precisely the repetitious reoccupation of the same location over a long period of time that results in a "palimpsest" deposit of countless overlapping and partially disturbed patches of artifacts
and debris, which is virtually impossible to later unravel into
individual constituent events and occupations. Intact, minimally disturbed deposits representing one or a few shortterm occupations have a much greater potential to yield
meaningful intrasite patterning. But at the same time individual small sites cannot reflect the entire range of behaviors and adaptive strategies practiced at any point in time,
nor are they likely to yield representative artifact assemblages (cf. Aten 1983b; Dillehay 1973). For example, seasonal transhumance between the coast and interior, as recorded in early ethnohistorical accounts (see Chapter 4),
requires a regional perspective and the excavation of numerous sites in different habitats. Quite simply, different suites
of data are needed for the various research "domains" outlined above: small sites are most appropriate for some and
larger ones for others.
The earliest effort to systematically examine small shell
middens in the Galveston Bay area was initiated by Aten
(1983b). Specifically, Aten (1983b:2) sought "to reveal more
clearly the habitation debris structural elements which accumulated to form the larger stratified sites." Excavation and
analysis of two small sites (41CH31and41CH170) in the
Trinity River Delta are reported in Aten (1983b) along with
previously unpublished results from Area A at 41 HR85 (see
Aten et al. 1976) where a similar feature was found (see also
Chaffin-Lohse 1978 cited in Weinstein 1991:21). Aten suggested that the basic structural unit of deposition was a
hearth and associated pile of discarded shell. Two such
"hearth-midden couplets" were excavated at 41CH31 and
one at4 l CHl 70. A 50-x-50-cm grid was employed at 41 CH31.
The hearth/refuse pile couplets were found to vary between

Chapter 5: Previous Investigations

6 and 10 m2 with a strong positive correlation between hearth
size and the size of the associated shell deposit. The shell
lenses were estimated to represent between 6 and 12 adult
meals (Aten 1983b:78-83). Aten identified differential patterns of artifact discard within these couplets: lithic flakes
and bone/shell artifacts occurring with the hearths and bone
refuse and ceramics associated with the nearby deposits of
discarded shell.
The Redtail site (41HR581) occupies a small projection
of the upland margin along the western shore of Peggy Lake
(Gadus and Howard 1990: 141-185). Excavation of ca. 65 m2
(roughly 45 percent of the total site area) revealed 12 shell
piles but only 2 hearths. Four later, intrusive burials (representing six individuals) were also found. At least five Ceramic period occupations spanning a period of about 1,300
years were identified, representing "continual through intermittent use of the site by small groups" (Gadus and Howard
1990: 185). Although interpretation was hindered somewhat
by the lack of stratigraphy and the l-m2 grid and 10 cm levels
used%resulting in difficulty linking adjacent artifacts to specific shell piles (Gadus and Howard 1990:182)%the nature
and location of general site activities, as well as group size
and duration of occupation estimates, could be determined.
Unlike the pattern described by Aten (1983b), lithic debitage
and ceramics were found together, around and slightly overlapping the shell lenses. This suggested activity adjacent to
the hearths and associated discard piles. Vertebrate faunal
remains were poorly preserved but were principally comprised of deer and turtle with smaller amounts of bird, alligator, opossum, and bison. The Redtail site is only about 3 km
from site 41HR121 and occupies a roughly similar topographical and stratigraphic setting.
The site that perhaps best approximates the original
structure of 41HR121, however, is the Lido Harbor(41GV82)
site (Bryant et al. 1985; Weinstein 1991). Extensive testing
and excavation at this site revealed over two dozen discrete
shell "pockets" occupying the slope and upland margin adjacent to a large, thick bankline shell midden. Although the

- - - - - - - - -

37

midden was found to be disturbed, and despite what may
have been two hearths within it, Weinstein ( 1991: 185) determined that it most likely "came from the random disposal of
Rangia shells, broken ceramic vessels, lithic debris, etc."
and the initial processing of large quantities of Rangia for
food. Conversely, he concluded that "it is clear that the individual shell pockets represent extremely short-term visits to
the site" (Weinstein 1991:174). The small shell piles also
served as expedient trash disposal areas but were located in
primary habitation areas and were more closely related to
basic household activities.
Both the bankline midden and habitation areas were
occupied repeatedly over a period of about 800 years, from
the end of Turtle Bay period to the middle Old River period.
One of the shell pockets (SP 4) is described in considerable
detail (Weinstein 1991:185-195). The distribution of bone
and artifacts suggested that activities related to food preparation and/or storage and lithic tool maintenance occurred
along the edges of the shell pile while broken sherds and
vertebrate bones were discarded rather haphazardly over
the entire shell area. Weinstein (1991:43-47, 197-206) presents a series of hypotheses against which the excavation
results are tested. These research questions pertain not only
to the Lido Harbor site but are also relevant to small site
studies on the Upper Texas Coast generally and should be
quite useful for framing future investigations.
Other research at small sites in and around Galveston
Bay have not been as extensive. Testing at two sites (41GV14
and 41GV15) along the edge of a small bluff overlooking
Clear Lake revealed a total of eight thin, discontinuous
Rangia lenses accompanied by a small number of artifacts
(Fields and Jackson 1984). Advanced erosion at both sites
limited what inferences could be drawn from the results.
Testing was also conducted at a small site on Taylor Lake
(Fields 1984). Finally, Aten (1983a) describes a number of
small sites in the Galveston Bay and Brazos Delta/West Bay
areas which have been identified but only minimally investigated.

INTRODUCilON

1997) proved to be invaluable, but not exhaustive, sources
of information and are consequently cited extensively in
these sections. They have, however, been supplemented by
additional archival, cartographic, and photographic material
where appropriate. The aim of reviewing and reporting these
historical data is not to exhaustively compile any and all
potentially relevant information. Rather the goal was to gather
specific information on the locations of structures, land-use
practices, and landscape modifications, as well as the character of each locality prior to the significant, and in some
cases catastrophic, surface and shoreline changes in this
century. In some cases the various historical sources are
contradictory or, more commonly, inconclusive. Such instances are noted in the text.
The third section is devoted to more specific and detailed discussion of the modem and reconstructed geomorphology of each locality. Since each of the nine sites originally included in this project were defined as shoreline shell
midden deposits, particular attention is paid to shoreline
reconstruction and to what extent erosion and/or deposition may have affected either the preservation or destruction of late Holocene (or even historical) shorelines. The
primary data sources are aerial photographs and maps, especially those produced this century using a georeference
coordinate system (especially the 1927 North American datum). Combined with a general understanding of the dynamics of coastal geomorphology and the effects of specific
local phenomena such as subsidence related to intensive
geofluid extraction, these data illustrate the rate and extent
of landscape change in the project area. Multiple views of
individual maps are reproduced in order to describe shoreline changes and alterations through time. The dramatic effects of subsidence and erosion on the one hand, and deposition of dredged sediments on the other hand, have resulted in many cases in the reuse or even misidentification
of place names for what are very different landforms. For
each locality, at least three individual maps or aerial photographs have been combined into a single projection show-

Results of the 1997 TARL survey from Morgans Point
to the lower reaches of Buffalo Bayou are reported in this
chapter. This includes the investigation of sites 41HR685
(Atkinson Island), 41HR681 (Hog Island), 41HR680 (Spilmans
Island), 41HR405 (Goat Island), and 41HR577 on the north
shore of Buffalo Bayou just upstream from where it joins
Carpenters Bayou (see Figure 1). The four sites defined by
Neyland in the 1950s (41HR33, 41HR104, 41HR105, and
4 lHRl 21) and the multicomponent historic site (41HR576)
that partially overlies what remains of 41HR121 are treated
separately in the following chapter. The results of all field
and laboratory investigations of these five sites are fully
contained in this chapter, except where noted or cross referenced to the appendixes.
This chapter opens with a briefreview of the objectives
and methodology employed during the course of the TARL
survey conducted in the summer of 1997. Following this is a
detailed discussion of the five site localities investigated.
Each site is treated separately, beginning at the southern
end of the project area at Morgans Point (41HR685) and
continuing sequentially (or progressively) upchannel in order. All sections follow the same general outline, as follows.
An Overview/Management Summary section begins
each site section. This summarizes the history, geomorphology, and archeological survey results for each locality and,
in most cases, presages TARL's recommendations for or
against additional archival and/or archeological research
made in the final chapter of this study.
Following the Management Summary is a section on
previous investigations at each site. Included are a discussion of the original definition and assessment of each site as
well as a brief overview of historical occupations and their
potential significance at or near each of the five localities.
Recent compilations, assessments, and field investigations
of historical data and resources in the project area (including Hoyt et al. 1998; Kibler et al. 1996; Schmidt and Foster

ing historical shoreline changes. Each projection was
georectified using procedures outlined in Chapter 2 in order
to reduce or eliminate distorting effects such as parallax.
These maps supplement historical shoreline overlay maps
presented by Foster et al. ( 1993) and Hoyt et al. ( 1998) which,
while not georectified, include a larger number of individual
shorelines. These map overlay series are complementary and
demonstrate largely the same results. The main difference is
that the objective in the present report was to target specific
localities in a quantitative manner.
The fourth section of each site discussion is the report
of all TARL investigations conducted during the 1997 resurvey, including both surface examinations and subsurface
testing, if any. A description of the overall character and
setting of each site is included. All prehistoric and historic
artifacts recovered or noted, and their provenience, are discussed along with an assessment of their potential significance. Results of the TARL survey are then integrated with
the results and interpretations presented in the earlier sections and a comprehensive model of historical changes and
disturbances at each site is developed. This reconstructed
geomorphology, in combination with the archeological results, is used to determine the likelihood that each site, as
originally defined, was or was not a valid, intact archeological deposit; and in the case of the former, whether the site
may still survive above or below the modern water line. In
addition, the potential for each locality to yield significant
historic or prehistoric archeological data is assessed.

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS
This section details the methods used during the survey and initial site testing phases of TARL fieldwork. The
methods and objectives of the advanced testing phase at
41HR121 are presented separately in Chapter 7, which discusses the results of that testing.
Access to three site localities (41HR405 [Goat Island],
41 HR681 [Hog Island], and 41HR685 [Atkinson Island]) was
possible only by boat. The remaining sites (including
Spilmans Island) were accessible by vehicle.
Since five of the nine sites were defined and recorded in
the last 20 years, and since most were discovered through
simple reconnaissance, TARL reassessment of each locality
typically also began with a 100 percent surface pedestrian
survey. All prehistoric artifacts were collected, but historic
artifacts on the surface were not collected unless they were
clearly diagnostic or otherwise informative. In all cases, surface finds were recorded in the notes along with appropriate
provenience information.
The primary objective of the TARL fieldwork was to
relocate and test previously defined prehistoric archeological sites that were considered to be the best candidates for
having significant intact deposits and demonstrable research
potential. These sites were selected from lists of sites in two
COE-sponsored planning documents (Foster et al. 1993;
Kibler et. al. 1996). Consequently, a significant component

of the TARL testing required obtaining subsurface stratigraphic information.
Following recommendations proposed in the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) guidelines for research (Fields
et al. 1996), a distinction was made in this project between
shovel probes and shovel tests. A shovel probe may or may
not be dug in 20-cm levels and the dirt is not necessarily
screened but rather is closely examined for artifacts, sediment type, and natural inclusions. The primary purpose of a
shovel probe is to locate subsurface sites and examine sediments. In contrast, a shovel test is excavated in discrete
levels not to exceed 20 cm in maximum depth, and all sediment (or at least a portion) from each level is screened. Shovel
tests are used primarily when a site has been located, and
the purpose of further testing is to discern details of cultural
and natural stratigraphy or to determine the character and/
or extent of specific site deposits. What was considered a
shovel probe as defined above was occasionally modified in
order to address particular field conditions or proximate questions. For example, in some cases shovel probes were excavated in 20-cm levels but not screened, while in other cases
the sediments were screened but not formally dug in discrete arbitrary levels. In such cases, these differences are
noted in the text where appropriate. The term "shovel test"
is reserved for only those instances where all criteria as
outlined in the CTA guidelines have been met. In addition,
CTA recommendations in terms of probe/test coverage, frequency, and spacing were followed as much as possible and
in most cases were exceeded.
A Trimble ProXR Global Positioning System (GPS) unit
was employed to record the positions and locations of individual tests and important/significant landmarks at each site
as well as to help re-locate specific locations. Within individual site areas, when a sufficient density of tests were to
be made, a surveyor's transit was used to map the location
and elevation of each test as well. The transit often proved
to be more satisfactory because of the inability of the GPS
system to accurately determine elevation, although the proximity of navigational beacons associated with shipping and
ship traffic enabled the unit to achieve horizontal accuracy
of less than 1 m in real time without the necessity of
postprocessing. When using the transit, temporary base
elevations of 100.00 m were made at each locality and were
tied into general tidal range (especially mean low tide) as far
as could be determined in the field. The lack of nearby
georectified datums is due to the dynamic character of the
area and the recent subsidence or low-intensity land use at
several of these locations.
In cases where heavy brush or thickets obscured visibility and access, such as during the early testing at 41HR121,
a handheld compass and 30-m tape were used to lay out grid
transects and intervals. On open ground, distances were
commonly paced off. Shovel and auger probes and tests
(and the transects, when necessary) were assigned a number and/or letter, typically in the order they were excavated
or laid out.

Chapter 6: Investigations at 4/HR405, 4/HR577, 4/HR680, 41HR681, and 4/HR685

Auger probes were used extensively for a couple of
reasons. First, they were necessary because of the difficulty
of digging through thick clays at depths greater than about
1 m; but second and more importantly, augers were employed
when approaching or penetrating the water table, where the
saturated sediments became very unstable, heavy, and difficult to remove in any controlled manner. Initially, a 3-inchdiameter bucket auger was used exclusively but later, a wider
6- to 8-inch tapered bucket auger was used as well. The
latter had an extension that reached maximum depths of between 1.5 and 2.0 m, depending on conditions. Previously,
the smaller bucket had only a fixed single extension bar that
permitted only about 1-m depth access.
Augering was frequently combined with shovel probing. When it became difficult or impossible to dig deeper
using the picks and variety of shovels on hand, the auger
was employed to access deeper sediments. In this way, we
were frequently able to reach depths well in excess of 1 m
and occasionally as much as 2 m.
Auger probes were used at the surface only where the
water table was known to be very near the surface or where
nearby tests had satisfied the question of the presence and
nature of archeological material. In these cases, the primary
aim of excavating these auger probes was to supplement the
existing stratigraphic information from nearby shovel probes
and tests rather than as a primary investigative technique.
Sediments from the auger bits were rarely screened but were
always carefully examined for evidence of cultural materials;
sediment type, color, and other characteristics were always
described as were any natural inclusions.
In most cases, the placement and density of subsurface
tests was based on previous information about the probable
location of historic features, tracing out or following out
negative tests in some patterned way to reliably infer the
preservation and/or stratigraphy at a particular locality. In
many cases, the relationship of the modern landform or sediments to an earlier historic or prehistoric surface was in doubt
due to some combination of subsidence, burial by dredge
material, erosion, or other natural or cultural impacts. For
these localities a representative area in which the likelihood
of intact deposits was deemed high was selected and multiple tests were dug in regular intervals perpendicular to the
shoreline in order to define the relationships between these Â·
sediments and surfaces.
All exposed cutbanks were examined for stratigraphic
information but were rarely drawn in detail. Occasionally
small samples of sediment were collected for magnetic susceptibility analyses during the course of survey. It was anticipated that samples would assist in the interpretation of
intact stratigraphic sections with evidence of prehistoric archeological components. Unfortunately, such deposits were
found only at 41HR121, and the methodology employed at
that time was slightly different. The few sampled columns
collected were clearly through dredge material and redeposited sediments. The sample measurement reflect this and are

41

therefore not presented in this report as they do not add to
the interpretations or conclusions. Approximately 8 cc of
unoriented sediment was collected in a sealed cube made of
nonmagnetic plastic. Once collected, these small cubes were
transported to the laboratory where they were measured in a
Bartington MS2 Susceptibility Meter with a desktop attachment. A greater effort in taking magnetic susceptibility readings was made during the additional testing phase at 41HR121
(see Chapter 7).
INVES11GATIONS
41HR685
Overview/Management Summary
Site 41HR685 was reported in 1990 as part of a survey of
cultural resources in Upper Galveston Bay by members of
the Houston Archeological Society (TARL site file). It was
described as a prehistoric shell midden on the north shore of
Atkinson Island, across the Cedar Bayou Ship Channel from
Hog Island, and bordered on the west by the main Houston
Ship Channel where it flows past Morgans Point and enters
Galveston Bay (see Figure 1). In addition to prehistoric artifacts, 41HR685 was reported to have evidence of nineteenthand early-twentieth-century historic occupations. Evidence
for historic occupations of the island include a ca. 1870s-era
shipyard in the immediate 41 HR685 site area as well as small,
nearby buildings mapped early this century. In addition, remains of the New Washington townsite (established in 1834
but burned by the Mexican Army in 1836 just prior to the
Battle of San Jacinto) and oflateroccupations, and improvements made by James Morgan may exist on a nearby bluff
on the opposite side of the Houston Ship Channel, well west
of 41 HR685. Immediately across the channel is believed to
be a portion of the early-twentieth-century townsite of Morgans Point. There is no evidence for occupation or commercial development of Atkinson Island since at least 1930. The
only apparent use of the island since that time has been the
disposal of dredged sediments and occasional casual use
(e.g., rabbit hunting).
Atkinson Island was formed in the mid 1870s by the
excavation of a canal through Morgan's Point or peninsula
in order to bypass Clopper's Bar, a significant barrier to navigation. The gap between the cutoff island and Morgans
Point has widened considerably since that time through both
dredging of the Houston Ship Channel and lateral erosion
caused by passing ships. A relative abundance of cartographic information on Morgans Point and surrounding areas is available from the latter half of the nineteenth century.
A review of this evidence, as well as twentieth-century maps
and aerial photographs, indicated some potential for intact
historic or prehistoric deposits at 41HR685. The lack of modern development and the absence of dredged sediment disposal in the immediate site area were additional factors suggesting an increased chance of site preservation. However,
the effects of severe local subsidence (due in large part to

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

42

rapid development of the nearby Goose Creek oil field after
World War I) along with erosion and extensive, recent reworking of the north shore beach deposits suggested that
intact surfaces and deposits were probably at or below the
water line. Only small portions, if any, of the original prehistoric or historic site areas would remain accessible. Shoreline changes have been dramatic, even within the last 10 or
15 years. The overall configuration of the sand and shell
beach in 1997 is very different from that in 1982.
The site was re-located during the 1997 TARLresurvey
and a significant amount of fieldwork was undertaken to
evaluate the site and its depositional history. These investigations included pedestrian survey and the excavation of
nearly two dozen shovel and auger tests as well as a small,
hand-dug trench. Although both prehistoric and historic
artifacts were recovered, all came from disturbed or secondary contexts. Analysis of the surface and subsurface deposits, combined with the cartographic and aerial photographic
evidence, clearly indicate that any intact cultural deposits
are now up to 1 m below the water line. Continued erosion
and reworking of these and later sediments makes it unlikely
that archeologically intact and significant deposits exist, or
are reasonably accessible. The short-lived historic occupations and land use that can be documented in the site area
now lie, for the most part, offshore within current shipping
lanes. In addition, prior to inundation, the structures and
other improvements would have been subject to the full
force of hurricanes and floods on this low landform.
The locality originally defined as 41HR685 is a natural
deposit of sand and shell, sorted by wave action and containing eroded and redeposited artifacts. Therefore, it has
little or no apparent research potential. All artifacts recovered are from secondary and disturbed contexts and intact
deposits, if they exist are now well below sea level. However,
during the course of the TARL investigations, references to
occupations, historic events, and/or land use of the 41HR685
area and Morgans Point (e.g., Muir 1958:13-17; Roemer
1935:53-62) were encountered that supplement those discussed in recent historical compendia of the project area
(Hoyt et al. 1998; Kibleretal.1996; Schmidt and Foster 1997).
Previous Investigations and Historical Overview
Site 41HR685 was reported as part of a cultural resources
survey of the Upper Galveston Bay area conducted in 1990
by members of Houston Archeological Society. The objective of this comprehensive survey was to document archeological sites along shorelines in the Upper Galveston Bay
which then, as now, were potentially threatened by diverse
natural and human destructive forces. Located along the
northern shore of Atkinson Island (see Figure 1), 41HR685
was reported to be a prehistoric shell midden roughly 2,000
ft (ca. 600m) long, 75 ft (ca. 22.5 m) wide, and 1 m thick. In
addition, the site was reported to have an historic component predating 1911 (TARL site file). Artifacts including un-

decorated Goose Creek sherds and low-fired bricks believed
to have been made nearby at Cedar Bayou were recovered.
The collected sherds were reportedly curated at the Bay
Area Museum in Seabrook, Texas (TARL site file), but apparently this information was incorrect (C. Ebersole, personal communication 1998), and the artifacts could not be
re-located for analysis. It was estimated at that time that 50
percent of the site remained intact. Subsidence and wave
erosion were identified as significant factors affecting the
past, present, and future preservation of the site.
Evidence of historical developments and events in and
around the 41HR685 area (Morgans Point and Atkinson Island) have been compiled by Espey, Huston, and Associates, Inc. and are reported in a number of publications. The
historical contexts have been outlined in the comprehensive
historic preservation plan for the project area (Kibler et al.
1996). The following historical overview is partly derived
from these reports, which have been supplemented where
indicated by additional sources. The focus in all cases is on
evaluating the types and locations of historical remains and
whether or not they may have been preserved. It should
also be noted that the various sources or referenced materials contradict each other in terms of dates of specific events
or are more or less ambiguous or imprecise. For example, the
multiple entries in The New Handbook o/Texas (Tyler et al.
1996), and other syntheses of historical information (e.g.,
Alperin 1977; Sibley 1968) pertaining to the Morgans Point
area and its occupants are written by several different authors, each of whom often cite different sources and reach
different conclusions. Where such contradictions or inaccuracies cannot be resolved by cross-referencing an independent source, they are noted in the text.
Morgans Point (also known at various times as Rightor's
Point, Hunter's Point, and Clopper's Point) was originally a
peninsula oflow-lying land formed by clockwise, longshore
drift where the San Jacinto River emptied into Upper
Galveston Bay (see Figure 1). An 1851 U.S. Coast Survey
map (Figure 2) is the earliest detailed depiction of Morgans
Point, its surroundings, and developments. It may therefore
serve as a kind of base map of the natural topography and
landscape of the peninsula and the lower reaches of the
original (historic) course of the San Jacinto River and Bay.
As the peninsula grew eastward from the ridge of higher
ground labeled "Morgan's Point" on Figure 2, it gradually
shunted the course of the San Jacinto River eastward so
that eventually, Morgans Point became the right (south)
bank of the San Jacinto River. After flowing southward past
Spilmans and Hog Islands, the river turned eastward and
then south, just past the point, before entering Upper
Galveston Bay.
The longshore drift that produced this peninsula, combined with the point-bar created by the river as it made this
final southward turn, resulted in the development and continual replenishment of a shifting sand bar, eventually known
as Clopper's Bar. This bar, along with Red Fish Reeffarther

south in Galveston Bay, was very early identified as major
obstacles to development of shipping and trade (Alperin
1977:93; Hoyt et al. 1998:29-32; Sibley 1968:51). Due to the
interest in removing or bypassing this barrier to commercial
transportation, a relatively large number of maps and charts
were made of the immediate area around Morgan's Point in
the latter half of the nineteenth century. These maps are
invaluable sources of information for understanding the
evolution and transformation of the Morgans Point/
Atkinson Island (41 HR685) area.
Morgans Point peninsula was first settled in 1822 by
Nicholas Rightor (a surveyor for Stephen F. Austin [Loo scan
1914:196]), reportedly after his small boat was wrecked (Glass
1996), perhaps on what later came to be known as Clapper's
Bar. Rightor's residence was probably at the far eastern end
of the peninsula (Hoyt et al. 1998:56), probably at ornear the
location labeled "Clapper's" on Figure 2. Rightor's home
may also be depicted on an earlier (1828), poorly detailed
map of the San Jacinto/Buffalo Bayou area (Hoyt et al.
1998:56). After living on the point between March and December 1822 (Glass 1996), Rightor may have sold the point
(Hazlewood 1996) to Johnson Calhoun Hunter (one of
Stephen Austin's Old Three-Hundred) who arrived with his
family in April 1822 (Hunter 1966:4). Hunter received a land
grant, including the point and surrounding area, on August
10, 1824 (Tyler et al. 1996). Hunter apparently did not occupy
the peninsula itself, instead building his home on the western shore of San Jacinto Bay farther upstream. A colorful
and informative account of these pioneering occupations of
the San Jacinto Bay/Morgans Point area (as well as the San
Jacinto Campaign of 1836, see Chapter 7) was written by
Johnson Hunter's son, Robert Hancock Hunter, in 1860
(Hunter 1966). It is an invaluable description of the early
Euroamerican settlement of the area and of the hostile relationships between the settlers and native populations. The
following brief excerpt of Hunter's narrative is accompanied
by editorial comments by the author.
When we left [Galveston], we took 2 fameleys
a bord ofus, & sailed up to San Jacinto bay, landed
at what is now cald new Washington, the 7 day of
April 1822 ...
The Tankaway Indians, and Cronks, ware hostile and troubled the whites. [Presumably Hunter is
referring to the Tonkawa and Karankawa. However,
the native occupants of this part of Galveston Bay
appear to have been the Akokisa (see Aten 1983a).
The terms as used by Hunter may reflect the consolidation of fragmented native populations (due
to disease or warfare), the displacement of native
groups from their aboriginal territories, or may simply be used as generic terms for the native populations.] Tua lernt how to give a signal, by putting up
a white flag. There was two fameleys come up from
Glaveston in two small boats. The Cronks put a
white flag on the beach at little seder [Cedar] Bayou

Morgans Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

[south of Morgans Point on the northwestern shore
of Upper Galveston Bay] & the boats went a shore.
The Cronks run on them & kild them, 3 men, 2
wimmen & 4 or 5 children. One man got a way, by
jumping out in to the bay swiming and wading about
4 or 5 miles a cross to the point [Morgans], and
came a round to Pa[']s. Pa & a man by the name of
Fowler, got in thare boats & collected some 10 or 15
men, & went down to little seder Bayou that night,
& found the Indians, a kooking the peoples hands
& feet & eating & dancing. The whites lay close in
the grass by them untill day light, & fiard in to
them, & kild 15 or 20 of them, & the balance left.
Tua never bothered us any more ...
It was prairie a cross from our house, south to
Galveston Bay ... Wheare we lived we could see the
indians fires over on the beach at little seder
bayou ...
Pa ust to traid up the San Jancinto river with
the Coshatta indians, would buy deer skins bare
skins coon skins & all kinde & bares oil. I all ways
went with him.
The Coushatta Indians began moving into Texas, from
Louisiana by the 1780's and by 1830, about 600 Coushatta
lived in three communities along the Trinity River (Martin
19%).
In August 1882, Johnson Hunter went to San Antonio
and later Louisiana for supplies:
Now all this time Mother & us children remained on San Jacinto Bay, what is now cald New
Washington, surrounded by the Tonks and
Tonkaway Indians, Mother & 5 children. I was the
oldest [about 9 years old]. We could see 25 or 30
indians over on the beach south of us, on little
Seder Bayou 7 or 8 miles from us, & could see them
for weeks at a time [Hunter 1966:4-7].
Johnson Calhoun Hunter then sold the peninsula to
Nicholas Clopper sometime between 1826 and 1829, although
most likely at the latter date (Connor 1996; Hoyt et al. 1998:55).
Note that Sibley (1968: 17) sets the date of this transaction as
December, 1826, but Robert Hancock Hunter, wrote in 1860
that they lived there 7 years, beginning in April 1822 (Hunter
1966:4-8). He further specifies that "Father sold his land thare
to two men, one by the name of Cloper, and the other by the
name of Louis. He got25 cents per acre" (Hunter 1966:8).
Clopper, along with three of his sons, hoped to open
and develop a trade route to the Brazos River using Buffalo
Bayou and the Morgans Point (then Hunter's Point) peninsula as a transshiping point (Sibley 1968:17). However,
Clopper encountered personal and financial difficulties and
the peninsula remained undeveloped. It does not appear
that any significant improvements were made during the
period of Clapper's ownership. He may have simply occu-

pied the Rightor homestead, as suggested by the 1851 uses
map (see Figure 2), although by the time that map was made
Clopper had apparently long since left the area after selling
all or part of the peninsula to James Morgan in the mid 1830s
(see below). Nicholas Clopper died in December 1841 (Sibley
19%).
During the 1820s, the only significant development on
the peninsula appears to have been the homestead established by Rightor at the far end of the peninsula. This structure may also have been occupied by Henry K. Lewis in 1830
(during the period of Clopper's ownership), but it was apparently abandoned by April 1833 (Garrison 1900:85-86) when
it was used by Mrs. Dilue Harris and other passengers aboard
Captain James Spillman's schooner which had run aground
on Clopper's Bar. It appears that only minimal developments
were made to the peninsula during this early period of occupation.
That changed, however, with the arrival of James Morgan who bought 1,600 acres from Clopper in December of
1834(Hazlewood1996; Hoyt et al. 1998:57). Morgan, acting
as an agent for the New Washington Association, an investment and development group whose principals included
Lorenzo de Zavala (Brunson and Muir 1996; Henson 1996),
established and developed the town of New Washington
over the next 16 months. The town eventually grew to include warehouses, wharves, and associated buildings by
March 1836, when Morgan was appointed as commandant
of Galveston Island during the Texas Revolution (Brunson
and Muir 1996). Shortly thereafter, an advance force of the
Mexican Army, under the command of Col. Juan N. Almonte,
nearly captured David G. Burnet, President of the ad interim
Texas government, and others in his party at New Washington (Sibley 1968:27). Nevertheless, the Mexican forces occupied the settlement on April 19 and 20, 1836 and confiscated much-needed provisions from its storehouses
(Castaneda 1928:75, 353; Sibley 1968:27-28). They burned
the fledgling town before proceeding to their decisive defeat on the plains of San Jacinto, about 12 miles upstream.
Following the war, James Morgan returned to the point
with the intention of rebuilding New Washington and laying
out a second townsite, Crockett, but he was largely unsuccessful (Gray 1965: 153; Hoyt et al. 1998:57). He did build a
plantation named Orange Grove, his private residence
(Brunson and Muir 1996; Hoyt et al. 1998:57-58), on the bluff
overlooking San Jacinto Bay. This residence and the family's
Orange Grove cemetery probably correspond to the cleared
areas on the bluff in Figure 2 (cf. Hoyt et al. 1998:57-58).
Although Col. Morgan was not able to resurrect New Washington, he became a very successful cattleman and farmer,
and his home developed into the "social center of eastern
Harris County" (Fletcher 1950:26). James Morgan died in
March 1866 and is buried in Orange Grove Cemetery (Brunson
and Muir 1996).
By December 1839 when Harris County was officially
created, the southern margin of San Jacinto Bay was largely

45

occupied, with "James Morgan at New Washington (and)
Nicholas Clopper at Highland Cottage" (Fletcher 1950:8).
The precise location of Highland Cottage is not known, but
it seems unlikely that it refers to the small Rightor/Lewis
homestead labeled "Clopper's" on Figure 2.
Likewise, the precise location of New Washington in
somewhat ambiguous. A plat ofland surveys---commenced
by Stephen F. Austin in 1833 and completed in 1837 but not
entered on file at the General Land Office until 1912 (Hoyt et
al. 1998:57Hepicts New Washington as spanning both
sides of the later channel cut through the lower portion of
the peninsula, east of the bluff. However, eyewitness accounts of visits to Morgan in the years following the Texas
Revolution are particularly enlightening in terms of understanding the landscape, the relative locations of structures
and improved areas, and the uses and character of the land.
Two accounts in particular are instructive. The first is an
anonymous account of a visit to Morgans Point on March
24-25, 1837(Muir1958:11-19), and the otheris a somewhat
more detailed report by Ferdinand Von Roemer of his experiences there in January 1846 (Roemer 1935 :53-62; Tyler et al.
1996). After leaving Galveston, the anonymous traveler recounts that
overcoming all difficulties, we passed Clopper's
Bar (another formidable obstacle to the navigation
of these waters ... [we] landed at twelve o'clock at
night a short distance below New Washington
(Muir 1958:13) .... Forthe firstquarterofamile we
found great difficulty in getting through the high
grass and weeds. The noise we made frightened
the alligators in our way, and we could hear them
occasionally, a few yards in advance of us, drop
like heavy logs into the water.
We now came to New Washington, situated
on a handsome eminence and surrounded by a
dense forest of various kinds of timber.... Before
the Revolution, New Washington contained some
respectable buildings, but their ashes showed that
Santa Anna had been here .... Groping our way
through the timber, over a tolerable marked road,
we came to a log cabin [Morgan's], which we entered [Muir 1958:13-14].
Nearly 10 years later, Roemer (1935:55) visited New
Washington at Morgan's invitation:
The house of Mr. Morgan lies on the shore of
the bay which rises here to an elevation of twenty
to twenty-five feet. It is an unornamented, onestory structure of the architectural type common in
this part of the South ... Back of the house is a dense,
virgin forest.. .. Half hidden among the trees stood
a number oflog cabins constructed of roughly hewn
logs, evidently the homes of slaves belonging to
the plantation. On the opposite side extended a
low, narrow peninsula covered with tall grass on

46

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

which several hundred head of cattle, divided into
numerous groups, were grazing ... .In answer to my
question how many head of cattle he owned, my
host replied that he thought he had about one thousand.
Roemer (1935:62) later reiterates that "Mr. Morgan's
house lies about twenty-five feet above the level of the sea.
The land toward the interior is of equal height and entirely
level, while that toward Galveston (the shores of the bay) is
scarcely two to four feet high."
He also reported that
Our affable host [Mr. Morgan] informed us in
the course of the conversation that a much larger
house and two store buildings filled with merchandise, once stood where today his dwelling stands.
These buildings were plundered and destroyed in
1836 when Santa Anna ... had his headquarters here
immediately preceding the Battle of San Jacinto
[Roemer 1935:59].
Finally, Roemer (1935:62) notes:
The surface soil is composed of humus, one to
two feet in depth. The subsoil is a red and black
clay. In the latter are found shells of the bivalve
(Gnathodon cuneatus Gray) [i.e., Rangia cuneata]
scattered about singly. On the shores of the bay,
but several feet above the present level, one can
see mounds, a fathom deep, composed principally
of shells of this mussel. This same mussel lives
today in the waters of the bay, but not in the narrow inlet which in reality is to be considered the
mouth of the San Jacinto and on whose shores the
accumulation of shells is found. It is only found
where the bay enlarges itself and the water becomes
brackish through a mixture of fresh and salt water.
The two accounts are noteworthy principally for the
information regarding the location of New Washington, Orange Grove, and other associated buildings on the bluff, the
number of storehouses, and also for their description of the
character and use of the lower-lying land on the peninsula.
The reports may be somewhat contradictory in that the
anonymous account implies some distance between the ruins of New Washington and Morgan's house while Roemer
suggests that they were at the same location. However, it is
not clear that both reports are referring to the same house.
Neither are they precise in terms of distances or the size of
the referenced areas. Rather, one can only reasonably infer
that the main portion of New Washington (excepting perhaps only the wharves) was situated on the bluff itself, as
was Orange Grove (see Figure 2).
Both accounts also clearly indicate that the peninsula
was originally a low-lying area, less than 5 ft high and covered with grass. Roemer reports it was used for grazing.

Being topographically low, the peninsula was almost certainly subject to periodic inundation due to flooding and
storms and presumably retained a somewhat marshy character. This is supported by a 1922 Harris County soil survey
(Geib et al. 1928) in which all of the land below the bluff in the
immediate area of Morgans Point/Atkinson Island was
mapped as Harris clay, except for small areas of madeland
and tidal marsh along the shoreline fringes. Harris clay soils
are described as "little more than semideveloped soils, and
are more or less marshy, lying on the higher marginal areas
of the tidal marshes where drainage is better than on tidalmarsh areas" (Geib et al. 1928: 1921). Given the degree of
local subsidence and erosion that has taken place over the
last 80 years (see below), it appears unlikely that these low,
historically documented surfaces and landforms would now
remain above water. The shell mounds along the shoreline
described by Roemer may be either natural beach accumulations or archeological deposits. However, it must be noted
that the shorelines in the vicinity of Morgans Point have
been extensively altered in the 150 years since Roemer's
visit (see following section on reconstructed shorelines).
The growth of commerce among the growing communities between Galveston and Houston continued to be impeded by Clapper's Bar, as well as Redfish Reef farther south
in the open bay (Sibley 1968:51). Finally, on April 7, 1857 the
state engineer awarded the first contract to dredge Clopper' s
Bar to David Bradbury (Sibley 1968:68). The shifting sandbar, however, quickly reformed, thus rendering regular maintenance or dredging a necessity. Following the Civil War,
incorporation of the Houston Direct Navigation Company
in 1866 (Reed 1996), unpopular wharfage policies in
Galveston, and efforts by the City of Houston to spur economic development and obtain federal port of entry status
all continued to exert pressure for navigational improvements
(Alperin 1977:95; Sibley 1968:82-93). In response, the Buffalo Bayou Ship Channel Company was chartered in 1869
and undertook the dredging of a channel across Morgans
Point, thereby bypassing the unstable Clapper's Bar (Farrar
1926; Sibley 1968:93; Sibley 1996).
At about the same time, the River and Harbors Act of
1870 (Alperin 1997:95) prompted the first federal survey,
mapping, and assessment of the proposed ship channel.
This survey in December 1870 and January 1871 produced a
map of the current project area, including numerous bathymetric cross-sections (Figure 3). The rapidity with which the
map was made is reflected in an imprecise plan view. Emphasis instead appears to have been on the channel cross-sections and depths. Nevertheless, it is clear by this time that
the BBSCC's effort to dredge a canal through Morgans peninsula was well underway. While it is not specified where the
bluff is in relation to the channel cut, a course east of the
bluff, across the lower terrace, was certainly selected. The
bluff line is clearly visible today on the western side of the
ship channel.
A financial panic in 1873 halted the Buffalo Bayou Ship

Channel Company's activities (Sibley 1968:97). However,
partly in response to unfavorable changes in wharfage
charges at Galveston and with an eye toward further developing his extensive shipping and railroad interests, Com}llodore Charles Morgan (no relation to James), based in
Brashear City (later Morgan City), Louisiana, took over its
operations in July 1874 and agreed to complete the channel
(Baughman 1996). Commodore Morgan had just completed
dredging a channel between the Atchafalaya River and the
Gulf of Mexico. Morgan therefore put his idle equipment
and dredging crews to work on completing the channel
through Morgans Point and the shallow-bottomed bay just
south of it while at the same time developing wharfage and
transshipment facilities at Clinton across from the junction
of Sims and Buffalo Bayous. The dredging operations at
Morgans Point were placed under the supervision of Capt.
John J. Atkinson (Sibley 1968 :99), for whom the cut-off island was laternamed. Stansbury (quoted in Sibley 1968:99100) describes the scale of this undertaking in 1875:
eight dredges, two derricks, a half dozen tugs
and any number of scows, barges, etc. are engaged
night and day in cleaning out the channel to Buffalo Bayou. The bay at night for miles is one blaze
of light, and the air is burthened with the din of
machinery. Hundreds of men find employment. ..
The channel was completed inApril 1876, after which
Morgan began to charge a toll for use of this bypass of
Clapper's Bar. This, of course, proved to be quite unpopular
and, in light of the federal government's efforts to improve
the channel across Red Fish Bar and following Commodore
Morgan's death in 1878, the channel was sold and transferred to the U.S. government in 1892 (Sibley 1968: 108-110).
Returning to the 1870-1871 Corps ofEngineers map (see
Figure 3), a shipyard is also indicated east of the channel
cut. No individual buildings or other details are indicated
but the location of this shipyard is clearly east of the channel cut. A subsequent Corps of Engineers survey in 1877
(following the completion of Charies Morgan's canal cut
through the peninsula), yielded a map that provides greater
detail regarding the number and location of structures presumably associated with this shipyard (Figure 4). Three
structures front the ship channel cut in the northwest comer
of the cutoff island. What appears to be a long dock extends
out from the northern entrance of the channel on the opposite (western) shore (near the bold "F" in Figure 4). Two
other docks and two smaller buildings are depicted along
the northern shore of Morgans Point along with what has
been interpreted as a graded area, outlined with a dashed
line (see Figure 4)(Hoyt et al. 1998:58). Finally, what appears
to be a small separate building, perhaps a residence, is shown
along the shore at the northeastern comer of the cutoff island. What relationship this building had to the cluster of
other buildings and docks (presumably the shipyard) is unclear.

47

The Harris County Tax Rolls list yearly entries for a
"Shipyard at Morgans Point" in 1875-1877 and again in 1879
(Schmidt and Foster 1997:86). Various persons are listed as
agents or representatives of the shipyard, but ownership
and other details are unclear. Yet another Corps of Engineers
map, produced two decades later in 1897 does not depict
any shoreline features in the 41HR685/Morgans Point area,
although such features may have been intentionally omitted
(Hoyt et al. 1998:58). Given the extensive shoreline loss and
modification of both the northern and western edges of
Atkinson Island since the 1870s due to channel widening,
erosion, and subsidence (detailed in the following section),
all but a portion of the easternmost dock, the graded area,
and the solitary structure in the northeastern corner almost
certainly now lie within the Houston and Cedar Bayou channels (cf. overlay maps in Foster et al. 1993; Hoyt et al. 1998:Figure B-23).
In this century there is very little evidence of use of
Atkinson Island. Other than the disposal of dredged sediment (mainly along the eastern edge of the main Houston
Ship Channel) and the presence of occasional small structures (typically on the same somewhat higher madeland deposits), the cutoff island appears to have been largely undeveloped. For example, a 1905 Corps of Engineers map (Figure 5) depicts what may be one or more small structures
along the western shore of Atkinson Island on a strip of
higher ground (presumably redeposited dredged sediments)
bordering a much lower, swampier area to the east. Note in
particular that, with the exception of the madeland portion,
the entire northern shoreline of the cutoff island is depicted
as uniformly marshy. Extensive deposition of dredged material from the main Houston Ship Channel along the eastern
margin of the channel by this time is indicated by the long,
narrow extension of emergent madeland extending southward from the original peninsula (see Figure 5).
What appears to be a small gridwork of streets and
associated structures is evident on this 1905 map (see Figure 5). They are clearly west of the ship channel cut but east
of the bluffline, occupying an area of slightly higher ground
that is not mapped as marshy, possibly due to some amount
of dredge disposal. This is probably not the short-lived town
of Bayview (platted in 1893), which probably occupied the
adjacent bluff (Hoyt et al. 1998:Figure B-23), but rather the
town of Morgans Point. Hoyt et al. ( 1998 :57) note that in the
early 1900s, Morgans Point was the site of some shipbuilding and other industry. They further state that subsequent
widening of the ship channel probably destroyed these
former industrial sites. If so, the 1905 map (see Figure 5)
probably depicts the layout of this townsite.
One reason that Atkinson Island failed to develop an
industrial or commercial base is the channel itself. Indeed,
the channel isolated the former tip of the peninsula, requiring transportation by boat or barge. Furthermore, the lowlying land must have been subjected to periodic inundation,
especially following the rapid development of the nearby

FIGURE 4. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 1877 map of the area of
41HR685 showing the shipyard.

Goose Creek oil field between 1916 and 1918 (Benham 1996
and below). Major hurricanes (such as those in 1875, 1900,
and 1915; see Bomar 1995a; Paine and Morton 1986) would
have inundated all but the bluff. For example, an 1854 storm
is reported to have nearly completely submerged Hog and
Spilmans Islands (Ashbel Smith quoted in Schmidt and Foster 1997:79-80), while the 1875 hurricane washed over Hog
and Badger Islands and nearly destroyed Lynchburg
(Schmidt and Foster 1997: 15, 70-71 )(see Figure 1). The structures shown on Figure 4 were probably built (or perhaps
rebuilt) following this storm. The "West India Hurricane" in
1900 caused a 20-ft storm surge at Galveston and claimed
approximately 6,000 lives (Bomar 1995a). In another instance,
the fierce 1915 storm sank a Corps of Engineers quarterboat
at Morgans Point (Alperin 1977: 107-110). Coupled with accelerated rates of subsidence and periodic inundation, transportation problems likely isolated Atkinson Island rendering it largely unsuitable for residential or industrial development and thereby protected it from extensive impacts related
to development such as seen elsewhere in the project area.
The possible structures along the western edge of
Atkinson Island in 1905 (see Figure 5) may have survived

49

until 1916-1917 when a survey was completed that was eventually published in 1919 and 1920 as United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic maps of the Morgans Point and La Porte quadrangles (Figure 6). These maps
indicate the presence of at least one structure (Site 35-201 in
Hoyt et al. 1998) along the Houston Ship Channel on an
artificial rise or terrace of dredged sediment immmediately
west of a large, conical dredge disposal mound. A second
structure may also have been mapped near the low marsh
along the southern edge of Atkinson Island (Site 35-210 in
Hoyt et al. 1998). Continued deposition of dredged material
along the eastern edge of the ship channel is indicated by
mounds of sediment extending southward from the island.
Rapid development of the Goose Creek oil and gas in. dustry after 1917 (Benham 1996; Hoyt et al. 1998:32-35), as
well as accelerated rates of groundwater pumping for residential and commercial usage, has greatly affected the Morgans Point/Atkinson Island (41HR685) area as well as nearby
sites. Localized subsidence of between 6 and 8 ft have been
reported in and around Tabbs Bay (e.g., Alperin 1977:231232; Paine and Morton 1986). This would, of course, adversely affect lowlands, such as those inferred from the nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century maps and descriptions
of Morgans peninsula. The effects of subsidence (and to
some degree, erosion) may be masked by the continued accumulation of organic, marshy sediments or artificially by
the redeposition of dredged sediment.
No unambiguous evidence of structures or other improvements on Atkinson Island are seen on a mosaic of
aerial photographs taken in 1930 (Figure 7). However, two
ships lie just off the northern shore of the island. The ship
nearer the shore appears to be stranded and listing sharply
to starboard (Hoyt et al. 1998: 113). The other ship may be
conducting salvage or lightering operations. Both are clearly
offshore, and there are no indications of any nearby strutures
or features along the shoreline.
Subsequent USGS topographic maps published in 1955
(Figure 8), 1967 (Figure 9), and 1982 (Figure 10) likewise show
no evidence of structures or other man-made features on
Atkinson Island with the exception of benchmarks or mounds
of redeposited dredged sediment along the western half of
the island. There appear to have been no significant occupations or use of the island (other than for dredge disposal)
since 1920. However, a Tobin oil field property map (probably made sometime between 1955 and 1967) indicates that
ca. 159 acres of Atkinson Island was at that time owned by
Mrs. Eddie A Sullivan (41HR681 TARL site file). The boundary between Harris County (north of the line) and Chambers
County (to the south) runs along what once was the southern edge of Morgans Point.
An unidentified elderly informant related that when he
was a child in the 1930s and 1940s, rabbit hunts were common on Atkinson Island. This involved setting fire to vegetation at the southern end of the island, which then drove
the rabbits to the north shore where they were killed en

masse. A portion of the rabbits were then sold for "two-bits,
four-bits cleaned." He also reported that pottery sherds were
often seen on the beach as well "as true at most places"
along the shoreline of the Upper Galveston Bay.

Currently, the island is state land administered as a wildlife management area by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (Tyler et al. 1996). Its principal purpose is the preservation of shorebird habitat.

Geomorphology and Shoreline Reconstructions
Reconstructing the geomorphology and shoreline
changes that have occurred in the vicinity of 41HR685 requires an appreciation and understanding of the ongoing
natural and human forces that have shaped Morgans Point
and Atkinson Island. Cultural impacts on the current and
past landscape include both direct and indirect effects. The
most obvious direct impact is the bisection of the peninsula

with an artificial canal in the 1870s to bypass Clopper's Bar.
Other examples include the deposition of dredged sediment
to artificially raise the elevation of the cut-off Atkinson Island and adjacent low areas of Morgans Point. The lack of
industrial development on Atkinson Island in the twentieth
century and other consequences of historic land-use strategies may also be mentioned. The primary indirect cultural
impact is extensive subsidence due to development of the
nearby Goose Creek!fabbs Bay oil and gas field and exces-

sive groundwater pumping. These practices combined to
cause between 6 and 8 ft of subsidence in the immediate
vicinity of Baytown (including Morgans Point) since about
1920. Other major indirect cultural impacts are alteration (both
erosion and deposition) of shorelines caused by ever-increasing ship traffic and wakes as well as changing current

and flow patterns between Upper Galveston Bay and the
lower San Jacinto River. For example, the artificial canal bypassing Clopper's Bar provides a more direct route that certainly influences the effect(s) of natural high water events
such as hurricanes and floods. Small alterations may have
dramatic consequences.

Natural forces affecting the 41HR685/Morgans Point
area include tidal flow regimes, large-scale meteorological
events such as floods and hurricanes, and also the natural
growth and regeneration of marshes. The latter can be a
significant mechanism in the formation cif new sediments
and is believed to have been an important factor at Atkinson

Island as the original landform gradually subsided. Along
with redeposition of allochthonous dredged material, marsh
growth can give the impression that little has changed when
in fact significant subsidence has occurred. The main difference is that marsh growth tends to maintain a sort of equilibrium-the maximum elevation will not exceed by much the

tidal or average water line level, while dredge deposition can
almost instantaneously raise ground surfaces well above
the water line. When it appears that the elevation of a particular landmass has remained more or less stable over a
period of time during which subsidence has been clearly
documented in the immediate area, it is reasonable to con-

elude that land is being added at roughly the same rate at
which it is subsiding. Such does appear to be the case at
Morgans Point.
The primary objective of this section is to again review
the historical cartographic and aerial photographic evidence
evaluated in the previous section but with a focus on data

related to shoreline positions and alterations through time
and how such changes may affect or condition the preservation of both historic and prehistoric sites that may have
existed on these landforms (Table 2 in Appendix A). Finally,
a projection of four previous shoreline positions has been
overlain on a ca. 1995 aerial photograph of Morgans Point
(Figure 11). These shorelines have been georectified following the procedures outlined in Chapter 2 of this report. This
allows for a more accurate comparison of shoreline positions in order to estimate the extent and rate of shoreline
loss and how this might affect cultural resources originally

onshore or inland. This section deals primarily with cartographic and aerial photographic evidence and provides an
overall reconstruction of landscape changes at Morgans
Point/Atkinson Island. A more-detailed discussion is included in the following section, after integrating the additional data obtained during the 1997 TARL investigations.
The earliest detailed maps of the Morgans Point area in
the mid nineteenth century (see Figure 2) clearly show a
higher bluff area with a small eastward projecting spur at its
northeastern corner. Extending eastward below this spur is a
fairly wide, relatively long peninsula of vegetated land with

Morgans Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

56

marshy edges (see Figure 2). This peninsula presumably
formed from the combined forces of alluvial deposition from
the south-southeastward flowing San Jacinto River, reworking of these sediments where they encountered clockwise
longshore currents generated in the Upper Galveston Bay,
and sediments eroded from Upper Galveston Bay bluffs and
transported alongshore to the peninsula. As the peninsula
grew, the San Jacinto River was gradually shunted eastward. Clopper's Bar, an active, shifting sandbar off the eastern edge of Morgans Point was the leading edge of this
land-building process where the San Jacinto River entered
or emptied into Upper Glaveston Bay. Clopper's Bar remained
a significant barrier to navigation until the point was bisected by a canal in the early-to-mid 1870s. The proximity of
Clapper's Bar was also responsible in part for the quality
and attention to detail evident in the nineteenth-century
maps of this area.
By the time the first Corps of Engineers survey of the
point occurred in the winter of 1870-1871, efforts were already underway to dig a canal across the peninsula (see
Figure 3). Although no topographic details are indicated on
the map, the canal was certainly located east of the bluffline
(as demonstrated on later maps and from modern observations). No elevational data were recorded on a map made in
1876-1877 shortly after the channel cut across the point (see
Figure 4) although bathymetric cross sections were drawn.
After the turn of the century, a small townsite (likely
known as Morgans Point, see previous section) developed
on slightly higher ground, possibly raised by the deposition
of dredged sediment, directly west of the channel (see Figure 5). Likewise, the western edge of Atkinson Island was
artificially raised by redeposited material while the eastern
four-fifths of the island remained low and marshy (see Figure 5). Approximately 10 years later (in 1916) when the first
detailed topographical survey was conducted by the USGS
(see Figure 6), the effects of dredge disposal can be clearly
seen. One-foot topographic contour lines indicate a major
cone of redeposited material, as well as several smaller areas, along the western edge of Atkinson Island (see Figure
6). A string of mounds extending southward from the island
are also visible along the eastern edge of the ship channel in
this figure. The remainder of the island is shown as a low
(less than 3 ft high) area with marshy edges, especially along
the southern edge of the cutoff island. A soil survey of
Harris County conducted in 1922 mapped Atkinson Island
as mainly Harris clay soils with some areas of tidal marsh
and a band ofmadeland (dredged sediment) along its western shore (Geib et al. 1928). Harris clay soils were described
as "little more than semideveloped soils, and are more or
less marshy, lying on the higher marginal areas of the tidal
marshes where drainage is better than on tidal-marsh areas"
(Geib et al. 1928:1921) with abundant organic matter and
poor drainage. Finally, across the ship channel, the entire
area of lower ground between the channel and the valley
wall bluff was mapped as madeland, supporting the suppo-

sition that the early-twentieth-century township developed
there was built on an artificially raised surface of dredged
material.
A 1930 aerial photograph clearly indicates the continued deposition (and probable reworking) of dredged material on the western half of Atkinson Island (see Figure 7).
Dredged sediments are white while vegetated areas are darkcolored. What may be a berm of redeposited dredge material
or shell appears to ring the northern and eastern edges of
the island (see Figure 7; Table 2 in Appendix A). Some rounding of the island and widening of the ship channel pass
through Morgans Point is evident as well. The artificial, linear peninsula of dredged material extending from the southwestern corner of the island continued to build (see Figure
7).

The same conditions and trends are evident on topographic maps produced in 1943 (see Table 2 in Appendix A)
and 1954-1955 (see Figure 8). The ship channel continued to
widen and extensive deposition of dredged sediment formed
a distinctive, roughly triangular area of higher ground on
the western half of Atkinson Island. The remainder of the
island is shown as less than 3 ft in elevation (including the
41HR685 area along the northern shore). The redeposited
sediment along the eastern edge of the ship channel continued to widen and was mapped as part of Atkinson Island
(see Figure 8). Note also on Figure 8 the large number of oil
wells in and around Tabbs Bay (the area labeled "Goose
Creek Oil Field") north of Morgans Point and "Hogg" Island.
A 1956 aerial photograph (see Table 2 in Appendix A)
appears to show a berm along the northern shore of Atkinson
Island with standing water behind (southward or landward
of) it. No evidence of such a berm is apparent on a 1967
USGS topographic map (see Figure 9) although the same
trends in terms of channel widening and dredge disposal
noted earlier appear to have continued. Note also that a
channel has apparently been cut into the southward extension of Atkinson Island (just behind the mounds along the
eastern edge of the ship channel). Regardless of the purpose of this side channel, clearly by this time erosion and/or
subsidence had begun to reduce the size and extent of the
mounds of dredged sediments. By 1974, the berm along the
northern shore of Atkinson Island had been breached and
standing water was evident over parts of the island (see
Table 2 in Appendix A). The 1975 survey conducted for the
USGS topographic map eventually published in 1982 (see
Figure 10) dramatically demonstrates the extent of shoreline
loss along both the western and northern shorelines of
Atkinson Island.Â· Subsidence and/or erosion had also furtherreduced the size and extent of dredge mounds along the
entire length of Atkinson Island. The southeastern portion
of the former peninsula is clearly shown as a tidal marsh (see
Figure 10).
The observed trends and alterations of the Morgans
Point/Atkinson Island area have been standardized and com-

piled on a single projection, showing shoreline positions in
1851, 1930, and 1982 overlaid on a 1995 aerial photograph
(see Figure 11). Even in the dozen or so years between 1982
(when the aerial photograph used for this shoreline reconstruction was taken, see Table 2 in Appendix A) and 1995
when the aerial photograph projected here was taken, significant modification of Atkinson Island has taken place,
especially along its northwestern edge and northern shore
(i.e., in the immediate vicinity of the deposit identified/defined in 1990 as 41HR685). The final georectified map was
completed after the fieldwork phase of the project. The lobe
of beach sediments formed along the northern shore between 1982 and 1995 was noted in the field to be a significant, and likely recent, landform (discussed below). However, it is now clear that a few of the northernmost TARL
subsurface tests were in fact located within the limits of
what was open water less than 20 years before. Both the
1995 water and vegetation lines have been traced on Figure
11 due to apparent low water conditions when the photograph was taken.
Shoreline changes shown on Figure 11 can be summarized as follows. Significant lateral erosion and widening of
the ship channel cut through Morgans Point since 1930 has
certainly destroyed any historical sites that may have existed alongside the original channel cut, on either the
Atkinson Island or Morgans Point side. This includes the
structure(s) indicated on the western shore of Atkinson Island in 1916 (see Figure 6) as well as most, if not all, of the
shipyard facilities shown on the earlier 1876-1877 map (see
Figure 4). Even the easternmost dock, the graded area, and
the small, isolated structure at the northeastern corner of the
island shown on that map, although they may have been far
enough east to avoid the effects of channel widening (cf.
Hoyt et al. 1998:Figure B-23), have almost certainly been
destroyed by the ca. 50-100 m of shoreline loss along the
northern and eastern shorelines since 1930 (see Figure 11).
However, the possibility remains that intact prehistoric or
historic occupations or materials that were originally set back
somewhat from the shore might yet survive.
Post-1916 historical topographic maps and aerial photographs reviewed in this section consistently describe the
interior, natural ground surface of Atkinson Island as low
lying, typically no higher than 3 ft above mean sea level (see
also Table 2 in Appendix A). Nonetheless, significant subsidence during this period has been documented at nearby
Baytown and the Goose Creekffabbs Bay oil fields (e.g.,
Alperin 1977: 231-232; Gabrysh and Coplin 1990; Paine and
Morton 1986) due to excessive extraction of geofluids. Why
then does one find such consistency in terms of elevation at
Atkinson Island? A likely answer is that as the original
ground surface sank closer to the water line, an extensive,
highly organic marsh developed on the flat interior of the
island and which thereafter continued to aggrade, depositing thick carpets of grasses, organic materials, and trapped
sediments (brought in during periodic floods or which had

57

been reworked from dredge deposits), keeping pace with
subsidence and maintaining the observed elevational consistency. These poorly consolidated deposits would have
been protected from the destructive forces of shipwakes in
the main Houston Ship Channel by the band of dredged
sediments (mainly clay) forming the western shore of the
island. Along the northern shore, little or no protection other
than a sand and shell beach would have been available,
although ship traffic in the Cedar Bayou channel is both less
frequent and of a smaller magnitude (due to smaller ships)
than is true of the main channel.
Finally, there is no possibility of finding intact historic
remains on the madeland southern extension of Atkinson
Island dating to before 1905 (see Figure 5), although there
are no indications from either known maps or aerial photographs that any occupation of this portion of the island ever
took place. Furthermore, extensive shoreline loss along even
this portion of the island since 1930 (see Figure 11) suggests
any potentially relevant remains, even had they existed, have
probably now been lost.
Despite the observed extent and timing of shoreline
loss and the evidence for a perenially wet, marshy island
interior, the original geomorphic assessment suggested that
given the absence of extensive commercial development or
disturbance it was possible that intact prehistoric or historic
remains might be found at 41 HR685. If present, the question
remained whether these materials would be found on original ground surfaces now at, or well below, the modern water
line.

1997 TARL Investigations
Based on cartographic and aerial photographic evidence
discussed in the previous section, the 1997 TARL survey
team recognized some potential for locating intact archeological deposits at this locality, although it seemed likely
that any original surfaces were now below the water line and
that the modern shoreline is as much as 100 m inland from
the 1851 shoreline position (see Figure 11). Despite these
reservations, TARL conducted intensive surface and subsurface investigations including pedestrian survey, the excavation of nearly two dozen (N=23) shovel and auger
probes. A small test trench was dug near the northwestern
corner of the island in order to assess site 41HR685 (as defined in 1990), to determine the relationships among the various deposits and artifacts, to understand the processes of
landscape alteration that have transformed Atkinson Island,
and to determine how those processes conditioned the preservation or location of intact archeological deposits.
The review of cartographic, archival, and aerial photographic evidence outlined in earlier sections demonstrated
that Atkinson Island was unaffected (at least directly) by
twentieth-century industrial or residential development and,
furthermore, that the disposal of dredged sediment was largely
confined to its western edge and northwest corner. Historic

occupations and land use (other than cattle raising) in the
immediate 41HR685 site area apparently were restricted to a
relatively brief period in the 1870s. Both the lack of extensive
development and the absence of dredged sediments were
seen as favoring the preservation of archeological deposits
and remains. However, the low topographic relief of the original peninsula (and later island) combined with the degree/
amount of subsidence and shoreline erosion that has taken
place, suggested that intact prehistoric or historic site components were probably now inundated, perhaps within the
confines of the current shipping channels to the north and
west. If they were in fact offshore, then they had probably
been at least partially eroded. If so, artifacts and other remains related to those occupation(s) may have been reworked and redeposited, possibly on the current shoreline.
The definition of 41HR685 less than a decade earlier indicates that the "site" did in fact occupy the beach shoreline
and should be easily relocated. Despite the known negative
factors, prefield analysis could not rule out the existence of
intact historic or prehistoric site components. Therefore, a
major effort was made by TARL in 1997 to document and
understand the surface and subsurface deposits on the northern shore of Atkinson Island.
Atkinson Island was investigated over a period of several days in the summer of 1997 by TARL crews of between
five and eight persons. The initial effort was a reconnaissance of the northern and western shorelines of the island,
as well as assessing its grassy marsh interior. The eastern
half of the island, including the northern shoreline beyond
the area outlined on Figure 11, is extremely marshy and subaerially exposed only in patches, rendering it largely inaccessible. Following a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the
western two-thirds of the northern shoreline (within the area
defined on Figure 11) and along the western edge of Atkinson
Island to a point well south of the original southern edge of
Morgans peninsula, TARL investigations switched to shovel
and auger probing along the northern shore at 41HR685 in
search of intact archeological deposits. Although the precise character of intact sediments could not be known in
advance, the 1922 Harris County soil survey (Geib et al.
1928) served as a guide, suggesting that the original surface
in the vicinity of 41 HR685 was mainly Harris clay, although
more fluvial deposits might also be expected. It was hoped
that clear, distinct boundaries between intact sediments and
more recent overlying deposits might be recognized.
The subsurface shovel and auger testing can be best
characterized as survey probing, rather than shovel testing
(cf. Fields et al. 1996). Efforts were directed at demonstrating
the presence and location of possible intact archeological
deposits rather than on characterizing deposits and remains
known to be in primary cultural context. Sediments removed
during probing were not screened but rather carefully troweled through and examined for cultural and natural inclusions. Due to the limited depths possible using only shovels, probes were later deepened through the use of a 3-inch-

----------------------------

59

diameter bucket auger with a single (ca. 1-m long) handle
attachment. However, due to slumping caused by wet, unconsolidated sediments a larger gauge, 6-8-inch open bucket
auger was used. This large auger also had a handle extension which made it possible to reach maximum depths of
between 1.5 and 2.0 m. Depths were measured using either a
weighted measuring tape or directly marking the auger handle
prior to extraction. Sediment removed with the augers was
also carefully examined for natural and cultural inclusions.
Locations of the shovel probes were initially recorded using
the Trimble Pro-XR GPS equipment. During subsequent work
on auger transects A and B, these same shovel probe locations, as well as those of the additional subsurface tests
were measured using a transit. This was done because of
the imperfect resolution of elevational data available from
GPS equipment. All transit measurements were made relative to an arbitrary 100.00 m datum nail set into a wooden
boat dock on the north shore. The datum was assigned position 100 m North/100 m East on a site-specific grid system
oriented along magnetic north (roughly 4. 7Â° E of True North
in July 1997 in this area). Notes and photographs were made
of probes and of the general site area. One of the probes (Bl), near the northwest corner of the island, was expanded
into a small trench (roughly 1 m long by 0.5 m wide by 0.5 m
deep) in order to examine the relationship between what
appeared to be two separate shell berm deposits. This section was drawn, described, and photographed.
Reconnaissance of the northern and western shores of
Atkinson Island yielded a great deal of information about
current landform(s) and conditions. The current geomorphology of the northern shoreline has been significantly
modified over the past 15 or so years (see Figure 11 for a
comparison of the 1982 and 1995 shorelines). These changes
have occurred even since 1990 when 41HR685 was first defined and recorded. For example, while 41HR685 was easily
re-located, it is somewhat smaller than described in the TARL
site file. Nevertheless, it clearly remains in the same general
location and retains (for the most part) the resemblance or
structure originally described.
The present northern shore of Atkinson Island can be
separated into roughly three segments or areas. Beginning
at the actively eroding northwestern comer, the shoreline is
a dense accumulation of shell with a sandy matrix covered in
places by a thin lens of loose sand (Figure 12a). The shells
are primarily Rangia cuneata with some oyster ( Crassostrea
sp.) and rare specimens of other shell species. The Rangia
vary considerably in size and a few retain traces of
periostracum, revealing their recent origin. On and in this
shell are some scattered historic and some prehistoric artifacts.
At the extreme northwestern comer of the island, at and
just below the water line, is a dense, dark-colored organic
clay. Several pieces of rusted metal, as well as a few glass
fragments and salt-glazed pipe fragments, were found on
and partially in this clay but appeared to be deposited on the

clay rather than eroding from it. The clay was unconformably
overlain by the dense shell deposits just described, which
extend to or slightly below the water line.
Largely unvegetated, the dense shell beach is roughly
150-200 m long and is fairly narrow but wedge shaped, widening slightly to the east. As it widens, shell density gradually decreases and the beach becomes sandier. This occurs
less rapidly at the shore edge, where the wave energy of
shipwakes generated in the Houston Ship Channel is somewhat greater. Consequently, the interior of the widening
beach is somewhat sandier than the northwestern edge. The
shells comprising this deposit are almost all white or lightcolored; perhaps due to recent subaerial exposure. Conversely, the southern boundary of this wedge-shaped shell
beach deposit is a linear berm of weathered, slightly discolored (grayish) shell that roughly parallels the long axis of

the shoreline (Figure 13a). This appears to be a natural,
backbeach shell deposit and continues eastward at least as
far as the eastern edge of the area outlined in Figure 13a
where it dips downward and to the east before apparently
continuing beneath sea level. It appears to narrow somewhat as it continues eastward, from a maximum of perhaps
15 m just east of the northwest corner, to a more consistent
and narrow range of 3-5-m wide farther east. These shell
deposits appear to merge at the northwestern corner and are
almost certainly what is described as the 41 HR685 "prehistoric shell midden" deposit roughly 2,000 ft (ca. 600 m) long,
75 ft (ca. 22.5 m) wide, and 1 m thick (TARL site files). However, historic artifacts are incorporated into this shell deposit, including a piece of rusted sheet metal exposed at its
base along what later became Transect A, clearly indicating
a relatively recent origin.

Roughly 200-250 m east of the northwest corner, the
beach widens and becomes more sandy (see Figure 12b).
This broad expanse of uniform sandy sediment has only
scattered shell (again mainly Rangia sp.) and artifacts on
and in it. The sloping forebeach rises to the main beach (see
Figure 12b) which is slightly mounded. This main beach is
vegetated with dense grasses and some weedy bushes and
undergrowth. Surface shell density appears to continue decreasing from west to east in this portion of the beach. This
sandy beach was created, or at least greatly expanded, between 1982 and 1995 (see Figure 11). This laterally transgressive, eastward beach growth probably results from
shipwakes generated in the main Houston Ship Channel first
eroding and then redepositing sediments and inclusions,
including presumably historic and prehistoric artifacts. Later
subsurface testing revealed that this wide, sandy portion of
the beach is a fairly thick deposit (approaching 2 m). Again,
the southern boundary of this beach segment is the linear
berm of older, more weathered shell. Nearer the shell berm,
widely scattered small trees and shrubs are found.
As it does nearer the northwest corner, the older shell
berm here separates the sand and shell beach of the northern shore from the low, swampy interior of Atkinson Island
(see Figure 12c). This grassy marsh is at or just above the
water line with discontinuous patches of standing water.
The shell berm is less pronounced as a topographic feature
in the area of the sandy beach, perhaps due at least in part to
the mounded nature of the sandy beach itself.
As it continues eastward the wide, sandy beach gradually narrows and loses elevation. Eventually, this portion of
the beach pinches out (see Figure 12d) and is replaced by a
narrow band of seagrasses and discontinuous sandy
patches. The photograph in Figure 12d shows the older shell Â·
berm, marked by a line of trees, continuing eastward past
this point. The berm gradually loses elevation but continues
to form the northern boundary of the interior marsh until it
eventually grades into the marsh near the northeastern corner of Atkinson Island.
Historic materials are also found scattered on the shell
and sand northern shore of Atkinson Island. These include
saw-cut bone (primarily cow, see Appendix G), rusted metal,
coal, low-fired brick (some of which may be burned), glass,
and salt-glazed brownware pipe fragments in addition to
modem flotsam including plastic, rubber, and wood. The
pedestrian survey yielded only a single prehistoric sherd, a
somewhat eroded grog-tempered base. On subsequent visits, two additional sherds (one grog-tempered, the other
sandy paste) and a possibly cultural chert flake, were also
found exposed on the shell and sand beach surface near the
northwest comer of the island. The source of these artifacts,
all of which were recovered on the beach surface, appears to
be either an eroding inundated offshore site or alternatively
they are being reworked and eroded out of the dredge material along the western banks of Atkinson Island. All of the
prehistoric artifacts were collected, but only a few of the

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

historic items were retained.
There are a few areas along the northern shore of
Atkinson Island, especially near the eastern end of the wide,
sandy portion of the beach where historic materials do appear to be found in somewhat higher densities. These are
mainly brick and metal fragments, but some glass and ceramics also occur as do small areas of unbroken oyster shells
(not crushed as would expected for a road). In all cases,
these artifacts are underlain by the same recent sandy sediments found elsewhere on the beach. However, if the sandy
beach is indeed transgressing laterally to the east, then this
may be more apparent than real. The historic artifacts may
be uniformly distributed along the shoreline with the apparent lateral density differences due to either overlying recent
sand deposits or decreased visibility due to vegetation. On
the other hand, shipwake and tidal patterns could be artificially concentrating these secondary deposits. Given the
documented shoreline loss and the location of historically
mapped structures noted in previous sections, it seems likely
that much of this historic material is being eroded from original, offshore locations in the Cedar Bayou and Houston
Ship Channels. Another source, especially of the prehistoric artifacts, may be eroding deposits of dredged sediment
along the western shore of Atkinson Island. Consequently,
these areas of higher density of historic material do not appear to represent or correlate with the actual locations of
historic occupation or site use, most of which appear to
have been farther west, in what is today the main channel.
The entire length of the western edge of the island
(fronting the main Houston Ship Channel) was also assessed.
Although this shore is beyond the defined limits of 41HR685,
its exposed bankline sections and adjacent deposits were
closely examined for any evidence of the original historic
ground surfaces preserved above the water line. The 100
percent pedestrian survey of this shoreline revealed an erosional and highly dynamic shoreline. The TARL survey continued to a point well south of the original southern shore of
Atkinson Island (see Figures 2 and 11), prior to the creation
of an artificial peninsula or southward extension of the island along the eastern edge of the main ship channel.
The western shore in the vicinity of the original Atkinson
Island is a steep bank ca. 1 to 2.5 m in height composed
almost exclusively of dredged material. In places these
dredged clays unconformably overlie marshy sediments with
decomposing grass stalks and roots that are exposed at or
just above the water line. In other places, the bankline is
lower and the same marshy sediments are subaerially exposed. Shipwakes strike this bankline with tremendous force
and are actively eroding these sediments. It appears that
channel widening is exposing aggrading interior marsh sediments as well as mounds of dredged material deposited at
various times, either on those marshy sediments or on earlier dredge deposits. There is very little shell on this portion
of the western shoreline, but farther south the bankline becomes less steep and eventually grades into a low beach

Chapter 6: Investigations at 41HR405, 4JHR577, 41HR680, 41HR681, and 41HR685

with a very high density of naturally accumulated shell. Here

it appears that the active disposal of dredged sediments has
ceased, and the existing deposits have largely eroded and/
or subsided. There is no evidence for the preservation of
historic surfaces above the water line. No unconformable
stratigraphic contacts (other than dredge on marsh) were
observed. The frequency and ferocity of shipwakes, the
narrow footing along the bankline, and a low starting elevation precluded subsurface (subsea level) testing along the
western edge of the original extent of Atkinson Island.
Artifacts observed along this shoreline were primarily
small pieces of heavily rusted metal and brick fragments, as
well as a small amount of glass. Modem flotsam was particularly abundant along the southern stretches of shell beach.
No prehistoric artifacts were observed, and no artifacts were
collected.
Following the pedestrian survey of the beach, TARL
investigations shifted to the excavation of a series of shovel
probes and auger probes. The objectives of these subsurface tests included attempting to determine the depth and
extent of the observed surface sediment deposits as well as
the substrate of the sand and shell deposits recorded as
41HR685. The primary reason, however, was to demonstrate
whether, in light of the extensive erosion and subsidence
known to have affected the island, intact historic surfaces
and archeological deposits remained above the water line
beneath the defined "site." Eventually 15 shovel probes, 7
separate auger probes (and augering within 2 existing shovel
probes), and 1 small trench were excavated in order to address and answer these concerns. The locations of these
tests are shown on Figure 13b. Sediment descriptions, artifacts recovered, and other results are given in Appendix L.
As mentioned above, a few of the more northerly subsurface tests clearly lie on beach deposits postdating 1982 when
they were at least tidally indundated areas (cf. Figure 11).
The 15 shovel probes were numbered sequentially in
the order that they were completed. The first six were laid
out at irregular intervals on the wide, sandy portion of the
northern shoreline (see Figure 13b). The first, Shovel Probe
1, was placed where the single prehistoric sherd was found
during the beach survey. It is roughly at the juncture between the forebeach and the vegetated mid-beach. The next
five were also spread out along the shoreline nearby. Most,
if not all, of these first six probes were later determined to be
within the former channel or tidal beach (i.e., on land deposited since 1982; cf. Figure 11). The next two were laid out
along a rough transect (that later became Transect A; see
Figure 13b) cut back into the heavy vegetation nearer the
berm and the interior. Shovel Probe 7 was placed just north
of the older shell berm and Shovel Probe 8 was placed just
south of the berm, in the low, marshy interior. It was necessary to cut paths into the dense backbeach and marsh vegetation to set these tests. Likewise, Shovel Probes 9 and 10
were placed on either side of the shell berm. However, the
latter probe was landward of what appeared to be a breached

63

or low portion of the shell berm where a lobe of sand had
been washed into and over the surrounding marsh deposits
(a scenario supported by the stratigraphic results; see Appendix L). Note that the surface elevation of Shovel Probe 10
was nearly 0 .5 m lower than many of the other probes. Shovel
Probes 1, 2, 9, and 10 all lie on a line perpendicular to the
widest part of the recent sand and shell beach. Four of the
remaining shovel probes (11, 13, 14, and 15) were laid out
along the sand and shell beach, north of but close to the the
shell berm. However, nearer the northwestern corner of
Atkinson Island, the shell beach converges with the shell
berm, which itself gets somewhat wider, making such distinctions difficult. Finally, Shovel Probe 12 was placed near
the eastern end of the sandy beach accumulation.
To summarize, the shovel probes were spread out along
north shore, from near the northwest comer (no. 15, on the
older shell berm) to almost the eastern terminus of the modern sandy beach (no. 12; see Figure 13b) The objective was
to get sufficient coverage to account for lateral differences,
especially given the active nature of the beach erosion/deposition patterns while at the same time searching for evidence
of intact sediments. Beginning for the most part in sand or
shell deposits, it was hoped that a distinct unconformity
might mark the presence of intact sediments (e.g., the descriptions of Harris clays in Geib et al. 1928).
Although the data from the shovel probes are complex
in detail (see Appendix L), they can be summarized or generalized as follows. Nearer the northwest comer, where the
beach surface is composed chiefly of shell, three of the four
probes (15, 13, and 11) indicate that the dense shell is only
25 to 50 cm thick and overlies more sandy deposits with less
shell. On the other hand, the subsurface deposits east of
Shovel Probe 11, are more uniformly comprised of fine sand
and evenly distributed Rangia and some oyster shells. The
density of shell appears to vary in these units but in several
(notably Shovel Probes 2, 4, 5, and 7) the amount of Rangia
and oyster shell actually increases with depth, although there
are exceptions (e.g., Shovel Probe 6; see Appendix L). These
lateral differences suggest that erosive longshore drift related to shipwakes may be separating the shell and sand
while building a thick lobe of sand east of Shovel Probe 11
(see Figure 13b).
Twelve of the 15 shovel probes encountered only sand
and shell deposits despite the fact that at least 9 of them
intersected the water line at elevations ranging between 97. 88
and 97 .54 m (arbitrary 100-m-datum elevations), or generally
between .5 and 1.0 m below ground surface. Given that these
probes were excavated at various times on different days,
the observed water line elevations may be taken as the average tidal range. Three of the probes farther inland-Shovel
Probe 7 just north of the shell berm and Probes 8 and 10
south of it on the interior marshy plain-encountered dark
clayey marsh sediments with abundant organic material including identifiable plant stalks and stems at elevations between 97.93 and 97.67 m (within or just above the observed

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

64

tidal range). When encountered while buried, this sediment
had a distinctive foul or chemical odor. Shovel Probe 8 encountered these sediments at the surface within the interior
marshy plain (about 20 cm above the water line at the time
the probe was dug). The slightly higher elevation of this
sediment type here suggests that at this location the marsh
continues to aggrade whereas the same deposits already
buried by sand have obviously ceased aggrading. In Shovel
Probe 7, the marshy sediments appear to have been recently
buried by sand (containing redeposited, water worn historic
artifacts). The elevation of the upper surface of the marsh
deposits (ca. 97.79 m) is within the tidal range supporting a
recent burial, perhaps after being exposed and partially
eroded; the deposit does not appear to have subsided.
Artifacts recovered during the TARL surface survey
and shovel probe investigations include a total of three prehistoric sherds (two grog tempered and one sandy paste)
and a possibly cultural chert flake. All three sherds have
clear evidence of having been waterwom and were found on
the beach surface. Historic artifacts include soft red brick,
glass fragments, rusted metal, and both unburned and burned
coal. One of the glass pieces is an aqua-colored bottle stopper with a pontil scar (Shovel Probe 6). Another from Shovel
Probe 7 is a clear glass bottle base fragment with raised
letters "D 10 / 1819" along with what appear to be two offset
number 3's (or possibly cursive F's) in a circle. If these are in
fact F's then the bottle was likely manufactured some time
after 1929 by the Forbes and Foster Co. in Marion, Illinois
(Toulouse 1971). All bone recovered and positively identified was from cow and appeared to be saw cut (see Appendix G).
The extensive historic brickmaking industry on nearby
Cedar Bayou may bear on the 4 IHR685 investigations (Cartier
and Hole 1972:61-78; Smith 1996; Steinbomer 1982; Whitsett
1977, 1980; see also Appendix F). Beginning soon after initial settlement of the project area by Euroamericans in the
1870s, bricks were being made at various places for local
use, a pattern typical throughout Texas (Steinbomer 1982).
A detailed first-hand account of the sand-struck brickmaking
process used on Cedar Bayou is found in Cartier and Hole
(1972:61-78). These locally made bricks seldom have identifying marks and are often softer and easily worn and eroded.
The lower quality of the bricks, however, was offset by their
availability and relatively low cost, and they were therefore
used extensively in the latter half of the nineteenth and the
early twentieth century. Residents of Cedar Bayou began
making bricks soon after the Texas Revolution, but the greatest production appears to have begun in the 1870s
(Steinbomer 1982; Whitsett 1977). The 1870s was also the
period when a shipyard occupied the northwest shoreline of
Atkinson Island (see Figure 3) and when Morgans cut was
completed. Brickmaking on Cedar Bayou waned after World
War I due to the more lucrative opportunities afforded by
the Goose Creek oil field. The large number of brick fragments observed at 41 HR685/Atkinson Island may therefore

-------------------~

------~

be useful for providing some information on the time period
of use, although all have been found in redeposited contexts and furthermore, all identifiable fragments appear to
have been machine molded and were thus probably imported
from elsewhere. Machine-molded bricks were uncommon in
the U.S. until the last quarter of the nineteenth century
(McKee 1973:41-61). It appears, however, that traditional
nonmechanical brickmaking persisted in at least some of the
brickyards well into this century (Cartier and Hole 1972:6178). Given the proximity of Morgans Point to major shipping
and railroad facilities, the presence of "imported" machinemolded brick is not surprising (cf. Steinbomer 1982). Clearly,
most if not all of the bricks recovered during the TARL investigations are machine molded and therefore postdate 1870.
Historic artifacts and Rangia and oyster shell were found
scattered throughout the sand and shell deposits, mainly in
the upper, fine-grained sand but also intermittently at deeper
levels (see Appendix L). For example, a plastic shotgun shell
at 60 cm below surface (ca. 98.00 m) and a brown glass fragment at 80 cm below surface (ca. 97.85 m) were recovered
from Shovel Probes 7 and 11, respectively, both of which are
just north of the older shell berm that is believed to be somewhat older than the recently reworked sand and shell beach
deposits nearer the Cedar Bayou Channel. No artifacts were
recovered below the water line or within the buried organic
marsh deposits.
Overall, the historic artifacts are consistent with latenineteenth- and early-twentieth-century occupations on
Atkinson Island. Although many of the historic artifacts
were recovered in subsurface contexts, all were found in
redeposited, secondary contexts. In addition, modem material including plastic and rubber were also found on the surface and in subsurface sand deposits.
Afterthe surface survey and excavating these 15 shovel
probes, it was apparent that intact archeological surfaces or
deposits had not been reached by any of the shovel probes
nor exposed at the surface within the area previously defined as 41 HR685. All of the artifacts were recovered from
redeposited, secondary contexts. There was absolutely no
evidence of anything resembling an intact archeological
deposit above the tidal water line range. However, because
of the limitations of shovels and a small gauge auger in
inundated sediments, the depth at which intact historic surfaces did occur remained unknown. The apparently continuing erosion of archeological deposits offshore suggested
that intact deposits should exist somewhere below the water
line. Further testing was necessary to determine if and where
intact sediments might occur.
In order to resolve the question of how deep
archeologically relevant surfaces might be, and also to refine understanding of the geomorphological formation processes shaping Atkinson Island, TARL investigations
shifted to the excavation of essentially geological (as
oppposed to strictly archeological) auger probes along two
transects (labeled A and B in Figure l 3b ), although the sedi-

--~----

Chapter 6: Investigations at 41HR405, 41HR577, 41HR680, 41HR681, and 41HR685

ments continued to be examined closely for evidence of artifacts or other relevant inclusions. Transect A was laid out
perpendicular to the shoreline near the widest section of the
transgressing sandy beach. The probes were laid out roughly
7 m apart, extending from Al (near the water line on the
forebeach) to A7 (which was set about 1 m from Shovel
Probe 8 on the interior marshy plain, south of the shell berm).
Transect A ran between Shovel Probes 5 and 6 and incorporated the already-excavated Shovel Probe 7, which was
cleaned out and continued as Auger Probe A5 (see Figure
13b). The auger probes along Transect A were excavated
using a larger gauge open bucket auger bit with a shaft
extension that allowed for deeper penetration through saturated, unconsolidated sediments. While slumping continued to be a problem, the new auger setup permitted the
testing of sediments approaching 2 m below ground surface
(e.g., Auger Probe A3, see Appendix L). Auger Probe A6
was not excavated.
The second auger transect (B, see Figure 13b) was laid
out perpendicular to the actively eroding northwest comer
of Atkinson Island, from the point of convergence of the
older shell berm and the shell beach deposit eastward to
near the interior marsh. At or just below the water line in the
northwest comer was a dark organic clay with scattered
shell and historic material on its surface, including rusted
metal bars, brownware ceramic pipe, red brick, and coarse
concrete/shellcrete. This clay also contained some decaying vegetal fibers. The primary objective of this transect was
to refine the relationship(s) between the shell deposits and,
more importantly, determine whether the exposed clay just
below the water line at the northwestern corner could be
related to the interior marshy sediments in order to rule out
any possibility of it being an intact, archeologically relevant
deposit. It was not considered to be as necessary on this
transect to encounter unmistakably intact deposits so the
narrower gauge auger was used for these probes.
Auger Probe B 1 was placed at the point where it appeared on the surface that the two shell deposits merged:
the apparently older, more weathered grayish shell berm and
the presumably more recent and less weathered, shell beach.
This probe began as a simple auger test but it immediately
became apparent that it would be beneficial to see a clean
section of the contact between the older and newer shell
facies, so it was expanded into a small trench. The cleaned
section revealed that the beach shell lies unconformably
against, and perhaps partially inset into, the older shell deposit. The boundary between them is clear to abrupt. This
configuration is most consistent with reworking of new and
eroded shell along the north shore through the action of
shipwakes, perhaps following partial erosion of the shell
berm.
The results from the remaining auger probes are presented in Appendix L. A determined effort to probe as deeply
as possible was rewarded in Auger Probe A3, which reached
a maximum depth of 190 cm below surface. What are be-

65

lieved to be intact Harris clay deposits were encountered in
this probe at about 96.85 m (ca. 160 cm below surface). The
sediment was dark gray, silty clay that contained manganese nodules and some Rangia shell but no artifacts. The
depth of this contact in A3 is approximately 20 cm deeper
than the maximum depth of the next deepest probe (Auger
Probe Al) and more than 0.5 Ill deeper than most of the
shovel probes. The depth of the apparently intact Harris
Clay sediment below the tidal range observed during TARL
investigations is between 70 and 100 cm. Assuming a maximum preindundation natural surface elevation of ca. 5 ft (see
discussion in previous section and Figure 6), this results in
an estimated local subsidence of between (ca.) 7.3 and 8.3 ft.
This matches quite well the estimate of 8.2 ft often cited for
the immediate Baytown area (e.g., Alperin 1977 :231; Paine
and Morton 1986), which further supports the conclusion
that this is indeed the historic (pre-1918) surface and deposit. The organic, foul-smelling clay deposits encountered
elsewhere are more than 2 ft higher (ca. 70 cm). This appears
to be too shallow given the originally low historical topography and the close proximity of the Goose Creek/Tabbs Bay
oil field (e.g., see Figures 6 and 8).
The remaining results from Auger Transects A and B
are not discussed in detail but instead have been integrated,
along with the data from nearby shovel probes, into two
idealized cross-sections (Figure 14) that aptly illustrate both
the specific results along each transect and, perhaps more
importantly, the comprehensive model of landscape evolution and reconstructed stratigraphy at Atkinson Island/
41HR685. This model is based not only on the results of the
TARL field investigations but also on information gleaned
from historic maps and aerial photographs, archival data,
and an appreciation oflocal effects such as post-World War
I subsidence. It summarizes and organizes many of the inferences and observations presented thus far.
Figure l 4a shows the generalized cross section of sediments along Transect A (see Figure l 3b). The intact historical surface encountered in Auger Probe A3 nearly 1 m below
the observed high tide is composed of mid to late Holocene
marsh and flu vial deposits. Somewhere between Auger Probe
A3 and the shell berm is a former erosional interface, now
buried by coarse sand, where this historic surface and/or
the overlying marshy sediments accumulated on it were exposed prior to burial by the sand and shell beach. The historic surface probably extends offshore into the Cedar Bayou
Ship Channel where it may be continuing to erode. Nearer
the current shoreline, this surface is buried by the sand and
shell beach. South of the older shell berm the marsh continues to aggrade, keeping pace with subsidence. The relatively recent origin of the shell berm is attested by the metal
buried near its base.
Figure l 4b depicts the somewhat more complicated reconstructed cross section along Transect B at the northwest comer of Atkinson Island (see Figure 13b). Here the
eroding edge of the interior marsh has not yet been com-

pletely buried. Because of the rapid erosion occurring at this
point, the marsh deposits are exposed at the water line and
are only thinly draped by protective deposits (mainly shell).
The contact between this shell beach and the older shell
berm has been described in reference to Auger Probe B 1.
High energy wave action also causes sand to periodically
wash over the older shell berm and cover the marsh behind
it. Likewise, especially along the western edge of the island,
mottled dredged clays have been directly deposited on these
marsh sediments. In some places, dredged clays continue
down to and below the water line, suggesting that they were
deposited somewhat earlier. Marsh grasses and deposits
buried by madeland or sand cease aggrading and begin to
decay whereas adjacent, subaerial marsh sediments continue to aggrade and accumulate. As elsewhere, the
archeologically relevant deposits probably lie directly beneath (and may grade into) the twentieth-century marsh deposits. In the absence of a distinct stratigraphic or artifactual boundary it may be quite difficult to separate them. In
this case the contact is again perhaps as much as 1 m below

the current average high tide.
The northwest comer of Atkinson Island is clearly erosional. This is supported by the aerial photographs indicating the truncation or rounding off of this corner that has
occurred between 1982 and 1995 (see Figure 11). The primary cause of the accelerated erosion of this northwestern
corner, and the entire western shore of Atkinson Island, is
shipwakes produced by large vessels passing in the Houston Ship Channel. The power and character of this erosive
force was witnessed firsthand. A large ship passed Atkinson
Island, heading upstream toward Houston. The first waves
struck the western shore and were deflected northward along
it. These then merged with trailing waves traveling directly
northeastward. This "enhanced" wave rushed into and over
the northwestern corner of Atkinson Island, carrying a large
amount of sand and shell around the corner and along the
northern shore before a strong ebb tide moved some material northward into the Cedar Bayou Channel. Combined with
waves generated by ships traveling in the opposite direction toward Galveston Bay (which strike the shore directly

Chapter 6: Investigations at 41HR405, 41HR577, 41HR680, 41HR681, and 41HR685

from the northwest), these powerful forces are rapidly and
dramatically altering the Atkinson Island shoreline. Sand,
shell, and marshy sediments are being eroded, sorted, and
redeposited by size and weight along the northern shore
where a distinct lobe of beach sand and shell is building
progressively northward and eastward. The result is a transgressive, longshore beach accumulation whereby smaller
sand grains are carried farther, shell somewhat less far, and
large and heavier material (such as historic bricks and metal)
carried the least distance.
The model of landscape evolution and history envisioned here can be summarized as follows. It appears that
before Morgans Point was bisected in the 1870s, the peninsula east of that cut, although low, was for the most part
emergent land except for occasional periods of inundation.
This is suggested by several maps (e.g., see Figures 2 and 3)
as well as by a 1922 soil survey which shows the ground
surface as Harris clay (Geib et al. 1928). It is on this relatively
dry and stable surface that the historic occupations such as
Rightor's/Clopper's residence and the shipyard and buildings, were constructed. However, the onset of subsidence
related to development and expansion of the Goose Creek
oil field beginning in World War I caused the land to be more
frequently inundated whereupon the formerly emergent land
became progressively more marshy. Eventually, these marshy
conditions caused the development of an aggrading tidal
marsh. By this point, occupation and land-use had effectively ended on Atkinson Island, with the exception of occasional structures constructed on elevated madeland along
the western (Houston Ship Channel) shoreline.
As subsidence continued, the marsh continued to aggrade, keeping pace with subsidence. As the land sank, these
deposits were alternately exposed to shipwake and natural
wave erosion and to the deposition of a sealing but unstable
layer of sand and shell along a developing beach shoreline.
At the same time, the original shorelines of the emergent
island were lost to erosion and/or subsidence. Meanwhile,
the overall acreage of the island was dramatically increased
along the eastern side of the Houston Ship Channel as continued disposal of dredged sediment caused Atkinson Island to expand southward. However, the latter development
did not affect the 41 HR685 portion of the island except for
the localized deposition of dredged materials on the aggrading marsh sediments, especially along the northwestern and
western shorelines.
While this was occurring the intact, archeologically relevant deposits slipped beneath the water line while the natural deposition of sand and shell beach sediments or aggrading marsh continued to keep pace with subsidence. As erosion continued â¢. offshore sediments and artifacts were continually reworked back onto the beach and incorporated into
the beach deposits. Eventually, a storm- and tide-washed
shell "berm" (or perhaps a series of them) formed on the
back beach, separating the beach from the interior portion of
the island which became progressively more marshy.

67

Erosion appears to have intensified (or at least continued) along the western side of the island in the 1980's resulting in the truncation of the northwest corner seen today
(see Figure 11). As this situation progressed, recently aggrading marsh sediments that had been on the interior were
exposed and began eroding. At the same time, the existing,
older shell berm (see Figure 14b) was partially eroded. Waves
generated by passing ships in the Houston Ship Channel
reworked sand and shell deposits, including historic and
prehistoric artifacts from offshore, which began accumulating and spreading out northeastward into a lobe about 200
long along the north shore of Atkinson Island. Smaller grains
such as sand were carried progressively farther eastward
along the north shore. Meanwhile, the subsided historic
remains and sediments in the Cedar Bayou channel to the
north also continued to erode and were displaced southward to eventually become incorporated into the laterally
aggrading and shifting beach. In nearly all tests, the tan
sand became more gray with depth approaching the tidal
range. This is probably due to increasing moisture as well as
the presence of redistributed organic material derived from
the current and recently buried marshy deposits.
The pre-1918 historic surface has almost certainly subsided beneath the water line. However, wherever the shift to
aggrading marsh took place, this surface may be difficult to
differentiate from the overlying aggrading marsh sediments
in the absence of obviously intact diagnostic features or
artifacts. Any boundary between them is expected to be
gradual to diffuse. However, intact Harris clay sediments
should not have much decaying plant matter and may have
natural inclusions such as manganese nodules (e.g., Auger
Probe A3, see Appendix L) seen elsewhere in intact sediments along the San Jacinto River/Buffalo Bayou drainage.
An example is the apparently intact surface encountered in Auger Probe A3 at a depth of ca. 96.85 m, nearly a
meter below where organic-rich clays (lacking both Rangia
shell and manganese inclusions) were found farther south
in Shovel Probe 7/Auger Probe AS, Auger Probe A7, and
Shovel Probe 8 (see Figure 13b) between 97.93 and 97.79 m.
Organic clays similar to those observed in the latter three
tests were also found between 97.60 to 97.73 min Auger
Probes B3 and B4. Significant slopes of a meter or more over
such short distances are highly unlikely based on historic
and geomorphic evidence. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that these are in fact separate deposits and that the
lower one is the subsided pre-1918 surface. The upper one,
at or just above the water line, is instead buried, modern
marsh deposit. Given the presence of the marsh as a rough
guide for the water line, the absence of evidence for significant topographic relief, and the known amount of subsidence in the area coupled with the original ground surface
elevation, it is virtually assured that any deposits of archeological interest (i.e., intact prehistoric or historic surfaces)
are well beneath the water line.
In conclusion, shoreline changes resulting from widen-

68

ing of Morgans cut, subsidence related to the nearby Goose
Creek!Tabbs Bay oil field, and ongoing erosion have combined to erode and/or inundate the original land surfaces of
Atkinson Island. All artifacts recovered as a result of TARL
investigations at 41HR685, although consistent with the original definition of the site and the known historical occupations, were found in secondary contexts and many show
evidence of prolonged exposure to or erosion by water action. Intact prehistoric and historic remains now lie well below the water table and offshore in the current ship channels
that pass north and west of what remains of Atkinson Island. The deposit originally believed to be a prehistoric shell
midden defining site 41HR685 is actually a natural deposit
containing a mixture of redeposited prehistoric and historic
artifacts. The research potential of 41HR685 and Atkinson
Island is low in terms of further fieldwork, but additional
information from archival and historical sources may be available.

41HR681
Overview/Management Summary
Site 41HR681 is on Hog Island immediately across the
Cedar Bayou Channel from 41HR685 and was recorded as a
prehistoric midden in 1990 (TARL site file). Aerial photos
and historic maps clearly show that the southern end of Hog
Island did not originally extend this far south and that the
"site" lies entirely on madeland derived from channel
dredgings. This shoreline did not exist prior to the mid-1940s
(at the earliest), thereby ruling out the possibility of 41HR681
being an intact prehistoric archeological deposit. Pedestrian
survey and examination of natural cutbanks at this locality
by TARL yielded no prehistoric artifacts. All available evidence indicates that any prehistoric artifacts previously recovered at 41HR681 were secondarily deposited and that
their precise origin cannot be determined. Based on dredge
disposal patterns and erosional impacts observed on historic maps and aerial photos, it is likely that these artifacts
came from inundated cultural sediments within either the
main Houston Ship Channel or the Cedar Bayou Channel
segment. Finally, there is no evidence of historically significant or unusual historic components in the immediate site
area. The status of nearby historic structures are addressed
in separate reports (Hoyt et al. 1998; Schmidt and Foster

1997).
Previous Investigations and Historical Overview
Locality 41HR681 was reported in 1990 as part of the
Galveston Bay Archeological Inventory, undertaken by
members of the Houston Archeological Society. Site 41HR681
was recorded as a prehistoric Rangia midden extending along
the southern beach shore of Hog Island, directly across
from Atkinson Island (see Figure 1). It was reported to be
approximately 2,500 ft (ca. 750 m) long by 75 ft (ca. 25 m)
wide, and 1 m thick (TARL site files). Several oval deposits

of oyster shell (roughly 20 ft [6 m] by 10 ft [3 m]) overlay the
Rangia shell and were believed to represent later
Euroamerican use of the island. The site's recorder also noted
an oil well on the site which "is the most southern well in the
Goose Creek oil field" (TARL site file). No photographs were
made and no testing was done, but a small collection of
unincised Goose Creek plain pottery was reportedly taken.
It was initially believed that this "midden" (representing
multiple prehistoric occupations) was 50 percent intact and
potentially eligible for both State Archeological Landmark
and National Register of Historic Places status. Based on
this preliminary assessment, 41 HR681 was henceforth identified in planning documents as a potentially significant site
subject to future adverse impact, and therefore recommended
for reevaluation (Foster et al. 1993; Kibler et al. 1996). This
recommendation persisted despite the fact that cartographic
evidence compiled as early as 1993 (Foster et al. 1993 :Figure
16) clearly indicated that the southern portion of modern
Hog Island did not exist before ca. 1920.
In addition to the prehistoric site (41HR68 l), intensive
archival and cartographic research by Espey, Huston and
Associates, Inc. has identified a number of historic occupations and potential site localities. Ashbel Smith, a prominent
doctor, diplomat, soldier, educator, and planter (Silverthorne
1982, 1996), appears to have been the primary landowner of
Hog Island, beginning at least with a General Land Office
land grant issued to him on April 28, 1859 (Schmidt and
Foster 1997:79). However, Smith's residence was at Evergreen Plantation across Tabbs Bay, which he bought from
Captain Moseley Baker in the fall of 1847 (Silverthorne
1982: 112). He used the entire island to raise his eponymous
hogs and later cattle, perhaps as early as 1848 (Schmidt and
Foster 1997 :79; Silverthorne 1982: 118). Other identified nineteenth-century occupations of Hog Island include a ca. 1861
Confederate Army Camp (site 787-1), McGrafton's Landing
(787-2), and an Empty House (787-3) identified on an 1871
COE map (see Figure 3). Neither of the latter two structures
are shown on later maps, probably due to their destruction
in an 1875 hurricane (Schmidt and Foster 1997:82). As late as
1885, Ashbel Smith continued to run cattle on the island
(Silverthorne 1982:229).
By the early twentieth century, the island's primary use
had shifted to oil drilling and related activities. Humble Oil
and Refining Company purchased and developed pipelines,
storage tanks, and a wharf facility (Site 787-501; Benham
1996; Hoyt et al. 1998:100-101). Concurrently, a boardinghouse serving oilfield workers (site 787-201) operated on the
island between 1917 and 1920. During this time also, the size
of the island began to increase as a result of disposal of
dredge sediment along the Houston Ship Channel (see Geomorphology section below). Eventually, an artificial peninsula extending southward from the original island developed which served as an extension of State Highway 146,
which crossed Tabbs Bay to Hog Island via a trestle causeway (787-504; constructed in 1928). A ferry and landing (site
787-503) at the terminus ofthis peninsula is reported to have

Chapter 6: Investigations at 41HR405, 4IHR577, 41HR680, 41HR681, and 41HR685

begun operations in 1917 (Houston Post, August 12, 1976
cited in Hoyt et al. 1998:101), but this is unlikely given that a
1919 USGS topographic map (seeFigure6), surveyed in 1916,
shows only a discontinuous series of dredge mounds by
that time. Certainly, however, the ferry was established by
1930 (Hazelwood 1996) or 1935 at the latest when it first
appears on a War Department map (Schmidt and Foster
1997:84). The ferry was closed in 1952 (Tyler et al. 1996, but
see Schmidt and Foster 1997:84). Finally, the efforts of a
number of civic, government, and oil company interests culminated in the creation of Hog Island Park (site 787-502) in
1942.
With the exception of the ferry landing, highway extension, and park, all of these historic occupations and uses
took place on or near the original portion of Hog Island, well
away from the 41 HR681 area. In fact, the southern end of
what is now Hog Island did not exist much before the mid
1950s as discussed in the following section. Recent land
and underwater investigations by Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. indicate that the original peninsula and roadway/
ferry complex was well west of the modem shoreline within
the confines of the ship channel (Hoyt et al. 1998:Appendix
E).

What appear to be a small drilling platform, three storage tanks, and a service road occupied the madeland portion of southern Hog Island (behind the 41HR681 beach) as
early as 1956. These facilities apparently remained intact
until 1990 when 41HR681 was recorded (TARL site file), although they almost certainly were no longer operating. The
area is today very low and marshy, probably due to continued subsidence. No evidence of this or any other intact
structures were noted during either the TARL or Espey,
Huston and Associates, Inc. surveys in 1997, the latter covering the entire southern portion of Hog Island (Schmidt
and Foster 1997:98).

Geomorphology and Shoreline Reconstructions
The earliest detailed map of Upper Galveston Bay in
1851 (see Figure 2; Table 3 in Appendix A) clearly shows a
broad area of open water between Morgans Point and the
southern shore of what was then a much smaller Hog Island.
At this time, before Morgan's cut bisected the peninsula
and created a more direct opening to Galveston Bay (by
1876), the San Jacinto River-(after flowing generally southward between Spilmans and Hog Islands-turned southeastward (toward Cedar Bayou) and then again southward,
flowing around Morgans Point and crossing Clapper's Bar
before entering Upper Galveston Bay. As noted above,
Clapper's Bar was a significant impediment to navigation
and was the proximate reason for dredging Morgans Cut,
which effectively bypassed this obstruction and thus also
diverted (at least partially) the San Jacinto River.
A somewhat later U.S. Army Corps of Engineers map
(see Figure 3) drawn in 1871 is enigmatic regarding the size

69

of Hog Island. It appears that a large exposed bank extended
toward Morgans Point, although it is unclear whether this
bank was subaerially exposed or was only shallowly inundated. This observation was probably due to unusually low
water or tidal conditions at the time the area was surveyed.
Because this area was clearly open water (at least a few feet
deep) both before and after this time, and since no mechanism of uplift (other than dredging) is known in the project
area, it is safe to assume that this represents only abnormal
conditions and that the site area was probably submerged
much, if not all, of the time.
A new factor in the landscape evolution of Hog Island
appears to have begun by at least 1905 when a COE navigation map shows the first indications of what appear to be
artificial islands of dredged sediment along the edges of the
Houston (and perhaps Cedar Bayou) Ship Channel (see Figure 5). This continued such that, by 1919, a linear series of
conical mounds of dredged material up to 10 ft (ca. 3 m) in
height had been accumulated along the northeast side of
the channel, extending from the southwestern edge of Hog
Island and continuing toward Atkinson Island (see Figure
6). In fact, dredge material also appears to have been deposited along the southern and eastern edges of Hog Island by
1919; the natural, original portion of which is mainly tidal
marsh (see Table 3 in Appendix A). Note that this corresponds roughly to the beginning of the adjacent Goose Creek
Oil Field's increased production during World War I (Benham
1996;Hoytetal.1998:33).
By at least 1930, the individual mounds coalesced into a
continuous peninsula of dredged material that supported a
highway and ferry, and later a park (see Figure 7). Shipwakes
and other erosive forces gradually began reworking this sediment eastward so that by the mid 1950s (see Figure 8), an
emergent landform with an undulating topography with elevations of from less than 5 ft (1.5 m) to over 14 ft (4.5 m)
occupied the 41HR681 site area. Since that time, whatever
dredge disposal has taken place has been offset by continued subsidence and erosion, resulting in the marshy, partially flooded lowland observed since the early 1980s.
These various shoreline changes have been summarized on an overlay map (see Figure 11) that has been
georectified as outlined in Chapter 2 (cf. Foster et al. 1993:Figure 16; Schmidt and Foster 1997:Figure 6). Figure 11 clearly
shows that the landform occupied by 41HR681 is entirely
madeland. The 1851and1930 shorelines do not extend this
far south; the current southern beach shore was then open
water.

1997 TARL Investigations
Armed with this information, the TARL reassessment
of 41 HR681 was relatively brief, consisting of an afternoon
visit of several hours with the original recorder of the site.
This took place in June 1997 and consisted of a 100 percent
pedestrian survey of the beach shoreline as well as several

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

70

forays back into the low marshy interior. In addition, erosional cutbanks were cleaned and observed. The Rangia
shell deposit was somewhat smaller than originally reported
although it still occupied nearly the entire southern edge of
the island. All observations were entirely consistent with
the evidence from cartographic and photographic sources
that the locality is composed entirely of dredged clays and
recently deposited sand and shell.
No additional prehistoric artifacts were observed. Several large rusted metal pipes as well as smaller pieces of
unidentifiable metal were noted. A few large pieces of cut
wooden planks and beams were seen protruding from the
sandy marsh sediments. No evidence of the drilling platform
or associated storage tanks mentioned in the previous section were observed. On the beach, a large amount of modern
flotsam, including plastics, aluminum cans, fabrics, rubber,
etc. had accumulated.
The shell forebeach consisted of Rangia of various
sizes (many with periostracum still attached) as well as oysters and numerous other species of mussels and bivalves.
The backbeach shell deposits were largely the same heterogeneous mix, again dominated by Rangia, but distributed in
regular lobes, resulting in a scalloped pattern. Both shell
deposits are clearly natural accumulations and extend to (or
below) the water line as undifferentiated masses.
No evidence was found to support the earlier interpretations regarding prehistoric site type, integrity, or research
potential. The ceramic artifacts collected during the original
survey were not curated and were unavailable for study (C.
R. Ebersole and S. Kindall, personal communications 1997).
Nonetheless, their information potential is extremely limited.
While it seems reasonable that any artifacts found on the
beach were probably reworked from previously dredged or
recently eroded sediments from nearby in either the main
Houston or Cedar Bayou Ship Channels, they clearly were
in secondary context.
41HR680 (Spilmans Island)
Overview/Management Summary
Site 41HR680, originally recorded in 1990, is composed
entirely of redeposited shell and does not represent an intact prehistoric midden. No additional artifacts were recovered during the 1997 TARL investigations. Documentary
and cartographic evidence suggests that a single homestead
location was occupied on Spilmans Island beginning in 1830
and ending perhaps as late as 1900. Most of the island's
residents were probably tenants and the density and significance of historic remains (if any) would be modest.
Spilmans Island is today dominated by a large containment levee of dredged sediment that rings the north shore of
the island and acts as a retaining wall for dredge disposal
behind it, in what was formerly open water in San Jacinto
Bay. Despite a concerted effort by TARL personnel, no intact deposits were found along the north shore of Spilmans

Island, above or below the water table. Evidence from shoreline reconstructions clearly indicates significant loss during
the historic period and consequently, it is unlikely that intact prehistoric or nineteenth-century historic remains would
survive at this locality.

Previous Investigations and Historical Overview
Site 41HR680 was recorded in 1990 as a prehistoric
Rangia shell midden during the Galveston Bay Archeological Survey, undertaken by members of the Houston Archeological Society (TARL site file). It was reported to be a shell
midden nearly 800 m long, at least 6 to 15 m wide, and 1 m
thick, distributed along the north shore of Spilmans Island
(see Figure 1). The "midden" began about.5 mile east of the
southern footings for the Baytown-La Porte Bridge (State
Highway 146) along the right (southwest) bank of the Houston Ship Channel (Figure 15). The shells were reported to be
in a clay loam "at the edge of spoil area for ship channel
dredging" (TARL site file). The map overlays in Figure 15
are discussed in the Geomorphology and Shoreline Reconstruction section below.
Prehistoric Goose Creek plain sherds (unincised) and
some lithic material were reportedly collected from the site.
The sherds were noted to be "worn by wave action" (TARL
site file). Although a random surface collection was made
during the original survey, it was apparently not curated and
the artifacts were not available for reexamination by TARL
personnel. It was estimated that 50 percent of the site (as
defined) remained intact, but it was not considered a potential nominee for either State Archeological Landmark status
or for the National Register of Historic Places, although excavation by avocational archeologists was recommended.
No testing or excavations were performed during the original survey.
The island formerly was the right bank of the San Jacinto
River and was composed of two lobes oflandjoined at the
upstream (northwest) end of the island (see Figures 2 and 5).
A former San Jacinto River channel lay south of Spilman's
Island, forming San Jacinto Bay. Both the island and bay are
currently a dredge disposal area owned by the Port of Houston. Large levees of dredged sediment have been built up
along the northern and eastern shores of Spilman's Island to
enclose dredged material behind them; sediment has filled in
the formerly shallow bay (see Figure 5).
As with all of the localities in the project area, an understanding of the evolution of this landscape in order to assess the potential for encountering intact archeological deposits requires careful evaluation of the available documentary, cartographic, and aerial photographic evidence. Much
of the documentary and cartographic data have been presented in reports by Hoyt et al. (1998) and Schmidt and
Foster (1997). However, the evidence is treated somewhat
differently here and is supplemented by sources not included
in those reports. The interpretations reached independently

herein complement those found in these earlier studies.
Evidence of the location and character of historic occupations is largely known through nineteenth-century maps.
The following discussion is limited mainly to the information these maps contain regarding the cultural occupations,
not landscape changes (e.g., dredge disposal patterns and
the evidence for subsidence and erosion). Instead, the likelihood of site preservation based on map and photographic
information are discussed in the following section on geomorphology and shorelines.
Spilmans Island was named for James Spillman (occasionally Spellman) but has been spelled variously Spillman's,
Spillsman's, and more commonly on modem maps, Spilmans.
Except where reference is made to a specific map with a
spelling variant, the name "Spilmans Island" is used throughout this report. The island was originally granted to Henry
K. Lewis in 1830 (Hoyt et al. 1998:60). In the original survey
notes the island was observed to have low relief and fully a
third was reported to be low and marshy and unfit for cultivation. Its first occupant was apparently James H. Spillman,
a ship captain who settled the island in about 1830. Spillman
seems to have occupied a small area along the northern
shore, which based on hlstorical maps appears to have been
the same location used by all subsequent occupants as well.
The Overland brothers, George and John, who later owned
land along Mitchell Bay where they reportedly operated a
shipyard (Hoyt et al. 1998:90-91, 110), also boarded with
Spillman for a time. By 1835, Spillman bought the island from
Lewis's estate, and in 1839, his homestead was listed as an
official post office (Schmidt and Foster 1997:75). During this
time there is at least one reference to Sam Houston owning a
lot on Spilmans Island on which he apparently attempted to
plant a vineyard (Schmidt and Foster 1997:74-75), although
no additional evidence of sales of lots or partial interests in
the island are known. Another early resident on the Bay, C.
C. Cox (1902:129), provides some additional information on
the early occupation of the island:
Spillmans Island was just in front of our place.
It was the home of an old sea Captain from whom
the Island took its name. It was a landing place for
steamers passing up & down between Houston
and Galveston. It was a famous hunting ground for
Ducks & geese in the winter, the place was also an
occasional resort for "Old Sam" [presumably Sam
Houston]-as he was at that time familiarly called....
The Bay had some rare characters. This Capt.
Spillman, Dave Harris and John Morris, these 3
entered into a compact that when one died the other
two should gather around his bier, and with music
& wine, sing "Old Rosin the Bow"-and drink and
make glad the exit of the departed.
There does appear to be some confusion regarding
Captain James Spillman and James H. Spillman, who may
have been his son. Mrs. Dilue Harris reports that Captain
Spillman's son brought a boat to assist passengers stranded

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

at Morgans Point where the elder Spillman's schooner ran
aground on Clopper's Bar in April 1833 (Garrison 1900:8586). Also, James H. Spillman received 640 acres in 1838 for
"having been detached on special duty April 21st at San
Jacinto" (Dixon and Kemp 1932:456). In that same biographical entry he is noted to have emigrated to Texas in 1835 and
died in Galveston County in 1864, whereas Harris County
Probate Records (Schmidt and Foster 1997:75) indicate
Captain James Spillman died in 1840. Given the latter's apparent age, it appears likely that the James H. Spillman
appointed Postmaster in September 1839 (Schmidt and Foster 1997:75) was in fact the son of Captain Spillman. Additional archival investigations may further substantiate this
probable scenario.
Nonetheless, following James Spillman's death in 1840,
full ownership and partial interests in the island and its improvements were passed among a number of individuals
(Schmidt and Foster 1997:75). However, it is unclear whether
any of them actually occupied the island, since the single
structure included on a somewhat later 1851 (United States
Coast Survey) map (see Figure 2) is labeled "Spillman's"
despite his death more than 10 years earlier. Among the
known owners during this period are brothers Robert and
Henry Levenhagen, and Henry's wife, Frances (Hoyt et al.
1998:60). In 1843 "Spillman's Island" was designated an official polling place for a county election with Henry
Levenhagen acting as presiding officer (Looscan 1915:45).
This suggests that Henry and his wife, Frances, and perhaps Robert, who by that time held title to the island, occupied it at that time.
Following this, ownership of the island was finally consolidated again in Thomas Jefferson Jennings, an eminent
lawyer and Texas State Attorney General ( 1852-1856), state
representative, and member of the Secession Convention of
1861 (Williams and Barker 1943:266-267 [Volume 8]). Although
it has previously been stated that Jennings lived the San
Jacinto area until 1878 (Hoyt et al. 1998:61 ), it appears more
likely that the tax records on which this interpretation is
based more accurately represent a number of business interests in the Upper Galveston Bay area, including ownership
ofSpilman's Island. In 1858, the island was offered for sale
by the following description:
400 Acres, ofland, known as SPILMAN' S ISLAND, lying in the Bay of San Jacinto, ONE MILE
above Col. Morgan's. It is a fine place for a residence,- abounds in fish and fowls [sic], and is a
regular landing-place for the Galveston and Houston packets. For sale or exchange for up-country
lands. Title indisputable [Capitalization in original]
[de Cordova 1858: 122].
That Spilmans Island was identified as a regular stop
for commercial and/or passenger traffic suggests some degree of development or improvements to service this traffic
(e.g., a wharf or landing at a minimum) although precisely

Chapter 6: Investigations at 4/HR405, 4/HR577, 4/HR680, 4/HR68/, and 4/HR685

what those might have been are unknown.
Information from a biography of Thomas Jennings in
the collected writings of Sam Houston (Williams and Barker
1943:266-267 [Volume 8]) indicates that he never resided in
the area but instead lived in Nacogdoches, Tyler, and finally
Fort Worth where he died in 1881. The island remained in the
Jennings family until 1904 when it was sold to Frank J.
Kilpatrick whose heirs are reported to have sold it to the
United States Government for a ship channel right-of-way in
1907 (Hoyt et al. 1998:61 ). However, an undated (but likely
ca. 1960) Tobin oil field map of the island (enlarged by this
time through significant deposition of dredged material) on
file atTARL (41HR681 site file) shows what appears to be a
well near Spillman's former residence, owned by Crown Central Oil Co., and a long canal bisecting the southeastern
madeland portion of the island. Below this canal is a note
which states "Humble 0 & R Co. 1/2 Int, Eugenia K. Bray
and Ringland F. Kirkpatrick, 112 Int." This suggests that
only a portion of the island may have been sold for the rightof-way. Humble Oil and Refining Company paid taxes on 400
acres of the island between 1928 and 1950 (Schmidt and
Foster 1997:79).
It appears that only tenant farmers occupied the island
during the period of Jennings family ownership (1853-1904)
and that the primary use of the island during the nineteenth
century was for agricultural purposes, while in the twentieth
century, this shifted to nonresidential industrial uses such
as drilling and dredge disposal. The location of the residence area apparently shared by Spillman and later occupants of the island are largely known through historic nineteenth-century maps.
The earliest map showing the island in detail is the 1851
United States Coast Survey map showing "Spillman's" homestead located opposite the gap between Hog Island and the
unlabeled Blackwell Peninsula (see Figure 2). Note that no
island exists northwest of Spillman's Island at that time (see
discussion below in Geomorphology section). A later 1871
map drawn by the Corps of Engineers in response to the
River and Harbors Acts of 1870 (see Figure 3) shows a homestead, presumably in the same location, but labeled "Michael
Jannison" (not "Jennsion" as reported elsewhere [e.g.,
Schmidt and Foster 1997], although the island itself is given
as "Spillsman's [sic] Island." This was during the period of
Thomas J. Jennings's ownership of the island, andJannison
is most likely a tenant resident. It has been postulated that
Jennings himself may have occupied the island and that
"Jannison" (or "Jennison") may have been a misspelling
(Foster and Schmidt 1997:76). Hdwever, given Jennings social standing and apparent wealth, it is not likely that he or
his family would have lived in such modest circumstances
but rather in larger, grander accommodations similar to the
nearby plantation homes of James Morgan and Ashbel Smith.
Jennings' status as an absentee landowner is strengthened
by the contents of an 1873 letter he wrote from Fort Worth to
Ashbel Smith (the owner of Hog Island and a prominent

73

early resident) in which he relates a strong concern for the
"shell deposits" on the island, which "Texas" [presumably a
tenant, perhaps Jannison] was reportedly selling in violation of their contract (letter cited in Schmidt and Foster
1997:76). This of course also has obvious implications for
the potential preservation of prehistoric shell middens that
may once have existed on the island. Nevertheless, despite
Jennings's concern for the shell deposits, there are no indications that he was a frequent visitor to the island, perhaps
due to the lingering effects of an attack of paralysis in 1861
from which he reportedly never fully recovered (Williams
andBarker 1943:266-267 [Volume8]).
No structures are shown on "Spillman's Island" on an
1897 Corps of Engineers map of the ship channel, although
whether this is due to an omission by the surveyors is unclear. On the other hand, a 1905 Corps of Engineers map (see
Figure 5) may indicate a structure in the same location. Note
that the cultural features for the latter map were surveyed in
1898 (Hoyt et al. 1998:ix) and that the island is labeled
"Jennings." Schmidt and Foster (1997:112) report that improvements on the island were made following hurricanes in
both 1854 and 1875 but that the island was abandoned as a
residence after the deadly 1900 storm. The inference regarding occupation into the final years of the nineteenth century
is presumably based on the 1905 Corps of Engineers map
(see Figure 5).
No evidence of structures is seen on the 1920 USGS 7 .5'
topographic map (see Figure 6), surveyed in 1916, by which
time significant accumulation of dredged sediment was
spread linearly along the north shore of Spilmans Island. All
subsequent twentieth-century maps and aerial photographs
examined show only benchmarks and industrial features such
as drilling platforms. It appears that the only location where
historic remains might be expected would be in the immediate area of the Spillman/Jannison homestead locality on the
northern shore of the island, across from the gap roughly
between the Blackwell Peninsula and Hog Island.
Given that the first detailed topographic map of the island (see Figure 6) shows that it had very low relief and that
this mapping preceded the effects of subsidence caused by
the growth of the nearby Goose Creek oil field after this time,
it is highly unlikely that historic features still remain above
the water line (see discussion on Geomorphology and Shoreline Reconstructions). Note in particular the tremendous
subsidence of the Blackwell Peninsula in this century (compare Figures 5 and 10). Furthermore, eyewitness accounts of
the destruction wreaked by hurricanes on such lowlying
islands (e.g., Hog and Spilmans Island) cited in Schmidt and
Foster (1997) led them to conclude that any wooden structures, such as those expected on Spilmans Island, would not
have survived these storms intact.
There also seems to be some potential confusion related to the various names applied to this and another, largely
madeland, island to the northwest. Early maps such as the
1851 U.S. Coast Survey map (see Figure 2) do not show a

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

74

separate island northwest of Spilmans. The 1871 Corps of
Engineers map, which frequently used unique place names
not found on any other map (before or after), shows a separate small island labeled "Graf's Island" (see Figure 3). By
1897, an unnamed linear string of islands, some clearly shown
as conical mounds (presumably of dredge deposits) are indicated, which by 1905 (see Figure 5) have apparently coalesced and merged with the upstream end of Spilmans Island
(the entirety labeled here as Jennings Island). Later maps
and aerial photographs show "Jennings Island," separated
from Spilmans Island by a narrow channel (e.g., Figures 6
and 7). No structures are shown on Jennings Island. Shortly
thereafter, "Jenning's Island" appears to have finally merged
with Alexander Island farther upstream as the result of continued dredge disposal (see Figure 8).

Geomorphology and Shoreline Reconstructions
Evidence from cartographic and aerial photographic
sources dramatically document the combined destructive
effects of erosion, subsidence, and dredge disposal on potential cultural resources along the north shore of Spilmans
Island. A review of this evidence suggests little chance of
finding intact historic or prehistoric surfaces or remains at
41HR680. The original island was low and relatively marshy.
The close proximity of the Goose Creek Oil Field and the
resulting local subsidence suggest that surfaces predating
1918 are almost certainly now well below the current water
line. Furthermore, shipwake erosion along the northern shore
of the island has also contributed to significant shoreline
loss and continues to be a concern (as evidenced by the
recent deposition of riprap stabilization features as discussed
in the TARL fieldwork results section below). The original
1830 surveyors' notes for the Henry K. Lewis Grant state
that approximately one-third of the island was sea marsh
and unfit for cultivation. As mentioned, the 1851 U.S. Coast
Survey map (see Figure 2; Table 4 in Appendix A) shows
Spillman's residence near the eastern (downstream) end of
41HR680. It appears that Capt. Spillman built at the juncture
of higher ground fronting the San Jacinto River and bounded
on the east (downstream) by a narrow extension of low
ground (indicated by narrow lines) extending along the northeastern shoreline. Low, presumably marshy sediments characterized the eastern (downstream) end of the "northern arm"
of Spillman's Island, as well as the southern and eastern
portions of the "southern arm" and the interior shore of the
inlet produced by the merged arms (see Figure 2).
While the cross sections made during the 1870-1871
Corps of Engineers survey of the ship channel (see Figure 3)
were intended only to show the depth of inundated areas, it
appears from examining the sections past "Spillsman's Island" [sic], namely Nos. 142 to 149, that although the island
had fairly low-relief topography, it clearly had a bankline a
few feet high across most of the northwestern portion of the
island and was clearly an emergent landform. As mentioned,
this map also shows "Michael Jannison's" place roughly

where Spillman's had been earlier.
Although shown at a fairly small scale, the 1905 Corps
of Engineers map (see Figure 5) clear} y demonstrates that by
that time the dredge disposal had already made a significant
impact, as indicated by the expansion of what was "Graf's
Island" (cf. Figure 3) so that it merged with the upstream
(western) end of "Jennings" (a.k.a. Spilmans) Island. The
effects of redeposited sediment also seem to be represented
by a narrow, emergent downstream extension of the island
opposite Hog Island (see Figure 5). Nevertheless, nearly the
entire original extent of Spilmans Island is depicted as marsh,
suggesting a maximum elevation of no more than perhaps a
few feet. Note that only the apparent dredge disposal areas
appear to have elevations greater than the natural landforms
(cf. Figure 2). Remember also that this 1905 map was made
before the discovery and development of the nearby Goose
Creek oil field (Benham 1996) and thus predates the 6 to 8
feet of subsidence documented in the immediate area (Alperin
1977:231-232; Paine and Morton 1986). Given that the 1905
elevations are so low, it seems unlikely that nineteenth-century ground surfaces would now remain above water.
A 1919 USGS 7.5' topographic map (see Figure 6) further documents the simultaneous effect of both land formation (through dredge disposal) and loss (through erosion
and, especially here, subsidence). The north shore of
Spilmans Island is dominated at this time by a linear series of
conical mounds (5 ft or more in height) composed ofredeposited sediment, presumably dredged from the Houston
Ship Channel immediately adjacent to the island. This is also
true of"Jennings" island to the northwest. Note also that by
this time the connection between them had been breached
by a narrow inlet or pass to San Jacinto Bay and Brinson
Point. In addition to the effects of dredge accumulation,
subsidence is also indicated by the expansion of low, tidal
marsh areas, especially at the downstream ends of the two
"arms" of Spilmans Island as well as Jennings Island, Hog
Island, Alexander Island, and the unlabeled Blackwell Peninsula of Black Duck Bay immediately across from Spilmans
Island (see Figure 6). Nevertheless, although the subsidence observed by 1916 (when the survey for this map was
made) is significant, it was only after the onset of World War
I that the major expansion of the Goose Creek oil field took
place (Benham 1996; Hoyt et al. 1998:33). That development,
along with continued work on the ship channel (Alperin
1977; Sibley 1968), of course, only exacerbated these landaltering processes.
The continued deposition of dredged sediment and the
effects of erosion and subsidence (caused by the proximity
of both passing ships and the Goose Creek!fabbs Bay oil
field) are evident when comparing twentieth-century aerial
and topographic maps (e.g., Table 4 in Appendix A). The
maximum height of dredge material mounds is seen to cycle
back and forth as accumulation was offset by subsidence,
and vice versa. By the mid 1960s, Spilmans Island and San
Jacinto Bay had become a designated dredge disposal area
and a large levee enclosing the area was begun (see Figures

Chapter 6: Investigations at 41HR405, 4/HR577, 41HR680, 41HR681, and 41HR685

9 and 10). Although the levee and access road atop it was
essentially completed by 1982, it continues to be built up
and maintained (R. Gorini, J. Simmons Group, Inc., personal
communication 1998).
A georectified overlay of selected shoreline positions .
on Spilmans Island between 1930 and 1982 (see Figure 15)
indicates shoreline retreat of between 100 and 250 m during
this ca. 50-year span. Subsidence in the Baytown area has
been estimated at up to 8 ft (ca. 3 m) between 1920 and 1973
(Alperin 1977:231; Gabrysh and Coplin 1990). Combined with
the apparently modest relief of Spilmans Island in the late
nineteenth century and the proximity of the Spillman/
Jannison residence to the former shoreline, it seems almost
certain that this residence is now within the Houston Ship
Channel. Furthermore, any historical surfaces or remains related to that occupation are probably now either completely
eroded or inundated. However, even if they did survive they
would now most likely be buried by the massive dredge
deposits blanketing the island. Nonetheless, TARL fieldwork efforts (described in the next section) were directed
toward determining whether intact historical surfaces could
be found on or near the modem beach (which overlies what
used to be the northern "arm" of Spilmans Island; see Figure
15). An additional objective was to determine whether the
recorded prehistoric "site" (41HR680) on the beach was part
of the original landform, or, far more likely, was instead composed of (and found within) redeposited sediment.
Using the 1922 (Geib et al. 1928) Harris County soil survey map as a guide, the target sediment was believed to be a
Harris clay (or perhaps tidal marsh deposit). In either case,
intact sediments were presumed to be dark-colored, recently
deposited clays with only very weakly developed incipient
soil structure (Geib 1928: 1951).

1997 TARL Investigations
The "site" previously identified as 41HR680 was relocated and found to be a natural shell deposit. Included
with the shell was some low-density, redeposited cultural
material, as evidenced by a few scattered historic artifacts
found on the beach surface in 1997 and by the sherds and
lithics reportedly collected in 1990 when the site was originally recorded. Unfortunately, these earlier collections were
not available for reexamination.
A sand and shell beach forms the present shoreline of
Spilmans Island. This beach slopes gently toward the ship
channel and is variably exposed with the diurnal rising and
falling tides. Immediately behind the beach is a 1.5- to 2.5-mhigh shelf of dredged material that forms the modem bankline
or cutbank. In places this cutbank has been supported or
reinforced by large boulders deposited as riprap, especially
along the central and eastern area of the island investigated
by TARL (i.e., near the exposed location of the Spillman/
Jannison residence, across from the southeastern edge of
the Blackwell Peninsula levee). Landward of the dredged

75

cutbank, the ground surface is relatively flat, forming a bench
or terrace 25 m or more in width. This area is covered with
grasses and weeds, very dense in places but with only one
or two small bushy trees. This madeland is primarily clay
and forms deep, wide vertisolic cracks when dry.
The flat terrace then rises abruptly to a large levee or
retaining mound wall of dredge material that has been built
up to a height of nearly 10 m to enclose the dredge containment area farther south. A narrow, single-track dirt road winds
along the top of this levee. Landward of the levee, the ground
surface again drops off abruptly into the dredge holding
area which is partially filled. The redeposited sediment within
this holding area supports dense stands of weeds and grasses
as well as small patches of trees. Some standing water was
also noted within the containment area, although the base
elevation is more than 10 feet above mean sea level. This is
probably due to the impermeability of the clay.
This three-tiered aspect (in cross-section) of the modem ground surface at Spilmans Island is most pronounced
along the eastern and central portions of the island's ship
channel frontage (east of Transect A in Figure 16), before
the shore turns southeastward and continues towards
Barbours Cut (see Figure 1). The point where the shoreline
makes this tum is just beyond the likely location of any
remains of the Spillman/Jannison residence.
Nearer what is now the Baytown-La Porte Bridge (see
Figure 15) the three tiers merge into a single, more gradual
rise in elevation up to the levee road. Beneath the footings
of the bridge (i.e., the former entrance to the now-closed
Baytown Tunnel) is a lower area a few meters above mean
high tide that is now used as a construction and maintenance staging area.
The bankline, terrace, levee, and enclosed dredge disposal area are all man-made features. In no way do they
reflect the natural topography of Spilmans Island or the cutoff meander of the ancestral river, formerly known as the San
Jacinto Bay.
TARL investigations at Spilmans Island began with a
100 percent pedestrian survey of the sand and shell beach
along the northern shore of the island (well east of the site
limits shown on Figure 15). This began near the footings of
the Baytown Bridge and continued along the shoreline to
the point (roughly across from the northwestern tip of Hog
Island) where the modern shore curves southeastward before continuing on toward Barbours Cut (see Figure 1). The
survey was done at medium-low tide to allow for maximum
surface visibility. A large deposit of primarily Rangia shell
(clearly the same one recorded as 41HR680) was encountered along the western portion of this survey area (see
Figure 15). However, no prehistoric artifacts were found;
only modern trash and scattered fragments of brick and clear
glass were evident. Furthermore, the shell deposit included
a wide variety of shell species other than Rangia and oyster,
and many of the Rangia shells had periostracum adhering
to their outer surfaces, indicating a modern origin. Finally,

Chapter 6: Investigations at 41HR405, 41HR577, 41HR680, 41HR681, and 41HR685

the size classes of Rangia were quite variable and resembled
a natural assemblage.
The exposed, actively eroding bankline was examined
and found to consist of mottled clays of various colors (various shades and percentages of black, red, yellow, and gray).
The multiple colors reflect the mixing of distinctive facies of
Pleistocene Beaumont Formation and later Holocene sediments. The bankline deposits on Spilmans Island are clearly
redeposited dredge sediments, mixed with occasional fine,
discontinuous lenses of unsorted medium to coarse-grained
sand (see Bank Profile description below). No distinct lensing of shell within the dredge material was observed along
the bankline.
Between roughly Transect B and Bank Profile in Figure
16, the beach and bankline were obscured by a large, apparently rather recent deposit oflarge boulders, placed as riprap
to retard erosion. The shell deposit appeared to extend beneath these boulders, and based on the length of the site
provided on the original site form (ca . .5 mile) it appears that
the riprap does indeed cover a portion of the area recorded
as 41HR680. East of the rock apron, the beach is only a
narrow band of thin sand, suggesting greater erosion here
than nearer the Baytown Bridge. The riprap boulders are
primarily a uniform gray-colored dolomitic limestone that is
very hard and homogeneous. Thus, it conchoidally fractures and several fresh, large natural flakes of this material
were observed. These "pseudoflakes" were concentrated
around the boulders but had also been spread along the
shoreline in both directions from the main portion of the
riprap deposit.
Although it is not necessary to the conclusions reached
herein, it is possible that the lithic material previously reported from 41HR680 (which was again unavailable for study)
may have been composed of this allochthonous chert-like
stone. Several large flakes with single unfaceted platforms
and bulbs of percussion were found during the course of
TARL investigations. Even if the lithic material previously
identified is indeed cultural, it is likely that it was redeposited from offshore through natural erosion or dredging. In
any case, care should be taken when working in this area to
carefully discriminate between flakes of modern mechanical
origin and those from prehistoric contexts. For instance, the
type and size of the modern lithic pseudoflakes is very different from the gravels and gastroliths occurring naturally
on the raw-material-poor Upper Texas Coast (e.g., Aten
1983b:AppendixA; Patterson 1974).
Following the beach walkover and the preliminary examination of the dredge cutbank, four shovel probes were
laid out in the eastern (downstream) half of 41HR680 (see
Figure 16). The first three were located on the first "bench"
or shelf of dredged clay while the fourth was on an area of
exposed beach, east of the rock riprap deposit (which extends downstream only to near the area labeled Bank Profile
in Figure 16). The objective of excavating these shovel
probes was to determine the character of the subsurface

77

sediments and if intact, if prehistoric or historic surfaces still
exist below the dredged material, either above or below the
water line. Descriptions of the original Spilmans Island sediments (Geib et al. 1928) suggest that they were either Harris
clay or tidal marsh sediments, both of which were anticipated to be quite distinctive and easily differentiated from
overlying sand or mottled clays. In addition to the shovel
probes, a detailed examination was made of a cutbank profile
(Bank Profile in Figure 16) looking for any evidence of intact
sediments. The location of each probe and the bank profile
were recorded using the GPS apparatus. Descriptions of the
sediments encountered are shown in Appendix L.
Shovel Probes 1 through 3 encountered clays that were
even more dramatically mottled than were those in the
bankline. Scattered Rangia shell was observed within these
clays and no cultural remains were found with the exception
of bright orange paint on a fist-sized lump of clay and a large
piece of what appeared to be treated wood (perhaps a railroad tie) in Shovel Probe 3. The latter was found at 60 cm,
resting on mottled clays with lenses and pockets of sand.
Unfortunately, these sediments were extremely compact and
difficult to excavate which, working within the confines of a
hand-excavated test, limited the depths that could be reached.
The representatives of the current landowner, the Port of
Houston Authority, were reluctant to permit backhoe trenching of the levee base (R. Gorini, J. Simmons Group, Inc.,
personal communication 1997). Nonetheless, auger testing
eventually proved sufficient to demonstrate the absence of
intact archeological deposits above the water or within reasonable access. To at least the depths achieved, no intact
sediments (i.e., floodplain clays or marsh deposits) were
encountered, but these initial results were insufficient because of the limited depth of the tests.
The fourth shovel probe excavated (see Figure 16) was
located on the beach immediately below the cutbank. Here a
very thin lens of sand covered what appeared to be a rather
homogeneous deposit of reddish black to dark gray clay
that had recently slumped off the cutbank. It was hoped that
if intact sediments were found in this probe, a distinct
unconformity between them and the overlying dredged clays
could be identified and described. Unfortunately, the mottled
clay (which contained occasional lenses of Rangia shell)
continued to nearly a meter, gradually grading into more
sandy deposits (see Appendix L). Curiously, although the
shovel probe only appeared to be 20 to 30 cm above the
water line (visible less than about 5 m away), water was not
encountered in the probe until 90 cm below the beach surface. This is probably due to the lower permeability of the
dredged clays. In other words, this depth likely does not
represent the actual water level but rather the intersection of
the more permeable sand and the less permeable redeposited clays. Regardless, neither cultural remains nor evidence
of intact sediments were observed. The sand at the base of
the probe is probably not an intact surface. Although it is
possible that the historical Spilmans Island had a sandy

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

78

northern shoreline, the documented shoreline retreat (see
Figure 15) suggests that beach would now be within the
ship channel. Instead, based on historic maps and soil descriptions as outlined above, the interior of the island was
almost certainly Harris clays or tidal marsh sediments, which
were definitely not encountered in any of the shovel probes.
The bank profile was described from the surface (the
top of the profile) to the sand beach (ca. 1.2 m). Only widely
scattered Rangia shell, most of which appeared modern,
was observed in the section. As mentioned, this cutbank is
exposed just downstream from the rock riprap deposit and is
composed entirely of mottled clays. No cultural materials
were found.
Due mainly to the difficult digging conditions and limited depths obtained, definitive conclusions regarding the
existence of intact archeological surfaces could not be made
based solely on the evidence from these four probes and the
bank profile. In addition, while it was strongly suspected
that the shell beach recorded as 41HR680 was entirely composed of recently accumulated shell (although individual
shells may be older), no clear evidence had yet been gathered about the substrate on which this dep~sit lay. Therefo~e, a second phase of iesting was conducted, this time
using not only picks and shovels but also a large bucket
auger with a shaft extension.
Two auger test transects were laid out perpendicular to
the shoreline (labeled A and Bin Figure 16). The objective
was to start at the beach and continue progressively landward in a search for intact sediments and to allow for the
generation of a composite profile. Given the imprecision of
elevational data available from the GPS system, the locations and elevations of the probes were recorded using a
transit and were measured relative to an arbitrary (100.00m)
datum set along the access road on the top of the levee.
Locations were later tied into the UTM coordinate system
provided by the GPS equipment. The locations and surface
profiles of the two auger transects are given in Figure 17.
Note that the slope of the Transect A surface is more gradual
than is Transect B, which nicely shows the three tiers described earlier: the beach level rising up slightly to a "bench"
of hard, dredged clays that in turn rises steeply to the top of
the artificial levee.
The auger probes were begun as shovel probes. When
it became difficult to proceed, the augur was used, starting
at the base of the shovel probe and continuiing as deep as
possible. The sediments encountered in these auger tests
are described in Appendix L.
Auger Probe A-1 was placed on the sand and shell
beach along the Houston Ship Channel well within the
boundaries of the area defined as site 41HR680. Water was
encountered at only 25 cm below the surface, but the probe
was continued for another 70 cm, until slumping and saturation precluded going deeper. Demonstrating that the substrate of "site" 41HR680 is entirely sand reinforces the interpretation that it is not an intact archeological deposit. Fur-

thermore, that sand was found to a depth of nearly 1 m
strongly suggests that if any of the original Spilmans Island
sediments (e.g., Harris clay) remain, they are now well below
the water table. Two additional auger probes were also dug
on Transect A, somewhat farther inland on the bench or
shelf of dredged clay (see Figure 17). Auger Probe A-2 had
to be terminated due to large rocks encountered at only 30
cm below surface. Auger Probe A-3 on the other hand, attained a maximum depth of 1.5 m and penetrated what appears to be the same sandy deposit noted at the bottom of
Auger Probe A-1. While the elevation of the bottom of Auger Probe A-3 was ca. 30 cm above where water was encountered in A-1, the sands became increasingly wet with depth
and contributed to the slumping that halted testing at a depth
of 1.5 m below surface.
A second series of four probes was dug along Transect
B, approximately 200 m downstream from Transect A (see
Figure 16). Again beginning on the beach and continuing
inland, the sediments were found to be intermingled, heterogeneous deposits of mixed clays with interbedded lenses
and pockets of sand (see Appendix L ). Only scattered Rang ia
shell was noted and no cultural materials were found, with
the exception of a large wood fragment in Auger Probe B-4.
Water was encountered in Auger Probes B-1 and B-2 at
elevations between 92.30 and 92.00 m, nearly identical to the
level noted in Auger Probe A-1. Water encountered at higher
elevations (ca. 93.13 m) in Auger Probe B-4 probably represents a localized, perched water level related to drainage
from the elevated dredge disposal area on the opposite side
of the levee. In any case, this clearly does not reflect the
Houston Ship Channel water level. Nonetheless, further excavation in this probe was precluded by slumping caused
by wet, unstable coarse-grained sand.
Only in Auger Probe B-2 was a mixed sand and clay
deposit found that may may relate to the original historic
surface. However, this sediment was encountered nearly 0.5
m below the water line and no cultural material was recovered. At roughly the same elevation as the possible historic
surface, the probe had to be abandoned due to slumping.
Despite this tantalizing possibility, no unambiguous evidence
of intact archeological deposits was found along Transect

B.
In conclusion, the "site" recorded as 41HR680 is actually a modern accumulation that nevertheless may include
reworked prehistoric and historic cultural material. However,
artifacts recovered from these emergent deposits are definitely not in primary context. The combined, destructive effects of subsidence and erosion have resulted in significant
retreat of the northern shoreline of Spilmans Island (see Figure 15). Evidence from four shovel probes and seven combined shovel/auger probes demonstrates that no intact archeological surfaces exist above the water line in the site
area. In addition, no diagnostic nineteenth-century historic
artifacts related to the Spillman/Jannison occupations were
recovered during the 1997 investigations; only modern ma-

terial incorporated into the dredge deposits built up over the
last half century were found. The 41HR680 locality has little
if any archeological research potential. Specific recommendations regarding historical research, beyond those previously outlined by Hoyt et al. (1998) and Schmidt and Foster
(1997), are not appropriate here, but it seems likely that additional archival research could yield significant new information on the historic occupations and uses of Spilmans Island.
41HR405 (Goat Island)
Overview/Management Summary

Site 41HR405 was recorded in 1978 on Goat Island (a.k.a
St. Mary's Island) along the north side of the Houston Ship
Channel near Scott Bay (Hudson 1979) (see Figure 1). Although the initial survey recommended testing of the site, it
could not be rellocated during a follow-up survey five years
later by the same archeologists, who then concluded that it
had been completely eroded during the interim (Hudson
1983).
The difficulties in assessing archeological localities in
the project area are amply illustrated by 41HR405. In addition to the dynamic landscape transformations brought about
by erosion, subsidence, and human activities, cartographic
errors (i.e., using the same name for two different landforms)
initially complicated the TARL investigations, although the
problem was recognized and corrected during the fieldwork
phase. In short, the "Goat Island" on which site 41HR405
was recorded is wholly composed of dredge material deposited on the original left bank of the San Jacinto River, which
subsequently subsided beneath the water surface. Furthermore, the name of this madeland island was originally used
for a separate landmass that has completely subsided and/
or eroded.
The TARL survey team was unable to re-locate any
prehistoric cultural material on the island. The findings were
entirely consistent with the information derived from aerial
photographs and historic maps documenting the origin of
the "new" Goat Island. The locality was almost certainly
never an intact archeological site-the archeological materials recovered during the earlier investigations were probably redeposited from not too far away, from within the Houston Ship Channel during prior dredging operations. The only
documented use of the site locality, beginning ca. 1919 was
for dredge disposal-no historic occupation or other use of
the 41HR405 site area is known (and is highly unlikely given
its original low, marshy character).

Previous Investigations and Historical Overview
Site 41HR405 was recorded by personnel of Cultural
Resource Services, Inc. in May 1978 as part of a crude oil
pipeline survey (Hudson 1979). They reported an extensive
Rangia and oyster shell "washout" covering the eastern 80

percent of the island with a "clearly visible and distinct"
lens of apparently intact shell midden exposed in profile
nearthe water line (Hudson 1979:M-64). The site also yielded
three prehistoric ceramic sherds (two "red-clay-tempered"
and one "sand-tempered") and one unidentified bone fragment. Rangia, oyster, and unidentified "mussel shells" were
noted and samples taken. The site recorders also noted that
dredge material covered the entire site to a depth of 5 ft (ca.
1.5 m) and that the island was subjected to wave and
shipwake erosion (TARL site file). They further state that
"there are markers indicating that twenty-six (26) Exxon pipelines cross this island. It is also obvious that dredge spoil
has been deposited here, but a shell level is clearly visible at
the old beach level and the sherd collections were made on
original beach on the north [Scott Bay] side of the island."
The original site form on file at TARL also records the
soil type as "heavy orange clay" with a sandy beach. In
contrast, a 1922 Harris County soil survey (Geib et al. 1928)
recorded the entire left bank of the San Jacinto River in the
vicinity of 41HR405 as tidal marsh with small areas of
madeland. In the same survey, both Wooster Peninsula and
the original Goat Island (see below) are shown as Harris
clay. Both of these soil types are described as dark gray to
black, semideveloped soils associated with recently deposited sediments. The Harris clays are somewhat better drained
than the tidal marshes but were still subject to periodic overflow. The sediments described for 41HR405 suggest redeposited, highly oxidized Pleistocene Beaumont Formation
clays rather than intact, Late Holocene deposits typical of
archeological sites in the area.
A later revisit to the island in 1983 by the same archeological team that originally recorded the site was undertaken
to survey another proposed pipeline route (Hudson 1983).
This second survey was done during a period of extremely
low water levels due to a strong "norther." This exposed a
large concentration of shells on the northeastern side of the
island. This second reconnaissance included pedestrian
survey, shovel testing, testing with a 10-inch power auger,
and examination of exposed profiles and the adjacent flats
exposed by low water levels. The Scott Bay side of the island was described as erosional, while the Houston Ship
Channel side had recently been reinforced with steel bulkheads and riprap.
The site recorded in 1978 was not re-located during this
second survey; a result attributed to erosion and continued
subsidence (Hudson 1983). Auguring along the proposed
pipeline route yielded only sandy clay dredge material. Shell
was scattered on the surface but was not seen in the tested
deposits. The letter report concluded that the previously
recorded site (41HR405) had been destroyed by continued
erosion and that "the original site was probably northeast of
the present [1983] island in an area now submerged during
normal tide conditions" (Hudson 1983). The 1983 survey
also yielded two sherds and a small scraper from disturbed
contexts.

Chapter 6: Investigations at 41HR405, 41HR577, 41HR680, 41HR681, and 41HR685

Unfortunately the site file was never updated to reflect
this resurvey and consequently 41HR405 remained a candidate for further research. It was identified by Kibler et. al.
(1996) and Foster et al. (1993:C-9) as a potentially intact shell
midden. The 1983 letter report was cited by Foster et al.
(1993), who nonetheless conclude with the additional testing recommendation from 1979. Kibler et al. ( 1996: 158) identify 41HR405 as a Late Prehistoric site whose last known
condition was "disturbed" in 1979. Its present condition
was listed as "submerged," although the later Hudson (1983)
report was not cited.

Geomorphology and Shoreline Reconstructions
The earliest reasonably detailed map depicting the firstorder terrace of the San Jacinto River in the vicinity of
41HR405 was drafted by the Corps of Engineers in 1897
(Figure 18). The entire length of this peninsular deposit,
projecting downstream from Burnett Bay, is shown as marshy.
The more-detailed map produced by COE in 1905 (see Figure
5) clearly shows the left bank of the river as a uniformly low,
marshy area. Furthermore, north of this bank and separated
from it by a narrow reentrant channel to Crystal Lake is a
small peninsula (projecting eastward) forming the southwestern boundary of Scott Bay. A probable former extension of that peninsula is also shown. Although not labeled,
the latter is the original "Goat Island," and the. peninsula,
while not named on known maps, is referred to hereinafter as
the Wooster peninsula after the town that existed on the
western shores of Scott Bay after World War II before being
incorporated into Baytown sometime before 1966 (Beverly

1996).
By 1916, a few small mounds of redeposited dredge
material had begun to accumulate on the left (north) bank of
the San Jacinto River/Houston Ship Channel which otherwise remained a low tidal marsh (Figure 19). Wooster peninsula and Goat Island remain emergent landforms. The accumulation of dredge deposits on the north bank of the ship
channel had dramatically increased by 1930 (Figure 20).
Unvegetated, redeposited clays appear white on aerial photographs. Note the series of individual mounds and the coalesced areas of dredge material along the left bank of the
Houston Ship Channel by this time. Goat Island and the
Wooster Peninsula appear as vegetated, emergent landforms
on Figure 20. Observations of aerial photographs and topographic maps postdating Figure 20 are presented in Table 5
in Appendix A.
Two property maps produced by the Port of Houston
Authority (1949, 1963[1966rev.]) indicate the left bank of the
San Jacinto River was jointly owned by the San Jacinto Wharf
Co. (upstream) and the Trustees of John E. Green, Jr. (downstream) before the San Jacinto Wharf Co. later became the
sole owner. The latter map labels the north bank of the Houston Ship Channel as "Wooster Peninsula" despite the fact
this landform was never connected to the point of land oc-

81

cupied by the township of Wooster (Beverly 1996) nor even
apparently owned by any member of the Wooster family.
This is potentially misleading and should not be confused
with the use of the term "Wooster peninsula" in this report,
which is reserved only for that narrow spit ofland extending
from Wooster southeastward toward the original "Goat Island." Despite this, there is no evidence to indicate any
occupations or other use of the land than for the disposal of
dredged material (cf. Locality 44-301 in Foster et. al. 1993).
By the mid-1950s, considerable subsidence and erosion had reduced the size of the Wooster peninsula and
Goat Island. The 1955 La Porte 7.5' USGS topographic map
(Figure 21) shows two new madeland peninsulas (or "arms")
extending northward toward Scott Bay on either side of what
remained of Goat Island, presumably to create a dredge disposal area (see Table 5 in Appendix A).
The westernmost "arm" actually intersects the remaining portion of the original Goat Island which, along with
what remained of the Wooster peninsula, was indicated to
be tidal submerged land (dotted lines) on Figure 21. The
downstream (eastern) terminus of the San Jacinto River bank
deposit is now labeled St. Mary's Point. The left bank of the
San Jacinto River is shown with very irregular relief with
several indistinct mounds of dredge material forming mounds
and ridges up to 16 ft (ca. 4.8 m) high. Given the earlier
evidence for this being a uniformly low, marshy area (cf.
Figures 5 and 19) and Wooster peninsula/Goat Island being
well above the water line, this surely represents dredge disposal and subsidence with the strong likelihood that the
entire original land surface was then at or just beneath the
water line while all emergent land in the immediate area was
composed exclusively of dredged sediment.
Continued subsidence and erosion eventually resulted,
by the mid-1960s, in the almost complete disappearance of
the original "Goat Island" and all but a small portion of the
Wooster peninsula (Figure 22). This map for the first time
refers to the eroded remnants of dredge material originally
deposited on what was the north bank of the Houston Ship
Channel as "Goat Island." It was this map on which site
41HR405 was originally recorded; specifically, that portion
between the emergent western dredge "arm" and the partially submerged "St. Mary Point" (see Figure 22). Approximately 10 years later, the original landforms had completely
disappeared, so that only the upper portions of a few larger
dredge material mounds remained above water along the
north bank of the San Jacinto River. A 1975 TxDOT aerial
photograph and the 1982 USGS topographic map (surveyed
in 1976; Figure 23) are the best approximations of the new
"Goat Island" surveyed by Cultural Resource Services, Inc.
in 1978 (Hudson 1979). Note that the latter map (Figure 23)
also identifies eroding dredge mound remnants as the "Goat
Islands."
Finally, in the nearly 20 years between the time that
41HR405 was recorded and resurveyed shortly thereafter
(Hudson 1979, 1983) and the 1997 reassessment of the site by

TARL, continued erosion and subsidence have reduced the
dimensions of the "new" Goat Island from approximately 0.5
miles (ca. 0.8 km) by 0.15 miles (ca. 0.24 km) in 1978 to its
estimated present size of roughly 200 m by 50 m. This small
island is now referred to by representatives of its current owner,
Exxon Pipeline, Inc., by the more historically accurate name
"St. Mary's Island" (E. Snook, personal communication 1997).
It is currently used as an anchor point for pipelines crossing
Scott Bay and the ship channel. Continued use of the island
as a dredge disposal area is evident. The island is currently
dominatedÂ·by a large (ca. 5 m) pile of mottled dredged clays on
its western end. This mound is not seen in a photograph
taken in June 1994 by personnel from Espey, Huston and
Associates, Inc. (Hoyt et al. 1995:Figure 4).
These paleoshoreline changes have been summarized
on a single, georectified overlay map (Figure 24) produced
using methods outlined in Chapter 2. The dramatic landscape changes in the vicinity of site 41HR405 evidenced by

careful examination of aerial photographs and historic maps
amply illustrates the complex nature and dynamic environment of the Upper Texas Coast and Upper Galveston Bay
generally, and the bottomlands along the San Jacinto River/
Buffalo Bayou drainage(s) in particular. The value of conducting thorough background research as a first-order filter
for assessing the likelihood of finding intact archeological
deposits cannot be overemphasized. For example, had more
attention or consideration been paid to the 1983 Hudson
report, or if all of the available maps had been reviewed,
41HR405 might not have remained a research priority (e.g.,
Foster et al. 1993; Kibleretal.1996).
1997 TARL Investigations
Goat (St. Mary's) Island was surveyed by a three-person TARL crew on July 3, 1997. Investigations were limited
to a 100 percent pedestrian surface survey, the cleaning and

close examination of selected exposed cutbanks, and small,
informal probes. The results and observations of the TARL
survey were entirely consistent with cartographic and aerial
photographic evidence indicating that the site locality is a
relict dredge deposit. All exposed surfaces were found to be
mottled clay dredge materials which continued in all observed cutbanks down to (and beneath) the water line. Several "lenses" of broken and clearly redeposited shell were
observed in this dredged sediment. No evidence of any intact deposits and no cultural materials-other than modem
trash and occasional pieces of industrial metal fittings and
the like-were observed on the island.
An attempt was made to examine the artifacts, shells,
and single bone fragment collected during previous surveys (TARL site file) but they are not curated at TARL and
apparently are not available (K. Hudson, personal communication 1997). Regardless, these materials were almost certainly not in primary context.

Both the eastern and western ends of the island have
today been reinforced with stone riprap to retard erosion,
which despite these measures is evident in numerous
cutbanks on the ship channel side of the island. As mentioned, the island is currently dominated by a dredge spoil
mound nearly 5 m tall. Although the TARL survey team was
cautioned that not all existing pipelines were active or marked,
at least two dozen warning markers were observed, mainly at
the eastern end of the island.
In summary, the island on which site 41HR405 is recorded is composed entirely of dredge sediment. However,
some of the historic maps show a small area of slightly higher
elevation in the vicinity of where 41HR405 was later recorded
(see Figure 15). It is possible, though unlikely, that the upper
surface ofthis small area remained above water level in 1978
and then rapidly subsided so that by 1983, despite extensive
additional testing by the original recorders, 41HR405 could
not be relocated. Furthermore, the lack of intact deposits

above (or even just below) the water level in 1997, along
with the lack of additional artifacts, suggests that even if
this were true, whatever archeological surfaces did exist (if
any) are now completely submerged (and have since been
exposed to additional shipwake and wave erosion).
It is uncertain whether the originally recorded site was a
valid, intact archeological site. It is difficult to imagine that
the original low-lying tidal marsh bank deposits (e.g., see
Figure 5) were not eroded and/or inundated by 1975, especially given the degree of subsidence and shoreline change
noted for adjacent Wooster peninsula and Old Goat Island.
The early disposal of dredged sediments on this bankline
beginning in the 1920s artificially maintained the bankline

area as an emergent landform. The small, actively eroding
island on which 41HR405 was recorded is merely the remnant of previously deposited mounds and ridges of dredged
material. The sediment descriptions in the original site form
appear to be consistent with redeposited sediment rather
than intact archeological deposits.

work in 1997 (see Figure 1). Pedestrian survey of the beach,
examination of the spoil cutbank, auger probes, and two
shovel tests were conducted during the course of the TARL
investigations. Prehistoric sherds were recovered from within
this shell lens, but continued excavation revealed that the
"midden" also contained historic and modern artifacts and
was underlain by additional dredge spoil and sand. Further
probing on the beach also did not reach intact sediments.
Evidence from aerial photos and topographic maps indicate
that this was originally a low relief area subjected to considerable subsidence and which has also been blanketed by
thick, extensive dredge sediment deposits from the Houston
Ship Channel and Carpenters Bayou.
Based on this new information, the site is no longer
considered an intact prehistoric site but rather redeposited
shell (perhaps cultural) with a mix of modern, historic, and

prehistoric artifacts and materials such as wood. Prehistoric
artifacts recovered in this deposit are thoroughly mixed with
historic material, occur in low frequencies, and are in poor
condition. Deep testing well below the water line suggests
that no intact sediments or archeological surfaces are within
2 m or so of the modern beach. The immediate site area has
been subjected to considerable subsidence in the past and
continues to be impacted by erosion from shipwakes and
occasional storms and flood events. In addition, continuing navigational improvements to the channel (i.e., straightening and widening the main channel) have impacted the
site and surrounding areas. These forces have resulted in
the loss of nearly 100 m of shoreline, meaning that the original northwestern bank of Buffalo Bayou was, as late as
1930, well southeast of where it is now.
Note that this section deals only with the northwest

Neyland's four sites and the multicomponent historic site
(41HR576, also discovered by personnel from Heartfield,
Price and Greene, Inc. on this pipeline survey) are located
are treated separately in Chapter 7.

Previous Investigations and Historical Overview
Site 41HR577 was recorded in 1986 on the left (northwest) bank of Buffalo Bayou during a survey for the
Coastal Water Authority's Northwest Lateral Pipeline
(Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986). This 108-inch
water pipeline, completed in the early 1990s, now crosses
the Coastal Water Authority's property directly across
the Houston Ship Channel (near the area of 41HR121 re-

located and tested by TARL, see Chapter 7). The site was
reported to be a dense shell lens or "midden" roughly 20
to 30 cm thick and extending about 25 m along the bankline
(and covered by more than 3 m of dredge spoil) that was
actively eroding from the base of that bank, at or just
above the water line.
The 1986 survey yielded only a single small, heavily eroded
clay-tempered sherd and a turtle plastron fragment. They were
found on the beach in front of the dense Rangia shell lens with
sandy matrix out of which they were believed to have eroded.
Despite careful scrutiny of the area, only these two finds were
made. The paucity of artifactual and faunal material and the
sandy matrix was noted, but nevertheless, the shell lens was
defined and recorded as a prehistoric cultural site. The base of
the shell lens was reported to extend to the current sandy beach

surface, while its upper surface was presumed to represent the
original ground surface (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc.
1986:11). No clear boundary between the shell lens and the
surrounding sediment was noted.
Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. speculated that during the late 1950s when Neyland was documenting sites in
the area including the four on the opposite bank, the
41HR577 shell lens was completely buried by dredge overburden and that the site had since been re-exposed through
continued erosion and northwestward shoreline retreat
(TARL site file). However, after examining drilling log records
from geotechnical borings along the proposed pipeline
alignment, Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. (1986) expressed concern that the nearest borehole (C-lOIP) potentially contradicted his observation that the shell lens was
overlain by 3+ m of dredged material. This borehole re-

corded only silty sands from the surface to ca. 25 ft. (ca. 7.5
m). The boring was reportedly done on the artificially raised
upper surface of the dredged material. If instead it was dug
on the beach (or records were only kept after the drillers
cleared the redeposited clays) then the borehole data are
more consistent with both the 1986 and 1997 survey observations. In any case, TARL investigations (detailed below)
clearly determined that nearly 3.5 m of mottled, dense clays
overlie the shell deposit, which in turn lies on (and in) at
least 1.5 m of sand.
Although the site was judged to be potentially eligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, no
additional work was done because engineering specifications for pipeline construction called for a deep tunnel to
pass beneath the site and emerge only in a relatively small,
less than 18-ft-diameter, vertical shaft well back from the

bank.line. The limited potential of adverse impact resulted in
a recommendation for no additional work.
Historic land use in the immediate area of 41HR577 has
been lighter than at many of the sites considered thus far.
The site lies within the William J. Harris and David Carpenter
League originally granted on August 16, 1824 (Hartmann
1996;Hoytetal.1998:50). Theleaguewaspartitionedin 1829
with Harris retaining the southern portion fronting Buffalo
Bayou. The Lorenzo de Zavala homestead and cemetery
were located a short distance to the north, across Carpenters Bayou, as were various other historic and prehistoric
localities (e.g., Brandimarte 1982; Foster et al. 1993; Hoyt et
al. 1998 :50-55; Taylor 1985). A brick kiln and homestead were
located farther southwest (upstream) (Hoyt et al. 1998:55).
However, the primary use of the land fronting Buffalo Bayou
was presumably for stock raising and farming. There are no
indications of structures or other improvements in the imrne-

diate area except for two, small unidentified shoreline structures shown on the 1920 USGS Burnett Bay 7.5' topographic
map [surveyed in 1916] (see Figure 19). However, these structures do not appear on earlier or later maps and aerial photographs. Their purpose and the reason for their apparently
brief existence are unknown. They may have been destroyed
by military developments at the San Jacinto Ordnance Depot (41HR424) during World War II (Barcus 1996; Hoyt et al.
1998:54).

Geomorphology and Shoreline Reconstructions
Nineteenth-century maps of the left bank of Buffalo
Bayou in the vicinity of 41HR577 are consistent, if unremarkable. Surveys of the bayou and ship channel show this
as a low relief, locally marshy area adjacent to the thencurrent channel of Buffalo Bayou. These sediments presum-

Chapter 6: Investigations at 41HR405, 41HR577, 41HR680, 41HR681, and 41HR685

ably originated as a combination of alluvial deposition from
both Carpenters Bayou and Buffalo Bayou. Opposite the
channel was a broad terrace floodplain that probably built
northwestward over the last 2,000 or so years (see Chapter
7) as Buffalo Bayou cut progressively into the bankline in
the vicinity of 41HR577. Selected results from the examination of twentieth-century maps and aerial photographs have
been compiled in Table 6 in Appendix A.
By 1916 (see Figure 19) a series of small mounds of
dredged sediment are apparent along the northwest bank of
Buffalo Bayou. These are deposited on a lowland area no
more than 5 ft high. It has been suggested that these conical
mounds may represent intact shell middens or even a "hypothetical mound complex occupation" (Heartfield, Price and
Greene, Inc. 1986:13). However, given the known archeological record and their similarity to redeposited dredge material noted elsewhere along the Houston Ship Channel, this
speculation is implausible. The mounds in the vicinity of
41HR577 mapped in 1916 are, with near absolute certainty,
piles of dredged sediment.
Later aerial photographs and topographic maps document the continued deposition of dredge material on and
near the site area as well as the continuing erosion of the
bankline, forming a steep valley wall of artificial material. It
appears on a 1930 Tobin aerial photo that the shoreline was
a vegetated lowland fronting barren mounds of dredged
material to the northwest (see Figure 20, Appendix L). A
later (1956) Tobin aerial photograph suggests extensive
landfilling and reworking related to altering the course of
Carpenters Bayou. A georectified overlay map (Figure 25)
created using procedures outlined in Chapter 2 demonstrates
that the late-1950s realignment of Carpenters Bayou (cf. Figures 21 and 22) and straightening of the ship channel resulted in the loss of as much as 100 m of shoreline since
1930. By the mid-1970s the shoreline consisted only of a
steep embankment of madeland, separated from Buffalo
Bayou by a narrow sandy beach (e.g., Figure 23).
A relatively diverse and complex mix of soil types was
mapped in the area between Old River and Buffalo Bayou
during the 1922 Harris County soil survey (Geib et al. 1928).
However, in the immediate 41 HR577 area, the entire shoreline (roughly the same as the 1930 shoreline shown on Figure 25) is mapped as madeland, landward of which is a fairly
large area of Harris clay and tidal marsh sediments. Nothing
resembling either Harris clays or tidal marsh sediments (descriptions in Geib et al. 1928) were noted during the TARL
investigations (see below).
The modem shoreline at locality 41HR577 is subjected
daily to considerable erosive forces related to ship traffic in
the adjacent channel. Shipwakes vary in frequency and force
due to tides, ship speed, and various other factors. In addition, the relatively narrow confines, steep walls, and industrial development of the Buffalo Bayou segment of the Houston Ship Channel seem to result in the reverberation of wave
energy back and forth across the channel as witnessed dur-

89

ing the TARL investigations. Moreover, the wakes of passing
ships were observed to occasionally merge harmonically,
greatly increasing their amplitude. Taken together, the erosive
effects of ship traffic on the shoreline are considerable.
Land surface subsidence on the order of 8-9 ft has been
documented in the immediate area between 1906 and 1987
(Gabrysch and Coplin 1990; Chapter 2 this volume). Except
for those on the valley margin and upland, prehistoric sites
(especially along the bayou) are almost certainly now well
below the water line. Figure 5, dating to 1905,just before the
onset of the documented subsidence, shows a forested area
of slightly higher ground surrounded by marsh in the vicinity of 41HR577. Whether or not locality 41HR577 was a valid,
intact prehistoric site could not be determined using map
evidence alone.

1997 TARL Investigations
The area defined as 41HR577 was re-located in 1997 by
TARL personnel. The UTM coordinates on the shell lens
recorded by TARL using GPS deviated only about 2 m from
those originally reported in 1986 (see Figure 25a). In all respects the site looked the same as it was originally described:
a 20-30-cm-thick very well circumscribed, high-density lens
of Rangia and some oyster shell in a predominately sandy
matrix at the base of a large cutbank of redeposited, dredged
clays. The only significant difference was that the shell lens
extended only about 15 m along the shoreline rather than the
25-m length originally recorded in 1986. This suggests that
the locality and shell lens have eroded somewhat since the
site was first recorded in 1986.
As had been true in 1986, no distinct surface interface
or unconformity could be discerned between the shell and
either the beach or the overlying clay. Instead the Rangia
shell, despite being a distinct, homogeneous deposit, appeared to grade into the sediments above and below it.
A 100 percent pedestrian survey of the beach, especially concentrating in the immediate vicinity of the shell
lens, yielded no evidence of prehistoric artifacts. A single,
small fragment of burned bone was found near the northeastern edge of the shell lens and a great deal of modem
trash littered the beach. Because exposure of the shell lens
was limited to the cutbank profile, a safe but effective testing strategy had to be devised in order to assess the nature
of the deposit. The shell lens was clearly visible and accessible at the base of the steep but somewhat sloping cutbank
of dredge sediment that now forms the artificial northwestern "valley wall" of Buffalo Bayou. This ca. 3.5-m-high
bankline would allow some excavation (< 1 m or so) into the
cutbank without dangerously undercutting the wall or threatening its stability, and thus the shell deposit was tested by
means of two shovel tests excavated into the bankline (see
Figure 25b ).
Two shovel tests were excavated, one near each end of
the dense shell deposit. The tests measured 50-x-50 cm and

were spaced roughly 12 m apart. Shovel Test A was near the
northeastern (downstream) end while Shovel Test B was at
the opposite, southwestern (upstream) end (see Figure 25b).
The tests were placed so that excavation would begin just
above the shell lens (in the dredge sediment overburden)
and continue through the shell and beneath it in order to
observe stratigraphic contacts and relationships.
The positions of the shovel tests were recorded using
the GPS equipment. In addition, an arbitrary datum with an
elevation of 100.00 m was set on the upper surface of the
dredge material wall, along the small access road. Temporary
line level datums were set up at each shovel probe to tie the
elevations of the tests to the 100.00-m datum. Provenience
measurements were made using a combination of line level
measurements as well as direct vertical wall measurements
from known surface elevations.
Artifacts and bone were provenienced to excavation
level except where potentially diagnostic materials, such as
the pottery sherds, were noted in situ, in which case they
were mapped and point plotted. All of the sediment from
Shovel Test A was screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh,
while only the first and part of the second level in Shovel
Test B was screened. After it became apparent that this latter test was through a peripheral section of the shell lens,
the material was carefully troweled but not screened. The
shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm levels within natural
stratigraphic units. The results of these shovel tests are
given in Appendix L.
The first level in both shovel tests basically removed
the wedge of sloping redeposited clays overlying the shell
lens. However, after removing Level 1 and the first part of
Level 2 in Shovel Test B it became apparent that the shell
lens visible in profile at the upstream (southwestern) end of
41HR577 was ephemeral and represented the periphery of
the main shell concentration. Excavation then shifted to a
shovel probe methodology whereby the probe was still dug
by levels but carefully troweled through rather than
screened. Excavation of Shovel Test B continued to approximately 96.13 m when a layer of plastic pellets, styrofoam,
and wood was encountered at the base of Level 3. A small
probe, termed Level 4, was then dug which yielded more
sand and modern material. Additional augering revealed that
mottled clays and sand continued more than 1 m beneath
this point, to a depth of ca. 94.96 m (or more than 1.5 m below
the shell lens exposed in profile at this end of 41HR577).
Shovel Test B yielded no prehistoric artifacts.
In Shovel Test A, removal of Level 1 isolated a thick
deposit of the dense, ca. 25-cm-thick shell lens while Level 2
isolated and sampled this shell lens. However, in addition to
prehistoric sherds, historic and even modern artifacts were
recovered within this level, including metal, brick, and clear
glass fragments, as well as plastic and wood. Faunal remains
were mostly unidentifiable but included deer and Rock Dove.
In addition, the shell (mainly Rangia with some oyster) varied considerably in terms of size. Most significantly, the
matrix, although primarily sand, clearly included "pockets"

91

of mottled, redeposited clays. Level 3 removed the remainder of the shell deposit, which extended to the water line.
Continued augering, beginning at the base of Level 3, indicated a mix of mottled clays and sand continued to at least
94.67 m (ca. 120cm below the base of the shell lens).
Two additional auger probes were also dug farther
southeast on the beach, each 5 m from the two shovel
tests, and at an elevation inundated at high tide. These
results also demonstrated that a mix of mottled clay and
sand continued more than 1 m below surface. The sediments in these auger probes were also distinctly more gravelly (some up to 8 mm in size but mainly in the 1-3-mm
range). This suggests that the redeposited clays and sands
are intermixed here with fluvial deposits related to higher
energy deposition nearer the Buffalo Bayou channel. However, given the extent of shoreline retreat noted in the immediate area, it is likely that these fluvial deposits may be
relatively recent.
No evidence of Harris clay or tidal marsh sediments,
predicted for intact sediments based on the 1922 soil survey
map (Geib et al. 1928), were found in any of the probes or
tests. While it is tempting to speculate that the wood beams
and fragments found in Shovel Tests A and B are related to
the structures shown on the 1920 [1916] USGS topographic
map (see Figure 20), the clays and sand beneath them, as
well as the modern artifacts recovered nearby, supports instead a modern origin.
In conclusion, there are several lines of evidence suggesting that 41HR577 is not an intact prehistoric site but is
instead redeposited material that contains a mix of both historic (and some modern) and prehistoric artifacts. First is the
observation that the shell is within a sandy matrix with
mottled clay inclusions and that the substrate beneath it is
also mixed. Second is the low elevation of the original ground
surface coupled with the significant subsidence documented
in the immediate area. Third, the artifacts and bone occur in
very low frequencies and are in poor condition. For example,
all four sherds known from the site appear heavily eroded
and have rounded, rather than sharp, edges. Also, modem
and prehistoric artifacts are clearly mixed in the main portion
of the shell lens. It is inconceivabfo that postdepositional
intermixing of historic and prehistoric artifacts could leave
the shell accumulation intact. Instead, it seems much more
reasonable to conclude that the materials were mixed during
or shortly after deposition. However, it should be noted that
the cultural materials and shell were probably redeposited
from now inundated areas only a short distance away in the
adjacent Buffalo Bayou ship channel segment. Because it
was not possible to test farther to the northwest due to the
thickness of dredged material overlying the original ground
surface (which has probably subsided beneath the water
line), intact archeological remains cannot be ruled out there.
However, even if such sites do exist, they are not subject to
adverse impact from the planned navigational improvements.
The only "site" in jeopardy, 41HR577, is not an intact prehistoric site.

CHAPTER7

PAST AND PRESENT INVESTIGATIONS OF THE
SOUTHEAST (RIGHT) BANK OF BUFFALO BAYOU

This chapter discusses investigations at sites along
the shoreline and adjacent upland on the southeastern (right)
bank of Buffalo Bayou, immediately upstream from the San
Jacinto Battleground State Park. Four Late Prehistoric shell
midden sites (41HR33, 41HR104, 41HR105, and41HR121)
were recorded along the eroding shoreline in the late 1950s
by Wayne B. Neyland. He also recorded two additional prehistoric sites (41HR122 and 41HR123) on the adjacent upland margin, on either side of a large gully, and noted the
presence of concrete foundations, structures, and historic
artifacts on the upland above sites 41HR33 and 41HR121.
The latter were eventually recorded by R. Moore (Heartfield,
Price and Greene, Inc. 1986) as historic site 41HR576. TARL
investigations included fieldwork to attempt to relocate the
four bankline midden sites and the analysis of relevant materials and documentation in the Neyland Collection. During
the course of that research, an intact remnant portion of
41HR121 was discovered on the valley slope and upland
margin, which was the subject of intensive testing in the
summer of 1997 as well as the following spring. It is possible
that all or part of site 41HR122 lies along one edge of the
thin, buried shell midden at 41HR121. Finally, a portion of at
least one component of historic site 41HR576 partially overlaps and overlies the upslope extension of 41HR121. Archival and historical research suggests that 41HR576 may include additional components related to early Texas historical events such as the Runaway Scrape and Battle of San
Jacinto and/or early-twentieth-century light industry or commercial usage.
This chapter is subdivided into three major sections.
The first recounts Neyland's investigations at these sites
between 1957 and 1959. This is followed by an overview of
recent TARL analyses of the documents, maps, photographs,
artifacts, and related remains in the Neyland Collection, the
overwhelming majority of which comes from 41 HR33. An
interpretation of the original locations, stratigraphy, cultural
occupations, and ultimate fate of these sites concludes this
first section.

The second part of Chapter 7 presents an overview of
the current landscape and geomorphology of this section of
the project area followed by a description of initial TARL
survey efforts in the summer of 1997 along the modern beach
and shoreline as well as upland areas. The results of TARL
subsurface and geomorphological investigations are then
integrated with data from historical maps and aerial photographs in order to assess the likelihood that any of the four
bankline sites, as originally defined, might now exist either
above or below the beach and water line. Potential occupational components of historic site 41HR576 are then briefly
reviewed. Discovery and definition of the buried upslope
remnant of site 41HR121 and its relationship to 41HR576 is
then discussed. The third section describes TARL's advanced testing at these sites in 1998. Results of the field and
laboratory research are synthesized in anticipation of the
significance assessments and recommendations presented
in Chapter 8. Finally, the relationship(s) of 41HR33 and
41HR121 to each other and to similar sites in the Galveston
Bay area and the Upper Texas Coast are also explored as part
of this evaluation.

The sites discussed in this section were all reported
and investigated between March 1957 and December 1959
by the late Wayne B. Neyland. His efforts resulted in a very
large collection of artifacts, photographs, and documents
including several notebooks or journals (see Appendix N).
These data have been housed at TARL since the 1960s and
have not been previously published or systematically examined. The probable locations of the four bankline sites, as
well as the most likely location of another (41HR122), are
shown on Figure 26. Note that the locations are well away
from the 1986 bankline and instead lie on the 1956 shoreline.
This difference has undoubtedly been the cause of much
confusion. These locations differ from those on file at TARL

and elsewhere, which are plotted on a 1982 USGS 7 .5' topographic map and the shorelines indicated there. The updated positions in Figure 26 are based on careful examination ofNeyland's notebook entries and photographs as well
as historic shoreline reconstructions and are believed to
more accurately represent the sites in their original, late 1950s
locations. Current landowners and property boundaries
mentioned in the text are also provided.
All four shell midden sites were contained in what appears to be interfingered alluvial and colluvial deposits along
the inner margin of a wide floodplain terrace that formerly
flanked Buffalo Bayou (hereafter, the Buffalo Bayou alluvium). The term alluvium is used here to denote a mix of
fluvial and colluvial material. The Neyland sites were originally found nearer the Buffalo Bayou channel suggesting a
greater alluvial contribution. Nonetheless, headward cutting gullies and bayous such as Tucker Bayou could contribute substantial amounts of material from the upper valley
margin. The two other sites (41HR122 and 41HR123) were
recorded on the upland margin on either side of large gully
that was probably an arm of Tucker Bayou. Erosion, primarily due to shipwakes, exposed the shoreline sites intermittently along the bank, although it is possible that all could
have been considered a single, laterally extensive and variable archeological site.
The first and largest site Neyland recorded was 41HR33
(originally designated Houston Ship Channel Site 4, or
HSC#4). It was a large, composite shell midden (consisting
of multiple individual lenses) found to be rapidly eroding
along the bankline and yielding a large amount of cultural
material. Figure 27 shows the thickness of shell deposits
and the general site area, including the rather gentle, wooded
slope behind the site. It is important to note that this is not
the valley margin. Due to continued erosion, this late 1950s
bankline was considerably farther out (perhaps as much as
100 m) than is the current cutbank. Site 41HR33 was located
several hundred yards from the "western" (actually southwestern) edge of San Jacinto Battlefield State Park and its
associated bulkhead fronting Buffalo Bayou. It was this site
that was the primary focus of Neyland's subsequent salvage and excavation efforts and yielded the largest artifact
collections. As stipulated in the scope of work for the current project, the materials from 41HR33 and the other bankline
and upland sites have been inventoried and at least basic,
preliminary analyses conducted (discussed below and in
appendices). The full potential of these collections, particularly the ceramics, has not been realized.
Sites 41HR104 (HSC#5) and 41HR105 (HSC#6) were
subsequently recorded nearer the San Jacinto Battlefield
State Park bulkhead on either side of a large bluff composed
of Beaumont Formation material (Figure 28a). By the time
Neyland recorded these small shell-bearing sites they had
already been virtually destroyed and later entries state that
both were completely eroded (or possibly subsided) by the
time he concluded his investigations in December 1959 (see

95

Appendix N). Site 41HR104 was only evidenced by a small,
diffuse area of Rangia shell exposed in silty clay sediments
on the beach at the "western" (upstream) end of the bluff
(Figure 28b ). Accelerated erosion just outside the state park
(in the vicinity of the Houston Lighting and Power right-ofway; see Figure 26) appears to have been caused by the
construction of the bulkheading in the 1940s. It presumably
deflected and focused wave energy against that bankline,
removing an originally narrow deposit of Buffalo Bayou alluvium and quickly undermining and exposing Pleistocene
Beaumont Formation sediments. The latter bluffline still exists, although it too has retreated somewhat due to continued erosion since that time.
Site 41HR105, as originally recorded by Neyland, did
not extend into the park. Figure 29 shows two views of the
site area defined by Neyland beneath the moss-covered tree
outside of the bulkhead. Later augering by TARL using a
Giddings rig in April 1998 (Figure 30) encountered what are
believed to be a very small sliver of equivalent (i.e., potentially cultural) sediments inset against a natural levee or upland projection extending into the park, toward the Battleship Texas. The sediment is, however, deeply buried by concrete and other fill sediments (note the void behind the bulkhead and the erosional bluffline in both photographs in Figure 29). Recent modification of the planned navigational improvements avoids the park area, making further investigations of these sediments unnecessary at this time. Photographs and a careful reading of Neyland's notes demonstrates that 41HR105 is clearly not within the boundaries of
the San Jacinto Battleground (41HR277), a State Archeological Landmark and National Register of Historic Places
site. Treatment of the prehistoric site as a subarea of the
battleground (e.g., 41HR105[277] in Kibler et al. 1996) is
clearly a misconception. The site's listing as a historic trash
deposit is similarly unsupported by the original definition
(Kibleretal.1996:163).
Upstream from 41HR33, Neyland also noted one or more
thin Rangia shell lens( es) exposed intermittently along the
bankline for several hundred feet. This was recorded as
41HR121 (HSC#7) and had as its downstream boundary an
ill-defined transition zone between it and 41HR33. This
boundary was based almost entirely on decreasing shell
and artifact densities just west of the area shown in Figure
27a. Neyland did not recognize any archeological materials
on the valley slope adjacent to these four sites, but he did
note and photograph several historic footings and foundations on the upland above 41HR33 and 4lHR121 (Figure 31 ).
These distinctive concrete and shellcrete features were later
recorded as 41HR576 (discussed below) and aided TARL in
determining more precisely where these four sites were located. In addition to these four sites, Neyland also recorded
twoothers-41HR122(HSC#8)and41HR123(HSC#9)-at
the junction of the valley margin lip and headward cutting
gullies that may be related to the former Tucker's Bayou
drainage. Site 41HR121 was said to be bordered on the west

(upstream) by a small gully while 41HR122 was somewhat
fartherupstream on the eastern (downstream) edge of a larger
gully. The former site was described as "a distinct knoll created by the underlying deposit of losse, friable shell and
dark, black soil" (February 8, 1959 notes, see Appendix N).
Although the site contained shell, the knoll-like aspect is
reminiscent of earth midden sites (cf. McGuff and Ford 1974).
It is very possible that the knoll observed by Neyland is on
the upland edge of the buried upslope midden defined and
tested by TARL as 41HR121.
Neyland's division of the archeological material along
the right bank of Buffalo Bayou into discrete sites was arbitrary to a certain degree and conditioned primarily by different rates of erosion over small lateral distances. Aerial photographs and shoreline overlays suggest that construction

of the park bulkhead combined with increased channelization
of and traffic on the Houston Ship Channel caused the rapid
erosion of the extensive Buffalo Bayou alluvium terrace.
Therefore, the four bankline sites could be considered a
single locality with multiple, overlapping prehistoric occupations that resulted in laterally discontinuous shell lens( es)
of variable thickness. Neyland clearly focused his efforts on
the main cultural accumulation at site 41HR33; investigations at the other sites went little beyond simple recording
and the collection of a handful of artifacts.
Neyland discovered and began collecting artifacts from
41HR33 (HSC#4) on March 30, 1957 (see Appendix N). The
site was a large Ceramic period shell midden exposed along
roughly 100 ft (ca. 30+ m) ofbankline. Distinct lenses could
be observed in portions of the site (see Figure 27), which

was rapidly eroding due to heavy ship traffic in the channel. A large number of recently exposed artifacts were also
found eroding out of the cutbank and scattered on the
beach fronting the bankline. The beach was sandy in some
areas while in others it was a truncated clay deposit (con-

taining shell) at or just below the water line (Figure 32).
Over the next two years, Neyland returned to the site dozens of times to collect artifacts and to conduct limited excavations. The Neyland collection from 41HR33 contains ceramics, lithics, ground stones, bone artifacts, fauna! remains, macrobotanical remains, sediment samples, shell
samples, and miscellaneous artifacts. Analysis of the materials from 41HR33 and the other Neyland sites are detailed in the appendices to this report.
At first, Neyland maintained a rough measure of provenience control by identifying loci of apparent high artifact
density such as Areas 1, 2, and 3. However, he soon realized
the size and extent of the site-and the rapidity with which it
was eroding-and established a 5-x-5 ft grid to maintain
some provenience controls over his collecting and later excavations (Figure 33). He also identified several areas he
believed to be cultural features such as "Fire Pits" 1 and 2.
Virtually all of the 41HR33 bone and artifacts have some
provenience information written in black ink directly on them
by Neyland.
Unfortunately, a number of problems or shortcomings
limit the quality of provenience information from site 41HR33.
Datum stakes were often trampled by cattle grazing on the
property and high tides also uprooted them. They had to be
reset several times which probably introduced some error
(see Appendix N). More critically, no vertical (or elevational)
standard was established. Instead depth was calculated from
the top of the shell lens in each unit, regardless of its relative
thickness or the amount of overburden. In addition, for both
horizontal and vertical proveniences, overlapping ranges
were often used. For example, some sherds are provenienced
to 0 to 6" below the top of the shell lens while others were
labeled 0 to 10". Designations indicating Square E0-5' and
E0-1 O' (or "areas" within them) were also used. This lack of
vertical control limits interpretation of stratigraphic relationships within the midden although artifacts recovered from
the overlying "black clay" stratum can be confidently considered to postdate shell accumulation. While the provenience information available is frequently sufficient to determine relative stratigraphic relationships, it is difficult to
project across multiple units given the lensing and undulation of the shell deposits. On the whole horizontal provenience information is much better controlled than are
elevational data although in both dimensions much ambiguity often remains.
The reconstructed stratigraphy at 41HR33 appears to
closely resemble that encountered by TARL at41HR121 (discussed in greater detail below) and appears to apply equally
well to the other three south bank sites recorded by Neyland.
His notes and photographs from 41HR33 indicate that the
shell lenses and primary cultural deposits were confined to
the lower half of a dark silty clay the BSC or "black silty
clay" sediment described at 41HR121 that unconformably
overlay a yellowish brown clay facies of the Beaumont Formation (see Figure 32). In some places the shell lenses were

FIGURE 32. Neyland photograph of 41HR33 taken May 6, 1957
showing relationship of eroding Rangia shell lens(es) at the base of
dark silty clay (Buffalo Bayou alluvium) above lighter, Beaumont
Formation sediments. Although most of the shell scattered on the
beach in the foreground appears to have been eroded and reworked,
elsewhere relict patches of in-situ shell were exposed by removal
of overlying sediments. The photograph is of the eroding bankline
between ca. E30' and E55' looking roughly eastward (see Figure
33).

separated from the yellow clay by several inches of the same
dark silty clay whereas in others, this underlying sediment
was thinner or nearly absent (see Figure 27). Where erosion
had proceeded to a greater degree, the shell was either exposed at the surface or covered by a much thinner layer of
silty clay. Much of the site was also covered by a blanket of
recently deposited alluvial sand or a loose humic (presumably colluvial) sediment. Several photographs show the earliest shell deposit near the western (upstream) end of the
site to be a very thin lens lying almost directly on Pleistocene sediments and separated from the overlying lens( es)
by as much as several centimeters of dark silty clay. This
agrees well with the situation observed by TARL at the
nearby upslope extension of 41HR121.
Neyland 's efforts at 41HR33 and the other bankline sites
are recorded in all or part of four separate notebooks over a
two-year period, ending in the spring of 1959. Annotated
entries from these notebooks are provided in Appendix N.
By that time, erosion due to shipwakes and storms had
caused the bank to retreat up to ca. 20 m and most of the site
to be lost. The photographs in Figure 34, which show the
same tree stump in May 1957 and then less than two years
later in January 1959, illustrate the rapidity ofthis erosion.
Near the end, few artifacts and little shell were seen in the
bankline, but remnants were visible at or just below the water line (Figure 35a). Neyland began excavating through the
new sandy beach deposits at low tide to access the remaining lower portions of the main shell lenses and associated
artifacts (Figure 35b). Unfortunately, he soon encountered
the water line and was frequently swamped by the wakes of
passing ships. However, Ney land's experiences suggest that
while the upper part of the site was being truncated and

eroded, subsidence was also acting to lower the entire area.
Some of these cultural deposits were probably preserved
below the modern water line. As reported in the following
section, the 1997 TARL investigations demonstrated con-

elusively that none of these deposits now remain above the
waterline.

collection pertaining to these south bank sites include 187

black and white photographs and 45 color slides (see Appendix N), a large collection of artifacts and bone from
41HR33, and much smaller artifact collections from 41HR104,
41HR121, and 41HR122. Artifacts in the 41HR33 collection
include 2,380 pottery sherds (mainly sandy-paste Goose
Creek types [see Appendix D]), lithic tools (including projectile points) and debitage (see Appendix C), and other
miscellaneous cultural material including ground stones,
ocher, macrobotanical remains (seeds and charcoal fragments), and asphaltum (see Appendix M) . If refitted sherds
are instead counted individually, the number grows to 2,553
(see Appendix D). In addition, a large amount of bone (mainly
deer but including several other taxa such as turtle, fish, and
rabbit) was recovered (see Appendix G). The faunal material
includes the remains of domestic pig (Sus scrofa), although
remarkably few historic artifacts were noted or collected.
Prehistoric bone artifacts, including hollow points, awls,
needles/punches, and spatulae were also recovered (see
Appendix E).
The prehistoric ceramic sherds from 41HR33 have been
refitted or apportioned into 40 partial vessels and vessel
sets (cf. Gadus and Howard 1990), ranging in size from 1 to
205 individual sherds. Of the 40 identified thus far, 27 were
identified and reconstructed by Neyland. The remaining 13
were recognized and reconstructed during the course of a
cursory inventory undertaken by TARL (see Appendix D).
It is highly likely that more refits to existing and/or as-yetundefined vessels may be found in the over 1,300 loose
sherds remaining in the 41HR33 collection. The variety of
proveniences represented in some vessel sets, and even
within a single refitted piece, suggests that eroded artifacts
were rapidly reworked on the beach or that broken pots were
widely dispersed prior to burial (see Appendix D).

Most of the artifacts were surface collected. In the few
instances where excavated sediment was screened, it was
through only 112-inch mesh. Neyland's notes and the collections themselves suggest that the collection criteria were
highly selective and biased toward sherds, larger bones,
and lithic objects. The effects of such bias is, however, less
pronounced for some artifact classes than others. For example, the ceramics are probably fairly representive, and
both the vessel and loose sherd collections are extraordinarily homogeneous. Nearly 95 percent (n=2,257 of2,380 total)
of the ceramic material is undecorated sandy-paste wares
classified as Goose Creek Plain or untyped. Only 3.7 percent
(n=88) of the assemblage is decorated Goose Creek wares.
All other ceramic types, including early wares such as O'Neal
Plain, Mandeville, or Goose Creek, var. Anahuac, as well as
later grog-tempered pottery (Aten 1983a), each comprise less
than 0.5 percent of the total. The only two vessel sections
with grog tempering (Vessels 21 and C) and a single grogtempered base, were recovered slightly above the shell in
the dark silty clay, suggesting that they postdate the occupations related to the shell accumulations. On the other hand,
lithic debitage and bone are almost certainly
underrepresented, judging from the notes and also from the
greater number and variety of these materials from excavated (and screened) units.
One remarkable aspect of the 41HR33 ceramic collection is the large amount of repair evident on both sherds and
vessels. Clay patching and mending holes are found on many
vessels and individual sherds. This finding may have important ramifications for understanding the adoption and use
of pottery by native hunter-gatherers in the Galveston Bay
area and Upper Texas Coast (see Appendix D; Hood 1998).
Another notable finding was what may be a previously

Chapter 7: Past and Present Investigations of the Southeast (Right) Bank of Buffalo Bayou

unknown or at least undefined ceramic variety or type in the
Galveston Bay area. Vessels 19 and 22 (and perhaps Vessel
26) are distinctly banded with vertical (perpendicular to the
rim) areas of red or orange separated from darker (possibly
burnished) areas by a straight well-defined line (see Appendix D). In one case, the orange coloration appears to be
caused by intense oxidation while the .other has traces of a
red pigment or paint adhering to the surface. The adjacent
darker areas appear reduced and burnished. The possible
significance of this decorative technique is unknown, but
the colors red and black are believed to have had some symbolic or ritual meaning to Karankawan peoples (Aten
1983a:75). Regardless, the orientation of banding and distinct, straight borders certainly appears intentional.
As mentioned, Neyland's investigations at the other
sites were cursory and consisted mainly of description and
the collection of small quantities of artifacts. Five prehistoric sherds and some bone were collected from 4IHR104 as
were two sherds from 41HR122 (see Appendix D). The collections also include historic artifacts originally assigned to
4lHR121, including a cocktail fork, ironstone hotelware, and
a tubular light bulb (see Appendix F). It is curious that although Neyland clearly defines 41HR121 as a prehistoric
bankline shell midden, the artifacts he collected (and labeled)
were historic and were almost certainly recovered farther
back on the valley slope or upland margin. However, the
clear association between these materials and the San Jacinto
Inn dumping component of 41 HR576 (discussed below) supports the interpretation that the shell lens isolated by TARL
in 1997-1998 is in fact an upslope extension of 41HR121.
To summarize, Neyland was witness to the very rapid
erosion and subsidence of archeological deposits along the
southeast (right) bankline of Buffalo Bayou. Over an approximately two-and-a-half year period these sites (as originally defined) were largely, if not completely, destroyed or
inundated. Fortunately, his efforts to salvage as much as
possible (primarily from site 41HR33) during this period resulted in the retrieval of a large collection of fairly wellprovenienced cultural material as well as extensive notes
and photographs that are an invaluable record of sites and
conditions that no longer exist. Neyland's description and
documentation of the 41HR33 deposits, as well as the provenience of refitted sherds and the recovery of grog-tempered vessels above the main shell deposit, indicate that
41HR33 was intact.
TARLINVESTIGATIONS OFTHESOUfHEAST
(RIGHT)BANKOFBUFFALOBAYOU
Due to the extent of TARL investigations along the
southeastern bank of Buffalo Bayou and also to landscape
changes that are alternately familiar and unique, the structure of the following section differs somewhat from that used
in Chapter 6. Previous investigations have already been
outlined in this and previous chapters. Historical occupa-

101

tions and land use are deferred temporarily in order to accompany the discussion of site 41HR576. The section instead begins with a discussion of the modern geomorphology and documented historical shoreline changes. However, more emphasis is placed on the former rather than the
latter. This is due in part to the straightforward evidence for
significant erosion of Buffalo Bayou alluvium floodplain and
colluvial sediments up to (and partly into) the valley margin
of Pleistocene sediments. Moreover, detailed consideration
of more localized alterations, such as the recent emplacement of a 108-inch water line and the filling in of a significant
portion of Tucker's Bayou, are perhaps more effectively and
appropriately dealt with individually. Emphasis herein is not
on reproducing a series of historical maps and aerial photographs with commentary. Due in part to the proximity of the
San Jacinto Battleground State Park and associated historical interest, there is far too much material to comprehensively present and discuss all. Instead, historical maps and
aerial photographs are used sparingly and only when necessary to effectively make specific points. All of the sources,
maps, and photographs consulted are referenced to facilitate future research. Following the discussion of the modern
geomorphology and shoreline changes, TARL survey and
testing investigations are presented.
Geomorphology and Shoreline Reconstructions
The now-familiar nexus of subsidence, erosion, and
development are equally significant in this portion of the
project area as it was in others. Effects of shipwake erosion
within the confines of a narrow valley are particularly significant. Local subsidence on the order of 8 to 9 ft in lower
Buffalo Bayou has been documented between 1906 and 1987
(Gabrysch and Coplin 1990) with most occurring since 1943
(Gabrysch and Bonnet 1975). However, this short segment
of Buffalo Bayou shoreline, between the confluence of the
San Jacinto River with Buffalo Bayou and the northeastern
corner of Paktank property (Figure 26) is fortuitously among
the least developed areas along the ship channel. This is, of
course, partly due to the state park but also to the limited
use of the upland in the CWA Valve Station No. 1 property
for cattle grazing and other similarly low-impact uses since
at least the 1930s. Historical aerial photographs and maps
clearly indicate significant shoreline loss and channel widening during the same time period. A georectified overlay of
three shorelines is provided on Figure 26. Sources consulted
by the project geomorphologist and comments on specific
shoreline changes have been tabulated. The first, Table 7 in
Appendix B, applies to sites 41HR33 and 41HR121 farther
along the upstream edges of the roughly triangular wedge
of Buffalo Bayou alluvium sediments that remained in 1956.
The second, Table 8 in Appendix B, combines observations
on sites 41HR104 and 41HR105, on either side of the steep
erosional bluffline nearer the San Jacinto Park. It should be
noted that these observations were originally made using

placed on the 1982, rather than 1956 bankline. Nonetheless,
the observations are generally applicable along the entire
shoreline segment, if not for the specific localities.
The earliest detailed topographic map available for this
general area is the 1920 (surveyed 1916) USGS Burnett Bay
7.5', 1-ft contour projection shown on Figure 36. This map
predates most if not all of the effects of local subsidence and
the period of most extensive widening and deepening of the
Houston Ship Channel, most of which took place after World
War I (e.g., Alperin 1977; Sibley 1968). The approximate locations of the major property boundaries on Figure 26 have
been added to this historic map. It is apparent to anyone
who has visited this area that much has changed since that
time. For example, the rather significant bayou that heads
along the intersection of the 30-ft contour line and what is
now Highway 134 (the straight, vertical roadway on Figure
36) has apparently been largely filled in. Along Buffalo
Bayou, a "finger" or narrow projection of higher ground
extends into the park between the western edge of this small
bayou and the Buffalo Bayou valley margin. This is probably composed of uneroded Beaumont Formation sediments,
although some levee/overbank contribution cannot be ruled
out. This shelf then drops down to a lower area bounded on
the east by a curving roadway and a small lake or
empoundment (cf. Cartier and Hole 1972) and marsh beyond
that. This lower emergent land then continues around the
marsh before terminating at the Lynchburg Ferry with a
sideroad to what was formerly the de Zavala ferry (Hoyt et
al.1998).
In the area now within the CWA and Houston Light &
Power properties, the projection of higher ground widens
southward (see Figure 36). A broad floodplain terrace (Buffalo Bayou alluvium) fronts the steep bluff which gradually
curves southward and becomes less steep. This is clearly
associated with one or more side drainages or gullies related
to the Tuckers Bayou drainage. At least one of these drainages empties directly into Buffalo Bayou. It was the erosion
of this floodplain that exposed the archeological deposits
defined as the four bankline shell middens by Neyland in the
late 1950s. The upland margin sites he defined (including
41HR122 and 41HR123) were reportedly on either side of a
fairly large gully, perhaps one of the more gently sloping,
but wider, side drainages somewhat farther south along the
bluffline, although it is unlikely that Neyland was referring
to the narrow, directly draining small bayou. The likelihood
that the thin, buried remnant of 41HR121 tested by TARL
lies along a gently curving slope of one of these side drainages is also supported by subsurface testing. Development
has, however, obscured surficial evidence of this. Sediment
dredged from a large dock on Paktank property in the 1970s
(see 1986 shoreline on Figure 26) was redeposited on the
upland to artificially raise and level a platform for chemical
holding tanks which now extend nearly to the Paktank/CWA

property boundary (L. Kopecky, Paktank, Inc., personal communication, 1997). In addition, emplacement of the CWA
108-inch water line in the late 1980s was also accompanied
by some filling and redeposition of dredged or excavated
sediment along the upland (discussed in greater detail below).
The modern setting between the San Jacinto Battlefield
State Park and the northeastern corner of Paktank, Inc. property (Figure 37) is a product of the twentieth-century forces
that have shaped this segment of Bufffalo Bayou. While
this area is relatively undisturbed in terms of industrial development and facilities, natural and cultural forces have
altered the original landforms and are therefore important
controls on the potential for intact, buried archeological deposits. In general the basic geomorphology of this area is
very similar that described by Paine ( 1987, 1990) at the nearby
Peggy Lake Disposal Area.
Beginning just outside of the San Jacinto Battlefield
State Park boundary and bulkheading, along the powerline
right-of-way owned by Houston Light and Power, the valley
wall is a very steep, erosional landform over 6 m high (see
Figure 37). Local subsidence has clearly lowered the maximum height of the upland (cf. Figures 28 and 29), but it
remains a significant landform. Beaumont Formation clays
and sands are exposed in profile down to the water line and
are capped by a deep, well-developed Lake Charles series
soil (Wheeler 1976). At its base is a narrow, sandy beach
that directly abuts this valley wall and gently slopes northwestward toward the opposite bank for an unknown distance underwater. The sandy beach is low and inundated at
high tide. Construction of the original San Jacinto Battlefield State Park bulkhead in the 1940s is believed to have
deflected and focused wave energy of this area. Aerial photo graphs and maps clearly show the development of a
"scooped out" erosional face by at least the mid 1950s (see
Figure 26). Neyland's sites 41HR104 and 41HR105 were at
either end of this bluff. Concrete blocks have been added as
riprap to retard the continuing erosion below ihe Houston
Light & Power large tranmission tower stanchions.
No Buffalo Bayou alluvium sediments are found above
the water line. Moreover, there is little chance of any surviving beneath the water given the rapid onset of erosion and
the relatively narrow deposit of Buffalo Bayou alluvium. Interestingly, the park bulkhead may have have preserved a
narrow sliver of Buffalo Bayou alluvium against the valley
wall just within the park itself. Most of the sediment behind
the bulkhead is fill, creating a flat grassy, picnic area. In 1998
TARL personnel drilled a few deep auger holes on the level,
grassy area behind the seawall using a truck-mounted
Giddings drill rig (see Figure 30). Deeply buried sediments
believed to be intact Buffalo Bayou alluvial/colluvial deposits were encountered, although no cultural material was
found. These sediments are at or just above the water line
against the narrow projection of upland or natural levee,
which dips perceptibly to the northeast here due to localized

subsidence near Lynchburg. Areas within the park should
not be adversely affected by proposed ship channel modifications, so no additional work is recommended at the present
time.
Upstream of the boundary between the powerline rightof-way and CWA property, the valley wall gradually becomes less steep and the bankline decreases in height. This
trend is primarily due to decreasing effects of erosion of the
valley wall itself as one moves upstream, as shown on the
generalized profiles in Figure 38. Figure 38a shows what is
believed to have been the original sedimentary cross-section at the bluff area just described as well as the predominant situation as it remains farther upstream. A drape or skirt
of colluvial material melds near the valley margin with original terrace deposits dating to the Late Holocene or possibly
historic periods. Intensive erosion of the bluff (Figure 38b)
removes the colluvium from all but the upland edge, the
bluff retreats, and a new modem beach is formed. There is
therefore virtually no chance of the survival of intact Late
Prehistoric archeological deposits where erosion has proceeded to this degree.
As the valley wall grade begins to lessen upstream, the
sandy beach widens and is accompanied by a proliferation
of vegetation (and the flotsam it nets) along the base of the
valley wall. Both the remaining colluvial slope and beach
support dense undergrowth and, in the former case, trees.
Nevertheless, erosion clearly continues to predominate here
as well. Beaumont clays and sands are exposed in profile,
with little or no colluvium extending downslope as far as the
bankline. The area below the cutbank remains sandy. As
indicated in the following section, no prehistoric artifacts or
intact archeological deposits above the water line were found
in subsurface tests. The sand is more than 1.5 m thick in
places and everywhere extends down to and past the water
line except where it directly overlies sloping Beaumont deposits.
The grade of the bluffline continues to decrease upstream to a narrow gully (see Figure 37) which contains an
abundance of early- to mid-twentieth-century historic artifacts and apparently was used as a dump by the San Jacinto
Inn (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986; Hoyt et al.
1998:77). The depth and extent of Holocene colluvium increases on the valley slope as its grade decreases and is for
the first time exposed in profile near this gully. However,
close examination of these cutbank sections revealed no
cultural material or Rangia shell. The beach immediately
below the bankline is sand. No intact Buffalo Bayou alluvium sediments were found. It should be noted that a distinctive round or circular structure of reinforced concrete is
located on the upper valley margin, about 40 m downstream
from this gully (see Figure 31). Neyland photographed this
same structure in 1959 and noted that it was "above" 41HRl21.
If so, the steeper portion of the valley margin just described
would seem to include the entire area of what was once
41HR33, as well as 41HR105 and 41HR104 (see Figure 26).

105

Based on the surface and subsurface findings, it is clear that
no portion of these sites remains above water. It is likely,
however, based on Neyland's notes and TARL testing (described below), that some surviving cultural strata may be
inundated or deeply buried by sand.
Beach sediments near the gully appear to be slightly
more silty nearer the bankline due to the influx of some redeposited upland sediments, but this effect is not pronounced.
Again, no prehistoric artifacts were found on the surface or
in the probes.
Just upstream of the gully, the slope continues to become less steep. Darker Holocene sediments are still relatively thin and discontinuous in profile but appear to thicken
upstream. Where these black silty clays first noticeably
thicken along the bankline, a single prehistoric sandy-paste
sherd was discovered lying on the sand surface just below
the bankline. It and additional artifacts found nearby led to
the discovery of the upslope extension of site 41HR121 on
the valley slope which became the focus of later TARL investigations. However, no intact sediments were found above
the water line in subsurface tests on the beach below the
bankline. In fact, aside from the few sherds and Rangia shells,
little evidence of the site's existence could be seen on the
beach or bankline or even on the slope itself. Only a small
portion of the slope had been eroded down to the cultural
deposits and resulted in the downslope displacement of the
artifacts. This is fortunate both in terms of simply finding
such an easily overlooked small site and also in the limited
disturbance to the site itself.
Upstream of 41HR121, between it and the Paktank property line (see Figure 37), the valley margin slope becomes
even less steep and eventually grades into a relatively continuous profile lacking a well-defined cutbank or bluff top.
The 108-inch water main that crosses the CWA property
before crossing beneath Buffalo Bayou was emplaced within
the last decade. This has resulted in the clearing of what was
previously very dense vegetation on the upland and slope
(cf. Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986). Examination of
preconstruction plans (provided courtesy of the contractors, Brown and Root, Inc.) reveals that the route of the
water line did not significantly alter the slope itself but may
have been designed to take advantage of the existing relief.
Redeposited clays (presumably Beaumont) from the trenching and other digging apparently have been spread on this
slope and nearby upland. The winding area of lighter color
(lacking trees) evident on the 1986 aerial photograph (see
Figure 26) appears to correspond to the clay deposits observed on the upland by TARL. The clay was deposited
prior to the emplacement of the water line and was used as
an access road across the often-wet, marshy upland
(Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986).
This grassy area is the most gently sloping portion of
the valley margin. Later subsurface tests revealed that the
modem surface and immediate (< 1 m) subsurface are redeposited Pleistocene clays, perhaps from the dredging of a

Pleistocene Beaumont Formation sediments. Less advanced erosion farther upstream on the CWA property has preserved a relatively
thin, intact deposit of colluvial sandy clays With Late Prehistoric archeological remains on the valley slope (41HR121) although the alluvial
sediments below the bankline have been entirely eroded or subsided.

large docking facility on adjacent Paktank property (L.
Kopecky, Paktank, Inc., personal communication 1997). Very
large amounts of fill were used to to build up the northern
comer of Paktank property in the 1970s for the construction
oflarge chemical holding tanks (see Figures 26 and 37). Historical topographic maps (e.g., Figure 36) indicate that the
southwestern end of CWA property and the northeastern
comer of Paktank, may have been the sides of a small gully
associated with Tuckers Bayou that apparently has been
wholly or partially filled in. Previous probing and magnetometer survey along the water line route in 1986 yielded
only scattered twentieth-century historic artifacts (Heartfield,
Price and Greene, Inc. 1986, 1987). No archeological deposits were found on this slope during TARL testing. The water
line and the development of the Paktank property effectively
preclude any possibility of finding or accessing intact Holocene deposits at the southwestern end of the project area.
It is possible, however, that intact prehistoric sites may be
deeply buried farther southeast, on the upland well back
from the valley margin (see discussion below on 41HR121
testing).
Figure 39 is a photograph showing the entire extent of
the area just discussed, taken from a ship dock at Paktank.
On the far left is the Battleship Texas and the San Jacinto
State Park. The steep erosional bluff is inset against the
valley wall immediately below the large Houston Light &
Power powerline transmission tower. Farther upstream, the
wooded slope gradually becomes less steep until the wooded
bankline in front of the open grassy area is but a gentle
slope (beyond the mooring platform at center-right). The
artificially raised corner of Paktank property is visible at right.
Other than the grassy area, the upland supports two or
three lobes of dense second-growth trees encircled by open,
grassy lanes or work areas related to CWA maintainence
and construction. Many of the grassy areas appear to have
been built up by a relatively thin mantle (ca. 0.5 to 1.0 m
thick) of dredged clays. The forest stands thus occupy lower
ground, which is marshy and held several inches of standing water during much of the spring of 1998. Most of the
concrete foundations and footings recorded as 41HR576 are
obscured within the treeline north and east of the trashfilled gully. The Houston Light & Power large powerline area
is open with only scattered trees. A much smaller powerline
(or possibly telephone line) right-of-way and access road
parallels the upland margin. It runs from the open grassy
area at the southwestern end of CWA property to near the
stanchions of the large Houston Light & Power tower (see
Figure 39). Site 41HR121 lies just inside the wooded valley
margin and slope west of this smaller powerline. A nail in
one of the wooden poles along this line, at its southern end
where it opens into the broad open grassy area, served as
the arbitrary NlOO/ElOO site datum for 41HR121 before a
permanent site datum was established in April 1998.
To summarize, the lower portion of the southeast valley

107

wall of Buffalo Bayou is essentially bounded at either end
by areas of extensive erosion (downstream) and industrial
development and large-scale landscape modification (such
as infilling). As the severity of the slope lessens, colluvial
deposits thicken. Only within a narrow segment of the valley margin, between the trash-filled small gully and the edge
of the grassy, infilled area and water line right-of-way, is
there an increased probability of preserved archeological
remains. As discussed below, this is indeed where a thin,
buried shell midden (site 41HR121) was discovered and
tested by TARL. There is little if any chance of finding other
prehistoric archeological remains above the water line along
this portion of Buffalo Bayou, except perhaps on the upland
itself or well back from the valley margin and deeply buried.
TARL 1997 Survey
Prior to fieldwork, TARL personnel were aware from
Neyland's notes and aerial photographs of the rapid and
extensive twentieth-century erosion along this portion of
the south bank of Buffalo Bayou. The main objectives of the
initial TARL survey effort were (1) to describe the geomorphology of this portion of the project area as it related to
potential archeological deposits, (2) to determine if buried
prehistoric sites existed along the upper edge or lip of the
valley margin, and (3) to determine whether any culturebearing Buffalo Bayou alluvium sediments remained above
water along the valley margin. After the historic foundations and artifacts of 41HR576 were rediscovered on the
upland, an additional goal became documenting them and
determining their probable use and temporal period. However, it was not until after the fieldwork was completed that
the majority of the archival information about 41HR576 was
compiled and assessed. Following discovery of the upslope
extension of prehistoric site 41HR121, the goals of the survey shifted to determining the size, integrity, and material
remains of this site in order to evaluate its significance and
research potential. Assessing 41HR121 involved subsurface testing and examining its relationship to 41HR576 which
partially overlapped it. These and other additional objectives of the subsequent advanced testing phase are discussed in a later section.
Methods used during the initial survey of the
southestem bank and upland margin of Buffalo Bayou were
identical to those described in Chapter 6.
Survey of the Lower Valley Margin and Beach
The 1997 TARL survey began with a 100 percent pedes'trian survey of the modem sandy beach, examination of the
modem bankline profile, and shovel and auger probing along
the valley margin and beach in order to determine if any
intact archeological deposits remained above water. The first
eight probes (SPl to SP8) and what became Shovel Test 1

39. Overview of beach and valley wall taken from a Paktank, Inc. ship dock that extends out into Buffalo Bayou. The elevated
upland area on the right, ringed by a concrete riprap skirt at its base, is entirely on redeposited clays dredged from a large dock area. This
sediment has buried the original surface and now supports several large chemical holding tanks. The clear grassy area behind this is the
southern end of CWA property and the location of the deeply buried 108-inch water line. The wooded upland and shoreline are mainly on
CWA property, including the site 41HR121/576 area. Note too the slightly recessed shoreline at the base of the large transmission tower
owned by Houston Light and Power in the center of the photograph. This is the area of advanced erosion, probably caused in part the San
Jacinto State Park seawall or bulkhead, which can be seen along the water's edge at the far left. The superstructure of the Battleship Texas
is just outside of this frame on the left.

(STl) were placed along the current bankline, beginning at
the upstream end of the steep erosional bluff and ending
below the grassy open area (Figure 40). These were considered the most likely location for finding emergent, remnant
Buffalo Bayou alluvium sediments. This effort was slowed
considerably by a band of heavy vegetation (over lOm wide
in places) and abundant modern trash and debris along the
shoreline. Earlier unsuccessful efforts to relocate 41HR33
by McGuff and Moore (TARL site files; Heartfield, Price and
Greene, Inc. 1986; see Chapter 5) were also reportedly hindered by this heavy vegetation. Both investigators concluded that the sites were probably eroded or subsided but
that their survival could not be ruled out. TARL personnel
expended considerable time and effort to clear paths and
work areas within this vegetation in order to definitively
address this issue.
In addition to shovel probes, a series of auger probes

were dug farther out on the beach, singly or in a series of up
to four probes (Figure 41). They are designated Sl through
S 13 (for "supplemental probes") and their locations are
shown on Figure 40. The test locations shown on Figure 40
appear to be on the upland, but taking into consideration
the wooded slope and erosion that has taken place since
1986 when the photograph was taken, they are in fact correctly placed. A transect of shovel and auger probes was
also established beginning on the open grassy area and
designated Transect A, running from Al near the upland
margin to A7 on the beach (Figure 42). The transect incorporated existing Shovel Probe 8, which was deepened and designated Probe A4 (see Figure 40).
The results of these subsurface tests are summarized in
Appendix L. The absolute elevations are tied to the arbitrary
NlOO/ElOO (elevation 100.00m) datum established for testing

margin of the southeast (right) bank of Buffalo Bayou, dug during survey testing in the summer 1997. Note the four shovel probes dug on
Paktank, Inc. property. Auger Transect A lies in an open, grassy area. A clearing for a small power or telephone line parallels the valley
margin just east of the line defined by Shovel Probes 9 through 13. Although it appears that several of the beach probes (i.e., Shovel Probes
1-8 and Shovel Test 1) lie on the valley slope or upland, this is due to the additional erosion that has occurred since 1986 when this aerial
photograph was taken. This figure accurately reports their locations as recorded using a combination of GPS and transit data.

cultural inclusions, and explanatory notes are indicated where
necessary, are provided. Obviously modem trash and recently
buried materials were noted but not collected. Prehistoric materials were only found on the surface immediately below the

bankline at and around Shovel Test 1. Other than this, no
artifacts or intact archeological sediments were located above
the water line. In fact, nearly all of these locations are inundated by tides only slightly higher than average and most are

Chapter 7: Past and Present Investigations of the Southeast (Right) Bank of Buffalo Bayou

Farther downslope (particularly below A4 [SP8] and the
wooded cutbank; see Figure 42), thick and variable deposits
of redeposited mottled clays and sands were encountered.
No evidence for any intact sediments was found below the
bankline, except as mentioned previously, very deep and
well below the water line.
Four probes on the upland and slope in the northeastern comer of Paktank property (PAK-1 through PAK-4; see
Figure 40) confirmed that it is composed of dredged
allocthonous sediment. Some intact surface(s) and deposits
undoubtedly underlie this comer and the adjacent holding
tank areas. They are clearly inaccessible but well insulated
from further disturbance.
In addition to the testing along the beach and Transect
A, five additional shovel probes were excavated along the
upland margin (SP9 through SP13). They were placed approximately 25 m apart, beginning within the treeline near
the trash-filled gully and continuing to near the Houston
Light & Power right-of-way (see Figure 40). None yielded
evidence of prehistoric cultural material, although SP9 was
later found to lie very near 41HR121 and SPlO only somewhat farther away. All yielded buried historic artifacts consistent with mid-twentieth-century dumping by the San
Jacinto Inn. Much of this material was noted and discarded.
With the exception of SP9 and SPlO, these probes are considered to belong to 41HR576. While SP9 and SPlO are nominally associated with 41HR121, the content of the artifacts
and their locations on either side of the trash-filled gully
clearly indicates they are more closely related to the overlying historic site 41HR576. Historic artifacts were found scattered on the surface all along the upland margin.
Reconnaissance of the valley margin and adjacent upland also revealed the presence of a large number of aboveground concrete and shellcrete features, including the circular concrete structure (possibly a water tank) already mentioned (see Figures 31 and 40). Others appear to be footings
or foundations for large machinery while several more could
be foundations for small buildings or other structures. At
least one near the Houston Light & Power powerline rightof-way has been undercut and fallen to the beach below,
and another (adjacent to SP13) is now threatened. A particularly dense cluster of these above-ground remains were
found near the northeastern end of the CWA property. Visibility and access to these remains are hampered by the density of trees now growing on the property. Aerial photographs from 1930 and 1956 clearly show this as a relatively
open prairie grassland. The cluster of features can also be
seen on these photographs, along with a shell road leading
to them (Figure 43). What these artifacts and features may
represent is considered next, along with other possible uses
and/or occupations of this relatively undisturbed upland
area.

111

Site 41HR576
Neyland first recorded the concrete footings and circular structure in the late 1950s. During the archeological survey for the 108-inch CWA water line, Moore (Heartfield,
Price and Greene, Inc. 1986; TARL site files) recorded these
historic remains as site 41HR576 (see Chapter 5). These remains are west of the boundary between the George Ross
headright and the McCormick League which ran roughly
along what is now Highway 134 (Cartier and Hole 1972;
Wagner 1986). Based on the artifacts found on the surface
Moore concluded that site 41HR576 had at least two components, (1) a nineteenth-century one related to San Jacinto
celebrations and picnicking and (2) the later dumping of
hotelware, glass, eating utensils, and the like by the nearby
San Jacinto Inn, which operated from 1927 to 1967 (Butcher
n.d., cited in Hoyt et al. 1998:77). The vast majority of the
historic artifacts on the surface across the length of the
valley margin is consistent with the dumping hypothesis.
Innumerable broken pieces of white ironstone, made by the
Shenango China Co. and stamped by a Houston restaurant
supply company, along with cocktail forks, Tabasco sauce
bottles, and broken glassware are consistent with this interpretation (see Appendix F). The density of the San Jacinto
Inn material appears to increase substantially in and around
the narrow gully just northeast of, and partly overlapping,
41HR121 (see Figure 40). Other historic materials include
metal cans and fragments, whole and crushed oyster shells,
brick, broken glass and bottle fragments, and the remains of
crab claws and domestic chickens. No conclusive evidence
of nineteenth-century use was noted during the brief TARL
fieldwork on and around 41HR576 (excluding the gully). Subsequent archival research, while still preliminary, indicates
that 41HR576 is likely composed of multiple historic components, several of which pertain to significant events in Texas
history.
The original route of the Lynchburg-Harrisburg road
ran through the CWA property and was moved eastward at
least twice before becoming established along what is now
Highway 134 or Battleground Road by the tum of the century (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986: 18; Wagner 1986;
Figures 26 and 36). Traces of an earlier roadway can be discerned on aerial photographs as late as the 1930s (see Figure 43) and follows generally the high ground along Buffalo
Bayou before skirting lower, marshy areas within the park
and continuing northward (see Figure 36). In fact, it appears
that an older road trace runs diagonally from Tuckers Bayou
(west of Battleground Road) toward to the park shoreline
and almost directly to the concrete foundations and remains
seen on Figure 43. Temporary camping by travelers along
the Lynchburg-Harrisburg road was probably commonplace,
particularly by those waiting to cross the ferries. It is re-

to be the former Lynchburg-Harrisburg and New Washington roads. The former passes directly by what appear to be foundations and ruins
of a recently abandoned historic occupation on land later reported to be owned by Mellie K. Esperson. The latter roadway passes by the
southernmost tip of Santa Anna Bayou. The intersection of these two roadways is believed to be the center of the camp occupied by the
Texan Army prior to the Battle of San Jacinto in 1836. (Photograph reproduced by permission of Tobin International, Ltd. 1998).

ported that thousands of people fleeing the advancing Mexican forces were backed up waiting to cross Lynch's Ferry
during the Runaway Scrape in March and April 1936. Mrs.
Dilue Harris reported that it took three days to cross (Harris
1901). Another traveler, William Fairfax Gray described the
situation thus: "the prairie near Lynch's resembled a camp
meeting: it was covered with carts, wagons, horses, mules,
tents, men, women, and children and all the baggage of a
flying multitude" (Gray 1965:151).
Moore (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986, following Tolbert 1959) originally suggested that the Texan camp
prior to and shortly after the Battle of San Jacinto may have
included all orpartoftheCWA Valve Station No. 1 property.
Moore pointed out that all of the known artifacts that could
be confidently attributed to the battle were reportedly found
outside of the current park boundary and east of Battleground Road (e.g., Cartier and Hole 1972; Duke 1974a, 1974b;
Ing 1974). These include a Mexican cannonball, broken sabre blade, a gunflint, musket parts, and a Mexican eagle hat
medallion. In light of this possibility, the author has undertaken a recent review of evidence related to the battle, including ( 1) firsthand accounts, reports, and correspondence
(official and unofficial) by both Mexican and Texan officers
and troops; (2) secondhand accounts of the battle that include detailed information on the battle (some of which was
obtained from survivors), (3) previous historical treatments
of the battle itself, and finally (4) maps and reconstructions
of the battleground and environs and the positions of camps
and events.
Anyone even remotely familiar with the contending
versions of the events and actions before, during, and after
the battle is aware that nearly the only point of agreement is
that the Texans won. Other than that, personal allegiances,
antagonisms, and self-promotion colored most of the versions of what actually occurred. Many other factors also
complicate the study of the Battle of San Jacinto, including
when the accounts were written, by whom and why, their
potential perspective or overall view and understanding of
the battle, among others. A detailed exploration and distillation of the available information and even a summary report
of conclusions is beyond the means and needs of the present
report. Nevertheless, a few relevant observations are presented in order to illustrate the virtual certainty that events
surrounding the battle were not confined, or perhaps even
centered in, the current state park but included adjacent
areas such as the CWA property. Below is a partial list of the
sources identified and consulted during the course of this
preliminary research. It is divided into firsthand accounts,
secondhand accounts, reconstructions, battlefield maps (including the artist and date drafted, if available), and also
references to the identification and emplacement of historical markers within the park beginning in the 1890s. This list
is by no means intended as a comprehensive bibliography
but rather a resource and starting point for future research.

Placement of Historical Markers within the State Park:

Hill 1936
Hoytetal.1998
Southwestern Historical Association Quarterly 1901

Review of several accounts of the disposition of the
Mexican and Texan armies and their camps, combined with
careful scrutiny of early topographic maps, strongly suggests that the current location of historic markers within the
San Jacinto Battlefield State Park have been misplaced. These
locations do not make sense given the descriptions of the
firsthand accounts of the battle surveyed thus far. The placement of these commemorative markers was done at least
once by a small group of veterans of the battle nearly 50
years later, in 1894. Reportedly, none of the men agreed on
the exact locations and one claimed he did not recognize
anything (Hoyt et al. 1998:75). Several other field visits were
made over the next several years and pipes marking the locations decided upon were emplaced in 1897 or 1901 (Hill 1936;
Muir 1996; Texas Historical Association Quarterly 19021903:258-261). They were then replaced by granite markers
in 1912 by the Daughters of the Republic of Texas. The uncertainty and disagreement among the veterans is perhaps
not surprising given the extensive deforestation that must
have accompanied the peak of local timber milling between
1870 and 1910 in the vicinity of the San Jacinto River and
Buffalo Bayou (Kibler et al. 1996:69). A denuded landscape,
even prior to subsidence and the deposition of dredged
sediment, might affect even the most vivid and accurate
memories of events that took place more than half a century
before. Shoreline erosion may have also been a factor. One
veteran, James M. Hill stated in 1894 that, in relation to the
where General Houston lay when Santa Anna was first
brought to him after the battle, it was then much nearer the
water's edge because "the bayou has been gradually cutting in toward the south" (Hill 1936: 17).
Nearly all accounts of the battle recount how the Tex~
ans, upon reaching Lynch's Ferry and discovering that Santa
Anna's forces were at New Washington, fell back into the
treeline along the banks of Buffalo Bayou. There they intercepted the Mexican forces on the afternoon of April 20, 1836
and traded small arms and cannon fire, the Texans being well
protected by the natural "breastworks" of the upland margin and treeline. After a brief cavalry skirmish, the Mexican

forces fell back and established camp on a ridge of higher
ground to the east, near what later became known as Santa
Anna Bayou (see Figure 36). The armies faced each other
across a broad expanse of prairie at a distance estimated to
be between several hundred yards and a mile or more. The
next morning, the Mexicans were reinforced by perhaps 500
men. At or around 3 o'clock that afternoon, the Texans "paraded" and assembled in attack formation in a treeless hollow out of sight of the Mexican troops, deployed from there,
and marched directly across the open prairie toward the
Mexican camp and breastworks. The fact that the Texans
had to march slightly uphill to reach the Mexican line is
evidenced by several reports that the Mexicans shot over
their heads as they advanced. The bold Texan attack caught
the Mexicans by surprise and, after managing only brief,
disorganized resistence, the Mexicans were routed and dispersed. The battle itself was reportedly over in as little as 15
to 18 minutes but the slaughter continued for many hours.
Hundreds of Mexican troops were killed, wounded, and captured. Santa Anna was apprehended the next day and was
returned a prisoner to the Texan camp, sealing the victory.
With Santa Anna in captivity, the remainder of Mexican forces
withdrew from Texas.
There are several aspects of these accounts that merit
consideration. The first is that the armies reportedly faced
each other across an open prairie. Figure 36, which is the
earliest detailed topographic map of the area (unfortunately
surveyed over 80 years after the battle) clearly shows a fairly
deep, unnamed bayou running directly in front of the reputed Texan positions on the shores of Buffalo Bayou within
the park. Only a few accounts even mention this landform
and of these only one (a secondhand account by Sam
Houston's son, Col. Andrew Jackson Houston, 1925) specifies that the Texans had to go through such a barrier. Other
accounts suggest that this slough, which was almost certainly wooded, was instead the barrier behind which the
Texans formed their battle lines, concealed from the Mexicans on the narrow projection of higher ground extending
into the state park (see Figure 36). Furthermore, several accounts describe what is essentially a countermarch of the
assembled Texans out onto the prairie before turning and
commencing the frontal attack on the Mexican line. Again,
the hollow behind the small bayou fits well with this scenario. The Texans numbered nearly 800 men, far too many to
occupy the brief segment of higher land and bankline within
the park. Several reports have them strung out at least several hundred yards, which makes sense given their numbers
and the defensive posture of their encampment. Several small
details (such as a prank reputedly pulled on members of a
scouting party by Erasmus "Deaf' Smith) similarly suggest
that Texans were arrayed much nearer Tuckers Bayou than
is generally believed. In fact, a very likely place for the center of the Texas line, where the Twin Sister's cannons were
deployed, seems to be the head of the gently sloping gully
that points southeastward on a line generally from the label

Chapter 7: Past and Present Investigations of the Southeast (Right) Bank of Buffalo Bayou

"channel" in Buffalo Bayou to the southernmost tip of Santa
Anna Bayou, due east of the 34 benchmark, on Figure 36. If
so, this puts the Texans well within what is now Paktank
property. Finally, all of the battlefield maps available lack
topographic detail and accuracy. Many grossly distort the
actual scale and relationship of landforms; shrinking the
marsh, omitting the bayou(s), and disregarding local topography. They frequently are impressionistic and hinder, rather
than aid, an understanding of the battle.
Finally, the 1930 aerial photograph (see Figure 43)
shows faint traces of what are believed to be the original
(ornearly original) routes of the Harrisburg-Lynchburg and
New Washington roads, passing through the CWA property (cf. Heartfield, Price and Greene 1986: 17-18). The very
straight line running from southeast to northwest is likely
the New Washington/Morgans Point. Farther to the southeast, this road intersects just the tip of Santa Anna Bayou.
This would have been the route taken by the Mexican forces
on April 20, 1836 and along which hundreds were apparently killed the next day. The New Washington road continues toward Buffalo Bayou and crosses what is now Highway 134 (the bright, well defined line running due northsouth) before intersecting a second faint former road south
of the cluster of foundations. Several accounts of the Battle
of San Jacinto place the center of the Texan line at or just
west of the intersection of these roads. If these are in fact
those routes (or nearly those routes), which seems reasonable based on what is known of the historical topography
and descriptions, then the Texan camp falls well south of
the areas identified within the state park. Instead, it would
then appear that the Texans would have been strung out
along the wooded valley margin immediately above the
wedge of Buffalo Bayou alluvium sediments visible on Figure 43. In fact, not only would their camp area encompass
the CWA property but also much of the adjacent Paktank
property as well (cf. Figures 26 and 37). Such a placement
would also remove the Texans somewhat from the main
portion of the unnamed bayou immediately in their front (if
they were only within the current park area) and place them
at the edge of a wide, grassy plain as described in nearly all
of the accounts. While the younger Houston may indeed
be correct in stating that the Texans crossed that bayou in
the early stages of their attack, the descriptions of
Houston's "interception" of Santa Anna's troops at the
junction of these roads and of the camps facing each other
directly across a wide prairie is more consistent with the
Texan camp being south of the state park. Again, this is
consistent with the apparent location of known battle-related artifacts being found south of the park.
Beginning almost immediately after the battle, the battleground area became a popular tourist attraction and picnicking spot. San Jacinto Day celebrations became an annual
event (Kibler et al. 1996:113; Hoyt et al. 1998:75). Souvenir
hunting and surface collecting became a popular pastime
during these outings with the result that most archeological

115

remains of these events, if they survive, are likely to be small
and inconspicuous. The Texan troops salvaged a great deal
of material after the battle (including hundreds of muskets,
sabres, and pistols) which also reduces the likelihood of
significant surviving artifacts. Furthermore, the main action
of the battle surely took place well east of the CWA property
and Battleground road, particularly west of and around Santa
Anna Bayou and the marshes northwest of Peggy Lake (see
Figure 26). Studies such as those conducted at Little Big
Horn (Scott 1996; Scott et al. 1989) which combine sensitive
magnetometer surveys, detailed provenience information,
and forensic analysis to reconstruct battle events and even
the movement of individuals (or at least specific firearms)
around a battlefield may be fruitful despite the intensive
collecting. The evidence upon which such studies are based
is typically small and fragmentary, and likely to be overlooked by collectors without metal detectors. However, the
CWA property was probably only occupied for a period of
several days by the Texan Army (and earlier by fleeing refugees waiting to cross at Lynch's) and was the scene of only
minor skirmishing on April 20. Nevertheless, it is possible
that some evidence of the Texan camp may be found if similar efforts are undertaken.
Other than its likely use for day picnicking and casual
tourism, little is known of subsequent land use of the CWA
property. Moore reports that court documents reveal that
the CWA property functioned as "quasi-public" facility
known as the "Campground," perhaps echoing its earlier
usage by the Texan army (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc.
1986: 17). Deed and legal information pertaining to nineteenthand early-twentieth-century use of this and neighboring
properties has been partially compiled but has not been synthesized and interpreted (cf. Cartier and Hole 1972; Wagner
1986).
Two property boundary maps drawn by the Port of
Houston (the first in 1933 and the second in 1949) show the
area of the clustered concrete foundations as the property
of Mrs. Mellie K. Esperson. She and her husband, Niels,
strongly supported development of the Houston Ship Channel. Following the death of her husband in the 1920s, Mrs.
Esperson became a very successful businessperson and
her holdings included several properties on the Houston
Ship Channel (Cottrell 1996). Among their business interests were a roller bit company, a clay company, and at least
twornills(Bailey 1931:13;Nahas 1980:40-41). Neyland'sphotographs show what appears to be a concrete foundation
along the bankline near 41HR104 that also may be related to
the ruins on the adjacent upland. The foundations could on
the other hand represent a homestead or business related to
the nearby San Jacinto townsite. A 1916 USGS survey (see
Figure 26) recorded a single rectangular structure in what
appears to the the same location. Regardless, by 1930, the
site appears to have been abandoned. The area defined by
the structures and foundations visible on Figure 43 conform
closely to the ca. 20-acre plot identified as Esperson's prop-

116

erty on the Port Authority maps. It is clearly possible that
the remains are those of an early-twentieth-century manufacturing or industrial site, a potentially significant category
ofresource (Kibler et al. 1996:91-92).
Other known or suspected uses of the general area include cattle ranching and homesteading. The eastern portion of the CWA Valve Station No. 1 property lies within the
speculative San Jacinto City townsite. Faint outlines of rectangular lots or blocks can be seen on Figure 43. A local
resident, D. Besau, reported in 1972 that early this century
the Houston Light & Power right-of-way was occupied by
"nesters" who were driven out by hurricane-related flooding in either 1900or1915 (Cartier and Hole 1972: 168-169).
Beginning around 1940, Besau began cultivating and plowing a small (ca. 1 acre) plot on this right-of-way. This plowing uncovered the Mexican cannon ball and sabre fragment
mentioned previously.
In conclusion, little detailed information is currently
available about the history of the CWA property or the material remains of 41HR576, apart from the ubiquitous hotel
and restaurant debris from the nearby San Jacinto Inn and
the evidence of nineteenth-century picnicking. It is likely,
however, that several potential occupations may be have
taken place on this property, including some of particular
significance to Texas history. Recommendations regarding
further investigation of 41HR576 are outlined in Chapter 8.

Site 41HR121
Survey and Initial Testing
During the course of the extensive surveying and probing along the modem bankline, a single prehistoric sherd
was discovered on the ground surface in an area of very
dense vegetation and trash just below the cutbank. Shovel
Test 1 was placed at this location(Figure 44). Subsurface
testing, however, revealed that no intact Late Holocene deposits remained below the bankline there. No additional prehistoric artifacts were recovered in Shovel Test 1. However,
in a small patch of recent colluvium (later recognized as the
same black silty clay mantling the valley slope) five additional untempered sandy-paste (Goose Creek untyped) body
sherds were recovered (see Appendix L). A few Rangia shells
were also observed on the surface. Approximately 20 m upstream, another Goose Creek untyped sherd was recovered
from deep in Shovel Probe 7. This probe was also below the
existing cutbank. Subsurface stratigraphy again indicated
significant slumping of Beaumont Formation and Holocene
sediments which accounted for the depth of the artifact. No
intact Holocene sediments were found above the water line
anywhere below the bankline. It was clear that the artifacts
and shell were probably eroded from farther upslope.
A line of five additional shovel probes was excavated
along a transect more or less straight up the heavily vegetated valley slope to determine the source of the displaced
artifacts. These probes were assigned letter designations A
!hrough E and extended from just above the bankline up to

the upland margin, just off the access road and small
powerline clearing. After the decision was later made to expand testing along the valley slope, this original upslope
transect became the "O" (or "0-NE") line (see Figure 44).
When several of these shovel probes yielded buried,
apparently undisturbed prehistoric remains the locality was
designated an upslope extension of site 41HR12 l, defined in
1959 by Neyland. Close examination of the bankline between
Shovel Test 1 and Shovel Probe 7 suggested that the site
once extended farther downslope but had been truncated
by erosion. Furthermore, it was consistent with both
Neyland's description of 41HR121 as extending "several
hundred yards" upstream from 41HR33 (see Appendix N)
and with the photograph of the circular concrete structure
nearby (see Figures 31 and 40) that he indicated was "above"
41HR121. It could be argued that the site discovered by
TARL is actually 41HR122 (HSC #8), but Neyland's notes on
it are somewhat ambiguous, stating only that 41HR122 is
between one gully (probably the San Jacinto Inn trash-filled
gully) and a second, larger one (perhaps the low, partially
filled area near the 108-inch water line). Photographs of
41HR122 do bear a strong resemblance to the current site,
but this may simply reflect pre-development, natural conditions along this portion of the Buffalo Bayou valley. Nevertheless, the site area discovered by TARL is undoubtedly
related to the complex of sites Neyland recorded along the
southeastern (right) bank of Buffalo Bayou. Therefore, the
designation 41HR121 has been retained.
Once discovered, the objective of TARL testing at
41HR121 shifted to determining the limits and depth of the
site, as well as some indications of its subsurface stratigraphy. Therefore, the probes designated A through E became
the anchors of a grid system (the zero-line) and transects
projected out from these probes, following generally the
strike of the modern valley wall, or roughly 52Â° East of magnetic North (see Figure 44). Individual probes were placed at
5-m increments and identified by their distance northeast or
southwest from the original five probes. In this way the
probe 10 m northeast of probe Con the 0-line was abbreviated C-NE-10. Very dense, heavy understory vegetation severely limited visibility on the slope, and transects had to be
cleared using machetes and the brush pushed aside or hauled
off-site. The grid was laid out and maintained using only a
30-m tape and a hand-held compass. Despite these problems, the transects (shot in later using a transit and TDS) do
roughly follow the trend of the valley wall. Sediment from
nearly all of the probes was screened through at least 1/4inch (6 mm) wire mesh. Two consecutive negative probes
(i.e., for prehistoric material) terminated further extension of
that line except along Transect B, which extended a total of
70 m along this segment of the valley wall, from just southwest of the circular concrete feature to nearly to the open
grassy slope.
Three other probes were later dug in the spring of 1998,
after most of the vegetation was cleared away during the
later advanced testing phase of investigations. They were

arbitrarily assigned to Transects F and G (see Appendix L,
Figure 44 ). The F transect actually lies between the A and B
transects while the single probe on the G transect (G-1) lay
across the small powerline clearing, farther east, farther back
on the upland in a low area that was inundated with water for
much of the spring. Unlike the original survey probes, the
sediment from these later tests was either water screened (1/
8-inch mesh) or floated (1/16-inch mesh).
Once the general site boundaries were determined, two
l-x-1-m test units were excavated in 10-cm maximum arbitrary levels with all sediment water screened through 1/8inch (3 mm) mesh (described below). In addition, a small test
trench (A-SW-9) was dug near the cutbank. Data on elevations, sediments, and inclusions encountered during the
excavation of these probes and units is provided in Appendix L. Recovery from Test Units 1 and 2 is given on Table 9 in
AppendixB.

Results of Initial Testing
As mentioned, additional prehistoric cultural material
was recovered upslope from Shovel Test 1. Shovel Probe ANE-0 yielded a small amount of Rangia shell and a single
flake. A much larger amount of shell, bone fragments, and
two additional flakes were recovered farther upslope in probe
B-NE-0. The shell was covered by a thin lens of historic
material including glass and metal. The Rangia lens was
about 5 cm thick here, lying directly on a mottled clay believed to be Beaumont Formation.
Continuing upslope, another flake, bone, and lesser
amounts of shell were recovered in probe C-NE-0. Tirree
sandy-paste (Goose Creek untyped) sherds, but no shell,
was recovered in probe D-0-NE. Probe E-0-NE, just northwest of the powerline clearing was sterile for prehistoric
artifacts. Again, once it was confirmed that a buried intact
archeological site did exist on the valley slope, an additional
33 probes (not including the F and G probes) were dug in
transects outward from this baseline to define the limits of
the site.
Eventually a total of 18 Goose Creek untyped sherds (in
addition to the 7 found below the bankline), seven flakes,
and faunal remains (including animal bone and 1,200 g of
Rangia shell) was recovered during the initial probing of
this site in the summer of 1997 (excluding the F and G
transects which were dug later). Based on the probe data
only, it was difficult to precisely estimate the thickness of
the Rangia shell deposit(s), but it was clearly very thin, in
most places no more than one or two shells thick. As much
of the Rangia shell was collected as was practical given the
high degree of fragmentation, some of which was clearly
attributable to the use of shovels and dry screening the
hard, tenacious clay-rich sediment. A central area of what
appeared to be continuous Rangia shell was defined, partially surrounded by deposits containing more artifacts and
less bone but no shell was recovered.

Many probes contained abundant historic material as
well, including broken glass, bottles and fragments,
whiteware ceramics, concrete, coal, metal (including aluminum, a steel-wool pad, cocktail forks, and abundant small
bits of heavily rusted metal), and oyster shell as well as
bones and crab claw fragments. Due to the abundance of
very small glass and metal fragments in some probes, only
larger specimens or representative samples were collected.
The artifacts were consistent with Moore's descriptions of
mid-twentieth century dumping at 41HR576 by the nearby
San Jacinto Inn (Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986), and
in some cases, such as the labeled hotelware, matched exactly. The greatest density of historic material appeared to
be in and around a Small gully north of the prehistoric site,
but it clearly overlapped 41HR121 to some extent. However,
while it appeared that these 41HR576-related materials were
stratigraphically above and separated from the buried prehistoric materials, this could not be determined conclusively.
Therefore, two l-x-1-m test units were laid out and excavated. An additional goal was to determine if any evidence
for downslope displacement could be seen. Both were placed
within the limits of the shell deposit (see Figure 44).
The first (Test Unit 1) lay just off the NE-0 baseline
between probes B-NE-0 and C-NE-0, and the other (Test
Unit 2) was placed next to probe A-SW-10 near the bankline
(see Figure 44). A small test trench (A-SW-9) was dug from
the corner of this test unit to the bankline to determine the
relationship of the buried shell lens to the bank and underlying sediment. A thin lens of shell and artifacts was found
eroding out of the bankline in a small area near Test Unit No.
2 and Test Trench A-SW-9, but this profile was obscured by
heavy vegetation. There was no evidence for shell displacement above the bankline although it was quite shallowly
buried (ca. 10 cm or less). Stratigraphic and sedimentological notes on excavation levels in both of these units are
presented in Appendix L, along with a stratigraphically arrayed representation of the cultural and faunal material recovered from them.
Test Unit 1 was located on what appeared to be a relatively flat or level surface on the otherwise sloping valley
wall (see Figure 44). Prehistoric artifacts and a few Rangia
shells, apparently mixed with historic material, were encountered in Level 2 along the northeastern half of the excavation
unit. The partially exposed, shallowly buried shell lens was
pedestaled, and Levels 3 and 4 removed the remaining black
silty clay in the center and downslope half ("west") of the
unit. The next two levels (5 and 6) removed the thin (5 cm or
less) prehistoric shell lens in two phases. The photograph in
Figure 45 shows the sparseness of the shell lens at the base
of Level 5. Level 7 was excavated only in one 50-x-50-cm
quadrant to remove the remaining traces of shell and confirm that the underlying Beaumont Formation clays had been
reached. These findings at first suggested that the historic
and prehistoric material may have been mixed, but later investigations made it clear that this mixing was more appar-

120

Lake described by Paine 1990). This clay was in tum underlain by a transitional zone grading into intact Beaumont
sandy clays containing variable quantities of calcium carbonate and ferruginous nodules.
Historic material was generally restricted to the upper
10 to 15 cm, although occasional small metal and glass fragments were displaced downward. The greatest concentrations occurred northeast of the 5 m SW gridline, nearer the
gully. The historic artifacts recovered to that point appeared
to be exclusively early- to mid-twentieth-century restaurant
debris dumped by the San Jacinto Inn.
Beneath the historic material and separated from it in
some areas by up to 10 cm of culturally sterile deposits was
believed to be a ca. 300-350 m2 area of intact prehistoric
material, in or very near the base of the very dark gray silty
clay. Approximately 170 m 2 of that area was inferred to be a
thin, roughly oval-shaped continuous Rangia shell deposit
with some bone and artifacts. The shell lenses appeared to
lie within the area delimited by C transect and bankline and
the NE 0 and SW lOtransects (see Figure 44) on the sloping
valley wall. This deposit was thought to be partially surrounded on the east (i.e., upslope), south, and southwest by
artifact-bearing sediments that lack shell. The width of the
nonshell area was inferred to be no more than ca. 10 m, and
the site did not appear to continue farther back on the level
upland, given the negative results for cultural material in
Shovel Probes E-NE-0 and E-SW-5. The shells, while friable,
were mostly whole and well grouped both horizontally and
vertically. Their depth from the surface varied. Cultural materials recovered include ceramics, lithics, and bone. No temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from prehistoric
contexts: all of the ceramics were undecorated, untempered
sandy-paste body sherds (ie., Goose Creek untyped) which
occur throughout virtually the entire Ceramic period.
The highest densities of prehistoric material were associated with and immediately above the buried shell layer,
suggesting that the historic and prehistoric cultural materials were well separated. The historic material related to
41HR576 only partially overlapped with the more deeply
buried prehistoric site (41HR121). The components were
vertically rather than horizontally separated.
The sparse cultural material and discreteness of the prehistoric shell lens(es) suggested the potential opportunity
to investigate a small intact site with a limited number of
occupations and therefore potentially significant intrasite
spatial patterning (see discussion in Chapter 5). Density of
shell and artifacts at 41HR121 appeared to be quite low. It
was thought to resemble the nearby Redtail site (41HR58 l;
Gadus and Howard 1990), but the shell lens(es) at 41HR121
appeared to be even thinner. Other possible analogues to
the 41HR121 deposits were the small low-density sites excavated in the Trinity River Delta (Aten 1983b) as well as a

slope above it, in the Clear Lake area (Weinstein 1991 ). In-

vestigations at the former sites led Aten ( 1983b) to hypothesize that a minimal unit of settlement-the "hearth-midden
couplet"-was the fundamental building block of shell
middens in. the Upper Texas Coast. If so, sites such as
41HR121, which clearly represented only a limited number of
such occupations, were believed to be potentially significant (cf. Kibler et al. 1996:53-54).
All of the shovel probes were excavated to what was
believed to be intact Beaumont Formation sediments. However, later testing suggested that in some areas of the site,
particularly along the southern edge (as defined on Figure
44), the excavators may have instead only reached a mottled
transition zone rather than the base of the Holocene deposits. In other words, the shell lens may actually continue and
curve eastward and down, following the original south facing valley wall of Tucker's Bayou. If so, those cultural deposits are more deeply buried, and while they may have
been disturbed to some degree by the emplacement of the
nearby 108-inch water line, they are now more deeply and
safely sealed from future adverse impacts related to planned
navigational improvements of the Houston Ship Channel.
The portion of 41HR121 defined by TARL testing, on the
other hand, is nearer the surface along the present valley
slope and is more immediately susceptible to adverse impact.
Given the available information in the summer of 1997,
41HR121 appeared to satisfy Section 106 criteria fornomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The site was
within an area of potential adverse impact and appeared to
have significant research potential. However, a few questions remained including the age of the cultural deposit(s),
the possibility of downslope movement, the separation of
historic and prehistoric strata, and the precise depth of the
shell and its proximity to the Beaumont Formation, among
others. In anticipation of a recommendation of National Register of Historic Places eligibility and mitigation of adverse
impact, TARL proposed that the existing survey contract be
modified to allow for additional testing of 41HR121 in order
to resolve these lingering questions and to evaluate the
potential and efficacy of specific field methods and laboratory analyses to assist in planning future investigations.
Advanced Testing
Objectives
There were several objectives for additional testing of
41HR121. They were designed to contribute to our understanding of the site and to develop and evaluate methods
and approaches to realize the full potential of thin, laterally
extensive sites. The first objective was determining more
precisely the depth, lateral extent, and character of the site
deposits. While the primary motivation for this was archeological-i.e., the need to better understand the depositional
context and integrity of the cultural deposits-such data
may also be used to facilitate mechanical removal of over-

burden should additional work be necessary. A related objective was elucidating the site stratigraphy and
paleogeomorphology, especially the relationship of the shell
lens to the Beaumont Formation sediments. Another was to
test the nature of the shell vs. nonshell areas. That in turn is
related to the question of determining whether the deposit( s)
represent a single or at least limited number of occupations.
Increasing the sample of diagnostic artifacts, collecting wellprovenienced radiocarbon samples, and setting out a permanent site grid and emplacing a permanent datum were
also goals of the additional work. A Total Data Station/EDM
system was used to obtain an accurate topographic and
locational map of the site area. Several specialized analyses
were also tested on a relatively small scale to determine their
worth should further work be necessary. Likewise, field techniques, data recordation, and excavation strategies were
modified, tested, and refined in order to devise the best plan
possible for conducting future investigations at this or other
such sites. Finally, it was hoped that an adequate understanding of the historic artifacts in the immediate site area
(the partially overlapping 41HR576/San Jacinto Inn dump
component) could be gained during the testing phase in
order to justify later removal of those deposits if necessary
without sacrificing the archeological and historical information they might contain.

Field and Laboratory Methods and Plan of
Investigations
In order to satisfy the objectives of the advanced testing program, field and laboratory procedures had to be
adapted accordingly. Field and laboratory procedures were
themselves considered a subject of investigation: to work
out the best possible methods in anticipation of additional
excavations at41HR121. Therefore, the procedures employed
are discussed in some detail.
The first objective was to clear the site of brush and
trees smaller than six inches in diameter. As stipulated in the
right-of-entry agreement between TARL and the landowner,
the CWA. Once the site area was cleared, the arbitrary northing/easting site grid established during the earlier survey
testing (datum Nl 00/El 00, elevation 100.00 m) was re-established. This grid was oriented to magnetic north. A Total
Data Station/EDM was used to reshoot previously excavated units and probes, and hundreds of additional topographic and excavation-related position readings were taken.
The results have been compiled and are plotted as contour
line base maps in Figures 44 and 47.
Basic excavation strategy was based on subdivisions
of a 1-x- l-m square. The need to maximize horizontal provenience control at a small, discrete site has already been discussed. The problem with doing so is often that documentation typically requires a prohibitive number of forms and
paperwork in order to maintain adequate control and field
notation. Therefore, a methodology and set of forms were

121

developed to minimize the record-keeping problems while at
the same time retaining adequate provenience control, high
standards of field notation, and flexibility. The forms used
are reproduced in Appendix 0.
Each unit was divided into four 50-x-50-cm "quadrants"
or sixteen 25-x-25-cm "quadrats" (both common referred to
simply as "quads"). Each quad was assigned a letter code
that, when coupled with the unit number (the northing and
easting of the southwestern corner) and the level number,
defined a unique provenience unit which, once the system
was mastered, was easily recognizable and understandable and which could then be used to maintain fine-grained
control of the provenience data. The 25-cm quadrants were
assigned single letters A through P while the 50-cm ones
used double letter code, AA, BB, etc. While provenience
resolution is based on these subdivisions, the basic analytical and documentary unit remained the l-x-1-m square.
For each level in each 1-m square, a "master" level record
form (with a key showing either the 4 or 16 quads) was kept
on which all observations and descriptions were made.
However, two sets of addenda sheets were also available
(with either two [50 cm] or four [25 cm] grid panels), as was
standard graph paper to allow a drawing of the entire unit,
although this was rarely necessary. These addenda sheets
could be easily tied into the master sheet and were used for
such things as recording artifact and bone locations. The
advantage was in reducing routine redundancy in notation
while at the same time increasing provenience resolution
and also permitting sufficient flexibility to deal with complex spatial or sedimentary phenomena. Somewhat surprisingly, the difference between the two quad sizes in terms of
time per level was actually quite close, with the 25-cm quadrat system taking only about 15 percent longer than the 50cm system, primarily due to time spent writing waterproof
(linoleum-backed) tags to accompany the sediment to the
screens and the laboratory. In fact, the excavators remarked
that in some ways the 25-cm grid was easier to work with
since it was easier to maintain vertical control and anxiety
about displacing in situ artifact(s) was greatly reduced
when working with these smaller volumes. Setting a minimal provenience unit and avoiding point plotting is advantageous in situations such as 41HR121 where the matrix is
clay-rich and sediments often too hard or sticky to allow
careful in situ exposure and removal (cf. Aten 1983b). Lack
of horizontal provenience resolution can be problematical
at complex sites, even ones with only a limited number of
components (e.g., the Redtail site, 41HR581, Gadus and
Howard 1990).
All or part of five units were excavated in the spring of
1998 using this excavation strategy. In addition, a long
narrow profile trench was dug, as were three additional
shovel probes (see Figure 47). Because the site could only
be cleared of trees less than six inches in diameter, the
density of the remaining trees precluded the use of a backhoe. So instead a 36-inch Ditch Witch tiller was used (Fig-

ure 48). The effective cutting. depth of this machine is ca.
32 inches, which was more than sufficient to reach intact
Pleistocene deposits at 41HR121. Another advantage is
that it is possible to obtain a continuous profile, although

the walls often need considerable cleaning. The relatively
narrow gauge of the cutting surface is also much smaller
than a backhoe and is less destructive to smaller sites. A
disadvantage is the narrow trench sometimes makes it dif-

the deep, weathered Lake Charles series soils on the upland
surface (Wheeler 1976) and is a very fine to fine sandy clay
loam. It has a moderate, subangular to subround blocky
structure. Few (5-25 percent) thin to moderately thick clay
films are noted, but the significant clay in the matrix makes it
sticky and plastic when wet and very hard when dry. Color is
uniformly very dark gray to black (lOYR 2.5/1to7.5YR 2/0).
A few small (< 0.5 mm) reddish black manganese or ferruginous concretions are sometimes noted. The cultural shell
deposits are found near the base of this sediment.
Several facies of the Pleistocene Beaumont Formation
are recognized at 41HR121. Beaumont Facies 1 (BFl) is
stratigraphically below the black silty clay, but they are rarely
unmixed. Both the upper and lower BFl stratigraphic boundaries are frequently mottled and diffuse due to extensive
earthworm bioturbation and perhaps other mechanisms such
as shrink/swell cycling. It is therefore divided into two
subfacies, BFlA and BFlB. BFlA is a transitional sediment.
It is mixed with the black silty clay and frequently extends up
the profile somewhat, occasionally above the shell lens(es).
However, below the black silty clay, it generally lightens in
color with depth and grades into BFlB sediments. Facies IA
sediments are sandy clays (very fine sand) which are very
sticky, plastic, and hard when dry. Increased clay content is
expressed in the common (25-50 percent) to many (50-90
percent) thick clay films visible under magnification. It has a
moderate to locally massive structure; subangular to occasionally subround. The sediment may also contain small
(0.5-1 mm).ferruginous nodules and small patches of granular calcium carbonate. It is generally a darker, mottled color
which again lightens somewhat with depth: 1OYR4/1.5 (dark
gray to dark grayish brown) to 2.5Y 4/2 (dark grayish brown)
or 2.5Y 5/3 (light olive brown). It is much less permeable than
the overlying black silty clay and groundwater was often
observed running along the upper surface of BFlA sediments in unit profiles.
The BFl B sediment, on the other hand, is typically lighter
and grades into Beaumont Facies 2 (BF2) sediments with
increasing depth. BFlB is a sticky plastic to very plastic
sandy clay (fine to very fine sand). It has a moderate to
strong, subangular blocky structure and is very hard when
wet. Small(< 1 mm) manganese inclusions and calcium carbonate, ranging from granules to small, somewhat friable
nodules (ca. 0.5 to 5 mm), are sometimes seen. Colors generally range from 2.5Y 4.5/2 (grayish brown to dark grayish
brown) to lOYR 5/3.5 (brown to yellowish brown). Occasional reddish mottles (ofBF2) increase with depth.
Locally, as for example on the upland margin and around
Test Unit 1, BFl deposits are sometimes noted to have abundant yellowish calcium carbonate nodules up to 5+ mm in
diameter along with smaller quantities of manganese or ferruginous nodules (most less than 1 mm).
Beaumont Facies 2 and Facies 3 sediments are only
noted from deep augering on the middle to lower slope and
near the bank (e.g., in Test Unit 2). BF2 is a hard, fairly homo-

125

geneous very sticky and plastic clay with few sand grains.
Granular calcium deposits are abundant and locally form
"veins" or "snowy" patches. Fewer manganese nodules are
noted overall although there are areas of much higher density of 1-2-mm diameter nodules. Continuous(> 90 percent)
thick clay films are noted. Colors are strong brown (7.5YR 5/
6) to reddish brown 5YR 4/4. BF2 sediments sometimes exhibit mottling with grayish green BF3 clays. BF3 is only
noted in auger cores from low on the valley slope, although
it probably is simply more deeply buried on the upland. It is
a solid, massive clay with some silt-sized particles. Like BF2,
some patches of grainy CaC0 3 are evident, and some
magnanese nodules occur (most< 1 mm). Color range is 2.5Y
515 (light olive brown) to 2.5Y 6/4 (light yellowish brown).
Two representative profiles serve to demonstrate the
relationship between these strata and the buried cultural
deposits. Figure 51 is the Section 2 drawing from the midupper valley slope (cf. Figure 47). A thin layer of topsoil
overlies fairly uniformly thick black silty clay. A discontinuous, single lens of Rangia shell can be seen running along
the unconformable contact between the black silty clay and
BFlA sediments. The actual boundary between these strata
is more diffuse than is indicated on Figure 51, due to earthworm activity. The "darker" zone of BF IA is an area of greater
mottling, which in turn also extends upward somewhat into
the lower portion of the black silty clay stratum. With depth,
the BFlA lightens and grades into BFlB sediments in the
auger core. Beaumont Facies 1 clearly thickens upslope and
especially nearer the upland margin.
Figure 52 on the other hand is a composite of Sections
4 and 5 (cf. Figure 47). The BFl deposits are much thinner on
the lower slope. Transition from overlying black silty clay
sediments (i.e., BFlA) to deeper BF2 deposits (i.e., BFlB)
occurs over a much shorter vertical distance. Stratigraphy
here is essentially compressed. The surface of the BF2 deposit undulates somewhat, suggesting an earlier erosional
episode. Note too the depth of the BF3 sediments. Figure 53
shows a closeup of the very thin, discontinuous cultural
shell lens as it appears in profile. Although typically underlain by 3 to 5 cm of darker BSC/BFlA mottled sediments, the
shell clearly follows the undulating Beaumont Facies 1 surface. This suggests that cultural occupation(s) took place
following a period of erosion of the valley slope and was
accompanied or quickly followed by the onset of colluvial
deposition on the slope. One possibility is that the Buffalo
Bayou channel formerly ran nearer the southeastern bankline
and, due to periodic freshets or storms, prevented sediment
accumulation on the slope. If the channel then migrated
northwestward, the slope might then shift to a depositional
rather than erosional regime and at the same time, a floodplain terrace could be built outward from the valley margin.
Depending on the rapidity with which such a process might
occur, it may be testable using the ceramic collections from
41HR33 and41HR121. If this scenario were correct, then the
41HR33 ceramics (from farther out on the terrace) should be

case, those sediments are certainly more deeply buried and

younger (or at least certainly no older) than the 41HR121
assemblage on the slope. This hypothesis was in fact tested
against the data, and while the channel-migration scenario
cannot be ruled out, the two occupations do not appear to
be significantly different in age. Consequently, there may be
other relationships between the localities (cf. Lido Harbor
[Weinstein 1991], discussed below). It is clear though that
despite the uncertainties caused by mottling, the thin cultural deposits at 41HR121 are very near the unconformable
contact with an eroded BFl surface.
Toward the end of the fieldwork, it was recognized that
the most parsimonious explanation of this downslope compression and other stratigraphic data may be that the former
slope of the valley wall is offset slightly from the current
one. The modern valley margin is oriented roughly 50Â° east
of north. However, based on the apparent dip and strike of
the shell lens( es), the stratigraphic cross sections along the
Ditch Witch trench, and the evidence from historical maps, it
is possible (if not probable) that the paleoslope of the
41HR121 site area actually dipped downward more to the
southwest-an orientation reflecting the effect of an adjacent gully, perhaps related to the complex Tucker Bayou
prior to infilling (cf. Figure 36). By the time this possibility
was recognized, the period of additional testing was nearly
over, and it could not be tested. Stratigraphic data from shovel
probes at the southwestern end of the B gridline and along
Transect A do not clearly support or rule out this possibility. If correct, this suggests that cultural deposits may extend deeper and farther southward, perhaps arcing around

One of the excavation units (Nl 43/E99) was placed about
halfway down the slope in the center of what is believed to
be the main area of shell accumulation (see Figures 44 and
47). As expected, Rangia shell density was much greater
than in the other units, although the shell lens itself was
quite thin. Interestingly, shell did not cover the entire area of
this, or any other, unit. This suggests that the shell lenses
are rather discontinuous and may represent small, discrete
depositional events, comparable to the shell "patches" at
the Lido Harbor (41GV82) site (Weinstein 1991). In other
words, archeological resolution at 41HR121 appears to be
quite high.
Excavation unit Nl 43/E99 was placed very near Shovel
Probe B-SW-5 and Section 4. The objectives of excavating it
was to determine if any indications of the southern edge of
the prehistoric site were nearby and if any evidence for
downslope movement of the shell lens(es) could be discerned. It was hoped that this unit might tie together the
upslope units (e.g. N140E108 andN139E107) with Test Unit
2 near the bankline. It was excavated in 50-cm quadrants.
Level numbers were assigned in the order of excavation.
Therefore, Levels 6 and 8 represent the same stratum and
elevations while Level 7 is deeper than either of them. In the
text, the former level(s) are referred to as Level 6/8.
Soon after excavation began, Rangia shell was encountered in Quadrant DD. The unit is very near the "nick point"
where much of the overlying black silty clay sediment had
been removed. Before the excavators realized that they had
gone too deep and penetrated prehistoric levels, a number
of artifacts were recovered including 9 sherds and 11 debitage
fragments (Table 10 in Appendix B). Due to this inadvertant
mixing the distributional overlap of these prehistoric materials with modem plastic and metal is more apparent than real.
However, the small amount of Rangia and three flakes recovered in Level 2 in Quadrants AA and BB probably were
displaced from slightly higher up the slope along the eroded
nick point shelf and then shallowly buried by later slopewash
deposition. Subsequent excavation of Levels 3 and 4 revealed that up to 15 cm of black silty clay separated the very
sparse shell in Level 2 in these quadrants from the abundant
shell and prehistoric remains removed as Level 5. A large
quantity of bone was also recovered in Level 5. A single
sand-tempered O'Neal Plain, var. Conway sherd and a small
projectile point were also found in Quadrant DD, Level 5.
Because it was extensively reworked, this point could not be
typed but in overall form resembles a Gary dart point (see
Appendix C). A radiocarbon date on shell from Level 5 in

60, or 81.6 percent) of the ceramic sherds from Level 5 were
recovered in eastern Quadrants BB and DD. The same pattern holds true for the next stratigraphic level (Levels 6 and
7) where 10of11 (ca. 91 percent) of the sherds come from
these quadrants. These results are consistent with findings
from adjacent Units N140/E108 andN143/E99 (see Figure 54)
that various artifact classes are differentially distributed and
presumably in-situ.
Unit Nl 40E108 was the only unit excavated entirely by
25-x-25-cm quadrats. Quadrat M was left as a balk unit until
excavations were completed, when multiple special samples
were collected from this column, including oriented micromorphology samples and bulk sediment from which
subsamples for flotation, soil chemistry/granulometry, pollen, and other analyses were taken (see Special Samples
section below). The results of those analyses are presented
in the appendices to this report. In addition, several quadlevels within the prehistoric shell lens were also collected as
bulk sediment samples arid processed in the laboratory.
An attempt was made to match level numbers in Quadrat M with the numbers used in other quadrats, but this was
not possible below Level 6 (the shell layer). Therefore, the
very small amount of shell recovered below this elevation
has been omitted from Table 13 in Appendix B, which tabulates artifact and shell recovery by provenience. Finally, due
at least in part to the flexibility offered by utilizing the quadrat system, as well as difficulties arising from extensive mottling, individual levels were numbered in the order of their
excavation rather than stratigraphic position. For example,
Levels 5 and 6 were excavated in Quadrats I, J, and N before
the same strata were excavated in the other 12 quadrats in
the unit. Consequently, Levels 5 and 8 and Levels 6 and 9 are
equivalent in terms of stratigraphy and elevation. While this
was easily managed in the field and assured that the levels
eventually "matched up," it can be confusing in the laboratory and during analysis and may be better handled in some
other fashion in the future. Nevertheless, level numbers assigned in the field have been retained and the tabulated
results rearranged to reflect relative stratigraphic position
(see Table 13 in Appendix Band Appendix L).
Vertical artifact distribution results from Unit Nl 40/El 08
are very similar to adjacent N139/E107. With the exception of
a few intrusive pieces of plastic and crab shell in Level 8,
historic materials are confined mainly to Level 1 with only a
small amount in Level 2 (see Table 13 in Appendix B). While
prehistoric sherds and debitage are found in appreciable
quantities in overlying levels, the vast majority of the prehistoric cultural material (including shell) is found in Level 5/
8, with smaller quantities immediately below in Level 6/9.
Combined artifact, bone, and Rangia shell totals from Level.s 5/8 and 6/9 in this unit are presented in plan view on
Figure 56. As on Figure 54 discussed earlier, this figure depicts the total quantity of Rangia by shading as indicated
on the key.

Quad G (Lot 272; see Radiocarbon Assays from 41HR121,
below).
A total of 118 sherds (111 untempered sandy paste, 1
Mandeville, and 6 O'Neal Plain, var. Conway) and 87 flakes
was recovered in this unit. In addition, a total of 1,854.4 g
(MNI = 266) of Rangia was also found.
As was the case for Unit N143/E99, there appears to be
a distinct differential distribution of artifacts and Rangia
shell that presumably reflects prehistoric cultural patterning. The highest density of Rangia shell was in the northeast quadrants (C, D, G, and H) with much smaller amounts
in the adjacent northwest quads (A, B, E, and F; see Figure
56). There may also be two other loci or concentrations of
Rangia in Quadrats I and 0. With the exception of Quadrats
0 and D, bone counts appear to strongly covary with Rangia
weight although whether this is preservational or cultural is

Chapter 7: Past and Present Investigations of the Southeast (Right) Bank of Buffalo Bayou

unclear. Density of ceramic sherds on the other hand is highest in Quads A and N where Rangia counts are low. The
pattern for lithics is less clearcut. A concentration of
microdebitage is found in Quadrats A and L with little or no
shell, while a similar number were recovered with abundant
shell in Quad G.
Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) shell was also recovered in appreciable quantities from prehistoric levels in Unit
N140/E108. Only traces were found elsewhere: 6.8 gin Level
6 of Test Unit 1and3.8 gin Quadrant DD, Level 5 in N143/
E99. A total of 211.3 g of oyster shell was recovered from
Levels 5/8 and 6/9 in N140/E108. The greatest concentration by far, 97 .9 g, was in Quad G (which also had the
highest mass of Rangia shell). Quads D and 0 had roughly
a third as much with smaller amounts in adjacent quadrats.
A specimen recovered in Quad I has a heavily worn edge
and may have been used as a knife or scraper (see AppendixE).
Although one must be cautious about reading too much
into such patterning over such a small area, the distributional data from Units N143/E99, N139/E107, andN140/E108
all suggest that these archeological materials remained in
place and may reflect actual prehistoric use or discard patterns. Redeposition, such as transport down a slope, can be
expected to homogenize ( "smear") or size sort artifacts. This
does not appear to have occurred at 41HR121. It does seem
likely that due to extensive bioturbation (e.g., earthworms
and roots) or soil wet/dry cycles, prehistoric artifacts have
been moved upward within the solum, while small historic
materials have been reworked downward. The underlying
Beaumont clays are less permeable and therefore block much
in the way of downward movement. Nevertheless, there does
appear to be good separation between the historic and prehistoric components in most areas within 4lHR121. The shell
lens( es) are least susceptible to movement. Their discreteness and discontinuous distribution cle!ifly imply that they
have remained in situ since they were buried, although prior
movement cannot be ruled out. The implications of these
findings, as well as the results of special analyses, are discussed in greater detail below.
EXCAVATIONUNITN137/E110
Excavation Unit N137/El 10 was placed off the northwestern edge of the small power line clearing or access road
on the upland margin (see Figure 47). It was positioned a
meter or so southwest of the shovel probe 0-line, on a relatively level area between Shovel Probes D-NE-0 and E-NE-0,
where the slight rise on which Units N139/E107 and N140/
E108 were placed drops down to the upland surface. It was
dug primarily to determine precisely how far cultural deposits extended back from the valley margin and the extent of
any disturbance related to the power line clearing. Shovel
Probes E-NE-0 and E-SW-5 were both negative for prehistoric artifacts and it was hoped that a limited excavation,

131

with better provenience controls, might confirm this. In order to achieve these objectives, only a portion of the unit
needed to be excavated, and consequently, a 25-cm square
grid was used, and only the southeastern quadrant of the
unit (Quads K, L, 0, and P) was excavated in Level 1. Subsequently, only Quads L and P were excavated in Levels 2
through 5. This is one example of the flexibility of the quadrat excavation and record-keeping system utilized during
TARL testing.
Only a single flake, presumably displaced, was found in
Level 2 (Table 14 in Appendix B). However, historic artifacts
were recovered as deep as Levels 4 and 5, although by far
the greatest concentration occurred in the upper two levels
along with abundant metal, bone, and crab claw fragments.
Heavily mottled (black silty clay and Beaumont Formation)
sediment was encountered at the base of Level 3, and beneath this only a single bone, a piece of glass, and piece of
plastic were recovered. These small artifacts could have easily been displaced by bioturbation, such as earthworms or
tree roots. The base of Level 5 was at an elevation below the
base of the shell and artifacts in nearby UnitN140/E108 (see
Appendix L). Given the density of historic material in the
upper levels, the virtual absence of prehistoric artifacts, and
the lack of evidence for disturbance related to the powerline
clearing and access road, it is likely that this unit does lie
outside of the main portion of site 41HR121. Although it is
possible that deeper levels may have yielded cultural remains, this possibility is considered remote. The sediment
was becoming increasingly mottled and the excavations were
ended in or just above intact Beaumont Formation deposits.
However, despite similar negative results for prehistoric
cultural material in Shovel Probe G-1 farther east on the upland surface (see Figure 44), soil chemistry analysis revealed
a distinct spike in available phosphate in Level 5 (98.2498.14 m) at about the same or lightly lower elevation as the
cultural shell lens in UnitN140/E108 on the valley margin.
This suggests that very low density archeological deposits
may be found farther back on the adjacent upland. If future
work is undertaken at the site, it would be advisable to scrape
or blade off swaths back from the upland margin (cf.
Weinstein 1991:208) in a search for such low-visibility archeological features or occupational surfaces that may have
been missed by Shovel Probes E-NE-0, E-SW-5, G-1, and the
quadrats in Unit N137/El 10. It is clear, though, that whatever deposits might be found there would probably be rather
ephemeral and quite unlike the distinctive thin buried shell
midden and cultural components on the valley margin and
slope.

Special Samples and Analysis
One of the objectives of additional testing at 41HR121/
576 in the spring of 1998 was the testing of several analytical
techniques that might be used in anticipated future excavation efforts. This was primarily done within the context of

132

learning as much as possible from the current investigations
but evaluating the efficacy and relative worth of different
analytical techniques and field methods was emphasized as
well. Bulk sediment samples for flotation were collected, and
in tum subsamples for ostracode, phytolith/diatom, pollen,
and soil chemistry and granulometry analyses were taken
from them. In addition, all floated sediment was screened
through 1/16-inch mesh and picked under lOX magnification and recovered materials submitted to the appropriate
analysts (e.g., ceramics, lithics, and faunal remains). Oriented
sediment samples were collected for soil micromorphological analysis, and field measurements of magnetic susceptibility were taken.
It was determined that sampling for most analyses
would focus on two primary columns, one within the site
and one outside it. Consequently, 25-x-25-cm Quadrat M,
in the southwestern comerof Unit Nl 40/ElOS, was left as a
balk unit from which bulk sediment samples and soil
micromorhology samples were collected at the close of excavations. In addition, bulk sediment samples were also
collected from individual provenience units within the prehistoric shell lens( es) in this unit in order to discern internal patterning in the distribution of artifacts or other remains. In addition, selected proveniences in other units
and a column of bulk sediment samples were also collected
from levels in Shovel Probe G-1, east of the site on the
upland in an area apparently devoid of artifacts. A second
pair of soil micromorphology columns was sampled from
the Section 4 profile along the Ditch Witch trench (see
Figures 47 and 52). A single micromorphology sample was
also collected from what was at first believed to be a feature in Test Unit 1 but was later determined to be a small
burrow or tree root disturbance. Finally, multiple readings
of the magnetic susceptibility of the sediment exposed in
profile and at the base of excavation levels were also taken,
but these required no collection of a sample. The proveniences of all analyzed bulk sediment and flotation samples
and the subsamples submitted from each for particular
analyses, are presented in Table 15 in Appendix B. The
locations of soil micromorphology samples are given on
Table 16 in Appendix B.
A total of 27 bulk sediment samples were floated and
processed (see Table 15 in Appendix B). The initial volume
of each sample was obtained, and then subsamples were
taken for various analyses or for curation: 0.1 liter for soil
chemistry/granulometry and pollen analysis and 0.05 liter
for ostracode and phytolith/diatom analyses. Whenever
possible, 0.5 to 1.0 liter of sediment was retained for curation,
and the remainder was floated and screened through 1/16inch mesh. A portion of all bulk sediment samples that were
not processed have been retained for curation along with all
unused subsamples.
Macrobotanical analysis was not performed on specimens recovered during flotation. The objective of floating
these samples was primarily to determine the presence or

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

absence of macrobotanical remains. Recovery demonstrated
the presence of macrofloral remains, which appear to be a
mix of intrusive modem and probable prehistoric materials.
However, context was not very well controlled, and the limited horizontal exposures rendered intrasite patterning uncertain. All samples are curated in anticipation of future investigations.
Faunal recovery from the 17 1/16-inch screen fractions
analyzed were disappointing. Bone was recovered in all but
two of the samples, but only a few sheepshead (Archosargus
probatocephalus) teeth could be identified. The remaining
specimens were too fragmentary for identification, although
a few pieces could be attributed to larger mammals (see Appendix G). Evidence of burning was noted in 8 of the 14 lots
examined which contained bone.
No meaningful results were obtained from the ostracode
(see Appendix K), phytolith, or diatom (see Appendix I) studies, and they therefore have been eliminated from consideration for future work. Soil chemistry and granulometry data
were somewhat more helpful. In particular, the cultural zone
was accompanied by a sharp increase in available phosphate (Table 17 in Appendix B). Interestingly, this was also
noted not only on-site but also in a sample over 40 cm below
the surface in Shovel Probe G-1 more than 15 m southeast of
the site, on the upland. This available phosphate spike occurs at approximately the same elevation as it does in Unit
N140/E108, but no artifacts or shell were noted. This suggests that some low-density living surface or other segment
of the buried prehistoric site may exist farther back on th.e
upland. The decrease in organic matter with depth noted in
the chemical assays is also seen in the soil micromorphology samples.
A spike was noted in a pollen sample from just beneath the shell lens (Lot 307), on or very near the weathered upper surface of the Beaumont Formation Facies 1
clays (see Appendix J). These results were later confirmed
in an unprovenienced handsample taken for sediment description. In contrast to the samples from above and below, these samples yielded a well-preserved pollen spectrum including species not now found in the immediate site
area (see Appendix J). The pollen preservation is accompanied by a slightly lower pH as well, although overlying
sediments with similar acidities did not yield pollen. This
result is puzzling but a potential answer may be that the
Beaumont erosional surface is less permeable than the overlying black silt clay. This was observed in the wall profiles
of excavation units during and after rainstorms when
groundwater seeped in along the unconformable contact
in the unit profiles. It is possible that these enhanced pollen spectra might be attributable to highly localized wet,
anaerobic conditions. Alternative explanations include recent replenishment from the biosphere, but this cannot
account for the mode of introduction and the absence of
similar spectra in upper levels. If additional work is performed at 41HR121 and pollen samples are positive, the

Chapter 7: Past and Present Investigations of the Southeast (Right) Bank of Buffalo Bayou

pollen grains themselves may be directly radiocarbon dated
by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry to resolve the potential
contamination question.
Soil micromorphology study involves examining a thin
section from a hardened soil block. A great deal of information can be obtained in this way, including details of pedogenic alteration and cultural inputs of microscopic ash
and charcoal (e.g., Courty et al. 1989). The analyses from the
two columns at 41HR121 demonstrated that the upper, black
silty clays were largely decalcified, that little evidence could
be seen for downslope dislocation of natural or cultural inclusions, and that the sediments had been well mixed and
bioturbated by earthworms (see Appendix H). The "sister"
subcolumn from each column has been impregnated and
curated for possible future analysis. The two columns (from
Section 4 and Unit N140/E108) were quite similar with only
minor local differences. Dissolution of carbonate in the upper Holocene sediment is apparently due to pedogenesis
and groundwater, while less-complete decalcification of the
underlying Beaumont sediment is likely due to weathering.
No clear indications of in situ burning were noted, although
advanced decalcification would be expected to remove calcitic ash rhombs.
In addition to the above analyses, multiple readings of
the bulk magnetic susceptibility of the sediment at the base
of each level were taken using a small, battery-operated handheld instrument; an Exploranium KT-9 Kappameter. Magnetic susceptibility is a measure of the degree to which a
substance can be magnetized (Dalan and Banerjee 1998:6)
and is expressed as a ratio of the induced magnetization to
the strength of the small magnetizing field. Susceptibility is
a sensitive indicator of changes in ferromagnetic mineralogy of a sample, typically represented by iron oxides such
as magnetite and hematite. Enhancement of magnetic susceptibility is a common feature of pedogenesis and the burning or decay of organic matter (e.g., McClean and Kean 1993;
Singer and Fine 1989). It was hoped that magnetic susceptibility readings, in the absence of other indications, might
provide a means of recognizing ephemeral hearths or burned
areas. However, the results were disappointing. Although
literally hundreds of readings were taken, little patterned
variation in measured values could be discerned, with the
obvious exception of markedly higher values in upper historic levels containing metal fragments. While it is possible
(and perhaps even likely) that TARL testing did not encounter an intact burned feature, there are other possible factors
including the sensitivity of the instrument under field conditions. Despite the disappointing results from this initial study,
future investigations at 41HR121 or elsewhere in the project
area might benefit from a similar search for localized magnetic susceptibiltiy enhancement. However, the advanced
decalcification of the cultural matrix noted in the micromorphological analysis suggests that any remains of calcitic
ashes would have been destroyed.

133

Artifacts at 41HR576
The historic artifacts recovered from 41HR576 represent essentially the two components defined by Moore
(Heartfield, Price and Greene, Inc. 1986). In fact, in many
cases, exactly the same types of artifacts were recovered,
such as the Shenango hotel ware ceramics from the San Jacinto
Inn (see Appendix F). The same is true for the historic artifacts in the Neyland Collection erroneously assigned to
41HR121. No evidence for earlier time periods relating to
early Texas history were recognized. The structural foundations probably represent late-nineteenth or early-twentiethcentury light industry or farming. The historic materials in
the vicinity of 41HR121 were found to be fairly well separated vertically from the prehistoric remains. A representative sample of these materials, with good provenience information, has been collected and curated as a result of TARL
investigations so that later investigations at 41HR121 may
strip away much of the overburden mechanically in order to
maximize data recovery.

Ceramics and Absolute Dating of 4JHR121
and 41HR33
The issue of dating sites 41HR121and41HR33 is taken
up in this section, prior to a consideration of their possible
relationship to each other and to other sites in the Galveston
Bay area. Site 4lHR121 is considered first, including results
from three radiocarbon assays on shell.
DATING41HR121
Ceramic artifacts recovered from 41HRl21 include a wide
variety of nongrog-tempered pottery types typical of the
early Ceramic period sites in the Upper Galveston Bay (Aten
1983a). Untyped Goose Creek body sherds dominate (Table
18 in Appendix B ). Lacking evidence for or against decoration, it is not possible to determine whether they are plain or
some other type (see Appendix D). One Goose Creek Incised rim sherd was recovered. One or two specimens of
other early types such as Goose Creek, var. Anahuac and
Mandeville Plain also occur. After the untempered sandypaste wares, the most common type is O'Neal Plain, var.
Conway, with a total of 11 sherds (or 3.3 percent of the total).
It is perhaps significant to note that these early types are
not concentrated in a single area but were instead recovered
from prehistoric levels in four different excavation units (Test
Unit 1, N139/El07, N140/E108, andN143/E99). The presence
and percentages of these ceramic types are consistent with
an occupation(s) of 41HR121 that dates to the early Clear
Lake period (ca. A.D. 100 - 425) in the Galveston Bay local
ceramic chronology (following Aten 1983a).
The lithic artifacts are mainly limited to small chert flakes
and debitage (highly variable in color). The two projectile

134

points recovered during TARL investigations were too fragmentary or reworked to be of chronological utility, although
neither is inconsistent with an inferred Clear Lake period
occupation(s). Moderate amounts of bone were recovered,
but unlike 41 HR33 no modified bone artifacts (also diagnostic of the Early Ceramic) were recovered (see Appendix E).
The presence of appreciable quantities of oyster
( Crassostrea virginica) shell in the shell lens in Unit Nl 40/
E108 is also consistent with an early time frame. This more
saline-tolerant species suggests that local conditions (at
least in Upper Galveston Bay) at the time of occupation may
have been somewhat more saline. A general trend toward
decreasing salinity through time in the project area has been
inferred due to the growth and maturation of the barrier island complex. However, the presence of oyster could also
simply indicate human transport from farther down Galveston
Bay.
RADIOCARBON ASSAYS FROM 41HR121
Based on ceramic recovery site 41HR121 components
appear to fall primarily, or perhaps entirely, within the earliest Ceramic (or Clear Lake) period. While Aten's ceramic
typology has been criticized, or at least seriously questioned,
in terms of its use as an absolute chronology (e.g., Gadus
and Howard 1990; Ricklis 1994; Weinstein 1991), it is nonetheless widely used as a relative seriation tool. The uncertainties regarding absolute dates revolve around multiple
factors having to do with radiocarbon determinations on
Rangia shell. Several excellent summaries of the issues involved and possible resolutions of problems related to radiocarbon determinations on brackish water shells in the
Galveston Bay area are available (Aten 1983a:329-341; Ensor
1998; Howard et al. 1991: 11-14; Kibler et al. 1996:54-62; Ricklis
1994:17-21).
The dates Aten used in building his chronology were
not corrected for isotopic fractionation (1 3C/ 12C), nor were
calendrical calibrations applied. Based on the average fractionation values of 23 Rangia shell samples at Peggy Lake
(Gadus and Howard 1990), which range from -1.6 to -8.4,
such corrections would add anywhere from 270 to 390 years
(average= 317) to Aten 's dated periods. Furthermore, Aten
has now adjusted his chronology to calibrated years and
currently estimates the beginning and end dates for the Clear
Lake and Mayes Island periods at 200 B.C. to A.D. 100 and
A.n. 100 to 300, respectively (Lawrence E. Aten, personal
communication 1998). Aten's dates were originally tree-ring
calibrated after Seuss ( 1970).
Following Ambler's (1973:138-143)previous recognition
of the apparent discrepency between paired charcoal and
Rangia shell dates, Aten (1983a:329-341) developed a reservoir correction factor of 225 years to account for the incorporation of ancient carbon from inland limestone sources.
Aten (1983a:329-341) calculated an average reservoir correction factor (225 Â± 103 years) using shell/charcoal pairs,

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

but as noted, many researchers now contend that his dates
are too young (see discussion in Kibler et al. 1996:54-62).
Different opinions exist on when and where such local reservoir factors should be used (e.g., Ensor 1998; Howard et al.
1991: 11-14). Another potential source of "dead" carbon is
carbonate-rich Beaumont Formation sediments (Aten
1983a:341). A final source of contention is whether atmospheric or marine calibrations should be used, with or without a correction factor (see review and comparison of three
different approaches in Ensor 1998).
However, since these issues remain unresolved, and
since neither Buffalo Bayou nor the San Jacinto River are
likely sources of dissolved carbonate, no reservoir correction factor or standard corrections were applied to the
41HR121 radiocarbon determinations, all of which were run
on Rangia shell (Table 19 in Appendix B). Aten (personal
communication 1998) concurs, suggesting that the -225 local reservoir correction factor should only be used on the
lower Trinity River and perhaps upper Trinity Bay. The
41HR121 dates, however, have been corrected for fractionation (d 13C %0) (Table 19 in Appendix B). Two different calibrations have been used: a standard global average marine
calibration provided by Beta-Analytic and a non-marine (atmospheric) correction (Stuiver et al. 1998) derived using
CALIB v4.0 (Stuiver and Reimer 1993).
The global marine calibrated dates for the three 41HR121
samples range between cal 700 B.C. and cal A.D. 35 at twosigma (95 percent) confidence level. Calibrated two-sigma
results for the Beta-120605 and Beta-120606 samples do not
overlap, although the Beta-120604 result bridges this gap.
Note that the calibration curves used are relatively flat in the
ca. 1,000-year period between conventional radiocarbon ages
2800 to 2700 B.P., contributing to the greater uncertainty in
their calendrical ages.
The atmospheric calibrated dates are significantly older.
The same pattern of older ages for non-marine calibrations
without reservoir correction has been noted by Ensor
(1998:Table 1-2). The41HR121 intercepts range between cal
500 B.c. and cal 960 B.c. with one-sigma ranges between cal
420 B.C. and cal 1040 B.c. (see Table 19 in Appendix B). Again,
the UnitN140/El08 and UnitN143/E99 dates do not overlap
and, while the Test Unit 2 sample bridges the gap between
them, it does just barely.
It appears that these results may be too old due to contamination with "dead" carbonate derived from the underlying Beaumont Formation. This is especially problematic for
the midslope (Nl43/E99) and downslope (Test Unit 2)
samples which may be in somewhat closer proximity to the
older Beaumont facies and weathered surfaces (cf. Figures
51 and 52). Micromorphological analysis of the sediments
did indicate extensive bioturbation by earthworms, which
could be a mechanism for the introduction of older, contaminating carbonate (see Appendix H). However, the same analysis also demonstrated advanced decalcification of the Holocene sediment (including the cultural deposits), presum-

Chapter 7: Past and Present Investigations of the Southeast (Right) Bank of Buffalo Bayou

ably due to pedogenesis, as well as weathering and partial
decalcification of the upper Beaumont Formation sediments.
So another possibility is that downslope movement of dissolved carbonates differentially affect downslope shell as
groundwater runs along the more impermeable surface of
the Beaumont. Despite these problems, the dates are at least
loosely clustered and at least partially reflect the actual antiquity of the Clear Lake period. In conclusion, although the
radiocarbon dates from 41HR121 may be contaminated to
some degree with older carbonate they are fairly well clustered and consistent with an earlier (e.g., Clear Lake period)
occupation as indicated by the ceramic assemblage.
DATING41HR33
No radiocarbon determinations have been run on the
41HR33 Neyland collection materials. However, the ceramic
and bone tool assemblages clearly indicate an early Ceramic
period occupation.
Overall the entire 41HR33 collection, both the vessels
and loose sherds, is characterized by a remarkable lack of
decoration and a predominance of sandy-paste Goose Creek
wares (see Table 18 in Appendix B). Less than one-half of 1
percent (n=lO of2,380 of the total sherds, or0.4 percent) of
the assemblage is grog-tempered. The two grog-tempered
vessels (Vessel 21 and Vessel C) were recovered
stratigraphically above the main shell lens(es) and a grogtempered flat, noded base sherd was also recovered above
the shell lens in Square W5-1 O'. The dissociation of the later
grog-tempered wares from the main shell midden accumulation further contributes to the uniformity of the ceramic collection.
The early ceramic types (O'Neal Plain, var. Conway and
Goose Creek, var. Anahuac) recovered 3 inches above the
shell lens in Unit S 10/W30 were probably displaced from
upslope erosion. However, their presence, along with the
small quantities of other types such as Tchefuncte, Goose
Creek Incised, and Goose Creek Red-filmed, strongly suggest a late Clear Lake or Mayes Island occupation of 41HR33
(Aten 1983a).
The early ceramic age for 41HR33 is also supported by
the fairly large number of modified bone tools (see Appendix E). In particular, at least two socketed bone projectile
points (and perhaps four others) were recovered and are
characteristic of Early Ceramic period occupations and last
until the early Turtle Bay period (Aten 1983a:302-304). Other
bone tools include awls, ulna tools, a compound fishhook
barb, antler apparently used as a flaking tool, and some bone
tool manufacturing debris.
The situation is not as clear-cut for the projectile points
(see Appendix C). Clear Lake or Mayes Island occupations
should be characterized primarily by dart point types such
as Gary or Kent. Arrow points were introduced in the latter
stages of the Mayes Island period (Aten 1983a:304). However, a number of projectiles in the 41HR33 Neyland Collec-

135

ti on have been identified as arrow points. Several, however,
while their proveniences do not clearly indicate they were
found above the shell lens, nonetheless tend to be in the
upper part of the shell. For example, the lone Perdiz point
(33PP-9) was reported to be from a "shell layer mixed with
black clay" (presumably the black silty clay sediment). Likewise, projectile point 33PP-10 (classified as Aten Class A-1)
was reported to have a vertical provenience of 0-10 inches
but an added notation indicates that it is from the "shell
layer in upper (black strata)."
The caveats regarding Neyland's provenience information outlined earlier in the chapter must of course be remembered. Overall, however, the Goose Creek-dominated ceramic
assemblage and the presence of socketed bone points definitely support the inference of an Early Ceramic period date
for41HR33.
RELATIONSHIP OF 41HR121AND41HR33 'ID
EACHOTIIBR
The ceramic assemblages from sites 41HR33 (Neyland
Collection)and41HR121 (from the 1997-1998 TARLinvestigations) are remarkably similar (see Table 18 in Appendix B ).
Both are certainly consistent with early Ceramic period
occupation(s). The only recognized grog-tempered ceramics (all from 41HR33) are apparently from stratigraphic levels
above the main shell midden which yielded the majority of
the artifacts. The slightly higher percentages of early ceramic types at 41HR121 may indicate a somewhat earlier occupation, but it seems more likely that both sites were occupied at or about the same time. They may in fact be different
"site areas" similar to the contemporaneous bankline midden
(initial food processing) area and valley margin shell "pockets" (primary habitation) areas recognized at the Lido Harbor (41GV82) site (Weinstein 1991). The entire complex of
bankline sites recorded by Neyland in the 1950s may have at
one time all served essentially the same function for sites
along the valley slope and upland which are now eroded
away or are so small or ephemeral that they are difficult to
find (cf. Weinstein 1991). The possibility that similar relationships existed between different site types at Peggy Lake
and elsewhere would appear to be a potentially fruitful avenue ofresearch. Unfortunately, within the project area and
especially along the Houston Ship Channel, as was the case
along this portion of the southeastern bank of Buffalo Bayou,
it is highly unlike that many of the large bankline or terrace
middens have survived. In this instance, the Neyland Collection provides at least some data on the sites that formerly
existed nearby.
Thefaunalremains from41HR33 and41HR121 are similar (Table 20 in Appendix B). Both sites yielded several species of fish. Site 41HR33 had a large number of various turtle
species, while the smaller site has so far only yielded a single
turtle. Predominating at both sites are white-tailed deer
(Odocoileus viginianus) and unidentifiable deer-sized mam-

136

mal remains. The ubiquity of Rangia and deer, with smaller
numbers of (or at least evidence for) fish, is common at prehistoric coastal sites (e.g., Patterson 1996). Of the 117 proveniences from 41HR121/576 that yielded bone, 62 (or ca. 53
percent) had some evidence of burned bone (see Appendix
G). Eliminating the obviously historic proveniences (e.g.,
crab claws and domestic chicken bones) and specimens from
Levels 1 and 2 in each of the seven excavation units leaves
a total of 88 proveniences of which only half (n=44) contained burned bone. There does not appear to be any pattern to the distribution of burned bone. In contrast, only 10
percent of the bone from 41 HR33 was found to be burned to
any noticable extent. These results provide some support to
the inference that the upslope site (41HR121) may reflect
more emphasis on food preparation and cooking as opposed
to initial processing (at the bankline sites like 41HR33).
The recovered lithic artifacts from 41HR121 and 41HR33
are consistent with Late Prehistoric occupations at the sites.
The debitage assemblage from each site seems to represent
varying stages oflithic reduction at each site. At 41HR33, all
reduction stages are represented while the assemblage from
41HRl21 clearly represents primarily late stages of lithic reduction. The high frequency of tertiary flakes indicates only
limited trimming orresharpening at 41HR12 l. Furthermore,
low frequency oflithic material at the site is consistent with
the inferred short-term occupation(s) although only a small
portion of the site has been investigated thus far. While the
occupation of 41HR121 appears to be short term, the higher
tool count and presence of siltstone at 41HR33 may reflect
more diverse activities or discard patterns.
RELATIONSHIPOF41HR121AND41HR3310
01HERSITES
An introduction to small-site archeology on the Upper
Texas Coast has been presented in Chapter 5 and is be repeated here. Instead, specific attributes of small-sites that
have been investigated are compared and contrasted to
41HR121 in terms of site structure, age, and possible relationships to other nearby sites.
The possible analogy between the Lido Harbor site
(41GV82, Weinstein 1991) areas and41HR121/41HR33 have
been discussed. However, if in fact such a relationship does
exist, then as Weinstein points out, both 41 GV82 and
41HR121 differ functionally, and probably structurally, from
the "hearth-midden couplet" sites (41CH31and41CH170)
excavated by Aten (1983b) in the lower Trinity River. In other
words, without a primary habitation site nearby, the structure of a small, single-use camp might be fundamentally different from a site with subareas of primary food processing
refuse and of primary habitation nearby. The latter areas
would be expected to perhaps have different artifact classes,
or at least unique spatial relationships between them if
middens were used as secondary refuse areas as well (cf.
Weinstein 1991).

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

For example, Aten ( 1983b: 18, 30) proposed that lithic
debitage and bone/shell artifacts should be associated with
the hearth areas (where knapping presumably took place)
while bone refuse and ceramics (if present) would be discarded along with the shell. However, at the Redtail site
(Gad us and Howard 1990: 181) it appeared instead that ceramics and lithics were distributed around and slightly overlapping the shell features. The multicomponent nature of
that site, and the 1-m resolution unfortunately limited the
inferences that confidently could be made. On the other
hand, intensive excavation of a "discrete habitation unit"
(Shell Pocket 4) at Lido Harbor (Weinstein 1991: 185-195)
revealed what Weinstein termed varying discard activities
and functional areas. Specifically, he found that while vertebrate remains were randomly discarded around and in
the shell pocket, ceramic and lithic artifacts reflecting food
preparation and/or food storage activities were concentrated around the periphery of the shell refuse pile. Other
activities such as tool manufacture and tool maintenance
also probably occurred along the edge and outside of the
discarded shell. Larger, unsalvageable fragments of broken ceramics were tossed in with the shell. While too small
an area has been exposed to make similar inferences with
any measure of confidence, there does appear to be evidence for some horizontal differentiation of artifact classes.
The concentration of ceramics along the eastern half of
Unit Nl39/El07 and the apparent association of shell and
bone on the one hand, and ceramics and lithics on the
other, in adjacent Unit Nl40/El08 are provocative. Similarly, in Unit N l 43/E99, shell concentrations are greater in
the northern quadrants while ceramics predominate in the
southern half. As mentioned above, the evident distribution of artifact types and shell at 41HR121 suggests not
only that it is intact but also that it has significant potential
to yield detailed intrasite spatial patterning.
Another factor that appears to contribute to 41HR121 's
potential in this regard is the discreteness of the shell deposits. The site appears to represent only one or a few limited occupations over a relatively brief interval of time (or at
least only within the early Ceramic period). There is no evidence for overlapping site components and the discontinuous lensing suggests individual "habitation" or depositional
episodes might be readily identified. The Redtail site on the
other hand was reoccupied at least five times over a period
of 1,300 years representing "continual through intermittent
use of the site by small groups" (Gadus and Howard
1990:182). The shell deposits were thicker, and it was difficult to associate artifacts to specific occupations and shell
piles. At Lido Harbor, distinct individual shell pockets representing "extremely short-term visits to the site" (Weinstein
1991 :174) were found. However, this site too was apparently
reoccupied over a period of approximately 800 years, from
the end of the Turtle Bay period to the middle Old River
period. Meager artifact inventories at sites 41CH170 and
41 CH31 complicated the estimation of their age, but a radio-

Chapter 7: Past and Present Investigations of the Southeast (Right) Bank of Buffalo Bayou

carbon date from the former placed it in the Turtle Bay-Round
Lake period transition (Aten l 983b:9), while the ceramic assemblage at the latter suggested a middle Old River period
occupation. The hearth-midden couplet from Area A at
41HR85 is only incompletely reported (Aten l 983b ). Unlike
the Redtail and Lido Harbor sites, 41HR121 appears to have
been occupied only a few times over a brief period. And, in
constrast to the two Trinity Delta sites, 41HR121 represents
an earlier occupation than either of them. Finally, the thinness of the shell deposits rival those at Lido Harbor and
41CH170.
Weinstein suggests that the bankline midden at Lido
Harbor was both a primary food processing and a trash disposal area. If 41HR33 functioned in the same capacity for
valley slope and upland margin sites nearby (such as
41HR121) then few internal features would be expected.
Unfortunately, while the provenience resolution and samples
from Neyland's investigations preclude a definitive assessment, few obvious internal features appear to have been
encountered. Staying with the strength of the collection, it
might also be expected that few complete vessels would be
expected if the pieces were not discarded together, or they
did not break in situ. Again, while provenience ambiguities
limit inferences somewhat, a more-focused distributional
analysis of refits within the vessel and loose sherd collections might successfully address this question.
The ability to accurately date site 41HR121 will clearly
help guide any future research at the site. The ceramic evidence suggests that occupation(s) at the site were confined
exclusively to the Clear Lake, and perhaps Mayes Island
periods. Site 41HR121 appears to offer a potential opportunity toinvestigate discrete habitation components with spatial resolution on the order of sites 41CH31and41CH170in
the Trinity River Delta (Aten 1983b) or the individual shell
"pockets" at Lido Harbor (Weinstein 1991). The early time
period of the 41HR121 component, however, appears to be
unique among the small sites previously excavated in
Galveston Bay area (see Chapter 5).
Summary
The analyses of curated artifact collections and notes
from investigations by Wayne B. Neyland in the late 1950s
along the southeastern bank of Buffalo Bayou revealed a
remarkable ceramic vessel collection and the existence of
much valuable data on a complex of sites here and elsewhere
in the project area. TARL fieldwork along this portion of
Buffalo Bayou confirmed that none of the bankline midden
sites defined by Neyland has survived extensive erosion

137

and subsidence. This fieldwork did result in the discovery
and definition of a thin shell midden remnant_ofNeyland site
41HR121 on the valley slope. In addition, historic artifacts
relating to a multicomponent historic site (41HR576) were
discovered overlying and partially overlapping the more
deeply buried prehistoric site. Finally, additional TARL testing helped refined possible methods and analyses that may
be useful for planning and undertaking future research.
The results of both the original survey and the advanced testing at 41HR121 are consistent with expectations
for an intact prehistoric site with evidence oflimited occupational intensity. Furthermore, diagnostic ceramics suggest
that those occupations probably occurred only during the
Clear Lake period, the earliest documented ceramic period in
the Galveston Bay area. It now appears that there is a central
area of higher shell density but that the shell lenses are
neither continuous nor thick. The upper slope and margin of
the site also has shell lenses, but these may be smaller and
more circumscribed than those lower on the slope. A lack of
size sorting of artifacts across the site suggests little or no
downslope dislocation or movement. Micromorphological
analysis indicates no evidence for downslope movement or
for bedding planes, although they may have been erased by
extensive earthworm bioturbation. The Rangia shells, while
brittle (perhaps due to postdepositional dissolution), are
relatively restricted in size and are mostly whole. The condition of the shell, the discreteness and thinness of the shell
lens, and the distribution of the artifacts and shell all support the interpretation that 41HR121 is an intact site composed of one or a few short-duration occupations. In addition, detailed data on the depth and extent of the cultural
remains can, if necessary, accurately guide mechanical removal of the overlying sediments.
Additional testing also confirmed that the component
of historic site 41HR576 in the immediate vicinity of 41HR121
is composed solely of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth
century artifacts as well as restaurant debris dating to the
last 30 to 70 years. However, 41HR576 is clearly a multicomponent site of which the San Jacinto Inn dumping may be
only a minor factor.
The following chapter places these findings in the context of past and current research in the project. The potential
of site 41HR121 and selected portions of 41HR576 to address significant research issues outlined in the Comprehensive Historic Preservation Plan (Kibler et al. 1996) are
then discussed. Finally, after considering each site's eligibility for National Register of Historic Places listing, the outline of a detailed mitigation plan for conducting future research at these two sites is presented.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

This chapter summarizes TARL resurvey and testing at
10 sites in the project area. The eligibility of each of these
localities for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places is assessed, and recommendations for or against further research at each are presented. Specific recommendations for additional field and/or archival research at two sites
(41HR121and41HR576) are discussed along with field and
laboratory methods that might be employed. Finally, the
potential ofusing curated collections (like the 41HR33 vessel assemblage) and documentary evidence (particularly from
sites that no longer exist) to contribute to our understanding of Upper Texas Coast prehistory is considered and
strongly endorsed.
The sites are discussed in the same order as in Chapters
6 and 7, from Morgans Point to Buffalo Bayou. Historic site
41HR576 is again considered along with the other sites along
the southeastern (right) bank of Bufalo Bayou (41HR33,
41HR104,41HR105, and41HR121). General locations of all
site localities are given on Figure 1 as well as various maps
and figures in Chapters 6 and 7.

41HR685 (ATKINSON ISLAND)
Site 41HR685 was reported in 1990 as the result of a
survey of Upper Galveston Bay by members of the Houston
Archeological Society. It was described as a prehistoric shell
midden on the north shore of Atkinson Island and was also
reported to have evidence of nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century historic occupations.
Atkinson Island was formed in the mid 1870s by the
excavation of a canal or cut through Morgan's Point peninsula in order to bypass Clopper's Bar, a significant barrier to
navigation. The gap between the island and Morgans Point
has widened considerably since that time through both
dredging of the Houston Ship Channel and lateral erosion
caused by passing ships. A relative abundance of cartographic and aerial photographic information on Morgans

Point and surrounding areas is available. A review of this
evidence indicated some possibility that intact historic or
prehistoric deposits might exist at 41HR685. The lack of
modem development and the absence of dredged sediment
disposal in the immediate site area were additional factors
suggesting an increased chance of site preservation. However, the effects of severe local subsidence (due to development of a nearby oil field beginning around 1918) along with
erosion and reworking of the northern beach suggested that
these deposits were probably at or below the water line and
only small portions, if any, of the original site areas would
remain accessible. Shoreline changes have been dramatic,
even within the last 10 or 15 years.
Evidence for historic occupations of the island include
a ca. 1870s-era shipyard in the immediate site area as well as
small, nearby buildings mapped early this century. In addition, there may be remains related to the New Washington
townsite (established in 1834 and subsequently burned by
the Mexican Anny in 1836 just prior to the Battle of San
Jacinto) or to a later occupation by James Morgan of the
nearby bluff.
The site was relocated during the 1997 TARL resurvey,
and a significant amount of fieldwork was undertaken to
evaluate the site and its depositional history. These investigations included pedestrian survey and the excavation of
nearly two dozen shovel and auger tests as well as a small,
hand-dug trench. Although both prehistoric and historic
artifacts were recovered, all came from disturbed or secondary contexts. In addition, analysis of the surface and subsurface deposits, combined with cartographic and aerial
photographic evidence, clearly indicate that any intact cultural deposits are now up to 1 meter below the water line.
Continued erosion and reworking of these and later sediments make it unlikely that archeologically intact and significant deposits survive or are reasonably accessible. The
short-lived historic occupations now lie, for the most part,
offshore. Prior to inundation, the structures and other im-

139

provements would have been subject to the full force of
hurricanes and floods on this low landform.
The site originally defined as 4 IHR685 is a natural deposit of sand and shell, sorted by wave action and containing eroded and redeposited artifacts. Therefore, it is not
eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places under Section 106 criteria, and no further fieldwork is
recommended at this site. However, during the course of the
TARL investigations, references (e.g., Muir 1958:13-17;
Roemer 1935:53-62) to occupations, historic events, and/or
land use of the 41HR685 area and Morgans Point were encountered that were not discussed in recent historic studies
(Hoyt et al. 1998; Kibler et al. 1996; Schmidt and Foster 1997).
Therefore, anyone interested in adding additional detail to
the historic research of the 41HR685/Morgans Point area is
encouraged to search beyond the documents referenced in
this and the aforementioned reports.

41HR681 (HOG ISLAND)
Site 41HR681 lies immediately across the Cedar Bayou
Channel from 41HR685 and was recorded as a prehistoric
midden in 1990 by members of the Houston Archeological
Society. Aerial photos and topographic maps clearly show
that the southern end of Hog Island did not originally extend this far south and that the site lies entirely on madeland
derived from channel dredging. Pedestrian survey and examination of natural cutbanks at this site yielded no prehistoric artifacts. All available evidence indicates that any prehistoric artifacts recovered at this location were secondarily
deposited. Based on dredge disposal patterns and erosion
observed on historic maps and aerial photos, it is likely that
these artifacts came from nearby inundated cultural sediments, although their precise origin cannot be determined.
The 41HR681 locality is a natural sand and shell beach
accumulation on madeland and is not eligible for nomination
to the National Register of Historic Places. No further work
is recommended. Note that this recommendation applies only
to the purported prehistoric site, the status of historic occupations and structures (none of which occur in the immediate 4 IHR681 area) is addressed elsewhere (Hoyt et al. 1998;
Schmidt and Foster 1997).

41HR680 (SPILMANS ISLAND)
Site 41 HR680 was also recorded in 1990 as a prehistoric
Rangia shell midden by members of the Houston Archeological Society. It was reported to be a shell midden nearly 1/
2-mile (ca. 800 m) long along the north shore of Spilmans
Island. Historic occupation(s) of the island began as early
as 1830 and was apparently limited to a single residence,
small-scale farming, and perhaps stock raising. Occupation
probably ceased by about 1900, and land use this century
has primarily been as a dredge disposal area.
TARL investigations at 41HR680 included pedestrian

survey of the sand beach, four shovel probes, and two auger transects. Subsurface testing began on the beach and
continued shoreward, within an area of dredged material
deposition along this shore. No prehistoric artifacts were
recovered, and the collections made in 1990 when the site
was recorded have not been available for examination. A
few areas of scattered Rangia shell and twentieth-century
historic artifacts were noted but were not in primary context.
Aerial photos and shoreline data from topographic maps
indicate that significant westward erosion has occurred due
to ship wakes and probable subsidence. The current shoreline is composed almost entirely of redeposited dredged
material. A small segment, near the eastern end of the site in
the vicinity of the historic residence, is protected by a rock
retaining wall to retard erosion. Intact, original surfaces were
not found in any of the test probes (several of which ex~
tended to or below the water line) nor were any indications
of the nineteenth-century historic residence. It appears likely
that the combination of erosion, subsidence, or storms (cf.
Schmidt and Foster 1997) have destroyed or inundated any
historic and prehistoric land surfaces.
Site 41HR680 is a natural shell beach with redeposited
artifacts on and in it and has little or no research potential.
Therefore, 41HR680 is not eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, and no further work is
recommended. Again, it seems likely that some additional
data on the historic occupation(s), ownership, and land use
of Spilmans Island, beyond those summarized in existing
historic reports (Hoyt et al. 1998; Kibler et al. 1996; Schmidt
and Foster 1997) might be available. A few were noted during the course of TARL investigations (e.g., de Cordova
1858:122;Looscan 1915:45).

41HR405 (GOATISLAND,A.K.A.
ST. MARY'S ISLAND)
Site 41HR405 was recorded in 1978 by personnel of
Cultural Resource Services, Inc. (Hudson 1979) on Goat Island (a.k.a. St. Mary's Island) near Scott Bay. It was described as a Rangia and oyster shell midden covering the
eastern 80 percent of the island, and additional testing was
recommended. However, the site could not be located again
during a follow-up survey five years later by the same archeologists, who concluded that the site had been completely
eroded during the interim (Hudson 1983). Unfortunately, no
copy of (or even reference to) the later report were included
in the site file at TARL. Consequently, compilations of potentially intact archeological sites in the project area (Foster
et al. 1993; Kibler et al. 1996) continued to rely on the earlier
recommendations.
The difficulties in assessing archeological localities in
the project area are amply illustrated by 41HR405. In addition to the dynamic landscape transformations brought about
by erosion, subsidence, and human activities, cartographic
errors initially complicated the TARL investigations. The

Chapter 8: Conclusions and Recommendations

"Goat Island" on which site 41HR405 was recorded is wholly
composed of dredge material deposited on the original low,
marshy left bank of the San Jacinto River, which subsequently subsided beneath the water surface. Furthermore,
the name attached to this madeland island was originally
used for a separate landform that had previously subsided
and/or eroded. Goat Island (or St. Mary's Island) continues
to be a platform for dredge disposal and is actively eroding.
The TARL survey team was unable to locate any prehistoric cultural material on the island during a 100 percent
pedestrian survey and examination of existing cutbank profiles. The findings were entirely consistent with the information derived from aerial photographs and historic maps documenting the origin of the "new" Goat Island. The locality
may never have been an intact archeological site. Archeological materials recovered during the earlier investigations
were probably redeposited from a short distance away, probably within the Houston Ship Channel, during earlier dredging operations. No historic occupations or use of the immediate site area is known (and is highly unlikely given its
original marshy character). Therefore, site 41HR405 has little
or no research potential, does not satisfy eligibility criteria
for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places,
and no additional work or investigation is recommended.
41HRS77 (NORTHWESTORLEFf BANK
OF BUFFALO BAYOU)
Site 41HR577 was recorded in 1986 on the left (northwest) bank of Buffalo Bayou during a survey for the Coastal
Water Authority's (CWA) Northwest Lateral Pipeline
(Heartfield, Price and Green, Inc. 1986). It was reported to be
a dense shell lens or "midden" roughly 20 to 30 cm thick and
extending about 25 m along the bankline (and covered by
more than 3 m of dredge spoil) that was actively eroding
from the base of that bank, at or just above the water line. A
single heavily eroded prehistoric sherd and one fragmented
turtle bone were found on the beach in front of the shell
deposit and were felt to have been recently eroded out from
it.
This shell lens was re-located by TARL in 1997, but it
appeared to be about half as long (ca. 15 m) as reported in
1986, suggesting continued erosion of the Buffalo Bayou
margin. Pedestrian survey, cutbank examination, auger
probes, and two shovel tests were conducted during the
course of the TARL investigations. Prehistoric sherds were
recovered from within this shell lens, but continued excavation revealed that the "midden" also contained historic and
modern artifacts and was underlain by additional dredge
spoil and sand. Further probing on the beach failed to reach
intact sediments. Evidence from aerial photos and topographic maps indicate that this was originally a low relief
area subjected to considerable local subsidence. It has also
been blanketed by thick deposits of dredged sediment from
the Houston Ship Channel and Carpenters Bayou.

141

Based on this new information, the site is no longer
considered an intact prehistoric site but rather redeposited
shell (perhaps cultural) with a mix of modern, historic, and
prehistoric artifacts and materials such as wood. Testing
well below the water line suggests that no intact sediments
are now within 2 m of the modern beach surface. The immediate site area has been subjected to considerable subsidence in the past and continues to be impacted by erosion
from shipwakes and occasional storms and flood events.
The research potential of 41HR577 is very low. The prehistoric artifacts recovered in this deposit are thoroughly mixed
with historic material and occur in low frequencies and are in
poor condition. It is not eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, and no further investigations are recommended.
SOUTHEAST(RIGHT)BANKOFBUFFALOBAYOU
1his section contains National Register of Historic Places
eligibility assessments and recommendations for five sites
investigated by TARL during the course of this project. The
firstfourofthese(41HR33,41HR104,41HR105,and41HR121)
were originally recorded and defined by Neyland in the late
1950s. They were all prehistoric shell middens along the
1956-era bankine. Neyland conducted extensive collections
and excavations at 41HR33, resulting in a very large artifact
collection and documentary records now curated at TARL.
The artifacts include 40 partially reconstructed aboriginal
ceramic vessels which were the focus of TARL assessment
and preliminary analyses. TARL was unable to locate any of
the original bankline midden sites, although a small remnant
portion of one site (41HR121) was discovered on the valley
slope and extensively tested. Finally, a fifth site (41HR576)
was explored and partially tested by TARL, as part of the
investigations 41HR121.
The historic site 41HR576 is presented first, followed
by summaries and significance assessments of each of the
prehistoric sites. Specific recommendations for additional
fieldwork investigations at 41HR121 are considered, along
with proposed archival and documentary research of
41HR576. Finally, the utility and feasibility of conducting
research using curated ceramic vessel collections is contemplated.
IIlSTORICSITE41HRS76
Site 41HR576 is a large, multicomponent historic site
occupying all or most of the property now owned by the
CWA, and it may extend into the adjacent Houston Light
and Power and Paktank, Inc. properties as well. The CWA
and Houston Light & Power properties, as well as the San
Jacinto Battleground State Park itself, are relatively undisturbed, especially in light of the extensive industrial and
commercial development characterizing the project area as
a whole. Historic surfaces are apparently intact and acces-

142

sible, particularly northeast of the 108-inch water line, although some portions are mantled by redeposited Beaumont Formation clays. In addition to the two historic components or occupations previously identified%San Jacinto
Day picnicking and dumping by the San Jacinto Inn
(Heartfield, Price and Greene 1986)%several others can be
demonstrated or are likely, including (1) activities related
to the Lynchburg-Harrisburg Road which passed through
the property, (2) possible remains of a late-nineteenth or
early-twentieth-century industrial or manufacturing facility, (3) the potential use of the area by refugees waiting to
cross the San Jacinto River during the Runaway Scrape,
and (4) camping of the Texan Army before and just after
the Battle of San Jacinto. The latter has previously been
suggested (cf. Heartfield, Price and Greene 1986) and is
supported by first-hand accounts of the Battle reviewed as
part of the current TARL investigations, particulary when
examined from a paleogeographical perspective. It is anticipated that the material remains of these various components will be unequally distributed across the upland and
valley margin and will partially overlap one another in a
patchwork or mosaic.
Information currently available is insufficient to conclusively determine the significance or research potential of
several 41HR576 components in terms of the various historic research contexts outlined in the Comprehensive Historic Preservaton Plan (Kibler et al. 1996). A~ditional documentary and archival information should be compiled and
carefully assessed. Then, if warranted, preliminary field investigations should be undertaken. In particular, deed, tax,
and other records should be carefully examined in order to
determine the origin and use of the concrete footings and
foundations found there. Furthermore, a more formal evaluation should be undertaken of the hypothesis that the
41HR576 area may have played an important role in the Battle
of San Jacinto and the Runaway Scrape; and where archeological remains related to those events are likely to be found.
Sources should include first-hand accounts of the Battle as
well as a compilation of all published and unpublished information on artifacts pertaining to these events and their locations (e.g., Duke 1974a, 1974b). These data should be evaluated from a paleogeographical perspective; that is, taking
into consideration the landscape and topography in 1836.
This effort should address the question of where the bayous, marshes, inundated lowlands, open plains, and likely
tree lines were located. Finally, documentary evidence relating to other historic occupations or land use at 41HR576
should also be compiled and evaluated in terms of the historic contexts.
If warranted by the documentary and archival review, a
program of additional field testing may be necessary. In particular, geophysical survey using magnetometers and perhaps ground penetrating radar with appropriate sensitivity
ranges could be employed to isolate particular historic com-

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

ponents and their extent. In the event that this work is undertaken, it must be with the recognition that the components being sought will probably be oflow visibility and low
artifact density. Also, if the above-ground structures are
found to be significant, they may need to be mapped and/or
further examined and described.
One component of 41HR576 that is well-known is the
use of the valley margin by the San Jacinto Inn as a trash
dump, beginning perhaps as early as 1927. Most, ifnot all, of
the artifacts recovered during the testing of prehistoric site
41HR121in1997-1998 by TARL can be attributed to this
dumping activity. The portion of 41HR576 that partially overlies the prehistoric deposits of 41HR121 is not considered
significant and, regardless, covers a much larger area to the
northeast. No further field investigations related to this specific component of 41HR576 are recommended. Mechanical
stripping to expose the more deeply buried prehistoric components should be permitted since the potential loss of archeological information is minimal.

PREHISTORIC SITES 41HR33, 41HR104,
AND41HR105
No evidence of intact Buffalo Bayou alluvium or any
trace of bankline shell midden sites 41HR33, 41HR104,
41HR105, or 41HR121 (as originally defined) were found
during the TARL survey. Along the entire beach and
bankline, these sites have either been completely eroded or
have now subsided well beneath the water line. However,
some portion of the original terrace and archeological sediments probably still exists within the current channel of Buffalo Bayou, buried by a deep mantle of sand and water, although they must have been impacted to an unknown degree by erosion prior to submergence. Unfortunately, they
are unlikely to yield sufficient useful data to justify the great
expense and effort of excavation. No additional work on
these sites is recommended.
A careful reading ofNeyland's notes demonstrates that
41HR105, as originally defined, is clearly not within the
boundaries of the San Jacinto Battleground (41HR277, a State
Archeological Landmark and National Register of Historic
Places listed site). However, TARL testing suggests that a
small area of equivalent sediment may be preserved behind
the bulkhead within the current park. These sediments are
deeply buried at or just below the water line. No adverse
impact within this area of park is anticipated due to planned
navigational improvements to the Houston Ship Channel,
and no further work is recommended at this time. The assertion that 41HR105 represents a historic trash deposit (see
Kibler et al. 1996: 163) is apparently unsupported. The listing
of 41HR105 as a State Archeological Landmark and an National Register of Historic Places site, presumably by extension from its purported association with the battleground
(41HR277), is similarly misleading.

Chapter 8: Conclusions and Recommendations

PREIDSTORIC SITE41HR121
Unlike the other three prehistoric sites defined by
Neyland along the southeast bank of Buffalo Bayou, a remnant of site 41HR121 was relocated and tested. It is an upslope
extension of the original bankline midden site and is composed of thin, sheetlike deposits of Rangia and some oyster
shell. Associated ceramic and lithic artifacts suggest the
site dates to the Clear Lake period, the earliest ceramic period in the Galveston Bay area (Aten 1983a). The depth and
extent of the site have been accurately determined, and there
is no evidence of significant downslope displacement of the
artifacts or shell. It appears to represent no more than a few
individual occupations. However, in light of its size and limited artifact content, the question of significance and research potential warrants exploration.
The information potential of smaller sites is in many
ways greater than that of larger sites. Larger sites typically
accumulate over a long period of time as a result of repeated
occupations, which ultimately leads to a palimpsest in which
discrete occupation events are later difficult if not impossible to discern (Binford 1982; Perring 1986). While such
situations can be desirable for tracking cultural and stylistic
changes through time, the structural, behavioral, and depositional facies of individual events are often hopelessly overprinted. The potential of sites representing just one or a few
occupations lies in the possibility of recognizing individual
events and determining the range of activities, season of the
event, and spatial patterning of human behaviors during a
brief interval of time. Clearly, such information is crucial for
fully understanding prehistoric adaptations. Unfortunately,
small sites are often difficult to recognize and locate. Moreover, their modest appearance and low artifact density are
not traditional catalysts of sustained archeological inquiry.
Notable exceptions of small-site research in the Galveston
Bay area include Aten's (1983b) research on the Trinity
Delta, Weinstein's (1991) excavations at Lido Harbor, and
Gadus and Howard's ( 1990) investigations at the Redtail site
(41HR581) adjacentto Peggy Lake.
Indeed, TARL's discovery of the Rangia shell lens at
41HR121 was fortuitous. There are no surface indications of
the site and very little visible along the heavily vegetated
cutbank. If not for the erosion of a small portion of the site
along its northern edge, apparently during a period of extraordinary flooding, it is unlikely the site would have been
found. Even by small site standards, 41HR121 is thin. In
many places, the shell lens is only a single shell thick, and
nowhere does it exceed ca. 5 cm. In contrast, shell deposits
at the Redtail site (41 HR581) were as much as 12 cm or more
thick (Gadus and Howard 1990:Figure 35).
Site 41 HR121 satisfies significance criteria for small sites
outlined in the recent Comprehensive Historic Preservation
Plan for the project area (Kibler et al. 1996:53-54). Specifically, the plan recommends that:
Thin, small shell middens lacking topography

143

should have witnessed a minimal amount of disturbance and have subsurface contexts. Components
should be clearly discrete, and preferably ... should
represent a single-component site with an ample
amount of temporally diagnostic cultural materials
to define a specific temporal-cultural period[s].
... [Such] single-component sites potentially represent the most significant sites.
Furthermore, the 41HR121 components may aid in further refinement of the absolute chronology of the Clear Lake
period and the initial appearance of ceramics in the Galveston
Bay area, also identified as significant research priorities
(Kibler et al. 1996:55). Site 41HR121 satisfies all these requirements and has been shown to have sufficient and significant research potential. Therefore, the site is eligible under Criterion D of Section 106 for nomination to the National
Register of Historic Places. The lower portion of the site is
currently subject to shipping-related erosion during periods
of unusually high water, such as floods and storm surges.
Furthermore, given that41HR121 is within the zone oflikely
adverse impact from planned navigational improvements to
the Houston-Galveston Navigational Channel (or Houston
Ship Channel), additional research is recommended to mitigate this ongoing (and potential) adverse impact if that impact cannot be eliminated through construction
modification(s).

Recommendations for Mitigation
Any strategy for mitigative excavations at 41HR121
should be designed to take advantage of the unique situation and preservation conditions of the site (a single or limited number of discrete components over a relatively short
period of time) and its potential to yield detailed intrasite
patterning. The discrete nature of the site requires a focus
on horizontal (or lateral) relationships rather than vertical (or
stratigraphic) ones. In other words, because the site is apparently so thin and isolated, the focus should be primarily
on maintaining and recording horizontal provenience information. However, given the clayey nature of the surrounding matrix, it is difficult to expose and precisely point plot
artifacts prior to their removal (this applies especially to shell
and small stone objects). In addition, such a strategy is prohibitively costly in terms of field time and effort. As an alternative, the smallest practical grid size can instead be selected and used as the minimal provenience unit. However,
balancing this approach with documentation is often difficult (i.e., the time saved point plotting is spent taking extra,
and often redundant, fieldnotes). A smaller grid is also less
practical for deeper excavations. Spatial resolution is the
critical factor in deciphering small sites. For example, the
separation ofindividual components at the Redtail (41HR581)
site was hindered by the 1-m grid system (Gadus and Howard
1990: 171). Although a large area was exposed, the grid sys-

144

tern proved to be a signifiant limitation to analysis.
The advanced testing by TARL at 41HR121 served to
both isolate the shell lens stratigraphically as well as to test
specific field and laboratory procedures that might be used
during mitigation. Devising a workable small-grid system
was a primary objective. Subdividing a standard 1-x-1-m
square in either 16 individual 25-x-25-crn quadrats or four 50x-50-cm quadrants while maintaining the 1 m 2 as the basic
unit of recordation, resolves this problem. Furthermore, the
system used during the 41HR121 testing allows sufficient
flexibility to record specific information by the smaller grid
units if necessary as well as a means of tying that to the
"master" record of the l-x-1-m unit as a whole. Although
both systems were used during TARL testing in spring 1998,
the 25-x-25-cm unit appears to be preferable to the 50-x-50cm grid. The former provides four times the analytical resolution and, based on experience using both during the 1998
testing of 4IHR121, takes at most 20 percent more field time
than does the latter. This is primarily due to additional time
writing waterproof tags that accompany the sediment to the
screens and laboratory. The smaller volume of the 25-cm
grid also allows for a more-thorough and rapid field soaking
and screening. It also reduces to a much more convenient
size for final laboratory soaking, screening, and picking. Final laboratory processing and analysis time should not be
greatly affected: the same total numbers of objects will be
processed and analyzed, only in smaller subsets. Finally, the
25-cm grid permits the recognition and isolation of smaller,
more ephemeral subfeatures than would be possible using
the 50-cm grid.
The size of the hearth/midden couplets excavated at
41CH31,41CH170,and41HR85,AreaA(Aten 1983b)canbe
used as guides for selecting an optimal grid size. The hearth
at 41CHI70 was ca. 40 cm in diameter, and the total area of
the couplet of which it is a part is only a little over 3 m 2 (Aten
1983b: 12-13). At the Harris County Boys School (4 IHR85),
Area A consisted of several discrete occupational episodes
(similar to 4 lHRl 21) of which only one oyster shell lens was
excavated (Aten 1983b:72-73). The entire occupational unitshell and associated hearth-covered an area of about 6.5
m2 â¢ The roughly oval-shaped hearth (Aten 1983b:Figure 23)
measured approximately 30-x-40cm. Two hearth/midden couplets excavated at 41 CH31 were slightly larger, reaching a
maximum of ca. 10 m2 , but the hearths did not exceed 75 cm in
diameter. A 50-cm grid would be inadequate to meaningfully
subdivide such deposits for analysis. The spatial contrasts
defining small features or activity areas could easily be lost
in large grid units. On the other hand, a 25-cm grid could
contour the density of burned shell, lithics, bone fragments,
and ceramics to reconstruct the fine-grained structural evidence of human behavior(s) during a relatively short period
of time that is the object of study. However, should the 25cm unit system prove too cumbersome or costly during the
mitigation, a staged research design would allow for
reevalation and, if necessary, a switch to the larger 50-cm

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

grid size in order to meet project goals and deadlines within
the existing budget. If this occurs, data gathered in the 25cm system could be easily converted to the 50-cm format for
comparative purposes. An important feature of the excavation system advocated here is its flexibility. The excavators
can switch back and forth as necessary.
It is recommended that sediments overlying the prehistoric shell lens be removed mechanically to within about 10
cm of the shell lens. Historic materials from the immediate
41HRI21 area are limited primarily to San Jacinto Inn dumping activities in the mid-twentieth century and are unlikely
to contain artifacts or features related to significant nineteenth-century or Texas Revolution-era occupations. However, archeologists should closely monitor the mechanical
stripping of 41HR121 and, if such earlier materials are encountered, the mechanical removal could shift to hand excavation in that immediate area if deemed necessary upon consultation with COE archeologists and the THC. It is also
recommended that a limited amount of mechanical stripping
be done in areas adjacent to the site (e.g., on the upland).
This may expose ephemeral occupations or activity areas
that were not recognized during testing. Weinstein's (1991)
suggestion of stripping sediment in "swaths" to assist in
locating and isolating low-density and low-visibility archeological features is seconded.
Sediment should be carefully removed to within 5-10 cm
of shell deposits although the effort may be necessarily more
conservative in areas without shell. After stripping, the 1-m
grid system should be laid out using a TDS while at the same
time obtaining detailed elevational data. Within each 1-m
unit, subunits can then be quickly laid out using an overlay
grid. The remaining overlying sediment can then be removed
as a single level, exposing as much of the shell lens and
artifacts lying directly on it as is possible. The shell lens can
then be removed as a second level, attempting, insofar as
possible, to isolate the shell lens itself. Finally, a third level,
immediately beneath the shell can remove any remaining
dark Holocene (IA) sediment. Excavations need not intrude
into the underlying sterile Beaumont Formation clays except
in a few instances (to confirm thatall of the overlying material has been removed). It is anticipated that this final level
will rarely, if ever, exceed 10 cm. Field experience using this
system suggests that excavation in smaller provenience units
(i.e., 25-x-25-cm squares) allows for greater control and effective isolation of the shell lens. Again, the effectiveness
of this strategy should be evaluated throughout the course
of the fieldwork.
Sediment should be screened in the same 1/4-inch over
118-inch nested setup described in the testing section. The
procedure of reducing field screening time by focusing on
reducing bulk and deferring final soaking and screening for
the laboratory also appear to be highly effective in terms of
time, costs, and recovery efficiency. Special analyses should
be limited to selected micromorphological sampling and perhaps additional pollen sampling in and below the shell lens.

Chapter 8: Conclusions and Recommendations

Flotation and macrobotanical analysis of selected subareas
and features should also be attempted to identify intrasite
variability (i.e., from better known and larger exposures than
were available during TARL testing). Analysis of
microvertebrates, ostracodes, phytoliths, and diatoms are
unlikely to yield meaningful data and are therefore not recommended. Fine screening (1116-inchmesh) of floated sediment for microdebitage and possible otoliths should be continued. The low cost and umequited potential of magnetic
susceptibility suggests that it might continue to be used in
an attempt to identify ephemeral hearths and burned areas,
despite the disappointing initial results. It is likely that the
sensitivity of the instrumentation used in this study was
insufficient to differentiate between background values and
any magnetically enhanced areas of burning. Further, it is
entirely possible that no burned areas were in fact encountered in the relatively small area tested. If more sensitive
instrumentation can be located, it is possible that magnetically enhanced areas may be identified in a larger horizontal
exposure. However, the cost of undertaking such an effort,
in terms of both time and money, should be carefully considered during the planning stages of any future excavation.
The preceding considerations should be integrated into
a more-detailed research methodology developed prior to
fieldwork to maximize the data potential of 41HRI21 for addressing small sites on the Upper Texas Coast and elsewhere (cf. Weinstein 1991). This might include such things
as group size, mimimum depositional units (e.g., the hearth/
midden couplet), seasonality, behavior and site structure
(e.g., activity areas), dietary information (e.g., relative abundance of Rangia or oyster as opposed to vertebrate remains),
the isolation of small features (such as hearths), and chronometric issues in the project area (see Kibler et al. 1996).
Other interrelated issues of the prehistoric adaptive system
in the Upper Texas Coast region (as outlined in Gadus and
Howard 1990:39) might include paleoenvironments, chronology, settlement and subsistence systems, technology,
population dynamics, and intraregional and extraregional
interactions. Whatever specific research design is eventually adopted it should include sufficient flexibility to meet
project objectives as well as include built-in criteria by which
to evaluate and monitor the progress of the research even as
fieldwork continues.
RECOMMENDEDANALYSISOFTHENEYLAND
COLLECTIONANDOTHERCURAlEDMATERIALS
The extensive notes, photographs, maps, and artifacts
in the Neyland Collection housed at TARL are primaryand in many cases the only-sources of data on literally
dozens of sites in the project area that have since been entirely lost to erosion, subsidence, and development. Elucidation of this fact in the context of this project, specifically
as seen in the ceramic research into site 41HR33, shows the
value of studying the Neyland Collection materials that per-

145

tain to the project area, especially for sites that no longer
exist or are no longer accessible.
Neyland was dedicated and tireless in his archeological
pursuits in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The notebooks,
correspondence, and maps he generated during this time fill
two large file boxes. In addition, Neyland took literally hundreds of photographs of prehistoric sites in and around the
project area. Artifacts, sediment samples, faunal remains,
and even plaster casts of projectile points were collected
and, for the most part, are provenienced to some degree.
Neyland's interest and activities were not confined solely to
the project area. While the quality of the note-taking and
methods do not conform to present professional standards,
this does not prohibit valuable inquiry or use of the collections. And Neyland was not alone. Others, such as R.
Worthington, W. T. Atwood, R. Ring, and A. Duke, among
others, also conducted some degree of archeological research
in the project area prior to the influx of professional archeologists and projects beginning in the late 1960s. At a time
when the archeological record along the entire length of the
Houston Ship Channel was being lost on a massive scale,
Neyland and the others committed to salvaging as much as
they could before time, tides, and tankers exacted their irretrievable toll,
The notes and ceramic collections from 41HR33 are an
excellent example. Rapid and thorough destruction of the
entire terrace along the southeast bank of Buffalo Bayou in
the project area has already been discussed at length. During this time, Neyland managed to (1) collect or excavate
over 2,400 sherds, nearly all of which are labeled with some
provenience information, (2) fill almost four notebooks with
descriptions and interpretations (see Appendix N), (3) generate a number of maps, and finally (4) take perhaps 200
black-and-white and color photographs. The notes and photographs have been used to carefully piece together as much
information as possible on the stratigraphy and
paleogeomorphology of 41HR33 and the adjacent sites.
Of the almost 2,550 individual sherds in the 41HR33
collection, 1,076 have been refitted or otherwise grouped
into 40 partially reconstructed vessel sets or batches (ranging from 1 to 205 individual sherds each). Of the 40 vessels,
27 were originally recognized and refitted by Neyland. The
other 13 were found during TARL's preliminary inventory
and assessment of the loose sherd collection. It is likely
that additional refits to existing vessel batches, or perhaps
new vessels, reside in the remaining loose sherds. A wide
variety of vessel types and sizes are represented, but the
overwhelming majority are undecorated Goose Creek wares.
A few examples of O'Neal Plain var. Conway, Mandeville,
Tchefuncte, and Goose Creek var. Anahuac were found
suggesting that the 41HR33 deposits may be closely related to the upslope extension of 41HR121 investigated by
TARL. Neyland's description and documentation of the
41HR33 deposits, as well as the provenience of refitted
sherds and the recovery of grog-tempered vessels above

146

the main shell deposit, indicate that 41HR33 was intact.
In addition to the ceramics, the 41HR33 collection includes arrow and dart points, lithic tools and debitage, a
wide range of bone tools, faunal remains, sediment samples,
isolated charcoal and seed fragments (many of which are
charred), ground stones, ocher, asphaltum, and samples of
Rangia shell. Notes and records pertaining to other sites
investigated by Neyland suggest a similar range of materials, although apparently not approaching the scale of the
41HR33 collection.
Another remarkable aspect of the 41HR33 ceramic collection is the unusual amount of repairing and mending of
the ceramics in the form of numerous mending holes on both
sherds and vessels. In one case, a clay patch was used to
repair a crack. Preliminary analysis and measurements of
vessel batches have been completed in conjunction with
the TARL analysis (Hood 1998). While this study did not
result in definitive conclusions regarding the 41HR33 materials, it along with others such as Ellis's (1992) technological
systems approach demonstrates the vitality and potential of
ceramic studies, especially among mobile hunters and gatherers such as the aboriginal peoples of the Upper Texas
Coast.
Investigation of ceramic technology, utilization, distribution, variability, and the like was not specifically included
in the recommended research contexts outlined in the historic preservation plan (Kibler et al. 1996). However, technology and the related domains of settlement and subsistence systems, chronology, and intraregional and
extraregional interactions have been presented and discussed (e.g., Gadus and Howard 1990). In light of such considerations, it is important to maximize the information potential of existing data, such as curated and privately held
vessel collections. The goal of identifying relevant variables
and developing appropriate research contexts for eventual
application to sherd collections must begin with basic information on form, size, function, manufacturing, materials, and
distribution and the relationships between them which are
best derived from the study of whole or partially reconstructed vessels. Such studies may not only advance our
understanding of the prehistory of the Upper Texas Coast,
but could potentially contribute in a larger disciplinary context as well. Emphasis should be on using and maximizing
the best data at hand, for making reliable observations and
inferences, and eventually generating testable hypotheses.
Studies such as those of Hood (1998) and Ellis (1992) clearly
benefit from the inclusion of whole or partially reconstructed
vessels and significant vessel sections.
A valuable regional database already exists and is ripe
for comprehensive study. For example, 68 vessel sections
and batches from sites near Peggy Lake (collected by
Worthington and analyzed by Howard) is available (Gadus
and Howard 1990). In addition, an informal exploration of

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

the literature and TARL holdings from sites in and around
the project area, suggests that literally dozens of partial
vessels are readily available. Collections from sites on Cedar Bayou (Ambler 1967), Lido Harbor (Weinstein 1991),
Mitchell Ridge (Ricklis 1994), and a host of sites in the
Wallisvilleffrinity River Delta, along with other sites (such
as 41HR31) in the Neyland Collection are sources of additional data. Presumably there is also a tremendous amount
of material in private, undocumented collections, some of
which may be accessed with the assistance of avocational
groups such as the Houston Archeological Society. It is
appropriate to begin this regional effort with a thorough
study of the ceramics in the Neyland Collection and elsewhere that come from now-destroyed or inaccessible sites
along the ship channel.
CONCLUSIONS

Ten known archeological sites were surveyed, evaluated, and/or tested by TARL between the summer of 1997
and the spring of 1998. Five sites (41HR405, 41HR577,
41HR680, 41HR681, and 41HR685) were determined to be
eroded, subsided, or natural accumulations of redeposited
cultural material that had been erroneously recorded as intact sites. None of these sites is eligible for National Register of Historic Places listing, and no further work is recommended. A group of four sites along the southeastern bank
of Buffalo Bayou, originally recorded in the 1950s by Wayne
Neyland, was also surveyed (41HR33, 41HR104, 41HR105,
and 41HR121). No intact portions of those sites were found
above the water line or within the impact zone of planned
channel improvements. However, a small upslope extension
of one of them (41HR121) was discovered. Testing revealed
it to be a thin, intact shell lens with significant research
potential. It is eligible for listing on the National Register of
Historic Places. A program of intensive testing was conducted to refine our understanding of the site and to develop the most effective research methodology possible.
Additional excavation at this site is recommended. In addition, a complex, multicomponent historic locality (41 HR576)
was found and partially assessed. Additional archival and
documentary investigations are recommended to determine
if fieldwork is warranted. Its National Register of Historic
Places significance remains unresolved. Finally, it is recommended that a comprehensive study be made of the ceramic
data in extant collections from now-destroyed sites along
the ship channel. The aggregate results from previously investigated sites, the proposed work at 41HR121, and the
existing collections will contribute significant data to the
regional prehistoric record. All indications are that few, if
any, other intact prehistoric sites exist within this project
area, so there is not likely to be much data added in the
future.

APPENDIX C: LITHIC ANALYSIS
by Russell K. Brownlow and Paul R. Takac

Page intentionally left blank.

Appendix C: Lithic Analysis

This appendix details the lithic materials from sites
41HR121 and 41HR33. The former were collected during
TARL investigations in 1997 and 1998, while the latter collection was made in the 1950s when the four sites along the
southeastern (right) bank of Buffalo Bayou (41HR33,
41HR104, 41HR105, and41HR121) were first defined and
sampled by Wayne B. Neyland of the Houston Archeological Society. The justification for presenting the lithic analysis from both sites together is that 41HR121 is believed to be
an upslope extension of the complex of lower terrace-level
sites, including 41HR33. All four of the original site localities
recorded in the 1950s have now been completely eroded by
ship-generated wave action in Buffalo Bayou or have subsided beneath the current water line.
The lithic materials from 41HR121, recovered during
TARL survey efforts in 1997 and additional testing in the
spring of 1998, consist of 210 chipped stones (3 projectile
points and point fragments, 1 biface, 170 pieces of debitage,
and 36 pieces of microdebitage,), 2 unmodified chert pebbles,
and 1 siltstone specimen. In addition, several collected
samples of naturally occurring materials (caliche and burned
clay) are reported at the end ofthis appendix. No prehistoric
artifacts from 41HR121 were collected by Neyland although
several historic items were (see Appendix F).
Site 41HR33 was originally discovered in March 1957
by Wayne B. Neyland of the Houston Archeological Society and over the next two years he made periodic visits to
the site to collect artifacts on the surface and/or eroding
from cutbank profiles as well as to conduct limited test excavations (see Chapter 7). Recovered lithic materials from
41HR33 include 86 chipped stones (10 projectile points and
point fragments, 1 biface, and 1 flake chopper, 3 chert cores,
and 71 pieces of debitage,) 1 unmodified chert cobble, and 1
siltstone abrader. Provenience information does not exist for
over 90 percent of the lithic debitage; therefore, provenience
is shown here for only the diagnostic projectile points and
identified lithic tools (Table 21).
Both 41HR33 and the TARL upslope extension of
41HR121 appear to be associated with the complex of overlapping sites defined by Neyland located in relative proximity to one another along the banks and floodplain terrace of
Buffalo Bayou. In addition, several prehistoric sites in the
nearby Peggy Lake Archeological District (Gadus and
Howard 1990) that have previously been examined in detail
are located approximately 2.5 to 3.0 km southeast of 41HR121
and 41HR33. Because of this, it was deemed necessary to
utilize comparable analytical categories when examining the
materials from these various sites in order to develop a coherent synthesis of the cultural adaptations represented by
this complex of sites. To facilitate this, the lithic analysis
presented here utilizes the analytical categories presented
by Gadus and Howard (1990) in which lithic materials from
the Peggy Lake sites were reported.
The bulk of the Peggy Lake data came from excavations
at two very different sites: 41HR124 and 41HR581. Site

185

41HR124 is a thick, extensive shell midden with multiple components spanning about 3,400 years, from ca. 1700 B.c. to
A.D. 1650, while 41HR581 is a much smaller, thinner shell
midden comprised of what appear to be discrete occupational deposits, most of which occurred between A.D. 400
and A.D. 700 (Gadus et al. 1990:201 ). In a similar way, the two
sites reported herein represent very different site types.
Ney land's records clearly show that site 41HR33 was a relatively thick (30 to 50+ cm in most places) midden composed
of multiple coalesced and interbedded shell lenses (see Chapter 7). In contrast, the upslope extension of 41HR121 investigated by TARL is a very thin (less than 5 cm thick) shell
midden deposit that represents a single (or limited number
of) prehistoric occupation(s). Comparisons between and
among the smaller (41HR121 and 41HR581) and larger
(41HR33 and 41HR124) sites may reveal much about the
prehistoric occupations and occupants at these neighboring sites.
RAW MATERIALS

Gadus (1990:269) notes the absence of local lithic resources in the immediate area of Peggy Lake and of Galveston
Bay area in general. Possible regional sources for the raw
material utilized by the inhabitants of the area may have
been the gravels of the upper San Jacinto and Trinity Rivers
located to the north or the Colorado and Brazos Rivers to
the west (Fisher 1965:58). The origin of these gravels is ultimately the Willis Formation which parallels the coast 80 to
140 km to the north of the Gulf of Mexico (Aten 1983:342;
Garner 1967:3). The Willis Formation gravels are generally
yellow, red, and brown pebbles of chert, quartzite, and silicified wood ranging up to 64 mm in size (Garner 1967:3). In
addition, some gravels from the Colorado and Brazos Rivers
may originate from sources farther inland such as the
Edwards Plateau. Hall ( 1981 :24) notes that good-quality
cherts and quartzites can be found in extensive gravel bars
along the lower Brazos.
The use of gastroliths as an on-site local source of raw
material has also been postulated by Aten (1983:342-346).
Both birds and alligators have gastroliths, which aid in digestion by internally crushing or grinding ingested food.
Aten suggests that the capture of these animals as food
resources could have introduced pebbles ranging from 7 to
35 mm in size. Smaller pebbles found on coastal sites may be
those ingested by birds, while larger pebbles carried by alligators may have been suitable for use in the production of
stone tools. Aten (1983:345) presents three points to his
gastrolith argument. He first notes that there seems to be no
other agent that could have introduced smaller pebbles to
the sites. He states that the likelihood of humans bringing
the pebbles to the sites is low since they have little chipping
value. In addition, the modern sediment load for the coastal
streams does not include these pebbles and probably did
not in the past. His second point is that the sizes of many of

the chipped stone tools from the Galveston Bay sites fit
within the size range of modern alligator gastroliths. Finally,
Aten feels that his gastrolith theory accounts for the high
polish that appears on some pebbles from coastal sites.
Although gastroliths may indeed be a source of raw
material utilized by the aborigines of the Galveston Bay area,
Gadus ( 1990:270) points out that the ultimate source of the
gastroliths had to be the Willis Formation pebbles. She emphasizes instead the importance of distinguishing between
local or regionally available material and extraregional material in order to understand trade and group interaction. In
addition, this distinction may also aid in understanding the
movements of the area's inhabitants, assuming that lithic
materials were at times obtained first-hand from their sources
rather than through trade or group interaction. Gadus
(1990:270) notes that most of the colors seen in the finegrained cherts in the Peggy Lake collection (tools and
debitage) are known to occur in the Willis Formation gravels. This appears to be the case with the materials in the
current analysis as well. Gadus also notes that a few specimens comprised of cherts that are white to white with red
specks or gray to light gray may derive outside of the region. Although no artifacts of white/white with red specks
are present in either of the 41HR121 or 41 HR33 collections,
several gray artifacts (presumably Edwards chert) have been
noted.
CHIPPED STONES

A total of296 specimens comprises the six chipped stone
artifact categories for sites 41HRl21 and 41HR33-9 arrow
points, 3 dart points, 2 bifaces, 2 flake 'tools, 3 cores, and 277
pieces of debitage (including 36 pieces ofmicrodebitage).
The basic metric attributes recorded for all artifacts other
than projectile points include length, width, and maximum
thickness. Projectile points were classified according to existing typologies as defined by Sohm and Jelks ( 1962), Turner
and Hester (1985), and Aten (1967, 1983). In addition, morphological groups established by Gadus (1990) were also
utilized for cross-comparison with the Peggy Lake sites.
Metric attributes for projectile points include maximum length,
blade width, neck width, maximum stem width, stem length,
and maximum thickness. Neck width refers to the width of
the stem where it meets the blade. All specimens have contracting or parallel-sided stems. Therefore, the metric attribute
for base width was not utilized. Furthermore, all projectile
points are described with reference to their morphological
attributes, including material type, serration, blade beveJing,
base form, method of manufacture, and fracture type. Due to
the low number of projectile points, all quantitative and qualitative attributes are presented in the text. Recovery of all
chipped stone tools from both sites is presented in Table 22,
while provenience of chipped stone artifacts from 4lHR121
is shown on Tables 23 and 24.

187

Arrow Points .
Nine arrow points and arrow point fragments were recovered from 41HR121 (n=2)and41HR33 (n=7). Two arrow
points fall into what Aten (1983) has termed Class A-1 (see
Table 21 ). Another arrow point has been classified as a Perdiz
point. Two have been categorized as Alba points, and one
has been categorized as Gadus's (1990) Group II based on
morphological similarities. One complete specimen is unclassified, and the two remaining specimens are too fragmentary to confidently classify as a known type.

Aten's Class A-1
Turner and Hester ( 1985: 168) note that this arrow point
type is commonly misclassifed as the Catahoula type. Both
have recurved lateral blade edges that flare at the shoulders
to form distinctive, large, rounded or squared barbs but have
different stems. Catahoula stems are short, wide, and slightly
expanding whereas Aten's Class A-1 points have small
straight-sided or contracting stems. Gadus ( 1990:271) notes
that her Group I type from the Peggy Lake sites encompasses characteristics of Aten's arrow point classes Al, A2,
and A3, distinguishing them from the Catahoula type on the
grounds that they lack the fine workmanship, wide expanding stem, and recurved blade of the Catahoula type. Her
Group I classification was not used here, because the specimens from 41HR33 do possess the fine workmanship and
recurved blade of the Catahoula type. The only difference is
their lack of an expanding stem.
Two specimens of this type were recovered from
41HR33. The first (Figure 57a) is a near complete specimen
made from a deep red to black, coarse-grained chert. The
lateral edges are highly recurved and flare out to squared
barbs. They are also moderately serrated. One barb has been
partially snapped. This specimen has basal notches that
have produced a parallel-sided stem that is slightly convex.
Maximum length is 31.5 mm, neck width is 6.0 mm, stem length
is 4.9 mm, and maximum thickness is 3.3 mm. Blade width was
not measured due to the broken barb.
The second specimen (Figure 57b) has been broken
into three pieces (perhaps during recovery according to
Neyland's notes). This is a large, thin specimen knapped
from a red and black banded fine-grained chert. The serrated
blade edges flare outward to rounded barbs with one barb
approximate} y 1.5 times larger than the other. This specimen
has a short, contracting stem. It measures 49. 7 mm in overall
length. Its blade width is 29 .4 mm, neck width is 6.8 mm, and
stem length is 4.0 mm. Maximum thickness is 4.1 mm.
It should be noted that the raw materials from which these
two points were made are not represented in the recovered
debitage assemblage from 41HR33. In addition, the size of the
second specimen is relatively large when compared to the
observed raw material size and the average primary flake size.

It measures 17 .3 mm in overall length. Blade width is 13.8
mm. Neck width is 4.9 mm, and stem length is 3.1 mm. Maximum thickness is 3.0mm.
The second (Figure 57e) is a relatively thick, reworked
specimen made from reddish brown, medium-grained chert.
This point can best be described as "stubby" as the blade
has been heavily reworked. The upper extent of the blade is
convex. Where the blade transitions to the barb, it is again
convex, but flares outward and down. The opposite barb
has been reworked to a nub. The slightly convex base is
parallel sided. This point measures 15.2 mm in overall length.
Blade edge is 12.7 mm. Neck width is 6.7 mm, and stem length
is 4.3 mm. Maximum thickness is 4.4 mm.

Gadus 's Group II
Gadus (1990:273) describes this type as generally having a triangular blade with straight to slightly concave serrated edges. The shoulders project at right angles or slightly
downward to a contracting stem. She notes that this group
is similar to Aten's Class A-4 and A-5 arrow points.
One specimen (Figure 57f) recovered from 41HR33 (originally classified as an Alba point by Neyland in 1957) has
been classified as this type. This point is thick and somewhat crudely manufactured. This may be due to the fact that
it was made from silicified wood. It has slightly serrated,
concave blade edges with short, downward projecting barbs.
The convex stem is contracting. It is missing the extreme
distal portion of the tip. This point measures 24.1 mm in
overall length. Blade width is 13.5 mm. Neck width is 5. 7 mm,
and stem length is 5.5 mm. Maximum thickness is 5.1 mm.

It is also at or beyond the upper size limit of measured bird and
alligator gastroliths (Aten 1983:Table B.1 ). These two points
probably represent extraregional interaction, possibly to the
north where the Catahoula type is prominent.

Perdiz
Turner and Hester (1985: 187) describe the Perdiz point
as being a triangular point with a well-barbed shoulder and a
contracting stem. They note the wide range of variability of Â·
this type across Texas.
The one specimen (Figure 57c) recovered from 41HR33 is
made from a yellow/brown chert that has been thermally altered to a red hue on the distal half of the point. This small
point has slightly convex blade edges that are slightly serrated and end in small barbs. It appears to have been reworked along the base as is evidenced by its stubby contracting stem and one reworked barb. By way of comparison, this
point looks more like the Bassett type of Northeast Texas
(Turner and Hester 1985:164). Its overall length is 21.2 mm.
Blade width is 12.8 mm.Neck width is 3.2mm, and stem length
is only 1.6 mm. This point's maximum thickness is 3.6 mm.

Alba
Alba points are defined by Turner and Hester ( 1985: 163)
as triangular points with concave or recurved, often-serrated lateral edges and wide, barbed shoulders. The stem of
the Alba type is parallel or slightly expanding. Two specimens of this type were recovered from 41HR33.
The first (Figure 57d) is a small point made from red,
fine-grained chert. Its serrated blade edges are relatively
straight, ending in barbed shoulders. One blade edge appears to have been reworked and lacks bifacial flaking along
one small segment. The slightly convex base is parallel sided.

Unclassified Point
One possible arrow or small dart point (Figure 57g) recovered from Level 5 of Unit Nl43/E99 at 41HR121 was not
classified as any known type. This specimen appears to be a
reworked dart point knapped from brownish gray chert. It
has convex blade edges that end in one squared shoulder.
The opposite shoulder is somewhat rounded. The stem is
contracting and ends in a straight base. It measures 32.6 mm
in overall length. Blade width is 18.2 mm. Neck width is 9.1
mm, and stem length is 8.3 mm. Maximum thickness is 7.0
nm.
The original flake scars on both faces of this specimen
acquired a yellow/brown patina. The point was then reworked
along the edges, leaving patinated flake scars along its dorsal ridge and portions of the ventral face. The new flaking
revealed the original gray-brown fine-grained chert beneath
the patina. This seems to indicate that the point was originally a larger dart point that was found much later in time by

similar patina development on the fresh flake scars. In overall shape, it seems to resemble an expedient Gary point.

Dart Points

Arrow Point Fragments

Two arrow point fragments were recovered that are too
fragmentary to confidently classify. The first (Figure 57h) is
most of an arrow point from 41HR33. It is made on a flake of
a light brown, fine-grained chert. The blade edges are slightly
concave and minimally serrated. The rounded barbs project
downward. The ventral face has only been worked along the
lateral edges. This point has not been classified because the
base has been snapped. What remains is a short (3.2 mm)
contracting stem. It may be an Alba or Perdiz point.
The second fragment (Figure 57i) was recovered from
Level 5 of Unit N139/E107 at 41HR121. This is the medial
fragment of a point made from a red, fine-grained chert. The

Three dart points or dart point fragments were recovered from 41HR121and41HR33. Two complete specimens
were collected at 41HR33 by Neyland in 1957 and one dart
point fragment was recovered from 41HRl21.
Gary

Turner and Hester (1985:101) define the Gary type as a
relatively crude and thick point with a wide range of variation. Diagnostic traits include a triangular body, indistinct,
squared shoulders, and a contracting stem. Both dart points
from 41HR33 have been classified as this type.
The first (Figure 58a) is a crudely fashioned specimen

an equal numberofflakes between 30 and 50 mm as 41HR121
and the Peggy Lake sites combined. Although the 41HR33
sample is definitely biased toward larger specimens, their
greater frequency may indicate the initial reduction of raw
material at this locale or a lack oflater-stage reduction at the
site. Meanwhile, the lower percentages of large specimens
at the other sites may reflect later-stage reduction. For example, the greaternumber of 0-10-mm flakes at site 4 lHRl 21
may indicate resharpening during use rather than the initial
manufacture oflithic implements. However, it is important to
remember the difference in screen sizes used in the two studies. The0-10-mmsamplefrom41HR124and41HR581 would
undoubtedly be larger if a 1/8-inch screen had been used. In
any case, 41HR33 has at least twice as many specimens
larger than 30 mm (n=8) as either 41HR124 (n=4) or 41 HR581
(n=3) (Gadus 1990:Table 67) and four times as many as

41HR121 (n=2). While sampling biases may account for the
differences between 41HR121 and 41HR33, the larger samples
from both 41HR124 and 41HR581 suggest that some real
variation in maximum flake size does occur at 41HR33.

Dorsal Cortex
Dorsal cortex was recorded for complete and proximal
flakes based on the percentage of cortex remaining on the
dorsal face. Primary flakes have 100 percent cortex coverage, while secondary flakes have less than 100 percent and
greater than 5 percent cortex coverage. Tertiary flakes have
0-5 percent cortex coverage. The secondary flakes were originally split into two categories (> 50 percent and < 50 percent), but the analysis of the Peggy Lake material failed to
show the utility of this distinction (Gadus 1990:283). There-

fore, like the Peggy Lake data, the two were lumped together.
Tertiary flake percentage at41HR121(ca.80 percent) is almost double that of 41HR33 (42 percent) and the bulk of the
debitage of Peggy Lake sites. Only the presumed exotic raw
material at Peggy Lake (white/white with red specks and
gray/light gray) had comparable percentages of tertiary flakes
(Gadus 1990:Table 70). Conversely, secondary flake percentages at 41HR33 and the Peggy Lake sites (41HR124 and
41HR581) are more than double the 41HR121 percentage.
Similarly, the primary flake percentages for 41HR33 and the
Peggy Lake sites are significantly higher than 4lHR121. This
also seems to support increased resharpening at 41HR121
(or at least late stage manufacture) when compared to the
other sites, despite the fact that a higher percentage of
debitage from the Buffalo Bayou sites appears to be of regionally available Willis Formation material (i.e., brown/yellow and red/light red). The apparent extraregional material at
Peggy Lake (white/white with red specks and gray/light gray)
shows similar percentages of tertiary flakes (Gadus 1990:Table
70).
Chip/Chunk Cortex
Cortex on chips and chunks was recorded as primary,
secondary, or tertiary (see Tables 23 and 24). The chips/
chunks with cortex are assumed to represent early stages in
a reduction sequence. Gadus (1990:285) notes that this attribute is useful in supporting the trends seen in the dorsal
cortex percentages. The vast majority of chips/chunks at
41HR121 lack cortex (78 percent), while the Peggy Lake sites
exhibit the opposite in the case of 41HR581 (28 percent) and
almost equal amounts of cortex (48 percent) and the lack
thereof (52 percent) at 41HR124 (Gadus 1990:Table 67). As
previously argued, the low percentage of chips/chunks with
cortex at 41HR121 presumably represents resharpening or
the later stages of reduction.
Platform Cortex
Platform cortex was recorded as present or absent for all
complete and proximal flakes with intact platforms. Like the
chip/chunk cortex, flakes removed late in the reduction sequence should exhibit little to no platform cortex (Tomka et
al. 1988:130). Only 64 percentoftheplatformsfrom41HR581
lacked cortex as opposed to 86 percent of those from 41 HR124
(Gadus 1990:Table 67). Nevertheless, the greatest percentage (94 percent) of platforms without cortex was found at.
41HR121. This again supports the previous arguments regarding late stage reduction at 41HR12 l.
Platform Facets
This attribute was recorded based on the number of
platform facets present on the flake. Platforms with two or
fewer facets were distinguished from platforms with three or

more facets. Crushed platforms were not included in this
category. According to Gadus (1990:286) and Magne
(1985: 122), the number of platform facets can be related to
the reduction stage with more facets indicative of a later
stage of reduction. The usefulness of this category is questionable for the 41HR121 sample. The debitage assemblage
clearly indicates later stage reduction, however 95 percent
of the flakes from 41HR121 fell into the "2 or fewer facets"
category. The Peggy Lake sites also exhibited high percentages in the same category, although both were below 80
percent. For this analysis, confidence in this category is
suspect.
Platform Grinding
The grinding of platforms serves to strengthen weak
platforms by removing thin and feathery edges in order to
prevent edge collapse during flake removal. This attribute
was recorded as present or absent for all intact platforms.
The Peggy Lake sites and 41HR121 all exhibited similar percentages of ground platforms with a range from 35 percent
to 39 percent.
Material Type
Material type was recorded for all recovered specimens.
The four material categories are fine-grained chert, coarsegrained chert, quartzite, and silicified wood. The most prolific material at all sites was fine-grained chert. All material
from 41HR33 was fine-grained chert. A small sample of silicified wood was recovered from 4 lHRl 21, yet the percentage
is low compared to the Peggy Lake sites. Similarly, so is the
percentage of coarse-grained chert. No quartzite was recovered from either41HR121 or41HR33.
Color
Color was recorded only for the fine-grained chert specimens. Like the Peggy Lake analysis, color determination was
based on the Munsell ranges of four basic color ranges: (1)
brown/yellow; (2) white/white with red specks; (3) gray/light
gray; and (4) red/light red. An additional indeterminate category was used for specimens that could not readily be
classified.
Gadus ( 1990:290) postulates that the brown/yellow and
red/light red colored materials are indicative of regionally
available Willis Formation gravel resources and that the
white/white with red specks and gray/light gray materials
represent extraregional raw material sources. Brown/yellow
chert is indeed the most common at all sites. As expected,
the second most common color at the Peggy Lake sites is
red/light red with gray/light gray being the third most common. However, gray/light gray is the second most common
color at 41HR121 and 41HR33, with red/light red only the
third most common color. In any case, the percentages of all

Appendix C: Lithic Analysis

three color varieties are rather low compared to the dominant brown/yellow category.

Utilization
Evidence of flake utilization, namely obvious edge attrition, was noted as either present or absent. Unlike the Peggy
Lake sites where 15-20 percent of all flakes were utilized,
41HR121 had only two utilized flakes (1 percent). Both had
some edge attrition from use. The difference in utilized flake
percentages between 41HR121 and the Peggy Lake sites is
likely due at least in part to the higher frequency of small
flakes (0-10mm)at41HR121.

Microdebitage
In addition to the lithic debitage collected from the 1/4inch and 1/8-inch screens, a small sample (N=36) of
microdebitage was collected from 1116-inch screens. These
microflakes were recovered during laboratory screening of
bulk matrix flotation samples from selected proveniences
from the 1998 TARL testing at 41HR121. Following the same
procedures used at Peggy Lake, the analysis of this material
consisted of recording the presence or absence of cortex
and material type for the entire sample. Color determination
was then made for the fine-grained chert portion of the
sample. Gadus (1990:288-289) felt that the microdebitage
sample from 41HR581 might provide supporting evidence
for the trends in lithic resource use and reduction stages
evident in the debitage sample from 1/4-inch screens used in
that study. Her microdebitage sample consisted of 2,309
flakes, whereas the sample from 41HR121 was comprised of
only 36 flakes. While much of this difference in sample size
is due to excavation intensity, the effect of screen size is also
important. In the Peggy Lake analysis all flakes less than 1/
4 inch are considered "microdebitage" while in the current
study only lithics smaller than 1/8 inch are included in that
category. Nonetheless, several patterns can be discerned in
these data.
All of the microdebitage from 41HR121 is decorticate (0
percent cortex) fine-grained chert. Brown/yellow fine-grained
chert makes up 64 percent of the sample, gray/light gray 22
percent, white/white with red specks 11 percent, and red/
light red comprises only 3 percent of the sample. The opposite appears to be the case with the material from 41HR581.
There the highest percentage of microdebitage is red/light
red (55 percent) and 35 percent of the sample has cortex.
Also as expected, nearly all of the apparently extraregional
materials (white/white with red flecks and gray/light gray)
lack cortex, consistent with late-stage lithic reduction. While
35 percent cortex is significant, it is lower than the 61 percent
average for the entire flake sample from 41HR581 (Gadus
1990:Table 67). It is unclear what percentage of the cortical
microflakes from this site are greater than 1/8 inch and would
therefore be included in the general debitage category in the

199

TARL analysis, further lowering the cortex percentage. The
small sample size of microdebitage from 41HRl21 precludes
statistically valid results, but it does appear to support the
argument that relatively little knapping was undertaken at
41HR121 other than limited retouch and resharpening.

Discussion ofDebitage Analysis
Several suggestions regarding lithic reduction at
41HR121 and 41HR33 and how these sites relate to the nearby
sites Peggy Lake sites are made by this debitage analysis.
Early-stage reduction seems to be the case at 41HR33 as it
does at 41HR581. Later stages of reduction are indicated at
41HR121and41HR124. However, thedatafrom41HR121
indicate even later stages of reduction than those of 41HR124.
Moreover, it appears that the debitage from 41HR121 may in
fact reflect only minimal retouch or sharpening oflithic implements at the site during quite possibly a single habitation
episode (based on the argument that the ephemeral nature
of the site may attest to only one or a few short-term
occupation(s) [see Chapter 7]).
The attributes utilized in this analysis-dorsal cortex,
chip/chunk cortex, platform cortex, maximum dimension, and
platform facets-have all been related to stages within the
reduction sequence (Tomka et al. 1988). Low instances of
cortex (both on the dorsal face of the flake and on the platform) are indicative of the later stages of reduction. Inversely,
high instances of cortex are indicative of the earlier stages.
The near absence of primary flakes (only one example) and
the high frequency of tertiary flakes (80 percent) at 41HR121
attests to later stages of reduction at the site. In addition,
the high frequency of flakes in the under 10-mm range is also
indicative of later-stage trimming. Although not documented
as a category, it was noted during the debitage analysis that
the majority of the small flakes were indeed small pressure
flakes presumably detached while resharpening already finished tools.
Chert color differs somewhat between sites 41HR121
and 41HR33 and the Peggy Lake sites. Color frequencies are
quite similar at41HR121and41HR33. This is probably due
to their close proximity and inferred relationship (41HR121
being an upslope extension of the 41HR33/terrace site complex). These frequencies differ somewhat from those of the
Peggy Lake sites. The brown/yellow variety is the most prominent at all sites, however the gray/light gray variety is the
second most common typeat41HR121 and41HR33. On the
other hand, at 41HR124 gray/light gray is the least prominent color, and it is the second least prominent at 41HR581.
The total number of gray/light gray flakes at all the sites is
relatively low, ranging between 6 and 28 flakes total. These
numbers could in fact represent the reduction of only one or
two cobbles of gray material per site. The largest of the gray
flakes from 41HR121 fluoresced a bright orange indicating
that it may in fact be Edwards chert, perhaps from Colorado
or Brazos River gravels that originate on the Edwards Pia-

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

200

teau (Garner 1967:3). This probably indicates trade or interaction with people who had access to such raw materials,
but the possibility of extensive individual or group ranges
cannot be ruled out.
Gadus (1990:290) points out that in noncoastal lithic
technologies, raw material is often reduced at the source
and transported back to habitation sites in a preform stage.
This would in tum lead to only secondary and tertiary flakes,
indi cati ve of the later stage of lithic reduction, being deposited at habitation sites. Because the complete reduction sequence is indicated on both brown/yellow and red/light red
lithic material at the Peggy Lake sites, Gadus argues that the
size of the Willis Formation gravels was small enough to
allow for the transport of unreduced pebbles to these habitation sites. This hypothesis is supported by the debitage
assemblage from 41 HR33 where all stages of reduction are
present as is a solitary specimen of unreduced material.
Extraregional materials, such as gray/light gray Edwards
chert, should presumably show up in the archeological record
of the coastal sites in the later stages of reduction. This
does appear to be the case at41HR121and41HR33 with the
exception of one small chunk from 41HR33 that still retains
considerable cortex.
Cross-comparison of the debitage assemblages from
41HR121 and 41HR33 with those of the Peggy Lake sites
demonstrates the usefulness of maintaining equivalent analysis categories in order to facilitate such comparisons. The
data from this suite of sites reflects the variety of lithic reduction that occurred at each site. Complete reduction sequences are represented at Peggy Lake sites 41HR124 and
41HR581. Site41HR33 appears to be the locale of initial reduction with unreduced raw material still present, but given
collection biases (i.e., little or no screening) it is unclear
whether final-stage lithic reduction took place there as well.
The latter scenario is suggested by the observation that
over 40 percent of the flakes recovered lacked cortex (see
Table 23). Meanwhile, the debitage assemblage upslope at
4lHR121 almost exclusively reflects late reduction stages. If
41HR121 is in fact a discrete single occupation, the debitage
may reflect only the resharpening of tools that were used
during plant and food processing at the site.
The debitage data is also in concurrence with the conclusions of Gadus, wherein the assemblages from all four
sites indicate that regional resources were most often utilized. Extraregional lithic resources, although present, are
found only in limited quantities and represent almost exclusively late-stage lithic reduction.

OTIIERLITIIlCARTIFAcrS
The other recovered stone artifacts that are not chipped
stones consist of 10 pebbles and a siltstone fragment from
41HR121, and 1 chert cobble, 1 siltstone abrader, and 17
siltstone fragments from 41HR33. Because siltstone is not
part of the natural site, the fragments are considered to be

cultural manuports. In addition, the weights and counts of
several other natural and cultural elements at 41HR121 are
also reported in this section. These include caliche nodules
and several burned clay specimens. No such materials were
collected by Neyland from 41HR33.
Unmodified Pebbles/Cobbles
Six small chert pebbles ranging in size from 20 to 25 mm
were recovered from 41HR121. These specimens are unmodified and may be gastroliths that were too small to be utilized.
While their surfaces are generally smooth, they cannot be
described as polished. Although they may be gastroliths
that were ingested only a short time prior to the death of the
animal and therefore did not have ample time to acquire a
polish, their exact nature remains undetermined. Aten's
(1983:342-346) arguments that the diminutive size of the
pebbles makes them unlikely candidates for human utilization as well as the fact that there are no other known natural
forces depositing small pebbles of this nature along Buffalo
Bayou supports the gastrolith assumption.
Four other small pebbles of undetermined material were
also recovered from 4 lHRl 21. They range in size from 10-23
llIIL

A chert cobble (Specimen 33CR-4) (Willis Formation
variety) was recovered from 41HR33. It is also unmodified.
Due to the scarcity of chert material in the region, this is a
peculiar find. Despite sampling biases, a portion of the
debitage from this site clearly represents initial stages of
lithic reduction. This specimen may be a piece of raw material misplaced before reduction began or, quite possibly, a
modem intrusion.
Siltstone
Only one fragment of siltstone was recovered from
41 HR121. It is a small, rounded fragment weighing only 9 .5
g. Siltstone is defined here as a hard, well -indurated sedimentary stone that can be disintegrated only under moderate to heavy pressure. It resembles a somewhat coarsegrained limestone or very fine-grained sandstone.
The collection from 41HR33 (2,665.7 g) consists ofone
burned specimen weighing 290.5 g and 17 unburned specimens weighing 2,375.2 g. All of the unburned specimens are
white to light gray, fine grained, and tabular with rounded
edges. The burned specimen from 41HR33 retains a pink
hue.
All of the siltstone specimens appear to be unmodified
with the exception of one from 41HR33. This piece measures
5.97-x-51.6-x-12.6 mm and has a small groove measuring 11.9
mm wide by 2.2 mm deep running down the extent of one
face. The uniformity of the groove suggests it has been
intentionally produced. The artifact is believed to be a small
siltstone abrader.
Gadus (1990:292) notes that siltstone, although occur-

Appendix C: Lithic Analysis

ring naturally in the Beaumont Formation, is not found in the
Peggy Lake area. Aten (1967: 10) and others have suggested
that it may crop out on the bottom of Clear Lake. Its ultimate
arrival at the Peggy Lake sites, 41HR121, and 41HR33 is
most likely manual transport.
Due to the friable nature of the siltstone, functional
interpretations are problematic. Aten (1983:266) assigned an
abrading or grinding function to similar artifacts. Gadus
(1990:292) notes that the abundance of modified bones at
the Peggy Lake sites suggests the use of the siltstone as
abraders. However, she reports that no specimens show direct evidence of use perhaps because the surface of the
friable material is easily eroded, and all but the most deeply
incised specimens may have been "erased" over time. The
burned specimen may represent a hearthstone.

Caliche Nodules
Sellards et al. (1932:791) note that caliche nodules are
quite common in the Beaumont Formation. Like the Peggy
Lake sites (Gadus and Howard 1990:311), 41HR121 also had
deposits of caliche nodules. The collection from this site
consists of 105 specimens totaling 509.0 g and ranging in
size from 6.5-45 mm (averaging between 15 and 20 mm). Although a few specimens were recovered from the upper levels of the site, the majority were collected from just above
and within the Beaumont Formation. Gadus and Howard
( 1990: 311) suggest that these nodules may be humanly transported based on their high percentage at 41HR124 compared
to other Peggy Lake sites. While this may indeed be possible, the provenience of the nodules at 41HR121 suggests
that they are associated with the Beaumont Formation and
are not cultural.
The exterior surface color of the nodules ranges from
white to pink with a few specimens exhibiting a slightly yellowish color. This is similar to the nodules from the Peggy
Lake sites (Gadus and Howard 1990:311). Only one specimen (Lot 217) has evidence of burning indicated by increasingly darker shades of gray (Lintz 1988:15-16). Lintz (1988:4)
has suggested that the white, pink, and yellow shades of the
majority of the specimens are likely acquired from minerals
dissolved in groundwater.
BumedOay
Twelve burned clay specimens weighing 29.5 g were
recovered from 41HR121. None are from noted concentrations of burned material. Within the sample, two different
types of burned clay exist. The first is comprised of three
specimens totaling 5.1 g. These are lumpy specimens that
were recovered from just above the Beaumont Formation.
In addition, they have similar coloring to that of the caliche
nodules (white/pink), which was probably acquired in the
same manner. They do not react to dilute hydrochloric acid
and are considered to be natural. The second sample con-

201

sists of nine specimens totaling 24.4 g and averaging 19.4
mm in maximum dimension. All of these specimens are dark
reddish brown and quite angular. With the exception of
one specimen from Level 5 (the prehistoric strata), they all
come from Level 2 (within or just beneath the historic deposits). In addition, several specimens have a relatively
flat facet. The appearance of these specimens as well as
their provenience in the upper levels of the site suggests
that they may be crude, heavily eroded historic brick fragments.

SUMMARY
The recovered lithic artifacts from41HR121and41HR33
are consistent with Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations at the site. Because Gary points are commonly found
in Late Prehistoric lithic assemblages, the two sites may represent only Late Prehistoric occupations. Whatever the case
may be, the higher frequency of arrow points than dart points
appears to indicate a more intense utilization of these two
sites during the Late Prehistoric. The two Class A-1/
Catahoula-like points from 41HR33 may represent affiliations
with East Texas. When coupled with the fact that the material from which they are made appears to be extraregional,
the likelihood of this is even greater.
The debitage assemblage from each site seems to represent varying stages oflithic reduction. At 41HR33, all stages
of reduction are represented. Although the recovery techniques at this site notably bias the collection toward larger
specimens, the fact that large specimens are present is significant. Site 41HR121 had one or two large flakes, significantly fewer than 41HR33. It is likely that if fine-screen
samples were collected from 41HR33, later reduction stages
would be present there as well. The assemblage from
41HR121 clearly represents late stages of lithic reduction. In
addition, the low frequency of lithic material at the site
coupled with a thin veneer of shell may represent only a
distinct, short-term occupation. The high frequency of minuscule, tertiary flakes seems to indicate only limited trimming or resharpening of prefabricated lithic tools. Comparison of both Buffalo Bayou sites to nearby sites at Peggy
Lake (mainly 4 lHRl 24 and 41 HR581) revealed distinct similarities and some differences in terms of lithic raw material
use and reduction strategies. The Peggy Lake sites yielded
evidence of a greater range of lithic reduction stages while
41HR121 represents a more-restricted range, consistent with
the inference of only one, or at most a few, short-term
occupation(s) there. The collection from site 41HR33 is clearly
biased toward large specimens but nevertheless yielded more
evidence of very early stage lithic reduction than did any of
the other sites.
While the occupation of 41HR121 appears to have been
short term, the higher tool count at 41HR33 seems to reflect
a greater utilization of the area over time. Similarly, the presence of siltstone also supports this hypothesis. If this mate-

rial was manually transported to the site it represents some
degree of effort, even if it accumulated over time. However,
its absence from 41HRl21 may indicate that this site was not
as intensively utilized which further supports the idea that it
represents a single occupation episode.
Comparison of the data from sites 41HRl21 and 41HR33
with Peggy Lake sites 41HR124 and 41HR581 allowed the
definition of a range oflithic reduction activities within this
complex of sites. By revealing the homogeneity oflithic material and technology in the area, the analysis further highlight uncommon materials in the assemblages that may indicate extraregional interaction. One interesting similarity that
was noted was the presence ofGadus's Group II arrow points
at site 41HR33. When visually compared, the points are quite
similar. Although not conclusive, the similarities in these
distinctive points may represent the workmanship, style, or

technique of a single individual. Were this the case, this
arrow point type (and perhaps others) might eventually serve
to track the movements of an individual knapper across the
landscape.
Overall, the data derived from 41HR121, 41HR33, and
the Peggy Lake sites reflect a variety of knapping activities
and lithic utilization across the area. Further work in the area
can build on and refine the interpretations presented here
and in the Peggy Lake report (Gadus and Howard 1990),
provided that future researchers utilize comparable data and
make an effort to cross-compare it. Also, echoing a suggestion by Gadus (1990:290), future research to identify lithic
material sources used by coastal groups will assist in better
understanding group movements and regional interactions.
Replicative studies aimed at siltstone utilization may also be
a beneficial avenue for research.

Appendix D: Ceramic Analysis

INTRODUCITON
This appendix describes the analysis of prehistoric ceramics in the Neyland Collection as well as those recovered
during recent resurvey and testing investigations conducted
by TARL. Other than the pottery in Neyland Collection, none
of the ceramics reportedly collected from sites other than
those investigated by TARL were available for restudy. Nonetheless, TARL testing and examination of those five localities (41HR.405,41HR577,41HR.680,41HR.681,and41:HR685)
suggests that it is highly unlikely that these sherds were
recovered from intact archeological deposits. No sites that
may have once existed at those localities now survive or
remain above water.
The Neyland Collection materials examined include a
large number of prehistoric ceramics from 41HR33 as well as
much smaller quantities of sherds from 41HR104 and
41HR122. The ceramics were recovered during surface collections and limited excavations conducted by Neyland at
sites along the southeastern (right) bank of Buffalo Bayou,
between 1957 and 1959 (see Chapter 7 and Appendix N). The
41 HR33 collection includes nearly 2,400 sherds, over 1,000
of which have been sorted into 40 individual vessel batches
or sets. Research priority was granted to the vessel portion
of the collection. Less emphasis was placed on the loose
sherds, but the potential of this dataset to yield additional
meaningful data was also assessed. Six sherds from 4 lHRl 04
and two sherds from 41HR122 were also examined. Documentary records and other collections from the Neyland sites
(including historic artifacts from 4 lHRl 21) are described in
other appendices to this report.
In addition to the analysis of existing collections, prehistoric ceramics recovered during TARL investigations were
also examined. Most of this material was generated as the
result of the discovery and subsequent testing of a small
upslope portion of site 41HR121. These investigations generated over 300 prehistoric sherds and associated archeological material from thin, buried shell lens(es) believed to
represent only one or a few occupations during the early
Ceramic period. The TARL 41HR121 collection was analyzed
in much greater detail than the loose sherds from 41HR33.
This appendix opens with a brief overview of Upper
Texas Coast ceramics, including typological issues related
to sherd-heavy assemblages and the terminology employed
in this study. The results are then presented. The Neyland
Collection sites are considered first, followed by the assemblages recovered during TARL investigations. After both
databases are introduced, the section following discusses
the results from these sites and compares them to similar
sites and collections elsewhere in the Galveston Bay area.
The appendix closes with detailed descriptions of each of
the 40 vessel sets from 41HR33.

OVERVIEWOFUPPER TEXAS COAST
PREIDSTORICCERAMICS
Aten's (1979, 1983a) Upper Texas Coast typology and
Galveston Bay area chronology have been reviewed in Chapter 4. The objective of the following is not to repeat the
discussion presented there but instead to illustrate certain
difficulties in applying existing "type-variety" definitions to
sherd collections and to explain the terminology followed in
this study. The typological categories used here incorporate suggestions and observations previously made by other
researchers (e.g., Howard 1990; Weinstein 1991). They are
not intended to replace Aten's existing typology, merely to
fully and efficiently describe the ceramic variability
enountered during the course of this analysis.
Prehistoric ceramics first appeared in the Galveston Bay
area about 2,000 years ago. The greatest diversity of types
occurred in the earliest ceramic period, the Clear Lake period, from ca. A.D. 100 to A.D. 425 (Aten 1983a). They include
types found in the Lower Mississippi Valley and coastal
Louisiana, indicating strong influence, if not outright diffusion, of ceramic styles and technology from these more easterly regions or areas.
A distinctive ceramic tradition emerged out of this early
period. It is characterized by various sandy-paste wares referred to collectively as Goose Creek. Story (1990) suggests
that Goose Creek pottery represents a broad, Southeastern
Texas cultural tradition she terms "Mossy Grove." Goose
Creek ceramics appear to have been made using local clays.
Larger sand grains or crushed sherds (grog) was added as
temper during some periods. Grain-size analyses of Beaumont Formation clay sediments from Peggy Lake (Howard
1990: Table 56) indicate that most variation occurs in the fine
sand (0.25 to 0.125 rnrn) and very fine sand (0.125 to 0.0625
mm) ranges. Upper Texas Coast pots were manufactured
primarily by coiling, as indicated by frequent fractures along
coil junctures. Vessels were sometimes formed using a flat
clay slab for the base, to which coils were added. Surfaces
were often further smoothed by burnishing. Typical vessel
forms are variants of small- to medium-sized jars and bowls
with rounded bases and relatively straight (vertical) walls
(Ricklis 1994:Figure 7.6; Howard 1990:Figure61; Ring 1994).
Cornrnon decorative elements and techniques include incising and application of a red pigment wash or film. Less common decorative treatments include punctation, rocker stamping, excising, and very rarely, cord-marking, most of which
are restricted to the earliest Oear Lake period in the Galveston
Bay seriation chronology. Decoration is typically restricted
to the upper portion of the vessel, along and below the rim
(Aten 1983a; Black 1989). Secondary decorative elements
include notching, scalloping, cross-hatching, and crenelation
of the lip (e.g., Ricklis 1994: 192-212). Early ceramics in the

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

208

Galveston Bay area tend to be low-fired (soft).
Many details regarding the manufacturing process are
unknown (e.g., Black 1988). Ellis (1992) has argued that the
complexity of prehistoric ceramic technology on the Upper
Texas Coast has been largely ignored and that well conceived technological analyses may yield important explanatory and chronological insights.
Difficulties with Existing Ceramic Typologies
Aten's (1979, 1983a) Upper Texas Coast ceramic chronology is based on the type-variety concept used by Phillip's
(1970) in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Aten's primary concern in developing his typology was chronological. He
wanted to reduce typological ambiguity while retaining, insofar as possible, existing nomenclature and meaningful
variability. Nonetheless, limitations arise when applying
Aten's typological constructs to assemblages comprised
largely or entirely of sherds.
The difficulty originates in Aten's use of decoration,
along with paste and temper characteristics, in the definition
of "types" or major ceramic categories. However, with the
exception of a red film or surface wash, decoration was limited to the upper portion of vessels throughout prehistory
in the Galveston Bay and surrounding areas. But since most
sherds from a broken pot are from the main body of the
vessel, not the rim and near-rim portions, the majority of
sherds from a decorated pot show no evidence of decoration. Decoration will be systematically underrepresented in
calculations based solely on sherd collections. For example,
an untempered sandy-paste body sherd may belong to any
one of three separate types: Goose Creek Plain, Goose Creek
Incised, or even Goose Creek Stamped (Aten 1983a). The
same is true of Tchefuncte Plain or Stamped types. Conversely, no such difficulties are encountered with body
sherds from types defined solely on paste/temper characteristics, such as sand-tempered O'Neal Plain var. Conway.
Consequently, some ceramic analyses (e.g., Howard 1990)
use primarily descriptive paste/temper categories as the basis for sherd analysis and apply Aten's typological criteria
only where possible, to rim sherds and decorated near-rim
sherds.
The situation is even more dramatic (and potentially
confusing) when dealing with grog-tempered wares. Aten
defines two distinct types based on the presence or absence of decoration: Baytown Plain and San Jacinto Incised.
However, because of paste and temper characteristics that
crosscut these types, two varieties are defined for each type.
One class has abundant grog inclusions in a predominately
silty clay paste, and the other is characterized by lesser
amounts of grog that has been added to a basic sandy paste.
Consequently, an undecorated body sherd with abundant
grog and a silty clay paste may be either Baytown Plain var.
Phoenix Lake or San Jacinto Incised var. Spindletop, while a
similar sherd with sandy paste might represent Baytown

Plain var. San Jacinto or San Jacinto Incised var. Jamison.
There is a clear potential for confusion or misunderstanding
Â· arising from such terminological difficulties.
Aten's (1983a:207-221) desire to define unequivocal,
easily recognizable types is clearly constrained by such concerns. These difficulties result for the most part from Aten' s
desire to retain previously defined types and to maintain
typological consistency with adjacent areas such as the
Lower Mississippi Valley (Aten 1983a:207-221).
A partial resolution to such difficulties may lie in
Weinstein's (1991) use of the "series" concept and his suggested redefinition of grog-tempered ceramics. Weinstein
has argued that the term "Baytown" be reserved for only
those ceramics with abundant grog temper in a primarily
silty clay paste, which is more consistent with its usage in
the Lower Mississippi Valley. Weinstein goes on to suggest
that the less abundant grog temper characteristically added
to a basic sandy paste may reflect a local, indigenous type
(which he terms the San Jacinto series) that developed out
of earlier Goose Creek tradition. He proposes that the Goose
Creek/San Jacinto sandy-paste tradition may be culturally
related to Akokisa and Karankawa groups in the Galveston
Bay and Brazos River areas, while the Baytown ceramics
(abundant grog and silty clay paste) may be associated with
Attakapan peoples from the Sabine River area and coastal
Louisiana. Baytown wares are apparently limited to a brief
period of time (ca. A.O. 1300 to 1400) and may represent
"greater contact with the Sabine River area, perhaps even
including a minor intrusion of Attakapa peoples into the
Galveston Bay area" (Weinstein 1991:106).
In Weinstein's (1991) revised typology three broad
classes or "series" are recognized: (1) the Goose Creek series of untempered sandy-paste ceramics; (2) a San Jacinto
series defined by modest grog inclusions added to a basic
Goose Creek sandy paste; and (3) the Baytown series (abundant grog in silty clay paste) that makes a short-lived appearance in the Galveston Bay area. However, within these
series Weinstein retains type names based on presence or
absence of decoration.
In order to avoid the difficulties encountered in accurately typing body sherds, the present study employs a
slightly modified version of Aten's (1979, 1983a) typology,
as amended by Weinstein (1991). Borrowing the series concept, untempered sandy-paste sherds for which decorative
status cannot be determined are classified as Goose Creek
untyped (orunspecified). Unless otherwise indicated all references to Goose Creek ceramics in this study are untyped.
Decorated sherds are typed according to Aten's (1983a)
definitions. Weinstein's (1991) distinctions between Baytown
and San Jacinto series are also retained, with body sherds
again classified as "untyped." If the presence or absence of
decoration can be established, a simplified version of
Weinstein's usage is followed. Undecorated ceramics were
typed as simply Baytown Plain or San Jacinto Plain while
decorated sherds were classified as Baytown Incised or San

Appendix D: Ceramic Analysis

Jacinto Incised. Weinstein's (1991 :98-107) varieties are not
used. Identification of all other types and varieties follow
the descriptions provided by Aten (1983a). Sherds in the
Upper Texas Coast type collection at TARL (compiled primarily by Aten) were consulted as needed as well.
In the end, both Aten's and Weinstein's typologies
adequately describe the same ceramic variability. The main
differences between them is terminological. The hybrid
"untyped" approach used in this study is not advocated as
a replacement or formal modification of these existing
typologies. Rather, the emphasis is on unambiguously and
efficiently describing variability recognized in the analyzed
collections while avoiding the difficulties when working with
loose sherd collections discussed above. Defining unequivocal types for body sherds, which form the majority of
Upper Texas Coast ceramic assemblages, must be addressed
in future revisions of Upper Texas Coast typology. Paste
and temper characteristics should take precedence in the
definition of types. Because of its restricted occurrence decoration should probably be used only for subtypes or primary varieties. This would of course not preclude the definition of additional secondary varieties based on lip decoration or design motifs (e.g., Ricklis 1994).
TARLANALYSIS
Introduction
TARL ceramic investigations were conducted on assemblages from two sources: sites along Buffalo Bayou investigated by Wayne B. Neyland in the mid to late 1950s and
sites recently surveyed and tested by TARL, including one
of the sites (41HR121) recorded previously by Neyland. The
vast majority of the Neyland Collection material analyzed is
from site 41HR33. As was the case with the lithic analysis
presented in Appendix C, the ceramic analysis was designed
and structured to facilitate comparison with data from similar prehistoric sites in the nearby Peggy Lake Disposal Area
(Gadus and Howard 1990); as well as other sites in the
Galveston Bay area such as Lido Harbor (41 GV82; Weinstein
1991; see also Aten 1983b). However, research objectives
and requirements differed between the Neyland Collection
and TARU41HR121 assemblages. Each was therefore analyzed somewhat differently. The following section provides
additional background, describes the methodologies used,
and presents the results of analysis. This is followed by a
separate discussion section.

State Park. Distinct lenses could be observed in portions of
the site, which was rapidly eroding due to heavy ship traffic
in the channel. A large amount of prehistoric pottery, bone,
and other cultural material was being displaced along with
the shell. Over the next two years, Neyland returned to the
site dozens of times to collect artifacts and to conduct limited excavations. Further exploration along the bankline and
adjacent valley margin revealed at least five other site localities (41HR104, 41HR105, 41HR121, 41HR122, and41HR123).
However, little was done at these smaller locations. Neyland's
investigations are recorded in a series of field notebooks
and photographs now housed at TARL (see Appendix N).
Neyland definitely concentrated his efforts at 41HR33.
He first maintained some provenience control by identifying
loci of apparent high artifact density such as Areas 1, 2, and
3. He later established a rough grid of 5-ft squares over the
site to organize his collection efforts and also identify several areas he believed to be cultural features such as "Fire
Pits" 1 and 2. However, no vertical (or elevational) provenience standard was established. Instead depth was calculated from the top of the shell lens in each unit, regardless of
its relative thickness. This lack of vertical control limits interpretation of stratigraphic relationships within the midden,
although artifacts recovered from the overlying "black clay"
stratum can confidently be considered to postdate the period of shell accumulation. The ceramic collection from
41HR33 eventually grew to slightly more than 2,500 individual sherds (see below). This includes 27 partial vessels
identified by Neyland as well as 13 others identified by TARL
(see below). Virtually all of the 41HR33 sherds have some
provenience information written directly on them by Neyland
in black ink. Neyland also collected several prehistoric sherds
from sites 41HR104 and 41HR122.
In addition to ceramics, the Neyland collection from
41HR33 contains chipped stone lithics, ground stones, bone
artifacts, faunal remains, macrobotanical remains, sediment
samples, shell samples, and miscellaneous artifacts. All
nonceramic materials from 41HR33 and the other Neyland
sites are described in Chapter 7 and other appendices to this
report. These include historic artifacts originally assigned
to 41HR121. However, as described elsewhere in this report,
the historic material should more properly be considered
part of an historic site (41HR576) which occupies the upland
and valley slope and partially overlaps the more deeply buried 41HR121.
Methods

Neyland Collection

Background
Neyland discovered site 41HR33 on March 30, 1957 (see
Appendix N, Chapter 7). The site was a large, Late Prehistoric shell midden exposed along roughly 100' (ca. 30+ m) of
bankline on the southeastern (right) bank of the Houston
Ship Channel, just south of the San Jacinto Battleground

Initial sorting of the ceramics from 41HR33 was done by
Hood in the summer and early fall of 1998. Once it became
apparent how much material there was and in light of the
limited scope of work and available resources for this preliminary testing project, focus was first on inventorying the
existing vessel batch and loose sherd collections and second on analytical and descriptive efforts on the partially

reconstructed vessels. It was hoped that the effort to record
count and provenience information for both the loose sherds
and vessels would be helped by, and also complement, a
concurrent analysis of Ney land's field notebooks and other
documentation (see Appendix N and Chapter 7). Nearly all
of the sherds had some provenience information written on
them, although the degree of specificity varied greatly. For
example, elevation ranges are frequently given (e.g., 0-6"
and 0-10" depth) and horizontal proveniences (e.g., Area 1
and Square E0-5') often partially overlap or refer to the same
location. Both practices, along with the large number of artifacts recovered from the surface (i.e., after they had been
eroded and moved to an unknown degree), add a significant
measure of uncertainty to reconstructing the three-dimensional distribution of artifacts from the site.
During the course of initially sorting and inventorying
the loose sherds, 13 additional vessels were recognized. Each
was assigned a letter designation to distinguish them from
Ney land's original 27, and they added to the vessel collection. Only large sherds or refit sets that formed a significant
portion of the rim, bocfy, or base were thus added to the
vessel collection.
Unlike the Peggy Lake study (Howard 1990) no distinction is made in this report between vessel batches (sherds
from a single vessel that have not or cannot be refitted) and
sections (partially reconstructed portion of vessel). While
the distinction between sections and batches is descriptively useful and provides some indication of the completeness and quality of the data, it fails to account for sherd sets
composed of both loose sherds and one or more reconstructed fragments which nonetheless clearly belong together. It also fails to take into account the effort expended
at reconstruction, or the anticipated success of future at-

tempts to do so. Indeed most of the vessels from 41HR33 are
represented by both loose sherds and one or more refitted
segments. The complexity of each vessel set requires more
in-depth descriptions to adequately convey both the potential and limitations of each dataset. Therefore, detailed descriptions of each vessel are provided at the end of this
appendix. The following discussion most often refers simply to the vessel or vessel set, with more descriptive terms
(such as vessel section) employed as necessary.
Attributes recorded for each vessel set, where possible,
include orifice diameter, minimum height, lip form and decoration (e.g., notching or scalloping), rim orientation, base
shape and size, and surface smoothing (e.g., burnishing). In
addition, vessels were examined for evidence of repair such
as mending holes and clay patching. Vessel form is described
wherever possible using a combination of geometric shapes
("spherical" and "cylindrical," sensu Rice 1987) and terms
such as 'jar'' and "bowl;" the latter based primarily on height/
orifice diameter ratios rather than functional connotation.
The term "bowl" is used for vessels with orifice diameters
greater than their height while "jar" indicates the opposite
relationship. The use of such terms is consistent with previous usage in Upper Texas Coast ceramic research (e.g.,
Ambler 1967; Ring 1994; Weinstein 1991). Thickness measurements were made using dial calipers and are reported to
the nearest 0.1 cm. Additional measurements and observations related to Hood's (1998) Master's research were also
made and are included in the descriptions although they are
not discussed here. Final typological assignments were done
byTakac.
Whenever it was clear that two or more sherds could in
fact be refit, they were either glued together using the a
standard B-72 adhesive mixture or placed in a single, labeled

Appendix D: Ceramic Analysis

plastic bag. Where regluing would result in unstable sections, chalk marks were made indicating how the separate
pieces fit together, following the same procedure used earlier by Neyland.
The loose sherds were examined in much less detail
than were the vessel sets. Nonetheless, all were examined in
terms of overall morphology (e.g., decoration, rim or base
fragments) and visible paste characteristics. Only a
subsample of (perhaps 10 percent) were examined under 1020X magnification in the same manner as the sherds recovered from 41 HR121 (discussed below). This was done primarily to conclusively determine paste characteristics and aplastic inclusions.
Individual size or thickness measurement were not recorded for sherds in the Neyland Collection. They are, however, much larger on average than the 41HR121 sample (see
below). This undoubtedly reflects differences in field recovery methods. The 41HR33 sample was surface collected or
screened through only 112-inch mesh, while all sediment
from TARL test excavations was screened through 1/8-inch
mesh and in some cases 1/ 16-inch mesh.
41HR33 Vessel Collection
Neyland identified and defined a total of27 partial vessels from 41HR33. They were assigned sequential numbers
that generally conform to the order of field recovery or laboratory sorting and labeling (which appears to have taken
place soon after recovery). Individual sherds (both refitted
and loose) belonging to the same vessel batch are generally
marked with both whatever horizontal and vertical provenience information was available and occasionally with the
vessel number as well. Thirteen additional vessel sets resulting from TARL analysis were assigned letters in order of
discovery (A through M). The sherds in these sets have not
been relabeled but have been bagged separately with an
identifying tag.
Table 26 lists counts and proveniences of all sherds
contained in the 40 41HR33 vessel batches. Provenience
information, written on the sherds by Neyland, is provided
verbatim along with the translation of Ney land's code into
horizontal and vertical provenience units as described in
Chapter 7. Site and county codes ("HSC#4/Ha-S," denoting
Neyland's site name, "Houston Ship Channel #4," and Harris County) were also written on most of the sherds but have
not been included. The number of sherds that are definitely
part of the vessel is given as are the number of sherds that
possibly or probably belong to the vessel batch. The total
sherd count within each provenience unit and for each vessel is also provided.
Table 26 clearly indicates that some vessel sets are comprised of sherds recovered from different proveniences, some
of which are even refits. For example, the 50 sherds in the
Vessel 10 set represent 21 separate provenience designations as well as one sherd with no information whatsoever.

219

Vessel H on the other hand has 25 sherds, all from the same
provenience. There are a couple of reasons for this. As already mentioned, Neyland's provenience designations were
not mutually exclusive and frequently overlap in both horizontal and vertical space. In light of this, each provenience
designation (no matter how different) was kept separate.
Close examination of some vessel sets reveals that they are
from the same general area while in other cases their horizontal or stratigraphic positions are quite different. In all
cases where combination proveniences are indicated on
Table 26 (e.g., Area 1/E0-5') the sherds were either labeled
thus or a glued, refitted section included sherds from two or
more proveniences.
Another potential reason for discrepant proveniences
within vessel sets is the rapid erosion during the two years
during which Neyland collected this material. He frequently
collected artifacts and bone that had clearly just been washed
out of the bankline profile but reworked up- or downstream
to an unknown degree. Prehistoric factors might also account for the observed dispersal of those pieces. Culturally
patterned human behaviors such as the secondary disposal
of material broken elsewhere or the reuse of larger fragments
for other purposes (perhaps in different areas of the site) are
just a few of the potential mechanisms that may influence
the spread of artifacts prior to final burial (e.g., Schiffer 1976).
The effect of natural processes like floods and downslope
movement also disturb original distributions, particularly if
artifacts are exposed at the surface for an extended period
prior to burial. A final, although relatively minor possible
contributor to the within-vessel provenience diversity is simply mistaken or misrecorded information. Given the tremendous amount of material he collected (both on individual
trips and cumulatively), the ready-mobility of artifacts along
the beach surface, the constant difficulty in maintaining datum positions, and the often adverse field conditions (such
as periodic swamping thanks to passing ships), it is a testament to Neyland's meticulous and dedicated efforts that
such problems appear to be quite rare. Nonetheless, in a few
cases transposed numbers or letters are clearly the best explanation for discrepencies or anomalous isolates.
Considerable variation exists in the degree of reconstruction that has been or may be done on these vessels.
Some, like Vessel 1, are nearly complete (Figure 61) while
others have few refits.
The 41 HR33 vessel collection contains a total of 1,076
sherds, representing 40 individual vessels. Unlike the loose
sherds, each sherd in the vessel collection was counted
individually on Table 26. The number of sherds in the 27
vessel batches designated by Neyland is 922 (or 85.7 percent). The remaining 154 sherds, representing an additional
13 vessel sets, were defined by TARL. Of the former group,
695 (75.4 percent) were judged by Hood to be "definitely"
part of their assigned vessel sets. In the TARL vessel group,
a somewhat higher percentage (130 of 154 sherds, or 84.4
percent) were considered "definite" constituents.

Figure 62). The remainder are more difficult to classify, but
all appear to fall within the range of known Upper Texas
Coast vessel types (e.g., Howard 1990:Figure 61; Ricklis
1994:Figure 7.6; Ring 1994). Some of the vessels are quite
large and have relatively straight walls (Figure 63; compare
to Figure 62).
None of the vessels is complete enough to measure a
continuous rim to base profile. However, minimum height
has been calculated for 31 of the vessel sets (see Table 27).
These values range from 4.1 to 20.4 cm, with an average of
10.9. Seven are greater than 15 cm (22.6 percent), and 15 (48.4
percent) are less than 10 cm. Orifice diameter was also estimated for 19 vessels using a graph of concentric circles
spaced 1 cm apart. The range of orifice diameters was 12.0
cm to 35.0 cm. However, most fall into two groups: four vessels (21 percent) between 9 and 12 cm and 10 (53 percent)
between 20 and 25 cm, with 2 others only slightly larger
(Vessel No. 10 at 27.0 cm and Vessel 21at28 cm).
Lip and/or rim characteristics could be determined on
26 vessels (65 percent; see Table 27). Lip form was highly
variable, such as flat to rounded, sometimes on the same
sherd. Scalloping and notching was noted on several of the
vessels (Figure 64). Over half (n=15 of26, or 57.7 percent) of
the rims were judged to everted or possibly be everted while
only 3 (or 11.5%) were inverted, including a very poorly
formed rim sherd from Vessel 7. Three or four of the rims
were direct, and the remainder (4, or 15 .4 percent) were slightly
excurving.
Eleven bases were included among the 40 vessels (see
Table 27). Only one (9 .1 percent, from Vessel 25) was flat, the
remainder being rounded (n=5, 45.6 percent), probably
rounded (n=2, 18.2 percent), or conical (n=2, 18.2 percent).
Both conical bases, as well as a rounded one, also had distinct nodes (Figure 65). The interior of one of the conical
bases (Vessel A) is rounded.
Half of the vessels exhibit clear or likely evidence of burnishing of the interior and/or exterior surfaces. Other vessels
have very poorly smoothed exterior surfaces (Figure 66). Exterior surface finishes on vessels at the nearby Peggy Lake
sites (Howard 1990:249) were highly variable, even across the
surface of the same vessel. Approximately 56 percent of the
Peggy Lake vessels exhibited some degree of burnishing.
A remarkable aspect of the 41HR33 vessel collection
(and the loose sherds from this site) is the evidence for
extensive repair, including both clay patching and mending
holes. The latter are typically drilled from one surface. The
observed gradation of mending hole shape, from distinctly
conical to almost cylindrical, may be due to gradual widening of the passage by the friction of the fibers that once
filled them. Mending holes in sherds typically occur singly
but judging from reconstructed vessel sections, probably
originally occurred in pairs or groups of three (see Figure
63a). The holes are not restricted to one portion of the
vesselo/.ithey may occur below the rim, on the vessel wall,
and even on the base. The lack of evidence for the use of

223

waterproofing or sealing material such as asphaltum suggests that at least some of these containers served a purpose other than holding liquid. At the Lido Harbor site
(41 GV82), Weinstein (1991 :98, 104) noted several examples
of asphaltum applied to the interior and/or exterior of a number of sherds, none of which was believed to be decorative.
Mending holes occur on seven vessels from 41 HR33 as well
as dozens of loose sherds.
Clay patching is apparently quite rare in Upper Texas
Coast ceramic assemblages but is amply represented at
41HR33. This was apparently done by applying a thick slip
or secondary coat of clay over a crack either before initial
firing or afterward. In the latter case, the pot was evidently
refired (or the clay exposed to high temperatures without
further damaging or cracking the vessel) as the patches are
sintered and hardened. It appears that at least some patching took place before the pot was completely dried, as indicated by score marks exposed beneath one of the patches,
presumably to help secure the clay patch (Figure 67). Neyland
reports that Worthington recovered sherds with similar clay
patching at Peggy Lake (Neyland field notebooks on file at
TARL; Appendix N).
Finally Vessels 19 and 22 (and perhaps Vessel 26) have
a unique decorative element and may represent a previously
unknown ceramic variety or type in the Galveston Bay area.
Both vessels have distinct banding: areas of red or orange
separated from darker (dark gray to blackish) areas by a
straight, well-defined line running perpendicular to the rim
(Figure 68). In the case of Vessel No. 19, the orange areas
appear to be caused by intense oxidation, while the darker
areas appear reduced. One possible means of achieving this
effect would be applying an organic substance prior to firing and then burning it off (Linda W. Ellis, personal communication 1997). The vessel is also decorated with two narrow
incised lines just below the lip and another, running parallel
to the others, roughly 3.5 cm farther down on the body.
Vessel No. 22 on the other hand clearly has traces of a red
pigment or paint adhering to the more-oxidixed (and heavily
eroded) area. The adjacent darker segment is again apparently more reduced and burnished. The latter surface is receding somewhat from the clear, distinct boundary between
it and the lighter, reddish area. There is no evidence of red
pigment on Vessel No. 19, although it may have flaked off.
The third vessel (No. 26) consists of only a body and partial
base section and associated loose sherds. An area of reddish pigment is found on a sherd near the base. Other sherds
in the vessel set appear burnished to a dark gray color which
has eroded in places, exposing a highly oxidized
undersurface. Without the upper portion of Vessel 26, it is
not possible to confidently determine ceramic type except
insofar as the presence of red pigment suggests it probably
is Goose Creek Red-filmed (Aten 1983a). In addition to the
vessels, five other sherds with similar unique coloration and
apparent banding were found among the loose sherds from
41HR33.

used for flotation and screened through 1116-inch (ca. 0.15
cm) mesh. The extensive use of 118-inch screen mesh contributed significantly to the recovery of smaller artifacts,
including ceramic sherds.
TARL survey and testing of other site localities in the
project area were limited to surface survey and shovel tests
(see Chapter 6).
Methods
Sherds from TARL investigations at 41HR121 were examined in much greater detail than were those in the Neyland
collection. All were examined under at least 1OX magnification (and in some cases up to SOX). Ceramic types were
identified following the same criteria outlined above as well
as comparison to the type collection at TARL. Identification
of sand tempering (O'Neal Plain var. Conway) was based on

---------------------------

[1304]

a distinctly bimodal distribution of sand grain sizes (i.e.,
unlikely to be a natural deposit).
Whenever sherds were large enough, a freshly broken
edge was inspected. Maximum size of all 333 sherds recovered during TARL testing of 41HR121 were determined using
concentric circles in 5-mm increments in the same manner as
described for the lithic debitage in Appendix C. The smallest
circle that enclosed the maximum dimension of the sherd was
recorded as the sherd size. While this procedure masks some
dimensional variability (e.g., long, narrow fragments appear
the same as larger but squarish sherds), it was found to be
efficient and replicable. Maximum thickness was measured
perpendicular to sherd surface(s) using dial calipers to the
nearest 0.1 mm. Broken or heavily eroded sherds were excluded so that thickness measurements were obtained on
roughly two-thirds of the sherds (n=225 of 333, or 67.6 percent). The use of fine-mesh screens permitted the recovery of

Twenty-eight sherds recovered from shovel probes and

ably represents fragments of what was once a single large
sherd.
An additional 305 sherds were recovered during the
subsequent excavation of test units (Table 30). The distribution of maximum sherd size for this sample is shown on Figure 69. Note the small number of the smallest (< 5 mm) sherds,
all of which have a sandy paste. Curiously, most did not
come from proveniences that were submitted for flotation
but rather were retrieved from the 1/8-inch screens in the
field or the laboratory. This small number of sherds represents only 3.9 percent of the entire assemblage, and excluding them from percentage calculations makes very little difference in terms of the entire assemblage. They have been
included in all such calculations, which are based on the full
count of 333 sherds.
There is a definite preponderance of small sherds in the
41HR121 assemblage. More than three-quarters (n=254, or
76.2 percent) of the sherds are smaller than 2.0 cm (see Figure 69; Tables 29 and 30). Only 3.6 percent (n=12) are larger
than 40 mm. The average maximum size is 17.7 mm but with a
standard deviation of9.3 mm.
Maximum sherd thickness measurements were made on
225 specimens. The distribution of these data is depicted on
Figure 70. The thickness measurements are roughly normally distributed with two anomalous peaks at 4.0 and 7.1
mm. Both appear to be largely attributable to numerous
freshly broken fragments (probably during excavation) of
what was almost surely a largeroriginal sherd. Average sherd
thickness is 5.4 mm with a standard deviation of 1.0 mm.
The ceramic assemblage from 41HR121 is very homogenous (Table 31). Over 95 percent (n=318) of the sherds

have sandy paste with no indication of decoration and are
classified as Goose Creek untyped. One specimen each of
Goose Creek Incised and Goose Creek var. Anahuac were
also recovered along with two sherds identified as
Mandeville Plain (see Table 31). The second most numerous
category is comprised of sand-tempered O'Neal Plain var.
Conway sherds but accounts for only 3.3 percent of the
total (n=l l). Three of these appear to be fired coil fragments.
All 11 are from different proveniences (including four different excavation units), suggesting that they did not come
from a single, recently fractured parent sherd. No grog-tempered ceramics wererecoveredfrom41HR121.
Only two refits could be established among the TARL
41HR121 ceramics, although in several cases a marked similarity among sherds from the same or nearby provenience
units suggests some sherds may have once been conjoined.
One refit pair was a rim sherd from the same provenience
(Lot 105.1 ); it may have been broken during excavation. The
other refit pair is more complicated (Lots 136.1 and 159; see
Table 30). These two sherds were separated horizontally by
perhaps as little as 50 cm but were recovered separated vertically by at least 30 cm%the Lot 136.1 sherd in Level 2 and
the Lot 159 sherd in the sealed shell lens in Level 6. The
former was almost certainly displaced upward from an original position in lower, prehistoric deposit by bioturbation or
soil movement. Indications are that all of the prehistoric
material recovered is derived from the thin, buried shell lenses
and that the artifacts, while they may not have been laterally
displaced to any great degree, have been subject to a greater
degree of disturbance in the vertical dimension due to soil
expansion and contraction (vertisolic drying/wetting), earth-

In addition to the ceramic sherds, seven clay balls and
two fragments of what appear to be fired clay slip or patch
fragments were also recovered. They clay balls superficially
appear to be cultural but are probably natural. The thin fragments of possible clay patching are both from the same provenience and probably represent a broken larger piece.

Discussion
The following sections summarize andÂ· elaborate on the
results of the TARL ceramic analysis. Included are the dating of the 41HR33 and 41HR121 assemblages relative to
Aten's ceramic seriation chronology, comparing the results
to similar sites and assemblages in the Galveston Bay area,
and finally assessing the potential of current and future research using vessel collections like that from 41HR33.

41HR577 and41HR685
Dating the 41HR33 and 41HR121 Collections
A small number of sherds were recovered during TARL
resurvey of two other sites in the summer of 1997, 41HR577
and 41HR685. Investigations at both sites are discussed in
detail in Chapter 6.
Three sherds were recovered from Level 2 of Shovel
Test A at 41HR577 on the northwestern (left) bank of Buffalo Bayou, directly across from 41HR121. All three are
untyped Goose Creek sherds (see Table 29) and have dulled
and rounded edges consistent with extended immersion.
Historic and modern material recovered in deeper levels in
the same shovel test also support the inference that these
sherds were secondarily deposited.
Three sherds were collected from the surface of the
shell beach at 41HR685, on the north shore of Atkinson
Island, across from Morgans Point. The smallest of these is
classified as Goose Creek untyped (see Table 29). Both of
the others are grog-tempered. The first is a body sherd with
abundant grog in a very fine to silty sandy paste and is
categorized as Baytown untyped. The other is a base fragment from a fairly flat-bottomed vessel. It has sandy paste
(San Jacinto untyped). All three sherds from 41HR685 have
worn, rounded edges and have presumably been displaced
from original locations in a nearby, now inundated site offshore (see Chapter 6).

Overall the entire 41HR33 collection, both the vessels
and loose sherds, is characterized by a remarkable lack of
decoration and a predominance of sandy-paste Goose Creek
wares. The incised grog-tempered vessels (Vessels 21 and
C) were recovered stratigraphically above the main shell
lens(es). A grog-tempered, flat, noded base sherd was also
recovered above the shell lens in Square WS-10'. The early
ceramic types (O'Neal Plain var. Conway and Goose Creek
var. Anahuac) recovered 3 inches above the shell lens in
Unit S10/W30 are also probably displaced from upslope or
upstream. Taken together, this evidence contributes to the
homogeneity of the overall collection. Along with the small
quantities of other types such as Tchefuncte, Goose Creek
Incised, and Goose Creek Red-filmed these results strongly
suggest a late Clear Lake or Mayes Island occupation of
41HR33 (Aten 1983a). The slightly higher percentages of
early ceramic types at 41HR121 may indicate a somewhat
earlier occupation, but it is quite possible that both were
occupied at the same time and may in fact be different "site
areas" similar to the contemporaneous bankline midden (initial food processing area) and valley margin shell "pockets"
(primary habitation area) at the Lido Harbor (41GV82) site
(Weinstein 1991).

246

The ability to accurately date site 41HR121 will clearly
help guide any future research at the site. The ceramic evidence suggests that occupation(s) were confined exclusively
to the later Clear Lake and perhaps Mayes Island periods.
Unlike the Redtail site (Gadus and Howard 1990) where habitation episodes were limited but spread over a significant
period of time, site 41HR121 appears to offer an opportunity
to investigate discrete site components with spatial resolution on the order of sites 41 CH3 l and 41CHI70 in the Trinity
River Delta (Aten 1983b) or the individual shell ''pockets" at
Lido Harbor (Weinstein 1991 ). The early time period of the
41HR121 components, however, appears to be unique among
the small sites previously excavated elsewhere in the
Galveston Bay area (see Chapter 5).
The potential of the 41HR33 vessel database has only
been partially realized. Nearly 10 percent of existing loose
sherds are already refitted and there is the strong likelihood
of success for finding additional vessels or matches to existing vessel sets.
Upper Texas Coast Hunter-Gatherers and Ceramics
One illustration of the types of studies that may be
done using the 41HR33 vessel collection and others like it is
Hood's (1998) recent Master's thesis research. It suggests
the importance of such studies not just for improving our
understanding of Upper Texas Coast and Galveston Bay
prehistory but also contributing to issues of broader archeological significance.
Hood (1998) begins by noting that the use and production of ceramics by nonagricultural peoples has become a
major research topic following the decoupling of traditional
(but erroneous) understandings of the relationship between
food production, storage, and pottery making (e.g., Barnett
and Hoopes 1995; Brown 1989; Rice 1987; Sassaman 1995).
The Upper Texas Coast, with its nearly 2,000-year record of
ceramic use by seasonally mobile hunter-gatherer groups is
an ideal setting for investigating such questions.
Introduction of the concept of pottery making or even
knowledge of production methods, through mechanisms
such as diffusion, is only the first (and in many ways least
important) step in the eventual adoption of ceramics. To be
adopted, ceramics must be fully integrated into existing cultural and adaptive systems. Many factors potentially constrain the use of pottery by hunter-gatherers, including seasonal scheduling, length of occupation at favorable sites,
and access to suitable raw materials such as fuel and clay
(Arnold 1985). The latter consideration probably presented
few problems for Upper Texas Coast groups due to the extensive Beaumont Formation deposits and abundant riparian vegetation. However, the chief constraint on hunter-gatherer ceramic use is mobility and related aspects of transportation and vessel durability (Arnold 1985; Barnett and Hoopes
1995; Brown 1989; Reid 1984, 1989).
Hood (1998) proposes that there are two fundamentally

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

different solutions to the problem of mobility-related breakage. The first option is decreasing the "cost" of individual
pots by essentially accepting a high breakage rate but offsetting it by at a relatively prodigious production rate (the
"expedient vessel manufacture" hypothesis; Hood 1998).
The other approach is to invest the production of individual
vessels with great effort and care and then minimize the
likelihood of damage by leaving them behind for future use
(the "caching" hypothesis). Building on the expectations
for early ceramics outlined by Brown (1989), Hood develops
a series of test implications for these alternative strategies
that can be tested against vessel collections like that from
41HR33. In the case of"expedient vessel manufacture," pots
are expected to have poorly smoothed and formed walls,
rims, and lips as indicated by easily detected coils (undulating surfaces) and variable thicknesses. In addition, the predominant vessel form would be bowls (which dry quickly
and easily) and, perhaps most importantly, little evidence of
mending or repair; replacement being more efficient. The
alternative strategy ("caching") should be evidenced by
carefully crafted, smoother, and thinner pots which may or
may not have extensive decoration. Because of their increased value, it is anticipated that these vessels should
have evidence of extensive repairs to extend their use-lives
as much as possible. The latter strategy seems particularly
plausible on the Upper Texas Coast where a seasonally transhumant settlement/subsistence pattern was probably established during the Archaic (Aten 1983a; Aten et al. 1976;
Story 1990). Hood recognizes that the actual situation is
almost certainly more complex and that these alternative scenarios are extremes along a continuum. Additional factors,
such as the use of watercraft and the effects of transportation on breakage rates as well as possible use of cordage
wrapping or other means to cushion pots, are difficult to
control for but were undoubtedly important.
A series of measurements and observations on the
41HR33 vessel collection were used to test these hypotheses, with mixed results (Hood 1998). Evidence could be
marshaled to support both hypotheses. Nevertheless, similar studies on larger samples from different times during the
Late Prehistoric may resolve some of these problems. Literally hundreds of partially reconstructed vessels are available. These include ( 1) vessels from published sites such as
those discussed in this report (e.g., Peggy Lake, Lido Harbor, and Mitchell Ridge); (2) unreported curated collections
similar to 41HR33 such as Neyland's collections from site
41HR31 (which appears to include more than a dozen numbered vessel sets and a large amount of loose sherds); (3)
smaller numbers of vessels also curated at TARL and elsewhere; and finally (4) private, undocumented collections.
Unlike chronologically oriented analyses in which provenience is of utmost importance, study of partial vessels and
their attributes may be successfully undertaken even in the
absence of such controls. Analytical effort expended on
vessels (where multiple variables such as form, decoration,

Appendix D: Ceramic Analysis

and manufacturing technique can be controlled on a single
vessel) may then yield or identify relevant attributes that
might then be applied to loose sherd collections where chronology is often better controlled. The observation that Upper Texas Coast ceramic analyses have heretofore focused
primarily on chronological concerns, at the expense of
broader stylistic and technological issues (e.g., Ellis 1992;
Ricklis 1994), merits restating. The inherent limitations of
sherd collections, however, clearly endorse a future research
focus on partially reconstructed vessels.
Comparing the 41HR33 Neyland Collection to Other
Galveston Bay Sites
While it is true that many vessel batches and sections
have been identified on the Upper Texas Coast, comparing
such datasets is often not particularly straightforward. The
results from TARL analysis of the 41HR33 vessel collection
is compared (to the extent possible) to the results from three
recent, extensive excavations in the Galveston Bay area:
Weinstein's (1991) excavations at Lido Harbor (41GV82),
Ricklis's (1994) investigations at the Mitchel Ridge site
(41 GV66), and finally the research conducted by Gadus and
Howard (1990) at sites along Peggy Lake.
Investigations at Lido Harbor yielded 28 partial vessels
(Weinstein 1991:99; Table 7-1). Eight (28.6 percent) were
Goose Creek types, including one Goose Creek Incised. Half
(n=14, 50 percent) were grog tempered: 14 San Jacinto (12
Plain and 2 Incised) and 3 Baytown Plain. Three (10.7 percent) could not be typed. Orifice diameter ranged between
16 and 32 cm, and descriptive vessel form types were employed, including jars, bowls, and beakers. Weinstein
( 1991 :Table 7-1) notes a tendency for the Goose Creek wares
to be slightly thicker than the grog-tempered vessels. Unfortunately, little information is provided on the contents of
each vessel batch or section.
Ricklis's (1994) analysis of ceramics from the Mitchell
Ridge site (41GV66) is similarly instructive. Nearly 25,000
sherds were recovered from the site, the largest single-site
sample on the Upper Texas Coast (Ricklis 1994: 176). Ricklis
( 1994: 181) states that "few" reconstructions of sizable vessel sections are available. However, the entire assemblage
was sorted into vessel groups, and while no precise number
is stated, a general idea can be determined from the results
presented.
A sample of rim sherds representing up to 158 vessels
from the "Block Excavation" area were large enough for orifice diameter estimations. These ranged between 6 and 36
cm, with most between 12 and 27 cm (Ricklis 1994: 188, Figure
7 .9). Like the Lido Harbor data, these results agree well with
those from 41HR33. Of the 199 rim sherds from the entire site
on which vessel orifice determinations were made, half (n=99)
were untempered sandy paste. The remainder (n=lOO) were
grog tempered although most had a sandy paste and would
be classified by Weinstein (1991) within the San Jacinto type

247

series (Ricklis 1994:191, Figure 7.12). Elsewhere Ricklis
(1994:213, Table 7.8) reports the "total vessel count" for the
various areas of the site as 450 vessels. Grog-tempered wares
accounted for 159 (35.3 percent) of these, again mainly sandy
paste. Untempered Goose Creek ceramics comprised 58.2
percent (n=262) of the total and included small amounts of
Incised and Red-filmed types. The remaining "Other" category (n=29, 6.4 percent) was primarily bone-tempered ceramics, although a few (n=3) central Texas coast Rockport
Black-on-Gray vessels were also recovered. Virtually all vessel shapes appeared to be variants of simple jars and bowls
(Ricklis 1994:182).
The most complete discussion of a large partial vessel
collection is Howard's (1990) analysis of 68 sections from
the Peggy Lake sites. Sixty-two (91.2 percent) were from the
Worthington site (41HR124), a large midden similar in many
respects to 41HR33. The vast majority (n=65 or95.6percent)
were identified as Goose Creek types, including 19 decorated Goose Creek Incised vessels, 38 Goose Creek Plain,
and 8 indeterminate specimens. All three of the grog-tempered ceramics have sandy paste and would be classified
here as San Jacinto: two Incised and one Plain (Howard
1990:241 ). The completeness of each vessel section is similar to that seen at 41HR33, most representing less than 25
percent of the whole pot. Only three rim-to-base profiles
were available. All of the 41HR33 vessel sets would fall within
Howard's (1990:239) criteria or definition of a vessel section
as a reconstruction sufficient to "provide information on the
form of the parent vessel's orifice, rim orientation, and/or
body form."
Howard ( 1990:241-250) measured as many of the following attributes as possible on each vessel section: orifice
diameter, rim orientation, lip form, decoration, temper, thickness, exterior surface finish, base form, volume, and evidence of use. Basic vessel forms (vases, bowls, and dishes)
were determined using diameter/height ratios. As previously
noted, the 41HR33 analysis was modeled in many respects
on Howard's Peggy Lake study, and therefore the results of
the two studies can be compared in some detail.
Howard ( 1990:243) notes that orifice diameter is difficult
to determine precisely but that the Peggy Lake vessels ranged
between 10 arid 35 cm with three frequency peaks: 12-15 cm,
22-23 cm, and 28-29 cm. These results agree well with those
from 41HR33 and the Lido Harbor (Weinstein 1991) and
Mitchell Ridge (Ricklis 1994) sites as well. At the DowCleaver and Shy Pond sites (Aten 1971; Hamilton 1988) similar peaks at between 15 and 20 cm and 25 to 30 cm were
noted.
Several other points of agreement are also evident between the Peggy Lake and 41HR33 vessel attributes. Lip
form varies considerably in both assemblages. Even variation (e.g., flattened to rounded) across the same vessel is
not uncommon. Howard (1990:245) reports a relatively high
frequency of lip notching at Peggy Lake: 52 percent of the
decorated vessel sections but only 28 percent of the

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

248

nondecorated vessels are notched or scalloped. She notes
that at the Dow-Cleaver site (Aten 1971) lip notching appears to be restricted to later periods but that the significance of this attribute is unknown (cf. Ricklis 1994). Similar
base forms are found in both the Peggy Lake and 41HR33
collections (vessels and loose sherd collections), although
the former may have a somewhat higher percentage of conical bases.
Analytical efforts at the Peggy Lake sites also focused
primarily on the vessel collection. All loose sherds were
identified as to type and vessel part (rim, near-rim, body, and
base), but individual measurements were not made (Howard
1990:254-260). It was noted, however, that approximately 25
percent of the sherd collection consisted of "crumbs" (< 1
cm in maximum dimension), which compares favorably to
the 31.5 percent combined total of 5- and 10-mm categories
from TARL investigations at 41HR121 (see Table 30). The
latter however falls well short of the estimated 50 percent
crumb content at the Redtail (41HR581) site (Howard
1990:260). The degree to which these percentages were affected by different collection strategies, such as various
screen sizes, is not emphasized in the Peggy Lake report.
The disparate field recovery methods used at 41HR33
and 41HR121 largely preclude such comparisons and was
one of the reasons that individual sherd measurements were
not made on the Neyland collection specimens although
they are as a group clearly much larger than those recovered
from 41HR121. This in part reflects the relative volumes of
the sites and the percentage of each exposed or excavated
as well. Nevertheless, the density oflarger sherds(> 25 cm)
is likely very low at41HR121, regardless offield technique.
Sherd type percentages at Peggy Lake (Howard
1990:Table 59) reflect the multicomponent nature of the
Worthington (41HR124) andRedtail (41HR581) sites. Of the
total of 6,868 sherds analyzed, 71 percent (n=4,891) were
sandy paste and 4 percent (n=269) were grog-tempered sandy
paste. Contorted sandy paste (n=6) and grog-tempered silty
clay paste wares(Defined here and by Weinstein (1991) as
San Jacinto and Baytown series, respectively) (n=l 1) each
represent less than 1% while untyped crumbs (n= 1691) comprised the final 25%. By comparison, the 41HR33 and
41HR121 collections have little orno grog-tempered ceramics associated with the main site components and appear to
represent fairly well-constrained occupations restricted
mainly to the latter half of the Clear Lake period and perhaps
the Mayes Island period. Like the Peggy Lake analysis
(Howard 1990: 254) loose sherds in the 41HR33 collection
that refit were counted as one sherd.
CONCLUSIONS

Pottery from the project area analyzed in this study included collections made over 40 years ago by W. B. Neyland
as well as sherds gathered in the course ofTARL field work
in 1997 and 1998. It would be difficult to overstate the impor-

tance of the Neyland ceramic collection from 41HR33. This
is a representative assemblage of Goose Creek vessels and
sherds that is probably not replicable today.
This study concludes that no major revision of Aten's
(1979, 1983) typology of ceramics for the Upper Texas Coast
is indicated based on the data gathered on whole vessels or
decorated sherds. His classification is a satisfactory tool for
chronological studies, at least until significant new information comes to light that indicates need for revision. There is,
however, an operational difficulty in using Aten's typology
for sherds.
Most types of pottery vessels in the Upper Texas Coast
display decoration only on or near the rim, yet Aten included decoration techniques and motifs in his type definitions. Multiple types in this scheme share paste and temper
characteristics and cannot be distinguished on the basis of
body sherds (which far outnumber rim sherds in any collection).
In this study, we applied a modified version of Aten's
typology along lines suggested by Weinstein (1991). In his
revised typology, threeÂ·broad classes or "series" are recognized as (1) untempered, sandy-paste Goose Creek ceramics, (2) grog-tempered, sandy-paste San Jacinto series, and
(3) grog-tempered, silty-paste Baytown ceramics. Here, we
referred to all undecorated body sherds as "untyped" members of Weinstein's series (i.e. Goose Creek untyped, Baytown
untyped, and San Jacinto untyped). If undecorated rims
were present, the classification, "Plain" was employed (i.e.
Goose Creek Plain, etc.), or if the rims were decorated, the
classifications, Baytown Incised or San Jacinto Incised were
used. It is to be emphasized that this approach is not proposed as a revision of the Aten or Weinstein typologies. It
was simply employed in this study to facilitate classifying
and reporting the ceramic data.
Nonetheless, a system defining unequivocal types
based on body sherds should become a priority of future
studies in the area. Paste and temper characteristics should
become the primary defining attributes with decoration relegated to establishment of subtypes.
Forty vessels were identified in the Neyland collection
from 41HR33 (38 classifiable as Goose Creek, 1 as San Jacinto
Incised and 1 as Baytown Incised). Of 1447 sherds, the
majority were classified as Goose Creek Plain or Goose Creek
untyped. A few could be identified as Goose Creek var.
Anahuac, undecorated Tchefuncte, or O'Neal Plain var.
Conway. In his collection from 41HRI04 were found 4 sherds
of Goose Creek untyped and 1 sherd of Baytown untyped.
No vessels could be reconstructed from the 333 sherds
collected by TARL at 41HR121. The sherds were classified
as Goose Creek untyped (318), Goose Creek Incised (1),
Goose Creek var. Anahuac (1), Mandeville Plain (2), and
O'Neal Plain var. Conway (11 ). There were also 3 sherds of
Goose Creek untyped from 41HR577 and, from 41HR685, 1
sherd each of Goose Creek untyped, Baytown untyped, and
San Jacinto untyped.

Appendix D: Ceramic Analysis

249

Only the samples from 41HR33 and 41HR121 are sufficiently large and consistent to be used in chronological interpretation. In both cases, the predominance of plain or
untyped Goose Creek ceramics indicates late Clear Lake or
early Mayes Island occupations. Dates in radiocarbon years
for these are: Clear Lake, A.O. 100 to 425; Mayes Island, A.o.
425 to 650. Calibrated dates are earlier (200 B.C. to A.D. 100 for
Clear Lake and A.O. 100 to 300 for Mayes Island). This regional chronology is based largely on radiocarbon dating of
Rangia shells and no entirely satisfactory resolution to the
problems associated with dates on brackish water mollusks
has been devised.

Beyond their usefulness as chronological tools, the
ceramics from this project combined with those from other
sites in the vicinity of Galveston Bay and the entire Upper
Texas Coast constitute a valuable data base for the study of
pottery-related behavior. Data potentially useful in assessing vessel function, production, breakage, repair, and disposal were noticed in the course of this study. Information
of this kind is valuable to studies of ceramic use by huntergatherers, an issue worthy of concerted investigation locally as well as universally.

Appendix E: Modified Bone and Shell Artifacts

INTRODUCTION
In addition to ceramic and lithic assemblages, several
artifacts of modified bone, antler, and shell were recovered
along Buffalo Bayou. This appendix details the analysis of
the modified bone and antler recovered from 41HR33 and a
possible shell knife from 41HR121. No such artifacts were
recovered at any of the other sites investigated.
The analyzed material presented here consists only
those items identified by the fauna! analyst as "modified" or
which were previously identified by Neyland as bone tools.
While in the process of crosschecking the fauna! data, other
possible tools and manufacturing debris were noted within
the fauna! assemblage. No unique specimens, or tool types
not already identified during the course of this study, were
noted. It is likely that more intensive analyses of the bone
assemblage from 41HR33 would yield additional tools and
evidence of manufacturing.

MODIFIEDBONEANDANTLERARTIFACTS
Modified bone and antler specimens (N=31) were recovered only from site 41HR33 (Table 32). These specimens were
collected from excavations by Neyland 1 between 1957 and
1959 (Table 33). Unless otherwise noted, all bone is white- Â·
tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). The various types of
bone and antler tools are tabulated and described below.

Ulna Tools
A deer ulna tool (Figure 71a) measuring 122.5 mm in
overall length was recovered from 41HR33. The proximal
end of this specimen remains unmodified, while the distal
end (which has been snapped) has been sharpened to a
point. The curved humeral articular surface offers an ideal
grip for one's index finger, while the ridge just opposite the
grip has been nicked repeatedly with a sharp instrument
presumably to provide "traction" for the thumb grip. These
nicks extend onto the snapped distal fragment.
A second ulna tool (Figure 71 b) measuring 94.9 mm in
overall length, also from 41HR33, has a shorter, pointed distal end. This specimen lacks noticeable cut marks along the
upper spine of the tool, but cut marks along both ventral
faces of the distal tip suggest that the point was manufactured with the groove and snap method rather than by grinding the end to a point.
Another deer ulna fragment, Specimen 3, also recovered from 41HR33, appears to be the snapped tip from a
larger ulna tool. It measures 30.4 mm in overall length. The
tip is somewhat spatulate, although it has been ground to a
slight point.
In addition, a photograph of the recovered artifacts from
41HR33 taken by Neyland in 1957 shows another ulna tool
with a rounded, spatulate tip. This specimen was not found
in the current collection.

Aten et al. (1976:40) note that ulna tools with well-formed
points have been ethnographically reported as basketry awls.
Similar tools with spatulate ends are supposed flint-knapping
implements. The pointed tip of the first tool may indicate its
use as a basketry awl, while the second spatulate tip may
have snapped from a larger knapping tool.
Bone Projectile Points

Six artifacts from 41 HR33 have been identified as bone
projectile points based on the description of similar artifacts
recovered by Aten et al. (1976), Aten (1983), and Gadus and
Howard (1990). The first is a socketed bone point (Figure
71c), measuring 109.6 mm, which was fashioned from a juvenile deer metapodial. The shaft was cut and ground to a fine
point, while the articular end was snapped off. An incised
cut mark at the articular end indicates the initial attempt to
"groove and snap" this end. In addition, the cancellous tissue was reamed from the interior of the bone, and asphalt is
still adhering to the interior of the socket.
Four other specimens (Specimens 5-8) manufactured
from the thick-walled bone of a large mammal (presumably
deer) also have been determined to be bone projectile points
(Figures 7ld-f). They range in size from 40.5 mm to 67.3 mm
in overall length. Aten (1983) and Gadus and Howard (1990)
have identified similar specimens simply as bone projectile
points. This may also be the case for the three specimens
reported here. However, the proximal ends of each specimen
bear no sign of modification other than their snap from the
remainder of the bone. The distal ends of each specimen
were cut and ground to a point similar to the socketed bone
point described above. In their current state, these specimens appear _to be unsocketed bone projectile points, however it should be noted that they might also be the distal tips
of broken socketed bone projectiles.
The final specimen (Figure 71g) is another socketed
bone point that was fashioned from a deer phalange. A socket

has been cut at the proximal end, while the distal tip is ground
to a blunt point. This specimen measures 31.4 mm in overall
length. Like the other socketed bone point, this specimen
was hollowed out and has a trace of asphalt adhering to the
interior of the socket. Aten (1983:263) reports similar specimens at several coastal sites and correlates this type of blunt
point to those used by the Lake Charles Atakapa in the early
nineteenth century (Dyer 1917:5). He notes that arrows used
to kill birds were blunt in order to prevent blood from staining the feathers, which were in demand as a trade item.

Bone Awls

Twelve specimens have been categorized as bone awls
of various types. Nine of them have distal ends that were
sharpened to a point by cutting and grinding (e.g., Figure
7lh). Seven of these (Specimens 10-16) have been categorized as splinter aw ls based on morphological similarities described by Aten et al. (1976:40). All seven are sharpened splinters of thick-walled mammal bone. They range in length from
27.1 to 85.3 mm, although, with two exceptions, it is unclear

Morgan '.s' Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

256

whether they retain their original length or are simply the
snapped distal tips of longer implements. The first exception
(Specimen 15) has been sharpened at the distal end and intentionally cut at the proximal end to form a tool measuring 38.5
mm in length. The second (Figure 71i) is a bipointed specimen
that was originally thought to be two snapped tips. However,
in photographs taken by Neyland, the two pieces were shown
fitted together into a bipointed awl. This refitted specimen
measures 85.3 mm in overall length.
The remaining two pointed awls are considerably larger
than the eight previously described specimens. The first
(Specimen 17) is a split fragment of a large mammal long
bone that was sharpened to a point at one end. The opposite end retains ajagged fracture. The pointed distal end has
become somewhat blunted apparently from use. This specimen measures 89.9 mm in length. The second specimen
(Specimen 18) is manufactured from a juvenile deer
metapodial and bears a strong resemblance to a socketed
bone point, although the articular end has not been removed
to form a socket. Instead, the unfused epiphyseal surface
was left in place, while the distal end was cut and snapped to
a point. This distal end shows evidence of considerable
wear from use. This specimen measures 124.9 mm in overall
length. The exact function of both of these tools is uncertain, although it appears that both served as a punch or awl
of some type.
The other three "awls" exhibit a blunt, spatulate distal tip
(e.g., Figure 71j). Like the majority of the pointed specimens,
all of the spatulate specimens appear to be the broken tips of
longer implements. All have been ground to form their blunt
tips. These artifacts range in overall length from 22.6 mm to
52.0 mm. As noted above, Aten et al. (1976:40) distinguish
between ulna tools utilized in basketry manufacture and spatulate ulna tools used in flintknapping. The 12 awl tools in the
41HR33 collection probably served similar functions in addition to numerous other "punching" functions.
Compound Fishhook Barb
One specimen (Figure 71k) has tentatively been labeled
as the barb of a compound fishhook based on morphological
characteristics similar to those reported by Gadus and Howard
(1990:304) and Aten et al. (1976:36). The specimen is manufactured from the thick-walled bone of a large mammal and measures 30.1 mm in overall length. The distal end has been ground
to a point, while the proximal end has been beveled for attachment to a hook shank. This implement could also be a bone
awl and is only labeled as a fishhook barb based on similarities to the specimens reported above.
Antler
Two antler tine fragments were recovered from 41HR33.
The first (Specimen 23) is only the distal tip of a tine that
measures 15 .2 mm in overall length. The tip of this specimen

shows significant wear (blunted and indented). The second
(Specimen 24) measures 121.2 mm in overall length and exhibits only minimal wear on the tip. The type of wear on both
artifacts is suggestive of their use as flaking tools. Aten et
al. (1976) andAten (1983) note similar tools at 41CH46 and
41 CH98. Gadus and Howard (1990) also note 16 similar specimens from the Peggy Lake sites.
Bone Tool Fragments
Four artifacts from 41HR33 are bone tool fragments.
They all bear signs of modification, yet appear to be only
fragments of tools. Two of the specimens are splinters of
thick-walled mammal bone. One (Specimen 23) exhibits cut
marks at one end, while the other (Specimen 26) is noticeably burned with evidence of rodent gnawing. These may
have been bone awls whose distal tips have snapped off.
Another (Specimen 27) is a split long-bone fragment from a
deer. The broken lateral edges have been ground smooth
along approximately one-half of the artifact. The grinding
terminates at a fracture at the working end where the tip has
snapped. This tool was also probably an awl of some type.
The final specimen (Specimen 28) is a rib fragment from a
large mammal that exhibits minor grinding along the lateral
edges. Both the proximal and distal ends have snapped leaving only a medial fragment.
Bone Tool Manufacture Refuse
Two modified bone specimens are categorized as bone
tool manufacturing refuse. The first (Specimen 29) is the
metapodial articulation from a deer that has been cut or
grooved around the epiphyseal region and then snapped
from the bone shaft. Aten et al. (1976:41) note that the removal of the metapodial articulation is a step in the manufacture of socketed bone points.
The second specimen (Specimen 30) is a fragment of a
deer long-bone shaft. Each end of this specimen bears evidence of the groove and snap method necessary for the
removal of sections needed in tool production (Aten
1983:263).
Site 41HR33 may represent a locus of bone tool industry (see Appendix G), although this is not supported by the
identification of only two pieces of manufacturing debris. If
such an industry was indeed present here, one would expect
to find substantial amounts of bone debris from tool manufacturing. A cursory reassessment of the faunal assemblage,
however, suggests that a considerable amount of bone may
in fact be manufacturing debris. Because the objectives of
this analysis were limited to characterizing the Neyland collection material rather than performing a detailed functional
and/or typological analysis, and since this study was limited to those items identified by the faunal analyst (or
Neyland) as possible bone tools, a more-detailed analyses
was not undertaken.

Appendix F: Historic Artifacts

INTRODUCTION
In addition to artifacts of aboriginal origin, the artifact
assemblages from sites 41HR577, 41HR685, and 41HR121/
576 also contain numerous historic and modern artifacts.
For the most part, the modern (e.g., recent) artifacts at all
three sites can be attributed to wave-deposited flotsam that
washed ashore and amassed over time as well as occasional
modern refuse directly discarded on the site surfaces. Obviously modern trash was not collected and is not discussed
in this report. All materials from 41HR577 and 41HR685 were
recovered from disturbed, secondary contexts. In the latter
case, several artifacts possibly related to the late-nineteenthcentury occupations of Atkinson Island were recovered.
The relationship between prehistoric site 4lHR121 and
multicomponent historic site 41HR576 is discussed in detail
in Chapter 7 and is only briefly reviewed here. Site 41HR576
covers nearly the entire property owned by the Coastal Industrial Water Authority and the right-of-way maintained
by Houston Power and Light on the upper terrace along the
southeastern (right) bank of Buffalo Bayou. It is a multicomponent site with potential archeological remains dating from
the earliest Euroamerican occupation of the project area.
Prehistoric site 41HR121 is a buried, intact Rangia shell
midden covering a much smaller area. A portion of site
41HR576 overlaps but is (except in one small deflated area)
stratigraphically separated from the more deeply buried site
41HR121 shell lens, although a few small artifacts from each
cultural deposit have been subsequently displaced. Nevertheless, in those areas where the prehistoric and historic site
components overlap (or could potentially overlap) recovered artifacts were assigned to site 41HR121 in the field and
only later in the laboratory grouped as 41HR121/576. Artifacts from 41HR121/576 were nearly all recovered on the
surface or in the upper 10 to 15 cm of the deposits. Only
artifacts from Shovel Probe 13, over 50 m east-northeast of
the site 41HR121 deposits, were labeled solely as 41HR576.
Nonetheless, all historic materials from this general locality
are understood to be associated with the latter site designation. The recovered artifacts from 41HR121/576 represent a
sample of the material on the surface and nearly all of those
from subsurface contexts. For example, only a subsample of
small corroded metal fragments and the like was collected.
The recovered historic artifact assemblage at 4lHR121/
576 seems to represent primarily (if not exclusively) two different time periods. Earlier artifacts represent what appears
to be late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century picnicking
along the then-scenic banks of Buffalo Bayou (Heartfield,
Price and Greene, Inc. 1986), probably by visitors to the San
Jacinto Battlefield. Later, repeated episodes of dumping in
the mid-twentieth century by the San Jacinto Inn and restaurant, which operated between 1927 and 1967 (Butcher
n.d., cited in Hoyt et al. 1998:77) is evidenced by a considerable quantity of hotelware, condiment bottles, metal cans,
and other food service related detritus. No artifacts directly

261

attributable to other postulated historic components or occupations of 41HR576 have been identified.
Recovery data for all sites are presented in Table 34.
Provenience for all items is shown on Tables 35 and 36.
ARTIFACTS RECOVERED
Glass
The technology represented in the recovered glass assemblages is a primary diagnostic factor in determining the
chronological time frames of historic activities that occurred
at the sites. Before 1870, most glass bottles and jars were
produced in a variety of colors ranging from amber, aqua,
brown, and olive-green, because these colors were the naturally occurring products of the glass-making process (Lorrain
1968; Polak 1997). However, with the advent of processed
food, food packers began to demand clear glass. Glass manufacturers then began adding manganese or delenium to molten glass in order bleach out the natural colors, a practice
most common in bottle production between 1880 and 1914
(Polak 1997:26). Because this type of decolorization was
unstable, exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet rays) quickly
turned the glass purple. Munsey (1970:55) notes that by
1915, the supply of manganese to U.S. glass houses was cut
off and by 1918, the last of the bottles and jars made with
this technique should have reached consumers. Polak
(1997:26) further notes that glass produced between 1914
and 1930 is most likely to change to an amber or straw color.
In addition to glass color, other temporally diagnostic features such as mold seams, neck finishing, and closures
(Lorrain 1968; Polak 1997) provide insight into the temporal
span of activities at the sites.
A total of 826 glass artifacts was recovered during the
1997 survey project and from subsequent testing of 41HR121
and 41HR576 in 1998. The vast majority (n=821) are fragments from an assortment of bottles, as well as drinking
glasses, ashtrays, and other containers. Four complete
bottles make up the remainder of the glass artifacts. The
recovered glass is categorized by color in the following discussion. Fragment counts and diagnostic features such as
maker's marks and label embossing are noted and, discussed
within each color grouping in their respective categories.
Amber Glass
A total of 93 amber glass fragments was recovered from
41HR121/576. All appear to be bottle fragments, the majority
of which are presumably liquor or beer bottles. Three embossed fragments were noted within the collection. One bears
the lettering "ONE PINT' which attests to the liquor bottle
presumption, while the other two have a more intricate "flowery" or "swirled" design. Most of the specimens have the
appearance of modern beer bottle fragments.
Three amber glass fragments were also recovered from

An aqua glass bottle stopper (Figure 73) was collected
from 41HR685. According to Polak (1997:24), this type of
bottle closure was utilized between 1850 and 1900; consistent with the pre-1900 usage of the site inferred from archival
and cartographic evidence (see Chapter 6).

41HR685. One appears rather recent while the remaining two
are moderately water-worn, having frosted surfaces and
rounded edges commonly seen on "sea-glass" found on
modem-day beaches.

Ninety-nine green to dark green glass fragments were
recovered from 41HR121/576. The majority of these are wine
bottle fragments. This is evidenced by several bottle bases
with high, molded 'push-ups' with convex knobs at the centers, a feature commonly associated with wine or champagne
bottles (Switzer 1974:23). Moore (41HR576 TARL site file;
Heartfield, Price and Greene 1986) attributes the presence of
large numbers of such bottles to late-nineteenth- and earlytwentieth-century picnicking, presumably associated with
San Jacinto Day celebrations.
Other lighter green glass fragments are likely from other
food or beverage bottles. In particular, a complete bottle of
emerald green glass (Figure 74) was recovered from the site
in addition to numerous fragments of the same bottle type. It
is tall, slender, and octagonal-sided with a mold seam running the full length of the bottle and over the lip, indicating
a post-1900 date. An identical bottle is listed by Cleveland
( 1996) as a Green Capers (Pepper) bottle although no date is
given. In addition, the base of the bottle bears a maker's
mark of a capital "R" enclosed within a triangle. Toulouse
(1971:432) indicates thatthe Reed Glass Company of Rochester, New York utilized this mark between 1927 and 1956.
This evidence supports the argument for mid-twentieth-century dumping at the site by the San Jacinto Inn (1927-1967).
One dark green or emerald glass fragment was also recovered from 41HR685. Like most of the other glass fragments from the site, it is water-worn indicating that its original breakage may have been elsewhere, and it was secondarily deposited at the site.
Amethyst Glass

Aqua Glass
Two nondescript aqua glass fragments were recovered
from 41HR121/576. Both are bottle fragments. Aqua glass
was commonly produced until the 1930s (Polak 1997:488).
Because this date slightly overlaps with the time period of
the nearby San Jacinto Inn (1927-1967), it is not possible to
confidently assign these fragments to the earlier or later
usage of the site.
A third aqua-tinted fragment was also recovered from
41HR576 on the terrace margin just downstream from
41HR121. The letters "OWN" in yellow painted lettering as
well as the shape of the fragment suggest that this is a portion of a Royal Crown soda bottle. Soda bottles with painted
lettering postdate 1940 (Polak 1997). This specimen probably represents restaurant or twentieth-century picnicking
discard.

Ninety-nine fragments of amethyst (purple) glass were
recovered from 41HR121/576. All of the fragments appear to
be from a single bottle. They were recovered in the first two
levels of single 50-cm square quadrant in excavation unit
N149/E109, near the small gully that appears to have been
the main locus of San Jacinto Inn dumping activities. The
entire sample is distinctly homogeneous with regard to color,
thickness, and embossing. The bottle neck has a broad sloping tooled collar with a beveled ring. Mold seams along the
neck extend only to this ring indicating a manufacturing
date roughly between 1880 and 1890 (Polak 1997:20). The
base of the bottle bears an embossed "3," while several
panel fragments are embossed with various pieces of the
words "BAR" and "KENTUCKY." Although this bottle did
not directly match others in the reference publications used
in this study, similar bottle styles and lettering are identified

facture for the recovered brick fragments, they are clearly
secondary deposits washed ashore by wave action at
4 IHR685. The fragments at 4 IHR12 l/576 are probably associated with San Jacinto Inn dumping activities. All bricks
that were complete enough to allow determinations were
machine-made or wire cut, suggesting that they date no earlier than at least the latter part of the nineteenth century and
more likely postdate World War I. The advanced corrosion
(or erosion) of many of the fragments precludes a determination of whether they are hand-struck or machine cut bricks.

A total 894.7 g of corroded metal was collected from
41HR121/576. Most of this is nondescript, corroded small
metal fragments. In addition, two cocktail forks and a spoon
were collected from the site. In 1959, Neyland collected another spoon and an identical cocktail fork at 41HR121 when
he originally defined the site. This is one of the strongest
assurances that TARL did indeed relocate an upslope extension of what Neyland defined as 41HR121 (seeChapter7). In
addition, 146.2 g of corroded metal fragments were recovered from 4 IHR685, as were9.3 g from41HR577.

Utensils
The cocktail forks recovered by Neyland and the TARL
survey are identical (Figure 79a). All three are slender, three
pronged forks with the outer two prongs flaring outward. A
maker's mark on the back reads "JMO. McCLELLAN &CO."
Ney land also collected a spoon from 41HR121 (Figure
79b ), the handle of which has two lines running from the
basin to the end, culminating in a scroll-like design. The
tarnished surface suggests that it may be silver plated. Marks
on the back include a small banner with "LS. CO.," another
banner with "TRIPLE PLATE," and finally in larger letters,
"SAN JACINTO INN," which re-affirms the connection of the
site with the nearby restaurant. A second spoon, recovered
upslope at 41HR121/576, is a lower-quality model with a lessornate handle. The untarnished plating of this specimen is
flaking off at several spots. "AVON PLATE" is stamped on
the back of the handle.

time rather than individually as might be the case for picnicking. It is likely that many of the unidentified metal fragments reported below are also crown cap fragments that are
too corroded and incomplete to classify.

Nails
Two corroded nails were recovered from 41HR121/576.
The first is a large round spike weighing 193 .2 g. The second
is a small wire nail fragment weighing .8 g. Another larger
wire nail weighing 7.8 g was collected at41HR685. Nelson
(1968) notes that wire nails became widespread as the preferred nail type after 1890.
Metal Fragments
The bulk of all recovered metal artifacts from 41HR121/
576 consists of small, unidentifiable, corroded fragments
weighing 554.5 g. Many are probably fragments of crown
caps. In addition, numerous metal can rims are present within
the sample. Most, if not all, of these fragments are considered to be associated with the restaurant dumping activity.
A few larger pieces may be fragments of metal trash cans or
lids. At least two were noted on the surface.
A total of 146.2 g of corroded metal was collected at
4 IHR685. Unlike the fragments at41HR121/576, most of which
were small pieces, the metal from 4 IHR685 is rather globular.
In addition, numerous small bivalve shells have become aggregated within the corroded globules. This suggests that
these pieces were at one time within the channel where they
corroded within the marine sediment, encapsulating particles
within the corrosion. Their original shape is unknown.
The four small heavily corroded fragments from 41HR577
weigh 9.3 g. Their original nature is indiscernible.
Recent Metal
Recovered recent metal artifacts from 41HR121/576 include three fragments of modern aluminum foil, an aluminum
can pull-tab, and an aluminum twist-off bottle cap. A Brillo
pad was also recovered from this site. Whether this is morerecent debris or is associated with restaurant dumping is
unclear.

Bottle Caps
OTHERHISTORICANDMODERNARTIFACl'S
A minimum of 78 rusted crown caps (bottle caps) were
recovered from 41HR121/576. As mentioned above, the crown
cap was invented in 1897, revolutionizing the soda and beer
bottling industry (Polak 1997:24). This type of closure is
further datable by the type of lining used on the interior of
the cap. However, due to the advanced corrosion of the
recovered specimens, no examples of the lining were recovered. Nonetheless, it appears that the caps are associated
with the restaurant dumping since most of them are confined to distinct quadrants within certain units. This distinct
clustering suggests that they were discarded at the same

A small sample of miscellaneous artifacts that do not fit
into the above categories is described below. These include
a shell button, shell casings, coal slag, slate, a light bulb,
and modern plastic items.

Button
One two-holed, common shell button measuring 19.9
mm in diameter was recovered from 41HR121/576. Meissner
( 1995: 125) notes that buttons larger than 1.6 cm are usually

coarser grained, possibly machine or industrial grade fuel
for heavy machinery or steamships.

Slate
One slate fragment weighing 4.3 g was collected from
41HR685. Its edges are waterworn.

Light Bulb
Neyland collected a tubular light bulb from the surface
of 41HR121. It measures 13.77 cm in overall length, and the
diameter of the tube is 2.0 cm. The interior filament is comprised of a thicker wire with four small metal balls spaced
evenly along its length. This thick wire runs along one side
of the interior, curves at the tip, and from there, a thin wire
runs back toward the base. Small sections of the same wire
connect the metal balls on the thick wire to the thin wire. At
the base, both wires enter a glass insulator with the numbers
"92" on one side and the letters "BO" with a line over each
letter on the other.
Modem Plastic
Forty-two fragments of modern plastic were collected
from 41HR121/576. Five of the specimens are red fragments
of Tabasco sauce bottle lids. The remaining 37 specimens
are all polypropylene pellets that apparently have been
washed ashore by wave action. These pellets are the "raw"
form in which the plastic is transported prior to being melted
and molded.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Numerous diagnostic fragments in the recovered historic artifact assemblages aid in delineating periods of historic activities at the various sites. Distinguishing glass coloration, bottle mold seams, distinctive embossing, and
maker's marks enable the numerous glass fragments and the
four complete bottles to serve as temporal indicators. At site
41HR121/576, amethyst-colored glass and mold seams on
the numerous fragments of a whiskey bottle delineate an
earlier usage of the site toward the end of the nineteenth
century (1880-1890), while clear glass fragments embossed
with time-specific lettering, as well as clearly modem serving vessel fragments are indicative of later twentieth century dumping by the San Jacinto Inn. An aqua glass bottle
stopper from 41 HR685 indicates pre-1900 usage of the site,
while clear glass fragments and a distinctive maker's mark
suggest post-World War II casual usage of the island or
environs. All artifacts from 41HR685 were recovered in recent deposits. These specimens, however, appear to be sec-

ondary deposits that have washed ashore. Finally, a clear
glass specimen from 41HR577 is suggestive of a modem
date at this site.
The numerous ceramic fragments recovered also help
to date the activities at the sites. Most importantly, the 100+
sherds of ironstone hotel ware with distinctive makers' marks
clearly indicate mid-twentieth-century dumping at 41HR121/
576. Most, if not all, of the recovered brick fragments from
the various sites are machine made indicating that they were
made no earlier than the late-nineteenth century at the earliest, while the salt-glazed sherds of stoneware from 41HR121/
576 are noted to have died out at the beginning of the twentieth century.
While the abundant metal fragments possess few diagnostic qualities, the identifiable crown caps (bottle caps)
within the assemblage indicate a minimum date at the site of
1897. However, the distinct clustering of the crown caps at
41HR121/576 suggests that these specimens represent restaurant discards dating to post-1927. In addition, the metal
serving utensils (spoons and cocktail forks) are also indicative of restaurant activities.
While many of the artifacts are temporal indicators on
their own, it is clearly their association with restaurant activities that ties them to a precise historic period. Clearly, the
multitude of hotelware fragments, which also date to the
1927-1967 period of San Jacinto Inn operation, are associated with restaurant dumping as are the numerous condiment and alcoholic beverage bottles and other glass serving
vessels. Their definite link to the San Jacinto Inn restaurant
in particular is secured by the recovered spoon stamped
with the lettering "SAN JACINTO INN." While this spoon was
recovered from 41HR121 in the 1950s, it should be noted
that it was probably recovered somewhat downslope from
the TARL41HR121/576 site area. Along with asherd of the
same Shenango China ironstone hotelware also recovered
by Neyland at 41HR121, this suggests some downslope
movement of the dump materials located at 41 HR121/576.
Numerous pieces of modem plastic, recent metal fragments (aluminum), and many modern glass fragments appear
to have been deposited on the various sites by wave and
wind action. Aside from these modem (recent) specimens, the
remaining artifacts are indicative of two time periods. The first
is the late-nineteenth century wherein apparent casual, recreational use of site 41HR121/576 occurred. Later in the midtwentieth century, the small gully at 41HR121/576 served as a
garbage dump for the San Jacinto Inn Restaurant. Historic
artifacts at 41 HR685 and 41 HR577 may indicate direct usage
of these sites as well, although all of the artifacts recovered
from these sites were in secondary deposits. At 41HR685,
some temporally diagnostic artifacts may relate to the latenineteenth-century shipyard or contemporaneous occupations of Morgans Point/Atkinson Island.

INTRODUCTION
This appendix details the analysis of the vertebrate faunalremainsrecoveredfromsites41HR33, 41HR.104,41HR577,
41HR685, and 41HR121. The material from 41HR.33 and
41HR104, as well as a small amount from 41HR.121, is from
the Neyland collection. The remainder was recovered during the 1997-1998 TARL investigations. Also included in the
41HR121 analysis is the documentation of abundant crab
claws that appear to be debris from the historic San Jacinto
Inn Restaurant dumped in close proximity to the site. Bone
fragments were identified by macroscopic comparison to a
reference collection of modem, local fauna.

mestic pig. The elements consist mostly of foot bones along
with some other edible parts of the pig. Only 10 percent of
the bones had been burned to a noticeable extent.

41HR577
The recovered bones from this site consist of only a
few unidentifiable fragments, some of which are the size of a
deer, plus two birds (Table 38). One is the shaft of a femur of
a young bird and is comparable to a 4-pound domestic
chicken. Without either end, the identification cannot be
made. The other is a left humerus of a rock dove [a.k.a. domestic pigeon] (Columba livia). However, it is in the size
range of the passenger pigeon and could possibly be such.

41HR33
41HR685
The faunal assemblage from this site includes modified
bone artifacts (see Appendix E) as well as bones that did not
show modification (Table 37). Some of the deer bones had
been subjected to the "groove and snap" method of tool
production as indicated by the discarded end pieces. Other
bones are in similar condition but do not exhibit the grooving marks. There are many ends oflong bones in the collection and many fragments of shafts of the same. Spiral fractures are common. It appears that one of this site's functions
was that of a bone tool industry locality. There do not seem
to be as many unidentifiable fragments as is usual at the
other local sites (e.g., Zimmerman 1990). Perhaps Neyland
was particular as to what bones he retained. The possible
"recent burial" at this site was the remains of a young do-

These bones are probably all from domestic cow (Bos
taurus) (Table 39).

41HR121
Much of the material from this site is historic (most
likely debris from the restaurant) (Tables 40 and 41 ). Indicative of this is the presence of the ends of chicken feet and
wings, which are usually discarded before cooking the chickens, as well as crab claw debris. Fish, chicken, and deer are
about equally represented in the assemblage. A recovered
horse tooth from the site may be a fossil.

APPENDIX H: OBSERVATIONS ON SELECTED THIN SECTION SAMPLES
by Paul Goldberg, Department of Archaeology, Boston University

Page intentionally left blank.

Appendix H: Observations on Selected Thin Section Samples

INTRODUCTION
Seventeen intact sediment samples were collected by
TARL from two sampling columns and one possible feature
at 41HR121 near the mouth of Buffalo Bayou in upper
Galveston Bay, Texas, during the spring of 1998. Of these, 10
were analyzed using micromorphology (Table 42).
The aim of the micromorphological analysis was twofold: to evaluate the integrity of cultural deposits, particularly the presence of remains of burning (e.g., calcareous
ashes, charcoal) and to assess the amount of secondary
(i.e., postdepositional) effects present, such as bioturbation,
downslope movement, and traces of pedogenesis (soil formation). The technique ofmicromorphology is ideally suited
for such tasks, as it uses petrographic thin sections prepared from undisturbed blocks of sediment collected from
the excavation. The unexcavated blocks were carefully
packed and sent to the Micromorphology Laboratory at
Boston University, where they were oven-dried for several
days at about 60Â° C. They were then impregnated under
vacuum with unpromoted polyester resin diluted with styrene at a ratio of 7:3. After several days the samples were
placed in a 60Â° Coven overnight. The hardened blocks were
then cut into 50-x-75-x-20-mm slices and submitted to Spectrum Petrographics, Oregon, where they were processed into
thin sections; owing to the dense, clayey nature of many of
the samples, some had to be reimpregnated during their fabrication. The finished thin sections were then studied in
transmitted (plane-polarized and cross-polarized) and reflected light using binocular and petrographic microscopes
at magnifications ranging from 20X to 400X. Descriptive terminology follows that of Bullock et al. (1985) and Courty et
al.(1989).
MICROMORPHOLOGICALOBSERVATIONS
Miscellaneous Sample
Sample SM-1 (possible feature in Test Unit 1 within
and beneath shell zone): This sediment essentially looks like
sediment from the Beaumont Formation that has been biologically mixed with organic-rich clay. It is the opposite of
sample 2-A-4, which is composed mostly Beaumont sediment but which exhibits some domains of organic-rich clay.
In addition, part of the darker color of this sediment is due to
the incorporation of finely divided charcoal into the matrix.
The microstructure is illustrated by centimeter-sized
loosely aggregated material. Very thin (ca. 5 Âµm) reddish
brown clay coatings are found locally around the aggregates and in patches on the shell fragments, the former indicating that the biological activity ceased before the translocation of the clay took place. Calcareous nodules generally
have sharp edges and are typically iron/manganese stained,
suggesting that they have been transported and were not
formed in situ. Similarly, one weathered, sand-sized, iron/

307

manganese-stained bone fragment was observed. No traces
of calcareous ashes could be found in the slide.
SMColumnl
Sample 1-B-1 (0-10 cm): This is generally a ''tight" sample
with little intrapedal porosity, although on a larger scale it
exhibits a crumbly to subangular blocky microstructure.
Overall the sample consists of quartz sand and silt in a dark
brown, organic clayey matrix. 1Wo millimeter-sized shreds of
dark brown charcoal represent the only large-scale pieces of
this material. Many irregular sand-sized inclusions of bright
orange-red organic matter are present, denoting recent roots
or organic matter; these are well incorporated into the matrix
by bioturbation. The darker color is enhanced in part by the
presence of fine silt-sized charcoal or organic matter that is
incorporated into the matrix. The deposit is noncalcareous,
and therefore any remains of calcareous ashes would have
been destroyed by dissolution.
Sample 1-B-2 (12-20 cm): This is essentially identical to
Sample 1-B-l but with greater number (ca. 10 percent) of
isolated domains oflighter (Beaumont Formation) material
mixed within predominantly darker, organic-rich silty clay. A
few well-rounded reddish brown, millimeter-sized iron pisolites are present. Fewer remains of bright orange-red modern
vegetal material are present, reflecting a greater depth of this
sample. Overall, the sample appears to exhibit greater
bioturbation than the overlying unit, and this is reflected in
the rounded nature of many of the peds and more of a coarse
crumbly and less subangular blocky structure than above.
The inclusions of the Beaumont Formation have marked
speckled and granostriated b-fabrics, whereas the bulk of
the material has a very weakly dev~loped b-fabric that is
mostly concealed by the abundance of fine organic matter.
This material is also noncalcareous.
Sample 1-B-3a (22-33 cm; upper part): The same general components as found in the overlying samples can be
observed here, but the proportions are different. For one,
the ratio of lighter, speckled yellow to darker (organic matter
rich) matrix here is higher, reflecting the proximity to the
Beaumont substrate. This change is also mirrored in the
relative increase in rounded iron pisolites and the presence
of the remains of one coarse-sand-sized crumbly carbonate
concretion. This sample does contain a single, slightly
rounded, centimeter-sized iron-stained bone fragment and
the remains of a poorly preserved tooth (mostly enamel),
both reflecting the proximity of this layer to the underlying
Rangia shell lens.
Extensive bioturbation is clear in this sample as well,
with much mixing of the darker and lighter matrix components. The structure is subangular blocky, but within many
peds it is possible to observe some remains of rounded biological passage features (likely earthworms). Because of the
increase in the amount of yellow material, the overall
granostriated nature of the matrix is more apparent, even

within the darker, organic rich portions. In fact, some of the
lighter-colored domains exhibit incipient reticulated b-fabrics, suggestive of some minor shrink swell activity (stress
cutans).
Although the overall organic content of this sample is
lower, cultural inputs in the form of bone, are clearly higher.
No ashes were observed again because of the noncalcareous
nature of the material.
Sample 1-B-3b (22-33 cm; basal part): The lower part of
this sample exhibits even a greater proportion of lighter material, and individual elongated passage features filled with
darker material are quite visible; a very slight increase in the
number of iron pisolites is present, as well as some modem
roots. The matrix here is more organized, and reticulated bfabrics are better developed as are granostriated b-fabrics,
particularly around some of the pisolites. Both of these suggest a greater amount of soil movement, probably related to
shrink-swell. Such clay orientation could be the internal expression of the "clay films" observed in the field, although
no translocated clay was observed in most of the sediments.
Interestingly, this lower part of Sample l-B-3 did not contain
any culturally related features (e.g., bone) as was the case
for the upper part of the sample. It also seems to have a
greater amount of recent roots than the overlying part.
Sample 1-B-4 (35-39 cm): This sample is generally simi-

lar to Sample 2-A-4 from the Beaumont Formation and is
composed oflight yellow clay with inclusions of fine quartz
sand and some quartz silt. In contrast. however, the matrix is
much less calcareous than is the case with fresh Beaumont
Formation, thus reflecting some effects of decalcification
associated with pedogenesis. Nodules have a more-weathered, dissolved appearance than in fresh Beaumont material.
SMColumn2

Overall, the samples from Column 2 are very similar to
those from Column 1, showing the same trend from darker,
organic-rich sandy silty clay at the top, to lighter-colored
fine sandy and silty clay at the base.
Sample 2-B-1 (0-5 cm): This sample is quite similar to
Sample l -B-1 but contains a higher proportion of matrix material. This matrix material takes the form of finely comrninuted modem reddish brown organic matter that has been
well worked into the matrix by biological mixing, probably by
earthworms; modem roots are also present, and in some
cases have been partially ingested by mites as evidenced by
the presence of small pellets. The matrix also exhibits small,
irregularly distributed millimeter-sized domains oflighter silty
and sandy clay that display more prominent speckled bfabrics. These are areas of Beaumont Formation that have

Appendix H: Observations on Selected Thin Section Samples

been worked upward into the matrix by biological activity.
Iron pisolites are rare and less than a millimeter in size. The
sediment is noncalcareous.
Sample 2-B-2 (5-17 cm): As in Sample 2-B-1, this is
slightly redder and richer in fresh organic matter than its
upslope counterpart, Sample l-B-2. However, there is an
overall decrease in this reddish material, and the sediments
are much more similar to Sample l-B-2. Biological mixing is
also marked as above, and individual earthworm casts are
visible. Iron pisolites are slightly larger and more abundant
than in Sample 2-B-l, but they are generally rare. Lightercolored domains of the Beaumont Formation are not apparent, and much of the matrix is dark yellow brown organicrich clay. It is noncalcareous.
Sample 2-B-3 (17-27 cm): This sample appears to have
been partially disturbed during collection, and only patches
of weathered shell and clumps of matrix are visible. Noteworthy is the presence of numerous shell fragments-all
undergoing dissolution-and an altered, > 1-cm-sized ironstained bone fragment; iron pisolites remain rare. In addition, the proportion of lighter-colored clayier domains of the
Beaumont Formation increase markedly. These domains are
commonly coarse sand sized and intimately mixed with similar sized organic-rich ones by earthworm activity. The weathered nature and partial dissolution of the shells would indicate that finer-grained calcareous components, such as ash,
would not likely be preserved in this deposit, even if originally present.
Sample 2-B-4 (27-37 cm): This sample is similar to that
of Sample l-B-4, but the matrix here is somewhat less decalcified, and vague patches of calcareous clay can still be
observed. This sample does exhibit a greater amount of
circular, millimeter-sized passage features filled with darker
brown, organic-rich matrix material, suggesting a marginally deeper effect of biological mixing. Iron pisolites and
calcareous nodules are more numerous here, reflecting the
greater proximity to the Beaumont source. The nodules are
typically well rounded with sharp edges, indicating that
they are derived. Even though the matrix is still locally
calcareous (pedogenesis has not removed all the fine carbonate from the sample), no ashes were observed in the
sample.
Sample 2-A-4 (Beaumont Formation): This sample consists of yellow, calcareous clay with inclusions of fine quartz
sand and some quartz silt. It contains some iron pisolites
that vary in size from a few millimeters up to ca. 11 mm and
several (approximately 5 percent) well-rounded sand-sized
carbonate nodules, which judging from their rounded nature look to be derived and not formed in place.

309

The matrix has a speckled birefringence fabric (b-fabric)
but is locally reticulated and granostriated, suggesting some
degree of soil turbation. Localized within the matrix are domains-both circular and irregular shaped-in which clay
and organic matter are more abundant. These areas appear
to be a result ofbioturbation and mixing of overlying material. There do not seem to be many other signs of
postdepositional activity, such as clay translocation or precipitation of secondary carbonates. In fact, to judge by the
rounded nature of most of the microcrystalline calcite as
well as the sand-sized calcareous lithoclasts, it appears that
carbonate is being dissolved.

SUMMARY
In summary, the micromorphological analyses of these
sediments show that the two sampling columns are quite
similar. However, some local, minor differences are apparent
in the upper part, particularly in Column 2, which is richer in
fine-grained, macerated root material worked into the matrix.
It would not be surprising if more roots occurred at the surface near this profile. Both profiles show the same general
trends from top to bottom. Organic-rich sandy silty clays
occur in the upper samples and with depth become successively poorer in organic matter and richer in the clayier components of the Beaumont Formation, which occurs at the
base of the profile. Concomitantly, the sediments are enriched in iron pisolites, which occur in the Beaumont Formation. The lowest part of each profile shows essentially weathered Beaumont sediments, which have been partially decalcified, including both dissolution of carbonate nodules as
well as microcrystalline calcite of the matrix.
The vertical trends appear to be the result of strong
bioturbation, most1y by earthworms, which have extensively
reworked the upper organic materials with the organic-poor
Beaumont Formation. The fact that the upper three samples
are noncalcareous (presumably having been decalcified
through pedogenesis) makes it likely that any remains of
calcitic ashes were destroyed. Other evidence of pedogenesis is represented by slight reorganization of the matrix in
the form of a weakly developed granostriated b-fabric suggesting slight shrink-swell. There is no evidence for any
downslope movement of the material nor any trace of primary bedding. These are likely to have been erased by
bioturbation in any case. The only traces of cultural remains
are found within the Rangia layers, where scarce remains of
bone fragments were found. In spite of the degree of
bioturbation, cultural materials do not seem to have moved
vertically within the profile nor downslope.

Appendix/: Phytolith and Diatom Analyses of Unit /40N/108E at 41HR121

INTRODUCTION
This appendix details the phytolith and diatom analyses undertaken in order to aid in the reconstruction of the
paleoenvironment of site 41HR121.

tained the highest proportion of biogenic silica; however,
even those samples contained much less than is typically
found in grassland soils. Vegetation in the immediate area
probably has been primarily shrubs/trees rather than grasses.
Diatoms

MATERIAI.SAND l'vlETIIODS
A total of eight samples from Unit N104/E108 at site
41HR121 was processed and examined microscopically for
biogenic silica, specifically diatoms and phytoliths. The processing technique of the eight samples consisted of placing
5 cc of the sample in a 1,000 ml beaker along with 50 ml of
Chlorox for a minimum of 48 hours to digest all organic matter. The sample was then diluted, stirred, and allowed to
settle overnight, at which time all supernatant above the
sediment was siphoned off. Sodium pyrophosphate (a
deflocculant) was then added to break up any clay lumps.
The samples were then sieved through a #70 (200-micron)
sieve to remove coarse material. After adding up to 1,000 ml
of water, stirring, and allowing to settle, the upper 500 ml of
water was siphoned off, taking with it clay-sized particles
held in suspension. This procedure was repeated 10 times to
remove all clay particles. Larger particles, including
phytoliths, settle to the bottom. After allowing to settle overnight, the sample was transferred to 50-ml test tubes, centrifuged, and the supernatant was then decanted and discarded.
Zinc bromide (5-7 ml) was added, and the samples were again
centrifuged. The specific gravity provided by the zinc bromide allows the biogenic silica to float while the elastic silica
sinks. The supernatant containing the biogenic fraction was
decanted into clean 50-ml test tubes. Distilled water was
then added to the biogenic silica fraction, reducing the specific gravity and allowing the biogenic silica to sink. The
samples were again centrifuged and decanted. After transferring the biogenic silica into a 15-ml test tube, 5-7 ml of
ethanol were added, at which time the sample was stirred,
centrifuged, and decanted. The sample was then transferred
to a small vial with ethanol, centrifuged, decanted, and left
to dry.
A small amount of the dry biogenic silica was placed on
a microscope slide. Three drops of Permount were added
and stirred together with the dry material. A cover slip was
then added and pressed to remove air bubbles and distribute the material. The slide was then placed on a low-heat hot
plate to drive off volatiles, force some Permount out from
under the cover slip, and spread it around the edges as a
sealant.

Because diatoms were scarce on the initial test slides,
an entire prepared slide of each sample was scanned at 200X
to search for diatoms or other distinctive biogenic silica.
Identifications were at 400X or l ,OOOX as needed. Table 43
shows the results of the diatom analysis. Environment and
habit are taken from Round et al. (1990) and Patrick and
Reimer (1966). If possible, diatoms were identified to the
species level; however, since Pinnularia and Eunotia are
overwhelmingly fresh genera and Amphora are brackish to
marine, they were not identified at the species level. Samples
290, 291, 292, and 272 had no diatoms on the two slides
examined. No sample had adequate numbers to support any
significant conclusions. Overall, the diatoms are brackish or
estuarine taxa that live attached to plants or other substrate
or live in or on the sediment. Almost all diatoms were degraded or broken.

Other Biogenic Silica
In addition to diatoms, the scans at 200X magnification
revealed a silicified cell that is either a hair base or a fruit cell,
probably from a dicot. It is abundant only in Sample 288 (27 cm below surface), although it was also found in Samples
307 and 308 from the Beaumont Formation. Samples of
nongrass plants growing near the site can also be processed
and examined as the potential source of this phytolith.
Sponge spicules and Palmae spheres were most closely
associated with the samples from the Beaumont Formation.
Both whole spicules and large pieces are included in this
count. Spicules are relatively common in estuarine sediments
(Fearn 1995). Both Serenoa (Saw palmetto) and Sabal (Cabbage palmetto) produce this type of phytolith typical of the
Arecaceae Family. Palmae spheres were not found in great
enough abundance to say they were common in the area. A
single Ebridian (Hermesinum adriatcum) was present in
Sample 308. This species inhabits warm water with salinities
from 10-16 ppt (Hargraves and Miller 1974 ). Silicified stellate
hairs were found in Samples 288 and 292. These characterize
some members of Malvaceae, Euphobiaceae, and Fagaceae;
but they may be found in other families as well.

Phytoliths
RESULTS
Biogenic silica recovery averaged less than 0.1 ml from
an original 5-ml sample(< 2 percent). Lots 288 and 290 con-

Grass-type phytoliths were counted on one slide from
each sample. Generally, a total of 200 phytoliths is sufficient to arrive at an accurate picture of the assemblage.

However, for most samples, 200 was unrealistic. Therefore,
six evenly spaced transects across each slide were counted
instead. On the two slides with abundant biogenic silica,
only two to three transects were necessary to exceed 200
phytoliths. Dumbbell fragments in final calculations were
divided by two to give an equivalence of whole dumbbells.
All percentages are based on the total number of grass
phytoliths that were counted, or that would have been
counted, in six transects on that slide. Percentages of other
biogenic silica counts taken from the entire slide are based
on this same sum, but they are not included in the sum
itself. This allows for easy comparison of the relative
amount of diatoms, for example, with grass phytoliths
across samples.
Dumbbell-shaped phytoliths are typical of Panicoid
grasses (Brown 1984; Mulholland 1989), while rondel-shaped
phytoliths typify Festucoid grasses and dominate marsh
samples (Fearn 1995). Figure 80 graphically represents the
proportions of biogenic silica. The grass phytolith assemblage resembles that of the poorly drained prairie in southwestern Louisiana; however, phytolith concentrations are
much lower than would be typical of a grassland. Coastal
marshes seem to be characterized by higher percentages of
rondel phytoliths and saddle shapes (usually from
Phragmites) than are present in these samples.

3

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In the five samples from the shell zones and from the
Beaumont Formation, the biogenic silica fraction is so low
that the percentages are not statistically significant. Notice
the steady increase in the percentage of irregular-shaped
phytoliths in the last five samples in Figure 80. These are
mostly degraded to the point that they are identifiable as
phytoliths, but their original shape is indiscernible. Pitting is
extreme in some of these samples, so that even buliform
cells, which are large and robust but unfortunately not identifiable to any useful level, were reduced to lacey pieces.
Samples 288, 290, and 291 had the greatest amount of biogenic silica, although levels are well below samples from the
Cajun Prairie of Louisiana (Fearn 1995). The dumbbell to
rondel ratio for the 4lHR121 samples ranges from 0.2 to 3 .4.
The percentages and ratios resemble those of soil samples
from southwestern Louisiana's poorly drained prairie around
the town of Mermentau (Fearn 1995).
Overall, diatoms were not found in great enough numbers in any of the samples to warrant additional analysis.
The identifiable phytoliths are probably coming mostly from
modem plants. The warm wet environment is conducive to
silica dissolution, so that older (deeper) horizons have little
identifiable material.

by Bruce M. Albert

Appendix J: Pollen Analysis of Sediments from 41HR121

INTRODUCTION
This appendix details the pollen analysis of eight samples
recovered from site 41HR121 in an attempt to reconstruct
the flora of the site at the time of its occupation.

MATERIALANDMEIHODS
Eight samples from 5-cm arbitrary levels of Unit NI 40/
E108 at 41HR121 were processed for pollen analysis and
subjected to light microscopic analyses (Table 44). Sample
sizes of ca. 5 cm3 were first immersed in a 400-ml deflocculant
solution of 5 percent sodium hexa-metaphosphate and distilled water for 48 hours. The deflocculated solution was
then coarse sieved through a 125-micron screen (removing
larger particles from the sample) and then mechanically filtrated through an 8-micron nylon screen (removing smaller
particles). The samples thus mechanically reduced to between 8 and 125 microns were then further reduced chemically via KOH, HCL, HF, acetic acid, and an acetolysis solution (of 90 percent acetic anhydride and 10 percent sulfuric
acid), cleaned with distilled water and ethanol, stained in
safranine and tertiary butyl alcohol, and finally embedded in
a 2,000-viscosity silicone oil matrix for purposes oflight microscopic analyses.
Light microscopic analyses were conducted at 400X
magnification for scanning purposes and at l ,OOOX for purposes of closer observation. The silicone oil matrix also allowed for the rotation of grains for purposes of the latter.
Most of the prepared samples were rich in irreducible charcoal microfragments and thus necessitated a relatively diffuse mounting of sample material onto slides to avoid the
potential obstruction or differential observation of smaller
pollen grains such as Salix.

IIBSULTS
Seven of the eight samples were either completely lacking in pollen or contained only an obviously degraded spectrum. In the case of the Beaumont sediment (Lot 308), the
sample was completely devoid of pollen. In the five cases
from the colluvial and shell layers (Lots 273, 290-292, and
301), only the most degradation-resistant grains of Pinus
and the Compositae (tubuliflora and Asteraceae) were preserved in concentrations of ca. 100 grains per cm3 (cf. Bryant
1992). Slightly higher concentrations of pollen (ca. 200 grains
per cm 3) were encountered in the case of the topsoil sample
(Lot 288), where still-recognizable cheno-am and gramineae
pollen was also encountered. Finally, relatively high concentrations of pollen (ca. 500 grains per cm 3) were encountered in the sample from the unconformity directly atop the
Beaumont (Lot 307). Fourteen pollen taxa were encountered
here (Table 45).
The sample from the Beaumont unconformity merits
special attention, as the variety of pollen encountered as

well as its relative concentration is suggestive of a
nondegraded spectrum of the flora from 41HR121 at the initial stages of its human occupation. The abundant appearance of intectate grains such as Quercus (rare to nonexistent in most archeological samples analyzed in the state; cf.
Bryant 1992 and Scott-Cummings 1994), the variety oftaxa
encountered, and the uniformly pristine quality of the pollen
exines are all suggestive of a highly viable spectrum of the
ancient vegetation. The detailed study of differential pollen
degradation of Bryant (1992) at the Justiceburg Reservoir
from modem surface samples and cultural layers at the site
of 41KT53 revealed that the presumably undegraded modern sprectra contained an average of 13.5 taxa per sample,
while the composite-, cheno-am-, and Pinus-dominated
sprectra from the cultural layers at 41 KT53 contained only

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

320

8.3 tax.a per sample, with only 20 percent of the relative pollen contration vis-a-vis the surface samples (based on average counts of ca. 200 grains). The surface samples from the
Justiceburg area were also considerably richer in identifiable pollen of the more delicate intectate grains of Quercus
and others. Thus the pollen taphonomical situation from the
41HR121 Beaumont unconformity is much like that from the
undegraded (modern) pollen spectra from the Justiceburg
Reservoir in terms of absolute taxonomical variety, relative
concentration, and the higher relative representation by less
degradation-resistant pollen grains.
ADDIDONALANALYSIS
Further laboratory and cursory microscopic analyses
(less than 50 grains counted per sample) from sediments at
41HR121 were conducted in order to test the initial positive
pollen analytic results. The initial laboratory results had suggested that a hydrological enrichment in the contact zone
above the semi-impermeable Beaumont clay layer had led to
both reduced oxidation and increased acidification. The sum
effect of these two factors seems to have been to reduce the
microbial and fungal activity that normally acts to consume
(via incremental ingestion) pollen under conditions of enhanced biological activity in the soil.
These physio-chemical factors are not significant in
themselves vis-a-vis pollen preservation (a point often lost
in discussions on the topic of pollen taphonomy). Rather,
they are significant only in that they serve to influence biological activity. Exceptionally, only more-extreme physical
and chemical conditions such as extreme heat (e.g., from
fire) or extremely high base levels (beyond those experienced in most soils) may in themselves serve to degrade
pollen grains.
Three samples were used, including further (residual)
sediment from the contact with the Beaumont initially analyzed (Lot 307), and two samples of similar sediments from
other exposures at or near the contact with the Beaumont.
As the clay formation subsumed under the "Beaumont" appellation may in fact be somewhat variable with respect to
permeability (variable on an extra-local scale?), and because
the undulations in this formation may lead to the "mini-basin-like" local accumulation of water in some places and not
in others (variable on a meter-to-meter scale?), it might be
expected that pollen preservation at the Beaumont contact
is not constant and continuous, even within the context of a
single archeological site.
Results of the further laboratory mechanical and chemical reduction of the residuals from the initial sample from Lot
307 ("Sample A") reproduced the initial results, suggesting
that the pollen reported from the first series had not originated as a result of contamination occurring during initial
laboratory procedures. To eliminate the possibility of contamination during the collection process in the field
(highly unlikely, as the recovered spectrum from Lot 307 did

not reflect the modern vegetation at the site), further samples
in close proximity to the Beaumont "contact zone" were processed in the laboratory and referred to as "Sample B" and
"SampleC."
Sample B contained abundant well-preserved pollen,
including ca. 50 percent Quercus pollen, much like the spectrum from Lot 307. Sample C contained much less pristine
pollen grains belonging largely to the more-degradationresistant (high sporopollenin content) pollen grains of
compositae tubuliflora tax.on. Some Quercus-like pollen found
in this latter sample was highly degraded. It seems as if the
thinner pollen walls of the intectate grains have undergone
proportionally more degradation here, most likely due to
microbial activity. It is possible that microtopographic (situation outside the contact "basin"?) or pedologic (higher
permeability?) factors have been responsible for the higher
level of pollen degradation in Sample C than in Sample A
and Sample B. However, positive finds from Sample B, with a
pollen spectrum similar to that found in Sample A, serve to
enhance confidence in the interpretation of initial pollen
analytical results unless both samples became contaminated
during collection in the field.
Conversely, finds of degraded Quercus-like pollen in
Sample C provide the exception that proves the rule, as the
differential degradation of weaker, thin-walled ("intectate")
pollen grains most likely implies that the pollen found here is
also ancient, rather than modern. Should contamination in
the field have been a pervasive problem (e.g., if pollen had
been transported by water permeating the soil at the site),
more pristine Quercus pollen should have been recovered
from Sample C. Rather, the spectrum from Sample C represents a mid-way point along the spectrum of pollen degradation experienced in the initial sample series from 41HRl21.
Deriving from a situation similar to that of the two positive
samples, Sample C serves to underline the potential for highly
localized pollen preservation in situations that are not always immediately apparent to the field archeologist.
The solution to this problem of sampling lies in the
perception of situations conducive to pollen preservation
and the extensive sampling of such soils. The palynological
results from 41HR121 suggest that one such situation relevant to Corps of Engineers archeological activity in the
Galveston area may be the contact zone with the Beaumont
Formation. Further alluvial pollen analyses from the Nueces
River Delta suggest that delta and bayou sites along the
Texas Gulf Coast also possess a high potential for producing a more-continuous Holocene vegetation historical sequence relevant not only to archeology, but also to climatic
and hydrologic history (Albert 1998).
RECONSTRUCTINGANCIENTFLORAFROMTIIE
BEAUMONTUNCONFORMITY AT41HR121
The spectrum from the Beaumont unconformity at
41HR121 is dominated by the tree pollen of oak, with an

Appendix J: Pollen Analysis of Sediments from 41HRl21

arboreal admixture of hickory and elm. Although the local
relative pollen productivity ("r-values") of these taxa remains to be determined, it is probable on the basis of
Anderson's European r-value studies that oak will be overrepresented vis-a-vis elm at a ratio of ca. 3-4: 1 (cf. Faegre et
al. 1989). Also, given the less-efficient airborne transport
of the large (ca. 50-micron) hickory pollen grains, it is probable that this taxon will be underrepresented, especially
given the low wind velocities of pollen within a woodland
setting (cf. Anderson 1974). Thus, the seemingly overwhelming domination of the tree pollen spectrum by oak
might be quite misleading. After the low relative pollen
representation of hickory and elm are taken into account,
these latter taxa might comprise perhaps 20-25 percent of
the ancient oak-hickory woodland.
In addition, considerable variation in the morphology
of the oak pollen was encountered, some grains being spheroid and having slight equatorial constrictions of the colpus
membrane, some grains being more lenticular without such
equatorial constrictions. The former Quercus grains also tend
to be larger (ca. 30 microns), while the latter grains tend to
have smaller dimensions (ca. 20-25 microns). It is possible
that this bi-modal variation in the oak pollen morphology at
41HR121 is reflective of a certain specific variety of oak trees
comprising the ancient vegetation. By way of contrast, oak
pollen from the lower Nueces River valley in south Texas
exhibited almost no variation from the uni-modal, "spheroid" type described above (Albert 1998). It is likely on the
basis of comparative pollen samples that the latter correspond to (but are not exclusively identifiable with) the pollen of Quercus virginiana or live oak, a species that today is
by far the most important amongst oaks on the south and
central Texas coasts becoming less important northward
along the Texas Intercoastal Waterway. Within the riparian
woodlands of the Upper Texas Coast, a far greater variety of
oak species is encountered, some, such as white oak, exhibiting a greater moisture tolerance. It is possible that the bimodal morphology of the Quercus grains encountered from
the layer above the Beaumont unconformity at 41HR121 reflects just such a riparian arboreal admixture.
Below the riparian woodland canopy, a number of small
tree or shrub taxa grew, including members of the genus
Celtis (hackberry), Prunus (which includes species such as
black cherry), Prosopis, and Salix. Salix grains probably
originated from considerable stands growing at the low watermark by the drainage adjacent to 41HR121 at the time of
its early human occupation. Given the poor relative pollen
production of Salix (Jim Innes, personal communication
1994), it is likely that the 14 grains ofthis taxon encountered
reflect its local fluorescence. Likewise, the pollen of Prosopis
is poorly distributed, thus the local growth of mesquite on
the clay soils around 41HR121 is also indicated from Archaic times.
The herbaceous vegetation at 41HR121 is relatively
weakly represented, given the "typical" dominance of open

321

landscape taxa in samples taken from archeological sites
(especially those of an agrarian character, cf. Dimbleby 1985
and Bryant and Holloway 1983). It may be that either the
hunter-gatherer-fishers at 41HR121 had affected little disturbance of the local vegetation or that the pollen spectrum
from the Beaumont unconformity predates their arrival onto
the site. Amongst the herbal flora, a combination of grasses,
sedges, and composites predominates. Most unlike the pollen spectra from the lower Nueces River valley, there is practically no pollen of the highly anemophilous and productive
cheno-am group. While sites from the area regularly registered 20-80 percent cheno-am pollen from the environs of
the present-day Salicomia salt marshes, almost no halophytic vegetation is indicated in what appears to be a purely
estuarine rather than coastal floral environment at 41HR121.
The isolated appearance of Lotus (a rare type) is also suggestive of fresh-water conditions adjacent to 41HR121 at
the initial period of its occupation.
A further comment remains to be made regarding Pinus
representation. Given the tendency of pollen of pine to be
highly overrepresented, sometimes even over long distances
(Faegri et al. 1989), it is likely that this component reflects
long distance transport of Pinus pollen from the East Texas
piney woods. By way of comparison, up to 10 percent Pinus
pollen was encountered in some sediments from the Ricon
Bayou in South Texas, hundreds of kilometers from the
present-day location of that biome (Albert 1998). It is thus
unlikely that the "mere" 8.4 percent Pinus pollen registered
at 41HR121 reflects its local presence.
Finally, to what extent does the spectrum recovered from
41HR121 reflect regional vs. local conditions? Given the
modem analogues of the dynamics of pollen recruitment
onto terrestrial deposits at archeological sites as modeled
by Jacobsen and Bradshaw (1981), the likelihood is that an
extralocal limit of a maximally 500-m radius served as a point
of origin for most of the pollen counted (sans Pinus). Given
also the low wind velocities encountered on forest floors
(Anderson 1974), it is furthermore likely that perhaps 90 percent of the nonpine pollen counted originated from less than
100 m. Thus the areal extent of the Archaic oak-hickory forest was most probably limited to the riparian bottoms and
the slope above 41HR121. It is possible that a more open
vegetation existed in the interfluves beyond.
CONCLUSIONS
A minimum limiting date for the establishment of the
oak-hickory (riparian?) woodland has been established prior
to the initial stages of human occupation at 41HR121. Archaic inhabitants at that site would have encountered a relatively rich woodland environment with a considerable variety of economic plants such as oak acorns, hickory nuts,
mesquite beans, and perhaps even wild cherries (Prunus)
and sunflower seeds (Asteraceae). The herbaceous flora is
furthermore reflective of an estuarine rather than a halo-

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

322

phytic setting for this "coastal" site. In fact, the riparian
flora encountered by the prehistoric folk at 41HR121 would
be much like that encountered at sites far inland within the
oak-hickory woodland zone.
Although modest in scale, the analyses from 4 lHRl 21
are important in that they have produced the first viable
prehistoric pollen spectrum so far recovered from an archeological site from the entire western Gulf coastal region. Given
the poor conditions of pollen preservation encountered at
most shell midden sites, the grain-sized soil chemical analyses from the same site will be of great interest in indentifying
the hydrological and soil chemical conditions responsible

for the pristine preservation of pollen from the Beaumont
unconformity (see Chapter 7). Palynological sampling at future shell midden excavations could then be improved considerably. Further inroads into the regional natural history
of the Upper Texas Coast might also be made through exploratory cores into deltaic and estuarine marsh sediments
(see Albert 1998). Within the Galveston Bay region, higher
rates of sediment deposition (up to 1 m per century after
Harry Williams, personal communication 1997) and the resultant lateral dislocation of accreting deltaic fronts might
require multiple cores in order to ensure the retrieval of a
complete Holocene sequence.

by Mervin Kontrovitz

Page intentionally left blank.

Appendix K: Ostracode Study of Samples from 41HRl21

INTRODUCTION
This appendix details the ostracode analysis of samples
from site 41HR121. Ostracodes are aquatic crustaceans with
calcium carbonate (calcite) shells that are commonly preserved in ancient sediment. Different ostracode taxa inhabit
different environments and are therefore useful in interpreting ecological factors from old sediments. They have been
useful in reconstructing environmental history, including
such factors as temperature, turbidity, salinity, other dissolved materials; and water depth (Kaesler 1983).

MATERIALANDMETIIODS
Eight bagged samples from 41HR121 were received in the
micropaleontology laboratory at Northeast Louisiana University. Each sample was removed from its plastic bag and soaked
in tap water for 24 hours at room temperature (Kontrovitz et al.
1991). Then, each sample was gently washed with tap water
through a U.S. Standard 120-mesh sieve.

325

The portion retained in the sieve was air dried and examined in detail for ostracode shells; this process is called
"picking" and involves spreading the dried sediment on a
small tray so that no grains overlap. Each grain on the tray is
examined under a stereo-microscope using an appropriate
magnification, here lOX. Any specimens of interest are removed with a wet #00 red sable brush and placed on a standard paper micropaleontology slide for further examination
and identification.
RFSULTS

No ostracodes were recovered from any of the eight
samples (Table 46). It is unfortunate because the microscopic
crustaceans are extremely useful in paleoenvironmental interpretation as has been demonstrated by many researchers
including Kontrovitz et al. (1995) and Kontrovitz et al. (1997).
Due to the lack of ostracodes from 4 lHRl 21, a reconstruction of the site's paleoenvironment utilizing the crustaceans
was not possible.

This appendix tabulates the proveniences, counts, and
weights of shell recovered during the TARL investigations
of 41HR121and41HR576 as well as counts of shell specimens contained in the Neyland collection from 41HR33. The
former consist primarily of Rangia cuneata shells, which for
the 41HR121/576 sample have been tabulated separately from
the oyster (Crassostrea virginica) remains. Separate tables
are provided for TARL probes and test excavation units. In
addition, the proveniences of three land snail specimens
recovered during the TARL excavations are given.
The analysis of Rangia shell recovered during TARL
testing of 41HR121/576 focused on determining the number
and weight of shell. All recovered Rangia shell was initially
separated into one of four categories: left umbos, right urnbos, indeterminate or broken urnbos, and fragmented shell
lacking umbos. Specimens in each category were then
counted and weighed using a digital scale to 0.1 g (Tables 47
and 48). The simple counts in any category may be referred
to as the number of individual (or identified) specimens
(NISP). Minimum number of individuals (MNI) was determined for each provenience in the following manner. First,
the higher number of either left or right umbos was taken as
a base value. After subtracting the difference between left
and right umbos from the number of indeterminate or unknown umbo specimens, the remainder (if any) was divided
by two and rounded to the next whole number. This procedure allowed for the possible representation of a single clam
by two umbos (one of which might be indeterminate). For
provenience subdivisions in which only fragments were recovered, MNI calculations were somewhat more problematic. If umbo specimens were recovered in the same level in
adjacent quadrats, then the fragments were not counted (as
one MNI) because of the possibility that they might have
originated from fragmentation of the same specimen. This
tends to reduce the calculated total MNI. However, in cases
where varying numbers ofleft vs. right urnbos were encountered in different quadrats within a single excavation unit,
no attempt was made to link the MNI estimates (i.e., each
provenience was calculated separately). While this may have
increased the MNI estimation slightly, it is almost certainly
offset by the treatment of the unknown umbos and fragments described above. In any case, the MNI values on
Tables 47 and 48 should be considered estimates.
Several factors influence MNI and weight measurements. Chief among these are the degree of fragmentation
and sampling/recovery biases. Fragmentation of shell may
result from burning or heating, groundwater dissolution or
leaching, and/or mechanic~l fracture before, during, or after
burial. Mechanical fracture can be caused by prehistoric
breakage, soil movement, or excavation and screening procedures. For example, choice of screen size, dry versus wet
screening, or simply the effort expended to recover small
pieces of fragmented shell all affect MNI and weight measurements and the relationship between them. For example,
shell weights are somewhat biased toward whole or rela-

329

tively intact shell fragments due to the difficulty of recovering very small or friable shell. This is especially true for the
shovel tests and probes from 41HR121/576 (see Table 47)
where the sediment was dryscreened through either 1/4inch (6 mm) or 1/8-inch (3 mm) wire mesh. Shell recovered
during later TARL test excavations is probably more representative, especially for proveniences for which fine-screen
(1/16-inch or 1.5 mm) samples were processed. Some degree
of fragmentation and shell loss during excavation, transport, and water screening can be expected for almost any
archeological excavation or screening technique.
In any case, fragmented shell is probably overrepresented in all archeological assemblages due to mechanical
breakage during excavation or screening. Such effects reduce the whole shell numbers and weights while increasing
the fragmented quantities. On the other hand, fragmented
shell can also be expected to be somewhat underrepresented
due to the difficulty of recovering small pieces manually
from the screen.
The relationship(s) between MNI and NISP (both of
which are discrete count variables) and weight (a continuous measurement variable) are important issues in the analysis of both vertebrate and invertebrate faunal samples from
archeological contexts (e.g., Grayson 1984; Mason et al.
1998;Lyman 1979, 1994).ArecentreviewofMNivs. weight
counts as employed in California shell midden studies (Mason et al. 1998) identified several potential factors influencing the choice Of one method versus the otherÂ¥dncluding
taxonomic abundance and preservation (i.e., accurate representation) within and between individual taxa%as well as
the resulting analytical effects and biases. In instances such
as that at41HR121, where taxonomic abundance is reduced
nearly to a single species (Rangia cuneata, with only minor
amounts of oyster shell), both approaches may be appropriate depending on the questions asked and bearing in mind
the caveats already mentioned regarding shell fragmentation and recovery bias. The potential of significant lateral
variability within individual shell middens (or even depositional facies within those middens) must also be recognized
and appreciated in any interpretation of shell count or weight
data (e.g., Claassen 1991; Stein 1992).
Other than counts, weights, and MNI determinations,
analysis of Rangia shell from 41HR121/576 has been minimal.
Seasonality estimates based on Rangia growth patterns (Aten
1981; Carlson 1988) are commonly performed on archeological shell assemblages from the Upper Texas Coast. However,
a number of researchers have reported discrepancies between
the calculated seasonality estimates and known collection
dates of modem samples or have questioned the uniformity
of spring-summer readings in Galveston Bay archeological
assemblages (e.g., Patterson and Gardner 1993; Patterson et
al. 1991; Weinstein and Whelan 1987; but see also Ricklis
1990 for the results of both modem and archeological samples
on the central coast). In addition, reviews of the methods of
various shellfish seasonality studies, including Rangia growth

patterns, have demonstrated the complexity and limitations of
making accurate determinations (e.g., Claassen 1993; Monks
1981; Pallant 1990; Rollins et al. 1990). Given the importance of
seasonality estimates for understanding aboriginal subsistence/settlement patterns and the utilization of estuarine resources, resolving such questions regarding the validity of
Aten's technique has been identified as a primary research
objective in the recently completed Historic Preservation Plan
for the Houston-Galveston Navigation Channel project area
(Kibler et al. 1996). A COE-sponsored reevaluation of Rangia
seasonality is cutrently being conducted by Aten on multiple
modem samples collected at known times of the year. Pending
the outcome of this study and in light of the prevailing uncertainty, determining the seasonality of Rangia specimens from
41HR121 was postponed, at least temporarily. Nevertheless,
with the exception of the shell samples submitted for radiocarbon dating, all of the shell recovered during the TARL investigations has been curated in anticipation of more-detailed
analyses in the future should they be necessary.
Some determination of the amount and degree of burning of the shell from41HR121 was also attempted, but this is
a more complicated endeavor than it may at first appear to
be. Localized concentrations of burned shell are often identified as potential hearth areas in Upper Texas Coast shellbearing sites, especially in light of the paucity of other evidence such as charcoal concentrations or burned, discolored sediment (e.g., Aten 1983; Howard et al. 1991). However, there does not appear to be any generally accepted,
quantifiable, unambiguous criteria for determining even the
presence or absence, much less degree, of burning in Rangia
shell assemblages from the Upper Texas Coast. Burning has
been defined or may be indicated by one or more of the
following (alone or in combination): a grayish discoloration
over all or part of the shell surface, increased degree of shell
fragmentation or breakdown, or surficial characteristics such
a "powdery" or "chalky" feel or appearance. For example,
Kirkham and Ensor ( 1998:B-8) recently defined burning as
"a dark gray color over most of its [the shell's] surface that
appeared to penetrate beneath the surface (i.e., the discoloration was not just a topical smudge)" while unburned shell
"appeared mostly white or had discolorations from the soil."
Others (Howard et al. 1990: 321; see also Howard et al. 1991 :25)
have attempted to quantify such estimates of burning by
using criteria such as "a continuous dark gray discoloration
over 50% or more of the shell or fragment," but they note
that weathered shells often exhibit a mottled gray discoloration as well. In many archeological reports, the criteria by
which burned shells are identified is either assumed or not
precisely defined (e.g., Weinstein 1991). While the
identificaiton of burned shells in these reports may very well
be accurate, there is little or no compelling evidence either
for or against such data (and the inferences and interpretations that necessarily rely on them) beyond confidence in
the analyst's ability or experience in recognizing evidence of
burning. In some cases, the criteria selected are intention-

335

ally restrictive (i.e., they intentionally underrepresent burning) in an attempt to accurately define hearth areas or other
localized concentrations ofheavily burned shell (e.g., Howard
etal.1990).
Replicative experiments on burned shell are reported in
Ambler(1973) andAten (1983). Ambler (1973: I 12) notes that
shell can be fragmented principally in two or three ways:
mechanical breakage (presumably during the process of extracting the meat), leaching, and heating. Ambler's shell burning experiments demonstrated that "exposure to the direct
heat of fire causes Rangia shell to crack, spall, and disintegrate, and that only a portion of the fragments thus produced retain definitive evidence of burning" (1973:112).
Leaching may also contribute to shell weakening to the point
where "any slight pressure or movement will result in breakage" (Ambler 1973:112). Aten (1983:38) also reports that
"fresh Rangia shell brought into contact or close proximity
with the hot coals of a fire can, depending on the intensity of
contact, totally reduce a shell to a handful of charred fragments in less than 5 minutes." Ambler ( 1973: 112) concludes
that "unless a shell is weakened by fire or leaching, it is
unlikely to break by mechanical means alone." Deliberate
attempts to break fresh shell by "stomping" resulted only in
minor chipping. While Dillehay (1975) did note a trail of
crushed shell between the excavation and screening areas
at 41 CH32, these were presumably archeological shells that
may have been previously exposed to either cultural heating
and/or postdepositional leaching. The degree of traffic and
modern materials (rubber tires and heavy-soled boots) may
also be additional complicating factors. Ambler (1973: 112)
does note that burned shell acquires a gray appearance, but
he does not elaborate further.
Aten (1983:38) concludes that the observed rapidity of
shell fracturing and charring supports the assumption that
hearth areas should be marked by high concentrations of
burned shell fragments, even though there may be little or
no trace of charcoal or baked, discolored sediment. He also
suggests that small baked clay balls may be the accidental
byproducts of burning and that their co-occurrence with
burned shell probably indicates hearth areas (Aten 1983:58).
While these inferences are entirely reasonable and consistent with ethnohistoric observations (e.g., Dyer 1917 in
Newcomb 1961: 325) about the use of shell, perhaps for heat
reflection, they do not assist with the identification of less
intensive burning.
Despite these experimental observations, there do not
appear to be clear criteria or methods by which to identify
the presence or absence of heating except in certain cases
(e.g., intensive burning) and certainly no objective means of
determining degree of heating in any quantifiable (and replicable) way. More rigorous experimentation appears to be
necessary to derive quantifiable estimates of heating intensity and to discriminate between the effects ofleaching and
burning.
There would appear to be only a limited number of rea-

336

sons why shell would be found in appreciable quantities in
archeological deposits. While some may have been used as
either formal or expedient tools, nearly all of the Rangia
found on Upper Texas Coast archeological sites was clearly
used as a food resource. While not all collected shell may
have ultimately been used as food (e.g., Kirkham and Ensor
1998:B-10), most can be expected to have been heated to
some degree during the process of meat extraction, which is
most easily accomplished by gentle heating (Aten 1983:38).
However, more intensive burning can be expected to occur
under two conditions: first, as unintentional overheating
and second, where fires were built on existing shell deposits
(perhaps to take advantage of drier ground surfaces or better heat reflection, cf. Aten 1983). In the former case, it might
be expected that brittle, overheated shell might be set or cast
aside in a discrete discard pile. In the latter case, discrete
concentrations are also expected as are perhaps a greater
degree of fragmentation and more intensive burning. Existing shell mounds may also have been preferentially used for
habitation areas. Dyer (in Newcomb 1995:325) stated that
among the Lake Charles Atakapa, "shamans' huts and those
of headmen were placed on higher ground, often on the tops
of old shell and refuse heaps." Of course, these later occupations may also contribute to shell fragmentation, especially if the shell had been heated previously.
The relatively high degree of shell fragmentation evident at 41HR121 may be attributable to several factors, including increased cultural burning, groundwater dissolution and leaching, soil characteristics such as shrink/swell
potential, and excavation procedures, or any combination
thereof. The effects of postdepositional leaching may mimic
fragmentation caused by heating. The proximity of the
41HR121 shell lens to the contact of the impermeable Beaumont Formation interface, and the consequent increase in
groundwater throughflow, may have contributed to an increased degree of carbonic acid dissolution and a breakdown of calcium carbonate shell structure, but these should
be laterally continuous (or homogeneous) and not pointspecific effects like heating. It may also be difficult in some
cases to differentiate leaching from postdepositional breakdowns such as soil shrink/swell or animal burrowing. However, with the exception of burrows, postdepositional effects ought to be for the most part laterally (although perhaps not vertically) continuous. In sum, it may be difficult to
accurately determine precisely why a particular batch of shell
is greatly fragmented, although the probable factor(s) can
usually be identified. This is especially true in a single component, thin discrete shell midden deposit, such as at
41HR121.
Given the difficulties of assessing variability in coloration or surface characteristics and in light of the many ways
in which shells can be broken, it may be easier to identify the
absence of burning rather than its presence. Therefore, unlike the intentionally restrictive criteria for burning employed
in some studies (e.g., Howard et al. 1990), the approach taken

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

here was more inclusive and focused instead on attempting
to identify areas of less evidence of burning. The shell assemblage from 41HR121 exhibits a wide range of grayish
shading, ranging from nearly white to darkish gray. Nearly
all of the broken and fragmentary Rangia shell also appear
to be somewhat "powdery" or have "flaky" exterior surfaces. Overall the shell assemblage from 41HR121 can be
characterized as in moderate to poor condition. The overwhelming majority do not appear to have the same degree of
structural integrity as modern beach samples.
In light of the difficulties and time required for identifying evidence of burning (i.e, discoloration) on fragmentary
shellÂ¥.iand bearing in mind Ambler's ( 1973: 112) observation
that unburned (and unleached) shell is unlikely to
fragmentÂ¥.iall unidentified umbos and fragmented shell from
41HR121 were assumed to be burned. Kirkham and Ensor
( 1998 :B-10) also note that "thoroughly burned" shell rarely
appears as whole shell but rather as small fragments or umbos. Of course, fragments also may include unburned shell
broken during archeological recovery (excavation or screening) or by natural processes during or after burial. Emphasis
was instead placed on identifying shells that appeared to be
more than 90 percent complete, all of which could be identifiable in terms ofumbo direction. These shells are believed
to have either never been heated or were heated so little that
their structural integrity was not compromised, and they
were therefore able to survive the rigors of burial, possible
postdepositional leaching, and recovery. The degree of breakage (greater or less than 90 percent completeness) was used
as the sole criterion of burning in this studyÂ¥.ithe effects of
postdepositional leaching or other noncultural mechanical
breakage were assumed to be horizontally undifferentiated.
This method of identifying burned shell is, of course, equally
conservative in its own regard (but in the direction of underestimating burned shell). Many of the "whole" shells are
grayish colored to a greater or lesser extent or have exterior
surfaces that are flaky or "powdery."
Both the count and weight of "unburned" shell (as defined herein) are presented in Tables 47 and 48. The percent
weight of unburned shell to total shell weight is also given,
but only for total weights greater than 20 gin order to eliminate spuriously high values attributable to sampling. Fragmented shell as a percentage of total shell weight by provenience was also calculated. Obviously, in the case of the
shovel probes and tests, recovery was not always 100 percent. Investigatory emphasis of those tests was on presence/absence of shell, so there is clearly a bias toward whole
shells in Table 47. This is especially true for the Test Trench
A-SW-9 provenience from which only a portion of the shells
were selectively retained. The bias toward whole specimens
may be offset somewhat by the use of dry screening.
Unfortunately, the determination of burned vs. unburned
specimens occurred after samples from three proveniences
(Lots 51, 243, and 272) were submitted for radiocarbon analysis (see Chapter 7) and thereby destroyed. For these three

Appendix L: Invertebrate Fauna

proveniences then, reported results must be considered minimal estimates.
Finally, although allometric shell data from Upper Texas
Coast archeological sites have previously been used in the
calculation of meat weight estimates and associated correlates such as caloric measurements in person/days (e.g.,
Aten 1983; Dering and Ayers 1977; Dillehay 1975; Gadus
and Howard 1990; Weinstein and Whelan 1987), such calculations were not performed in this study. Not surprisingly
there are many approaches to making such inferences, such
as using MNI vs. shell weight as basal data, and none are
wholly satisfactory or incontrovertible (e.g., Claassen 1991;
Mason et al. 1998; Rollins et al. 1990: 472-473). The assumptions and methodologies used in making such calculations
are complex and many factors affect the age and/or size
classes of shell represented in archeological assemblages
(e.g., Ford 1989; Waselkov 1987). Given the degree of fragmentation and the limited number of whole shells on which
accurate measurements could be made, no attempt was made
to make meat weight estimates or determinations using the
existing 41HR121 Rangia shell assemblage. Furthermore,
shell size and meat weight were not central to current objectives of this study and, moreover, were complicated by the
relatively small, noncontiguous area of the site exposed during testing. However, all of the shell has been curated so
that the potential of such studies may be explored in the
future after more extensive excavations to both permit the
delineation of individual shell facies (i.e., culturally significant depositional units) and to increase available sample
sizes.
The results of this analysis are discussed in detail in
Chapter 7, but a few relevant observations and comments
are more appropriately presented here. For example, the percentage of fragmented shell to total shell weight (minimum
of20 g) ranges from 0.0 to 45.7 percent. The average in Test
Unit 2 is around 20 percent, which is slightly higher than the
percentages in prehistoric Level 5 in UnitN143/E99. While
there appears to be greater variability in degree of fragmentation in UnitN140/El08, this may be at least in part a sampling effect. All three of the ratios greater than 25 percent
from this unit (Level 9 in Quadrats F, H, and K) have MNI
less than 20 and total weights of around 150 g or less. Conversely, of the four proveniences with 0 percent measured
fragmentation (Level 6 in Quad J and Level 9 in Quads D, 0,
and P), two have MNI's over 25 and total weights of ca. 200
gm or more (Quads D and 0 ). Since there does not appear to
be any patterned excavator bias between these quadrats, it
may be that the absence of fragmentation does circumscribe
or outline an area of more heavily burned shell (possibly a
hearth or discard pile, see Chapter 7), although the percentages of unburned shell are (with the exception of Quad P)
rather low. Fragmentation percentages for the shovel tests
and probes are slightly higher, due perhaps to screening
method and the manual breaking up of hard, dried clay matrix. The very low percentage for Test Trench A-SW-9 clearly

337

reflects collector bias towards whole, intact specimens. The
anomolously low fragmentation percentage for Test Unit 1
probably does reflect bias in the degree of effort expended
during excavation.
Estimated MNI and weight densities per m2 were also
calculated for each provenience in the excavation units.
While these estimations at first appear highly variable, the
average densities of the units are remarkably similar. The
large variations are due primarily to provenience unit size
(i.e., quad dimensions). For example, the prehistoric shell
lenses in Test Units l and 2 are very similar in terms of
estimated density. Both have estimated MNI/m2 in the mid
to low 200s and weights between roughly 1.5 and 2 kg. Meanwhile, although the calculated estimates in Level 5 of Test
Unit N143/E99 clearly show a greater density of shell in the
northern quadrats (AA and BB), the average of all four quads
together are roughly similar to those from the two initial test
units: MNI/m2 (286) is slightly greater but still under 300 and
weight/m2 ( 1,519.7) is just over 1.5 kg. Even more dramatic is
the variability noted in the main shell-bearing excavation
levels (6and9) in UnitN140/El08, where 25-x-25-cmqaudrats
were used. Proveniences with the highest total shell weights
(e.g., Level 6 in Quads I and J and Level 9 in Quads C, D, G,
H, and 0) have estimated shell densities in excess of 4 (and
approaching 5) kg and MNI counts nearing 500 individuals.
With the exception of Quad H, Level 9, all quadrats with total
shell weight in excess of 150 g have estimated shell densities
of at least 400 MNI and 2.5 kg. On the other hand, adjacent
25-x-25cm quadrats show much lower total shell weights
and correspondingly low estimated shell densities. Nonetheless, the average density for the entire 1-x- l-m unit is
remarkably similar to those previously discussed: for Levels
6 and 9, the average MNl/m2 is 272.0 and 229 .3 and the average weight/m2 is 1,558.8 and 1,910.4, respectively. What may
be inferrred from these results is that while the average density of shell is roughly similar wherever it appears within the
site (i.e., excluding areas which completely lack shell such as
adjacent Unit N139/El07), shell densities are roughly similar
but that excavation unit sizes of 1-x-1 m (or even 50-x-50 cm)
may be masking significant distributional variability (see also
discussion in Chapter 7 regarding evaluation ofTARL field
methods).
Note also the generally close agreement in terms ofleft/
right umbo symmetry between provenience units on Tables
47 and 48. When counts for different quadrats from the same
level are combined, the agreement is even closer. This is
consistent with the assumption of refuse localization (cf.
Aten 1983:13), or more specifically, the lack of patterned
discard variation which might suggest secondary dumping.
The only exception to this general pattern is Test Unit 2
where a much greater number of right umbos were recovered
from Level 5 than were left umbos. While the relatively large
number of indeterminate umbos recovered in this level may
partially explain this discrepency, possible reasons for the
preferential fragmentation ofleft umbos are unknown.

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

The oyster ( Crassostrea virginica) shells and fragments
recovered were generally larger and more complete than the
Rangia specimens. Most are associated with the historic
41HR576 upper levels of the site, although a number were
found in the prehistoric shell lens in Unit N140/E108. No
MNI determinations were made on these specimens, only
simple counts of oyster shell fragments and total weight
(Tables 49 and 50). Systemic examination for evidence of
burning was done only on the Rangia shell, not on oyster
shells from either 41HR576 or the prehistoric levels in
41HR121. Nonetheless, virtually all of the oyster shell from
the prehistoric levels was observed to be fragmentary and
was presumably burned to some degree (by the inclusive
criteria established for this study).

Three land snails were also recovered during TARL investigations (Table 51 ). These were all identified as a single
species of Polygyra sp. (Ken Brown, personal communication 1999) and are almost certainly recent specimens not
associated with the 41HR121 prehistoric deposit.
Finally, Neyland collected a number of Rangia and oyster shells from 41HR33 which are reported in Table 52. These
were apparently random and highly selective collections
meant to serve as representative examples (see Neyland
notebooks). They include individual specimens as well as
shell contained within sediment samples. Nearly all of these
specimens are whole and unbroken and are reported as
simple counts in light of their low numbers and biased sampling.

APPENDIX N: SELECTED NOTES AND PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE
NEYLAND COLLECTION
by Paul R. Takac and Russell K. Brownlow

----------

Page intentionally left blank.

Appendix N: Selected Notes and Photographs in the Neyland Collection

The Neyland collection, most of which was donated to
TARL in the early 1970s, contains a large number of notebooks, photographs, maps, artifact collections, correspondence, and assorted material related to Wayne Neyland's
archeological interests and investigations over approximately a 20-year period, beginning in the 1950s. This appendix documents only those written materials, maps, and photographs related to his 1957 to 1959 investigations of sites
along the southeastern (right) bank of Buffalo Bayou, immediately upstream of the San Jacinto Battlefield State Park.
This includes sites 41HR33 (Neyland's designation Houston Ship Channel [HSC] #4), 41HR104 (HSC#5), 41HR105
(HSC #6), 41HR121 (HSC #7), 41HR122 (HSC #8), and
41HR123 (HSC #9). A detailed discussion ofNeyland's investigations at these sites is provided in Chapter 7. Artifact
and faunal collections from these sites are included, where
appropriate, in other appendixes to this volume.
The Neyland materials include a relative abundance of
field and laboratory notes, especially given the time and
circumstances of the investigations. While they are certainly
not sufficient by modem, professional standards, they are
exceptionally detailed in many ways, although much ambiguity remains when dealing in details and particular instances.
Outlined below is an annotated summary of dated entries in
notebooks kept by Neyland to record his field activities and
observations at these sites. This provides a timeline of events
and periods related to the discovery and investigation of
the south bank sites. In addition to the entries and annotations included in the outline, a number of entries relate to
other sites not included in the present study. A large number of other notebooks, photographs, and collections also
exist that are not related to these sites. Most of the relevant
maps are reproduced in Chapter 7. In addition to the field
notebooks, a spiral bound photolog notebook and a folder
of loose sheet photologs are also available and were consulted to resolve particular questions.
Organized chronologically, the outline includes selected
correspondence between Neyland and E. Mott Davis at The
University of Texas at Austin that pertained to the sites.
Davis acted as an unofficial liaison and provided occasional
advice and information during the course of these investigations. For each date, a brief description of the field or
laboratory work undertaken is provided along with relevant
details regarding specific artifacts or samples where appropriate. These entries are of course limited by the detail provided in the original Neyland entries. Notes enclosed in
brackets are editing comments or clarifications provided by
Takac.
Tables 54 and 55 list individual photoprints and slides
of the south bank sites curated in the Neyland collection.
They include both field and laboratory images. Most of the
prints also have accompanying negatives. The tables are
organized by TARL accession number, assigned when the
collection was originally curated. They also list the date, roll
and exposure numbers, and handwritten descriptive notes

349

(on the prints themselves, the mounting cards, or the slides).
In some cases, these descriptive notations include perspective direction and detailed explanations of what is represented, while in other cases they do not. The notes in quotations have been reproduced verbatim with editorial clarifications or corrections, if any confined to additions in brackets. Some of the slides and color prints have begun to fade
and/or darken, and hence, many of these have been electronically scanned to provide a digital archive of them before they are completely and permanently decolorized. Like
the notebook entries, these represent only a portion of the
material included in the Neyland collection.
The information contained in the tables in this appendix
were the primary source for the reconstructions and interpretations of 41HR33 and related sites offered in Chapter 7.

mortar [if so, not in collection] recovered from F.P.
#2 along with two pieces of deer bone
Also recovered multiple deer bones from eroding
bank in E75' area [originally thought to be a human
burial but later determined to be deer bones]
May6, 1957
Returned to H.S.C. #4 [41HR33]
Took first photographs of 41HR33 site area
Noted cows had damaged wooden marker stakes
Collected more sherds and bone at various places
along bankline
Mayll,1957
Returned to H.S.C. #4 [41HR33], high tide, lower
portions of site inundated
Took additional photographs (roll # 25)
Collected bone, a yellow chert nodule [33CR-4],
and sherds from bank (collected by E-W provenience)
Worked in A2 (W0'-5')
Recovered sherds "to Vessel XXI" [this is incorrect; probably Vessel XXII]

and beach
Found "Perdiz point" in A2 (W0'-5') wall [later determined to be possible flake graver, see 33PP-4]
Examined "burial" and determined that it was actually a deer skeleton
Removed "black clay" overburden from E5'- l O' and
recovered some sherds from shell lens
While getting ready to leave, watched the impact
of ship generated waves on bank. Saw more sherds
eroding from on or just above shell lens in the black
clay [in W5'-10'] and retrieved them [Note: these
were later determined to refit into flat base with a
single, distinct lobe and found to be "sherd-tempered," see Appendix D.]
Notes that handmade bricks found resting on the
clay in E5'-10' supports his assumption that the
upper layer of sand on the site is recent
May 19, 1957 (possibly written 5/23/57)
Chronicles his conference with Dick Worthington
concerning the "lobed" or "teated" basal sherd recovered from H.S.C. #4 [41HR33] the previous day
Worthington also had a similar sherd from his Peggy
Lake site. Sherd-tempered ceramics termed San
Jacinto Ware
Both agreed that this type of ceramic was late chronologically and was in agreement with Wheat's findings in the Addicks Reservoir.
Worthington also gave to Neyland sherds and bone
he recovered from H.S.C. #4 [41HR33].
May 20, 1957 (possibly written 5/23/57)

the bank [actually untyped, broken stem 33PP-8]
Also recovered decorated (incised) rim sherds to a
new vessel [Vessel XXI] in black clay 1 to 1 1/2"
above shell lens [Note: this is a grog-tempered
sherd, like the noded base, also found
stratigraphically above the shell lens.]

41HR78]
Noted that 41HR33 had suffered little erosion since

Morgan's Point to Buffalo Bayou, Harris County, Texas

the last visit with the exception ofE70'-75', where
the distance between shell lenses is apparently
decreasing as erosion proceeds [Note: again, this
is consistent with the inference of a localized slump
of a large block of sediment, including the clay and
shell lens, as it was undercut by erosion]
Collected approximately 30 sherds from Fire Pit No.
1 (E20'-25') area and 20 sherds from western end of
site

HSC #4 [41HR33] and about 20 or 30 sherds collected
Notes minimal erosion at site during that time
Speculates that double shell lay!!rs (separated by

January 19 and 27, 1959, labeled "Commentary Notes"
These entries consist of general statements regard-

ing H.S.C. #4 [41HR33] since December 14, 1957
Continuing pattern of erosion but severity varied
in different parts of the site (especially eastern halt)
Describes washouts and bank undercutting
Erosion very pronounced in N5'/E70-75' area of
double shell layer
5'-6' of erosion evidenced by isolated tree stump
Notes that [subsided] shell layers that are normally
submerged are protected somewhat by overlying
black clay
Selected color slides to be retained
February 8, 1959 (written 219/59)
Returned to H.S.C. #4 [41HR33] with Dwayne and
R. B. Worthington and Richard (son)
Collected perhaps 100 sherds a Gary point [possibly 33PP-3], and "the majority" of exposed bone
Ventured farther west [upstream] along bank to
view one of the sites found by their sons
Notes erosion on western end of site and intermittent distribution of exposed shell lenses for several
hundred feet along the base of a gently sloping
ridge.
Established a hypothetical line separating H.S.C.
#4 [41HR33] from this new site, H.S.C. #7 [41HR121]
which Neyland describes as "a vague area" [i.e.,
loosely defined and bounded]. The latter site is
bounded to the west [upstream] by a small gully.
The other site discovered by the boys is farther
west on the eastern end of a larger gully. Described
as "a distinct knoll created by the underlying deposit ofloose friable shell and dark, black soil"
RecordedassiteH.S.C.#8 [41HR122].
Worthington excavated a small test unit at this site
[about 16" deep] and recovered two sherds [in
Neyland Collection, both plan sandy paste]
[Note: This may be the same area identified as
4 lHRl 21 and tested by TARL, see Chapter 7]
Farther west on the opposite [western] side ofthis
larger gully, eroded shell was noted in a ravine along
with a flake
Recorded as site H.S.C. #9 [ 41HR123]
Notes that "these last three sites are all with 1/4
mile of HSC #4 [41HR33] and were plotted on

Appendix 0: TARL Forms, Advanced Testing at 41HR121, Spring 1998

The following forms were used by TARL personnel
during test excavations at 41HR121 in the spring of 1998.
As discussed in Chapters 7 and 8, excavation strategy was
focused on maximizing horizontal provenience resolution
while minimizing field time and redundant documentation.
These forms were developed to permit the excavation of
either four 50-x-50-cm quadrants (Unit Master Level Record,
50 cm by 50 cm Quadrants)) or sixteen 25-x-25-cm quadrats
(Unit Master Level Record, 25 cm by 25 cm Quadrants)
while retaining the 1-m excavation unit as the primary unit
of recordation. Used as a matter of course for the 1998
TARL investigations, but optional for future investigations,
"addendum" sheets for the 50-cm quadrant grid (Individual
Quad Level Record, 50 cm by 50 cm) or the 25-cm quadrat

system (Individual Quad Level Record, 25 cm by 25 cm)
were also available and were developed to permit the recording of fine detail or sketches if necessary. Several particulars of these forms proved impractical and would be
changed for future investigations. For example, the density of magnetic susceptibility and elevation readings
proved to be too numerous within each 25-cm quadrat.
Standard practice was therefore modified so that three susceptibility readings (in a triangular pattern) and only a single
line level elevation (from the center) were taken in each
quadrat. Nonetheless, the actual field forms (as they were
originally designed) have been reproduced here. The efficacy of using these forms is discussed in detail in Chapters 7 and 8.
