Abstract

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an archeological survey along the
Falcon Lake and Rio Grande shoreline in Zapata County, Texas, on behalf of the
United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission
(USIBWC), El Paso, Texas. The project area extends from the Rio Grande at the
Webb and Zapata County line, near Arroyo Dolores, downstream approximately
13.7 miles to just north of San Ygnacio, and from the United States
jurisdictional boundary in the reservoir to the 307-foot traverse taking line.
Hicks & Company field survey covered approximately 624.89 acres within the
boundary limits of the proposed USIBWC study area. The entire project area
was subject to systematic 100% pedestrian survey with shovel testing to one
meter in depth in all undisturbed areas exhibiting the potential to contain
buried archeological deposits.
Shovel tests were not conducted in
disturbed/destroyed areas. No backhoe trenching was conducted during the
current study. Backhoe trenching was not included in the USIBWC scope of
work for the project. No new archeological sites were documented within the
proposed project area during the current study.
A single previously recorded archeological site overlaps the project area
(41ZP96). There is very little available information regarding this site on the
Texas Historic Sites Atlas. The portion of the site overlapping the USIBWC
property was determined destroyed by modern residential settlement and
agricultural development. No further Section 110 or 106 investigations or
cultural resource coordination is recommended for 41ZP96 relative to the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
A single archeological site (41ZP924), however, was observed and recorded on
private property within the USIBWC flood easement located between the 307
and 314-foot traverse taking lines. This site is a probable prehistoric site and
has the potential to contain intact buried cultural deposits.
Further
archeological work and coordination is recommended should there be any
Section 106 undertakings resulting in ground disturbing impacts within the site
area. This report recommends that the site be avoided and protected until it has
been surveyed and tested for eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) (if warranted) should there be any site related federal undertakings with
proposed ground disturbing impacts.
Pedestrian survey and shovel testing demonstrate there are no shallowly buried,
intact, well preserved archeological sites in the project area (sites less than one
meter in depth). Large sections of the project area however, consist primarily of
deep, Rio Grande flood terrace deposits which exhibit good potential for buried
archeological sites.
These high probability areas should be avoided and
protected until the deeper deposits have been assessed with systematic backhoe
trenching relative to Section 110 and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA). Portions of two remaining unsurveyed drainages
adjacent to the south and central project areas are recommended for
archeological survey under Section 110 and 106 of the NHPA. It is the
recommendation of the Principal Investigators that all identified disturbed and
destroyed areas as mapped under the current investigations warrant no further
archeological investigations and no further consideration under Section 110 or
106.

Executive Summary

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Between December 3-5, 2006 and January 17-25, 2007, Hicks & Company
conducted an archeological survey along the Falcon Lake and Rio Grande
shoreline in Zapata County, Texas on behalf of the United States Section,
International Boundary and Water Commission (USIBWC), El Paso, Texas
(Figure 1). The project was conducted at the request of the USIBWC to partially
satisfy archeological site inventory and eligibility determinations under Section
110 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The project was conducted
under USIBWC ARPA Permit No. 0014 (Archeological Resources Protection Act)
to enable survey on federal property. The project area extends from the Rio
Grande at the Webb and Zapata County line, near Arroyo Dolores, downstream
approximately 13.7 miles to just north of San Ygnacio, and from the United
States jurisdictional boundary in the reservoir to the 307-foot traverse taking
line.
The goals of the USIBWC are to continue a program of historic property
inventory in recently exposed areas of shoreline relative to the development and
implementation of a Falcon Reservoir Cultural Resource Management Plan
(CRMP). The Management Plan focuses on the documentation, evaluation,
and/or mitigation of NRHP eligible sites relative to land and water use, other
Reservoir environmental resources, resident leasing rights, and the destruction
of important NRHP sites due to erosion, vandalism, and fluctuating lake levels.
Current investigations are part of a broader USIBWC study undertaken to
facilitate long-term planning activities and resource management of the
International Falcon Dam and Reservoir. The scope included utilizing the
survey data to make cultural resource management recommendations on short
and long-term planning activities for the Falcon Reservoir, and update the
USIBWC Geographic Information System project files.
The project scope of work consisted of selecting approximately 600 acres within
the proposed study area for a 100% intensive pedestrian field survey with
systematic shovel testing of all undisturbed areas exhibiting the potential for
intact archeological sites. Selected areas approximating 600 acres in the project
were coordinated and approved by the USIBWC and included as part of the
ARPA permit. Ultimately, archeologists surveyed approximately 624.89 acres
within the proposed USIBWC study area. Within the 13.7 mile project length,
two areas totaling 117.35 acres were not surveyed and not included in the
current investigations. These are two erosional drainages that extend up to US
83 adjacent to the project area. One is located in the southern project area
south of Area 2 (see Plate 2). The other is Arroyo Dolores located in the central
project area. Investigators surveyed only a portion of these drainages due to
relatively steep terrain and the erosional nature of the topography, one not
conducive to prehistoric occupation nor the preservation of archeological sites.
Project areas with the potential to contain intact, buried archeological sites were
classified apriori as high and moderate probability for the presence of sites
based on a number of factors including topography, terrain, geology, land use,
degree of disturbance, depositional context, archeological site context, and field
observations. These classifications were confirmed through field observations.
A total of 165.12 acres were classified as high probability for buried
archeological sites, and 194.43 acres as moderate probability for intact, buried
archeological sites. These areas were subjected to intensive 100% pedestrian
survey with systematic shovel testing. A total of 263 shovel tests were excavated

v

Executive Summary

over the length of the approximate 13.7 mile project. All shovel tests were
negative for cultural materials. Because of significant variation in project width
and terrain, along its 13.7 mile length, three different shovel testing strategies
were employed in high and moderate probability areas: 1) All linear areas less
than 200 foot in width were shovel tested at intervals of 16 tests per mile per
100 foot width according to Texas Historical Commission (THC) archeology
survey standards for linear projects; 2) Area 1 consisting of a broad area over
1200 feet in width and of approximately 100 acres was shovel tested at 1 test
every 2 acres (79 tests), according to the THC minimum acreage survey
standards for projects up to 100 acres in size and 3) Area 2 consisting of a broad
area over 1900 feet in width and approximately 144 acres was shovel tested at 1
test for every 3 acres (56 tests) according to the THC minimum acreage survey
standards for projects up to 200 acres in size.
Severely disturbed and virtually destroyed areas were classified as low
probability for intact archeological sites.
These areas were identified by
pedestrian survey, field observation and recording. Limited shovel testing was
conducted in some but not all disturbed and destroyed areas only to confirm
ground conditions and disturbance. A total of 265.34 acres were classified as
low probability disturbed and destroyed areas.
No new archeological sites were documented within delineated project
boundaries during the current study. One previously recorded archeological site
overlaps project area boundaries in the central project area (41ZP96). There is
virtually no information other than location in the Texas Historical Commission
Sites Atlas regarding site 41ZP96. Field crews accessed USIBWC property by
driving through this site and traversing portions of the site on foot. The portion
of the site within the project area boundary was determined disturbed and
destroyed. This area is currently the location of several surface encumbrances
including residential and industrial structures, a pump house (located near the
edge of the upper terrace), and a large amount of heavy farming equipment.
Vehicular traffic has further modified the surface of the site, with several traffic
loops surrounding the small residential/farming complex. The site location
appears to be completely destroyed and heavily modified by modern activity.
Four previously recorded archeological sites are located adjacent to but not
overlapping the surveyed extent of the USIBWC property boundary (307 foot
traverse). Three of these are Spanish Colonial ranch sites (41ZP74, 41ZP77, and
41ZP78). Site 41ZP74 is the NRHP listed Corralitos Ranch. Site 41ZP77 is
listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). These sites relate to
the original Spanish settlement of the area and founding of the community of
Dolores. Both sites (41ZP77 and 41ZP78) sit on the high terrace that overlooks
relatively narrow stretches of the project area (307 foot traverse taking line) in
the central and northern project area and neither intersects the current project.
The Corralitos Ranch settlement (41ZP74) is located approximately 750 feet east
of the USIBWC project area and does not overlap the project.
Prehistoric Site 41ZP191 is located along an unnamed arroyo in the central
project area adjacent to one eastern edge of the 307 foot traverse taking line (see
Plate 4). Site 41ZP191 was recommended for further investigations by the
original surveyors. Investigators determined that the site does not extend onto
USIBWC property (307 foot traverse taking line). The drainage which traverses
Site 41ZP191 is defined by sheer, erosional banks on both sides, significantly
limiting the possibility for intact site preservation. The topographic setting
within the 307 foot traverse taking line was one of a steep sided erosional

Executive Summary

drainage (slope greater than 20%) and not a setting for a prehistoric occupation
site nor one conducive to the preservation of intact site deposits. The USIBWC
property bounded by the 307 foot traverse taking line at this location was
identified as disturbed and destroyed. Due to the observed environmental
conditions, it is probable that the site only exists on the relatively flat terrace
overlooking the drainage outside of USIBWC property.
Two additional prehistoric sites are previously recorded overlapping US 83 in the
southern project area (41ZP889, 890). The sites as mapped are located adjacent
to unsurveyed portions of USIBWC property (307 foot traverse taking line) (see
Plate 2). Sites 41ZP890 and 889 abut the very eastern edge of the 307 foot
traverse along an unnamed arroyo adjacent to US 83 in the central portion of
the project. Site 41ZP889 is previously recorded as destroyed. Site 41ZP890
was previously mapped in the right-of-way of US 83 and recommended for
further investigations by the original surveyors. These areas should be surveyed
for archeological sites prior to any ground disturbing activities by the USIBWC,
and to determine whether Site 41ZP890 overlaps USIBWC property.
A single new, archeological site (41ZP924), however, was observed and the
location recorded adjacent to the north central project area (307 foot traverse
taking line). Site 41ZP924 is situated on private land within the USIBWC
flowage and flood easement located between the 307-314 foot traverse taking
lines.
Site 41ZP924 was observed approximately 35-40 meters east of the
project boundary 307-foot traverse taking line, on higher topography. The site
was observed while crossing private property to gain access to the project area
which is topographically below the 307 foot traverse taking line. Although the
general location of Site 41ZP924 was mapped during the current survey, no
subsurface testing, site mapping or recording was conducted since it was
located outside of the proposed project area on private property. Areas between
the 307-314 traverse taking lines represent USIBWC flowage or flood easement
on private property and were not identified as part of the current project. The
USIBWC has the right to flood the zone during seldom encountered flood
conditions, but has no other management responsibilities on this private land.
Site 41ZP924 is a probable Late Prehistoric archeological site. Artifacts observed
on site included lithic debitage, a single ceramic sherd, an unidentified thin
biface/projectile point, early stage bifaces, burned rock fragments, mussel shell,
ground stone, and bone fragments, all observed on the ground surface. The site
is located on higher topography overlooking the USIBWC 307 traverse property
line boundary and appears significantly eroded by natural environmental
factors. 41ZP924 has the potential to contain intact buried cultural deposits
and subsurface testing is recommended to determine the vertical and horizontal
extent of the site and its eligibility status for the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) should there be any Section 106 undertakings resulting in
ground disturbing impacts with the site area.
Field crew access to USIBWC property was facilitated by the Mr. Raul Garcia,
the Falcon Lease and License Manager at the Falcon Field Office, in Falcon
Heights, Texas. Mr. Garcia flagged five different access points for the crew to
exit US 83 and travel west to the 307 foot traverse taking line.
These access
points were a combination of private ranch roads and public county roads. In
each case involving private property, Mr. Garcia coordinated with landowners to
allow the field crew to access USIBWC lands. The crew was able to utilize all of
the flagged access points successfully. One additional non-flagged access point
was utilized in the northern project area. Generally, the crew drove vehicles on

Archeological Survey â Falcon Reservoir 600 Acre Survey in Zapata County, Texas â August 2007

vii

Executive Summary

a combination of county roads and private roads through private land getting as
close to the project area as possible, before traversing the remaining distance on
foot. In each case, Mr. Garcia coordinated with any private landowners where
necessary to allow access. Importantly, none of the ingress/egress routes were
surveyed. Although a few county roads were employed, these routes invariably
traversed over considerable distances of private property to access USIBWC
lands which were not identified as part of the current investigations. The
eastern limit of the project survey was the 307 foot traverse taking line.
High and moderate probability areas consist of relatively deep Rio Grand flood
terrace deposits, with the potential for deeply buried prehistoric archeological
sites. While shovel testing indicates there are no shallowly buried intact
archeological sites in the project area, these deep Holocene age river terraces
exhibit considerable potential to contain buried prehistoric archeological sites,
based on terrain, setting, context and geomorphology, and on the presence of
similarly documented sites in these settings in the region. It is the opinion of
the Principal Investigators that all high and moderate probability areas as
delineated in this report should be avoided and protected until the deeper
deposits have been assessed with systematic backhoe trenching relative to
Section 110 and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
The two remaining unsurveyed portions of land within the 307 foot traverse
taking line should be surveyed for the presence of archeological sites relative to
Section 110 and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
It is the recommendation of the Principal Investigators that all identified
disturbed and destroyed areas as mapped under the current investigations
warrant no further archeological investigations nor any further archeology
consideration under Section 110 or 106. There are no current USIBWC projects
with proposed ground disturbing impacts below the immediate ground surface
within the project area. All project related documents and materials will be
professionally curated at the Center for Archeological Research (CAR) at the
University of Texas-San Antonio in San Antonio, Texas.

Introduction

INTRODUCTION
PROJECT BACKGROUND
Falcon Reservoir is the second and lowermost reservoir jointly constructed by
the United States and Mexico by the International Boundary and Water
Commission (IBWC) on the Rio Grande, under the original 1944 Water Treaty.
The function of the dam is to control and regulate the flow of international
waters and to provide a means of contributing to the mutual social and
economic welfare of Mexico and the United States. The dam is located
approximately 75 miles (121 km) downstream from Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo
Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The Falcon Reservoir extends from the U.S.
jurisdictional boundary in the reservoir to the 307-foot federal property line
(traverse line), generally from the Webb and Zapata County line at Arroyo
Dolores extending south to Falcon Dam, near the Falcon Reservoir State Park. A
total of 851 archeological sites are documented on USIBWC controlled property.
Many of these were recorded after inundation. This is among the highest
archeological site density recorded in any one area of Texas.
Cultural resources on USIBWC controlled lands represent the evolution of an
international cultural landscape comprising approximately 10,000 years of
human occupation, culminating in the 18th century Spanish colonization of
Texas, the Republic of Texas, and the development of the international border
between Mexico and the United States. It can be argued that the Falcon
Reservoir area is NRHP eligible at the district level based on several criteria.
Recent reconnaissance survey of exposed shorelines resulted in 34 individual
archaeological sites determined NRHP eligible and 130 additional sites
considered eligible by the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)
(Parsons 2004). A number of these sites, including inundated sites, contain
architectural components with building foundations and the ruins of early
Spanish ranchos. Many historic sites are considered eligible because of their
direct association with the 18th century Hispanic colonization of Texas and the
lower Rio Grande Valley, and their association with the cattle ranching industry
in Texas and North America. Several historic cemeteries are documented in the
reservoir area. Scores of prehistoric sites are considered eligible for their
potential to yield important prehistoric information spanning several thousand
years on the Texas/Mexico border region. Many of the prehistoric sites contain
ancient human burials.
A significant number of archeological sites at the Falcon Reservoir are damaged
or are at risk for damage from erosion caused by fluctuating water levels in the
reservoir. When exposed, many of these sites are doubly and triply threatened
by looting and illicit artifact collection. NRHP eligible sites are being adversely
effected by lakeshore erosion and artifact surface collection/looting and require
immediate attention by the USIBWC. This situation has attained crisis level in
recent years as the reservoir level fluctuates. The Texas SHPO has since
identified 88 damaged or at risk sites from water level fluctuation and vandalism
(Parsons 2004).
Approximately 350 total sites are identified through
reconnaissance survey to be damaged from erosion or at risk due to their
exposure to fluctuating water levels and wave action (Parsons 2004). These
represent a mix of NRHP eligible and sites of undetermined eligibility. Eroding
sites with burials are a particular concern. Recreational, agricultural, and other
modern land use has also contributed to the erosion and damage of

Introduction

archeological sites. The cumulative effects of erosion and modern land use are
an immediate threat to the cultural resources at Falcon Reservoir.
The current proposed Falcon Reservoir project area consists primarily of Rio
Grande flood terraces in a riverine setting, especially in the northern most
portion of the project area. These terraces are frequently flooded and are often
intensively vegetated, aggrading alluvial zones. It is important to point out that
the current study area is not subject to intensive erosion as typically
encountered along the reservoir shoreline in the southern portions of Zapata
County. Areas adjacent to the reservoir shoreline in southern portions of Zapata
County are heavily eroded due to fluctuating water levels since the 1950âs.
The proposed project represents a due diligence effort on the part of the USIBWC
to continue cultural resource identification and Section 110 coordination for
endangered archeological sites. While there is no official federal undertaking,
the USIBWC wishes to identify NRHP eligible properties for possible treatment,
mitigation, and/or preservation relative to reservoir water functions and land
management practices. Many of the current land management practices such
as grazing have the potential to impact NRHP eligible sites. The USIBWC has
recently developed a Cultural Resource Management Plan (Parsons 2004) to
address inventory, evaluation, treatment and mitigation goals under Section 110
of the NHPA within the context of Falcon Dam land management priorities. The
northern terminus of the proposed project area is located along the Rio Grande
at the Webb and Zapata County line near the Arroyo Dolores. The study area
travels south adjacent to the Rio Grande before terminating just north of San
Ygnacio, Texas. It is important to mention that previous reconnaissance surveys
conducted over approximately 6000 acres downstream of San Ygnacio have
resulted in the identification of numerous sites and Section 106 coordination
concerning these sites with the Texas SHPO.

PROJECT STRUCTURE
Personnel structure of the project is consistent with a previous 2006 Hicks &
Company survey working on behalf of the USIBWC. Hicks and Company
recently completed the Falcon Reservoir Salvage Project which included
approximately 400 acres of combination intensive and reconnaissance survey
with shovel testing in the Northern and Central Unsurveyed Areas of the Falcon
Reservoir under Archeological Resources Protection Act Permit 0010 (Karbula et
al. 2006). Under this federal permit, James Karbula and Tim Perttula were
approved Co-Principal investigators.
Credentials meeting expertise
requirements for the project personnel under the project scope were submitted
to the USIBWC and subsequently approved by the Texas SHPO prior to project
inception. For this project, Hicks & Company proposed and coordinated SHPO
approval of intensive shovel testing in all areas with the potential for buried
sites, which was a completely different survey protocol than had previously been
employed by the USIBWC during many years of reservoir investigations. With
the advent of shovel testing at Falcon Reservoir in 2006, Hicks & Company was
able to coordinate NRHP eligibility determinations on numerous prehistoric sites
with the Texas SHPO. The Falcon Reservoir Salvage Project also included test
level investigations and feature salvage of a shallowly buried prehistoric site
(41ZP845), under the direction of Dr. Karbula. Report production included test
level analyses as defined by Chapter 26 of the Rules of Practice and Procedure
for the Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) to determine site eligibility for the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP). NRHP evaluations were conducted according

Archeological Survey â Falcon Reservoir 600 Acre Survey in Zapata County, Texas â August 2007

Introduction

to the USIBWC and SHPO approved scope of work for the project, and as
detailed in ARPA Permit 0010, and consistent with 36 CFR 60.4 of the National
Park Service criteria for determining formal NRHP eligibility of archeological
sites. Analyses included radiocarbon dating of charred wood samples in feature
contexts, flotation matrix analyses of feature sediment samples, lithics and
faunal analyses.
Under the current investigations, James Karbula and Tim Perttula were once
again listed as Co-Principal Investigators under ARPA Permit 0014. The CoPrincipal Investigator strategy was based on Dr. Karbulaâs experience in
identifying and evaluating prehistoric sites for state and federal agencies in
many Texas regions, including the previous Falcon Reservoir Salvage Project,
and on Dr. Perttulaâs long and outstanding record of evaluating archeological
sites, especially historic-age and Spanish Colonial archeological sites, and on his
extensive record of publications and fieldwork in the Falcon Reservoir area. As
such, Dr. Perttulaâs role in the current project was identified as historic-age and
Spanish Colonial expertise, and quality assurance/quality control for the survey
report, especially in regards to formal NRHP eligibility recommendations and site
evaluations.
In terms of prehistoric expertise, Dr. Karbula has functioned as Hicks &
Company Project Manager and Principal Investigator for over 10 years
successfully completing more than 45 Texas Antiquities Code Permits (TAC) for
both prehistoric and historic surveys, and testing and data recovery projects in
multiple Texas regions (Phase I, II and III investigations).
As Principal
Investigator, Dr. Karbula has expertise in preparing complex research designs,
predictive models, background studies, archival research, impact evaluations
and in conducting both reconnaissance and 100% pedestrian surveys with
extensive subsurface testing. Dr. Karbula has directed successful testing and
data recovery projects on a variety of prehistoric sites including burned rock
midden and open occupation sites. Crews supervised by Dr. Karbula have
recorded hundreds of buried and surface prehistoric sites across the state of
Texas, from the Panhandle to West and south Texas and the Rio Grande. Field
and analytical expertise includes directing large mechanical investigations, total
station transit site mapping, lithics analysis, interpreting projectile point
typologies, site chronologies, and the presentation of contextual and
distributional studies utilizing site records and graphics software. Similar to the
Rio Grande terrace setting, James has conducted intensive mechanical field
investigations in deep terrace sites of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River (Tarrant
Co.), San Antonio River (Bexar Co.), Onion and Barton Creeks (Travis Co.),
Brushy and Berry Creeks (Williamson Co.), Texas to name just a few, often
supervising project construction schedules, permanent staff and large field
crews. As such, Dr. Karbulaâs role in the current project was identified as field
supervisor, and prehistoric expertise, and especially in regards to formal NRHP
eligibility recommendations and site evaluations for prehistoric sites.
The following excerpt from the contract scope as approved by the USIBWC
details project structure:
Dr. Tim Perttula and Dr. James Karbula will function as Co-Principal
Investigators to ensure project field and report expertise and quality control. Dr.
Karbula will supervise evaluation of prehistoric sites and general survey
operations. Dr. Karbula and Hicks & Company will function as primary report
authors detailing results of field investigations. Dr. Perttula will supervise
evaluation of all historic and Spanish Colonial sites. Dr. Perttula will conduct

Introduction

fieldwork in the event of a discovery evaluating historic-age or Spanish Colonial
sites, or any sites with human remains. Dr. Perttula will have a project
management role in quality assurance and quality control, in report production
oversight and editing, and evaluating methods, interpretations and formal
recommendations. By all accounts, Dr. Perttula is one of the most accomplished
editors working in archeological literature in the State of Texas.

SUMMARY
Field investigations were conducted between December 3-5, 2006 and January
17-25, 2006, utilizing a five person crew. James W. Karbula and Timothy K.
Perttula functioned as Co-Principal Investigators for the project. Brian King
functioned as Project Archeologist; Matthew Stotts functioned as Crew Chief.
Robert Lassen, Suzy Smith, and David Peyton functioned as field archeological
technicians. Mr. Silverio Garza, the Falcon Dam Supervisory Facility Manager
at the Falcon Field Office, in Falcon Heights, Texas provided support and
assistance during the survey. Mr. Raul Garcia, the Falcon Lease and License
Manager at the Falcon Field Office, in Falcon Heights, Texas coordinated
property right-of-entry for the archeological team, as well as identifying the 307Â­
foot traverse taking line in the field and providing historic maps depicting the
project area 307-foot traverse taking line.
Considerable logistical difficulties were encountered in two respects. At first,
access was denied to Falcon Reservoir lands by the Falcon Dam Facility
Manager due to the imminent dangers of deer hunting season taking place on
adjacent private property. Excavations slated for December were postponed
until after hunting season in late January. Second, there were no recent maps
or available survey coordinates depicting the 307 traverse property boundary
and no property boundary markers in the field. The original property boundary
markers appear long since disturbed or moved. The property boundaries crissÂ­
crossed a confusing array of private fences and different topographies resulting
from many years of blurred boundary distinctions between private landowners
and federal property. The property boundary was clearly established, however,
by collecting, organizing, and georeferencing a series of the old historic maps
from the 1950âs relating to the original survey of the 307 and 314 foot traverse
taking lines. These maps were provided by the Falcon Lease and License
Manager while in the field and depicted the property boundaries as originally
surveyed. The maps were taken to Laredo, scanned on a large format scanner,
and relayed electronically to Hicks & Company GIS specialists. Using the latest
aerial photography and topographic maps, GIS personnel were able to use GPS
coordinates taken from the current survey investigations, correlate to known
landmarks and georectify the historic maps onto modern aerials and
topographic maps, thus providing georeferenced graphic depictions to scale of
the 307 foot traverse property boundary. These data were then relayed back to
the field, and uploaded onto the Trimble GIS units carried daily by surveyors. In
this manner, field crews were able to precisely locate and follow the 307 foot
traverse property boundary after what was quite the technical adaptation to
promote the success of the project, and to track accurate acreages.
All high and moderate probability areas were shovel tested according to the THC
survey standards for linear survey projects, due to the predominantly linear
nature of the project (16 tests per mile per 100 foot width). The only exception
to this were two broad areas of land that were shovel tested according to the
THC acreage standards as these were broad areas of terrain (1 test every 2-3

acres depending on size of the tract). Low probability disturbed or destroyed
areas were subject to pedestrian survey, and very limited or no shovel testing. A
total of approximately 624.89 acres were surveyed. USIBWC property within
this northernmost section of the Falcon Reservoir consists primarily of Rio
Grande flood terraces in a riverine setting. These terraces are generally
frequently flooded and are often intensively vegetated, aggrading alluvial zones.
Areas immediately adjacent to the river on USIBWC property typically consisted
of a highly eroded scarp leading from the edge of intact, deep, terrace deposits
down to the current river channel. Whereas the broad river terraces away from
the channel exhibit excellent potential for buried site deposits, the narrow,
highly eroded scarp leading down to the channel, which is the immediate flood
zone, was typically severely disturbed by recent flooding and flood debris and
did not exhibit any potential for intact, buried archeological sites. This eroded
scarp aspect was compounded in many places by the presence of intensely
invasive, dense vegetation which increased the level of the disturbance to these
narrow areas. In fact, much of the northern portion of the project represented
very narrow bands of USIBWC property adjacent to the river, in frequently
flooded, heavily eroded, disturbed areas of highly invasive, 20 foot tall
vegetation.
Dr. Karbula and Brian King (Project Archeologist) supervised the pedestrian
survey and systematic placement of 263 shovel tests, the majority to one meter
in depth and all negative for cultural material. Both Dr. Karbula and Brian King
were instrumental in reconstructing an accurate electronic representation of the
307 foot property boundary to guide field investigations, when none was
provided by the USIBWC.
Since all areas with the potential for buried
archeological sites were systematically shovel tested, and no sites were present,
the only archeological or regionally specific expertise required was the
determination of which areas exhibited a high potential for sites (undisturbed)
and in the actual placement of shovel tests. Dr. Perttula was on call to
immediately conduct a field visit to evaluate any historic, Spanish Colonial,
burial or cemetery sites but this was unnecessary. No prehistoric sites were
found within project boundaries. No intact historic sites were found within
project boundaries. Generally conducting shovel tests systematically at 16 per
mile per 100 foot width, with completely negative findings, there was no need for
Dr. Perttula to conduct a site visit, to further supervise the placement of
negative shovel tests.
A single new, archeological site (41ZP924), however, was observed on private
property while achieving access to USIBWC lands. Site 41ZP924 is a probable
Late Prehistoric site observed approximately 35-40 meters east of the project
boundary 307-foot traverse taking line. The site contained lithic debitage, a
small unidentified ceramic sherd fragment, an unidentified thin biface/projectile
point, early stage bifaces, burned rock fragments, mussel shell, groundstone,
and bone fragments observed on the ground surface. Site 41ZP924 appears
eroded but has the potential to contain intact buried cultural deposits.
Report production occurred in January through June 2007. James Karbula,
Brian King and Matt Stotts are the primary authors. Kevin Contrino is credited
for the extensive GIS contribution. Cheryl Hardy is responsible for report

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located primarily in the Rio Grande Valley / South Texas
Brushlands of the Gulf Coastal Plains ecological or natural subregion. The
South Texas Brushlands occupy a large, wide, wedge-shaped plain in south
Texas below the Balcones Escarpment, east of the Rio Grande and west of the
Blackland Prairies region (Telfair 1999). The majority of the proposed project
area is undeveloped with dense vegetation (Figures 2 and 3). Most areas within
the project area are lined with mesquite-acacia savannah or south Texas
mesquite-scrub brush savannah, combined with pockets of dense bamboo
(typically over 20 feet in height). Areas adjacent to the project area are typically
cleared of all vegetation and are used as farmland. The majority of the existing
project area is located in the Rio Grande floodplain, with a small portion being
located on an adjacent terrace. The proposed project area transects three
geological formations: Alluvium, Fluviatile terrace deposits, and the Laredo
Formation. The alluvium is dominantly sand and silt deposits from frequent
flooding of the Rio Grande. The Fluviatile terrace deposits consist of gravel,
sand, silt, and clay. The Laredo Formation consists of clay and sandstone with
soil colors ranging from chocolate brown to reddish-brown (Groat 1976). To
date, there has not been a Natural Resources Conservation Service soil survey
report published for Zapata County, Texas. A typical shovel test revealed a
light-colored loamy soil over reddish or mottled clayey subsoil to a depth of 100
centimeters below the ground surface. Ground surface visibility in the proposed
project area is poor (10%), with little to no visibility observed by investigators.
The typical climate in Zapata County is a subtropical, subhumid climate with
mild winters and hot summers. Temperatures range from an average minimum
of 69Â° F in January to an average maximum of 100Â° F in July. Rainfall within
Zapata County averages 19 inches a year (Garza and Long 2001).

VEGETATION, WILDLIFE, AND LAND USE
The project is located within the South Texas Plains Vegetational Area of Texas
(Gould 1962). This region includes most of southern Texas from the Rio Grande
to the Coastal Plains and extends on an east-west line between San Antonio and
Del Rio. The climate of this region is described as subtropical steppe and is
characterized by semiarid to arid conditions (Larkin and Bomar 1983). The
vegetational structure and relative species composition of the South Texas
Plains has changed drastically over time. Historically, the dominant vegetation
types were brushy savannahs and grasslands. Increased grazing and the
cessation of fire have led to the spread of woody species from riparian areas and
ridges to all parts of the landscape (Inglis 1964). The proliferation of these
woody species has progressed to such an extent that the area is now commonly
referred to as the Brush Country of south Texas.
This vegetational area is further divided into two vegetation types as described in
âThe Vegetation Types of Texasâ (Frye 1984). These vegetation types are
Mesquite-Blackbrush Brush and Crops. The Mesquite-Blackbrush vegetation
type is principally found on shallow, gravelly or loamy soils. Examples of this
type of vegetation observed in the project area during survey include lotebush,
desert olive, allthorn, prickly pear cactus, yucca, and tasajillo. Cropland, as the
name implies, consists of cultivated cover crops or row crops providing food
and/or fiber for either man or domestic animals. This type may also portray
grassland associated with crop rotations (Frye 1984).
The fauna distributed here illuminates the transitional nature of the province.
There are considerable elements of neo-tropical species, grassland species, and

Environmental Setting

Chihuahuan desert species inhabiting the variety of habitats present. Several
species of mammals, snakes, lizards, and anurans (frogs and toads), occur, or
have recently occurred, in the Tamaulipan province. Bird life is also diverse,
with several species documented at Falcon Lake State Park, located near Falcon
Dam. Perhaps the most noteworthy example of the local wildlife observed during
the survey was a rather large western diamondback rattlesnake, encountered at
an uncomfortably close distance.
Present day land use in the region is predominantly agricultural and residential.
This includes single family residences, range land, pastureland and crops. More
urban and residential land uses are concentrated in and around the cities of
Zapata, San Ygnacio, and Laredo. Oil and gas production are found throughout
the region, often at high densities. Hunting of wildlife is of tremendous economic
importance in the region. Recreational hunting for white-tailed deer, wild hogs,
bobwhite quail, and mourning and white-winged dove bring substantial financial
benefits to the local economy.

Cultural Background

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The project corridor extends across the Rio Grande Plain biogeographical
subregion of the South Texas Plains archeological region as defined by Black
(1989). While the Rio Grande nominally defines the western and southern
border of most of this region, the river almost certainly did not function as a
cultural boundary in prehistoric times. In fact, the northeastern areas within
the Mexican states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas manifest prehistoric cultural
materials that are strikingly similar to those found in south Texas (Hester 1980).
The South Texas Plains archeological region is poorly understood, reflecting a
paucity of systematic excavations as well as the geomorphic characteristics of
the landscape as they pertain to site formation processes. The most commonly
recorded sites in south Texas are open occupation sites. In some cases,
meaningful excavation of these sites has proven to be a challenge to
archeologists (Hester 1995). This vexing situation stems from the horizontal
patterning of many open occupation sites in the region. These sites tend to exist
as laterally extensive occupation areas with temporally separated components
found across the area that are also separated horizontally and rarely overlap
(Hester 1995). Other open occupation sites, especially in upland settings, occur
on stable ancient surfaces with very shallow or deflated cultural deposits that
are virtually impossible to conclusively attribute to a particular time period.
Comparatively few deeply stratified occupation sites have been excavated in
south Texas. Black posits that this is a result of both settlement patterning and
depositional context (Black 1989). Other site types present in south Texas
include lithic procurement and reduction sites, rockshelters, artifact caches,
and burials. Lithic procurement and reduction sites are common and are
typically found in upland areas where chert resources in Uvalde gravels occur.

SOUTH TEXAS CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY
Although the South Texas Plains archeological region is a distinct entity, much
of what is known of the area is in part derived from comparisons and
extrapolation with adjacent areas that have been the subject of more intensive
investigation, particularly the central Texas archeological region. Suhm, Kriger,
and Jelks (1954) used artifact collections and other data to type artifact
assemblages corresponding to the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods as the
âFalcon Focusâ and the Mier Focusâ (Quigg and Cordova 1999). The Falcon
Focus contains archaic surficial artifacts recovered from open camp sites near
Zapata and Rosita terraces along the Rio Grande. The most common diagnostic
artifact is the unnotched triangular Tortugas dart point, in association with
large crude fist axes, triangular knives, heavy end scrapers, and gouges (Quigg
and Cordova 1999:3-2). These sites are common in south Texas and represent
an increase in population within the region.
The Mier Focus (Suhm et al. 1954) is a continuation of the earlier Falcon Focus.
The most common diagnostic artifact is the unnotched Tortugas and Abasolo
points, in addition to the smaller Matamoros and Catan arrow points. According
to Quigg and Cordova (1999:3-1-3-2) limited excavations in this region of south
Texas since the 1950âs have yet to clarify the relationship of the Falcon and Mier
foci. As in other parts of Texas, sites of the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric

Archeological Survey â Falcon Reservoir 600 Acre Survey in Zapata County, Texas â August 2007

13

Cultural Background

periods in south Texas demonstrate a radical shift in technology with the
abandonment of the dart point and gouge tool kit and adoption of arrow points
and ceramic technology. Sites tend to be more closely clustered around creek
channels.
Syntheses of the prehistory of South Texas Plains archeological region have been
formulated by Hester (1980), Hall et al. (1986), and Black (1989). More recently,
Hester (1995,2004) has refined these syntheses in a general overview of the
cultural history of the region. These syntheses provide an outline of the basic
chronological divisions. This sequence, adapted from Black (1989) and Hester
(1995), is based on four time periods roughly parallel to those found in central
Texas. These time periods include: Paleoindian (11,200-8,000 radiocarbon
years before present [B.P.]), Archaic (8,000-1,200 B.P.), Late Prehistoric (1,200Â­
400 B.P.), and Protohistoric (400-300 B.P.). Similar to the cultural chronology
provided for the central Texas archeological region, these divisions represent
contrived temporal categories, but they are also based in large part on perceived
adaptations in subsistence, and are reflected in changes in lithic and other
technologies. These technological changes further reflect changes in broader
patterns of the environment and culture.
Much of the prehistoric data on south Texas derives from Choke Canyon. There,
archeologists found sites spanning the entire spectrum of south Texas
prehistory. Only a handful of Paleoindian sites have been recorded at Choke
Canyon and these were found as shallow surface manifestations (Hall et al.
1986), suggesting that indigenous groups inhabited this region only briefly on
their way to someplace else.
Hester (1980) has suggested that another
explanation for the paucity of Paleoindian sites is that erosion and shifting river
channels have caused massive destruction of these already ephemeral remains.
The Early Archaic is likewise poorly represented at Choke Canyon, though data
collected from two carefully built stone hearths indicate that native peoples may
have relied heavily on aquatic resources or processing of plant food. This idea is
further supported by a noticeable dearth of projectile points, which would
otherwise indicate a strong reliance on hunting (Hall et al. 1986).
The
archeology of Choke Canyon suggests that during the Middle Archaic to Late
Archaic periods, the population began to steadily increase. Sites types and
artifacts increasingly demonstrate a reliance on plant foods and small mammal
consumption. The incidences of burned rock middens increase, as well as
ground stone, flake tools, and distally beveled gouges (Hall et al. 1986).

HISTORIC PERIOD
Zapata County, bordered on the north by Webb County, Jim Hogg and Starr
Counties to the east, and Mexico to the west, was named for local rancher
Antonio Zapata. Capt. Miguel de la Garza FalcÃ³n led the first European
exploration of the region in 1747, when he led a group down the northern bank
of the Rio Grande from the site of present day Eagle Pass to the mouth of the
river (Sanchez 1994; Fleming 1998; Garza and Long 2001). Although Garza
described the land as "barren, with little or no water, scanty grass...and unfit for
settlement for lack of an adequate water supply", the first settlement of Nuestra
SeÃ±ora de los Dolores Hacienda was founded in 1750, a few miles from the site
of present San Ygnacio (Garza and Long 2001). According to McCulloch et al.
(2001:62) lifestyles of local Native Americans became dominated due to the
establishment of permanent Spanish settlements in south Texas. Ranching was
the primary industry in the early years. Fleming (1998:61) states only a few

14

Cultural Background

large ranches were present along the Rio Grande, with most ranches being small
stock farms during the early Spanish settlement of south Texas. In 1821 the
future Zapata County, along with other settlements between the Nueces and the
Rio Grande, became part of the Mexican state of Tamaulipas (Garza and Long
2001).
There were numerous small groups of American Indians living in south Texas
and northeastern Mexico when Spanish explorers made contact. Salinas
(1990:93) describes how the Spanish explorers referred to the different American
Indian groups as âCarrizos.â The Carrizo groups were further distinguished by
their location to the east and west of the Rio Grande. Spanish explorers referred
to these groups as the western and eastern Carrizos groups (Salinas 1990;
Parsons 2004). Some of the American Indian settlements near the present day
Falcon Reservoir include the Malaguitas, western Carrizos, the Borrado, and the
Tepemaca (Garza and Long 1996:1143; Parsons 2004).
The Malaguitas
inhabited the area near the present day Starr and Zapata County line. The
western Carrizos inhabited the area west of the Falcon Reservoir, along the Rio
Salado east of Lampazos in Nuevo LeÃ³n. The Borrado and the Tepemaca were
documented within the regional area (Garza and Long 1996; Parsons 2004).
Claimed by both Texas and Mexico, the region was disputed territory from the
time of the Texas Revolution until the Mexican War. Despite political turmoil in
the region and continual raids by Comanches, Apaches, and other Indians, by
1848 thirty-nine porciones and 15 other tracts of land had been granted to
individuals either by Spanish authorities or by the Mexican government. In
1839, Henry Redmond (one of the earliest Anglo-Americans in the region) filed a
claim for a headright. A small settlement grew at the site that became known as
HabitaciÃ³n. This settlement was renamed Bellville in 1858, and eventually
became to be known as Zapata, the county seat of Zapata County. The county
itself was established by legislative measure on January 22, 1858, following the
1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, in which Texas laid claim to the region.
With a population of 1,248 before the Civil War, Zapata County had been known
as a haven for outlaws. âAfter the war both Mexican and American outlaws made
frequent raids on Zapata County ranches, stealing cattle and horses and
sometimes killing the occupantsâ (Garza and Long 2001). In 1875, following the
killing of several county officials, Governor Richard Coke declared that all
judicial proceedings be moved to neighboring Webb County until order could be
restored. Ranching remained the dominant occupation throughout this time,
with an increased dependence upon sheep ranching. After the 1890âs, most
ranchers had sold their sheep and replaced them with goats, which were better
adapted to the harsh climate and sparse vegetation, and by 1910, mohair
exportation was a chief source of revenue for the county. Prior to the 1900âs,
farming had been largely subsistence, led by corn production. However, the
period after 1900 saw an increased emphasis on commercial farming crops such
as cotton, with local farmers producing 2,000 bales annually by 1920.
Oil was discovered in Zapata County in 1919, and throughout the 1920âs, the
first commercial oil and gas wells were drilled. In 1931, a toll bridge was
constructed between Zapata and Guerrero (Tamaulipas, Mexico), followed by the
introduction of a water system to the county seat in 1932. A few years later,
Highway 83 connected Brownsville and Laredo, affording Zapata County access
to outside markets for the first time. Additionally, many other county roads
were graded and improved. As the county was beginning to boom the Great
Depression hit, and as with most other Texas counties, Zapata County farmers

Cultural Background

suffered from falling crop and livestock prices. Following World War II, ranching
once again emerged as the dominant industry. Many other important changes
took place during the postwar years in Zapata County, including the
construction of the Falcon Reservoir. The planning stages for the project were
initiated in the late 1940âs and to oversee the efforts, the International Boundary
and Water Commission was formed. The selection of the Starr/Zapata County
line for the dam location meant that more than 115,000 acres in Zapata County
would be inundated (Garza and Long 2001; McCulloch et al. 2001).
Nevertheless, the Falcon Reservoir provided a boom to the countyâs economy,
fostering tourism, which was one of the county's largest sources of income by
the 1960âs. Lakeshore developments became the focus of both commercial and
social activity and for the next three decades, tourism, ranching, oil, and gas
were the Zapata Countyâs leading industries (Garza and Long 2001).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Many of the earlier details regarding archeological investigation in the Falcon
Reservoir prior to impoundment have not been published (Parsons 2002). There
are several summaries of these earlier investigations prepared by Krieger and
Hughes (1950), Hartle and Stephenson (1951), Cason (1952), and Jelks (1952,
1953). The majority of these intensive surveys were conducted as salvage
investigations as part of the National Park Service River Basin Surveys program
prior to construction of the Falcon Dam. Previous archeological investigations
conducted between 1953 and 1998 have been summarized by McCulloch and
Warren (1998). Cultural resources surveys conducted after the construction of
the Falcon Dam are limited to surveys including pipelines, conduct of seismic
surveys, and support to the USIBWC in their management responsibilities
(Parsons 2002). A summary of previous investigations within the Falcon
Reservoir after inundation on behalf of the USIBWC follows.
In 1991, TRC Mariah Associates conducted the first archeological investigations
within the Falcon Reservoir for the USIBWC. Twenty-one prehistoric sites were
recorded during the survey (OâNeill et al. 1992). From 1992-1995, Archaeology
Consultants, Inc. conducted archeological investigations for several seismic
studies for pipeline installation and the construction of a boat ramp (Warren
1992, 1993, 1994, 1995; Houk and Warren 1994; McCulloch and Warren
1995a, 1995b). In 1999, Quigg and Cordova (1999) of TRC Mariah Associates,
Inc. conducted monitoring and test excavations at two sites (41ZP39 and
41ZP176) originally recorded by McCulloch and Warren (1995b).
In 1996, Perttula et al., conducted an assessment of the threatened prehistoric
and historic archeological resources at the Falcon Reservoir. The assessment
consisted of reconnaissance surveys by representatives from the SHPO, the
National Park Service, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory of the University of Texas at Austin, and the
South Texas Archeological Association. The goal of the study was to assess the
condition and National Register eligibility of archeological sites exposed by
severe drought in areas along the shoreline that were normally inundated by
Falcon Reservoir. The survey resulted in the documentation of 97 previously
unrecorded archeological sites and the reinvestigation of 13 previously recorded
archeological and architectural sites. Perttula et al., (1996) recommended that
sites 41ZP79, 41ZP87, 41ZP276, 41ZP278, 41ZP280, 41ZP281, 41ZP285,
41ZP295, 41ZP302, 41ZP316, 41ZP317, 41ZP318, 41ZP319, 41ZP320,
41ZP328, and 41ZP359 meet criteria A, C, or D of the NRHP, while sites

41ZP299, 41ZP300, 41ZP314, and 41ZP327 meet criteria A and C.
In 1996, Archaeology Consultants, Inc. conducted the largest survey to date
within the Falcon Reservoir. Investigators conducted a reconnaissance survey
for nine large parcels of land in support of a seismic survey line study. An
approximate total of 28,175 acres were surveyed during this investigation. The
survey consisted of reconnaissance survey only, with no subsurface testing
being conducted. The survey resulted in 60 previously recorded sites being
reassessed and 351 newly recorded archeological sites. Only preliminary
potential for listing in the NRHP was assessed for each site. None of the sites
were fully assessed for NRHP eligibility (McCulloch et al. 2003).
From 1997-2000, TRC Mariah Associates, Inc. conducted cultural resource
investigations for a pipeline and the salvage of four additional prehistoric sites,
in the Mustang project area (Lintz and Quigg 1997). The sites dated from the
Early Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods. These investigations led to a
data recovery for Site 41ZP364 (Quigg and Cordova 2000).
In 2001, Parsons and LOPEZGARCIA GROUP (2002) (previously known as
Wendy Lopez & Associates, Inc.), conducted survey in two designated areas
within the Falcon Reservoir: the Central Unsurveyed Area (CUA) and the
Northern Unsurveyed Area (NUA). A total of 2,486 acres were surveyed during
the reconnaissance survey, with a total of 144 archeological sites being newly
recorded. In result, 58 sites were recommended as not eligible to be listed in the
NRHP, while 27 sites were recommended eligible to the NRHP; the remaining 59
sites were unidentified sites and were recommended for further investigation to
determine site integrity and eligibility to the NRHP (Parsons and LOPEZGARCIA
GROUP 2002).
In 2003, Parsons and LOPEZGARCIA GROUP conducted an archeological
reconnaissance survey of a total of 2,002 acres within the Northern Unsurveyed
Area (NUA) and the Central Unsurveyed Area (CUA) (Parsons 2004). Forty-nine
previously unrecorded archeological sites were recorded and four previously
recorded sites were revisited (41ZP3, 41ZP81, 41ZP82, and 41ZP812). Of the 53
sites, 46 are prehistoric, three are historic, and four are multi-component. The
numbers of fire-cracked-rock hearths at the sites varied considerably and
ranged from a low count of a single hearth at seven sites to a high count of 15
hearths at 41ZP846. In addition to the recorded hearth features, two sites
contain flake cluster features (41ZP854, 41ZP863) and a charcoal and bone-rich
soil zone was recorded at one site (41ZP845). Diagnostic projectile point forms
recovered from these sites include Abasolo, Tortugas, Matamoros, and Starr
types.
In 2005, Hicks & Company (H&C) conducted a combination intensive and
reconnaissance pedestrian survey of approximately 403 acres along the Falcon
Lake shoreline in Zapata and Starr Counties, Texas, on behalf of the USIBWC
(Karbula et al. 2006). The project also included salvage investigations at Site
41ZP845. The project area consisted of two selected sections of roughly
equivalent size in each of the Northern and Central Unsurveyed Areas (NUA,
CUA).
Project areas were classified apriori as high, moderate, and low
probability based on a number of criteria. High and some moderate probability
areas were subject to 100% pedestrian survey with shovel testing according to

Cultural Background

the THC minimum acreage survey standards. Low probability areas were
subject to pedestrian survey with no subsurface shovel testing.
A total of 178 acres were surveyed and 73 shovel tests excavated in the NUA.
Two prehistoric and one historic archeological site were recorded in or
immediately adjacent to the NUA (41ZP919, 41ZP920, and 41ZP921). There
were no previously recorded archeological sites located within the NUA project
area. Prehistoric site 41ZP921 was recommended for further investigations
(additional cultural resource coordination and formal testing) to determine its
eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). No further work or
coordination was recommended for 41ZP920. Investigators believe Site 41ZP919
was possibly an extension of Site 41ZP82, the Rancho Rincon, a ca. 1860
archeological site originally recorded during the Parsons reconnaissance survey
(2004). Site 41ZP919 was recommended for further evaluation, in relation to
41ZP82 to determine NRHP eligibility.
A total of 197 acres were surveyed and 22 shovel tests excavated in the CUA.
The survey resulted in the documentation of a single previously unidentified
archeological site (41ZP922). In addition, there were 15 previously recorded
sites subject to revisits (41ZP183, 41ZP724, 41ZP727, 41ZP733, 41ZP734,
41ZP735, 41ZP736, 41ZP753, 41ZP755, 41ZP758, 41ZP759, 41ZP760,
41ZP761, 41ZP763 and 41ZP764) within the CUA project area. Attempts were
made to revisit all 15 sites. Site 41ZP755, a multi-component site recorded in
the CUA, was not relocated.
No further work or cultural resource coordination was recommended for the
exposed portions of Sites 41ZP727, 41ZP733, 41ZP761, 41ZP763, and 41ZP764.
The exposed portions of these sites were recommended as ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP.
The inundated portions of these sites, however, were
recommended for further assessment should lake levels decline.
Sites 41ZP724, 41ZP736, 41ZP753 and 41ZP758 were recommended as
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. These sites are the remains of surficial
Uvalde gravel lithic workshops. These sites appear to no longer exist. No
further work or cultural resource coordination was recommended for these sites.
The Texas SHPO, however, requested further information for Sites 41ZP736,
41ZP753, and 41ZP758 in order to determine NRHP eligibility.
The Texas SHPO subsequently reviewed, commented and concurred with the
recommendations on all but three sites. Further information was requested on
Sites 41ZP736, 41ZP753, and 41ZP758 (letter dated May 6, 2006), which is
presented in the final survey report for these investigations (Karbula et al. 2006).
The survey and revisit salvage investigation of Site 41ZP845 included a site
revisit, 100% pedestrian survey (27.2 acres) and salvage of two prehistoric
hearth features. Although hundreds of feature remnants were present within
the site boundaries, investigators determined that the site lacked good research
potential. It was estimated that 95% of the exposed feature remnants were
completely eroded and disturbed. No diagnostic artifacts and little organic
preservation were recovered during testing excavations. The overall context of
the site was one of erosion and disturbance. Site 41ZP845 was recommended
by investigators as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and no further work or
cultural resource coordination was recommended. The Texas SHPO, however,
recommended further investigation for any intact site areas at 41ZP845 that
may have the potential to contain buried features. As a result, further cultural

resource coordination is required related to any future Federal undertakings or
State sponsored activities at Site 41ZP845.
The goal of the current project was to continue survey efforts within the Falcon
Dam and Reservoir Project Area.
Prior to initiating the current field
investigations, a search of records on the online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas,
maintained by the Texas Historical Commission (THC), was conducted within a
two-kilometer buffer radius to determine if any previously recorded archeological
sites or surveys were recorded or conducted in the study area.
According to the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, a single archeological survey
has been conducted within the two kilometer buffer zone around the Falcon
Reservoir 600 Acre Survey in Zapata County. Between June and September of
2003, Blanton and Associates conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the
proposed improvements to US 83 in Zapata and Starr Counties (Meadows et. al.
2005). This survey identified 40 new sites and revisited nine previously recorded
sites. Pertinent to the project under discussion are nine sites recorded during
the course of the US 83 survey that fall within the two kilometer buffer zone:
41ZP150, 41ZP191, 41ZP886, 41ZP887, 41ZP888, 41ZP889, 41ZP890,
41ZP891, and 41ZP892. Of these sites, only three â 41ZP150, 41ZP191, and
41ZP890 - were deemed as requiring further investigation to determine NRHP
eligibility. The remainder was determined ineligible for NRHP nominations or
designations as State Archeological Landmarks (SAL). The spatial relationships
of Sites 41ZP191, 889, and 890 to the current project are discussed in the
Executive Summary and Results of Field Investigations sections.
Site 41ZP150 was first identified by William E. Moore as a scatter of debitage
and possible cores of unknown age. Following a 2003 revisit by Blanton &
Associates archeologists, they recommended that the site required further
investigation to determine if it was eligible as an NRHP or SAL. 41ZP191 was
first recorded by James B. Boyd of the South Texas Archeological Association in
1988. He defined the site as a multi-component prehistoric campsite dating
between the Early Archaic and the Late Prehistoric periods.
Temporal
placement was based on the recovery of nine projectile points including Perdiz,
Caracara, Young, Matamoros, and Tortugas types. In addition, other stone
tools, debitage, burned rock, mussel and snail shell were recorded as abundant
and associated with hearth features eroding from the surface. When the site
was resurveyed by Blanton & Associates archeologists in 2003, they
encountered burned rock, debitage and stone tool fragments up to a meter in
depth, but did not recover additional diagnostic artifacts. Blanton & Associates
investigators suggested that additional research was reasonable and felt that
NRHP eligibility would need to be assessed with additional investigation.
41ZP890 is a scatter of burned rock, chert debitage and two biface fragments
associated with a single large hearth feature. Deposits ranged from 20 to 80
centimeters in depth, but no diagnostic artifacts were identified to date the site.
Investigators stated the potential for more buried deposits and recommended
that additional investigation would be necessary to make a determination if the
site was NRHP or SAL eligible.
41ZP886 was identified as a prehistoric site of unknown age located on the
surface and extending to a depth of 45 centimeters below the surface. Artifacts
recorded included debitage and burned rock, but no features or diagnostic
artifacts were identified. No additional investigation was recommended for this
site. A sparse amount of chert debitage and burned rock found on the surface
and between 10-40 centimeters below the surface was identified as site

Archeological Survey â Falcon Reservoir 600 Acre Survey in Zapata County, Texas â August 2007

19

Cultural Background

41ZP887. No diagnostic artifacts or intact features were found. The area within
the project right-of-way was deemed of low research value and additional
investigations were not recommended. 41ZP888 is a low-density prehistoric site
of unknown age. Artifacts recovered on the surface and to a depth of 50
centimeters below the surface were found to be in disturbed contexts and to lack
any intact feature associations. Investigators deemed the site too disturbed (at
least within the project ROW), to warrant further investigation or NRHP or SAL
nomination. 41ZP889 consisted of a shallow deposit (0-30 centimeters below
surface) of burned rock, debitage and biface fragments. No diagnostics artifacts
were located. Archeologists noted that the site was heavily disturbed from the
construction of US 83 and utility lines, and did not warrant further research as
it lacked a potential for intact buried components. 41ZP891 is a prehistoric site
of unknown age consisting of a scatter of lithic debitage, burned rock and
mussel shell in the upper 50 centimeters of deposits. The recorders indicated
that the site was disturbed and did not warrant further investigation within the
project ROW. Finally, site 41ZP892 is a poorly preserved site with debitage and
burned rock located on the surface and in the upper 20 centimeters of deposits
below the surface. No further investigation was recommended for this site.
In addition to the sites listed above, five additional archeological sites were
located within the two kilometer project area buffer zone. These sites may have
been recorded as part of the original ca. 1950 National Park Service River Basin
Surveys of the Falcon Reservoir, though information is scant (Krieger and
Hughes 1950), or by avocational archeologists. These include the Corralitos
Ranch (41ZP74), a NRHP listed property. When originally listed in 1977, the site
was identified as the location of a historic period ranch and farmstead occupied
from 1849-1899. Subsequent archival and archeological investigation by
Fleming and Perttula (1999), clarified that the site was the location of the mid
18th century settlement by JosÃ© Fernando Vidaurri of his grandfather Jose
VÃ¡squez Borregoâs 1750 land grant by the Spanish government. The site
structures include the remains of the original fortaleza constructed by 1786 and
later 19th century ranch buildings. Field crews drove through the Corralitos
Ranch to access USIBWC lands. All of the ranch structures are a considerable
distance from the current project area.
Sites 41ZP77, 41ZP78, 41ZP96 and 41ZP35 are also within the two kilometer
buffer zone. No records pertaining to Site 41ZP77 are available on the THC
Historic Sites Atlas. Site 41ZP77 is apparently listed on the National Register
listings of the Texas Historical Commission as a Spanish Colonial (1750-1799)
domestic, agriculture site with data potential including architecture. In her
unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Mary Jo Galindo (2003:12) identified the site as
the location of Old Dolores, a ranch within the boundaries of the Nuestra SeÃ±ora
de los Dolores hacienda. The site is located on a high terrace overlooking the
project. The site does not overlap the project area.
Galindo (2003:12) also identified site 41ZP78 as another Spanish Colonial ranch
site on the Dolores hacienda, known simply as Dolores. According to the Texas
Historic Sites Atlas, when the site was identified during the National Park
Service River Basin Survey, the recorders identified this same site as Dolores
Viejo and collected 60 potsherds, one gouge, two dart points and a copper strip.
The site is located on a high terrace overlooking the project area. The site does
not overlap the project area.
In fact, Sites 41ZP74 (Corralitos Ranch), 41ZP77 (Old Dolores, Rancho Dolores)
and 41ZP78 (Dolores, Nuevo Dolores), all appear part of the original Ca. 1750

Cultural Background

Hacienda de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de los Dolores founded as part of JosÃ© VÃ¡squez
Borregoâs land grant from the Spanish government. The Hacienda and these
ranch settlements are considered to be the first Spanish Colonial venture on the
north bank of the Rio Grande. All of this early Spanish settlement occurred on
the higher terrace overlooking the immediate Rio Grande floodplain. The
structures had to be built on higher topography to withstand Rio Grande floods.
Any related structures or remains in the immediate floodplain would have long
since been destroyed. These early Spanish settlements do not overlap the
narrow USIBWC project area, as the sites are currently mapped, and from field
observation and shovel testing.
A historic 1936 Centennial marker denotes the location of a possible âMission
Dolores a Visitaâ. The marker is mapped along unsettled portions of Arroyo
Dolores according to the THC Atlas. However, the marker appears to reside
along US 83 at Arroyo Dolores, and is believed to reference the nearby
community of Old Dolores or Rancho Dolores (41ZP77). The Handbook of Texas
Online indicates there was never any mission in this area. The marker is
outside of the project area.
For the final site, 41ZP96, no information is available concerning the temporal
placement or type of site represented. As mapped on the Archeological Sites
Atlas, the boundaries of 41ZP96 overlap the western edge of the project area.
Site 41ZP35 is a multi-component artifact scatter located on an upland ridge
along US 83 approximately 250 meters west of Arroyo Dolores. The prehistoric
component at the site consists of a Tortugas dart point, chert debitage, and
burned rock to a depth of 60 centimeters below ground surface. The historic
component is confined to the surface and consists of a scatter of untyped glazed
ceramics. The site was originally recorded in 1950 and revisited in 2003 by
Blanton & Associates, Inc. as part of their survey of US 83. Limited archival
research revealed two structures were present on a 1931 Corps of Engineers
map and a later 1936 highway map of Zapata County. The most recent survey
does not report the presence of any structures. Based on the assemblage
reported by Blanton & Associates, Inc., the prehistoric component likely dates to
the Late Middle Archaic and the historic component likely dates to the early
20th century. Blanton & Associates, Inc. recommends additional survey and
archival research for the site. The site does not overlap the boundaries of the
current project area.

Methodology

METHODOLOGY
METHODS USED TO MAP 307- FOOT TRAVERSE TAKING LINE
The 307-foot traverse taking line of the proposed study area was incorporated
into the existing ArcView Geographic Information System (GIS) maps and the
Trimble XT Global Positioning System (GPS) unit. The purpose of this effort was
to provide investigators with a planning and management tool prior to survey
and so the field survey crew could accurately relocate the 307-foot traverse
during survey. The 307-foot traverse line consists of a series of straight lines
that approximate the 307-foot elevation contour line, respectively. Lands
managed by the USIBWC above the 307-foot traverse taking line were not
identified nor included in the current cultural resources survey.
The 307-foot taking line was compiled from three sources: real property maps
from the USIBWC Falcon Reservoir Field Office in Falcon Heights, Texas; on site
location of the 307-foot traverse taking line in specific areas by Mr. Raul Garcia,
the Falcon Lease and License Manager, and hand written U.S. State Plane
coordinates of the original survey of the 307-foot traverse taking line. An
attempt to relocate the original 307-taking line survey monuments during
survey was unsuccessful. No single source was complete, but all these variables
together were used to supplement each other to reconstruct a complete 307-foot
traverse taking line for the study area (see Plates 1 â 7).
The USIBWC real property maps were not complete, and lacked spatial
reference. The USIBWC real property maps for the project area stored at the
USIBWC Falcon Field Office, in Falcon Heights, Texas were in relatively good
condition. The journal log with the hand written U.S. State Plane coordinates,
however, was in poor condition with certain sections unreadable. Investigators
use Index maps from the Government Furnished Materials (GFM) to obtain the
map identification source codes for the current study area. Unfortunately, some
maps were missing that were shown on the larger area index map for the project
area. Hand written state plane coordinates were compiled for the missing map
segments.
On the ground GPS coordinates, obtained in the field, provided necessary
ground control points to georeference the real property maps. The GPS unit
used on the survey was the Trimble Geo XT. This GPS system utilizes
differential correction to allow for sub-meter accuracy.
The differential
correction process began with field collection of the data, and the field data was
âpost processedâ, or correlated with a stationary receiver, often called a "base
station." The base station data corrected positioning errors of the field data.
Since none of the survey monuments were found to be intact, investigators used
the original Falcon real property maps and U.S. state plane coordinates, as well
as personal knowledge from Mr. Garcia to project the 307-foot traverse taking
line on 2004 infrared aerial photography and 7.5 minute USGS topography
maps. With a set of georeferenced real property maps, the 307-foot taking line
was extracted and saved as an Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.
(ESRI) shapefile. The shapefile was imported into the Trimble GPS unit allowing
investigators to know precisely where the 307-foot traverse taking line was
located during survey.

Methodology

PROBABILITY AREAS
Field methods were guided by determinations of high, moderate and low
probability areas.
Survey investigations effectively ground-truthed these
determinations. Low probability disturbed and destroyed areas consisted of the
immediate areas adjacent to the shoreline. These areas consisted of eroded, Rio
Grande terrace remnants often in the form of steep scarps or low lying areas
clearly scoured by recent flooding and further disturbed by invasive, dense
vegetation. Often these areas were littered with sizeable debris from recent
flooding. These areas are subject to a violent combination of immediate flooding
and scour by the current Rio Grande. In the southern project area, the T1
terrace is approximately 2-3 meters above the modern channel but characterized
by a steep eroded scarp adjacent and leading down to the river. In the central
and north-central project area, the T1 terraces are much more narrow remnants
and much more disturbed due to sheetwash and erosional drainages impacting
the sediments resulting from narrowing of the Rio Grande valley walls in higher
elevations upstream. The Rio Grande appears constrained within approximately
the 320 foot elevation line on both sides of the river. In the north project area,
the valley walls narrow and the river has a much more constrained axis to
deposit flood sediments. On the U.S. side, the river is constrained laterally by
steep topography. In the narrow valley, flood sediments are probably quickly
deposited, and just as quickly eroded away by gulleys and sheetwash from the
adjacent hills. This erosional aspect is compounded by frequent flooding and
even scouring having a measurable negative effect on the contextual integrity of
the deposits. Even in northern areas that exhibit somewhat wider terrace
remnants extending east and away from the river, it is clear from observation
that the majority of these are frequently flooded, scoured, and dissected by
erosional gulleys funneling run-off from the adjacent and much closer T2
terrace. In the extreme northern project area, steep slopes and heavily eroded
terrain characterized the narrow project corridor. Large portions of the linear
survey areas within the 307 foot traverse taking line are located entirely within
the immediate flood and scour zone of the current Rio Grande (T1 scarp in the
south, terrace remnants and heavily eroded steep slopes in the north).
These areas were identified as having a low probability for intact buried
prehistoric sites due to the nature of the highly eroded, scoured scarp, often at
slopes greater than 20 percent (T1), or because of the degraded terrace
remnants, and also due to extremely eroded, steep slopes in the northern project
area, all of which represent the highly dynamic, active zone of the modern
channel. Movement of the river is constrained laterally by rising topography at
higher elevations and there is much less flat, level topography for the deposition
of flood sediments. In these areas, narrow terrace deposits are frequently
impacted by additional flooding and scour from the river moving at high velocity
through the narrow channel. This, in combination with erosion from the
adjacent hills, results in terrace remnants, which are highly dynamic zones of
the active channel. In these areas, terrace remnants probably represent very
recent flood sediments subject to dual erosion from the hills and from additional
flooding.
The context of the scarp, terrace remnants and steep slopes is further
compromised through disturbance introduced by highly invasive, thick woody
and bamboo vegetation. Bamboo stalks numbered in the thousands in some
places, were closely spaced together, and generally each 10-15 centimeters in

Archeological Survey â Falcon Reservoir 600 Acre Survey in Zapata County, Texas â August 2007

Methodology

diameter, and fully 20 or more feet tall. The density of large cane stalks in
some of these areas is such that sediments are surely disturbed to the depth of
the bamboo vegetation (Figure 4). The associated root disturbance must have
had a significant effect on sediment context, and resulted in displaced sediments
to the depths of the roots.

Figure 4: Photograph of density of bamboo in some project locations.
Other areas considered low probability were typically adjacent to small drainage
tributaries of the Rio Grande, having a slope greater than 20 percent, and
evidence of a high degree of human or natural disturbance. These areas appear
as small finger ravines and were essentially erosional drainages leading down to
the current shoreline. Approximately 265.34 acres were considered completely
disturbed and were identified as having a low probability for buried cultural
resources based on the above criteria. These areas were subject to pedestrian
survey and field observation with limited or no shovel testing. Limited shovel
testing was conducted at some locations to confirm sub-surface conditions.
Further inland and in the south project area, high probability areas consisted of
an intact, relatively deep (ca. 2-3 m), heavily vegetated Rio Grande terrace
deposit extending away from the shoreline for a considerable distance (Plates 1
and 2). In the southern project area the Rio Grande Valley begins to widen
which allows the river to meander and create wider floodplain deposits. This
broad Rio Grande terrace graded into a higher terrace with distance away from
the river (T2), in the wider southern Rio Grande valley setting. The T2 terrace is
predominantly located outside of the 307 foot traverse taking line boundary and
thus not part of the current project, and probably representative of a much
older, and higher landform.
The southern T1 terrace is much lower in
topography and elevation than the adjacent T2 terrace, which is probably a
much older landform. The majority of the Spanish Colonial ranches and
prehistoric sites are located on the much higher T2 landform overlooking the Rio

Methodology

Grande from a considerable distance (see below). Neither historic or prehistoric
settlement was favorable in the active floodplain.
The topography adjacent to the Rio Grande shoreline varied from the south to
the north. The southern area was more flat with wider pockets of cleared
vegetation surrounded by dense forested areas (T1). Area 1 and Area 2 contain
these types of terrain and vegetation (Figures 5 and 6). These areas were
identified as high and moderate probability. Approximately 359.55 acres was
considered to have a high and/or moderate probability for intact buried cultural
resources; these areas were subject to systematic hand excavated shovel testing.

Areas to the north contained narrow strips of disturbed terrace remnants in
areas of increasing elevation (Figure 7). The northern terminus project area is
characterized by steep, highly eroded, heavily vegetated scarps descending
directly into the Rio Grande. Approximately 265.34 acres were considered
completely disturbed and were identified as having a low probability for buried
cultural resources based on the above criteria. These areas were subject to
pedestrian survey and field observation with limited or no shovel testing.

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
INTENSIVE SURVEY
Prior to the start of survey, the Principal Investigator and Project Archeologist
met with USIBWC officials to obtain a copy of the original survey maps of the
307-foot traverse taking line prior to the construction of the Falcon Reservoir.
An electronic copy of these maps was e-mailed to Hicks & Company GIS staff in
Austin, Texas. GIS personnel projected the 307-foot traverse taking line onto
field maps and created a GIS shapefile that could be imported into the Trimble
XT GPS unit. Field maps and data files with the 307-foot traverse line were
promptly sent to the Project Archeologist in the field. Archeologists used the
Trimble XT GPS unit to navigate the project area and accurately located the 307Â­
foot traverse taking line on the ground.
The field survey started at the southern terminus of the project area (Plate 1).
Archeologists continued surveying the proposed project area in a northerly
direction ending at the northern terminus, the Zapata and Webb County line.
Archeologists surveyed approximately 624.89 acres within the proposed
USIBWC study area. The project area is depicted on Plates 1 â 7. A total of 263
shovel tests were excavated along the project corridor, with all being negative for
cultural resources.
Hicks & Company personnel walked systematic transects parallel to the existing
Falcon Reservoir shoreline to investigate project areas for cultural material.
Shovel tests were distributed at approximately 100-meter (325 feet) intervals,
approximately 16 per mile, in only those areas having a high and moderate
probability for cultural resources, except in two areas (Area 1 and Area 2)
located in the southern portion of the project area (Plates 1 and 3); these areas
were subject to the THC minimum acreage standards for archeological survey.
When multiple transects were necessary to obtain coverage along linear portions
of the project area, investigators incorporated additional transects at 25-meter
wide intervals.
All shovel tests were terminated at a depth of 100 centimeters below ground
surface. All excavated soil was screened through Â¼-inch wire mesh. Each
shovel test was recorded in 10-centimeter levels on standardized forms and
plotted onto a site sketch map and/or an aerial photograph of the project area.
Universal Transverse-Mercator (UTM) coordinates were obtained for all
excavated shovel tests and for the endpoints of pedestrian and disturbed areas.
The walls and bottom of each shovel test were cleaned with a trowel to examine
the stratigraphy and any evidence of historic and prehistoric activity; a soil
profile was recorded for each shovel test. Once these data were recorded, all of
the shovel tests were backfilled.
The results of each shovel test were
documented through standardized forms, field notes, and photographs. Areas of
disturbance were noted and recorded through photographs.
No archeological cultural material was recovered within the proposed project
area. A typical shovel test revealed a light-colored loamy soil over reddish or
mottled clayey subsoil to a depth of 100 centimeters below the ground surface.
Ground surface visibility in the proposed project area is poor (10%), with little to
no visibility observed by investigators. Navigation along the proposed project
corridor was guided by a Trimble XT GPS unit and detailed 1950âs survey maps

plotted on aerial maps by Hicks & Company GIS personnel.

AREAS 1 AND 2
Areas 1 and 2 in the southern portion of the project were accessed through two
roads or gates of the Corralitos Ranch off US 83, and by a caliche road through
an open field to the north off US 83, near an unnamed drainage. The field crew
drove through and by the NRHP listed groups of Spanish Colonial ranch
buildings of the Corralitos Ranch and structures to access USIBWC property
(41ZP74). Site 41ZP74 and the historic elements of the Corralitos Ranch are
located approximately 750 feet east of the USIBWC project area. Both access
points were drivable all the way to the USIBWC property.
Areas 1 and 2 and areas in between in the southern portion of the project were
identified as high and moderate probability zones due to their broad width
containing intact Rio Grande terrace sediments (Plates 1 and 2). Area 1
consisted of a steep eroded scarp heavily vegetated with bamboo along the rivers
edge grading into a broad Holocene age terrace deposit extending to the east
(Figure 8). Although the scarp exhibited little potential for intact cultural
material due to severe erosion of the slope, the broad terrace was approximately
three meters deep and exhibited excellent potential for buried archeological
deposits. Figures 4 and 5 depict the typical vegetation and broad relatively
level terrace deposits within Area 1 and Area 2. Area 1 appears relatively
maintained by the USIBWC.

Figure 8: Broad Rio Grande terrace deposits in Area 1 extending away from river and
scarp to the east.
Area 2 was identified as moderate probability. Area 2 contained broad, level two
to three meter deep terrace deposits in its central and eastern portions but is
severely disturbed along the riverâs edge and in several low lying areas that may
represent previous pond or flood deposits (Figure 9). The areas adjacent to the

Archeological Survey â Falcon Reservoir 600 Acre Survey in Zapata County, Texas â August 2007

Results of Field Investigations

river in Area 2 represent low lying, frequently flooded, heavily eroded, highly
disturbed areas. In fact all of Area 2 appears to be a low lying frequently flooded
zone with the upper sediments subjected to both sediment deposition and scour
probably at regular intervals. There are pockets of disturbance in multiple areas
of Area 2. It is therefore identified as moderate probability. Area 2 contained
severe strands of invasive bamboo along the rivers edge, along its central
portion, and at its northern and southern locations (Figures 10 and 11). While
even a backhoe would face a formidable challenge in penetrating these areas for
subsurface testing, there is plenty of available surface area in Area 2 for
mechanical testing, should it be warranted.

Figure 11: Crew members traverse dense bamboo in Area 2.
Areas to the north and south of Area 2 were hummocky, heavily eroded, with
multiple erosional gulleys and intensely vegetated (Figure 12). These areas were
identified as low probability (Plates 2 and 3). A lengthy linear stretch in
between Areas 1 and 2 is identified as high probability. Although the zone
contains pockets of disturbance, the area consists of two to three meter deep
Holocene terrace deposits, as illustrated in Figure 13, where the terrace
deposits are evident at the confluence of an unnamed drainage and the Rio
Grande (facing SW). To the northeast within this unnamed drainage, the project

area climbed significantly in elevation and topography. Because the visible
portions of USIBWC property along this drainage were determined to be highly
erosional and unlikely to contain intact archeological deposits, surveyors did not
investigate this drainage beyond approximately 200 meters east of the Rio
Grande River (Plate 2). Thus, the portion within the 307 foot traverse taking
line along this unnamed drainage extending to US 83 was not surveyed, due to
observations of steep slopes, erosional surfaces, and a lack of Holocene
depositional context.

Results of Field Investigations

High and moderate probability Areas 1 and 2 were systematically shovel tested
by one test every two acres (Area 1) and one test every three acres (Area 2),
according to parcel size. The linear moderate probability zone in between was
shovel tested at 16 tests per mile (Plates 1 and 2). Area 1 totaled approximately
102.82 acres and was subject to the minimum acreage survey standards of one
shovel test for every two acres (79 tests). Area 2 totaled approximately 144.37
acres in size allowing investigators to apply the minimum survey acreage
standards of one shovel test for every three acres (56 tests).

ARROYO DOLORES
The long linear project area located between Area 2 and Arroyo Dolores was
accessed through two caliche roads off US 83, one through a plowed field just
north of Area 2, and the second through an open and plowed field just south of
Arroyo Dolores (Plates 3-5). The first access point was drivable all the way to
the 307 foot traverse line and beyond, nearly to the river. This access drive
passed through Site 41ZP96, the remnants of which are visible on aerial
photography (Plate 3). Site 41ZP96 is recorded in the central project area
overlapping with the 307 foot traverse taking line boundary. Other than
location, there are no records of this site on the Texas Historic Sites Atlas, or in
the Government Furnished Materials (GFM) or online, and no further
information could be obtained. Based on the extant topographic maps, this may
have been the location of a number of possible historic age buildings. Field
crews drove and walked through this area but observed no historic structures
that warranted archeological investigation. This area is currently the location of
several surface encumbrances including residential and industrial structures, a
pump house (located near the edge of the upper terrace), and a large amount of
heavy farming equipment, and was therefore identified as disturbed and
destroyed by modern development. Further modification of the ground surface
is attributed to heavy and repeated vehicular traffic, which has resulted in the
formation of several traffic loops around the small complex of structures and
equipment. There appears to be no intact archeological or structural elements
to the site.
Approximately 3000 linear feet were identified as moderate probability area just
north of Area 2. This area is north and west of an identified heavily disturbed
area along the east edge of the 307 foot traverse line. Surveyors report being
unable to move farther south from the access point, due âto a wall of bambooâ.
The moderate probability area to the north was identified based on survey and
observation of the terrace situation at the rivers edge. The portion of the project
within the 307 foot traverse line between Area 2 and Arroyo Dolores is
predominantly linear and very narrow (75-150 feet). The immediate terrace at
this location is approximately two meters above the river. The area contained by
the 307 foot traverse taking line boundary at this juncture typically represents
the immediate flood zone of the river, highly disturbed and eroded. Numerous
naturally and historically disturbed areas were identified along this alignment
(Figure 14). The area was identified as moderate probability and shovel tested
due to the depth of the terrace deposits along this stretch.

Results of Field Investigations

Figure 14: Historic disturbance north of Area 2.
Only limited shovel tests were conducted in the low probability area identified
between the previous moderate probability area the entire distance up and into
Arroyo Dolores (Plates 3-5). Areas south of Arroyo Dolores within the 307 foot
traverse line consisted of two aspects related to narrowing of the Rio Grande
valley walls and a general increase in elevations with distance to the north of the
project area. The primary topographic setting mid-distance between Area 2 and
Arroyo Dolores consisted of low lying, frequently inundated, heavily eroded
terrace remnants at the base of relatively steep, highly eroded slopes. Terrace
remnants were much more infrequent and narrow in this central portion of the
project and more heavily eroded due to narrowing of the valley walls, incision of
the Rio Grande at the base of the valley wall, associated erosion of remaining
intact terrace sediments, and also close proximity to nearby steep upland slopes
of the T2 terrace. With the narrowing of the valley, terrace remnants were much
more highly subjected to sheetwash, gulley formation, and erosion, from the
higher elevations, and still were subject to frequent inundation, flooding and
scouring from the Rio Grande. The combination of these factors yielded highly
disturbed terrace remnants with a low probability for intact buried cultural
materials, and was compounded by highly invasive vegetation. The immediate
floodplain contact with the river at the access point approximately 2000 feet
south of Arroyo Dolores was described as low lying, frequently inundated,
heavily eroded terrace remnant no more than 15 meters wide. Although some of
these terrace remnants may have contained deep Holocene sediments, there
would typically not be sufficient spatial area to conduct mechanical subsurface
testing and machine access would be extremely problematic, if not impossible.
Low probability determinations on terrace remnants also took terrace size and
access factors into account. The sloping surfaces at these locations graded into
low lying, narrow, disturbed flood zone areas, or straight into the Rio Grande.
Closer to Arroyo Dolores, some areas contained no terrace remnants at all and
simply represented a riverine setting between relatively steep erosional scarps.
The project area at this location was narrow and primarily located on the edge of

Archeological Survey â Falcon Reservoir 600 Acre Survey in Zapata County, Texas â August 2007

Results of Field Investigations

the eroded scarp leading down to the river (Figure 15). The slopes increased in
grade with the approach to Arroyo Dolores. Areas south of the creek within the
narrow, river side project area were quite steep erosional surfaces (Figure 16).
No shovel tests were conducted in these areas due to the low probability of
intact buried deposits on this sloping eroded surface of greater than 20%. These
areas consistently contained erosional drainages and gulleys. Figure 17 depicts
an area 500 meters south of Dolores Creek in which the project area is located
on a steep scarp leading down to the river, one dissected by shallow erosional
drainages. These scarp surfaces are routinely subject to slopewash from the
higher elevations stripping sediment and moving it to lower elevations. These
areas within the project were classified as low probability and disturbed by
natural forces.

A number of erosional drainages were investigated within the 307 foot traverse
taking line boundary including Arroyo Dolores. These drainages typically
represented small finger ravines and erosional run off environments with little or
no sediment deposition that could contain buried archeological materials.
Because the visible portions of USIBWC property along these drainages were
determined to be highly erosional on slopes of 20-30% and unlikely to contain
intact archeological deposits due to the lack of a significant depositional

Results of Field Investigations

environment, surveyors typically did not shovel test these areas.
Visual
inspection, rather, identified the USIBWC property at these locations as
disturbed and destroyed.
Prehistoric Site 41ZP191 is mapped approximately mid-distance between Area 2
and Arroyo Dolores, at the headwaters of an unnamed arroyo feeding into the
Rio Grande. The site is mapped adjacent to one eastern edge of the 307 foot
traverse taking line. Site 41ZP191 was recommended for further investigations
by the original surveyors. Current investigations determined that the site does
not extend onto USIBWC property (307 foot traverse taking line). The USIBWC
property bounded by the 307 foot traverse taking line at this location was
identified as a zone of highly erosional cutbanks whose context is disturbed and
destroyed. The topographic setting within the 307 foot traverse taking line was
one of a steep sided erosional drainage (slope greater than 20%) and not a
setting for a prehistoric occupation site nor one conducive to the preservation of
intact site deposits. Due to the observed environmental conditions, it is
probable that the site only exists on the relatively flat terrace overlooking the
drainage outside of USIBWC property.
The area of the confluence of Arroyo Dolores and the Rio Grande represented a
significant increase in the topographic elevation, degree of slope and related
erosional factors in the form of gulleys and slopewash (Plate 5). Several shovel
tests were placed up into the drainage area despite the degree of slope and
erosional factors indicated (Figures 18 and 19). Survey investigations were
terminated midway up the drainage because of the increase in slope leading up
to a rock cliff, the upper surface of which was outside the project area (to the
north and south). These areas do not appear to represent depositional contexts
that could contain buried sites. There is little or no Holocene deposition in the
areas surveyed in Arroyo Dolores. Portions of Arroyo Dolores within the 307 foot
traverse taking line extending northeast to US 83 remain unsurveyed. These
areas were not included as part of the current survey due to the erosional
nature and steep sided slopes of the drainage observed within 600 meters of the
river. The current survey was terminated near the location of the easternmost
shovel test within approximately 600 meters of the Rio Grande, as the drainage
continued to climb in elevation, exhibiting very low potential for intact
archeological sites. Thus, the area within the 307 foot traverse taking line near
US 83 was not part of the current survey. However, the upland areas adjacent
to the arroyo, above the 330 foot contour line, may exhibit the potential to
contain surficial archeological sites.

NORTHERN TERMINUS
Moving north, a moderate probability area was identified north of Arroyo
Dolores, in the vicinity of Site 41ZP924 (see below). Access to this area was
achieved by a series of caliche roads traveling west from a Conoco-Phillips gate
along US 83 (Plates 5 and 6). At the location of Site 41ZP924, the road was
drivable up the edge of the upper T2 terrace scarp. From there, crews walked

Results of Field Investigations

over private land down the steep scarp (greater than 30%) to gain access to the
307 traverse line.
The traverse line straddled a level terrace remnant (60
meters in width) with approximately 3-4 meters of recent Holocene deposition
(probably very recent) adjacent to the modern channel of the Rio Grande. The
terrace is described as frequently flooded and heavily eroded by gulleys and
sheetwash from the adjacent T2 terrace. The surface of the terrace was littered
with flood debris and channeled by several gulleys transporting water from the
upper terrace. The terrace was identified as moderate probability due to the
depth of the Holocene sediments, but one significantly altered in the upper
sediments by natural forces. The scarp leading from the T2 terrace was
identified as heavily eroded, not warranting subsurface tests, and outside of the
project area (307 foot traverse line). The remnants of Site 41ZP924 were
identified on the T2 scarp (private property). It is unclear whether the site was
present on the edge of the T2 terrace and is now eroded off into the scarp, or
whether intact portions of the site remain on the T2 terrace (private property).
Extensive shovel testing was conducted in this moderate probability area
especially below and adjacent to the 41ZP924 site area (within the 307 foot line).
It is clear that Site 41ZP924 does not extend over the 307 foot traverse taking
line (Plate 5). The terrace remnant at this location is of sufficient size and
access that mechanical subsurface testing would be warranted.
As previously mentioned, a single archeological site (41ZP924) was observed and
recorded adjacent but outside of the proposed project area. Site 41ZP924 is
situated on private land and USIBWC flood easement located between the 307
and 314-foot traverse taking lines. Site 41ZP924 is a probable Late Prehistoric
site observed approximately 35-40 meters east of the project boundary 307-foot
traverse taking line. The site contained lithic debitage, a small unidentified
single ceramic sherd fragment (black paste with quartz temper), unidentified
thin biface/projectile point, early stage bifaces, burned rock fragments, mussel
shell, groundstone, and bone fragments observed on the ground surface. Site
41ZP924 appears eroded but has the potential to contain intact buried cultural
deposits. Subsurface testing is recommended to determine the vertical and
horizontal extent of the site should there be any Section 106 undertakings
resulting in ground disturbing impacts within the site area.
The northern terminus of the project was accessed by a second caliche road
north of Arroyo Dolores nearly all the way to the rivers edge. From here,
however, access was problematic and the entire length north to the Webb and
Zapata County line had to be walked on foot (Plates 6 and 7). This was some of
the most difficult terrain of the project. The entire northern, very narrow width
adjacent to the Rio Grande (within the 307 line), is identified as very low
probability, serious slopes (20-30%), hummocky topography, numerous
erosional run off and drainage gulleys, and is an area significantly disturbed by
erosion, sheetwash and other natural factors. The northern portion of the
project continued to climb in elevation, essentially representing a different
topography than the southern portion of the project. A few areas contain highly
eroded terrace remnants along the rivers edge (Figure 20). Project areas south
of the northern terminus are nearly exclusively characterized by steep erosional
slopes, hummocky topography, and erosional gulleys (Figures 21-24). Along
these scarps, there is little or no evidence of Holocene deposition, nor a
mechanism for such. These areas may be characterized as upland, erosional
surfaces.

Two Spanish Colonial Ranch sites are recorded on higher topography
overlooking the 307 foot traverse taking line northern project area (41ZP77 and

Dolores and the Rio Grande and is NRHP listed (see previous investigations).
Site 41ZP78 is a larger component related to the original settlement of Dolores
further upstream. Both of these sites are located on a much higher terrace of
the Rio Grande overlooking the current project. These do not overlap the
current project and were not investigated.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted an archeological survey along the
Falcon Lake and Rio Grande shoreline in Zapata County, Texas, on behalf of the
United States Section, International Boundary and Water Commission
(USIBWC), El Paso, Texas (Figure 1). The project was conducted at the request
of the USIBWC to satisfy archeological site inventory and eligibility
determinations under Section 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA). The project was conducted under USIBWC ARPA Permit No. 0014
(Archeological Resources Protection Act) to enable survey on federal property.
The project area extends from the Rio Grande at the Webb and Zapata County
line, near Arroyo Dolores, downstream approximately 13.7 miles to just north of
San Ygnacio, and from the United States jurisdictional boundary in the reservoir
to the 307-foot traverse taking line.
Hicks & Company archeologists surveyed approximately 624.89 acres within the
proposed USIBWC study area. Much of the current project area within the 307
foot traverse taking line boundary consist of narrow linear zones immediately
adjacent to the Rio Grande. The immediate areas adjacent to the shoreline
consisted of sterile, Rio Grande terrace scarp remnants highly disturbed by
erosion and scour complicated by invasive vegetation. These scarp remnants
are frequently flooded and severely erosional in this respect. These areas were
considered to have a low probability for buried cultural resources and were
subject to pedestrian survey and visual inspection. These areas were typically
not shovel tested. Limited shovel tests were conducted in these areas to confirm
ground disturbance and a lack of intact terrace sediments. All areas within the
study area were identified as having either a high, moderate, or low probability
for intact archeological sites. All undisturbed high and moderate probability
areas were systematically shovel tested to explore for buried archeological
deposits. No new archeological sites were documented within the proposed
project area during the current study.
One previously recorded archeological site (41ZP96) overlapping the project area
was documented as disturbed by modern residential and agricultural
development. No further Section 110 or 106 investigations or cultural resource
coordination is recommended for 41ZP96 relative to the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA).
Four previously recorded archeological sites are located adjacent to but not
overlapping the surveyed extent of the USIBWC property boundary (307 foot
traverse). Three of these are Spanish Colonial ranch sites (41ZP74, 41ZP77, 78).
Site 41ZP74 is the NRHP listed Corralitos Ranch. Site 41ZP77 is listed on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). These sites relate to the original
Spanish settlement of the area and founding of the community of Dolores. Both
sites (41ZP77 and 78) sit on the high terrace that overlooks relatively narrow
stretches of the project area (307 foot traverse taking line) in the central and
northern project area and neither intersects the current project. The Corralitos
Ranch settlement (41ZP74) is located approximately 750 feet east of the
USIBWC project area and does not overlap the project.
Prehistoric Site 41ZP191 is located along an unnamed arroyo in the central
project area adjacent to one eastern edge of the 307 foot traverse taking line.
Investigators determined that the site does not extend into the current project
area onto USIBWC property (307 foot traverse taking line). Project areas

Conclusions and Recommendations

adjacent to the mapped location of 41ZP191 were documented as heavily eroded,
disturbed areas.
A single archeological site (41ZP924) was observed and recorded adjacent to the
proposed project area. Site 41ZP924 is a probable Late Prehistoric site and is
situated on private land and USIBWC flood easement located between the 307
and 314-foot traverse taking lines. Site 41ZP924 has the potential to contain
intact buried cultural deposits.
Subsurface testing is recommended to
determine the vertical and horizontal extent of the site and determine the need
for any further investigations relative to determining National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) eligibility status should there be any Section 106 undertakings
resulting in ground disturbing impacts within the site area.
High and moderate probability areas consist of relatively deep Rio Grande flood
terrace deposits, with the potential for deeply buried prehistoric archeological
sites. While shovel testing indicates there are no shallowly buried intact
archeological sites in the project area, these deep Holocene age river terraces
exhibit considerable potential to contain buried prehistoric archeological sites,
based on terrain, setting, context and geomorphology, and on the presence of
similarly documented sites in these settings in the region. It is the opinion of
the Principal Investigators that all high and moderate probability areas as
delineated in this report should be avoided and protected until the deeper
deposits have been assessed with systematic backhoe trenching relative to
Section 110 and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
The two remaining unsurveyed portions of land within the 307 foot traverse
taking line property boundary as delineated in this report should be surveyed for
the presence of archeological sites relative to Section 110 and Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
It is the recommendation of the Principal Investigators that all identified
disturbed and destroyed areas as mapped under the current investigations
warrant no further archeological investigations nor any further archeology
consideration under Section 110 or 106. There are no current USIBWC projects
with proposed ground disturbing impacts below the immediate ground surface
within the project area. All project related documents and materials will be
professionally curated at the Center for Archeological Research (CAR) at the
University of Texas-San Antonio in San Antonio, Texas.
