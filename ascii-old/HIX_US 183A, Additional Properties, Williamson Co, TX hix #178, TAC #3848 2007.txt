Abstract

ABSTRACT
Hicks & Company conducted archeological investigations between July 2005 and
August 2006 for the Additional Properties along the proposed US 183 Alternate. A total
of 25 Additional Properties, totaling 25.49 acres were investigated at the reconnaissance
and survey level. Nineteen properties were determined to have a low probability for
archeological deposits and were not surveyed. The remaining six properties, totaling
14.3 acres, were surveyed, utilizing a total of 14 shovel tests and two backhoe trenches.
No cultural material was observed or collected during the course of the investigations.
All investigations were conducted in accordance with the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966, as amended, 36 CFR 800, the Texas Antiquities Code (13 TAC 26), the
Secretary of the Interiorâs Standards and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic
Preservation (48 FR 44716-44742), the Secretaryâs Standards for Identification (48 FR
44720-44723), the Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the THC, the FHWA, TxDOT,
the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and TAC #3848. All project materials
will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin,
Texas.

Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
US Highway 183 Alternate is a proposed toll road that extends from US 183, south of
the city of Cedar Park, Texas, to the intersection of US 183 and the South Fork of the
San Gabriel River, north of the city of Leander in Williamson County, Texas. The
proposed highway will run parallel to the existing US 183 and bypass the cities of Cedar
Park and Leander, Texas. Under the Programmatic Agreement among the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), the Federal Highways Administration (FHWA), the
Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) and the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT), TxDOT is responsible for Section 106 and Texas Antiquities
Code (TAC) archeological coordination for all Additional Properties along the US 183
Alternate (A) alignment.
As a member of the US 183A Project Environmental
Compliance team, Hicks & Company is the designated consultant for all archeological
cultural resource compliance that may be required during the design-build and
construction phase, including compliance that pertains to Additional Properties.
Additional properties are defined as any and all properties required for the construction,
or to support the construction, or related highway infrastructure, located outside of the
Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) right-of-way boundaries, or resulting
from proposed changes to the right-of-way. These are areas that will be owned or
controlled by the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority (CTRMA) and therefore
subject to Section 106 and Texas Antiquities Code regulatory clearances. Additional
properties may include but are not limited to the locations of detention ponds,
maintenance facilities, and/or minor changes or alterations to the alignment.
TAC Permit 3848 is currently issued to Hicks & Company for the coordination of
Additional Properties along the proposed US 183A in Williamson County, Texas. There
are 25 Additional Properties along US 183A (Plates 1, 2, and 3). Plates 1, 2 and 3
contain restricted site information and have been replaced with a general project
location map. All 25 Additional Properties were subjected to pre-survey investigations
followed by the submittal of an impact evaluation with recommendations for survey or
non-survey. The pre-survey investigations consisted of field visits to evaluate the
integrity of the parcels, revisit previously recorded cultural resources, and determine
the probability for cultural resources to occur. Nineteen Additional Properties were
recommended for no survey based on a low probability for archeological sites to occur.
The remaining six parcels were surveyed resulting in the identification of no new
archeological sites. The survey investigations were summarized in an interim report
that included an overview of the specific project area, a summary of the previous
investigations, an environmental and cultural summary, the results of the field
investigations, and conclusions and recommendations.
A total of 14 shovel tests and two backhoe trenches were excavated within the
Additional Properties on August 7 and 8, 2006. All of the subsurface tests were
negative for cultural material. Based on the results of the background research there
are four previously recorded archeological sites, 41WM646, 41WM714, 41WM736, and
41WM441 that are mapped within the proposed Additional Properties. No evidence of
these sites was observed during the survey investigations. Additional archival research
identified a total of eight potential Historic sites near the proposed US 183A. None of
these potential Historic sites overlap with the current project area. In cases where
potential Historic sites were adjacent to Additional Properties, field reconnaissance
determined the absence of Historic cultural resources within the Additional Properties.

Environmental Setting

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The US 183A Additional Properties project area lies on the western edge of Williamson
County. Odintz (1996) states that the modern temperatures in Williamson County have
an average high from 96Â° F (36Â° C) in July to an average low of 36Â° F (2Â° C) in January.
The county receives an average rainfall of 86 centimeters per year. The vegetation in
western Williamson County is made up of tall and mid grasses, post and live oak,
juniper, and mesquite. Historically, a wide range of wildlife has lived in the county,
including bison, deer, bears, mountain lions, alligators, and small wild game such as
wild turkeys.
The project area lies within the Edwards Plateau physiographic province in central
Texas. According to Wermund (2006), the Edwards Plateau is composed of hard
Cretaceous limestones that are trenched by local streams. The upper drainages
typically consist of dry draws that lead into canyons where springs supply the streams
with a constant water source.
The project area itself consists of three divisions within the Edwards Plateau geology,
based on Barnes et al. (1974). The majority of the project area is in the Fredericksburg
Group (Lower Cretaceous), which is made up of Edwards Limestone, Comanche Peak
Limestone, Keys Valley Marl, Cedar Park Limestone, and Bee Cave Marl. Edwards
Limestone is a hard, brittle layer that is 18-107 meters thick and is made up of
limestone, dolomite, and chert. Comanche Peak Limestone is fine-grained, hard
limestone that often crops out below Edwards Limestone and is up to 24 meters thick.
Keys Valley Marl is soft and white with marine megafossils and a depth of up to 15
meters. Cedar Park Limestone is a fine grained, hard, nodular, and burrowed limestone
that is 12 meters thick. The Bee Cave Marl similar to the Keys Valley Marl but has
different proportions of megafossils. Its depth is 7.5 to 12 meters. Along the South
Fork of the San Gabriel River are Holocene alluvial deposits. The alluvium includes low
terrace deposits made up of clay, silt, sand, and gravel and is the most recent geology in
the area.
The topography of the project area is mostly made up of gentle slopes and flat uplands.
The slope of the topography increases near the shores of creeks. The most prominent
channels in the area are North and South Brushy Creeks and the South Fork of the San
Gabriel River. North Brushy Creek is further subdivided into north and south forks,
both of which cross the US 183A project area. Additional creeks in the project include
Spanish Oak Creek, Cottonwood Creek, Post Oak Creek, and Blockhouse Creek. The
most prominent channels also have the steepest changes in topography. The land just
beyond the north bank of South Brushy Creek is slightly hilly, with hilltops that are 30
meters higher than the ground surface towards the creek. The ground surface
approaching the South Fork of the San Gabriel River slopes downward about 15 meters.
The Soil Conservation Service Survey Map of Williamson County (Werchan and Coker
1983) shows that the project area runs through several soil series, with the most
prominent being the Eckrant series. These soils provide a general description of the
geomorphology of the area and give an overview of the depth and degree of disturbance
of any archeological sites.
The Eckrant series is represented mainly by EeB, Eckrant extremely stony clay, 0 to 3
percent slopes; and EaD, Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes. Eckrant extremely
stony clay occurs on broad ridges and shallow valleys in upland areas. The upper layer
is 28 centimeters thick and consists of stony, very dark clay. The lower layer is made
up of indurated limestone. Eckrant cobbly clay occurs in uplands, with an average

Archeological Investigations â US 183A â June 2007

Environmental Setting

slope of about 4 percent and depth of 33 centimeters. The upper sediment is typically
dark grayish brown cobbly clay with a surface that has 50 percent cover of limestone
cobbles that range from 10 to 20 centimeters in diameter. The underlying material
consists of fractured limestone. Near the southern bank of the South Fork of the San
Gabriel River, Eckrant-Rock outcrop complex (ErG, hilly) follows the channel. It is
made up of about 41 percent Eckrant soils, 38 percent rock outcrop, and 21 percent
other soils.
Additional soil series tend to follow the various creek channels in the project area.
Oakalla soil (Oc), has an upper 18 centimeters of dark brown loam, a middle 22
centimeters of dark brown clay loam, and a lower 128 centimeters of dark brown sandy
loam and occurs in and adjacent to the channels themselves. Sunev silty clay loam
(SuB, 1 to 3 percent slopes) occurs along South Brushy Creek and is a well-drained soil
with an upper layer of grayish brown silty clay that extends 45 centimeters and a lower
layer of calcium carbonate-rich yellowish brown to reddish yellow silty clay loam that
can extend more than 150 centimeters down. Sunev silty clay loam (SuA, 0 to 1
percent slopes) follows the channel of the South Fork of the San Gabriel River and is
similar to the Sunev silty clay loam along South Brushy Creek, but with less slope and
therefore reduced runoff. Fairlie Clay (FaB, 1 to 2 percent slopes) appears along some
of the lesser stream channels in the project area. Its upper layer is dark gray clay that
is about 53 centimeters thick, and its lower layer is gray to dark grayish brown clay and
extends to 117 centimeters. Denton silty clay (DnB, 1 to 3 percent slopes) also follows
some stream channels. It is made up of an upper layer of dark brown silty clay that is
84 centimeters thick, followed by a very pale brown silty clay loam that extends 91
centimeters. Beneath the clay layers is fractured limestone and limy material.
A few other soil series appear sporadically in the uplands of the project area. Doss silty
clay (DoC, 1 to 5 percent slopes) occurs in uplands and has a depth of about 48
centimeters, with the underlying material made up of weakly cemented limy earth and
limestone fragments. Georgetown clay loam (GeB, 0 to 2 percent slopes) is a brown to
reddish brown clay with an approximate depth of 89 centimeters. Crawford clay (CfB, 1
to 3 percent slopes) is also brown to reddish brown and extends to about 69
centimeters. Finally, Brackett gravelly clay loam (BkE, 3 to 16 percent slopes) is about
41 centimeters deep and is made up of pale brown to pale yellow clay loam with 15
percent limestone fragments.
According to the environmental data, archeological sites in the project area are unlikely
to be in a stratified context due to a lack of depth in the sediments. However, multiple
stream channels cut through the area, creating a strong likelihood for the presence of
archeological materials throughout the project area. Most sites would be either surficial
or shallowly buried, but more deeply buried sites could be present along the larger
creeks, such as North and South Brushy Creek and the South Fork of the San Gabriel
River.
Land use within the project area is a mix of agricultural, commercial, and residential.
Several large subdivisions have been constructed adjacent to the proposed US 183A
surrounding the communities of Cedar Park and Leander. Commercial development is
concentrated north of South Brushy Creek and along FM 2243. The areas north of FM
2243 are mostly agricultural properties with plowed fields and livestock agriculture.

Research Design

RESEARCH DESIGN
This section presents the research design and field methodology for the Phase I
archeological investigations of the Additional Properties along the proposed US 183A
right-of-way. The archeological investigations for US 183A Additional Properties were
conducted on August 7 and 8, 2006. The investigation was coordinated through a presurvey impact evaluation and interim report. All investigations were conducted in
accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 36 CFR
800, the Texas Antiquities Code (13 TAC 26), the Secretary of the Interiorâs Standards
and Guidelines for Archaeology and Historic Preservation (48 FR 44716-44742), the
Secretaryâs Standards for Identification (48 FR 44720-44723), the Programmatic
Agreement (PA) among the THC, the FHWA, TxDOT, the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation, and TAC #3848.
Due to the fact that previous surveys of US 183A and surrounding environs have
yielded very few important archeological sites, and due to the nature of the shallow and
disturbed terrain across much of the project area, the methodology included a 100
percent pedestrian survey of only those parcels which exhibited a high probability for
intact, buried archeological sites, or those located adjacent to known sites, or the
archival locations of possible historic-age sites, or areas containing âemergency
discoveriesâ where TxDOT recommends archeological survey. Low probability and/or
extremely narrow/small additions to the right-of-way were coordinated as such in a
pre-survey impact evaluation, and dismissed from the need for 100 percent pedestrian
survey, with TxDOT concurrence. One exception to this was low probability areas that
are larger than five acres, non-lineal and greater than 50 meters in width. There were
no low probability areas that met these criteria. With TxDOT concurrence, high
probability locations were subjected to 100 percent pedestrian field survey. The
components of the investigation included background research, pre-survey impact
evaluations, survey investigations, and site assessment.

BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Background research was conducted for all Additional Properties prior to the pre-survey
fieldwork. Research was conducted at the Texas Historical Commission, the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, and the University of Texas Center for American
History. The primary goal of the background research was to identify previously
recorded archeological sites, potential historic sites, cemeteries, and areas of high
probability. This information was obtained through the examination of site records,
historic maps, aerial photography, regional literature, and reports of previous
investigations.
In a letter dated June 8, 2005, TxDOT made recommendations that define high
probability areas for the US 183A project. TxDOT also recommended that no survey or
THC consultation is necessary for non-high probability areas. TxDOT recommends that
survey shall be required only in the additional project areas of high potential. The THC
has concurred with these recommendations (8 June 2005). Based on the coordination
between TxDOT and the THC, three factors define high probability areas: 1) areas
within 100 meters of known or reported archeological sites; 2) areas within 0.25 miles
of significant streams and waterways; and 3) archival locations of pre-1940 structures
or historic sites. All of the sites documented within the main lanes are previously
cleared for construction. The project maps illustrate the locations of these sites and
were used as the basis for determinations of high probability areas.

PRE-SURVEY IMPACT EVALUATIONS
Following the background research, Hicks & Company conducted pre-survey field visits
to all parcels within the Additional Properties of the proposed US 183A right-of-way.
These field visits consisted of a pedestrian reconnaissance of the property, an
evaluation of the geomorphology, visits to previously recorded sites, investigations of
potential historic properties, and photograph documentation. No subsurface testing or
artifact collection was conducted during the pre-survey visits. The results of the presurvey investigations were summarized in a standardized impact evaluation that
included the summary of investigations, an environmental overview (including soils,
geology, vegetation, and land use), an overview of previously recorded sites, probability
for sites, and conclusions and recommendations. Each impact evaluation included
maps and photographs of the project area.
Impact evaluations provided recommendations for survey and non-survey of the
Additional Properties within the proposed US 183A right-of-way.
Parcels with
Additional Properties recommended for survey were reviewed by TxDOT and
concurrence to proceed with intensive survey was relayed through electronic mail to
Hicks & Company. In general, areas recommended for non-survey were areas that
exhibited a low potential for archeological sites and site preservation. These areas were
typically in uplands with shallow, deflated soil, or areas with previous disturbance.

SURVEY INVESTIGATIONS
All survey investigations were conducted in accordance with the THCâs minimum survey
standards. Hicks & Company utilized pedestrian survey, shovel testing, and machine
excavation to investigate the parcels with Additional Properties recommended for
intensive survey. Shovel tests were excavated in ten-centimeter levels to one meter
below ground surface, culturally sterile soils, or bedrock. Sediment from the shovel
tests were screened through Â¼â mesh hardware cloth. Observed data and soil profiles
were recorded on standardized shovel test forms. Shovel tests were excavated in areas
recommended for survey and within previously recorded sites. In site areas, a
minimum of six shovel tests were excavated to determine the presence or absence of the
site.
In areas where Holocene deposits were expected to extend below one meter below
ground surface, Hicks & Company utilized machine excavated trenches to explore the
deeper sediments. These areas were located primarily along major streams and
tributaries with alluvial soils. Trenches were typically 1.5 meters wide (along the
center) and five meters long and excavated to culturally sterile soils. A sample of
approximately 20 percent of the total excavated sediment was screened through Â¼â
mesh hardware cloth. Soils within the trenches were profiled and recorded on
standardized backhoe trench forms and photographed. All trench excavations were
excavated in accordance with OSHA regulations and supervised by a âCompetent
Personâ as defined in OSHA 1926.650(b).
No cultural material was observed or collected during the course of the investigations.
Upon approval of the final report, all relevant project materials including, but not
limited to, field notes, photographs, survey forms, and the final report will be curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas.

Cultural History and Previous Archeological Investigations

CULTURAL HISTORY AND PREVIOUS
ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Archeologists generally divide the chronology of central Texas into four periods that
span 12,000 years of human habitation in the area. Based on the assessment by
Ricklis and Collins (1994), the Paleoindian period lasts from 9200 to 6000 B.C. and is
characterized by a subsistence pattern that relied primarily on hunting. Paleoindian
sites are the least common, but isolated Paleoindian artifacts are found throughout
central Texas.
Early Paleoindian technologies include Clovis, Folsom, and the
controversial Plainview projectile point types. Later Paleoindian technologies include
the Wilson, Golodrina-Barber, and St. Maryâs Hall projectile point intervals. These point
types are sometimes associated with small burned rock features, which appear to be
precursors to the larger rock features of the Archaic period (Collins 2004).
The Archaic period spans 6000 B.C. to A.D. 600 and is noted from an increased
diversity in both tools and subsistence (Ricklis and Collins 1994). The Archaic period in
central Texas is most generally known for the use of heated rocks in processing food.
Archeologists typically divide the Archaic into Early, Middle, and Late parts. The Early
Archaic is represented by Angostura, Early Split-Stem, and Marindale-Uvalde point
intervals. Additional tools such as groundstone, hammerstones, grooved stones, and
Guadalupe and Clear Fork bifaces (probable woodworking tools) indicate increasing
complexity during this period. Large burned rock features and earth ovens for cooking
bulbs are also present in the Early Archaic. The Middle Archaic is represented by the
Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan-Travis projectile point intervals. The BellÂ­
Andice-Calf Creek interval most likely coincides with a migration of bison into the
region, and the sites from this period tend to be more ephemeral due to the necessity of
mobility for bison hunting. The Taylor and Nolan-Travis intervals mark a return to the
more sedentary, hot rock cooking lifestyle. Burned rock middens (large accumulations
of broken and discarded heated rocks) make their first appearances during this interval.
The Late Archaic represents the height of popularity for burned rock middens,
particularly near the beginning of the period, when moisture is lowest and other
subsistence options are less viable. Numerous projectile point types emerge during the
Late Archaic, along with additional artifacts such as corner tang knives, stone pipes,
and marine shell ornamentation (Collins 2004). Some archeologists further subdivide
this period into Late Archaic I and II (Johnson 1995). The first interval represents dry
conditions with increased midden accumulation, and the second interval follows
increased moisture with cultural changes such as smaller projectile points and possible
religious influences from Eastern Woodland cultures.
The Late Prehistoric period, extending from A.D. 600 to A.D. 1600, marks the
appearance of the bow and arrow in central Texas, along with the later appearance of
pottery. The Late Prehistoric period in central Texas is generally divided into two
intervals that follow the distinction between the Austin and Toyah cultural intervals.
The Austin interval is marked by the appearance of small, thin (Scallorn) projectile
points that probably indicate a switch from atlatl to bow and arrow technology. Warlike
violence increases, but subsistence technology remains essentially the same as that of
the Late Archaic. The Toyah interval represents a more drastic change, in which
pottery, Perdiz points, large thin bifaces, prismatic blades, and scrapers become
prominent. Much of this technological shift indicates a greater reliance on hunting,
particularly bison (Collins 2004).

Cultural History and Previous Archeological Investigations

Finally, the Historic period lasts from A.D. 1600 though A.D. 1950 and follows the
arrival and spread of European-based cultures into the region. Collins (2004) divides
the Historic period into three parts. The earliest part begins with the arrival of the first
Europeans in the late seventeenth century. Indigenous populations at this point have
already been heavily displaced by disease as well as Spanish oppression in the south
and mounted Apaches in the northwest. Spanish missions characterize the next part of
the Historic period. Missions were not common in central Texas, except for the ones
established in Bexar County. By the end of the middle Historic, Comanches have
migrated into the central Texas region. During final part of the Historic period,
European-derived settlement gradually replaced all the indigenous habitation of the
region.
In Williamson County, archeological sites from all time periods are present. The most
representative example is the Wilson-Leonard Site, which is located near the project
area (along Brushy Creek) and spans the Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric periods.
According to Collins (1998), archeologists recorded the site in 1973, and the first test
excavations took place in July 1981. Large-scale excavation lasted over two years, from
January 1981 through April 1984.
However, any report on the site remained
unpublished for nearly 10 years, so archeologists re-visited the site in 1992 and 1993 to
apply more modern archeological techniques for a more complete analysis. The
excavations revealed Paleoindian features such as an 11,000 year old bison bone bed
and a 10,000 year old human burial. Archaic features included rock-lined ovens from
Early Archaic contexts and burned rock middens from the Middle and Late Archaic.
The Late Prehistoric period is represented mostly by Scallorn arrow points and may
have contributed to the accumulation of one of the burned rock middens. The extensive
archeological remains at the Wilson-Leonard Site enable archeologists to examine
changes in subsistence strategies and technology over a long period of time in a single
area.
According to Odintz (1996), Spanish explorers likely passed through the county as early
as the late seventeenth century, and some missions were established along the San
Gabriel River in the following century. Anglo settlement of the county began in earnest
when Dr. Thomas Kenney established Kenneyâs Fort on Brushy Creek in 1838. The
Texas Legislature organized Williamson County in 1848, naming Georgetown as the
county seat. The new countyâs population and level of intensive cultivation (primarily
subsistence crops) increased up to the Civil War, after which much of the vigorous
agricultural activity dropped significantly. Although the war inflicted little damage on
the county, the total value of farms and livestock dropped dramatically.
The development of railroads in Williamson County greatly influenced settlement. The
first railroad to cross through Williamson County was the International & Great
Northern Railroad which came through in 1875. The later Missouri Pacific Railroad,
now Union Pacific, is paralleled by US 79. The arrival of railroads and the development
of the breaking plow enabled cattle and cotton to become boom industries in the 1870s.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Although much of the project area has not been previously surveyed, earlier projects
have uncovered archeological sites in and near the project area. There are four
previously recorded sites within the proposed Additional Properties with one additional
site located nearby.
In 1980, Prewitt and Associates, Inc. conducted an
identification/survey of the Ideal Basic Tract and recorded Site 41WM441 within the US
183A project area. In November 1984, Espey-Houston and Associates conducted an
intensive survey and shovel tested Blockhouse Creek and recorded Site 41WM646.

Espey-Huston and Associates recorded Site 41WM714 in February 1986 after an
intensive survey with shovel tests. J. Genthe, a TAS Steward, recorded Site 41WM736
in January 1987 after speaking to locals and conducting a surface survey. Finally, the
nearby Site 41WM698 was recorded by Coastal Environment, Inc. in July 1984 after an
intensive survey with shovel tests.

Site 41WM441 is located on an upland bench near the floodplain of South Brushy
Creek, just south of South Brushy Creek Road. The site is poorly recorded in the THC
records and of an unknown size. The archeologists collected a single projectile point of
an unspecified type and mentioned a historical component. They also stated that the
site has been disturbed by terracing and therefore any near-surface archeological
materials would be out of context. No further work was recommended.
Site 41WM646 is located on the northwestern side of a gently sloping hill about 610
meters south of New Hope Road and 1460 meters east of US 183. The size of the site is
180 by 140 meters. The survey collected two cores, two bifaces, debitage, and one
modified flake. The archeologists state that the nature and depth of the site needs to be
determined. Further work was recommended.
Site 41WM714 is located on the northern bank of South Brushy Creek 650 meters
south of Harry Mann Road and 900 meters east of US 183. The size of the site is 150
by 75 meters. It consists of one biface, a core, debitage, and some pieces of burned
limestone, all on the surface with no evidence of buried materials. The surface has
most likely been disturbed due to erosion and clearing.
No further work was
recommended.
Site 41WM736 is located on a rise about 230 meters south of FM 1431 and about one
kilometer east of US 183. The size of the site is about 0.1 square kilometers. The site
has never been excavated, but the landowner has collected from the surface for 17
years. The survey recorded a broken dart point (unknown type), a core, and five other
possible artifacts. According to THC records, the site was to be developed in 1987. No
further work was recommended.
Site 41WM698 is located on the west edge of a seasonal drainage 350 meters north of
North Brushy Creek. Its size is about eight meters in diameter, and it consists of a
chert core surrounded by core shatter. Shovel tests revealed no further depth to the
cultural materials. No further work was recommended.
The previous sites recorded in the project area reveal that there is a high potential for
further archeological materials to be uncovered. The collection from Site 41WM76
indicates the possibility of finding old (Early Archaic) sites in this area. However, most

of the sites have no depth and are disturbed by natural or human forces. Site
41WM646 may have some depth, but its vertical extent remains unknown. Although
the probability of finding sites is high, most of the project area appears deflated.

Results of Investigations

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
In July 2005 and August 2006, Hicks & Company conducted pre-survey and survey
investigations of 25 Additional Properties, totaling 25.49 acres, within the proposed US
183A right-of-way. Based on the Texas Antiquities Permit for the investigation of the
Additional Properties, only the properties within high probability areas were to be
investigated. Additional Properties were determined to have a high probability for intact
archeological sites based on the following criteria: 1) areas within 100 meters of known
or reported archeological sites; 2) areas within 0.25 miles of significant streams and
waterways; and 3) archival locations of pre-1940 structures or historic sites. In
addition, Additional Properties located outside of high probability areas that did not
total more than five contiguous acres were considered to have a low potential for
archeological deposits. Additional Properties that did not meet these criteria were
determined to have a low potential for intact archeological sites. These criteria were
established by TxDOT in a coordination letter dated June 8, 2005 in which the THC
concurred with TxDOT recommendations that defined high probability areas and
eliminated low probability areas from any further THC consultation.
As a result, a total of 25 Additional Properties were evaluated at a reconnaissance level
in the field to make recommendations for survey or non-survey (Table 2). Of these
properties, 11 were listed as high probability and 14 were listed as low probability. Of
these 11 Additional Properties, six were recommended for additional survey. Table 2
summarizes the size and recommendations for each of the Additional Properties.
Additional Properties 10 through 15, 20 and 21, 25 through 28, and 30 and 31, totaling
5.4 acres, were all determined to have a low probability based on the above criteria and
were not recommended for further work. Additional Properties 3, 4, 8, 9, and 22,
totaling 5.79 acres, were all determined to be high probability areas based on the above
criteria, but following pre-survey field investigations were recommended for no further
work. As a result of the pre-survey field investigations Additional Properties 1, 2, 5, 7,
23, and 24, totaling 14.3 acres, were recommended for additional survey. The results of
the pre-survey investigations were summarized in an impact evaluation and submitted
to TxDOT. The Texas Department of Transportation concurred with the survey
recommendations in an electronic mail dated January 25, 2006.
Hicks & Company conducted intensive archeological investigations within Additional
Properties 1, 2, 5, 7, 23, and 24 on August 7 and 8, 2006. The survey included a
pedestrian survey of each property, shovel testing, and backhoe trenching. A total of 14
shovel tests and two backhoe trenches were excavated. All subsurface tests were
negative for cultural material and no archeological deposits were identified within the
Additional Properties. The results of the survey investigations were submitted in an
interim report to TxDOT and then coordinated with the THC. TxDOT and the THC
concurred with Hicks & Companyâs recommendations for no further work on August
24, 2006 (see Appendix A). The investigations are summarized by property below.

Comments
This area overlaps with site 41WM714. Located on
the north side of South Brushy Creek along the east
side of the proposed US 183A ROW this area is intact
within an alluvial terrace. Examination of an adjacent
cutbank indicates a potential for intact deposits to a
depth of 2 meters.
This area is located along an existing drainage
easement that is part of an extensive commercial
complex along the east side of the proposed US 183A
ROW. Impacts from this commercial complex have
destroyed the northern portion of the project area.
However, there is a potential for intact subsurface
deposits in the southern portion of the project area.
This area is located along an existing drainage
easement along the west side of the proposed US
183A ROW. Impacts from this drainage easement
have destroyed this portion of the project area.
The entirety of this detention pond sits on a deflated
upland ridge overlooking Spanish Oak Creek. The
Additional Property is disturbed from severe erosion
and the recent construction of homes adjacent to the
property. Large cobbles, sparse weeds and modern
trash dominate the landscape. The potential for intact
deposits is low.
Additional Property is in close proximity to Spanish
Oak Creek and previously recorded sites.
This area is a narrow ditch along the east side of the
proposed US 183A ROW and has been severely
impacted by erosion as a result of the construction of
ROW fence and a silt fence barrier. The potential for
intact deposits is low.
This area is heavily eroded along Cottonwood Creek
which in this area is a shallow ephemeral drainage
with no defined channel. Numerous large cobbles are
present on the surface. The potential for intact
deposits in this area is low.

PROPERTY 1
Property 1 is located on a high upland terrace north of and overlooking South Brushy
Creek approximately 10 meters above the channel. This Additional Property is 5.7
acres in size on the east edge of the US183A right-of-way at an elevation of 259 meters
to 262 meters AMSL. Soils within the property are mapped as Eckrant cobbly clay
(EaD) and Sunev silty clay loam (SuB). The Eckrant soils comprise over 75 percent of
the property and consist of stony soils with limestone and dolomite cobbles ranging
from 10 centimeters to 20 centimeters in size. The Sunev soils occur in a narrow strip
across the middle of the property and may be the result of fill along a fault line in the
bedrock. Bedrock was observed near the ground surface along the creek bank exposure
(Figure 1). Two backhoe trenches were excavated within the portions of the property
with deeper soils (Sunev soils). Sediments observed in the trenches are calcareous and
appear to be upland soils. Trenches were terminated at a very pale brown, highly
calcareous, sub soil at a depth of 80 centimeters (Trench 2) and 145 centimeters
(Trench 1) below surface (Figures 2 and 3). Eight shovel tests were excavated within
the property to depths between 15 centimeters and 68 centimeters below surface, and
ground surface visibility across the property was 25 percent to 45 percent (Figures 4
and 5). Site 41WM714 overlaps the southeast corner of the property and consists of a
prehistoric surficial lithic scatter on the north bank of South Brushy Creek. Espey,
Huston and Associates recorded this site in 1986 as part of a water utility line survey.
A manhole and monitoring line were observed on the property during the current
investigations. No evidence of 41WM714 was observed on the surface or in any of the
subsurface investigations. Due to the lack of cultural material within Property 1, no
further work was recommended for this Additional Property.

PROPERTY 2
Property 2 is located on a high upland terrace along the east edge of the US183A rightof-way. This linear property is approximately 20 meters wide and extends for about 510
meters (1.67 acres) north of Property 1 at an elevation of 265 meters AMSL. A
transmission line has been installed near the center of this property and runs the entire
length of the property (Figure 6). A lumberyard and asphalt road currently occupies
the northern half of this property (Figure 7). Within the southern half of the property,
an area approximately two to five meters in width appear to be intact. These areas are
located within dense cobbly soils that did not allow for subsurface testing. Ground
surface visibility on the property was between 30 percent and 40 percent. No cultural
material was observed within Property 2. Site 41WM441 overlaps the northern end of
the property, however no evidence of this site was observed during the survey. Due to

PROPERTY 5
Property 5 is located along the south side of FM 1431 and west of the US183A right-ofÂ­
way. This property is 0.35 acres in size at an elevation of 280 meters AMSL. This
property is a small drainage easement within an intermittent tributary of Spanish Oak
Creek. At the time of the survey this property was mostly inundated with water and did
not allow for subsurface testing (Figure 8).
There are no previously recorded
archeological sites located in or around this property. It is the opinion of the Principal

Investigator that Property 5 will have no effect upon Historic Properties and no further
work was recommended.

PROPERTY 7
Property 7 is located on the east side of the US183A right-of-way on a high upland
terrace approximately 450 meters southwest of Cottonwood Creek. The property is
linear and is approximately 20 meters wide and extends for about 390 meters (0.76
acres) at an elevation of about 285 meters AMSL (Figure 9). Site 41WM646 overlaps
the Additional Property and was recorded in 1984 by Espey, Huston and Associates as
a low-density lithic scatter. During the initial survey of the site no subsurface testing
was conducted and Espey, Huston and Associates recommended the site for further
work to determine the nature and depth of the site. Hicks & Company excavated a total
of six shovel tests within the Additional Property to depth of between 20 centimeters
and 30 centimeters below surface. All six shovel tests were negative for cultural
material and terminated due to the density of cobbles in the soil. Ground surface
visibility on the site was between 20 percent and 50 percent with soils consisting of
stony clays. The investigators did not observe any evidence of site 41WM646 within the
Additional Properties. Due to the lack of cultural material, no further work was
recommended for Property 7.

PROPERTY 23
Property 23 extends east from the US 183A right-of-way and is located along the north
side of FM 2243, which parallels Brushy Creek to the south. This linear property is
approximately 182 meters in length and 20 meters wide (0.18 acres) at an elevation of
280 meters AMSL. The majority of this property overlaps an existing drainage ditch
along FM 2243. In addition, there is commercial development along the northern edge
in the western half of the property. The eastern half of the property contains a deeply
excavated drainage ditch and culvert (Figures 10 and 11). Soils on the property are
upland, vertic soils prone to argilliturbation and not conducive to site preservation.
Based on the high degree of disturbance within the Additional Property and the lack of
observed cultural material, no further work was recommended for Property 23.

PROPERTY 24
Property 24 is a linear drainage easement that extends south from the US 183A rightof-way to the North Fork of Brushy Creek. This property is approximately 850 meters
long and 36 meters wide (5.65 acres) at an elevation of 286 meters to 296 meters AMSL.
The majority of the property is located on a broad, deflated upland terrace within a
plowed field (Figure 12). Vegetation consists of sparsely scattered sunflower, ragweed,
and thistle with a ground surface visibility of 80 percent to 100 percent. The soils are
primarily vertic with deep cracks visible on the surface. Near the North Fork of Brushy
Creek, at the southern terminus of the property, the terrain is hummocky due to
erosion and cattle traffic. The creek in this area is a poorly defined ephemeral stream
with no cut bank and no apparent deposition. A pedestrian survey consisting of four
transects was conducted over the property. Due to the high surface visibility, and the
low potential for buried deposits, no subsurface tests were excavated.

No cultural material was observed during the pedestrian survey. Site 41WM698,
recorded by Espey, Huston and Associates in 1985, is approximately 60 meters west of
the project area. This site consists of a small (8 meter diameter) surficial scatter of
chert debris and shatter. The investigators visited the recorded location of the site and
could find no evidence of cultural material. Overall the property appears to be severely
eroded from continual plowing and overgrazing. The potential for intact buried deposits
within the property is very low. Due to the lack of cultural material and the deflated
nature of the landform, no further work was recommended for Property 24.

Conclusions

CONCLUSIONS
Hicks & Company conducted a pedestrian survey and excavated 14 shovel tests and two
backhoe trenches within Additional Properties 1, 2, 5, 7, 23, and 24 resulting in the
identification of no cultural material. In addition, no evidence of sites 41WM441,
41WM646, 41WM714, and 41WM698 was found within the Additional Properties. As
mapped, the portions of these sites, 41WM441, 41WM646, 41WM714, and 41WM698,
which overlap with the Additional Property, appear to be extensively disturbed by urban
development, construction, and agriculture. Therefore, it is the opinion of the Principal
Investigator that the portions of the sites overlapping on the Additional Properties do not
contribute to any NRHP eligibility of these sites and construction will have no effect
upon Historic Properties. Based on the results of the survey field investigations, Hicks
