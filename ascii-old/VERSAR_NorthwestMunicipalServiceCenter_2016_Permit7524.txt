EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Between February 16 and March 2, 2016 archaeologists with Versar Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian
survey that adhered to the standards outlined under Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Archaeological
Survey Standards for Texas and Rules of Practice and Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas. This
survey covered 29.10 acres of property owned by the City of El Paso in the northwest section of the
municipality. The project area encompassed the footprint of a proposed municipal service center located
north of Doniphan Drive; the Keystone Heritage Park borders the western margin of the survey parcel.
Archaeological sites 41EP493 and 41EP494, both State Archaeological Landmarks (SALs), extend across
the heritage park and into the current project area. The project area is bounded to the south-southwest by
Kappa Road and to the southeast by Atlantic Road. The Keystone Dam and dam apron form the northern
boundary of the survey parcel. The extreme southern boundary is a business parking lot accessing Doniphan
Drive.
The project goal was to identify all prehistoric and historic archaeological sites in the survey parcel and
develop National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility recommendations for any newly discovered
sites. In addition, the contextual integrity of those portions of 41EP493 and 41EP494 that extend into the
survey area were to be assessed towards contextual integrity. In effect, the current NRHP eligibility
recommendation was to be re-evaluated.
The pedestrian survey identified 29 isolated occurrences; however, none retained contextual integrity. No
newly identified sites were encountered. In an effort to investigate the state of contextual integrity present
at the two State Archaeological Landmarks, a testing strategy was implemented. This strategy targeted 4.30acres and 1.13-acres of existing sites 41EP493 and 41EP494, respectively and included shovel test
excavations, backhoe trenching, broad-area scraping, and test unit excavation.
Within the 4.30-acres of 41EP493, a one-half acre core area that contained intact buried cultural deposits
was exposed. Within this core area were six prehistoric features-all were documented. Two features were
further exposed during the subsurface testing phase. Feature 4 yielded a Late Archaic age dating to the
Hueco phase (calibrated age range of B.C. 385 to 200). Feature 5 produced a Middle Archaic age dating
to the Keystone phase (B.C. 2465 and 2210). As such, 41EP493 remains elegible for listing into the NRHP;
a preservation plan for the core area of this SAL is presented in Chapter 6. In contrast, 41EP494 showed a
near absence of intact deposits, which suggests a loss of contextual integrity within the 1.13-acres
potentially impacted by the proposed construction efforts.
Due to the poor condition present at 41EP494, only monitoring of subsurface activities is recommended.
In addition, the 1.13-acres of 41EP494 within the survey parcel are recommended as ineligible for NRHP
listing due to a severe loss of contextual integrity. In each case, those portions of the SALs that are outside
of the surveyed 29.10 acre project area remain elegible for NRHP listing and maintain their present SAL
status.

INTRODUCTION
Between February 16 and March 2, 2016 archaeologists with Versar Inc. conducted a pedestrian survey of
29.10 acres with limited testing in west El Paso, El Paso County, Texas (Figure 1-1). The area of potential
effect was on property owned by the City of El Paso. The proposed impact to these municipality-maintained
lands generated the requirement for a Texas Antiquities Permit and cultural resource inventory. As such,
the project goal was to determine whether the undertaking would impact any significant archaeological
resources, including State Archaeological Landmarks 41EP493 and 41EP494.
The area of potential effect (APE) encompasses the development footprint for a proposed municipal service
center located north of Doniphan Drive. The Keystone Heritage Park borders the west and west-northwest
sections of the survey parcel. The Keystone Heritage complex subsumes the majority of 41EP493 and a
smaller portion 41EP494, each protected by the Archaeological Conservancy (Figure 1-2). The northern
section of 41EP494 lies within privately-owned land that is beyond the designated APE of this undertaking.
Both SALs; however, extend in part, across the heritage park and into the current project impact area.
To this end, the proposed construction activities will impact 29.10-acres of land bounded to the southwest
by Kappa Road and to the southeast by Atlantic Road. The Keystone Dam and dam apron form the northern
boundary of the survey parcel. The southern boundary is a graded parking lot accessing Doniphan Drive.
Impacts to the parcel are currently noted, resulting from past development and public access. The most
prominent impact to the survey area is ground leveling, which occurred during the dam construction and
more recently during improvements to Doniphan Drive. Modern construction and residential waste were
noted throughout the parcel area. The property is fenced along the Keystone Heritage Park boundary and
along the southwest parcel margin.
The evaluation process was carried out in two phases consisting of an intensive inventory of the 29.10 acres,
followed by subsurface testing and a geomorphologic assessment of the landform and soils within the parcel
footprint. The survey employed a pedestrian transect method for documenting artifact concentrations and
features which may potentially identify potential sites. This method used global positioning system (GPS)based location data to maintain the survey transects, along with integrated ArcPad Software and tabulated
attribute pull-down menus to accurately record both location and attribute data of identified artifacts. The
integration of the pedestrian survey and digital recording techniques provided a complete and consistent
documentation of visible cultural resources within the survey parcel. The inventory included those portions
of 41EP493 and 41EP494 that are contained in the survey parcel.
The second phase of the project entailed subsurface testing. Subsurface investigations included the
excavation of shovel test pits (STP) and one 2-m by 2-m test unit. The STPs were excavated to expose
stratigraphy sequence and provide insight into both geomorphic and cultural context. These excavations
included 42 shovel test excavations across 41EP493 and 41EP494. An additional eight shovel test pits were
placed in areas outside of the SALs to further explore the possibility of buried cultural deposits. In all, 50
shovel test pits were completed during this project.
A single formal excavation unit (2-m by 2-m) targeted Feature 4 and followed basic data-recovery methods
(Condon et al. 2010; Miller 2007). The test unit was placed over Feature 4, a burned-rock concentration;
excavation units were successful in recovering chronometric data in support of intrasite spatial patterning
of cultural materials, and recognition of possible site activities.

In addition, 12 backhoe trenches were excavated across the survey parcel. Of the 12 trenches, six focused
on 41EP493 and 41EP494 and assessed depositional context and explored for cultural deposits. Feature 5,
a pithouse, was exposed during the trenching process. Six wide-area scrapes consisting of 5-m by 5-m wide
squares were carried out both within and outside of the two site areas; no additional features were identified
during this final mechanical task.
As such, this document presents the methods and results of the investigations conducted during the 29.10acre survey. As presented, Chapter 1 provides a general summary of the undertaking. Chapter 2 presents a
brief overview of the environmental setting of the study area. Chapter 3 contains the culture history of the
local region and summarizes previous work conducted on the site and the methods utilized during this
project. Chapter 4 presents the results of the survey and Chapter 5 includes a summary of these
investigations. Chapter 6 introduces the concluding statements and recommendations for future work.

CHAPTER 2.
ENVIRONMENTAL AND GEOMORPHIC SETTING
A detailed environmental overview of the project area has been presented in several previous publications.
For a more comprehensive overview of the regional geology and environmental setting the reader is referred
to Barnes (1983), Gile et al. (1981), Carmichael (1985), Monger et al (1993), Miller, Graves, and Landreth
(2009), O’Laughlin (1980), and Vierra (2009). In brief, the project area is located in west El Paso, Texas,
along the alluvial slope margins of the Franklin Mountains and Rio Grande terraces. More broadly, the
survey parcel falls within the eastern edge of the Basin and Range Physiographic Province of the western
United States, an area where the continental crust, through compression and expansion, formed a series of
north/south-trending mountain ranges and intermountain, graben-defined basins. Major physiographic
landforms associated with this geological phenomenon include fault-block mountain chains, internally
draining basins, and the Rio Grande Valley. Landforms within the intermountain basins, or bolsons, include
alluvial fan piedmonts, inter-fan valleys, and rock pediments along the flanks of mountains, and interior
basin floors of fine-grained alluvial and eolian sediments with small playa depressions and extensive
alluvial flats.
The Franklin Mountains, one of the more prominent geological features in the project area, rise abruptly
from the valley floor east of the project area to an average height of 3,000 ft. above sea level. Precambrian,
Paleozoic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary age deposits are present within the mountain range and consists of
sandstone, quartzite, and rhyolite with granite an andesite intrusions (Gerald 1986). Soils within the project
area vary in depth, but are generally shallow. The soil series present within the APE contain a complex
series of buried gravelly colluvium that blankets remnant Ab and B-horizons. Additional gravelly clay
loams interspersed with colluvium and sand lenses underlie the remnant soil horizons identified above.
More specific to the project area is the southwest-sloping alluvial fan margin and the Keystone Dam barrier.
Cobble and gravels emanating from these features facilitate sheetwashing of the landscape immediately
west of the dam. The Keystone Dam and Dam apron form the northern boundary to the survey parcel. It is
suspected that construction of the dam impacted 41EP494 directly, and overtime indirectly, in the form of
precipitation runoff and erosion. Impacts to the parcel are currently noted, resulting from past development
and public access (Figure 2-1). The most prominent impact to the survey area is ground leveling, which
occurred during the dam construction and more recently during improvements to Doniphan Drive. Modern
construction and domestic debris is intermittently spread throughout the parcel area. The property is fenced
along the Keystone Heritage Park boundary and along the southwest parcel margin.
The floral community identified within the project area is typical of far west Texas, southern New Mexico,
and northern Mexico, and is characteristic of the Chihuahuan Desert ecologic zone. To the west, along the
upper alluvial slopes and terraces of the Franklin Mountains, are Lecheguilla (Agave lecheguilla), Torrey
yucca (Yucca torreyi), soaptree yucca (Yucca elata), prickly pear cactus (Opuntia spp.), ocotillo
(Fouquieria), and creosotebush (Larrea tridentata). These upper elevation vegetation communities quickly
give way to open desert scrub in the lower elevations. Mesquite (Prosopis sp.), creosotebush (Larrea
tridentate), four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), soaptree yucca (Yucca elata), and bunchgrass are
common in these lower habitats.

In addition to the wide diversity of flora found within the region, an abundance of animal life is also present.
Primary animal resources available in the region include mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), pronghorn
antelope (Antilocapra americana), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus audubonii), and jackrabbits (Lepus
californicus). For a more detailed inventory, several authors provide in-depth discussions on the regional
resource availability (Anderson 1993; Hard 1983; O'Laughlin 1978). As presented in Figure 2-2 through
Figure 2-5, the vegetation communities and assigned landforms within the proposed APE are disturbed
from road development and flood control activities. Within the project area, preservation is more
pronounced within the central portion of the survey parcel where vegetation has anchored sediments and
preserved good contextual integrity.
Soils between the mountains and Rio Grande, including those that fall within the current study area, consist
of generally deep colluvial-related deposits. Using the stratigraphic sequencing established by O’Laughlin’s
(1980) and Carmichael (1985), the anticipated soil deposits within the project are expected to vary in depth
with shallow, gravelly loamy sand deposits associated with fluctuating alluvial aggregation. Generalized
soil profiles document five soil units, or zones at 41EP493 and three zones at 41EP494. Zone 1 sediments
are recent alluvial deposits and eolian sands.
Cultural deposits at 41EP493 are generally expected to occur in O’Laughlin’s Zone 2, or potentially in
Zone 4 (1980: 43). Although Zone 2 was documented to 80 cm thick, it is expected that this zone will only
be 30 cm in thickness due to erosion and continually deflation. Zone 2 is described as an organic light
brown loamy sand matrix (O’Laughlin 1980: 44). Zone 3 soils are sandy loams approximately 60 cm thick;
however, it is expected that this stratum will be much thinner in the project area. Zone 4 is a relatively
shallow sandy loam deposits, ranging between 5 and 15 cm in thickness (O’Laughlin 1980: 46). As such,
it is expected that archaeological deposits will be associated within O’Laughlin’s (1980) Zone 2 and 4;
however, the stratigraphic continuity between the two sites within the survey area are questionable given
three decades of alluvial activity and modern impacts the parcel.

CHAPTER 3.
CULTURAL CONTEXT
The prehistory of the Jornada Mogollon region encompasses several cultural historical periods and phases
(Table 3-1). The following discussion of the cultural history of the region is adapted and modified from a
more comprehensive overview by Miller and Kenmotsu (2004) and has, in large part, been presented in
detail in Lowry et al. (2004) and Miller et al. (2009).

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (10,000 TO 6000 B.C.)
The earliest conclusively documented evidence of prehistoric human occupation in the Jornada region
occurs during the Paleoindian period. Paleoindian adaptations have been viewed as a tradition of small,
highly mobile bands with a subsistence economy centered on hunting large game animals such as mammoth
and bison (Judge 1973).
The period is subdivided into three sequential traditions marked by functional and stylistic differences in
tool kits that are thought to reflect changing hunting and settlement adaptations: the Clovis and Folsom
complexes of the early Paleoindian period and the Plano/Cody complex of the late Paleo-Indian period.
Clovis Complex
Knowledge of Clovis occupation in the Jornada Mogollon region has been obtained almost entirely through
rare isolated finds of the distinctive, fluted lanceolate projectile point characteristic of the period. However,
few Clovis points and even fewer Clovis sites have been documented (Meltzer and Bever 1995). Two
habitation sites of this period have been reported from the Jornada Mogollon region. Beckett (1983) notes
the presence of Clovis tools mixed with later Paleo-Indian materials at a site in Rhodes Canyon, in New
Mexico’s southern Tularosa Basin. Weber and Agogino (1997) reported a substantial Clovis occupation at
Mockingbird Gap in the northern Tularosa Basin. Otherwise, very few artifacts or occupations attributable
to this period have been recorded during the course of numerous professional archeological surveys on Fort
Bliss and many other areas of the region; it appears that Clovis manifestations are exceptionally rare within
the Jornada Mogollon region. The nature of Clovis settlement types, hunting and subsistence adaptations,
mobility patterns, or technological organization in the Jornada remain almost entirely unknown.
Folsom Complex
Folsom manifestations in the Jornada region are much better known than their Clovis predecessors.
Numerous Folsom points and occupation sites have been recorded during archeological surveys. Although
they have been found in many topographic zones, including mountains, alluvial fans, and plateaus, most
Folsom materials have been documented near playa basins, major and minor drainages, and the margins of
the Rio Grande Valley, which may indicate an adaptation of hunting game animals near water sources.
Several excavations of Folsom components have been undertaken during the past decade, including at a
site in Fillmore Pass on Fort Bliss, Boles Wells in the Tularosa Basin (Mauldin and O’Leary 1994), and
Padre Canyon sites 41HZ504 and 41HZ505 in the Hueco Bolson southeast of El Paso (Mauldin and Amick
1998; Mauldin and Leach 1997). The nature of Folsom tool forms, subsistence adaptations, and mobility
patterns in the region has also been the subject of serious investigation (Amick 1994a, 1995, 1996).
Late Paleoindian to Plano and Cody Complexes
A variety of tool traditions have been recognized for the late Paleo-Indian period and are collectively
referred to as the Plano and Cody complexes (Wheat 1972). Meserve, Golondrina, Angostura, Eden, and
Scottsbluff projectile points characterize the period. Isolated Plano/Cody projectile points and tools are
common in the Hueco Bolson and Tularosa Basin (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). Plano/Cody components
are found in many topographic zones, including mountains, alluvial fans, and plateaus, but most finds have
been documented near playa basins, major and minor drainages, and the margins of the Rio Grande Valley,
which also may indicate an adaptation of hunting game animals near water sources.

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6000 B.C. TO A.D. 200/400)
The Archaic period represents the longest span of human occupation within the Jornada region. This period
is better represented archeologically than the Paleo-Indian period, with an impressive array of evidence
from rockshelters and open sites found in all environmental zones. The 6000-year interval of the Archaic
period has been conventionally divided into Early (6000–4000/3000 B.C.), Middle (4000/3000–1200 B.C.),
and Late (1200 B.C.–A.D. 200/400) subperiods that have been defined on the basis on projectile point styles
and stratigraphic data from rockshelters.
Early Archaic (6000 to 4000/3000 B.C.)
The Early Archaic is one of the least understood time periods of the entire Jornada prehistoric sequence.
Early Archaic occupations have been defined primarily on the basis of projectile point styles and a few
insubstantial deposits or features. The overall number of projectile points does not greatly outnumber those
of the preceding Paleo-Indian period.
Few firmly dated Early Archaic contexts have been identified in the Jornada, and have primarily involved
deeply buried features or rock shelter deposits. However, these deposits have yielded little data concerning
subsistence, settlement, and technology (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
Middle Archaic (4000/3000 to 1200 B.C.)
Fundamental subsistence, settlement, and technological adaptations established in the Early Archaic tend
to be maintained through the Middle Archaic, although, they may have become intensified throughout the
latter part of this 2,000-year-long interval. This inferred intensification of subsistence and settlement
adaptations is based on an overall increase in the number of sites and an increase in feature use based on a
significant increase in the number of radiocarbon dates available for this period.
Middle Archaic sites also tend to be found along drainages, are generally larger, and contain more features
than Early Archaic sites. House structures are noted for the first time in the Middle Archaic. House
structures were found at Keystone Dam (O’Laughlin 1980), which has an occupation spanning the period
between 2500 and 1800 B.C. The presence of thermal features and groundstone artifacts at Middle Archaic
sites suggests a focus on plant foods in addition to hunting.
Late Archaic (1200 B.C. to A.D. 200/400)
In terms of settlement, subsistence, and technological adaptations, the Late Archaic - particularly the latter
half of the period - represents a true break in the long Archaic sequence of the previous 4,000 years. The
Late Archaic period is characterized by a dramatic increase in sites, features, and material culture
attributable to this period. Small circular structures are also common during this period. Projectile points
change to corner- and side-notched forms in the latter half of this subperiod. They also become significantly
smaller (marking the introduction of the bow and arrow).
Among the most important developments during the Late Archaic in the Jornada region is the first
conclusive evidence for the use of cultigens. Upham and MacNeish (1993) date the inception of cultigens
at 2500 B.C. based on corn pollen found at Keystone Dam (O’Laughlin 1980). Many view the use of
cultigens as part of an increasing diversification of plant foods exploited during Late Archaic times, one
that also provided additional stability, buffering, and/or predictability to the subsistence base (Matson 1991;
Minnis 1992; Wills 1988). Whether or not this process may have been a cause, or effect of increasing
population levels, and in turn, reduced territories available for population movements, is not well
understood.

FORMATIVE PERIOD (A.D. 200/400 TO 1450)
The Formative period encompasses several important transitions in settlement adaptations. These include
a relatively rapid succession of changes in architectural form, settlement structure, subsistence, and
technology, including a trend of decreasing mobility coupled with increasing agricultural dependence and
specialization that culminated in puebloan occupations between A.D. 1300 and 1450.
The Formative period sequence has recently been revised (Miller 2005) and now includes four subperiods:
the Mesilla phase (A.D. 200/400 to 1000), the early Doña Ana phase (A.D. 1000 to 1150), the late Doña Ana
phase (A.D. 1150 to 1300), and the El Paso phase (A.D. 1300 to 1450).
Mesilla Phase (A.D. 200/400 to 1000)
The Mesilla phase is characterized by the appearance of the El Paso brownware ceramic tradition with
Alma Plain as a rare intrusive ware. Other intrusive ceramics (predominantly Mimbres white wares and
other Mogollon wares) appeared in the region after A.D. 600, but were not common. Painted pottery (El
Paso Bichrome) also made its first appearance late in this phase. Pithouses were constructed during this
period (Lehmer 1948), but were generally similar to the huts of the Archaic period (Hard 1983). Structures
become increasingly formal after A.D. 600. Sites generally are larger and more numerous, and contain more
artifacts than sites from the earlier Archaic period.
Early and Late Doña Ana Phases (A.D. 1000 to 1150 and A.D. 1150 to 1300)
The Doña Ana phase was originally defined by Lehmer (1948) and was further characterized by Carmichael
(1986). Doña Ana phase sites, as defined by Lehmer (1948), are characterized by the presence of El Paso
Bichrome and El Paso Polychrome pottery associated with adobe surface construction. Debate continues
about the ability to distinguish Doña Ana phase occupations within the archeological record (see
Carmichael 1985, 1986; Hard et al. 1994; Mauldin 1993; Mauldin et al. 1998; Miller 1989, 1990).
Overall, the changes that occurred during the Doña Ana phase include the introduction of polychrome
pottery, rapid population increase, artifact changes that included larger manos and metates, decreased
projectile point sizes with larger forms still in use, and changes in intrusive ceramic types from Mimbres to
Chupadero and Chihuahuan wares. The increasingly formal pit structures eventually led to later pueblo
architecture of the El Paso phase.
El Paso Phase (A.D. 1300 to 1450)
The final and most intensive prehistoric use of the region occurred during the El Paso phase (also referred
to as the Pueblo period). This phase is characterized by an increase in the number of large and small
residential sites, increased artifact densities, and a clustered settlement pattern (Carmichael 1986; Whalen
1977, 1978), as well as the introduction of small triangular projectile point forms. Larger projectile point
styles are regularly found on the floors of rooms, indicating the possible continuing use of the atlatl in
conjunction with the bow and arrow.
The El Paso phase is characterized by peak population levels, diverse artifact assemblages, use of pit
structures, individual surface rooms, aboveground pueblos, and dependence on agriculture, but not to the
exclusion of hunting and foraging. Residential permanency at sites during wet years and seasonal
movement during periods of dryness or lean years is postulated. Alternatively, a seasonal sedentary lifestyle
alternating between the desert floor, alluvial fan, and riverine habitation may have been the norm.

PRECONTACT PERIOD (A.D. 1450–1581)
While the Jornada Mogollon ceased to exist as a cultural entity sometime around A.D. 1450, it is unlikely
that the region was totally depopulated (Miller 2001). Several researchers have suggested that a major shift
in subsistence strategy has resulted in the general lack of recognizable evidence in the archaeological record
after A.D. 1400 to 1450 (Beckett and Corbett 1992; Wimberly and Rogers 1977). To refine temporal
definition of archaeological remains post-dating A.D. 1450 and pre-dating Historic contact, the term
Precontact period is utilized in this text.
The Precontact period is herein defined as the relatively brief (approximately 130 year) span between what
appears to be abandonment of the El Paso phase Pueblo settlement system and the first documented
encounter between Native Americans and Spanish explorers. Several cultural groups may have used the
study areas during the Precontact period. According to Beckett and Corbett (1992), Chinarra, Concho,
Jano, Jocome, Manso, Suma, Piro, and Tarahumara may have occupied the region. Unfortunately,
archaeological evidence representing these groups has not been found or recognized.
PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1581–1659)
This period is not well defined for the Jornada Mogollon region, although research suggests that sites of
this period can be identified (Miller 2001; Seymour 2002). Though poorly defined in the literature, the
Protohistoric period represents the temporal span between first European/Native American contact and the
Historic or settlement period. Many of the aboriginal groups inhabiting the region during the Precontact
period may also have been present during the Protohistoric period. Contact between Native Americans and
Europeans, however, undoubtedly wrought changes to aboriginal lifestyles.
Not only did the introduction of new materials such as metals revolutionize subsistence activities, but also
a defensive posture was initiated among some Native American groups. This posture often resulted in a
changed campsite preference that, along with changes in material culture, is potentially visible in the
archaeological record. Without the discovery of metal arrow points or worked glass, Protohistoric
components are very difficult to identify. Radiocarbon dating of Protohistoric period sites is often
unreliable and inconclusive. While it is well known that the Sacramento and San Andres mountain, and for
that matter, all of the Tularosa Basin region, were once part of the Mescalero Apache homeland,
recognizable evidence remains elusive.
The Mescalero Apache represent the only documented aboriginal Protohistoric inhabitants of the Tularosa
Basin region. While Apache occupation of the basin persists into the Historic period, their control of the
local area thwarted settlement until around 1860. Hence, within the confines of the Tularosa Basin, the
Protohistoric period may technically extend into the mid-1800s. Since the regional Protohistoric-Historic
period division complicates discussion of Apache use of the basin, portions of the following review may
overlap that of the Historic period.
First documented by Spanish explorers, and confirmed archaeologically (Sale and Laumbach 1989), the
Apache once roamed freely throughout the area. Sometime around A.D. 1500, these nomads infiltrated and
took control of the Tularosa Basin. Their tactics in warfare successfully discouraged Spanish colonization.
Judging from reports of military campaigns against the Apaches, Indian trails were once an easily
recognized feature on the Tularosa Basin landscape. Locations frequented in the San Andres Mountains,
including San Nicolas Spring, Salinas Peak, and Hembrillo Canyon, would presumably be linked to Sierra
Blanca, Fresnal Canyon, and Dog Canyon to the east, by well-worn Apache footpaths. Regionally, the
Protohistoric period terminates in 1659 with permanent establishment of Spanish missions in the El Paso
area by Fray Garcia (Peterson and Brown 1994).
HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1659-PRESENT)
The date used for the onset of the Historic period is based on developments within the El Paso and Rio
Grande valley areas. By 1659 the first missions were established in El Paso. By 1848, after the signing of

Versar Proj. No. G30742.0002.01, Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest
Municipal Center, El Paso County, Texas, Permit No. 7524

the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the region was under the jurisdiction of the United States government.
The first U.S. military excursions in the region was in 1849. After it was stabilized by the military, ranching
related activity began in large portions of the area.
The Ranching Era
Ranching in the area was introduced by a number of interests, mainly from Texas. Ranching-related sites
compose the bulk of evidence for historic activity in and around the project area. The Homestead Act of
1862 provided affordable land to ranching families, and by the 1890s numerous, relatively small ranches
had been established throughout the area. The introduction of cattle came in 1866 by way of the
Goodnight-Loving Cattle Trail, which entered New Mexico via the Pecos River. Two trails led from the
Pecos River; one trail used the route from El Paso, and the other went across the Sacramento Mountains.

CHAPTER 4.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND FIELD METHODS
BACKGROUND HISTORY
Previous investigations are primarily associated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers El Paso Flood
Control Project that entailed the development of three flood-retention dams (i.e., Keystone, Thorn Drive,
and Mulberry Drive) and a series of highway diversion channels along the west side of the Franklin
Mountains (Gerald 1976). Initiating in 1976, surveys covering the lands within and adjacent to the proposed
inventory parcel identified 18 prehistoric sites, including the two sites, 41EP493 and 41EP494, that fall
within the current project area (Gerald 1976; O’Laughlin 1980; Carmichael 1985; Vierra 2009).
In response to the anticipated adverse effects to the sites identified by Gerald (1976), eight sites were tested
by the El Paso Centennial Museum of the University of Texas at El Paso. The testing targeted sites 41EP491
(EPCM 29), 41EP492 (EPCM 31), 41EP325 (EPCM 32), 41EP493 (EPCM 33) 41EP494 (EPCM 34),
41EP495 (EPCM 35), 41EP496 (EPCM 36), and 41EP492 (EPCM 37) (O’Laughlin 1980:1; Carmichael
1985:19). The testing process revealed significant prehistoric occupations at five of the sites, the most
significant being 41EP493 and 41EP494.
Site 41EP493 yielded evidence of an extensive middle Archaic component that contained as few as 23 and
as many as 41 intact pithouse structures (O’Laughlin 1980). In addition, Foster (1988) documented and
excavated a single Mesilla phase pithouse at 41EP493 (EPCM 33 South) in the late 1980s. At least one
pithouse was identified at 41EP494 (O’Laughlin 1980).
As noted in Figure 4-1, both 41EP493 and 41EP494, contained a north and south portion. The northern
section of 41EP493 primarily falls within the protected Keystone Heritage Park (i.e., EPCM 33 North). The
southern portion of 41EP493, as defined by O’Laughlin (1980) as EPCM 33 South, falls south of the
heritage park boundary. The north half of 41EP494 (EPCM 34 North) is north of the proposed APE for the
municipal service center and is contained on privately owned property. A small section of 41EP494 extends
into the Keystone Heritage Park.
The southern portion of 41EP494 is within the current development footprint. Giving the significance of
these two sites, the flood control dam and diversion channels were redesigned to avoid impacting the most
significant portions of 41EP493 and 41EP494, leading to the introduction and development of the 52 acre
Keystone Heritage Park (Vierra 2009). Moreover, sites 41EP493 and 41EP494 were nominated as State
Archaeological Landmarks on 7 November 1983. The red line designation denotes the SAL boundary for
each site.
Additional work targeting the non-protected sites included inventories of 41EP325 and 41EP495 by
Carmichael (1985) and survey, documentation, and testing of the five previously identified sites in and
adjacent to the current project area by O’Laughlin (1985). Equally important were Carmichael’s (1985)
excavations at 41EP492 and 41EP496; both sites were targeted as part of the ongoing El Paso Flood Control
Project. A more recent undertaking included a cultural resource survey of a natural gas line immediately
northeast of the current undertaking (Hesse 2015).
Finally, the project area falls within the Elephant Butte Irrigation District (EBID) (Hesse 2015). This NRHP
district contains 217 water diversion and irrigation systems that bridge both New Mexico and Texas. While

Versar Proj. No. G30742.0002.01, Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest
Municipal Center, El Paso County, Texas, Permit No. 7524

the current project area has no contributing elements to EBID, it is worth noting the spatial relationship to
the APE and service center footprint.

FIELD SURVEY AND SITE DOCUMENTATION PROCEDURES
The survey parcel, including archaeological sites 41EP493 and 41EP494, retained highly variable data
potential defined by the amount of alluvial deposition, potential site burial, and expected site disturbance.
In response, a multistage strategy to ensure maximum return on work effort and level of funding was
undertaken. This staged strategy approach involved an initial phase of fieldwork designed to identify and
differentiate surface deposits, followed by more intensive, targeted approach that seeks to verify and
identify deposits beneath the ground surface. After each stage was completed, a period of consultation with
the THC Point of Contact (POC) to discuss and direct the direction of effort was conducted. Based on
comments issued on March 9, 2015 and January 20, 2016 by the THC and in accordance with the intensive
survey parameters set forth by the CTA and approved by the Texas THC, the following field procedures
were implemented during the survey.
Prefield Research
The staff at Versar, El Paso, Texas carried out a comprehensive review of the online Texas Atlas database;
obtained existing Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory site files, and researched pertinent literature
to identify any previously recorded prehistoric and historic sites within the survey parcel. Literature relied
heavily on Gerald (1976), O’Laughlin (1980), and Carmichael (1985). In addition, aerial photographs,
USGS 7.5- minute quadrangle, geologic maps, and soil survey maps were examined prior to the field
investigation. These additional research avenues augmented the background research and provided relevant
information on topography, soils, vegetation, geology, the local environment, and levels of development
within the vicinity of the project area. An initial search revealed ten current archaeological sites within a
one-half mile of the proposed survey parcel; the most relevant being 41EP493 and 41EP494. The remaining
eight sites included 41EP491, 41EP492, 41EP495, 41EP496, 41EP2461, 41EP2462, and 41EP5544.
Pedestrian Transect Survey
Versar carried out the pedestrian survey using a 10-m (~32 ft.) transect interval that started in the
southwestern portion of the parcel; survey crews worked in a north-to-south direction. Transect width was
contiguous leaving no unsurveyed areas remaining between transects. The amount of area covered,
including recording time did not exceed a rate of 15 acres per person, per eight hour day calculated for the
entirety of the project; ground visibility approximated 85 percent. In order to effectively accomplish the
survey, Versar provided two experienced personnel to carry out this task: one Project Archaeologist and
one field technician. Each crew member was equipped with a Trimble GEO-XT handheld GPS unit with
integrated ArcPad data dictionaries to document cultural materials.
Site Definition, Documentation, and Mapping
All investigations adhered to guidelines provided in Section 106 of the NHPA, the CTA Guidelines for
Performance, Curation, and Report Development, and THC Archaeological Survey Standards for Texas.
The two archaeological sites were assessed in relation to four evaluation criteria defined by 36 CFR Part
60 (please see below). Although sites 41EP493 and 41EP494 have been recommended as eligible for
NRHP listing and are identified as SALs, it is critical to evaluate the supporting significance statements on
a current level of scale. Significance statements were developed for only those portions of 41EP493 and
41EP494 that fall within the development footprint. The remaining portions of the two sites that are outside
the footprint maintained their NRHP eligible status. NRHP recommendations for each site were based on
three fundamental criteria used to assess a site’s ability to address research questions and/or contribute to
the current scale of regional prehistory: 1) assemblage content and density, 2) chronological potential, and
3) site context and integrity.

Using the horizontal distribution of cultural materials as a defining factor, Versar recorded only those
portions of 41EP493 and 41EP494 that fell within the project APE. Boundary information was converted
to ESRI™, ArcGIS-shapefile format. Site location maps were created on Digital Orthophotographic
Quarter Quadrangle (DOQQ) aerial photos and USGS 7.5-minute (1:24,000) topographic quadrangle maps.
Site boundaries, features, and artifacts were recorded using a Trimble© GEO-XT handheld GPS unit that
provided sub-3 meter accuracy in the field. In-field analysis of artifacts was conducted by Versar’s field
crew. Versar archaeologists carried out a good-faith effort to approximate 100 percent of the visible
assemblage and followed standardized sets of attributes presently used by Versar for survey (e.g., type,
size, material, modification, decoration). Data recorded during this time included overall environmental
and geomorphic context, spatial patterning of artifacts and features, integrity and chronological potential,
and any unique aspects of the site and its constituent features and artifact assemblage. All features, shovel
test pits, artifact collections, diagnostic or unique artifacts, and the locations of major artifact concentrations
were recorded. Finally, a permanent datum (i.e., rebar) and identification tag was placed near the
approximate center of the site and recorded with the high-resolution Trimble GeoXT™ handheld GPS unit.
The identification tag included a state trinomial site number, recording date, and notice that Versar was the
contracting firm that recorded the site. The site datum was added to the site map, as will other observations,
such as modern disturbances and prominent natural features.
Geomorphic and Geoarchaeological Investigations
Geomorphic and geoarchaeological investigations were carried out during the testing phase of the
evaluation and focused on two primary objectives. The first was to characterize the geomorphology of
41EP493 and 41EP494 with particular emphasis on identifying and mapping the depth and extent of
Holocene depositional units. Once this was accomplished, the integrity of the cultural deposits was
evaluated and the amount of burial, exposure, and erosion (or disturbance) of areas within each site was
investigated. These procedures helped isolate the most productive areas of a site for further investigation
and hand excavation. Trench profiles established the relationship of the stratigraphic sequence to any
cultural deposits identified during the survey and/or mechanical investigations.
Mechanical excavations were judgmentally placed in areas outside of 41EP493 and 41EP494 to provide a
comparative soil profile and to further explore the alluvial deposition of the project area. Mechanical
stripping was assigned to specific areas of the site to remove the overburden of recent eolian sands and
alluvium and expose the underlying Zone 2 interface as identified by O’Laughlin (1980). To adequately
fulfill the data needs of this project, 12 backhoe trenches were excavated across the survey parcel to include
41EP493 and 41EP494 and assess depositional context and to explore for cultural deposits. Six trenches,
three at each SAL, were excavated; the remaining six trenches were placed within the APE, but outside of
the 41EP493 and 41EP494 boundaries. An additional six wide-area scrapes consisting of 5-m by 5-m wide
squares were also applied to the survey parcel. Two scrape areas (one for each SAL) supported the trenching
regiment at 41EP493 and 41EP494.
The Soil Scientist and Project Archaeologist collectively selected the locations for the 142 linear meters of
backhoe trenching and 150 square meters of wide-area mechanical stripping (six locations at 5-m by 5-m).
The exposure of buried features during the mechanical excavation resulted in the temporary suspension of
backhoe trenching to allow for a full documentation of exposed cultural deposits.
Manual Excavations
The manual excavation strategy consisted two approaches: 1) shovel test pit excavation and 2) formal 2-m
by 2-m unit excavation. The shovel test pit excavations included 50 test pits placed across the project area.
Shovel test pits were placed along north-south oriented transect lines; the transect lines were spaced 30-m
apart (100 ft.). Shovel test pits (30-cm by 30-cm) were positioned 15-m (50 ft.) apart along each transect
line. In each case, the shovel test pit reached a depth ranging from 20 cm to 1-m below the ground surface.

Municipal Center, El Paso County, Texas, Permit No. 7524

Sediments removed during the excavation process were screened through 1/8-inch hardware mesh; all
shovel tests were profiled. A total of 42 shovel test pits were excavated across 41EP493 and 41EP494
(n=30 at 41EP493 and n=13 at 41EP494). An additional seven shovel test pits were placed outside of the
SALs to further explore the possibility of buried cultural deposits.
Formal excavation units (2-m by 2-m) targeted features and followed basic data-recovery methods (Condon
et al. 2010; Miller 2007). Excavation units concentrated on recovering chronometric data in support of
intrasite spatial patterning of cultural materials, and recognition of possible site activities. Attention was
given to identifying the Middle Archaic deposits documented by O’Laughlin (1980). During the manual
excavation stage, horizontal control was established in 2-m by 2-m grid units. Level 1 was excavated as a
natural level, identified by O’Laughlin (1980) as historic eolian sand deposits. Subsequent soil horizons
were excavated in arbitrary 10-cm levels within a natural deposit, each was excavated 20-cm (i.e., two
excavation levels) below ground surface to confirm the presence of sterile deposits. Sediments removed
during the excavation were screened through 1/8-inch hardware mesh; at least one test unit wall was
photographed and drawn in cross section. All features associated with the 2-m by 2-m unit excavation were
photographed and drawn in plan view. Each bisected feature had the exposed half photographed and drawn
in cross section. Samples, including carbon-stained sediment and wood charcoal, were collected from the
features. When sufficient, organic material was submitted for radiocarbon dating.

NATIONAL REGISTER ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PREHISTORIC AND HISTORIC SITES
The NRHP eligibility recommendations thresholds for this project referenced the specific series of data
criteria set forth in the 36 CFR 60.4 and the CTA guidelines. The qualification of a property identified as
eligible for listing in the NRHP is judged in relation to four evaluation. These criteria are applied following
the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions. The quality of significance
in American history, architecture, archaeological, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings,
structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling,
and association, and:
A. That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
D. That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR
§ 60.4, emphasis added] (Federal Register 1981).
A key component of the NRHP eligibility program implemented by Versar sought to clearly define the
associations between features, activity areas, and artifacts. Archaeological sites with integrity that
contained artifacts and features that can contribute information toward addressing a research issue were
regarded as significant and recommended for listing on the NRHP under Criterion D of 36 CFR 60.4. In
support of the NRHP recommendation, Versar developed explicit and unambiguous statements describing
the integrity and research potential of features and activity areas. The spatial arrangements and the
interaction of features and artifacts in relation to geomorphic landforms and topography were addressed.
Sites found to be lacking in chronometric potential or geomorphic integrity, or for which data potential is
so limited than the site has no relevance to any of the research issues, will not meet the significance
threshold of Criterion D of 36 CFR 60.4 and were considered ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. If it is

determined that a proposed undertaking will have an adverse effect on the identified historic properties,
Versar will recommend that a program of avoidance, protection, or data recovery be implemented to
mitigate the undertaking.
NRHP ELIGIBILITY EVALUATION AND REVISED HISTORIC CONTEXT FOR ARCHAIC PERIOD SITES
Recent analyses of 3,800 radiocarbon dates, combined with a review of the past two decades of
archaeological work on Middle and Late Archaic period occupations across the greater Jornada region,
including the Keystone Dam archaeological complex, has prompted a potential revision of our present
understanding of the settlement, subsistence, and social trends of this 5,000 year-long time interval (Miller
2015; Miller and Graves 2015). A revised phase sequence has been developed that tentatively includes two
Middle Archaic Period phases (Tularosa and Keystone) and three Late Archaic phases (Fresnal, Arenal,
and Hueco) with revised beginning and end dates. Of interest is the identification of a previously unknown
500-year hiatus between circa 2750 and 2300 B.P. in the occupation of certain landforms and use of certain
features and technologies. This period, designated the Arenal Phase, appears to represent a reversion to
highly mobile settlement in the middle of the Late Archaic sequence.
Given the general nature of the Late Archaic historic contexts for the region, a move towards developing a
more refined group of historic contexts to better guide NRHP eligibility evaluations, mitigation programs,
and other preservation and management decisions for the region is currently being discussed (Miller et al.
2009). The first of the proposed historic contexts addresses the Late Archaic Hueco Phase (2300–1500 B.P.,
or 300 B.C.–500 A.D.). The second historic context to be revised is the Arenal Phase (2750–2300 BP, or
750–300 B.C.). Radiocarbon samples recovered from the testing stage would potentially augment the
chronometric database for the region and provide additional information towards furthering this culturalhistorical revision.
The Arenal Phase is a distinctive interval in the Late Archaic sequence during which several major features
and settlement types, including burned rock middens, storage pits, and rockshelter occupations, disappear
from the radiocarbon record for nearly 500 years. Very few maize dates exist for this period compared to
the preceding and subsequent Late Archaic phases. Hearth and pithouses show slight declines in
radiocarbon dates during this interval. This indicates that the period does not represent a hiatus or
abandonment, but rather an interval during which settlement and subsistence adaptations appear to have
reverted to a highly mobile, non-agricultural system (Miller 2015).
The Hueco Phase follows the Arenal Phase and is the final or terminal phase of the Archaic Period sequence.
There is a marked increase in dated contexts of this period, including a drastic rise in house structures, pits,
and dates on corn. The first intensively occupied village settlements appear during this period, and spatial
arrangements of houses, common areas, and storage pits are a common feature of such settlements.
Evidence of maize agriculture is present in most upland settlements in the Sacramento Mountains, but for
the first time during the Late Archaic sequence agricultural villages also appear in the desert lowlands. The
first widespread evidence for ritual also appears during the Hueco Phase, including rock art and ritual use
of caves. While the level of effort assigned to the survey and testing, is not designed to fully address the
research issues associated with a changing historic context, the proposed inventory and testing plan will
potentially add to our existing knowledge of 41EP493 and 41EP494 and by proxy contribute to a more
accurate understanding of the Archaic occupation of the region.

CHAPTER 5.
RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
This project entailed an intensive pedestrian survey of 29.10 acres in El Paso County, Texas. The APE was
defined by the layout for a proposed municipal service center located north of Doniphan Drive; the
Keystone Heritage Park borders the east and northwest sections of the survey parcel. Prehistoric sites
41EP493 and 41EP494, both State Archaeological Landmarks that primarily fall within the protected
Keystone Heritage Park, in part, extend into the current project area. The landscape within the APE was
generally disturbed, primarily from the development of the Keystone Dam, which along with the heritage
park formed the western and northern boundary of the project area. Kappa Road provided access along the
southwest margin of APE. Atlantic Road provided entry along the southeastern boundary of the parcel. The
southern boundary is a graded parking lot accessing Doniphan Drive.
The data collected during this investigation resulted in the further documentation of sites 41EP493 and
41EP494, both recommended for inclusion for NRHP listing under Criterion D of 36 CFR 60.4. Based on
the 1980 findings, these sites retained geomorphic integrity and chronological data potential, as well as the
necessary assemblage association to contribute to a broader understanding of the regions prehistoric past.
The evaluation process was carried out in two phases consisting of an intensive inventory of the acreage,
followed by subsurface testing and geomorphological assessment of sites 41EP493, 41EP494, and areas
within the parcel footprint. The survey employed a pedestrian transect method for documenting artifact
concentrations and features. This method used global positioning system (GPS)-based locational data,
along with integrated ArcPad Software and tabulated attribute pull-down menus to accurately record both
locational and attribute data of artifacts identified on the landscape. The integration of the pedestrian survey
and digital recording techniques provided a complete and consistent documentation of visible cultural
resources within the survey parcel. The inventory process for this project facilitated a program of
systematic survey involving a 10-m (~32 ft.) transect interval that started in the southwestern portion of the
parcel; survey crews worked in a north-to-south direction covering all portions of the 29.10 acres. Overall,
the current project resulted in the excavation of 50 STPs, 12 backhoe trenches, six 5-m by 5-m scrapes, and
one 2-m by-m hand unit. Equally important, the evaluation process re-evaluated the portions of 41EP493
and 41EP494 within the APE in regard to their existing NRHP recommendations. The findings are
presented in the following sections.
ISOLATED OCCURRENCES
Isolated Occurrences were defined as locations containing a single artifact, or low-density of artifacts, or
single feature without artifacts. In the majority of the findings, isolated occurrences were surface finds with
little or no contextual integrity. As such, isolated occurrences do not meet the minimum thresholds to
qualify as archaeological sites. The inventory process identified 29 isolated occurrences outside of 41EP493
and 41EP494 (Figure 5-1 and Table 5-1).
The 29 recorded isolated occurrences included a total of 36 items. A total of 23 prehistoric artifacts, two
prehistoric features, and two historic pottery sherds. In addition, eight collector piles were documented and
one modern refuse deposit. Each collector’s pile consisted of a variety of artifacts concentrated in a
localized area (Figure 5.2). Artifacts were confined to the surface and included a mixture of ceramics,

Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest Municipal Service Center, El Paso County, Texas

groundstone, and flaked-stone tools and debitage. While the origin of the piles is uncertain, it is suspected
that these collections accumulated during the Keystone Dam construction era. However, whether the
artifacts were collected during the construction phase or brought from outside the area and deposited in the
vicinity of the heritage park is unclear. More critical, is recognizing that the piles lack contextual integrity
and provenience and do not lend themselves to the eligibility or significance of the project area. Each of
the collector’s pile was trowel tested confirming that the concentrations were restricted to the ground
surface. In addition, STP No. 6 was excavated into Isolated Occurrence 23, a collector’s pile that was
outside the current 41EP494 boundary, but within O’Laughlin’s (1980) EPCM 34 South designation.
Moreover, Backhoe Trench 12 and Mechanical Scrape 1 targeted Isolated Occurrence 16, a collector’s pile
on the margin of EPCM 33 South. The excavations reaffirmed that the artifacts assigned to the collector’s
piles were contained to the ground surface and lacked contextual integrity.

Figure 5-1. Map showing location of isolated occurrences within the project area.
Two features were identified as isolated occurrences. Isolated occurrence 2 was a 1.5-m in diameter
charcoal stain identified in the graded portion of the survey parcel closest to Doniphan Street. The stain
contained one rhyolite cobble fragment; depth was less than 10-cm below ground surface. The carbon stain
had been impacted by ground leveling activities and generally lacked good preservation. The second feature
consisted of a 4-m by 4-m scatter of fire-cracked rock adjacent to 41EP494. The scatter included 15 burned
rhyolite cobbles with little evidence of buried context. Finally, one modern trash concentration consisting
of building debris was noted. Isolated Occurrence 17 was identified along the southern parcel boundary and
contained asphalt, cement, modern brick, and corrugated tin. All of the isolated occurrences were fully
documented and do not meet site criteria. As a result, none of the isolated occurrences are considered
eligible for inclusion into the NRHP. As a result, further documentation of, or additional research at these
locations is not warranted.

SHOVEL TEST PIT EXCAVATIONS
The subsurface testing plan initiated with a program of systematic shovel test excavations within sites
41EP493 and 41EP494 followed by more targeted shovel test pits within the broader footprint of the
proposed service center (Figure 5-11). Shovel test pits within the sites were placed along trasects at 25-m
intervals; transects were spaced 30-m apart and oriented in a north-south direction. Shovel test pits were
approximately 30-cm in diameter with no one excavation reaching more than one meter below ground
surface. Excavations followed natural soil stratigraphy until culturally sterile subsoils were encountered.
Each soil was assigned a sequential numerical sequence according to the order in which it was enountered.
All excavated soils were screened through 1/8-inch hardware mesh. Recovered artifacts were bagged
separately according to the stata that produced them. Data on each shovel test along with a photograph were
recorded on standardized forms developed by Versar.
Versar excavated shovel tests in a directed manner across those portions of 41EP493 and 41EP494 that fell
within the current project area. Excavations were carried out on terrain that exhibited built up sediment or
showed evidence of possible buried context. An additional seven shovel test pits were excavated outside
the two sites in areas that again contained accumulated sediments and/or visible artifact distribution.

Figure 5-11. Map showing the shovel test pit locations across the project area.
In general, the southwestern portion of the survey subsumed 41EP493 and contained a mixed stratigraphic
sequence characterized by colluvial slopewash and intact soils. Shovel Test Pit 4, for instance, revealed a
fairly deep, consistent deposit of gravel-filled, sandy slopewash to a depth of 0.50 m below ground surface.
This depositional sequence is repeated along the western boundary of 41EP493. Shovel Test 18 provides
5-9

Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest Municipal Service Center, El Paso County, Texas

an alternative example of intact deposits identified in an area of the site that retains intact buried cultural
deposits. In this shovel test, a moderately thick (0.40 m thick) stratum of colluvial sediments, gravels,
modern bottle glass, and prehistoric artifacts overlies a possible anthrosol containing intact fire-cracked
rock and wood charcoal. This stratum may correlate to the occupational zone associated with Feature 5.
The north-central portion of the survey included a section of site 41EP494. This portion of the survey parcel
exhibited increased evidence of incising and severe depositional slopewash. Surface survey confirmed that
soils in this portion of 41EP494 were eroded with broad open areas characterized by diminished vegetation
and two-track roads. Shovel testing verified this observation. Excavation of STPs 1-6, 8, 10-13 consistently
showed a general lack of soil development with shovel tests terminating at approximately 0.50-m below
ground surface with only one extremely gravelly, sand deposit identified. Shovel Test Pits 7 and 9 differed
only in the degree of distinct alluvial events present in the excavation profile. Shovel Test Pit 7 revealed an
upper unit of recently deposited gravelly sand that reached a depth of 5-cm below ground surface.
Underlying this suface accumulation was a 0.30-m thick-reddish brown (7.5YR6/3) sand loam horizon that
contained a high density of gravels. The basal unit was exposed between 0.30 and 0.50-m below ground
surface as a light brown (7.5YR6/3) gravel-filled sand matrix. No artifacts were recovered from any of the
STPs excavated within 41RP493.
In addition, seven STPs were judgementally placed outside the site boundaries, but within the project area
(Figure 5-12). Shovel Test Pits 1-5 were excavated in the east half of the parcel. In a similar environment
to 41EP493, the landscape was heavily eroded with areas of deflation, and numerous vehicle impacts.
Shovel tests in these locations displayed soil profiles that had been disturbed by slopewash. Shovel tests 15 provide evidence of disturbed context. These shovel tests revealed two primary soil units, each reflective
of slopewash deposition. Subsoils included an upper reddish brown (5YR5/3) gravelly sandy clay deposit
that extended approximately 0.30-m below ground surface and an underlying light brown (7.5YR6/4)
gravelly sand horizon. This basal unit was 0.20-m thick and also contained small-to-medium cobbles.
STP 6 was placed in between 41EP493 and 41EP494, in an area containing a collector’s pile (Isolated
Occurrence 23). Moreover, the location of STP 6 falls within the far eastern portion of O’Laughlin’s EPCM
33 South designation. This shovel test pit extended to a maximum depth of 0.40-m below ground surface
and consisted of a single deposit. Described as a gravel-laden sand matrix, this light brown (7.5YR6/3)
horizon was interpreted as slopewash originating from the dam apron. No cultural material was encountered
in STP 6.
STP 7 was excavated in the far southwestern margin of the survey parcel adacent to the carbon stain
(Isolated Occurrence 2) identified during the survey. Two strata were documented during the excavation;
each was interpreted as disturbed fill. The upper deposit is a very dark gray (5YR3/1) matrix with carbonstained sands and numerous gravels. This deposit reached 0.20-m below ground surface and contained two
pieces of burned amber beer glass. Underlying the upper deposit was a strong brown (7.5YR5/6) gravelladen sand loam horizon. This lower deposit was approximately 0.20-m thick and reached a depth of 0.40m below ground surface; a single piece of burned aluminum foil was recovered from this second deposit.
No other items were present in the excavation.
The final investigative phase, site evaluation, was focused on determining the contextual integrity and
information potential present at 41EP493 and 41EP494. Given the dubious nature of cultural resources
outside of the site areas and the lack of contextual integrity associated with those finds, identifying intact
deposits was critical in assessing the current NRHP status at 41EP493 and 41EP494; a key indicator of
intact deposits at each site was the presence or absence of features and site condition. As such, a more
regimented series of shovel tests and test excavations were carried out at both sites

MECHANICAL EXCAVATIONS
Following the completion of the shovel tests, 12 backhoe trenches and six 5-m by 5-m broad area scrapes
were excavated within the project area. Six backhoe trenches and two scrapes were carried out within
41EP493 and 41EP494, collectively. The remaining six trenches and four scrapes were completed in areas
outside of the two SALs, but within the project footprint.
Backhoe trenching and surface scrapes were used to further expose the stratigraphic sequence across the
project area and facilitate feature discovery in portions of the APE were the shovel test data were poorly
defined. Mechanical investigations consisted of 10 to 15-m long, and approximately 1.0-m wide, backhoe
trenches excavated in areas of accumulated sediments and Coppice-dune settings. Trench placement was
determined in conjunction with the project soil scientist. In each case, a single wall was profiled in cross
section; a 1.0-m window was provided a more critical examination by the soil scientist. In a similar
procedure, wide-area scrapes were placed in areas of accumulated sediments and Coppice-dune settings.
The scraped areas removed approximately 10-cm of overlying sediments and gravels to expose the
underlying deposits. Trench designation was continuous with Backhoe Trenches 7-12 reflecting
excavations outside of the two archaeological sites (Figure 5-13). Broad area scrapes taking place off-site
were designated as Scrapes 1, 4, 5 and 6 (see Figure 5-13). No buried cultural deposits were encountered
during the trenching and scraping process outside of 41EP493 and 41EP494.

and 41EP494.

Backhoe Trench 7
Backhoe Trench 7 was excavated in the central portion of the project area-south of the current 41EP494
site boundary, but within the southern half of O’Laughlin’s (1980) EPCM 34 South designation. This trench
measured 11-m long, was approximately 1-m wide, and reached a maximum depth of 1.15-m below ground
surface (Figure 5-14). The east wall profile revealed an upper deposit of extremely gravelly sand. This
overlying horizon was light brown (7.5YR6/4) in color, dry, and structureless. It extended approximately
0.40-m below the ground surface. Underlying the upper horizon was a compact light tan/brown (7.5YR6/3)
horizon. This stratum was 0.75-m thick and also contained a gravelly sand loam matrix with increased
pedigenic structure. No cultural deposits were encountered during the excavation of Backhoe Trench 7.
Backhoe Trench 8
Backhoe Trench 8 was placed approximately 50-m southeast of Backhoe Trench 7, also in the central
portion of the project area. This northeast/southwest oriented trench was 10-m long, 1.0-m wide, and
reached a depth of 1.10-m below ground surface. The west wall profile exposed an upper eolian horizon
that was light brown (7.5YR6/4) in color, dry, and structureless. This gravelly matrix extended 0.60-m
below the ground surface. At the base of Stratum 1 was a dark organic matrix that was intrusive into the
the underling light brown (7.5YR6/3) horizon. This deposit extended approximately 4.5-m horizontally and
0.42-m vertically. An examination of the fill revealed a charcoal laden refuse pit with modern debris. The
light brown matrix into which the refuse pit extended was approximately 0.40-m thick and contained a high
density of gravels. Beyond the modern debris, no cultural deposits were encountered during the excavation
of Backhoe Trench 8.
Backhoe Trench 9
Backhoe Trench 9 was excavated in the north-central part of the project area, 90-m northeast of Backhoe
Trench 8. This north/south oriented trench was 10-m long, approximately 1.0-m wide, and reached a depth
of 1.25-m below ground surface. The east wall profile exposed a cobble-laden upper eolian horizon that
was light brown (7.5YR6/4) in color with a clear mixture of gravels, loose sands, and alluvial sediments.
This gravelly matrix extended 0.50-m below the ground surface, and is in all likelihood, related to the
Keystone Dam support apron. Underlying this upper horizon was a gravel matrix described as light brown
(7.5YR6/4) in color; caliche nodules were present. No cultural deposits were encountered during the
excavation of Backhoe Trench 9.
Backhoe Trench 10
Backhoe Trench 10 was excavated in the northeast part of the project area, north of a two-track road. This
north/south oriented trench was 11-m long, approximately 1.0-m wide, and reached a depth of 1.20-m below
ground surface. The east wall profile exposed a four stratum soil profile. The upper most stratum was a
shallow eolian sand deposit with small gravels that ranged in depth between 0.10 and 0.20-m below ground
surface. The underlying stratum was described as a light brown (7.5YR6/4) gravelly matrix consistent with
much of the project area. Stratum III was a reddish brown (2YR4/4) clay matrix with few gravels that was
approximately 0.30-m thick. The basal Stratum IV was a light brown (7.5YR6/4) deposit intermixed with
cobbles and small gravels. No cultural deposits were encountered during the excavation of Backhoe Trench
10.
Backhoe Trench 11
Backhoe Trench 11 was excavated in the far southeastern part of the project area (Figure 5-15). This
north/south oriented trench was 12-m long, approximately 1.0-m wide, and reached a depth of 1.20-m below

ground surface. The east wall cross section revealed three strata in profile. The upper most stratum was a
shallow eolian sand deposit with small gravels that ranged in depth between 0.05 and 0.10-m below ground
surface. The underlying stratum was described as a gravelly light brown (7.5YR6/4) matrix. Stratum II was
approximately 0.60-m thick. Stratum III was a reddish brown (2YR4/4) gravelly clay mixed with light
brown (7.5YR6/4) sediments. Stratum III was approximately 0.50-m thick. No cultural deposits were
encountered during the excavation of Backhoe Trench 11.

Backhoe Trench 12
Backhoe Trench 12 was excavated in the southern part of the project area between 41EP493 and 41EP494.
This northwest/southeast oriented trench was 15-m long, approximately 1.0-m wide, and reached a depth
of 1.80-m below ground surface. Backhoe Trench 12 targeted Isolated Occurrence 16-a collector’s pile
identified along the southern margin of EPCM 33 South (O’Laughlin 1980). After the collector’s pile was
trowel tested, the backhoe was used to further explore the nature of the concentration; beyond the surface
scatter of artifacts, no buried cultural deposits were encountered.
The east wall cross section revealed a two strata soil profile. The upper stratum was an eolian sand deposit
with small gravels that reached an approximate depth of 0.50-m below ground surface. The light brown
(7.5YR6/4) sediments assigned to this stratum were anchored by mesquite–stabilized dunes resulting in a
thicker deposit. The underlying Stratum II was described as a sandy, strong brown loam (7.5YR5/6) matrix;
Stratum II was approximately 0.60-m thick. No cultural deposits were encountered during the excavation
of Backhoe Trench 12.
MECHANICAL SCRAPES
The mechanical excavations included four areas of broad-area stripping; all were 5-m by 5-m in size.
Mechanical Scrape 1 was placed along the north end of Backhoe Trench 12 and targeted Isolated
Occurrence 16-a collectors pile identified along the Coppice dune margins; no subsurface cultural deposits
were encountered. All cultural materials, which included pottery sherds, cores, and lithic debitage were
restricted to the surface. Mechanical Scrapes 2 and 3 were placed in sites 41EP493 and 41EP494 and
discussed in the subsequent sections. Mechanical Scrape 4 was placed in the north-central portion of the
site east of Backhoe Trench 9. Mechanical Scrapes 5 and 6 were excavated in the south-southeastern
sections of the project area; none of the scrapes revealed buried cultural deposits.

SITE NO. 41EP493 (KEYSTONE SITE 33, EPCM 33 SOUTH, STATE ARCHAEOLOGICAL LANDMARK)
Site Size (within the APE): 17,404.07 m2 (4.30 Acres)
Elevation: 1143.73 m (3752.40 Ft.)
Cultural Affiliation: Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, and Formative Period
State Archaeological Landmark 41EP493 is a high density prehistoric site with an intact middle Archaic
component. Most notably, 41EP493 contains circular-shaped structures dating between 2500 and 1800 B.C.
(O’Laughlin 1980; Carmichael 1985; Miller and Kenmotsu 2004). The majority of the SAL falls within the
protected Keystone Heritage Park and is outside the proposed APE. The portion of the site subjected to
testing and evalution measures 4.30 acres in size and lies at an elevation of 1143.73 m amsl. The floral
community includes mesquite, broom snakeweed, prickley pear cactus, and assorted grasses, all of which
contribute to a 75 percent site visibility. A total of 26 artifacts were documented during the site mapping
stage of this project. Based on the radiocarbon age estimates derived from the current testing phase, two
Archaic components are recognized for the site: 1) B.C. 2455-2290 and 2) B.C. 370-210. The earlier
estimate falls within the Keystone phase of the Middle Archaic and corresponds with earlier dates provided
by O’Laughlin (1980: 40). The second assay dates to the Late Archaic Hueco phase and provides insight to
occupations relating to the end of the Archaic period. As indicated by past investigations by Gerald (1976)
and O’Laughlin (1980), the current section of 41EP493 that falls within the APE exhibited contextual
integrity in the form of intact features and remnant Ab soil horizons noted in the central portion of the site
(Figure 5-16).
Previous Investigtions at 41EP493
The site was first documented during Gerald’s (1976) field investigations relating to the El Paso Flood
Control Project. The Keystone Dam area was one of five protection dams that were proposed for
development or improvement in west El Paso in the mid-1970s (Gerald 1976). Initially identified as
Keystone Dam Site 4, 41EP493 contained one possible pithouse, nine fire-cracked rock hearths, and a
dense array of ceramics (i.e., El Paso Brown, El Paso brownware, and Alma Plain), groundstone (i.e., mano
and a pestle), flaked-stone tools, and lithic debitage (Gerald 1976: 22). Gerald’s (1976:33) findings led to
an eligible recommendation for NRHP listing with avoidance as the primary resolution to mitigation.
Test excavations carried out by the University of Texas at El Paso (O’Laughlin 1980) at 41EP493 consisted
of a regimented series of exploratory techniques followed by more intensive hand excavation. Site 41EP493
was gridded at 16-m intervals, surveyed and mapped. The grid was then subdivided into 4-m subunits within
which artifacts were collected and surface features drawn in plan view. Subsequently, 84 auger cores were
placed across the site; transects were north-south in orientation and spaced at 2-m intervals. Eleven backhoe
trenches were excavated across the site revealing additional structures beneath the surface. Finally, 82 1-m
by 1-m test units were excavatated at the site (O’Laughlin 1980).
Excavation efforts revealed a five strata soil profile that reached a depth of just under 2-m below ground
surface. Evidence for preshistoric occupations was identified in Strata (i.e., Zones) 2-4 (O’Laughlin 1980;
Miller and Kenmotsu 2005; Vierra 2009). Zone 1 sediments are recent alluvial deposits and eolian sands
that intermittently cover the site. Zone 1 is more prominently displayed in and around mesquite anchored
dunes and to a lesser extent in open areas between dunes. Cultural deposits at 41EP493 were first identified
in O’Laughlin’s Zone 2, which in the absence of Zone 1, is exposed at ground level. Although Zone 2 was
documented up to 80 cm thick in 1980, it was expected that this zone will be much shallower due to erosion
and continual deflation. Zone 2 is described as an organic light brown loamy sand matrix (O’Laughlin
1980: 44). Zone 3 soils are sandy loams approximately 60 to 70 cm thick. Again, it is expected that this
stratum will be much thinner in the project area. Zone 4 is a relatively shallow sandy loam deposits, ranging
between 5 and 15 cm in thickness (O’Laughlin 1980: 46). Zone 5 consisted of alluvial gravels and sands,
with a higher clay content (O’Laughlin 1980; Vierra 2009).

As noted in O’Laughlin (1980); Miller and Kenmotsu (2005); and Vierra (2009), the resulting testing
strategy exposed cultural deposits in Zones 2-4. The upper deposits associated with Zone 2 dated between
A.D. 500 and 1500, a time span that encompasses the majority of the Formative period. Features assigned
to Zone 3 provided radiocarbon dates ranging between 300 B.C. and A.D. 400, a temporal range that covers
the Late Archaic Hueco phase and early Formative Mesilla phase. Radiocarbon samples recovered from
pithouse features in Zone 4 yielded an age parameter between 1500 and 2500 B.C.; this age range falls
within the Keystone phase of the Middle Archaic period (O’Laughlin 1980; Carmichael 1985; Miller and
Kenmotsu 2005; Vierra 2009).
The archaeological signature resulting from the testing process identified a minimum of 23 circular
pithouse structures associated with the Middle Archaic Zone 4. Fire cracked rock features, storage pits,
and artifacts further delineated this zone. Of the 23 structures, three were excavated and nine tested; the
majority of the remaining pihouses were documented at EPCM 33 North and are preserved within the
heritage park. Within O’Laughlin’s (1980) EPCM 33 South, which falls within the current APE footprint,
was a single structure. House 3 was identified in the northeast corner of EPCM 33 South and excavated by
O’Laughlin (1980: 140) (Figure 5-17). Based on O’Laughlin’s (1980) data, the Archaic aged structures
were, in all likelihood, cold-weather habitations reflecting multiple occupations and seasonal use episodes
(O’Laughlin 1980: 148). While numerous pithouse structures have been documented for the El Paso area,
few have been identified for the Middle Archaic period (Condon et al. 2010).

Later Formative period occupations at the site were evidenced by pottery sherds found primarily in the
northern portion of 41EP493 (O’Laughlin 1980; Carmichael 1985). The significance of 41EP493 (EPCM
North and South) is found in the level of preservation and the ability to provide critical data for a poorly
understood portion of regional prehsitory. To this end, the most concentrated areas of 41EP493 (EPCM 33
North) are preserved by the Archaeological Conservancy and the Keystone Heritage Park and are currently
north of the proposed APE footprint.

Current Investigations
In 2016, Versar carried out a site evaluation project at 41EP493 that encompassed 4.03 acres of the 29.10
acre development parcel. The site contained the southern portion of 41EP493, which subsumes much of
O’Laughlin’s EPCM 33 South designation (1980). The process consisted of site mapping, surface
inventory, shovel test excavation, mechanical trenching and scraping, and feature-oriented test unit
excavation. After the site was inventoried, artifacts and features documented, a series of 30 shovel test pits
were excavated across the site. Subsequent to the shovel test excavations were mechanical excavations.
Backhoe trenches were placed in areas likely to provide a complete soil sequence and yield information on
contextual integrity; using O’Laughlin’s soil sequencing as a guide, special attention was given to the Zones
2-4 soil units. The soil sequence for 41EP493 revealed deeply buried colluvial deposits with localized areas
of soil development. Areas retaining elements of EPCM 33 South and good contextual integrity were
identified in the central portion of the site covered by mesquite-stabilized dunes and grasses. The presence
of buried context reafirms the significance of the Keystone complex. In addition, one 5-m by 5-m scrape
was excavated at the site.
The core area retaining contextual integrity was documented and mapped using a Trimble Geo XT hand
held GPS unit. A datum, consisting of an iron rebar tagged with the site numbers was placed within the site;
the position of the datum was also recorded with a Trimble Geo XT GPS unit. All surface artifacts were
provided a point provenience and documented. Four surface features were identified, each was trowel tested
and examined for subsurface deposits.
Twenty-six artifacts, three surface features including one collector’s pile were documented during the
pedestrian survey (Figure 5-18). The artifact assemblage included a pestle fragment, a hammerstone, two
cores, two tested cobbles, two pieces of debitage, three metate fragments, seven mano and mano fragments,
and eight flaked-stone tools (Table 5-2). The collectors pile, one of a number identified throughout the site,
consisted of flaked-stone tools, groundstone fragments, and to a lesser extent lithic debitage. Pottery
included El Paso brownware, Chupadero Black-on-white, and Three Rivers Red-on-terracotta.
As demonstrated by the assemblage data, the artifacts reflect a range of functions-primarily relating to tool
production and resource processing. Absence is a clear presence of ceramic technology, which would
further establish a connection to resource storage and processing. The sherds within the collector’s pile, in
part, parallel ceramics documented by O’Laughlin (1980:150). While O’Laughlin (1980:152) identifies
only 138 total sherds from EPCM 33 South, the diversity warrants consideration. For instance, O’Laughlin
(1980:156) identifies 23 ceramic groups covering all phases of the Formative period. Included in the
assemblage are El Paso Brown, El Paso brownware, Mimbres Black-on-white, Alma Plain, Corrugated
brownware, possible San Francisco Red, and Rio Grande glaze wares. These pottery types do not differ
dramatically from what is present in the numerous collector’s piles, which may suggest that some of the
sherds were originally from 41EP493. However, the lack of context associated with these piles precludes
any possibility of establishing an association with the site.

The groundstone assemblage seems to correlate closely with O’Laughlin’s findings at EPCM 33 North and
South (1980:158). In 1980, 27 ground and pecked stone artifacts were documented, including manos,
metates, pestles, and anvils made from sandstone, quartzite, and limestone (O’Laughlin 1980:158). The
groundstone assemblage identified from the current evaluation process makes up 40 percent (n=10) of the
total assemblage assigned to the area of 41EP493 within the current APE. Metate fragments, manos, and
pestle fragments identified during the 2016 survey followed the previously established material trends with
sandstone, quartzite, and rhyolite; basalt seems to be the only outlier to the material pattern. One rhyolite
hammerstone was recorded by the Versar crew; O’Laughlin (1980:163) documents ten during the 1980
testing project.

Cores, tested cobbles, flaked-stone tools, and lithic debitage continue the material pattern recognized by
O’Laughlin (1980:165). Rhyolite, silicified limestone, quartzite, and chert make up the selection of material
types present in the current assemblage. Lithic debitage was entirely comprised of cortical flakes; cores and
tested cobles show minimal platform preparation and multiple striking angles. Flaked stone tools again
appear informal in their level of effort with choppers and unimarginally flaked stone fragments making up
the entirety of the subassemblage. None of the artifacts identified with 41EP493 were diagnostic. Temporal
settings were confirmed through absolute dating of features
The four surface features encountered in 2016 parallel the type and morphology revealed by O’Laughlin
(1980: 108) 36 years ealier. Small fire-cracked rock features and/or limited expanse fire-cracked rock
scatters are present with the APE. Three of the four features contain limestone or limestone/rhyolite
combinations; three retain good contextual integrity. An additional four features were exposed during the
5-22

Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest Municipal Service Center, El Paso County, Texas

subsurface testing. Feature 4 was a larger burned rock concentration targeted for excavation under Test
Unit 1. Feature 5 was partially exposed in Backhoe Trench 3 and is interpreted as basin-shaped pithouse.
This unique structure contained one post hole and was consistent with O’Laughlin’s (1980) pithouse
descriptions. Features 6 and 7 are small burned-rock hearths also exposed in Backhoe Trench 3.
Shovel Test Pit Excavations
Thirty shovel test pits were excavated across the portion of 41EP493 defined by the SAL and that fall within
the APE (Figure 5-19). Soil profiles were similar to those identified in other parts of the survey parcel and
generally consisted of gravelly colluvial deposits with little to no soil development. Excavations reached a
depth between 0.50 and 0.70-m below ground surface. Shovel test pits along the site’s western margin
ranged in depth from 0.40-m to 0.70m below ground surface. Shovel Tests 1 and 8 revealed a two stata soil
sequence, while STPs 2-7 showed evidence for only one stratum (Figure 5-20).
The soil sequence for STP 2 and 8 included a very light blanket of eolian sediments (7.5YR5/4, brown) that
was sporadically spread across the shovel test transect. These sediments correlated with O’Laughlin’s
(1980) Zone 1 designation and were associated with areas of vegeation and shallow dune development.
Stratum I reached a depth of 0.20-m below ground surface. Underlying Stratum I (Zone 1) was a light
brown (7.5YR6/3) gravelly sand deposit. This stratum aligns with O’Laughlin’s (1980) Zone 2 designation.
All sediments were screened using 1/8-inch hardware mesh. Stratum II was approximately 0.30-m thick.
No artifacts were present in these STPs.
In contrast, STPs 2-7 exhibited a single stratum. Stratum I (Zone 1) was a very gravelly sand deposit, light
brown (7.5YR6/3) in color. This stratum aligns with O’Laughlin’s (1980) Zone 2 designation. All sediments
were screened using 1/8-inch hardware mesh. Attesting to the colluvial movement of sediments, recent
cultural materials were recovered from STPs 2, 3, and 5. Amber colored beer bottle glass was encountered
between 0.40 and 0.50-m below ground surface in STP 2. Modern brick fragments were recovered
throughout the 0.50-m deep STP 3. Amber beer bottle glass was recovered from the upper portion (~10-m
below ground surface) of STP 5; an aluminum pull tab was recovered at the base of the same shovel test
(0.60-m below ground surface). No other materials were present in this transect.
Transect 2 contained nine shovel tests and crossed the western margin of the core area of 41EP493. Shovel
Test 9 was placed in the northern margin of mesquite and grass-stabilized landform and revealed two strata.
Stratum I was eolian in nature and consisted of a 7.5YR6/3 (light brown) sand horizon with few gravels.
Aggregation was attributed to vegetation; transport was interpreted as wind blown rather than colluvial.
Stratum I extended approximately 0.10-m below ground surface. Stratum II was the consistently present
gravel-filled colluvium (7.5YR6/3) assigned to O’Laughlin’s (1980) Zone 2 soil sequence. This STP 9
terminated at 0.50-m below ground surface; no artifacts were encountered. Shovel Tests 10-16 exhibited
similar soil profiles with only one stratum present. Absent was the surface related eolian deposit, leaving
the gravelly colluvial deposit exposed. This colluvium horizon extended between 0.50 and 0.70-m below
ground surface on Transect 2. Consistently described as a 7.5YR6/3 deposit, this stratum contained gravels
intermixed withi sandy loam. Medium-sized cobbles were more prevelant in the upper portions of the STPs;
asphalt and concrete fragments were encountered at a depth of 0.20-cm below ground surface in STPs 11
and 16.
Shovel Test 17 was excavated in the southern margin of the transect and revealed a reddish-brown (5YR5/4)
sandy clay deposits exposed at ground suface. This STP extended to a depth of 0.50-m below ground surface
at which point the soils became increasingly wet. A moderate density of gravels was noted in the soil matrix.
Concrete, pieces of plastic, and black electrical tape were identified to a depth of 0.50-m below ground
surface.

Transect 3 contained STPs 18-25 and bisected the core area of 41EP493. Shovel Tests 18 and 21 revealed
a two strata soil sequence. Stratum I was described as a light brown (7.5YR6/3) sandy loam with gravels.
This stratum is interpreted as O’Laughlin’s (1980) Zone 2 deposit. Stratum I reached a depth of 0.40-m
below ground surface. For STP 18, the upper stratum contained a mixture of both modern debris and
prehistoric artifacts. Artifacts included fire-cracked rock and a single flake. Modern materials included
earthenware and clear bottle glass. Shovel Test Pit 21-Stratum I contained three pieces of fire-cracked rock.
The underlying Stratum II was described as a strong brown (7.5YR5/6) matrix with fewer gravels. Stratum
II was 0.30-m thick and terminated at 0.70-m below ground surface. Within both STP 18 and 21, a single
piece of fire-cracked rock was recovered from Stratum II. No artifacts were present in STPs 22 and 23.
Interestingly, STP 24 contained clear bottle glass shards in the upper 0.20-m of the STP and asphalt at a
depth of 0.50-m below ground surface.
Shovel Test Pits 19, 20, 22, 23, and 24 contained similar soil sequences. A single stratum was recognized
for each shovel test that consisted of a very gravelly sand deposit, light brown (7.5YR6/3) in color. This
stratum aligns with O’Laughlin’s (1980) Zone 2 designation and reached a depth between 0.50 and 0.60-m
below ground surface. Cultural materials recovered fom STP 19 included one utilized flake fragment and
one piece of fire-cracked rock. One Mimbres Black-on-white pottery sherd and two pieces of fire-cracked
rock were recovered in the first 0.20-m of STP 20. Both STP 19 and 20 fall within the core area 41EP493.
Shovel Test Pit 25 was excavated along the margin of the mesquite-stabilized area of 41EP493. A single
stratum was recognized for this STP which consisted of a reddish brown (5YR5/4) sandy clay matrix with
few gravels. Stratum I reached a depth of 0.50-m below ground surface and is interpreted as a more recent
fill deposit associated with a drainage channel installed during the Keystone Dam construction era. Towards
this end, brick and plastic fragments, electrical tape, amber beer bottle glass, and cement were consistently
encountered during the STP excavation.
Transect 4 contained five STPs. Shovel Test Pit 26 was excavated east of STP 25 and exhibited a similar
soil profile- a single reddish brown (5YR5/4) sandy clay deposit with few gravels. This shovel test was
excavated to a depth of 0.35-m below ground surface before reaching an impasse. No artifacts were present
in this STP. Moving north, STP 27 presented a single compact strong brown (7.5YR5/6) sandy loam deposit
with dense gravels. This shovel test was excavated to a depth of 0.30-m below ground surface before
reaching an impasse; no artifacts were present. Shovel Test Pit 28 contained a reddish-brown (5YR5/6)
sandy loam matrix. A decrease in gravels was noted for this 0.50-m deep STP; no artifacts were recovered.
Shovel Test Pit 29 was excavated in the core area of 41EP493, and in contrast to the sterile STPS on
Transect 4, yielded subsurface artifacts. A single stratum reaching a depth of 0.80-m below ground surface
was documented in STP 29. This light brown (7.5YR6/3) matrix with few gravels produced artifacts at a
depths ranging between 0.20 and 0.30-m and 0.50 and 0.60-m below ground surface. A single piece of
debitage was recovered from the upper portion of the STP. A single flake fragment and mano fragment
were recovered from the lower portions of the shovel test.
Shovel Test Pit 30 was the northern-most STP on Transect 4 and revealed a single stratum of light brown
(7.5YR6/3) sandy loam with gravels. This STP reached a depth of 0.40-m below ground surface before
hitting an impasse. No artifacts were recovered from STP 30.
Mechanical Excavations
The mechanical excavations at 41EP493 included three linear backhoe trenches and one 5-m by 5-m scrape
judgmentally placed across the site (Figure 5-21). The trenches, labeled Backhoe Trenches 1-3 were
approximately 1-m wide and reached depths of approximately 1.0-m below ground surface. All mechanical
exavations were conducted in conjunction with the project soil scientist. Backhoe Trench 1 was a
northwest/southeast oriented trench placed along the western margin of the mesquite-stabilized zone of
41EP493 (Figure 5-22). This trench was 11 m in length and exposed three soil units. The upper stratum is

related to eolian sediements and was approximately 0.10-m in depth. The underlying stratum consisted of
a sandy-gravelly deposit that was interpreted as more recent slopewash and colluvial deposition. Stratum II
was also about 0.10-m in thickness. Stratum III was consistent in texture throughout the remainder of the
1.25-m deep trench. Described as an extremely gravelly light brown (7.5YR6/3) deposit, Stratum III is
interpreted as a thick colluvial horizon. The exposed east wall profile in Backhoe Trench 1 was consistent
with the soil sequences exposed during the shovel test pit excavations. No cultural deposits were
encountered in this backhoe trench.
Backhoe Trench 2 was excavated in the northern portion of 41EP493. This northeast/southwest oriented
trench was 12-m long, approximately 1.0-m wide, and reached a depth of 1.10-m. The upper deposit,
Stratum I, was eolian in nature and was approximately 0.10-m in depth. Stratum II consisted of a sandygravelly deposit that was interpreted as more recent slopewash and colluvial deposition. Stratum III was
consistent in texture and content throughout remainder of the 1.10-m deep trench. Described as an
extremely gravelly light brown (7.5YR6/3) deposit, Stratum III was interpreted as a thick colluvial horizon.
No cultural deposits were encountered in Backhoe Trench 2.
Backhoe Trench 3 was exavated in the central portion of 41EP493. This north/south oriented trench was
12-m long, approximately 1.0-m wide, and reached a depth of 1.56-m (Figure 5-23 and Figure 5-24). This
trench exposed a series of five soil units and three intact features (Figure 5-25). Stratum I was a gravelly
light brown/tan (7.5YR6/3) surface deposit that was associated with eolian aggregation and colluvial
slopewash. Sediments associated with Stratum I were loosely consolidated with little pedigenic structure.
Stratum I reached a depth of 0.20 below ground surface. Underlying Stratum I was Stratum II, a dark gray
(7.5YR3/1) sandy loam deposit, that was interpreted as a highly organic anthrosol. Stratum II was
approximately 0.20-m thick and rested upon a brown (7.5YR5/3) sandy loam designated as Stratum III.
The northern portion of Stratum III was a truncated arroyo channel labeled Stratum IV. The channel cuts
downward to the north incising Stratum V, a light tan (7.5YR6/3) sand and gravel deposit. Features 4, 6,
and 7 were exposed at the base of Stratum II and were intrusive into Stratum III. Feature 5 was identified
at the base of Stratum III and was intrusive into Stratum V.
Mechanical Scrape 2 was placed in the northwest portion of 41EP493 on the margin of the mesquitestabilized landform. The scrape measured 5-m by 5-m in size and removed the upper 0.10-m of gravel filled
sediment. No buried cultural deposits were encountered during the scraping process, which was completed
approximately 40-m northwest of Backhoe Trench 3.

Manual Excavation
With the completion of the mechanical trenching and scraping process, a single excavation unit was placed
over the eastern half of Feature 4, a fire-cracked rock hearth (Figure 5-26). Test Unit 1 captured the south
half of Feature 4 leaving the north half intact (Figure 5-27). Feature 4, exposed during the excavation of
Backhoe Trench 3, exhibited evidence of intact buried deposits in the form of partially exposed burned rock
and wood charcoal fragments. The excavation of Test Unit 1 initiated with the removal of the remaining
over the overlying Stratum I and II soils, which were screened through 1/8-inch hardware mesh as a natural
level. The removal of these sediments revealed an oval-shaped cluster of fire-cracked rock within a matrix
of carbon stained sediments. Further excavation of the unit was teminated with full exposure of Feature 4.

In addition, a second smaller burned rock hearth was revealed in the southeast corner of the test unit. Feature
7 was exposed 0.40-m east of Feature 4 and was not excavated.

Feature 4
Feature 4 was a clearly defined, oval-shaped fire cracked rock concentration within a fill matrix of motteled
carbon-stained sediments. This feature measured 1.66-m by 1.82-m in dimension (Figure 5-28). The
exposed cross section of the feature showed a basin-shaped profile consisting of a layer of carbon-stained
sediments overlying a steep-sided pit (Figure 5-29). The feature reached a maximum depth of 0.40-m with
the main pit area being 0.18-m deep. Two correlating zones were identified. The upper stained sediments
of Zone 1 were dark gray (7.5YR3/1) in color with minimal fire-cracked rock fragments.

Figure 5-28. Plan view of Test Unit 1 and Features 4 and 7 and east wall cross section of Feature
4.
The underlying pit contained Zone 2, a black (7.5YR2.5/1) charcoal rich fill matrix, intermixed with firecracked rock. Zone 1 contained two El Paso Brownware sherds and six piece of debitage.
A single wood charcoal sample was collected from the Zone 2 feature fill and submitted for AMS
radiocarbon analysis. The sample yielded a conventional age of 2230+/-30 B.P and a 2-sigma calibrated
age range of B.C. 385 to 200 (Beta 433961). The calibrated age estimate falls within the Late Hueco phase
of the Archaic period.

Feature 5
Feature 5 was a partially exposed linear feature identified at the Stratum 3 and Stratum 5 interface. Feature
5 was revealed in the cross section of Backhoe Trench 3 and revealed a saucer-shaped profile that reached
a maximum thickness of 0.52-m. A single post hole extend 0.12-m below the feature floor; the post hole
contained charred wood fragments. The base of the feature contained a lense of black (7.5YR2.5/1) sandy
loam mixed with wood charcoal. Feature 5 is interpreted as a 2.20-m in length pithouse similar in form to
structures documented by O’Laughlin’s (1980). No cultural materials were recovered and no further
investigations were carried out beyond documentation.
A single wood charcoal sample was collected from the post hole and submitted for AMS radiocarbon
analysis. The sample yielded a conventional age of 3870+/-30 B.P and a 2-sigma calibrated age range of
B.C. 2465 to 2210 (Beta 433961). The calibrated age estimate falls within the Keystone phase of the Archaic
period and correlates to dates assigned to the middle Archaic pithouse structures identified by O’Laughlin
(1980).
Feature 6
Feature 6 was a small circular-shaped hearth identified within the cross section of Backhoe Trench 3.
Positioned immediately south of Feature 4 at the base of Stratum 2, Feature 6 measured approximately
0.50-m in diameter and reached a depth of 0.20-m below the top of the brown sandy loam matrix of Stratum
3. The cross section of this feature revealed a basin-shaped profile with a dark gray (7.5YR3/1) matrix. No
cultural materials were recovered and no further investigations were carried out beyond documentation.

5-34

Feature 7
Feature 7 was a small circular-shaped hearth identified in the southeast corner of Test Unit 1. Feature 7
measured approximately 0.60-m by 0.60-m in size; the full extent of the feature is unknown as the boundary
moved past the confines of the 2-m by 2-m test unit. Feature fill consisted of a mottled dark gray (7.5YR3/1)
ashy matrix and contained a moderately dense concentration of fire-cracked rock. Beyond documenting
Feature 7 in plan view, this feature was left intact. As the two features are immediately adjacent one another,
it can be tentatively assumed that Feature 7 is contemporaneous with Feature 4. No cultural materials were
recovered from Feature 7 and no further investigations were carried out beyond documentation
Site Summary and NRHP Recommendation Statement
The section of 41EP493 (EPCM 33 South) that falls within the APE contains the core remnants of
O’Laughlin’s (1980) EPCM 33 South designation. The APE subsumes 4.30 acres (17,404.07 m2) of the
current SAL boundary designation. Within the 4.30 acre is a core segment of 41EP493 that retains
contextual integrity and buried cultural deposits that correlates with O’Laughlin’s (1980) site
documentation. This core area lies in the mesquite-stabilized portion of 41EP493 and covers 2,000 m2 (0.49
acres). Seven features were documented in the core area, of which six retain contextual integrity; two
yielded radiocarbon assays. The artifact assemblage documented for the site reveals a low density scatter
that primarily occurs outside of the core area. Within the core area artifacts are recovered from buried
context and reflect an early Formative presence. Based on the stratigraphic relationship between Stratum
II, the anthrosol, and Feature 4, it is suggested that the anthrosol may be a later development occuring after
the abandonment of Feature 4. The presence of Mimbres Black-on-white pottery from STP 20 further
suports the presence of a post-A.D. 200/400 presence at the site. Formative period activity is also
documented by O’Laughlin (1980). The Late Archaic occupation dates to the Hueco phase and is supported
by the Feature 4 calibrated age range of B.C. 385 to 200. Based on the spatial relationship, it can be proposed
that Features 6 and 7 may be contemoraneous with Feature 4. Middle Archaic activity is defined by a
partially exposed pithouse similar in outline to those previously recorded (O’Laughlin 1980). Feature 5
dates between B.C. 2465 and 2210.
The remainder of 41EP943 outside of the half-acre core exhibited a general absence of cultural activity and
failed to demonstrate contextual integrity. Artifacts were predominantly associated with areas of deflation.
The STPs in many cases showed disturbed context outside of the core area. Based on these findings, areas
of 41EP493 which lie outside the half-acre core, do not contribute to a broader understanding of the regional
prehistory. As such, these areas do not contribute to the NRHP standing and are recommended ineligible
for NRHP listing.
In contrast, the 2,000 m2 core area defined by the presence of buried features and contextual integrity
preserves the remaining portions of EPCM 33 South. This core area presents a unique opportunity to
preserve an intact stratigraph sequence identified with the Middle Archaic period in general, and in
particular, structural remains from the Keystone phase, a period of immense regional significance. These
cultural remains strengthen O’Laughlin’s (1980) earlier contribution and reinforce the critical nature of this
portion of the SAL.
Site 41EP494 is a limited density artifact scatter that reflects the remnants of O’Laughlin’s (1980) EPCM
34 North. With two exceptions, the cultural materials assigned to this site are surface finds with little
contextual integrity. The four surface artifacts, a pestle fragment, a mano, a unimargially flaked piece of
debitage, and a flake, cannot be assigned a particular period of occupation and are lacking contextual
integrity. Subsurface finds include one chalcedony flake fragment from STP 1 and a single chert utilized
flake fragment from STP 4; both lacked associated context. In the instance of STP 4, amber beer bottle
glass was recovered in association with the lone prehistoric artifact. The soils documented at the site
primarily consist of colluvial deposits with little soil development. The noted presence of gravels and
cobbles point toward sediment movement from the Keystone Dam apron, and in the case of the large

5-35

Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest Municipal Service Center, El Paso County, Texas

cobbles, possible colluvial movement from the Franklin Mountains. In combination, these factors suggest
that the current portion of 41EP494 that lies within the proposed APE footprint no longer retains
archaeological significance. It is therefore recommended not eligible for NRHP listing.

SITE NO. 41EP494 (KEYSTONE SITE 34, EPCM 34 NORTH, STATE ARCHAEOLOGICAL LANDMARK)
Site Size (within the APE): 4,585.27 m2 (1.13 Acres)
Elevation: 1140.89 m (3743.10 ft.)
Cultural Affiliation: Archaic and Formative Period
Site 41EP494 is a State Archaeological Landmark that measures 16,703 m2 in total size; only 4,585 m2;
however, lie within the current project area (Figure 5-30). The 12,118 m2 that fall outside of the current
APE are not included in future development plans, and thus retain their SAL status, and remain eligible for
inclusion into the NRHP. The following discusion references only the 4,585 m2 that are within the current
APE. The evaluation process consisted of site mapping, artifact inventory, shovel test excavation, backhoe
trench excavation, and broad-area scraping. A datum, consisting of iron rebar, taggged with site numbers
was placed in the site; it’s location was recorded with a sub-meter Trimble GeoXT GPS unit.
Site 41EP494 is contained within low-lying mesquite-stabilized dunes, deflation basins, and shallow,
gravelly sand sheets. The site topography slopes gently westward with larger open areas largely devoid of
vegetation characterizing the majority of the site. Site visibility approximates 80-percent. In addition,
several two-track roads presently impact 41EP494.
Only four artifacts were present in the site area during the pedestrian survey; the inventory effort was
intensive and comprehensive and included post-survey mapping that closely examined the 4,585 m2 parcel.
The artifact assemblage included a schist pestle fragment, an unbroken limestone mano, a flaked-limestone
tool, and a single chert flake (Table 5-3). As demonstrated by the assemblage data, the artifacts reflect a
range of types, each generally singular in function. The assemblage point toward processing of resources
rather than procurement or storage. None of the artifacts are diagnostic, and collectively, suggest a fraction
of the larger occupational event described in O’Laughlin (1980). Given the surficial relationship, the point
of origin for these artifacts may lie within those sections of 41EP494 that are outside the project area.
Despite a small sample group, the diversity in material type may indicate access to, and exploitation of, Rio
Grande cobbles and Franklin Mountain colluvium.
Previous Investigtions at 41EP494
Site 41EP494 was documented by Gerald (1976) as part of the the El Paso Flood Control Project. Adjacent
to 41EP493, Gerald (1976) designated this smaller prehistoric site Keystone Dam Site 5 (EPCM 34). IN
1976, 41EP494 measured only 140-m by 52-m in size and covered 4,264 m2 in area (Gerald 1980: 22). The
cultural signature included two partially buried hearths, two El Paso Brown sherds and one flaked stone
tool (Gerald 1976: 22). Gerald’s (1976: 34) findings led to an eligible recommendation for NRHP listing
with avoidance as the primary resolution to mitigation.
Subsequent test excavations carried out by the University of Texas at El Paso (O’Laughlin 1980) at
41EP494 consisted of a regimented series of exploratory techniques followed by more intensive hand
excavation (Figure 5-31). The terrace upon which 41EP494 was situated was gridded at 16-m intervals,
surveyed and mapped. The grid was then subdivided into 4-m subunits within which artifacts were collected
and surface features drawn in plan view. Based on the artifact/feature distribution, 41EP494 was divided
into two segments-a north and south half separated by an arroyo. Auger cores were placed across each
section of the site; transects were north-south in orientation and spaced at 2-m intervals. In addtition, one
backhoe trench was excavated in the north half of the site; two trenches were placed in the south half.

Finally, 14 1-m by 1-m test units were excavatate at 41PE494 (O’Laughlin 1980: 33). As a result of the
intensive investigation, 41EP494 was expanded to cover 16,703 m2 in size.

Despite being in proximity to 41EP493, O’Laughlin’s (1980: 47) documented site stratigraphy revealed
only three strata, with the lowest terminating with exposed caliche bedrock between 1.0 and 1.5 m below
ground surface. From upper to lower, Stratum I sediments reflected recent alluvial deposits and eolian
sands. Stratum II ranged in thickness from 5 to 15-cm and was described as a light gray-to-brown colored
sand matrix. Cultural deposits at 41EP494 are present in O’Laughlin’s Zone 2, which are documented in
both the north and south halves of the site (1980: 43). Zone 2 generally correlates with the current Stratum
II of this project. Stratum III soils are sandy loams approximately 40 cm thick. Stratum III deposits contain
a mixture of gravels and colluvial sediments; thickness increased from north to south (O’Laughlin 1980:
47). No subsurface cultural deposits were identified at 41EP494 that were not already indicated at the
surface level.
The results of the 1980 testing strategy identified several small fire cracked rock features, one large fire
cracked rock feature, and a light scatter of ltihic debitage, and ceramic sherds. Evidence for contextual
integrity is minimal; however, radiocarbon assays from two features indicate an A.D. 250+/-140 and A.D.
820+/-130 occuaptional events (O’Laughlin 1980: 48). These age estimates point toward an early Formative
period-Mesilla phase site occupation.
Interestingly, while O’Laughlin (1980: 246) identifies 41EP494 as significant, no primary stategy for
preservation was presented. In fact, O’Laughlin (1980) suggests that the cultural signature and level of
integriy may not warrant further preservation efforts. Moreover, the cultural deposits do not seem to parallel
the Archaic occupational events present at 41EP493.
Current Investigations
Upon completion of the site mapping, Versar initiated the testing stage of the project. Testing consisted of
the excavation of shovel test pits, backhoe trenches, and broad-area scrapes. The level of effort assigned
to 41EP494 included 13 shovel test pits, three trenches, and one 5-m by 5-m scrape. Backhoe trenches were
placed in locations likely to provide a complete soil sequence and provide a more accurate assessement on
contextual integrity. The soil sequence for 41EP494 revealed deeply buried colluvial deposits and little soil
development. The general lack of intact strata suggests that 1) buried cultural deposits may exist deeper
than the explaratory trenching or 2) the remnant portions of 41EP494 are no longer present. As previulsy
stated, all surface artifacts were documented, provided a point provenience, and mapped. Despite the past
identification of features by O’Laughlin (1980), no features were present during the current investigation.

Shovel Test Pit Excavations
Thirteen shovel test pits were excavated across the current site boundary (Figure 5-32). Soil profiles at the
site consist of gravelly colluvial deposits with minimal soil development. Excavations reached a depth of
0.70-m below ground surface in the western portion of the site. In the eastern portion of the site, which
overlies O’Laughlin’s (1980) EPCM 34 North, excavations reached 0.50-m below ground surface. As noted
by O’Laughlin (1980), cultural deposits recorded at 41EP494 were visible at the surface level. To be clear,
Stratum II geneally correlates to O’Laughlin’s (1980:47) Zone 2 designation, documented in the southcentral portion of the EPCM 34 North and north-central portion of EPCM 34 South (Figure 5-33). Zone 2
ranged in thickness between 0.05 and 0.15-m and was intermittently covered by the loose eolian sands of
Zone 1 (O’Laughlin 1980: 47). Given the high degree of erosion and general shallowness of Zone 2, it
would appear that many of the features identified 36 years ago are no longer present at the site.

Figure 5-33. Selected shovel test pit profiles from 41EP494.
Four shovel test pits were excavated along the western margin of the site. The excavations were used to
determine if 41EP494 contained, or had the potential to contain, buried cultural deposits. Althought the
termination depth varied between 0.50 and 0.70-m below ground surface, the four shovel test excavations
revealed similar soil sequences. The soil sequence included a very light blanket of eolain sediments
(7.5YR7/6, reddish yellow) that was sporadically spread across the shovel test transect. These sediments
correlated with O’Laughlin’s (1980) Zone 1 designation. Underlying Versar’s Stratum 1 (Zone 1) was a
very gravelly sand deposit, light brown (7.5YR6/3) in color. This stratum aligns with O’Laughlin’s (1980)
Zone 2. The current depth of Stratum 2 (Zone 2) extended to a depth of 0.70 below ground surface. All
sediments were screened using 1/8-inch hardware mesh. Cultural materials were recovered from STP 1 at
a depth 0.20-0.30-m below ground surface and STP 4 at a depth of 0 to 0.30-m. A single chalcedony flake
5-41

Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest Municipal Service Center, El Paso County, Texas

fragment was collected from STP 1, while a possible utilized flake fragment and three pieces of ambercolored beer glass were encountered in STP 4. No other other artifacts were present in these STPs or in
STPs 2 and 3.
The second transect covered the central portion of 41EP494. The soil profiles for STPs 5, 6, and 8 were
similar in sequence. Again, a very shallow mixture of eolian sands and gravels (7.5YR7/6, reddish yellow)
covered the underlying Stratum II. This second stratum consisted of a gravelly sandy matrix (7.5YR6/3,
light brown) that extended to a depth of 0.50-m below ground surface; Stratum II contained no cultural
materials.
In contrast, STP 7 contained a three strata profile. Missing was the overlying eolian sediment layer
consistently identified with 41EP494. Stratum I was an extremely gravelly light brown (7.5YR6/3) deposit
that reached a depth of 0.05-m below ground surface. This stratum is correlated with Versar’s Stratum II
and O’Laughlin’s (1980) Zone 2 and contained no artifacts. Underlying Stratum I was a reddish yellow
(7.5YR6/6) sandy loam deposit with few gravels designated as Stratum II. These two strata were separated
by a distinct uncomformaty that suggests an erosional event followed by a period of colluvial aggegation.
Stratum II was approximately 0.30-m thick. Stratum III contained a light brown gravelly sand matrix
(7.5YR6/3) interpreted as a colluvial deposit with little structure. No artifacts were recovered from STP 7.
Moving east to the third transect are STPs 9-11. STP 9 contained two primary horizons, both gravelly
colluvial deposits. The upper stratum contained extremely gravelly light brown sand (7.5YR6/3) that
extended 0.20-m below ground surface. Stratum 2 was a gravelly sandy loam (7.5YR6/4) deposit that
included larger cobbles. Stratum II was 0.30-m in thickness and terminated 0.50-m below ground surface.
The addition of larger cobble suggests that Stratum II may relate to and earlier colluvial event, one that
predates Stratum I (Zone 2), and that draws from the parent material of the Franklin Mountains. No cultural
materials were recovered from STP 9.
Shovel Test Pits 10 and 11 also contained gravels intermixed with larger cobbles, but lacked the distinct
stratum separation. For STPs 10 and 11, a single stratum extended 0.50-m below ground surface. Stratum
I was an extremely gravelly sandy loam (7.5YR5/4, brown) with larger cobbles present in the matrix. Again,
the intermixing of sediments, gravels, and cobbles suggests that the colluvial deposits present in these
excavation pits may relate to an earlier depositional event predating the construction of Keystone Dam. No
cultural materials were recovered from STPs 10 and 11.
Finally, STPs 12 and 13 investigated the far eastern extension of 41EP494. Both STPs contained similar
soil sequences that did not differ from those in the western portion of the site. Shovel test Pits 12 and 13
were placed among mesquite-stabilized dunes and each reached a depth of 0.50-m below ground surface.
A single stratum was identified in the shovel test pits. Stratum I was an extremely gravelly sandy loam
(7.5YR5/4, brown) martrix with larger cobbles. No cultural materials were recovered from STPs 12 and
13.
Mechanical Excavations
The mechanical excavations at 41EP494 included three linear backhoe trenches and one 5-m by 5-m scrape
judgmentally placed across the site. The trenches, labeled Backhoe Trenches 4-6 were approximately 1-m
wide and reached depths of approximately 1.0-m below ground surface (Figure 5-34). All mechanical
excavations were conducted in conjunction with the project soil scientist. Backhoe Trench 4 was a
northwest/southeast oriented trench placed in the west side of 41EP494. This trench was 16.5-m in length
and exposed two soil units. The upper stratum is related to eolian sediements and was approximately 0.05m in depth. The underlying stratum consisted of a sandy-gravelly deposit that was consistent in texture and
structure throughout the one-meter deep trench.

Figure 5-34. Cross section profiles from selected off-site backhoe trenches.
Described as an extremely gravelly light brown (7.5YR6/3) deposit, Stratum II is interpreted as a thick
colluvial horizon. The exposed northwall profile in Backhoe Trench 4 was consistent with the soil
sequences exposed during the shovel test pit excavations. No cultural deposits were encountered in this
bakhoe trench.
Backhoe Trench 5 was excavated in the eastern portion of 41EP494. This north/south oriented trench was
11-m long, approximately 1.0-m wide, and reached a depth of 1.0-m. The upper deposit, Stratum I, was
eolian in nature, and was approximately 0.05-m in depth. Stratum II consisted of a sandy-gravelly deposit
that was consistent in texture and content with Backhoe Trench 4. Stratum 2 was an extremely gravelly
light brown (7.5YR6/3) deposit. No cultural deposits were encountered in this bakhoe trench.
Backhoe Trench 6 was exavated in the south-central portion of 41EP494. This northwest/southeast oriented
trench was 11.5-m long, approximately 1.0-m wide, and reached a depth of 1.0-m. The upper deposit,
Stratum I, was eolian in nature and was approximately 0.08-m in depth. Stratum 2 consisted of a sandygravelly deposit that was consistent in texture and content with Backhoe Trenches 4 and 5. Stratum II was
an extremely gravelly light brown (7.5YR6/3) deposit. No cultural deposits were encountered in this
backhoe trench.

Site Summary and NRHP Recommendation Statement
Site 41EP494 is a limited density artifact scatter that represents the remnants of O’Laughlin’s (1980) EPCM
34 North. With two exceptions, the cultural materials assigned to this site are surface finds with little
contextual integrity. The four artifacts, a pestle fragment, a mano, a unimargially flaked piece of debitage,
and a flake, cannot be assigned to a particular period of occupation and are lacking contextual integrity.
Given the collection piles observed southwest of the site, one cannot rule out the possibility that these
artifacts are not originally from 41EP494. Subsurface finds include one chalcedony flake fragment from
STP 1 and a single chert utilized flake fragment from STP 4; both lacked associated context. In the instance
of STP 4, amber beer bottle glass was recovered in association with the lone prehistoric artifact. The soils
documented at the site primarily consist of colluvial deposits with little soil development. The noted
presence of gravels and cobbles point toward sediment movement from the Keystone Dam apron, and in
the case of the large cobbles, possible colluvial movement from the Franklin Mountains. In combination,
these factors suggest that the current portion of 41EP494 that lies within the proposed APE footprint no
longer retains archaeological significance. It is therefore recommended that the portions of 41EP494 that
fall within the APE are not eligible for NRHP listing.

CHAPTER 6.
ADDRESSING THE HISTORIC CONTEXT OF THE MIDDLE
AND LATE ARCHAIC PERIOD
The 6000 year Archaic period presents the longest span of human occupation within the region, a period of
time that is defined in large part by an absence, rather than the presence, of select technologies. The general
absence of ceramic technology is contrasted by a diversity of projectile point styles that change within the
archaeological record between 6000 B.C. and A.D. 200/400 (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004, Condon et al.
2010). Within the Jornada Mogollon region, the Archaic period has encompassed three primary phases:
early, middle, and late, each with assigned subdivisions. The traditional hierarchy consists of the Gardner
phase (6000-4000/3000 B.C.) of the early Archaic followed by the Keystone phase (4000-2500 B.C.) and
Fresnal phase (2500-900 B.C.) of the Middle Archaic. The Late Archaic period has a single subdivisionthe Hueco phase (900 B.C. to A.D. 200/400) (MacNeish 1993).
Within the models proposed by MacNeish (1993), is a consistency of high mobility, seasonal-focused
settlement patterns that are interpreted as highly mobile, technologically adaptive, and effectively
responsive to changing environments. For the Middle and Late Archaic, both represented in the current
project, regional intensification is tentatively supported by an increase in the quantity of sites dating to these
periods. Increased site presence is equated to a rise in population with probable overlapping and reuse of
site areas. This is evidenced at 41EP493 with the high number of structures and dense artifact assemblage.
Along these lines, house structures appear in the archaeological record for the first time during the Middle
Archaic period. Critical to this period is the Keystone phase defined by the Keystone site. O’Laughlin’s
(1980) investigations are paramount to understanding the poorly defined Middle Archaic period; the current
findings contribute to this effort.
The subsequent Late Archaic is characterized by an increasingly diversified economy, centralized-base
camps that support logistical exploitation of seasonally productive habitats (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004).
This pattern is generally supported by the high frequency of Hueco phase occupations in a variety of
environments, indicating expanded land-use patterns (Condon et al. 2010). Feature 4 and potentially
Features 6 and 7 date to the Hueco phase of the Late Archaic period.
However, this expanded presence of Middle and Late Archaic sites may reflect periods of punctuated
intensification and equally critical periods of diminished land use. This pattern is generated by an
examination of 3,800 radiocarbon dates that point toward shifts in social organization and subsistence
adaptation over a 5000 year span (Miller and Graves 2015). Using the data derived from the radiocarbon
analysis, Miller and Graves (2015) proposed a revision of the traditional cultural sequencing for the Jornada
Mogollon region (Table 6-1) .
For the Middle Archaic, Miller and Graves (2015) suggest that the socio-organization patterns identified
with the Fresnal phase more firmly align with those of the Late Archaic period. In addition, Miller and
Graves (2015) move to include a new subdivision in the Middle Archaic period with the introduction of the
Tularosa phase (4000-2500 B.C.). Cultural traits associated with the Tularosa phase include the introduction
and/or increased use of burned-rock baking pits with discard middens. Utilization of rockshelters is also
included in this phase and tends to support the baking pit subsistence model as these feature types are often
positioned along upland environmental settings. The following Keystone phase (2500 to 1500 B.C.) differs
in the extent that burned rock baking pits are utilized. Punctuated increases in plant processing demarcates
this early stage of the phase followed by dramatic decrease in these feature types at the end of the phase.
Rockshelter use appears to also decrease while the construction and habitation of shallow pithouses are
introduced providing a relatively new signature for the Middle Archaic period. For the current project,

Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest Municipal Service Center, El Paso County, Texas

Feature 5- a pithouse dating between 2465 and 2210 B.C., falls squarely within Miller and Graves (2015)
revised sequencing.
For the subsequent Late Archaic period, Miller and Graves (2015) chronometric model provides a threephase cultural sequence consisting of the previously mentioned Fresnal phase, the newly added Arenal
phase, and the traditional Hueco phase. The Fresnal phase (1400 to 750 B.C.) is generally defined by a
continuation of pithouse structures. Difference emerge in a significant increase in the frequency of burned
rock baking pits, use of rockshelters, and the construction of storage pits. This phase also exhibits a steady
increase in small hearth use. The newly added Arenal phase (750 to 300 B.C.) highlights a 500-year shift
in landscape utilization that reflects, according to Miller and Graves (2015), a distinct change in mobility
and resource exploitation. A return to a higher mobility settlement strategy is evidences by a decrease in
residential-clustered communities, less frequent occurrence of burned rock baking pits, and a near absence
of storage pits construction and rockshelter use. Small hearth construction continues to occur in high
frequencies, suggesting that populations are not only decreasing, but moving across the landscape more
regularly. The impetus for this shift is clearly environmental, at least in in part. Other influencing factors
may include territorial and social complexities, as well as, religious complications.

Graves 2015).

The Hueco phase (300 to A.D. 500) aligns with Feature 4, and in all likelihood Features 6 and 7, and
presents a return to demographic intensification for the region. Environmental stabilization for the terminal
Archaic is reinforced by an increase in burned-rock baking pit features, burned-rock middens, storage pits,
pithouse structures, and small hearth development (Miller and Graves 2015). As noted by Miller and Graves
(2015), intensively occupied village settlements appear during this period, and spatial arrangements of
houses, and communal areas are common elements of these settlements.
In regard to Miller and Graves (2015) phase restructuring, it is important to keep in mind that interpretations
involving Archaic period have been traditionally contentious due in part to a scarcity of chronometric
evidence. While MacNeish (1993) has been the standard in interpreting sites dating to the Archaic period,

6-2

Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest Municipal Service Center, El Paso County, Texas

the accumulation of new data facilitates change to the existing paradigm. This is not to diminish previous
contributions, on the contrary, the process of change is enabled by the foundation of past interpretation.
The evidence recovered during the evaluation process at 41EP493 and 41EP494 falls into this revisionist
effort, where previous interpretations are strengthened at one level and amended on another level. The
chronometric data recovered from 41EP493 tends to support Miller and Graves (2015) revised temporal
sequence and strengthen O’Laughlin’s (1980) interpretation of the Keystone complex. In contrast, the lack
of contextual integrity at 41EP494 points toward a change in preservation and modification to the
recommended NRHP status. Overall, the evaluation project provided an opportunity towards understanding
Archaic-aged hunter-gatherer socio-organization, a critical element in interpreting early cultural systems in
the Jornada Mogollon region.

CHAPTER 7.
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This section describes the summary and proposed treatment strategies for the anticipated development of
the Northwest Municipal Service Center and how the anticipated construction activities will affect 41EP493
and 41EP494. For each site, the field strategy is outlined. As such, the treatment strategies include: 1) site
overview; 2) site specific problems; 3) plans of action presented; 4) application of plans of actions; 5)
Versar recommendations.
41EP493: SITE OVERVIEW AND NRHP RECOMMENDATION
State Archaeological Landmark 41EP493 is a stratified site located on the distal alluvial fans emanating
from the Franklin Mountains. While the entirety of 41EP493 encompasses 10.20 acres (41,277.93 m2),
only 4.50 acres (18,210.85 m2) falls within the current APE of the Northwest Municipal Service Center.
The site is fenced along the Keystone Heritage Park boundary creating an arbitrary division between service
center property and lands owned by the City of El Paso. Impacts to the site within the APE are evidenced
by open space indicating eolian deflation and sheetwash erosion. Impacts have been accelerated by access
roads and installation of a buried drainage system along the southern boundary of 414EP493. Of the 4.50
acres (18,210.85 m2) within the APE, 0.50 acres (2,023.42 m2) have been identified as containing significant
intact archaeological deposits (Figure 7-1). During the testing process, a total of seven features were
documented-all within the 0.50-acre core area of 41EP493. Three mechanical trenches and one 5-m by 5m scrape, each comprising 25 m2, were judgmentally places across the site. Backhoe Trench 3 exposed
Features 4-6. One test unit, representing 4 square meters of excavation, was placed over Feature 4 revealing
a fire cracked rock feature with associated pit. Feature 4 is assigned a Late Archaic age dating to the Hueco
phase with a calibrated age range of B.C. 385 to 200. Feature 6 was a small hearth that in all likelihood is
contemporary to Feature 4; Feature 6 was not excavated. Middle Archaic activity is supported by an buried
pithouse dates between B.C. 2465 and 2210. Three mechanical trenches and one 5-m by 5-m scrape, each
comprising 25 m2 were excavated at the site; Backhoe Trench 3 exposed Features 4-6. Thirty shovel test
pits were excavated across APE related portions of 41EP493; evidence of buried cultural materials were
encountered within the core site area strengthening the interpretation of intact buried context.
A total of 26 artifacts were identified along the surface of 41EP493; none contributed to the temporal setting
of the site. Diagnostic artifacts recovered during the subsurface testing included El Paso brownware sherds
and a single Mimbres Black-on-white sherds both assignable to the Mesilla phase (A.D. 200/400 to
1000/1100) of the Formative period. The presence of well-preserved cultural deposits coupled with
excellent chronometric data indicates that 41EP493 can continue to significantly inform on the middle and
Late Archaic periods and contribute meaningful information to the regional prehistory.
Site Specific Problems
Two interrelated problems are noted at 41EP493: the general absence of intact cultural deposits outside of
the half-acre core and the occurrence of significant cultural deposits beneath the surface.

Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest Municipal Service Center, El Paso County, Texas

Figure 7-1. Map showing the proposed core area within 41EP493.

7-2

Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest Municipal Service Center, El Paso County, Texas

Beyond the core area, surface manifestations appear artificially clustered and out of context. This
distribution is most visible along open terrain northwest of the core area and within the collector’s piles
noted at the site. An inverse relationship between context and visibility is present within the core area. Few
artifacts were noted within the half-acre core. This anomaly is explained, in part, by the vegetation that
obscures surface artifacts, but more accurately that cultural deposits remain buried beneath the surface.
Unlike the artifacts documented on the surface, these buried deposits, in all likelihood, retain contextual
integrity. Two buried cultural deposits are present in the core area. The upper Late Archaic deposits are
associated with a buried anthrosol and occur within the first 0.30 to 0.40-m below the ground surface. The
middle Archaic component is visible at approximately 1.0-m below ground surface. Based on the results
of the shovel tests, test units, and mechanical trenching, the half-acre portion of 41EP493 has the highest
probability of containing these earlier deposits. Proposed development would potentially impact these
deposits and adversely affect the integrity of the archaeological remains.
The identification of a middle Archaic pithouse within the APE points toward a more substantial residential
event. Given the 23 structures documented by O’Laughlin (1980; EPCM 33 North and South), there is a
high likelihood that additional residential structures area present within the core area of 41EP493. As
residential communities grow and become more populated, the possibility of exposing human burials
increases. Although the possibility is less than certain, the presence of human burials poses a problem of a
sensitive nature that will need to be addressed prior to implementing any development plans.
Alternative Plan 1: Avoidance of the Core Area
Alternative Plan 1 involves the preservation of the half-acre core area of the APE related to 41EP493.
Preservation involves the avoidance of the 0.50 acre parcel of through fencing, and subsequently, site burial.
The development plan for Northwest Municipal Service Center would need to be restructured to preserve
this portion of the site. Under this alternative, it is recommended that the core area be temporarily fenced
to restrict activity to the area during the service center development. Long term avoidance of the core area
may not be sustainable. Versar respectfully suggests the possibility of donating the core area to the
Archaeological Conservancy currently aligned with the Keystone Heritage Park or creating a green-space
park out of the half-acre parcel. Toward this end, Versar advises that the 0.50 acre parcel be trimmed of
vegetation and covered with soil fabric. Subsequently, up to 1.0 m of fill dirt be layered over the area to
promote stabilization and preservation. Afterwards, the 0.50 acre area would be developed for nonintrusive activities (e.g., small park area).
The remainder of the site (all portions outside of the core area), but within the APE and on City of El Paso
owned lands, fail to contribute to the State Archaeological Landmark significance or to the NRHP eligibility
recommendation. No further archaeological investigations are recommended for areas outside of the half
acre core. However, monitoring by a trained archaeologist is suggested when construction is occurring
adjacent to the core area.
Alternative Plan 1: Advantages
The primary advantage of Alternative Plan 1 is avoidance and preservation of the core area of 41EP493.
As demonstrated during the testing and evaluation process, the core area contained intact buried cultural
components. Avoidance of this area would preserve significant cultural components present within this
portion of 41EP493. Monitoring and stewardship are suggested in combination with site burial.
Alternative Plan 1: Concerns
Alternative Plan 1 raises the following concerns: 1) estimated loss of 0.50 acre, 2) added costs to redesign
the development footprint of the Northwest Municipal Service Center around the core area, and 3) added
costs to design and implement the soil capping and implementation of sustainable green space. If
Alternative 1 was to be pursued, then a course of monitoring would need to be implemented when
construction crews were in the vicinity of the core area.

Alternative Plan 2: Comprehensive Data Recovery
Alternative Plan 2 is more aggressive towards data recovery and does not present preservation as a viable
solution to mitigating the proposed adverse effect to 41EP493. Under this alternative, systematic
archaeological excavation would be proposed, specifically targeting features within the 0.50-acre core area.
Data recovery would focus on feature excavation, geomorphological trenching, and broad area stripping.
Excavation would target the upper and lower cultural components present in this portion of 41EP493.
Application of Alternative Plan 2
Alternative Plan 2 involves the comprehensive data recovery of the core area of 41EP493. Under this
alternative plan, archaeological excavation would be proposed and implemented to retrieve information
necessary for regional and project specific research design issues from the entirety of the core area. Data
recovery would include the development of research design and mitigation plan to be approved by the THC.
Extensive artifact collection, manual excavation of features, and mechanical excavation strategies (i.e.,
trenching and wide area stripping) are to be implemented. A combination of mechanical and hand
excavation would target the upper Late Archaic components. Overlying soil units that cover the middle
Archaic components would be stripped down to fully expose the cultural landscape. All features exposed
during the mechanical excavation stage of the date recovery will be documented and systematically
removed by hand.
Alternative Plan 2: Advantages
The primary advantage of Alternative Plan 2 is that avoidance and preservation are no longer concerns. By
enacting an aggressive data recovery strategy, the informational potential present at 41EP493 is recovered,
in effect mitigating the data potential of the site. This mitigation strategy allows for relatively unrestricted
development of the Northwest Municipal Service Center.
Alternative Plan 2: Concerns
Alternative Plan 2 raises the following concerns: 1) the cost of the excavation in relation to the preservation
of the core area (0.50 acres), 2) possible scheduling delays with the exposure of additional features (e.g.,
pithouses), 3) delays in relation to the exposure human burials, and 4) the broader scheduling of the service
center development.
Versar Recommendation
Versar recommends Alternative Plan 1: preservation of core area and monitoring of areas adjacent the 0.50
acre parcel. Under Alternative Plan 1, the most significant portions of the State Archaeological Landmark
(i.e., EPCM 33 South) would be protected. The remaining portions of the site that lack contextual integrity
and no longer contribute to the SAL status would be released from additional archaeological investigations;
monitoring notwithstanding. Consequently, the preservation plan requires the City of El Paso to have a
long-term strategy to protecting the core area during and after the course of the project.
41EP494: SITE OVERVIEW AND NRHP RECOMMENDATION
Site 41EP494 is a limited density artifact scatter that represents the remnants of O’Laughlin’s (1980) EPCM
34 North. With two exceptions, the cultural materials assigned to this site are surface finds with little
contextual integrity. The four artifacts, a pestle fragment, a mano, a unimargially flaked piece of debitage,
and a flake, cannot be assigned a particular period of occupation and are lacking contextual integrity. Given
the collection piles observed southwest of the site, one cannot rule out the possibility that these artifacts are
not originally from 41EP494. Subsurface finds include one chalcedony flake fragment from STP 1 and a
single chert utilized flake fragment from STP 4; both lacked associated context. In the instance of STP 4,
amber beer bottle glass was recovered in association with the lone prehistoric artifact. The soils documented
at the site primarily consist of colluvial deposits with little soil development. The noted presence of gravels

7-4

Cultural Resources Survey and Limited Testing at the Proposed Northwest Municipal Service Center, El Paso County, Texas

and cobbles point toward sediment movement from the Keystone Dam apron, and in the case of the large
cobbles, possible colluvial movement from the Franklin Mountains. In combination, these factors suggest
that the current portion of 41EP494 that lies within the proposed APE footprint no longer retains
archaeological significance. It is therefore recommended not eligible for NRHP listing.
Site Specific Problems
The remnants of 41EP494 include portions of O’Laughlin’s (1980) EPCM 34 North. However, current
investigations did not identify evidence of intact cultural deposits. Surface manifestations were few in
number and removed from the original context. As such, the portion of 41EP494 that falls within the APE
fails to contribute to the current SAL standing. Moreover, O’Laughlin’s (1980) EPCM 34 South lies outside
the current SAL boundary. Again, the landscape is deflated and eroded and holds little evidence of
contextual integrity. Beyond monitoring, nor further archaeological investigations are recommended in
relation to those portions of the APE that relate to 41EP494.
Summary
The purpose of this project was to identify the significance, integrity, and condition of SALs 41EP493,
41EP494, and any other cultural deposits within the 29.10 acre parcel proposed for development. During
the project, those portions of the SALs that extended into the APE were evaluated as were the portions of
the parcel outside of the SALs. While isolated occurrences were identified outside of the SALs, no other
archaeological sites were encountered. Moreover, no evidence for buried deposits were identified beyond
the limits of the SALs. No further work is recommended in these areas.
While the two SALs offered information, only 41EP493 presented significance in the form of content,
location, and condition. SAL 41EP493 retained a core area 0.50-acres in size that contained significant
cultural deposits meriting strong preservation efforts. Within the core area, intact prehistoric features date
to the middle and Late Archaic period and present the opportunity to expand upon O’Laughlin’s (1980)
seminal work on regional Archaic populations. However, only this small portion of 41EP493 currently
contributes to the site’s SAL status. The site retains its eligible recommendation for NRHP listing. Towards
this end, site management recommendations include:
1. Preservation of the 0.50-acre core of 41EP493. Preservation would initiate with fencing off the core
area while development of the service center is underway.
2. Monitoring the use of heavy equipment and construction crews in areas adjacent to the core area
of 41EP493.
3. Development of the 0.50-acre into green space park or other low maintenance area. Development
would focus on capping the 0.50-acres with fill and constructing a non-invasive green space or
park.
4. Scheduled monitoring or stewardship of the site area to ensure that cultural deposits remain
preserved and undisturbed.
5. Removal of the SAL designation from the portion of 41EP494 that is in the current APE.
Concurrence with an ineligible recommendation for this same portion of 41EP494. It is
recommended that the information potential of 41EP494 (APE limited) has been exhausted through
documentation, and no further work is merited.
