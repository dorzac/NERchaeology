Management Summary
Fairfield Lake State Park occupies 1,460 acres in Freestone County, approximately five miles
northeast of Fairfield, Texas. The land was leased by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD)
from Luminate Power (formerly Texas Utilities) in the 1970s. Under provisions of the Texas Antiquities
Code, TPWD is responsible for managing cultural resources on park land. In an effort to compile an
inventory of sites in the park, a cultural resource survey was conducted by Stephen F. Austin State
University (SFA) in 1996 under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 1698, granted to Dr. James E. Corbin.
The SFA team recorded or revisited a total of 34 sites in the park’s 1,460 acres, though never completed
a final report. In 2008, TPWD contracted the Center for Archaeological Studies at Texas State
University-San Marcos (CAS) to complete this earlier project. Working under contract with TPWD
and the reactivated Permit No. 1698, CAS revisited and reassessed the 34 recorded sites, recorded an
additional site, 41FT630 – an abandoned historic cemetery - and finalized the analysis and curation
of all documents and artifacts recovered in 1996 and 2008. After the completion of the 2008 project,
it was unclear whether or not the entire 1,460 acres of the park had been included in the survey, and
whether the list of 35 sites represented all of the cultural resources that were present in the park.
Following the 2008 reassessment, TPWD contracted CAS to carry out a systematic survey
of the 1,460-acre park, excluding previously recorded sites, inundated terrain, and areas of modern
disturbance that resulted from park infrastructure developments. The purpose of the survey was to
ensure a complete inventory of cultural resources within the park. The effort included pedestrian
survey and excavation of 215 shovel tests, as well as archival research to identify historic structures that
may have once been present, but that were now razed and that could be considered potential sites. An
additional element of this project involved some archival research to determine whether 41FT630, the
abandoned cemetery, had ever been platted at the Freestone County Clerk’s office, as required under
Chapter 711 of the State of Texas Health and Safety Code. Archival and field work was performed
in April and May of 2009 by Julian A. Sitters, Project Archaeologist, Sarah Scogin, CAS Staff
Archaeologist, and Jon C. Lohse, who served as Principal Investigator. No new sites were recorded
during this project, and CAS found no indication that 41FT630 has ever been platted. Available records
indicate that it likely represents a freedmen descendant community cemetery, containing individuals
who were probably slaves or immediate descendants of freed slaves. CAS recommends archaeological
survey and oral interviews concerning this site before it is legally platted at the County Clerk’s office
in Fairfield, Texas.

inundated and steeply sloping terrain, and areas of
disturbance and construction) in order to provide
a verifiably complete inventory of historic and
prehistoric sites. The purpose of this work, in
conjunction with the previous survey, is to assist
TPWD in developing a site management plan in
the event of future developments within the park
boundaries. Additionally, recommendations
concerning site 41FT630 are intended to help
TPWD protect this site in accordance with State
of Texas Health and Safety Code requirements
governing cemeteries, specifically Chapter 711.
Archival and field work was accomplished in
April and May, 2009 under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 5203, issued to Jon C. Lohse.

This report presents the results of a cultural
resource survey and archival investigation
conducted at Fairfield Lake State Park (park), in
Freestone County, Texas (Figure 1-1). Previous
investigations of the park were performed in
1996 by students of Stephen F. Austin University
(SFA), under the direction of Dr. James E.
Corbin. Unfortunately, Dr. Corbin passed away
before that project and its report were ever
completed. In 2008, Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department (TPWD) contracted with the Center
for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State
University-San Marcos to compile notes, field
and artifact photographs, and site forms that
were generated during that survey in order to
complete the SFA project. This task involved
revisiting each of the 34 sites that had been
recorded in the park. A 35th site, 41FT630, an
abandoned historic cemetery, was recorded in
the process (Yelacic et al. 2008). Because of the
status of field records from the SFA project, it
was not possible to know for certain whether
those students systematically covered the
entire park area, or whether they preferentially
focused on what may have been perceived as
high probability areas. Consequently, it was not
known with confidence whether the inventory of
35 documented sites in the park could be viewed
as a complete record of cultural resources that
were present, and for which TPWD personnel
were responsible under the Texas Antiquities
Code. Following the 2008 CAS survey (Yelacic
et al. 2008), TPWD contracted CAS to carry out
a systematic and complete survey of the 1,460acre park (excluding previously recorded sites,

are expected. Any resources determined to be
significant must then be avoided, protected, or
their destruction mitigated by approved data
recovery programs. Certain State agencies, such
as TPWD, are proactively compiling inventories
of cultural resources on their properties and for
which they are responsible in order to assist them
with their management responsibilities under the
Code.

For this project, Dr. Jon Lohse served as
Principal Investigator; he also participated
in the fieldwork on a limited basis. CAS Staff
Archaeologist Julian A. Sitters was Project
Archaeologist and supervised the day-to-day
field work. Sitters was assisted by Sarah Scogin,
CAS Staff Archaeologist.

Worthiness for designation as a SAL is
defined in the Code:
Archeological sites may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated
as State Archeological Landmarks, provided
that at least one of the following conditions
is met (Rules and Practice, Chapter 41:10):

Archaeological Site Evaluation
Criteria
Although there are no immediate plans to
develop the archaeological sites identified within
the park, guidelines set forth by state and federal
agencies for State Archeological Landmark
(SAL) and National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) eligibility were used as a rubric
for determining site significance. Cultural
resources located on land owned or controlled
by the State of Texas or its political subdivisions
are protected by the Texas Antiquities Code
(Code) (Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9,
Chapter 191), which classifies all sites as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs). Should any
historic or prehistoric sites located on land that
is designated for impact during development be
determined eligible for formal designation of
landmark status under the Code, some measure
of protection or mitigation of impact may be
necessary. The formal designation of SALs and
their administration is the responsibility of the
Texas Historical Commission (THC).

The archeological site is situated on land
owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one
of its political subdivisions; [and then]
(A) preservation of materials must be
sufficient to allow application of standard
archeological techniques to advantage;
and/or
(B) the majority of artifacts are in place so
that a significant portion of the site’s
original characteristics can be defined
through investigation; and/or
(C) the site has the potential to contribute
to cumulative cultural history by the
addition of new information; and/or
(D) the site offers evidence of unique or rare
attributes; and/or
(E) the site offers a unique or rare opportunity
to test techniques, theory, or method of
preservation, thereby contributing to
scientific knowledge.

The Code generally requires that a complete
archaeological survey be undertaken in
conjunction with projects which fall under its
purview, particularly in previously unsurveyed
areas and in regions where cultural resources

cultural resources may be protected by federal

law, primarily by the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, which is
invoked when federal funds are utilized or when
federal permitting is required for a proposed
undertaking. The NHPA created NRHP, and
states that the Advisory Council for Historic
Preservation (ACHP) must be afforded the
opportunity to comment when any cultural
resources potentially eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP are present in an area affected by
federal agency actions, or by any actions funded
or permitted by federal agencies. The federal
regulatory process is described in detail in the

Project Area Setting

help of annual burns and ecological restoration
projects (personal communication 2009).

Freestone County occupies 892 square miles
in northeast Central Texas. The eastern border
of the county is demarcated by the Trinity River,
and the project area, Fairfield Lake State Park,
is located at the confluence of Big Brown Creek
and Little Brown Creek, secondary tributaries of
the Trinity River.

Fairfield Lake
In the late-1960s, Dallas Power and Light
Company, Texas Electric Service Company, and
Texas Power and Light Company acquired land
at the confluence of Big Brown and Little Brown
Creeks in order to construct the Big Brown
Steam Electric Station (Jansinski 2002). Plans
for construction included creating a 2,500-acre,
15 billion gallon lake, which would be used to
cool the two generators. Before the Big Brown
Steam Electric Station was erected in 1969, Big
Brown Creek was dammed. Big Brown Creek, a
secondary tributary of the Trinity River, flows
from its headwaters northeast for approximately
20 miles to where it empties into the Tehuacana
Creek, a primary tributary of the Trinity River.

Post Oak Savannah
As recently defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the
United States Geographic Survey (USGS), and
other federal and state agencies using a fourtiered hierarchical framework with climate,
vegetation, physiography, and other biotic and
abiotic phenomena taken into consideration,
Fairfield Lake State Park lies within the Level
III ecoregion East Central Texas Plains (Griffith
et al. 2004) (Figure 2-1). As described by Fields
(1995) and supported by Griffith et al. (2004), the
East Central Texas Plains, also referred to as the
Post Oak Savannah, separates the prairies to the
south, north, and west from the Piney Woods to
the east. Accordingly, this region is a transitional
one consisting of irregular plains and containing
stands of pine trees intermixed with hardwoods
such as mesquite, oak, and hickory. However,
much of the area now encompassed within
the state park was once modified as pasture or
farmland. According to park ranger Don Boyd,
once the area was leased by TPWD much of
the land returned to its natural setting with the

Sediments
Soils in the project area have been mapped
and described by Janak and Griffin (2002)
(Figure 2-2). Units include Edge fine sandy loam,
5 to 12 percent slopes (EgE); Nahatche-Hatliff
association, frequently flooded (NH); Rader fine
sandy loam, 5 to 12 percent slopes (SaE); Silstid
loamy fine sand, 1 to 5 percent slopes (SsB);
Silstid loamy fine sand, 5 to 8 percent slopes
(SsD); and Tabor fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent
slopes (TaB). Depending on series, soils in the
region can be classified as A-Bt-C (Ege/TaB), ACg (NH), and A-E-Bt (SaE/SsD).

Most of these soil associations are found
on flat to nearly flat terrain. However, the high
sand content leaves topsoil deposits vulnerable
to runoff and erosion during even light-tomoderate rainfall events. Typical soil depths are
often shallow, averaging from as little as 7.6 cm
in depth (SaE) to approximately 66 cm (SsD).
Subsoils are very often high in clay content,
which causes surface water to pool in spite of the
permeability of the topsoils. These soils support
a limited range of uses, the most notable of which

are as pasture and agricultural lands. Salt domes
in the southern part of Freestone County (Janak
and Griffin 2002:116) are associated with some
oil and natural gas production. Additionally,
lignite coal deposits are present in the region and
have been actively mined for the past several
decades and up to the present.

Cultural Disturbances

composition within the park area, topsoils are
continuously impacted by erosion and runoff.
Park construction and maintenance also
influences poor site preservation. Road, park
building, campground, and pipeline construction
has disturbed a substantial amount of area within
the park. Finally, prior to the development of
the park, the area was cleared of any standing

Cultural materials within the confines of
the park have been affected by multiple natural
and artificial factors over the years that have
seriously impacted the integrity of many of the
sites that are present. The most common and
ongoing cultural disturbance within the park
is erosion. As a result of the sandy sediment

structures or obstructions which were thought to
potentially pose a hazard to the public. Historic
structures, stock pens, and old fence lines, which
stood prior to the opening of the park, were
systematically dismantled (Jasinski 2002:77) and
either removed from the park or relocated and
buried. This information was confirmed by Park
Ranger Don Boyd (personal communication,
2009). These factors have contributed to the poor
archaeological site preservation within the park.

due to the mobile nature of early populations
and the dispersive quality of culture. Division
within the prehistoric occupation of the region is
not meant to indicate discrete temporal units in
the region’s cultural chronology. Dates provided
are approximated in radiocarbon years before
present (B.P.).

Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period, as seen in divisions
of Central Texas Cultural chronology as predating
8,800 years B.P., is hardly visible in northeast
Central Texas’ material record. It is represented
by scattered, isolated finds of temporally
diagnostic dart points including Clovis, Folsom,
and Angostura (Meltzer and Bever 1995; Story
1965). Paleoindian discoveries in the region are
typically surficial, but they do exist and have
been found in subsurface contexts (Fields 1995,
2004; Richner and Bagot 1978). Unfortunately,
the subsurface discoveries show evidence of
disturbance representing either post-depositional
erosional movement or later population’s interest
in archaeology. The lack of available evidence
from the region results in reliance on general
trends in Paleoindian populations provided by
studies of the earliest occupants in Central and
East Texas.

Cultural Chronology for Northeast
Central Texas
Abundant waterways and fertile land have
long lured human occupation to northeast Central
Texas. The rich human occupation of the region,
divided into prehistoric and historic components,
is presented in the following paragraphs.

Prehistoric
Previous investigations have shown that the
greater east Central Texas region shares cultural
affinities with Central Texas, East Texas, and
north Central Texas (Bruseth and Moir 1987);
diagnostic artifact types from each of these three
regions can be found here. In terms of prehistoric
occupation, the Post Oak Savannah region is
best known for its Late Archaic and post-archaic
Woodland adaptations (Fields 1995). Although
some findings dating to the Paleoindian and
Early/Middle Archaic periods are present,
these tend to be scarce. The following cultural
chronology of the Prehistoric period is based
on the research and interpretations of Dee Ann
Story (1965) and Ross C. Fields (1995, 2004).
A compilation of their data divides the region’s
prehistoric occupation into four periods whose
titles reflect the overlapping of neighboring
regions: Paeloindian, Archaic, Woodland, and
Late Prehistoric. Supplementing the cultural
chronology of northeast Central Texas with
comparisons of adjacent cultures is necessary

A large distribution of Clovis points across
North and Central America suggests a wide
dispersal of their makers (Wenke 1990:201).
Meltzer and Bever (1995) documented the
presence of 406 Clovis points at 128 of the 254
counties in Texas. These early populations in
Texas were most-likely small groups of highly
mobile, specialized hunter-gatherers. Herds of
megafauna and the availability of edible flora are
the assumed forces behind the migration of early
populations toward the plains of northeast Texas
(Perttula 1995, 2004).

8

Archaic

Woodland

Archaeologists’ ability to clearly discern
differences between traditional Archaic
components (i.e. early, middle, and late subperiods) is often hindered by a number of factors.
These include the sandy nature of regional
sediments, which facilitates the translocation of
artifacts beyond original component boundaries
and therefore obscures otherwise stratified
deposits; the deflated nature of many upland
settings; and the generally poor temporal
resolution of diagnostic artifact types (Fields
1995). In general, however, the long Archaic
occupation (ca. 8,800 to 1,200 years B.P.) of the
region is characterized by the gradual emergence
of strongly localized cultural traditions; overall
reduction in annual and seasonal mobility; an
apparent diversification of subsistence resources
in response to increasing fluctuations of climate,
available moisture, and plant and animal
communities; and a corresponding diversification
of regional artifact styles and technologies that
were designed to exploit this quickly changing
environment.

Woodland adaptations appear not only in the
study area by approximately 1,800 years B.P., but
also across the greater Trans-Mississippi south
of the southeastern United States (Story 1965).
This period is characterized by the introduction
of ceramics (in some areas); partial reliance
on cultigens, particularly as a complement
to seasonally available foraged goods; more
prolonged stays at certain locales; social and
ritual elaboration; and, later on, the introduction
of the bow and arrow. The adoption of ceramic
technologies by approximately 1,700 years
B.P. implies increasing emphasis on storage of
certain foodstuffs. Early vessels are thick and
have only simple surface treatments. Temper
materials frequently utilized include sand or
clay, bone, and grog. Gary points, with sharply
triangular blades, contracting stems, and strong
shoulders are perhaps the most common point
type. Woodland adaptations are more clearly
distinguished to the east of the study area, though
many of the traits just described are found in
Freestone County.

Story (1965) describes Archaic sites as
having a high percentage of expedient cutting/
scraping tools and rectangular/expanding
stemmed, temporally diagnostic dart points.
Burned rock features also appear in association
with Archaic sites. Sites studied in northeast
Central Texas show a concentration of lithic
material around burned rock middens and/or
hearths, but the environment does not support
preservation of floral and faunal remains (Fields
1995, 2004). Evidence suggests that Archaic sites
in the region, though slightly and understandably
deflated, are in their original context. These sites
indicate short-lived, isolated occupations and
suggest that their inhabitants were still mobile
hunters and gatherers.

While postholes are evidence of increasing
intensity and longevity of site use, postholes, or
possible postholes, and intrusive pits associated
with Woodland deposits occur in low numbers.
The presence of cultivated botanical remains
would suggest that the economy of this time
period was transitional, however, the lack of
prominence in the organic material record
indicates that the populations did not significantly
rely on horticulture (Fields 1995:307). The
increase in domestic activities represented in the
material record from Woodland cultural deposits
are evidence of increasing population densities,
decreasing mobility, and the multi-seasonal use
of sites, which Fields (1995:307) describes as
“residential bases” (Perttula 1990:276-277, cited
in Fields 1995).

Late Prehistoric

Caddoan groups in the Piney Woods and Red
River regions are considered to have more
complex social systems than the populations in
this region (Fields 1995; Perttula 1995).

The Late Prehistoric period occupies the time
from ca. 1200 years B.P. to ca. 500 years B.P.
(Fields 1995, 2004; Story 1965). The introduction
of the bow-and-arrow, the intensification of food
production, and the elaboration of architectural
forms and ceramic technologies define the Late
Prehistoric period. It is notable that despite the
prominence of arrow points, dart points continue
to be recovered from this period’s cultural
deposits, suggesting that atlatl and bow-andarrow technologies overlap (Fields 1995:310).
Structures of this time period are more common.
Postholes indicate sub-rectangular to rectangular
shaped structure, and at some sites, postholes
overlap indicating multiple construction events
(Fields 1995, 2004). Intrusive pits, hearths, trash
middens, and burials associated with remnants
of structures are evidence of increased domestic
activity and the spatial distribution of intrasite
activities (Fields 1995). Botanical remains from
cultivated species, as well as foraged species,
are present in association with Late Prehistoric
cultural deposits and are evidence of an increased
reliance on horticulture (Fields 1995, 2004).
However, the botanical evidence still indicates
that these populations relied mainly on wild plant
food. Despite the more dominant structures,
spatial patterning of activities, and evidence
of increased horticulture practices, there is no
evidence supporting year-round, sedentary
occupations of this region’s populations during
the Late Prehistoric period (Fields 1995). Ceramic
technology of this period continues to advance
and plays a more prominent role in the culture.
Although sherds recovered at many sites are too
small to indicate any specific type of vessel, a
low percentage does reveal some important
stylistic innovations. Decoration including neckbanding, incision, engraving, punctation, and
pinching show evidence of trade with and/or
cultural influence from Caddo neighbors to the
north and east (Fields 1995:315). Contemporary

Historic: A Brief History of Freestone
County
The history of Freestone County, and,
specifically, the land that now constitutes
Fairfield Lake State Park, is provided by a report
written by Laurie E. Jasinski (2002) on behalf of
TPWD.
European exploration of the county began
as early as 1542. According to a 1939 study by
the United States De Soto Commission, Luis de
Moscoso Alvarado led an expedition that may
have traversed the county. More definitively, the
1690s was a decade in which trails including the
Upper Presidio Road, which skirted the southern
border of present day Freestone County, were
improved upon and provided a route for Spanish
explorers, militia, government officials, and
clergy to travel between east and south Texas.
In the eighteenth century, Spanish colonists and
French explorers and entrepreneurs, who were
navigating east Texas’ plentiful waterways, took
notice of Native American groups migrating into
the region. Nomadic groups followed bison into
the area while groups of semi-sedentary people
found fertile land and abundant trade with other
indigenous groups and Europeans.
During the transition from the eighteenth
to the nineteenth century, American explorers
from the colonies on the Atlantic coast began
to venture into the region, much to the dismay
of the Spaniards. One notable figure, Phillip
Nolan, traveled through Louisiana and allegedly
produced the first map of Texas; neither he or the
map survived the final journey in 1801 as they
were intercepted by Spanish soldiers. In 1821,
Mexico, which then included the present state of
10

Texas, gained independence from Spain. Unlike
Spain’s miserly views on settlement in the region,
the newly formed Mexican government allowed
individual states to regulate colonization on
their own accord. The State Colonization Law of
March 24, 1825 opened the door for the settlement
of Texas. Subsequently, David G. Burnet of Ohio
secured a contract with the Mexican government
in 1826 to bring 300 families of settlers into
Texas. However, financial misfortunes kept
Burnet from executing his plan, and the rights
to the land were sold to the Galveston Bay and
Texas Land Company in 1830. Also in 1830,
a suspicious Mexican government passed the
Law of April 6th to put an end to the American
colonization and influence of the region. Not
long after American settlement in Texas was
stemmed, the Mexican awarded two statesmen
with significant land grants. Juan Nepomuceno
Acosta, priest and one-time President of the
Senate of the National Congress, and Mariano
Rivas Palacios, who would later become the
governor of the State of Mexico, received adjacent
land grants of 48,712.4 acres each. In 1832, before
the land was officially surveyed and awarded,
Mariano Rivas Palacios turned over his land
grant rights to his grandson, Enrique Antonio
Mexia. The Mexia family, at an unknown date,
either claimed or purchased the Acosta grant and
consequently controlled a sizeable tract of land.
All the while, these bureaucratic exchanges of
land rights did not affect the occupying groups
of Native Americans.

North Carolina was an early settler of Freestone
County, and in 1847, he received a headright that
included land adjacent to Big Brown Creek. It is
possible that his property extended to the present
Post Oak Campsites in the northeast corner of
Fairfield Lake State Park. Headright parcels
adjacent to Edward’s were surveyed and awarded
throughout the 1840s and 1850s, but rights to the
grants were exchanged several times. In some
cases, headrights were forfeited and the title
defaulted to the Mexia family. Shortly after the
annexation of Texas into the United States in
1845, migration to the region increased with a
majority of the population coming from southern
states. Many families who settled the area near
Big Brown Creek came from Wilcox County,
Alabama. In the early days of Fairfield, which
was officially established in 1851 as the county
seat of Freestone, farms fueled the economy
and the Trinity River provided transportation
to market places. Many of the pioneer families
brought their slaves and established farms or
plantations to grow cotton, corn, and tobacco.
In 1851, Benjamin Edwards sold his
headright to Dr. William D. Strain. The
Edwards family moved to what is presently the
southwestern portion of the park, and the Strain
family set up a cotton plantation. Also settled
in the southern end of the present park was the
Chancellor family. In the 1850s, the Chancellors
and their slaves moved to Freestone County from
Wilcox County, Alabama. On the Chancellor’s
parcel, a one-room church and school was built.
An adjacent cemetery, the Chancellor Union
Cemetery, served as the final resting place for
members of the Chancellor family, other related
families, and their slaves. Another prominent
family along Big Brown Creek was the Oliver
Family. William W. Oliver, a wealthy merchant
and landowner in Limestone County, purchased
land from the Mexia family, a 1,100-acre tract that
the Olivers had occupied for half of the previous

Independence from Mexico gained by the
Republic of Texas in 1836 added more to the
confusion over land ownership. In the middle of
the nineteenth century, the area that would later
become Freestone County was largely unsettled.
Surveyors plotted new tracts with no regard to
the previous titles, such as the Mexia family’s
and the Republic of Texas issued headrights to
citizens and immigrants. Benjamin Edwards of

into the Stroud family, one of the largest slave
holding families in Freestone County. Slaves
were figuratively invaluable to the farming
community of Freestone County. In the years
before the Civil War, Freestone County was one
of the leading slave and cotton counties in the
state of Texas, and its economy and population
prospered as a result.

twentieth century, and the Chancellor family
maintained the southern portion of the present
park into the 1900s. The Hill family purchased
the Oliver/Stroud tract in the early 1890s, and
soon became a prominent family in Fairfield. The
Huckaby, McDonald, and Miller families were
also notable newcomers to the land adjacent to
Big Brown Creek. On the Chancellor tract, the
one-room building that was both a church and a
school continued to serve the growing farming
community. Cook’s Ferry Road and a number of
back roads connected the Big Brown Creek area
farming families with each other, Fairfield, and
the Trinity Rivers. Natural gas and oil discoveries
in the region during the early twentieth century
introduced new prosperity to the economy.
While land leasing and prospecting grew rapidly,
farming continued to lead the area’s economy.
However, in the 1920s, farming in Freestone
County went into decline in response to the
Great Depression and the boll weevil infestation.
Small farmers and tenants also felt the strain of
an ever-worsening situation as population size
increased, decreasing the mean farm size, and
soil depletion and erosion affected the quantity
and quality of their cash crops (Bruseth and Moir
1987:22). In order to compensate for the failing
agricultural market, some rural residents turned
to bootlegging liquor in the 1920s. Through
the Prohibition era, Freestone County became
nationally recognized for its quality and quantity
of whiskey, known as Freestone County Bourbon
Deluxe (Leffler 1978). Despite attempts by local
authorities, this illegal industry persisted for
several decades, and constituted a significant if
illicit economic adaptation that allowed many
individuals and families to subsist through an
otherwise dismal period. Since the beginning
of the twentieth century oil discoveries in the
area prompted periods of growth and success for
some landowners (Bruseth and Moir 1987:22).
The oil industries presence can still be felt today
throughout Freestone and surrounding counties

In late 1860, on the verge of the Civil War,
Freestone County voted 585-to-3 in favor of
seceding from the Union. Many prominent
members of the community served in the war,
but of the 1,000 men that left, only 300 survived.
During the war, plantations continued to thrive,
and Freestone County’s prosperity, owed in large
part to free labor, went uninterrupted. The end
of the Civil War and consequent Emancipation
Proclamation marked the beginning of difficult
times for the economy of the county. White
and black families alike struggled with
the economic and social changes. During
Reconstruction, many freed slaves continued
to work land belonging to their former masters
as sharecroppers. Impoverished white families
also found work as sharecroppers and tenant
farmers, and this agricultural practice continued
into the 1960s in Freestone County. In the 1870s
and 1880s, although railroad lines just grazed
the county’s borders to the north and south, the
proximity of the railways to Fairfield allowed the
population and the number of farms to increase
significantly.
Land adjacent to Big Brown Creek, which
would later become Fairfield Lake State Park,
was maintained by many of the families that
had acquired or purchased the land prior to the
Civil War, but a few tracts were often exchanged
between residents of the county. The east side
of the present park was consistently owned by
the Oliver and Stroud families to the turn of the

production began in 1916 to 2004 (Leffler 1978).

have found suitable since the early Holocene.
The county has rich subsurface mineral
resources and an abundance of waterways, and
these natural resources have long been exploited.
In recent history, developmental protocols
requiring cultural resource investigations prior
to construction have added significantly to
the archaeological record of the area. Three
regionally relevant, large scale investigations,
including the Jewett Mine Project, Tennessee
Colony III project, and Richland/Chambers
project, will be discussed briefly. The current
project area, entirely within Fairfield Lake State
Park boundaries, encompasses approximately
35 prehistoric and historic sites. Four of these,
41FT279, 41FT280, 41FT408, and 41FT409,
all historic sites, were discovered during
investigations prior to SFA’s 1996 project. One
site, 41FT630, was recorded by CAS during the
2008 project.

While the Depression forced some of the
Big Brown Creek area families to part with their
land and move on, it provided the opportunity
for other families, the Hill family specifically, to
increase their holdings. In the 1930s and 1940s,
the Hills bought large tracts from the Huckaby
and McDonald families. When land surrounding
Big Brown Creek was bought out by the energy
companies in the 1960s, the Hills owned a
majority of the property that would become the
park. In the 1930s, the one-room church and
school on the Chancellor tract was struck by
lightning and burned down. It was never rebuilt,
and the Chancellors sold their property to the
Bonner family in 1947. The Bonners were an
old and prominent family in the county, at one
time operating one of the largest plantations in
the county and contributing significantly to the
development of the Masonic Lodge and Fairfield
Female College. With the beginning of World War
II and into the 1950’s rural populations began to
decline in a response to the opportunities offered
within large urban centers (Bruseth and Moir
1987:22).

Jewett Mine Project
Jewett Mine is a 35,000-acre mining
complex which supplies two Limestone Electric
Generating Stations in northeast Central Texas
with approximately 7.5 million tons of lignite
per year (Westmoreland Coal Company 2008).
This large operation required that a number of
surveys, testing projects, and mitigations be
performed by several private firms beginning in
1979. Investigations resulted in the discovery of
418 total sites (Fields et al. 1995). Of these 418
sites, 239 contained prehistoric components and
179 contained historic components. A total of
79 sites were tested and 17 sites were mitigated
(Fields et al. 1995).

In the 1950s, what was left of tenant
farms faded into pasture and range for cattle
ranching. Agribusinesses began to move into the
surrounding region and acquire land holdings.
What was once family run plantations soon
became part of an ever-growing business within
the area. The overgrown fields and old roads
also provided recreational areas for descendants
of the families who had settled the region.

This extensive archaeological investigation
reported by Fields et al. (1995) of Prewitt and
Associates Inc., supplied basic knowledge
about the prehistory of the region, which was
previously not well understood. However, gaps
in the project area’s cultural chronology do exist.

Previous Archaeological
Investigations
Freestone County’s proximity to the Trinity
River provides living conditions that humans
13

Occupation predating the Late Archaic period is
not well represented as occupations associated
with the Late Archaic, Woodland, and Late
Prehistoric periods; therefore, little is known
about the Paleoindian and Early to Middle
Archaic inhabitants of the region. Evidence of
the region’s inhabitants during the early Historic
period is not present in the material assemblage
either. Another aspect of the region’s prehistoric
culture that is missing from the material record is
evidence of subsistence practices before the Late
Prehistoric. Unfortunately, the environment does
not support the preservation of organic material.

(Bruseth and Moir 1987). Extensive research
of historic records and historic site mitigations
was also performed during investigations for the
Richland/Chambers Reservoir.

Additional Investigations
In addition to projects described above, which
contributed tremendously to the understanding of
the region’s cultural chronology, archaeological
investigations have been conducted within
the boundaries of the Park prior to the current
project. A review of files from the Texas
Historical Commission’s Texas Archaeological
Site Atlas Database (Database) indicates that
shortly after acquiring Park land by lease in 1971,
TPWD conducted an internal Park Management
Inventory of cultural resources. In 1972 George
Kegley discovered sites 41FT279 and 41FT280,
which were revisited by Ron Ralph in 1983;
however, it appears that the only records of these
sites appear on the Database in 1992, courtesy
of Dan Crouch. Sites 41FT408 and 41FT409
were also discovered as a part of an internal
management inventory, and although their
dates of discovery are unclear, these sites were
recorded on the Database in 1997 by Ron Ralph.
Following initial Park Management Inventories,
several small-scale investigations took place in
order to secure project area clearances (d’Aigle
2006; Price 1983; Skinner 1983; Tiemann 2003,
2004). These small scale investigations were
commonly performed prior to well or pipeline
construction and not one of them identified
cultural deposits within their respective project
areas. In 1996, Stephen F. Austin State University
(SFA) conducted a field school survey of the Park
under the direction of Dr. James E. Corbin under
contract with TPWD. This survey recorded and
documented 30 new sites in addition to the four
previously recorded sites, but due to unforeseen
circumstances, the results of the survey and
curation of the recovered artifacts were not
completed. In 2008, CAS was contracted by

Tennessee Colony III and Richland/
Chambers Projects
In the mid- to late-1970s, archaeological
investigations were conducted prior to the
construction of a dam that would create a large
reservoir in the northern portion of Freestone
County. Initially, the reservoir was going to
be called Tennessee Colony Lake. Southern
Methodist University’s (SMU) Archaeology
Research Program, on behalf of the Army Corps
of Engineers, performed three surveys in the area
that would potentially be affected by Tennessee
Colony Lake; 311 prehistoric and historic sites
were discovered (Richner 1982). Many of these
sites, at the time, contained cultural material worth
mitigating. Partly as a result of these finds, plans
for Tennessee Colony Lake were abandoned for
the Richland/Chambers reservoir. The Richland/
Chambers Reservoir was a fraction of Tennessee
Colony Lake’s size. The project area was also
investigated by SMU’s Archaeology Research
Program. During investigations, a total of 53
prehistoric and historic sites were mitigated.
Results of mitigations from prehistoric sites
revealed trends similar to those of the Jewett
Mine project; evidence of Paleoindian and Early
to Middle Archaic occupations was minimal and
evidence of economic/subsistence practices before
the Late Prehistoric period was not preserved

TPWD to re-evaluate the recorded sites at the
park based on their perceived NRHP potential
and degree to which they were intact, and also
to complete the documentation and curation that
SFA had begun (Yelacic et al. 2008). The product
of CAS’s work in 2008 was intended to provide
TPWD with a priority schema for managing
sites in cases where impacts are foreseen from
Park development and construction. A final site,
41FT630, was also recorded at this time.

Project Goals and Methodology
by Julian A. Sitters

Project Goals

Archival Methods

The initial objectives of this project were to
conduct an intensive archaeological survey for the
park to ensure that all areas have been inspected
for archaeological deposits, and also to conduct
archival research sufficient for determining what
can be known about the abandoned historic
cemetery, 41FT630. CAS’s efforts focused
primarily on five distinct activities: (1) a review
of existing county records that document the
location(s) and name(s) of plotted cemeteries in
Freestone County, as well as Freestone County
marriage records in order to begin developing
information about the identity of the woman,
Ester Miles, whose headstone marks the
cemetery location; (2) a review of historical maps
and documents that might show the location(s)
of historic buildings, homes, roads, and property
lines, as these represent possible site locations;
(3) pedestrian survey of the park boundaries
excluding previously-recorded sites, waterways,
and steeply sloping terrain; (4) shovel testing
of probable areas for the presence of buried
archaeological deposits; and (5) documenting
contemporary features such as roads, pipelines,
park dumpsites, and so forth that are present
across the site and that obscure or obliterate any
potential archaeological deposits that may have
been in those areas.

Archival records, including historic maps
and marriage records, were reviewed prior to the
pedestrian survey. Historic maps were evaluated
in an effort to identify potential sites based on
illustrated historic property lines, structures,
and roads. Historic maps of Freestone County
were accessed at the Dolph Briscoe Center for
American History at The University of Texas at
Austin and at the Freestone County Museum. Four
maps, a Freestone County Starr Plat Map dating
to the early half of the twentieth century, a 1922
United States Army Corps of Engineer Historic
Topographic Map, a 1905 working sketch of
Freestone County, and a 1948 General Highway
Map of Freestone County, were reviewed. None
of these maps depicted any standing structures
in the project area, or provided any information
regarding potential sites within the project area.
Other historic records that were consulted
included the Freestone County marriage records
for 1860s (1853-1883 Colored Marriage Records,
Vol. 1-2:101). The lone grave marker present at the
abandoned cemetery site 41FT630 names a woman
named Easter Miles. Information pertaining to
Easter Miles was assessed in order to identify
the woman and to identify, if possible, the name
of the cemetery where she had been interred. The
only available information for Easter Miles came
from the African American marriage records at
the Freestone County Clerk’s Office, located in
the town of Fairfield. Easter Miles’s marriage
records showed her maiden name to be Strain
17

and that she had married Robert Miles on the
22nd of February, 1868. Other than the marriage
record no other information was found pertaining
to her, and no named cemetery was identified
where she was buried. Next, the Freestone
County Clerk’s Office was contacted and asked
about platted cemeteries that were located in the
park boundaries. The Office was unaware of any
unmarked cemetery located within the Park, and
knew only of the Chancellors Union Cemetery.
CAS researchers also checked available maps
showing platted cemeteries, and likewise could
find no indication that 41FT630 has ever been
platted. No other information pertaining to the
unmarked cemetery was located.

well as areas deemed potentially suitable for
structures and human occupation. Once each
smaller section of the park had been covered in
this fashion, CAS archaeologists returned to the
areas marked with flagging tape to shovel test
and inspect these areas more closely. Multiple
shovel tests were excavated in these places to
ensure that no additional remains were present at
or just below the surface. Elsewhere, at least one
shovel test was excavated for every 3 acres in
accordance with minimal survey standards for
project areas of this size that have been proposed
by the Council of Texas Archeologists and
adopted by the Texas Historical Commission.
CAS archaeologists did not shovel test park areas
that are consistently inundated, rest on a steep
incline, or have been heavily impacted by park
construction such as campsites or roads. Shovel
tests measured 30 cm in diameter, and were
excavated in 20-cm levels to sterile subsoil or
a depth of approximately 100 cm below surface
(cmbs). All sediments were screened through
¼-inch wire mesh, and all shovel test pits were
backfilled after completion. A total of 215 shovel
tests were excavated over the course of the field
work.

Considering the date for Easter’s marriage
to Robert Miles, and that her maiden name was
Strain, CAS suggests there a strong likelihood
that Easter was one of the slaves owned by
Dr. William Strain, who acquired property
from Benjamin Edwards and operated a cotton
plantation, as described in Chapter 2. This site
is located in the same part of the park where
Dr. Strain’s property is believed to have been
located, and it was a common practice for slaves
to take their owner’s last name.

Field Methods

Field Documentation and Artifact
Collection

After reviewing historical maps and
documents, CAS archaeologists arrived at
Fairfield Lake State Park in April of 2009 and
began to familiarize themselves with the park.
Using landscape features such as roads and
creek beds, the region was broken into different
sections for survey. Using smaller sections of
acreage, the CAS crew was able to maintain
greater accuracy in plotting locations of shovel
tests and any items that were encountered or
documented. Flagging tape was used to mark
areas that contained isolated occurrences, such
as glass bottles, cans, buckets, and so on, as

Shovel test forms were filled out for every
excavated shovel test. Recorded information
included the location of the shovel test based
on proximity to park roads, the lake line, park
buildings, and/or park trails. Vegetation in
the vicinity of the shovel test was recorded,
including the presence of trees, grasses, shrubs,
and vines. Surface features were also recorded
including geomorphological deposits such as
surface gravel or exposed clay, the relative
surface incline, as well as ground visibility.
Other surface features include possible historic
roads, agricultural fields, and wells. Using a
18

Munsell chart, sediments were described based
on their color and composition. The presence
of gravel, water, roots, animal burrows, and
compactness were described. Lastly, cultural
debris and possible artifacts encountered during
the excavation of a shovel test were noted. In the
case of a possible site, maps were drawn and site
boundaries were defined by excavating multiple
shovel tests around the area of interest.

with these items. Many such objects represent
historic-period occupation in the park.

Laboratory Methods and Curation
Cultural materials collected from the Park
were transported to CAS in San Marcos, Texas
for processing and inventory in accordance
with the TPWD Archeology Lab Manual.
These materials consisted of a variety of bottles
collected from the park. Once at the lab, they
were washed, photographed, identified/dated,
and added to the photographic record.

Digital photography was used to document
the excavated shovel tests. A minimum of one
general overview shot of each shovel test was
taken to illustrate the natural environment, as
well as one shot depicting the shovel test itself.
When appropriate, additional photographs
were taken of surface features, such as possible
agricultural fields and historic roads.

Photographs were compiled and organized
in the lab. Each photo was given a identifying
number in a sequence of all photos taken during
this project, individually labeled and printed
on acid free paper. A photo log was created
that includes information on photo description,
direction, location, date, and photographer. The
photos and photo log were then enclosed in
plastic protector sheets and compiled into two
binders.

Collected artifacts include complete bottles
that display a maker’s mark. Other artifacts,
such as metal fragments, barbed wire fences,
and bricks were photographed, described, and
their location plotted. A final aspect of field
documentation involved photographing items
that had been confiscated by park personnel
from park-goers trying to leave the premises

All field records, artifacts, maps, photographs
(digital and hardcopy), and photographic logs
were submitted to TPWD along with copies of
this final report on acid-free paper.

ideal areas have been disturbed
by pipelines, roads, public use

remaining portions are bisected by
drainage systems and are sloping
towards the lake. The flora consists
mainly of short grasses and mixed
hardwoods (Figure 4-8). The depth
of clay varies from 100 cmbs to
right at the surface (Figure 4-9). A
number of previously recorded sites
are found in this area.

barbs. This style of barbed wire was patented
in 1883 by George C Baker (Hagemejer 2001).
This barbed wire form remained constant from
1883 to the present. It is still in production today
making it difficult to date the barbed wire found
within the park boundaries. The only distinction
that can be made between the isolated barbed
wire fragments is the method by which it was
fastened to vertical posts. In some instances, the
barbed wire was attached to a tree, and over time
trees have grown over the barbed
wire encasing it. The other method
involved the barbed wire being
attached to wooden posts using a
U-shaped staple (Figure 4-10). The
barbed wire represents fragments
of old property lines, more than
likely those which stood during the
leasing of the property by TPWD in
1971.

also present. In most cases where
glass bottles were found modern
trash was also present. Modern
trash included beer cans, soda
bottles, motor boat oil containers,
and park debris, including wooden
beams and concrete pipes (Figure
4-11). It was not uncommon to
find glass bottles and fragments
alongside modern day refuse in
areas where inundation frequently
occurs or in areas where park debris
was systematically dumped. Glass
bottles typically included CocaCola, Dr. Pepper, and Pearl bottles
common to the 1960s-1970s.

Other artifacts discovered within the park
boundaries include metal refuse. This typically
includes deteriorating metal buckets and cans.
Other metal artifacts include those found by
park visitors (Figure 4-12). These artifacts are
now stored at the park maintenance barn after
they were confiscated by park staff. The original
location of these artifacts is unknown.

Another common artifact at the
park includes glass bottles. When

seen at Fairfield Lake State Park
includes pottery sherds and bricks.
The pottery sherds identified were
all located along roads and on top of
pipelines, near an identified site in
areas previously disturbed by park
construction. Brick refuse was also
present within the park boundaries.
In all cases, the bricks appeared to
be out of context. They appeared

Shovel Tests No. 35 and 38

Shovel tests No. 35 and 38 were excavated
in response to three glass bottles located on
the surface. The glass bottles were located
behind the park’s maintenance barn off an old
historic wagon trail (Figure 4-14). The terrain
is relatively flat, inclining slightly to the north.
Mixed hardwoods, shrubs, and short to tall
grasses are present in this area. The three glass
bottles were found together along with a rubber
shoe sole (Figure 4-15). Two of the three bottles
were able to be dated based on their makers
mark. A specific date could not be obtained for
either bottle, but the date of manufacture ranges
from 1911-1953 or later (Toulouse 1971). Shovel
tests No. 35 and No. 38 yielded no additional
artifacts.

Shovel Test No. 42
Shovel test No. 42 is located to the
south of the intersection of Little Brown
Creek and the Park Road. The terrain
slopes west towards the park road and is
composed of mixed hardwoods, shrubs,
and short grasses. An iron ore sphere
was located at 15 cbms (Figure 4-16).
This object is a natural concretion that
is in the shape of a sphere and may be
commonly mistaken as a marble. The

mixed hardwoods and tall grasses. The shovel
test produced negative results.

Shovel Test No. 196
Shovel test No. 196 is located in the
northwestern portion of the park in between
two creek beds that run east to west. The park
boundary and a pipeline are located 50 feet
uphill from the shovel test. Terrain slopes from
west to east and contains mixed hardwoods.
The shovel test was excavated in response to a
fractured quartz nodule that could have been a
prehistoric artifact located on the surface (Figure
4-20). A thorough surface survey was made of
this locale before the shovel test was excavated.
The surface survey and the shovel test produced
negative results with the presence of clay at the
surface (Figure 4-21). The quartz nodule showed

(Figure 4-19). The terrain consists of tall grasses
and mixed hardwoods. The shovel test produced
negative results and no artifacts were found in

Shovel Test No. 204

Shovel Test No. 211 and 215

Shovel test No. 204 was excavated due to the
presence of two metal buckets along a barbed
wire fence in the northwestern portion of the park
(Figure 4-22). The shovel test is located uphill
from the lake and the terrain consists of mixed
hardwoods, short grasses, and shrubs. The
shovel test produced negative results, reaching
clay at 10 cmbs (Figure 4-23). The shovel test and
metal buckets are located 68 meters downhill
on a gradual incline from site 41FT470, which

Shovel tests No. 22, 211, and 215 were
excavated due to the presence of park debris.
The debris and shovel tests are located to the
southeast of the park road. A small drainage
system runs north to south approximately seven
meters to the northeast of the park debris. The
terrain consists of mixed hardwoods and short
grasses. The modern park debris consisted of
glass bottles, wooden beams, concrete cylinders,

and metal fragments (Figure 4-24). The shovel
tests produced negative results and after a brief
analysis of the debris it was concluded that the
artifacts were modern and associated with park
construction clean-up.

Shovel Tests No. 31 and 36
Shovel tests No. 31 and 36 were excavated in
response to what appears to be a large abandoned
agricultural field (Figure 4-25). The agricultural
field is located about 400 meters to the east of park
headquarters and is north of the park road. Little
Brown Creek runs along the eastern boundary
of the agricultural fields. To the northeast of the
agricultural field a low lying area exists, which
appears to be frequently inundated (Figure 4-26).
Both shovel tests and a visual survey of the area
produced negative results.

The barbed wire was bound together with
modern wire ties and the low frequency of bricks
suggests that the artifacts present were removed
from their original context and dumped at this
location.

Conclusions and R ecommendations
by Jon C. Lohse, Julian A. Sitters, and David M. Yelacic
are considered eligible for listing to the NRHP
and/or being designated as SALs and should
be avoided to the degree possible or feasible
in the context of the proposed development. If
these sites cannot be avoided, CAS recommends
that TPWD conduct additional archaeological
investigations and, in the case of historic sites,
archival research to mitigate the loss of important
cultural information that these sites contain. In
the event that Level 2 sites cannot be avoided and
will be impacted by future developments, CAS
recommends that TPWD conduct additional
archaeological and/or archival research to
finalize assessments about the potential
significance of these sites. This research should
focus on assessing whether these sites meet any
of the significance or worthiness criteria set forth
in the NHPA or the Texas Antiquities Code.
Based on the results of this work, additional
research may or may not be warranted. Level
3 sites are considered to have very little to no
research potential, but are of unknown eligibility
for designation as SALs or nomination to the
NRHP. The THC should review these sites in
the event of future impacts. Level 4 sites are not
considered eligible for listing to the NRHP or
worthy of being designated as SALs. If future
developments are proposed that will impact
Level 4 sites, CAS recommends that TPWD be
granted regulatory clearance to proceed with
those activities without further consideration for
any potential loss of information that may result
from that development.

This project was conducted in order to provide
a complete, systematic archaeological survey of
the Fairfield Lake State Park. Previous survey
projects (Yelacic et al. 2008) visited a total of 35
sites, 34 of which had been previously recorded,
representing historic and prehistoric occupation.
However, it remained uncertain that previous
projects had covered the entire park area, or had
only visited locales identified as high probability
areas. The current effort was preceded by an
archival search for historic buildings, and files
in the Freestone County Clerk’s Office were
checked to determine whether the abandoned
cemetery, 41FT630, had ever been platted.
Following the review of historical sources, field
work consisting of pedestrian survey and shovel
testing of the entire park, excluding recorded
sites and highly disturbed areas, was conducted.
Two hundred fifteen shovel tests were excavated
during this project. No new sites were located,
and all cultural materials that were observed
during the survey are believed to reflect modern
and recent usage of the park.
Based on the results of this project, CAS
recommends that TPWD consider the list of
sites presented in Yelacic et al. (2008) to be
complete. Detailed recommendations regarding
each site’s eligibility for listing to the NRHP and
worthiness for designation as a SAL presented
in that report should be followed in the event
of future developments and impacts. For
convenience, the list of recorded sites and their
assigned management priority is appended to
this report in Appendix B. Briefly, Level 1 sites

Regarding the abandoned cemetery, site
41FT630, CAS was unable to find any evidence
that it has ever been legally platted at the Freestone
County Clerk’s Office. Abandoned cemeteries in
Texas are described and regulated in Chapter
711, Sections 711.010 and 711.011 of the State of
Texas Health and Safety Code. Section 711.011 (a)
states that “a person who discovers an unknown
or abandoned cemetery shall file notice of the
cemetery with the county clerk of the county
in which the cemetery is located. The notice
must contain a legal description of the land on
which the unknown or abandoned cemetery was
found and describe the approximate location of
the cemetery and the evidence of the cemetery
that was discovered” (emphasis added). CAS
interprets the term “shall” to mean that filing of
these cemeteries is required under State law.

graves. Systematic shovel testing will allow for
greater control over the depth of the excavation
and the amount of surface area disturbed when
compared to mechanical ground scraping.
Upon the discovery of coffin furniture, human
remains, and other related funerary objects, it is
recommended that vertical excavation will cease
and horizontal excavations will begin to confirm
the presence of a grave. CAS recommends that
more intrusive techniques such as mechanical
ground scraping be considered inappropriate
to the current use of this area as a recreational
State Park. These activities are also liable to
bring additional unwanted attention to the
cemetery area, which is currently unfenced and
unmarked.
Limited available archival and historical
information about the cemetery’s sole named
interment, Mrs. Easter Miles, indicates that both
she and her husband, Mr. Bob Miles, were of
African American descent. Marriage records
reveal that they were wed in 1868, not long
after post-bellum emancipation. Mrs. Miles’s
maiden name, Strain, is the same as one of the
region’s early prominent families, and it is very
likely that she was a former slave who took or
was given her owner’s name. Together, this
information makes it highly probable that the
cemetery’s other occupants are also of African
American descent, and may have been slaves,
freed slaves, or first generation descendants of
freed slaves when they died. CAS accordingly
recommends that an additional component of
this effort include a series of oral interviews for
the purpose of compiling a historical narrative
about the descendant community, including
many slaves and former slaves, who occupied
this area and who may be interred in or were
associated with this cemetery. These interviews
should focus not only on descendant community
members in Fairfield area, but also on prominent
Anglo families who may be descended from

Based on the negative finds of CAS’s
investigations of current records at the Freestone
County Clerk’s office, CAS recommends that
site 41FT630 be legally surveyed and reported
to the Freestone County Clerk’s office in
Fairfield. At present, the precise boundaries of
this cemetery are uncertain; some depressions
are evident in a loose cluster near the single
headstone, but at least one isolated depression is
also visible on the opposite side of the park road
that bisects the cemetery (see site description
in Yelacic et al. 2008:72-74). Accordingly,
before the legal description of the cemetery is
filed, CAS recommends that TPWD conduct
archaeological survey of this site in order to
search for additional unmarked graves. This
work should employ multiple techniques to
search for unmarked burials, including but not
specifically limited to non-intrusive techniques
such as Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey
with a magnetometer or, minimally, hand-held
magnetic detector. Additional efforts should
include systematic shovel testing throughout
the area thought to possibly contain unmarked

documents pertaining to the time period in
