Archeological Investigations at the Little Campus
Restoration Project, Austin, Texas

ABSTRACT
The oldest building of the former Texas State Asylum for the Blind in
Austin, built in 1858 and 1859, was investigated archeologically in 1982.
The building was briefly home and headquarters to General George Arm­
strong Custer, who in 1865 was commander of federal occupation troops in
Texas.
Mrs. Custer's written account of her life in Austin is examined together
with other nineteenth century documentation of the site.
Artifacts deposited from 1859 to 1872 in a kitchen area are described
and offered for comparison with artifacts from other Civil War and Recon­
struction sites of this type.
The photographic mapping of the original (1859) kitchen floor, the
sampling by excavation of a large nineteenth century cistern, and other as­
pects of the investigation are described.

INTRODUCTION
This paper presents results of an archeological investigation at the Little
Campus, 41TV611, part of The University of Texas at Austin. The investigation
was unusual because the excavation took place inside a well-dated standing his­
toric structure that was at the time undergoing restoration.
The Little Campus, a collection of buildings that were the original home of
the Texas State Asylum for the Blind, has been part of the main campus of The
University of Texas at Austin since the 1920s. The complex was placed on the
National Register of Historic Places in August 1974 and was designated a State
Archeological Landmark in May 1981. The oldest building in the complex has
often been referred to as the Custer House. This two-story limestone masonry
structure with brick trim was erected in 1858 and 1859 (Tillotson 1977: 18) by
Abner Cook, the master builder who built the Governor's Mansion, the John Han­
cock house, and the Neill-Cochran house, all National Register properties in
Austin. Built to house the Texas State Asylum for the Blind, it did so for 60
years. Although it was only briefly, during the winter of 1865, home and head­
quarters to General George Armstrong Custer, commander of the federal oc­
cupation troops in Austin, this is the era that has surrounded the building with
popular lore.

Construction of the Custer House was begun in the spring or early summer
of 1858 and completed in March 1859 (Trustees Report, 1860, quoted in Tillot­
son 1977: 18). The Board of Trustees closed the school in the summer of 1862
because of the distressed financial condition of the Confederate States, but was
overruled by Governor Lubbock, who ordered it reopened. At this time (during

14

the Civil War) there were ten students. In March 1864 the trustees "directed that
tallow, wieting and moulds should be purchased so that candles could be made at
the institution, for none could be purchased in the Confederate States." Exigen­
cies of the war finally closed the school on January 7, 1865, when the Board
declared that "owing to the worthlessness of Treasury warrants the wants of the
pupils can not be supplied" (Tillotson 1977: 18).
The building remained vacant until November 4, 1865, when General
Custer arrived in Austin. He brought not only 4000 federal troops, but also his
father, brother Tom, and wife Elizabeth Bacon Custer (Figure I), who has left us
an account of their arrival.
Before we reached Austin, several citizens sent out invitations for us to come to their
houses; but I knew the General would not accept, and, cold as the nights were, I felt
unwilling to lose a day of camp life. We pitched our tents on rolling ground in the
vicinity of Austin, where we overlooked a pretty town of stuccoed houses that ap­
peared summery in the midst of live-oak's perennial green. The State House, Land
Office, and Governor's Mansion looked regal to us, so long bivouacking in the forest
and on uncultivated prairies. The Governor offered for our headquarters the Blind
Asylum, which had been closed during the war. This possessed one advantage that
we were glad to improve; there was room enough for all the staff, and a long saloon
parlor and dining-room for our hops during the winter.
There were three windows in our room, which we opened at night; but, not­
withstanding the air that circulated. the feeling, after having been so long out of
doors, was suffocating. The ceiling seemed descending to smother us. There was
one joy: reveille could ring out on the dawning day, and there was no longer imper­
ative necessity to spring from a warm bed and make ablutions in ice-water. There
is a good deal of that sort of mental snapping of the fingers on the part of campaign­
ers when they are again stationary, and need not prepare for a march. Civilization
and a looking-glass must now be assumed, as it would no longer do to rough it and
ignore appearances, after we had moved into a house, and were to live like "folks."
Besides, we soon began to be invited by the townspeople to visit them [Custer
1971 :216-217].

Custer lived in the building for only a brief time; he left Austin on February
4, 1866, barely three months after he arrived. The letters and later writings of
Elizabeth Custer left a lively record of their stay.
After the war, efforts to reopen the Blind Asylum were initiated by Gover­
nor J. W. Throckmorton, who appointed a new board in August 1866. The new
Board, "finding the Legislature disinclined to do anything for the institution, re­
solved to resign" (Trustees Report 1869, quoted by Tillotson 1977: 29). The in­
stitution was reopened during the winter of 1866 and had 15 students by the fol­
lowing spring. The succession of boards and staffs dismissed and appointed
during the Reconstruction years are detailed by Tillotson (1977 : 31- 35). During
these turbulent years the building remained largely as it was before the war, and
although some frame buildings were added to those already on the grounds, no
significant remodeling of the main building occurred until 1872.

crosshatched is the part of the building that has been restored and now known as the Arno
Nowotny Building. See Figure 3. After Tillotson (1977, plate 30).

In the summer of 1872 the first of many modifications to Abner Cook's
original building was undertaken, at least partially under his direction (Cook was
then a member of the Board of Trustees). Two wings, each 24 by 60 feet and two
stories high, were planned, but construction was delayed until the arrival of the
railroad in Austin, which was expected to lower significantly the cost of lumber
and other materials. When the expansion was undertaken, a large, two-story
wing was added to the north side (Figure 2); classrooms on the first floor and
five girls' dormitory rooms on the second all opened onto a west-facing gallery
(Trustees' Report, 1872).

The site plan (Figure 2) shows that the new north wing covered most of the
areaway that let light into the kitchen area and probably blocked the flue that
served the kitchen fireplace on the north wall and the first-floor fireplace just
above it. We cannot be certain that the addition of this wing rendered the kitchen
obsolete, but it certainly made it a dark and airless place after 1872. Archeological
data on this addition were destroyed when the wing was demolished in the 1880s
to make way for more elaborate improvements.
The 1880 project, completed in October 1881 (Tillotson 1977: 53), affected
the entire main building and greatly changed its exterior appearance. The origi­

nal roof and cupola were removed, and a brick third Hoor was added. The east
and west wings were extended (Figures 3 and 4) and given second floors; the
north wing was razed and replaced with a larger structure.
Building continued at the site to provide for an ever-expanding student body.
Whole complexes of classrooms, dormitories, and other facilities were built, and
by the early part of the twentieth century the site had become a warren of court­
yards, hallways, and connected buildings. Although they now appear to be a
single structure, three of the high Victorian brick buildings that have been pre­
served and restored on the site-known for many years as Building H, now
the Employment Center of the University of Texas-were built in 1888, 1891,
and 1900.
When World War I began, the institution, which had been renamed in 1905
the Blind Institute and in 1915 the Blind School, had begun to move its operation
from this site to its present location, a new and larger campus on 45th Street. The
move was hastened when the original buildings of the Blind School were given to
the newly founded School of Military Aviation (SMA) at The University of Texas
in July 1917. Wholesale remodeling was undertaken to adapt the buildings to
wartime military usage. The Trustees of the School complained that the orderly
move to their new campus was hampered by the SMA's "tearing the buildings
apart" (fiHotson 1977: 171). During this era alphabetical designations were
given to the buildings: the old main building became Building C, and the com­
bination of three Victorian buildings became Building H. These designations
persisted until the University Board of Regents in 1982 renamed Building C the
Arno Nowotny Building.
After World War I, the buildings remained officially under control of the
University, although their use between February 1919 and October 1922 is unclear
(Tillotson 1977: 189). In 1922 the legislature transferred the buildings to the
State Lunatic Asylum as an annex called the Institution for the Senile for housing
senile persons who had become wards of the State. This usage was almost as
short lived as was the use of the site by the Central Texas State Fair, held there
in 1922.
Several legal actions concerning the buildings were brought against the
State Board of Control, and on July 1, 1925 the Institution for the Senile was
finally closed, and all patients were transferred to the State Hospital in Wichita
Falls. In anticipation of this move, the legislature in March 1925 had transferred
all the buildings to The University of Texas, where they became known as the
Little Campus. After some renovation, the Little Campus became a men's dor­
mitory. Occupancy of the buildings has changed several times since 1925, but
ownership has remained with the University.
Since restoration was completed, the Arno Nowotny Building (Building C)
(Figure 5) has housed the University Visitors' Center, and Building H, the Uni­
versity admissions and employment offices. The exteriors of both buildings have
been restored as nearly as possible to their original (1888-1900) appearance
(Figure 6). The interiors have been modified to accommodate modern heating

and cooling equipment as well as safety and fire-protection features not required
when the buildings were erected. The interior of the Arno Nowotny Building has
been restored to conform to the historic period compatible with its exterior
design.

RESEARCH DESIGN
One of the conditions of the Antiquities Permit for restoration of the No­
wotny Building virtually dictated the role of the archeologist in the project. re­
quiring that "demolition should be monitored by the architect and a qualified
historic archeologist. If historic fabric is uncovered then appropriate steps should
be taken to investigate, incorporate, record, or protect as required."
Tillotson's (1977) excellent history of the site, the architect's plans, and the
files of the Texas Antiquities Committee were studied to identify problems and
areas of good archeological potential. Three questions were posed to be an­
swered by excavation: (I) what was the size of the original east and west wings of
the Nowotny Building, (2) could intact nineteenth-century cisterns be found, and

(3) what could be discovered about a basement kitchen that had been located
under the north side of the main block of the Nowotny Building (Figures 2, 3C).
PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS
Excavation began at the Nowotny Building during the University's 1982
Christmas break, to avoid interference with the restoration work. The first project
was to uncover whatever remnants could be found of the foundations for the east
wing of the building, in order to determine its original (1859) size, for the origi­
nal wings has been extensively expanded and remodeled in 1880 (Figure 5). The
renovation architect's estimates of the size of the original wings were derived en­
tirely from drawings and photographs.
Ea.~t

Wing
It took almost a week to clear and map the foundations, which were for­
tunately found intact. First, we explored with a steel-rod probe to find the outline
of the foundation, in order to determine what areas should be cleared of soil and
building debris. Then we removed the hard-packed clay from the remains of the
walls with picks, shovels. and trowels. No power equipment was used. Once
cleared, the courses of masonry that were uncovered were swept clean to facili­
tate accurate mapping and photographing (Figure 7). Much to the relief of all
concerned, the foundations we uncovered proved the architect's estimates to
be correct.
Cistern
Our second objective was to sample the contents of a large cistern that had
been fortuitously uncovered when its concrete cover was dislodged during the
clearing of demolition debris. The cistern was 17 feet deep and 10 feet in diame­
ter, with a capacity of about I rt.Rf cubic feet when filled to the 14-foot level.
Location of the cistern 20 feet north of the original west wing of the building
suggests that it was part of the original site rather than a later addition.
We sampled the contents of the cistern by quartering the deposit as if it were
a pie and excavating the southwest quadrant, waterscreening the soil through
quarter-inch mesh. Though we hoped for a significant artifact deposit, the result
was disappointing. The complete inventory of artifacts from the cistern follows:
iron sash pulley
5 badly rusted nails
1 two-piece sash pulley cover
I rodent skull
I fragment of ornamental iron I black-on-gray historic ceramic sherd
23 clear glass window sherds
to white ironstone ceramic sherds
brown/amber bottle sherd
1 fragment of white plastic
1978-D U.S. copper penny

The plastic and the 1978 penny immediately destroyed our hope for an un­
disturbed nineteenth century deposit. After consultation with members of the

THE KITCHEN

Testing
When the kitchen wall at the west end of the central part of th~ Nowotny
Building was opened during demolition of the old added-on west wing (Figure
2), we gained access to the presumed basement kitchen and found the space par­
tially filled with dirt and cultural debris.
A l-by-I-meter test pit was dug in the northwest corner of the area to deter­
mine the depth and nature of the cultural fill. That and other test pits showed that
the upper part of this fill contained caliche and ash, mixed throughout with mainly
post-1920 building debris: fragments of electrical wire, discarded plumbing
scraps and fixtures, nails, etc., but a sherd of a stoneware wine bottle led us to be­
lieve that at least the lower part of the fill had been in place since the late nine­
teenth century. At a depth of 7 feet 8 inches below the joists supporting the first
floor we encountered what appeared to be an intact flagstone floor.

12

Preparation for Digging
Several delays prevented an early start on excavating the kitchen: the forest
of piping and wiring had to be removed, but the structural engineer did not wish
the fill removed until certain deteriorated sections of the below-grade stone foun­
dation wall had been repaired. It was also desirable that we wait until the building
contractor had excavated the areaway on the north side of the kitchen so we could
open the original windows into the kitchen to allow both daylight to work by and
access for our equipment.
The kitchen was 12 feet wide and slightly more than 44 feet long, and the fill
varied in depth from 2 to 3 feet. Therefore, since the upper part of the fill con­
tained mainly post-1920 building debris, we chose, with the concurrence of the
Antiquities Committee staff, to remove the overburden with a small front-end
loader. Only the final 6 inches of the fill covering the flagstone floor would be
excavated by hand.

Surface Collecting
Some artifacts had been noted on the surface in a low crawl space that bor­
dered the kitchen on the south. Two original access vents, each about 25 inches
square, led from the kitchen into this area. Because of plans for duct work and
other utilities, this space was to be excavated by the building contractor to a
depth of 4 feet below the supporting timbers.
Before the construction workers started excavating this area, we collected
all of the cultural material that lay on the surface. This crawl space evidently had
been a favored place for disposal of broken dishes, bottles, and glassware.
Sherds of white ironstone serving pieces had been thrown into the area from the
kitchen, and a quantity of bones suggested that pets had been fed kitchen scraps
and leftover meat here.

Excavation
Once the construction workers started to dig, they were asked to save all
artifacts for the archeologists. Daily monitoring visits were made, and an arche­
ologist screened every tenth wheelbarrow load of soil removed from the space.
The fairly low rate of recovery from these sample loads suggested that the con­
struction workers were indeed spotting most ofthe material and saving it for us.
We began the hand excavation of the final 6 inches of fill from the kitchen
area along the west wall and worked toward the east. We did not use grid units
because the artifacts could be plotted exactly from their locations relative to the
walls. After the floor was exposed, a grid system of 2-foot intervals was laid out
for use in photographic recording.
As we began uncovering the flagstone floor, the material turning up on our
screen suggested that the room had not been a kitchen when the first layer of fill
was deposited on the flagstones. Bits of anthracite coal, cinders, and badly rusted
pipes and fittings of the type once used in steam heating systems began to appear.
Most of these lay on or in a i -inch layer of white caliche that covered the flagstones;
the fill above the caliche was darker soil containing more debris and some ash.

of Feature I; c, the sealing layer of clean white caliche; d-d' , the brick and coal-slag debris

Twelve feet from the west end of the kitchen we encountered a break in the
flagstone pavement and a distinct line of brick masonry, which we designated
Feature 1 (Figure 8). Investigation of his feature revealed the foundation of a
large, about 8-by-1O-foot coal-fired boiler. Feature 1 was about 1 foot below the
level of the flagstone floor, and the sides had been lined with brick. A section of
the flagstone floor about 12 feet square had been removed to permit the installa­
tion of the boiler in this centrally located pit dug into the undisturbed caliche
beneath the site. The fill of Feature 1 was rich in coal, slag, lumps of cinders, and
fire-blackened bricks. Here too we encountered many iron pipe fittings.
Oddly, the plaster on the walls below the fill line was quite well preserved,
but no plaster remained on the exposed walls; even the limestone blocks were
badly eroded by spalling above the upper surface of the fill.

Stratigraphy
The dark soil of the rather uniform overburden in the kitchen gave way to
the distinct layer of white caliche that lay on the flagstones (Figure 8). Below the
flagstone floor was the dark fill with burned brick of Feature I, which was exca­
vated into bedrock caliche.

Texas Archeological Society
Chronological Interpretation

We know from Mrs. Custer's account (1971 ; 230) that the kitchen was func­
tioning as such in 1865 and that the building was still heated by wood-burning
fireplaces at that time (1971 :238-239). We also know that after the central
boiler plant for the Asylum was completed in 1888, the separate furnace (Feature
1) would have been unnecessary. So the room ceased to be used as a kitchen at
some time during the 23 years between 1865 and 1888, when the separate fur­
nace was installed.
Because we found anthracite coal in Feature 1, we can infer that the furnace
was designed to use this fuel and that it was installed after 1872 when the railroad
came to Austin. (Hauling hard coal by ox wagon would not have been economic.)
The records show that a planned expansion of the building was delayed for two
years in anticipation of a fall in lumber prices expected when the railroad arrived
(Tillotson 1977: 35). This expansion, which was the two-story stone wing built
in 1872 onto the north side of the central part of the building (Figure 2), blocked
the areaway that let light and air into the kitchen.
It seems apparent from these facts that the kitchen was not used as such after
the summer of 1872, and that the flagstone floor was pierced at about that time
for installation of the furnace. It should be noted that subsequent construction
projects further damaged the floor, but when it was fully exposed, more than 50
percent was intact.

A Preservation Problem
Although a substantial part of the original kitchen floor was intact, plans for
the restoration called for a concrete floor with drains and supports for heavy air
conditioning equipment at a level 6 inches below the flagstone floor. The cost and
delay of redesigning these installations would be prohibitive, but we were con­
tractually obligated to preserve &lLbistoric fabric.
In May 1983, University of Texas officials met with the staff of the Texas
Antiquities Committee to decide the disposition of the flagstone floor. They
decided:
1. That in-place preservation of the floor over concrete and under air­
conditioning equipment was not justified in a room to which the public
would not have access.
2. That the Hagstones should be salvaged and reused, with appropriate
interpretive markers, in a patio outside the building.
3. That a systematic photographic record should be made of the floor
as it was found and before the flagstones were removed.

Photographic Techniques
Because the joists supporting the first floor were only 7 feet 8 inches from
the floor, that was our maximum camera distance. At this distance a 120-mm­
format reflex camera framed an area about 36 by 40 inches in sharp focus. We
therefore set up a series of tracks at 2-foot intervals down the length of the room.

Jackson-Little Campus

15

Each track was simply two wires that were sufficiently far apart that they sup­
ported the body of the camera but allowed the lens to protrude down between
them. By exposing a frame every 3 feet along these tracks, we were able to con­
struct a complete photomosaic of the floor surface.
We directed a hand-held floodlight at a low angle to create sharp shadows
between the individual stones and to augment the sometimes weak natural light
in the kitchen. A light-meter reading was taken before every fifth exposure, and
shutter speeds were adjusted accordingly. This photomapping operation con­
sumed the efforts of three persons for most of a day, but was quite successful.
Although some of the film was not ideally exposed, the images obtained were of
sufficiently good quality that we were able to record the exact position of every
stone in the floor.
A string grid laid out at 2-foot intervals-each intersection was labeled with a
small tag-was the primary ground reference for the photomosaic. One of the
lessons we learned while cataloging the photographs was that larger tags with
numbers perhaps an inch high or larger would have been better than our discreet
little tags with numbers so small that on contact prints they could hardly be read
even with a microscope.

THE ARTIFACTS
The most interesting finds made by the construction workers were a reason­
ably well preserved fragment of a man's pleated-front shirt that was completely
buried in the loose, dry soil, and an effigy tobacco pipe (Figure 17, a).
Since the provenience of some of the artifacts from the site is rather vague,
we will discuss in detail only the contents of the kitchen and the crawl space that
bordered it on the south, where the excavation was carefully controlled. This ar­
tifact assemblage does not so much lend further proof to the dates of the use
of the kitchen as it provides, from a limited context, a series of chronological
markers that can be used in dating other Reconstruction-era sites in Texas. The
true value of Custer's kitchen lies in the fact that it was used so briefly; the space
served as a kitchen from 1859 to 1872, a total of only 13 years of the Civil War
and Reconstruction period. Some of the domestic artifacts from this kitchen that
are described here may become additions to the list of diagnostic artifacts for
this period.

Stoneware
Several sherds of a stoneware wine bottle (Figure 9) with part of the seal of
the Duchy of Nassau, which ceased to exist as a political entity in 1871, were
found in the lower part of the kitchen fill.

White Ironside China
Several patterns and makers were represented in the assemblage of white
ironstone dinnerware fragments. A passage from Elizabeth Custer's writing helps
to explain the surprising variety of patterns.

Occasionally we attempted a dinner, and , as we wanted to invite our own ladies
as well as some from the regular regiments, the table was a subject of study; for
when twenty came the dishes gave out. The staff dined early so we could have theirs,
and the southern woman who occupied two rooms in the building lent everything she
had [Custer 1971 : 230] . . . . and that on that table were the united contents of all our
mess chests, and there were not [more] saucers or dessert plates nearer than town.
We were aware that our stay in the south was limited, and made no effort to keep
enough crockery for dinners of twenty [Custer 1971: 232] .

A large baker or serving dish (Figure 10) was made by T &R Boote Co., 0
Burslem, Staffordshire, England. The registry mark indicates that the patten
(octagon shape) was registered for a three-year period beginning September 10
1851 (Wetherbee 1980: 27, 49) .
A IO-inch dinner plate (Figure 11) was made by Lives]ey and Powell & Co .
of Hanley, Staffordshire, England. T he shape was registered in 1855. The com
pany was in business from 1851 to 1866 (Wetherbee 1980: 28).
Another lO-inch dinner plate (Figure 12) was made by T. 1. and J. Mayer
of Longport, Staffordshire, England. This firm operated from 1855 to 185:
(Wetherbee 1980 : 29). The shape se<!ms to be a variant of the Memnon patten
registered by John Meir and Co. in 1857 (Wetherbee 1980 : 65).
A plain-bordered white ironstone 10-inch dinner plate (Figure 13) was mad.

went by this name from 1841 to 1851 and used a registry mark like the one on
this plate (Figure 13, c) on some later pieces (Wetherbee 1980: 28, 40). The term
felspar opaque china, rather than ironstone, is used on this mark.

The variety of patterns and marks suggests that some of the assemblage
came from mess chests of the Custer party. The decorations typical of British­
made white ironstone during the 1860s and 1870s were generally elaborate, with
ears of corn, sheaves of wheat, and vine leaves arranged in symmetrical deco­
rative profusion. But the plainer, more formal designs were characteristic of the
white earthenware production of the Staffordshire potteries in the late 1840s and
the 1850s. The one piece of pottery that may have been made at the Prospect Hill
Pottery works (Figure 16) was perhaps intrusive in the fill, but its heavy symmet­
rical edge patterns were already 20 years out of fashion in 1880. It seems more
likely that the Prospect Hill Pottery was in operation as early as the mid-1860s
and that this particular item made its way south, possibly in a Union officer's
mess chest.

Ceramic Tobacco Pipes
Three ceramic tobacco pipes were recovered . One is a slightly damaged
effigy (Figure 17 , a) of President Franklin Pierce, who served from 1853 to 1857,
and because the title President appears on the molded label, the pipe probably
was made after 1853. This pipe, which was fou nd in the crawl space adjacent to
the kitchen, was glazed with a glossy red-orange (terra cotta) slip that has been
noted on other effigy pipes (Pfeiffer 1981).
Another complete pipe (Figure 17, b) and a stem fragment (Figure 17, c) are
unglazed yellowish bisque-fired. Both were found in the caliche fill on the

These pipes may be evidence of a problem that plagued the administr
of the Blind School. The trustees' report for 1874 noted that "addiction tl
bacco" was a problem among the boys and that "this habit, so injurious t
who have not attained maturity, is especially pernicious, and unclean in the
of the blind . .. no evil habit is ... more difficult to reform or eradicate ..

Glass Bottles
Certain diagnostic features of the glass bottles may be useful for d2
other Civil War and Reconstruction-era sites in Texas . A panfil scar is a cire
glass ring on the base of a hand-blown bottle. After a bottle is blown,
gripped with a pincers or pliers while being cut at the neck to separate it frorr
blowpipe. The blowpipe, with the tubular remnant of neck glass still adherin
its tip, then is stuck against the bottle's base, and the blowpipe is held while
neck is finished. Rather than using the blowpipe with the remnant tubular p
of glass , a simple iron rod (ponti\), with a glob of hot glass on its tip, cal
pushed against the bottle base until it adheres, and the ponti I supports the b(
while it is being finished. After the finish (i.e. , the mouth) is applied, the botti

and the bottle base is severed (Blake and Colne 1880: 358-359,384). The resul­
tant scar, a raised circle of tubular glass (or a simple spot, from the glob on the
pontil's tip) is the pontil scar characteristic of hand-made mouth-blown bottles
such as made in the United States before 1857.
An iron rod pontil can be pushed against the bottle base until it adheres tern·
porarily. After the bottle finish is applied, the rod is detached by a sharp blow or
the pontil rod. The resultant circular indention, called a bare-iron pontil sca:
(Baugher-Perlin 1982), is seen on some bottles found at Texas sites of the Civi
War era (see Figure 18).
The snap case was being used in the United States by about 1857 (Encyclo
paedia Britannica 1959). By 1878 its usehad nearly supplanted the method­
described above-that produced ponti I scars (Blake and Colne 1880 : 358-359)
The snap-case is a pliers with curved jaws that grips the bottle when the blowpip
is detached and then holds the bottle as its finish is applied.
The exteriors of bottles blown into iron molds that are too hot sometime
appear as if they have been whittle marked or rough hammered. The use of who

iron molds was common in United States glass manufacturi ng by 1878; wooden
molds (water-soaked to prevent burning) were still preferred by many European
manufacturers because a smoother exterior finish could be obtained (Blake and
Colne 1880 : 358- 359, 366). The use of iron molds allows the imprinting of a
variety of symbols on the sides and bases of bottles.
Minerals or elements, including manganese , have been used since ancient
times to make new glass appear clear or to tint the glass certain colors (Brill
1963). By the 1870s it was common knowledge among glass manufacturers that
glass containing manganese turned purple with exposure to sunlight (B lake and
Colne 1880: 317), but the use of manganese to make clear glass persisted until
World War I, when German-controlled manganese supplies were not readily
available to United States manufacturers .
It can be assumed that bottles of standardized shapes and neck fi nishes and
with mold seams and/or symbols on the bases are post-Civil War and usually of
United States manufacture . Bottles with pontiI scars, whittle marks, uneven side
seams, varying thickness, irregular (hand-finished) mouths , and without subtle
horizontal striations below the necks (often a sign that they were spun in the iron ·
molds in order to obliterate the side seams) may be of pre-Civil War manufac­

Other Artifacts
The complete inventory of recovered artifacts is not given here because il
would not be of general interest. Most are in the permanent collection of the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin and are available for exami­
nation. Some specimens, such as plumbing fittings and pieces of pipe, have been
sketched, inventoried, and discarded. Badly rusted nails were counted and dis­
carded, as were sherds of window glass, fragments of furnace slag, and lumps
of coal.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The investigations at the Arno Nowotny Building (41TV61l) were of the
type that actively support and aid restoration projects. Our aims were not to il­
luminate the lifeways of nineteenth-century military men or blind children, but to
establish a few facts about a specific building. We were able to determine that the
architect's estimates from photographs of the original sizes of the east and west
wings were accurate, we found the flagstone floor of the original kitchen and
recorded it before it was removed and before the flagstones began their new life
as a patio, and we evaluated the depQsit at the bottom of the cistern.
The artifact assemblage was from the former cellar kitchen-which, ac­
cording to documentary evidence, was used between 1859 and I872-and from
the directly adjacent crawl spac;e,~White ironstone sherds like the ones found here are common at many Texas
sites of the last half of the nineteenth century, but these specimens are especially
well dated archeologically because of the unusually discrete temporal context. In
addition, research into the makers' marks and patterns of edge decoration has
shown them to be consistent with that context. So this artifaet sample is pre­
sented not as support for dating the depQsits excavated from the crawl space and
kitchen, but as a catalog of diagnostic types that may be useful for future refer­
ence. For this reason, several artifacts that are interesting, but of types not com­
monly encountered (such as the fragment of a man's pleated-front shirt-noted
earlier-and a collection of pre-BraiJIe raised letters), have not been discussed
or illustrated.
