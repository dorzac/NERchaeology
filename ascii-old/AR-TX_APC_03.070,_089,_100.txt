Keechi Creek Wind Farm

Cultural Resources Survey

Abstract
Renewable Energy Systems-Americas, Inc. (RES) proposes to build the Keechi Creek Wind Farm
and Transmission Line in Jack County. The project is not a federal undertaking. However; the developer
desires a letter of concurrence from the Texas Historical Commission (THC) State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO) that no properties listed in and/or potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) will be affected by the proposed
development. Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC) was subcontracted to perform an intensive cultural
resources survey of the proposed development locales in accordance with Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act, as amended.
Three phases of cultural resource survey performed to date for the Keechi Creek Wind Farm Project,
Jack County Texas have covered a total of 3081.2 acres. Records searches determined that no known cultural
resources and no properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SALs) fall inside or near the proposed development.
Two new historic archeological sites were found in 2008. One site is located adjacent to the 2008
Area of Potential Effect (APE) where the new construction is planned. The second site is situated inside the
proposed 2008 transmission line right-of-way (ROW). The first locale found in 2008, Site 41JA23, is an early
twentieth century house site with intact features that is potentially significant and may be eligible for listing in
the NRHP. The house site is adjacent to a planned access road and will be avoided. Site 41JA24, the second
locality, is a small localized, historic trash dump that is ineligible for listing. Site 41JA23 and 41JA24 merit
no further archeological work relative to the 2008 wind farm development.
The results of the 2011 survey season were also positive. One new historic archeological site was
found adjacent to the 2011 APE. Site 41JA40 is a mid-twentieth century house site with intact features. The
site has low research value due to its modern age although it contains native rock pen features. RES agreed to
design the layout around the house site locale and avoid the mid-twentieth century features at 41JA40.
In 2013, a third survey was mobilized to cover new areas selected for development and a new
transmission line ROW. Again an updated records search was performed and new WTGS locations and
associated cabling routes and access roads were inspected. A new transmission line ROW was selected
southeast of the wind farm and it was also inspected by APC. The results inside the APE were negative, no
new cultural resources were found during the third survey season, however; cultural resources loci were
observed in a study corridor within which the 2011 APE falls.
Based on 2008, 2011, and 2013 survey findings, APC concludes that no cultural resources eligible for
listing in the NRHP and/or as an SAL will be impacted by the proposed wind farm and that no further
investigation is warranted. APC, therefore, recommends that construction of the Keechi Creek Wind Farm
proceed without additional archeological work or consultation. Lastly, it is recommended that if cultural
resources are uncovered during construction, work should stop and APC should be notified by telephone at
(512) 398-2946. Activity should cease at the location until the find is evaluated by APC in consultation with
the Texas Historical Commission (THC).

Keechi Creek Wind Farm

Cultural Resources Survey

1.0. 2008 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Renewable Energy Systems-Americas, Inc. (RES) proposes to build the Keechi Creek Wind Farm
and Transmission Line on private land near Perrin and Jacksboro, Texas, in Jack County. The project may
be subject to federal permitting in the future by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The developer
desires a letter of concurrence from the Texas Historical Commission (THC) State Historic Preservation
Officer (SHPO) that no properties listed in and/or potentially eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) or as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) will be affected by the proposed
development.
URS, on behalf of RES, subcontracted with Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC) to perform an
intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed wind farm locale in accordance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act, as amended. A records search showed that no properties that are
eligible or potentially eligible to be listed in the NRHP are located inside the project area. A total of about
852.6 acres was intensively inspected during the survey. Two new historic archeological sites were found.
Archeological Site 41JA23 is a house site and Site 41JA24 is a trash dump.
Site 41JA23 is the late nineteenth-early twentieth century Cherryhomes Family homestead. Mr.
Thomas H. Cherrryhomes received a patent for land in Jack County in the 1890s. By 1900, the family was
living at the locale. The site contains intact features that contribute to the knowledge of local and Jack
County history. For these reasons, the Cherryhomes House Site may be potentially eligible for listing in the
NRHP and is eligible to be listed as an SAL. 41JA23 is 20-40 feet east of a proposed wind farm access road.
It will be avoided by expanding the width of the road to the west, away from the house site.
Archeological Site 41JA24 is an early to mid-twentieth century trash dump, possibly affiliated with
the house site. The site is not important to local history, is not judged to be eligible, and merits no further
work. Site 41JA24 is located in the 2008 transmission line easement and it will be avoided by spanning the
locale.
APC, therefore, concludes that no eligible cultural resources will be impacted and recommends, that
construction of the 2008 Keechi Creek Wind Farm and transmission line proceed, as planned, without
additional archeological work or consultation. Lastly, it is recommended that if during construction, any
archeological deposits are uncovered or cut into by machinery, work should stop and APC should be
contacted at (512) 398-2946. The Texas Historical Commission (THC), Division of Archeology, should also
be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. The find should be assessed by APC in consultation with the
THC, before work resumes.

1.1. 2008 KEECHI CREEK WIND FARM AND TRANSMISSION LINE PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
RES proposes to construct the first and second phase of the Keechi Creek Wind Farm in 2009
respectively. The proposed wind farm development is located on privately-owned ranch lands in Jack
County near Jacksboro and Perrin, Texas. The project may be subject to federal permitting. In addition, the
developer desires a letter of concurrence from the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)/THC that no
significant cultural resources will be affected by the proposed activity.
In 2008, URS Corporation, on behalf of RES, contracted with Antiquities Planning & Consulting
(APC), to conduct a cultural resources survey of the planned development in accordance with Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act and State of Texas Archeological Survey Standards. Results will
be used to adjust development plans, as needed, to avoid any cultural resources that are present. Any
archeological deposits or historic structures present that are eligible or potentially eligible for designation as
SALs and/or for listing in the NRHP will be avoided and will not be affected by the development. The
intent of the project sponsor is to avoid significant cultural resources.
2008 PROJECT AREA
The proposed development is located south Jacksboro, Texas (Figure 1). It is located on private
ranches and is bound by State Highway 206 on the west and bisected by US 281/199 on the east (Figure 2).
It is a region with streams, springs, wildlife, and native plant resources, and raw materials that attracted
numbers of peoples over thousands of years.
It is situated in the Cross Timbers and Prairies of North Central Texas (Miller 1975). Terrain ranges
from level to hilly with small mesas or ridge tops (Figure 3). Vegetation consists of oak and cedar forest and
short prairie grasses (Figure 4). The project area is in the Trinity River basin near the West Fork of the river.
Several major tributaries are present inside the project area and in its vicinity and are the East and West
Fork of Keechi Creek and Lost, Beans, Carroll, and Snake
Creeks. The bulk of the property has been
cleared and is used for range land and agriculture.
Soils consist of sandy and sandy clay loams in the
prairies from the Exray-Truce-Bonti and Anocon-Thurber soils
series and calcareous clays from the Hensley-Palo-Pinto and
Leray soil series over limestone in the timbers. Soils are
underlain by sandstone and limestone outcrops (Figure 5).
Average annual rainfall is 25 to 40 inches and the climate
ranges from mild summers to extreme winters. The locale is
essentially rural to semi-rural and subject to an on-going oil
and gas boom and wind energy development. Numerous new
oil/gas wells are being drilled. The county recently has been
subject to drought, high winds, and wild fires.

2008 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the Keechi Creek Wind Farm and Transmission Line ROW
where the proposed new construction is planned totals ca. 675 acres (Figure 6). The 2008 APE will include
150 WTGs pad sites (2 acres each or 300 acres), 2 office and maintenance complexes (10 acres), 2 site
compounds (10 acres), a compressor building (5 acres), 5 substation loci (25 acres), and 3 quarries (30
acres), and relocated and/or added pad sites (49 acres). Fifteen miles by 30 feet wide (54 acres) of
underground cabling will be installed and 15 miles of 40 feet wide (72 acres) access roads will be built.
Approximately, 10.7 miles of 100-feet wide transmission and/or overhead line rights-of-way (ROW) (120
acres) will be built and was examined.
Pad sites, access roads, connect and interconnect corridors, transmission line ROWS, and all
construction areas will be bladed clear of vegetation. Connects between the turbines will be placed on the
north side of the pad sites. Trenches will be dug inside connects between turbines and interconnects
between turbine strings to depths of 4 feet deep and widths of 3 feet. Excavation at turbine pad sites will
vary and will exceed 4 feet deep into bedrock. Overhead transmission lines will be built inside a 100 footwide corridor connected by substations. Poles will be erected at 500 to 800 foot intervals and at depths
exceeding 3 feet.

1.2. 2008 CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
CULTURAL CONTEXT
The reader is directed to Prikryl (1990) for a detailed discussion of previous regional archeology
which dates back to the 1920s. Prikryl presents a chronology for the upper Trinity River in North Central
Texas that can be applied to the study area (Table 1). Prehistory begins about 10,000 years ago or 8500
years before the present (BP) in the region. Native American populations of some numbers inhabited and
exploited resources in the area from the PaleoIndian period through the Late Prehistoric and into the
Historic period when reservations were created. Campsites, village sites, burials, and artifacts scatters have
been found in the county, which is known best for its part in the Texas frontier, including Forth Richardson
in Jacksboro, Texas.
Forts were constructed to protect settlers, and in 1851, Fort Belknap was established west of
Jacksboro on the Brazos River, which was the western border of the frontier (Pace and Frasier 2004:38). To
the north of the development, is Fort Richardson established in 1867 (Pace and Frasier 2004:131). The fort
is operated by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. The Southern Overland Mail/Butterfield stage route in
the 1850s-1870s connected Jacksboro and Fort Belknap and Graham. It is known today as Highway US
380. The stage coach route is located about 2 miles north west of the proposed development.
In the 1870s, Native American reservations were created on the Clear Fork of the Brazos and later,
the reservations relocated to the Indian Territory, now known as Oklahoma. Following the removal of
Native American tribes, buffalo hunters, ranchers, and speculators arrived. Historic settlement was sparse
and development slow, until the railroad arrived in Jacksboro in 1898. The area developed as a producer of
oil and gas and firewood amidst family-owned cow and calf operation and wheat farms. Inventories and
investigations of archeological sites to date have established a small body of data (Handbook of Texas
1996). More data are needed to construct a framework for regional and local models upon which to base
future studies. Much is to be learned about the human ecology and multi-cultural heritage of Jack County.

Keechi Creek Wind Farm

Cultural Resources Survey

PREVIOUS CULTURAL RESOURCES STUDIES
In 2008, less than twenty known archeological sites were recorded in Jack County. Local baseline
data were lacking and little regulatory work has been performed in the county, until recently. As the DallasFort Worth Metroplex/Interstate 20 corridor grows and encroaches from the east, and City of Abilene’s
growth from the west, increased new construction has accelerated cultural resources work in the region.
Historic Fort Richardson and frontier period historic sites are the most common resources
investigated in Jack County. Other historic site types known to be in the region include stage coach roads,
dug outs, isolated grave sites, ranch headquarters, mines, Native American camps, and Anglo-American
buffalo hunting camps, and settlers homesteads. A limited number of prehistoric and historic Native
American archeological sites are present in the Lost Creek, Cottonwood Creek, and/or Keechi Creek
drainages.
Archeological data recovery investigations from 1972 to 1998 in the Jacksboro area focused on the
Texas Frontier Fort period and Fort Richardson State Historic Park. The location of the commissary and
quarter masters buildings were excavated (Lorraine 1973); the Enlisted Man’s Barracks, Picket Officers
Quarters, and Officer’s Kitchen (Dickson 1976); and the Bakery (Robeson 1973).
City of Jacksboro water treatment plants locales were inspected in 1981 and 1995 by Texas Water
Resources Department technicians (Fox 1981 and Fox et al. 1995). Four hundred acres at Lost Creek
Reservoir was surveyed by US Army Corps of Engineer archeologists in 1986. State Department of
Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT) and or Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) staff
visited Farm to Market Roads and Bridges at six locales across Jack County from 1987 to 1996. From 2000
to 2007, four energy related surveys were performed by multiple firms for transmission line projects (Cliff
2002, Jarvis et al. 2004, King 2003, and Pemberton et al. 2008).
King (2003) examined 205 acre and one historical archeological site with a log structure, cistern,
collapsed cellar and artifact concentration was found near Joplin, southeast of the Keechi Creek Wind Farm.
Jarvis (2004) inspected 194 acres and found two new historic farmstead sites in Wise County. Pemberton et
al. (2008) covered 1367.s acres along a 160-foot wide ROW and found 11 new cultural resources including
seven prehistoric sites and four historic sites, four of which are in Jack County. One survey covered the
proposed 640-acre Jacksboro Landfill locale and was negative in results (Skinner 2004).
RESEARCH DIRECTION
The project locale contains Medium to High-Probability Areas for the presence of archeological
resources due to its proximity to the frontier fort and stage coach road, hydrologic, topographic, and
physiographic settings. Previously known archeological sites in the region contain temporally diagnostic
features and artifacts rendering their research value high and making them potentially eligible for listing in
the NRHP and/or for SAL status and are properties that should be avoided. Inventory of the cultural
resources present is needed to identify important properties for avoidance and to collect new data about
local and regional prehistory and history for regional models and chronologies.
The research purpose of the survey is to collect new data that contribute to the knowledge of the
culture history of the region and county. The goals of the survey are to inspect the project area to determine
if any significant cultural resources are present and to formulate avoidance plans and management
recommendations for the development. APC has summarized its findings in a technical report for
management purposes and for regulatory consultation with the THC.

METHODS
Background Research
APC reviewed records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the THC, the
Texas State Library (TSL), Texas General Land Office (GLO), the Jack County Museum, and the Jacksboro
Public Library. Site files and pertinent archeological literature were reviewed. Maps and indices were
checked to determine if any significant historic properties are located inside the proposed development area.
The records search showed that no known cultural resources or properties listed in the NRHP or as SAL
present inside the proposed development area.
Pedestrian Survey
The survey was divided into the following tasks. Task 1 consisted of background research prior to
field work. Task 2 was examination of creek crossings that may be jurisdictional waterways subject to
federal permitting. Task 3 was the pedestrian survey of turbine pad sites, substations, office complex, site
compound, and compressor station. Task 4 consisted of the survey of access roads and utility corridors
between turbines. Electrical connect trenches (3 feet wide and 4 feet deep) and roads 36 feet wide will be
constructed inside the corridors. Most activity will occur 75 feet to the north side of the pads. Task 5
included the survey of the overhead transmission line right-of-way. Task 6 was to be shovel testing at
locations with less than 30 percent visibility and/or in areas with soils that could contain buried cultural
deposits, however; no such settings were encountered. Task 7 consisted of site documentation at newly
found sites.
Block-fashion survey was performed at turbine pad sites and linear fashion survey was performed
for ancillary features. The pedestrian survey consisted of a pedestrian inspection of affected areas
performed by 1-2 technicians. The proposed development area was evaluated for management purposes and
divided into HPAs and Low Probability Areas (LPAs). The estimated rate of survey in the HPAs is 1-2
miles/15 acres per person per day and in LPAs is 2-3 miles/15 acres per day. HPAs inside the project area
will be systematically inspected using parallel pedestrian transects spaced at 10-15 meters intervals. The
transect interval for LPAs will be increased to 20-30 meters.
Subsurface Investigation and Artifact Collecting and Analysis
Shovel tests were not excavated at regular intervals, because rocky ground cover and ground surface
visibility exceeded 30 percent. Alluvial settings encountered at 45 creek crossing locations visited by APC
provided cut bank views of buried sediments, most very shallow. No buried archeological deposits or
cultural horizons were observed. No diagnostic artifacts were observed in cut banks; no artifacts were
collected for analysis or curation.
Site Recordation
The recording of new archeological sites included the completion of a Texas Archeological Site
Data Form and registration of the site in the TexSite database. No shovel testing was implemented at new
sites, due to high surface visibility. APC described site extent, archeological deposit depths, artifact content,
and evaluated eligibility status. APC completed archeological field notes including field sketch maps, as
needed. APC plotted all newly recorded sites on USGS 7.5' topographic quad maps.
APC documented conditions affecting the potential integrity of new cultural resources present
inside the APE. In addition, site deposits were assessed as to the extent to which the integrity of the
deposits may have been compromised by previous disturbance and/or land alteration. Condition and
significance evaluations were performed for each new site.

1.3. 2008 SURVEY RESULTS
INTRODUCTION
The results of the 2008 Keechi Creek Wind Farm and Transmission Line survey were positive and
demonstrated the no significant historic properties or archeological sites will be affected by the proposed
activity. New historic data were collected relative early ranching development in Southern Jack County.
Limited new spatial data about local historic settlement patterns were gathered. Two historic archeological
sites were found adjacent to and inside of the proposed 2008 APE (Table 2). Site 41JA23 is the
Cherryhomes family homestead. Site 41JA24 is a historic trash dump associated with Site 41JA23.
Archeological site descriptions are in Appendix I and Site Location Data is in Appendix II. In addition to
the survey, a fatal flaw site visit was made to areas outside the APE, where thirteen cultural resources were
seen which are listed in Appendix III.
INSIDE APE
Site 41JA23 is a late nineteenth to early twentieth century homestead. It is potentially eligible for
listing in the NRHP or as an SAL because of its affiliation with the Cherryhomes family who were early
settlers. Site 41JA24 is a trash dump located on the Cherryhomes Ranch that is not eligible for listing. The
sites will be added to project maps and avoided. For this reason, construction can proceed at all locations
without additional work. (Update Note: In 2011 the Cherryhomes ranch was removed from the development
and Site 41JA23 and 41JA24 no longer fall inside or adjacent to the 2013 Layout).

OUTSIDE APE
Fourteen cultural resources loci were observed outside of the 2008 APE (Table 3). The loci are
historic in age and are made up of three historic cemeteries, eight archeological sites, two railroad features,
and one historic erosion control feature. The archeological sites include three historic cemeteries; two
nineteenth century house sites, rock corral, and rock pen; and twentieth century four rock walls/fences.
The Keith cemetery is a small group of 19th century graves and is not in use and due to its age and
content is considered an archeological site. The Springdale Cemetery and the Henderson Cemetery are 19th
and 20th century historic burial grounds and are still in use in the 21st century. The three cemeteries are
significant to local history and contain sensitive human remains protected by state law. The Keith Cemetery
is eligible for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) and for a historical marker designation.

Keechi Creek Wind Farm

Cultural Resources Survey

The Hensley House site is the original homestead of the grandparents of the Hackley family. It was
occupied from the 1860s to 1880s and today the locale has intact features, including a collapsed dugout. The
site is archeological and study of the locale has the potential to add important new data related to pioneer
settlers on the Texas Frontier. The Henderson Springs pioneer house site is also a 19th century archeological
site with intact features and archeological deposits. It contains rock walls and pens constructed in a typical
fashion of the time and region. The two house sites have high research value and are potentially eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and as a SAL and should be avoided.
All cemetery locations and the two potentially eligible house site loci should be placed on project
maps, buffered by 100 feet, and avoided. Unrelated to the wind farm development, the archeological sites
need to be recorded and registered. Oral histories need to be recorded for the family cemeteries and their
locations, especially the Keith Cemetery, need to be recorded and registered as archeological sites. Native
stone industrial and railroad features may be architecturally significant and should be avoided, if possible.

DISCUSSION
The 2008 studies of the Keechi Creek Wind Farm locale provided new data related to area
prehistoric and historic settlement patterns. Negative data show that upland locations situated at the
headwaters of Lost Creek, East Keechi Creek, and West Keechi Creek are LPAs for prehistoric cultural
resources. This fact is likely due to the proximity infrequency of reliable water sources in the upland and
head waters settings. Conversely, the uplands were found to be HPAs for historic archeological sites,
probably for similar reasons, settlement was not successful until water well drilling technology became
available.
Historic loci were most often found near springs. Other characteristics common to historic sites
observed were overlook views and road access. Historic sites are often associated with persons important to
Jack County local and regional history. Despite the fact that historic sites are present, does not preclude
development of the wind farm. Any impacts to archeological the sites can be avoided by restricting road
widening to one side and by spanning the transmission over the locale.

1.4. 2008 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CONCLUSIONS
The 2008 Keechi Creek Wind Farm and Transmission Line cultural resources survey results
contributed new data about the history of the project area and central Jack County. Survey data collected in
2008 reflect the presence of Texas frontier pioneer ranch families and the absence of Native American
habitation areas. Archeological Site 41JA23, the early twentieth century Cherryhomes House Site, is
important to local and Jack County history. For this reason, RES has agreed to avoid the locale.
Archeological Site 41JA24, an early twentieth century trash dump on the Cherryhomes Ranch is not
important to local history and avoidance is not necessary. Based on these facts, APC, therefore, concludes
that no eligible or potentially eligible significant cultural resources will be affected by the construction of
the 2008 Keechi Creek Wind Farm Layout and Transmission Line right-of-way, as planned.
RECOMMENDATIONS
In 2008, RES agreed with APC recommendations to avoid Archeological Site 41JA23 by restricting
road widening to the west away from the site. In addition, RES agrees to avoid Archeological Site 41JA24
inside the Transmission Line Right-of-Way by spanning it. APC, therefore, recommended that construction
of the 2008 Keechi Creek Wind Farm and Transmission Line proceed, as planned, with no additional
archeological investigation and with two conditions.
First, if design plans should change, the new locations should be examined for the presence of
cultural resources. Lastly, it is recommended that if cultural resources are uncovered during construction,
work should stop and APC should be notified by telephone at (512) 398-2946. Activity should cease at the
location until the find is evaluated by APC in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission (THC).
The THC concurred with findings and reservations for the 2008 wind farm and transmission line
route layouts and the 2008 draft report was accepted (Figure 7). The project as planned, will not affect
significant cultural resources and construction can proceed without further work.

2.0. 2011 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
After a three year hiatus, the Keechi Creek Wind Farm development in Jack County, Texas, became
active again in 2011. The Keechi Creek Wind Farm 2008 layout was redesigned and portions will not be
built. The location was shifted west and the name changed; it is now called Keechi Wind Farm. The
Cherryhomes Ranch property east of US Highway 281 has been omitted and portions of the Hackley and
Cook ranches west of the highway were added. The new layout sits between State Highway 4 (SH4), on the
west, and US Highway 281, on the east. The developer’s name has changed and is now called Renewable
Energy Sources-America Developments, Inc. (RES). The company in charge of environmental permitting
for the 2011 project layout is HDR Engineering, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Keechi Wind Farm project in 2011 is not a federal undertaking. However, the project may be
permitted by a federal agency in the future, pending results of environmental studies. For this reason, RES
requests concurrence from the THC/SHPO that no significant cultural resources listed in the NRHP and/or
as SAL are present inside the 2011 layout that will be affected by the proposed modifications to the
development. APC, on behalf of RES, and under contract to HDR, performed additional survey
investigation for the project. The 2011 cultural resources survey was conducted in accordance with Section
106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), and THC
rules and regulations.
It is estimated that the 2011 Keechi Wind Farm APE measures 644.4 acres. The 2011 non-linear
APE measured 299 acres in area and was comprised of 62 WTGs (4.5 acres each or 279 acres), O&M
Facility (10 acres), switchyard (5 acres), and a substation (5 acres). The 2011 linear APEs total 227.5 acres
and is made up of 27 miles of roads (40 feet wide or 129.6 acres) and 27 miles of cabling and connects (30
feet wide or 97.5 miles).
The 2011 survey area covered about 612.5 acres inside the study corridor which measured ca. 3240
acres in area. The results were positive; one new archeological site was found inside the study corridor
surveyed and outside the APE. Site 41JA40 is an early twentieth century farmstead with intact dry-stacked
native rock pens. WTG 21 and an access road are planned for the vicinity of the site. RES agreed to avoid
Site 41JA40 when designing the layout and the features will not be impacted.
APC, therefore, concluded that no eligible cultural resources would be impacted by the proposed
activities. APC recommended, therefore, that construction of the Keechi Wind Farm 2011 Layout proceed,
as planned, without additional archeological work or consultation. Lastly, it was recommended that if
during construction, any archeological deposits are uncovered or cut into by machinery, work should stop
and APC should be contacted. The THC, Division of Archeology, will be notified by APC. The find will be
assessed by APC archeologists in consultation with the THC, before work resumes. As of 2013, no
construction has begun and no unanticipated discoveries have been made.

2.1. 2011 KEECHI WIND FARM PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
RES proposed to construct the 2011 Keechi Wind Farm layout on private ranchland in North
Central Texas south of Jacksboro, in Jack County with modifications to the 2008 layout. Pending
environmental studies, the project may be subject to federal permitting and Section 106 of the NHPA. In
addition, it is the intent of the developer to avoid any cultural resources present. HDR, on behalf of RES,
contracted with APC in 2011 to perform a cultural resources survey of the new layout to locate any
archeological or historical sites present in the area where construction will take place.
2011 PROJECT AREA
The wind farm project is bounded on the east by US Highway 281 (US 281) and west of State
Highway 4 (SH4) (Figure 8). The 2011 layout is situated on the Richards Ranch owned by the Hackley
family and on the Cook Ranch owned by Paula Williams. The Cherryhomes Ranch, east of US281, is no
longer included in the project. Portions of the 2011 layout have not yet been inspected for cultural resources
and may contain significant historic resources.

Keechi Creek Wind Farm

Cultural Resources Survey

The 2011 development area, like 2008, is located in the Lower Plains physiographic region. The
project locale is drained by spring-fed streams, including Lost Creek, the East Fork of Keechi Creek, and
the West Fork of Keechi Creek, which feed the Brazos and the Trinity Rivers. Uplands soils consist on
Anocon Loam, 1 to 9 percent slope; Bonti Fine Sandy Loam, 1 to 3 percent slope, and Hensley Loam, 1 to 3
percent slope, extremely stoney. Leeray Clay, 1 to 3 percent slope, lines floodplains and Selden Loamy Fine
Sand, 1 to 3 percent slope, is present in the active floodplain. Vegetation is predominately mesquite with
oak forest and long stem grasslands.
The bulk of the project area is, however; disturbed. Multiple episodes of pushing, root plowing, oil
and gas pipelines, and burn-offs have altered the ground surface (Figure 9). Numerous natural gas pipe line
routes, flow lines, and overhead transmission line routes criss-cross the ranches. Current land use consists of
holistic range management, cattle ranching, recreational hunting, quarrying, and extensive oil and gas
exploration and production. Grasslands on the Cook Ranch appear less intensively used (Figure 10).

2011 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The 2011 APE for the proposed development at the Keechi Wind Farm will include the construction of thirteen strings of
sixty-two WTGs and totals 612.5 acres (Figure 11). An Office and Maintenance Facility (10 acres) will be built off of SH4 on the
Cook ranch. A switchyard and a substation (10 acres) will be built at the intersection of two existing transmission lines on the
Hackley Ranch. About 27 miles of cabling routes 30 feet wide (129.6 acres) will be installed. Another 27 miles of 40 feet wide
(972.acres) access roads will be constructed.

2.2. 2011 CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
CULTURAL CONTEXT
The North Central Texas region was sparsely occupied by Native Americans in prehistoric times and
in historic times contained multiple Indian reservations. Jack County was settled by Anglo-Americans in the
mid-nineteenth century and was the frontier border of Texas until after the Civil War. The project area is
located on ranches more than one hundred years old. It is about 2.4 miles south of Fort Richardson and the
Butterfield Overland Stage Route, making it an HPA for the presence of historic cultural resources.
Important to this study is the Anglo-American history of the Texas frontier and pioneer settlement
along East and West Keechi Creeks. A brief overview is presented here taken from accounts in the History of
Jack County (1985). Frontier times and families are discussed in the volume which was compiled by
members of the Jacksboro Genealogy Society. Originally, Jack County lands were part of the Peters Colony
established in the 1840s after Texas became a state. Survey and patent of land grants in the colony were
sporadic and not very successful. Permanent settlement did not begin until 1853 when the Texas General
Homestead Act was passed. In 1854, William Parmer and other stockmen settled on the West Fork of the
Keechi Creek and created large cattle herds (Paschal 1985:4).
Among early arrivals on Keechi Creek in the south part of the county and the study area was the
Hensley family, ancestors of the Hackley family. Hickman (1806-1872) and Louisa (1810-1885) Hensley
settled on East Keechi Creek in 1855 near Perrin, Texas (Hackley 2008:474). Their son, James Henry
Hensley (1828-1865) with wife Eliza Elizabeth Boone (1836-1928), set up a ranch on the headwaters of
Keechi Creek in 1865 (Hackley 1985:474).
The J.H. Hensley property would become the Richards Ranch. After James Henry’s death in 1865,
the Keechi Creek homestead was occupied by the Eliza until 1876. She then moved to ranch land she
preempted on Carroll Creek, remarried, and built a large cattle ranch (Hackley 2008:475). Willie Ruth
Hensley (1895-1978), granddaughter of James and Eliza, married Evan Carter Richards (1882-1964) in
1915. The Richards family intermarried with the Hackley family. Members of all generations of the Hensley,
Richards, and Hackley families have played prominent parts in Jack County history, ranching, commerce,
and civic development.
RECENT CULTURAL RESOURCES STUDIES
Archeological data recovery investigations from 1972 to 1998 in the Jacksboro area focused on the
Texas Frontier Fort period and Fort Richardson State Historic Park. City of Jacksboro water treatment plants
locales were inspected in 1981 and 1995 by Texas Water Resources Department technicians. Lost Creek
Reservoir was surveyed by US Army Corps of Engineer archeologists in 1986. State Department of
Highways and Public Transportation (SDHPT) and or Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) staff
visited Farm to Market Roads and Bridges at six locales across Jack County from 1987 to 1996. From 2000
to 2007, four energy related surveys were performed by firms for transmission line projects. One survey
covered the proposed Jacksboro Landfill locale.
Since 2008, a small number of survey level investigations have been performed in Jack County that
are of interest here. Dayton (2010a) conducted a survey for an 11.4-mile long (110 acres) Brazos Power
Electric Cooperative (BPEC) natural gas pipeline in Jack, Parker, and Wise Counties, Texas. The results
were negative; pedestrian inspection and 115 shovel tests yielded no new cultural resources data. Dayton
(2010b) also conducted a survey for a 12.4-mile long (73.3 acres) BPEC natural gas pipeline in Jack County.
Again, results were negative; pedestrian inspection and 96 shovel tests yielded negative findings. Latham
(2010) surveyed the Oncor Electric Jacksboro to Parker 345kV Transmission Line Project in Jack, Wise, and
Parker Counties.

Keechi Wind Farm

Cultural Resources Survey

RESEARCH DIRECTION
The research purpose of a Cultural Resources Management (CRM) survey is to add to the knowledge
of local and regional history. The goals of the 2011 Keechi Creek Wind Project CRM survey are twofold.
The first goal is to augment previous 2008 cultural resources work and update findings. The second is to
obtain concurrence from the THC/SHPO that construction will not affect significant cultural resources and
may proceed without additional CRM investigation or consultation by producing a technical document for
agency review and comment.
A part of the 2011 project area was previously inspected by APC. The 2008 project area was found
to be a HPA for twentieth century historic sites. It was determined to be a LPA for prehistoric and historic
Native American sites. Therefore, it was predicted that inside the 2011 project area, prehistoric locales will
be absent, while historic sites may be present and some of which may be affiliated with Jack County
pioneers.
For these reasons, the 2011 study focused on HPAs for the presence of historic archeological sites.
Historic map reviews revealed few public roads and/or home sites on the large ranches making up the
development. Historic accounts identified early community locations to be outside the ranches. All locations
known to have a building were visited in the study corridor, with the exception of oil and gas facilities.
2011 APE, STUDY AREA, AND SURVEY AREA
The APE for the initial 2011 layout measured 525.8 acres. The 2011 survey area exceeded the APE
in order to accommodate any future layout changes. In addition, areas previously surveyed in 2008 also fall
inside the study corridor. Described below are 2011 APE, Study Area, and Survey Area dimensions. (Note:
See next section for additional investigation of 119 acres, bringing the 2011 total APE to 644.8 acres.)
2011 Area of Potential Effect (APE)
Section 106 of the Nation Historic Preservation Act refers to new construction locations as the APE.
APC estimates the total area to be affected by construction or the preliminary APE of the 2011 Keechi Wind
Farm layout will be about 525.8 acres. It consists of non linear and linear features. Non linear areas total 299
acres and are made up of 65 WTG locales (4.5 acres each or 398 acres), an Office and Maintenance Facility
(10 acres), a switchyard (5 acres), and a substation (5 acres).
In addition, 27 miles or ca. 226.8 acres of linear routes will be constructed. Roads and cabling
routes will generally parallel each other. Roads will be gravel and will total about 27 miles in length and will
be 40 feet wide (129.6 acres). Utility corridors will parallel access roads and will be 27 miles long and 30
feet wide (97.2 acres). Also included in the project APE is vertical impact or the depth of new construction.
At wind farm pad sites, excavation will exceed 4 feet deep (beyond shovel testing limits). Under ground
utility trenches will not exceed 4 feet deep, in most cases. Geotechnical bore hole locations will placed inside
and outside the corridor and all preliminary locations were visited by APC archeologists prior to drilling.
2011 Wind Farm Survey Corridor
A study corridor 27 miles long and 1000 feet wide (3,240 acres) was established for environmental
studies for the project in 2011 (Figure 12). It is the intent of the developer to place all development features
inside the corridor. Approximately 525.8 acres or 16.2 of the study corridor may be affected by the new
construction.

2011 Wind Farm Survey Area
About 612.5 acres were intensively surveyed during the 2011 field effort. Initially, twenty five WTG
locations (6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 51, 52, and 53) and six alternate
locations (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) were examined (ca. 112.5 acres). Adjoining areas known to be LPAS (119
acres) were added to the coverage area. Also inspected were locales for a substation and switchyard locale
(10 acres), and the Office & Maintenance facility (10 acres). Lastly, segments for access roads measuring 2
miles by 40 feet (9.6 acres) and cabling routes totaling 2 miles by 30 feet wide (7.2 acres) were inspected.

METHODS
APC completed the background research for the project area prior to beginning field work. Reviews
of historic, topographic sheets, USGS maps and highway department maps (before 1960) were conducted
background research in order to identify the locations of buildings and structures older than 45 years old in
the vicinity of the proposed project. Background research and previous cultural resources work performed to
date indicates that no known archeological sites and/or historic buildings are present inside the 2011 Keechi
Wind Farm layout inspected, however; some new locations have not yet been inspected by archeologists.
Field Survey
Survey methodology followed the State of Texas Archeological Survey Standards and was
performed by qualified personnel as required by the Secretary of Interior’s Guidelines (36CFR80), as
required by the THC. Intensive survey was restricted to HPAs not previously covered in 2008.
Archeologists located WTG locations with Global Positioning System (GPS) “go-to-functions” on
hand-held Garmin72 units, using coordinates provided by the developer. WTG pad site coverage consisted of
Antiquities Planning & Consulting

19

Keechi Wind Farm

Cultural Resources Survey

areas within 500 feet of the center point. Pads were conceived of a circle measuring about 4.5 acres in size.
Inside linear features HPAs were examined in a 500-foot wide corridor 250 feet (83 meters) off centerline, as
needed. Survey transects were performed at 20-30 meter intervals at HPAs which included, upland stream
terraces, ridge tops, historic roads, and railroads. APC coverage of pad sites included initial data gathering
by pedestrian walk-over using systematic 30-meter interval transects and random pedestrian transects to
examine any cultural features encountered.
At HPAs and creek or stream crossings where trenching and new road right-of-way construction is
planned, 100 percent of the ground surface was examined within ca. 500 feet (166 meters) of channels using
pedestrian walk over and transect methodology at 20 meter intervals. Cut banks and all exposures of
subsurface soil profiles were examined for buried cultural deposits.
APC visited, but did not inspect LPAs where ground disturbance is extensive, such as, but not
limited to oil and gas fields, areas of root plowing/clearing, brush pushing, and/or land use that has
obliterated original land surfaces. APC did not perform pedestrian survey of existing roads utilized for
vehicular ingress and egress. Wind shield survey from vehicles was implemented for the 500-foot wide
corridor inspection of proposed new right-of-way easements located in HPAs yet to be determined.
Systematic shovel testing was not performed at the required rate of 1 per 3 acres, as needed, because
of disturbance and because surface visibility was greater than 40 percent. No alluvial settings with the
potential for buried cultural resources were found. Shovel testing at creek crossings was not conducted
because ground surface visibility exceeded 40 percent and cutbanks provided subsurface views.
No diagnostic artifacts were collected because none was found. Artifacts recovered from shovel
testing at Site 41JA40 were redundant glass fragments that were discarded and reburied in shovel tests. No
artifacts were collected and no artifacts were curated.
Resource Recordation
Cultural resources are defined by sciences and federal and state regulations as man-made resources
that are 45-50 years old or older. Archeological sites are defined as locations more than 100 years old with
physical remains of human occupations. Historic buildings are standing structures built before 1966.
Twentieth century oil and gas facilities were considered to be hazardous materials locations and were not
recorded as archeological sites. Late nineteenth century rail road features in use into the early twentieth
century were considered to be industrial features and were not recorded as archeological sites.
Regulations and guidelines require any new cultural resources found during the survey to be
inventoried, documented, evaluated, and management recommendations formulated by qualified personnel.
One new archeological site was found, documented, recorded, shovel tested, and evaluated for any
significance relative to local, regional, and/or national history and/or prehistory, if any. One historic building
was found and was photo-documented.
Archeological Sites. Site limits were delineated horizontally and vertically inside the APE, using
intensive pedestrian survey and subsurface examination (hand-dug shovel testing) at the minimum rate
specified in the Texas Archeological Survey Standards. Four shovel tests were hand-dug at Site 41JA40
where surface visibility was greater less than 40 percent. Contents and condition of new site deposits were
evaluated for research value.
Historic Buildings. One potential historic building was found outside the APE and inside a corridor.
Spatial data was collected for avoidance purposes. The age of the building was estimated based on
architectural style. Digital photographs of the building were also made.

2.3. 2011 SURVEY RESULTS
INTRODUCTION
The results of the 2011 Keechi Wind Farm cultural resources survey were positive. Five cultural
resources loci were observed inside the study corridors and adjacent to the 2011 APE (Table 3). One
archeological site made up of an early twentieth century house site was found near a proposed access road.
Remnants of three late nineteenth and/or early twentieth century isolated stacked rock walls/fences segments
were located near linear features. In addition, a modern historic ranch building complex was observed inside
corridors between turbine strings that will also be avoided. Of the new cultural resources none was found at
WTG locations. The survey provided new regional CRM data and showed that no significant cultural
resources will be affected by the 2011 development layout.
INSIDE THE APE
The findings of the 2011 and 2008 survey confirm that no significant cultural resources are present
where WTG construction is planned in 2011, including alternate WTG locations. Other 2011 locales
inspected which are absent of cultural resources are the proposed switchyard, substation, and the Office and
Maintenance sites. Construction may proceed, as planned at these locations inside the APE, with no further
cultural resources work.
OUTSIDE THE APE
The 1000-foot wide study corridor contains a small number of cultural resource locales, including
archeological site 41JA40, which fall near or adjacent to the APE. It is the intent of the developer to avoid
the site by rerouting linear features inside the corridor, away from archeological site 41JA40. Historic rock
wall segments are present in three locations in the corridor but away from planned roads and will not be
affected. Lastly, a modern ranch house is present, also in the corridor, but away from existing roads that will
be widened and will be avoided. It is ineligible for listing in the NRHP and or as a SAL and is used as a
residence for ranch hands.

Archeological Site
Site 41JA40 is an early twentieth century house site with intact native stone livestock pens. The
style of the pens is not pastoral typical of the early nineteenth century, but typical of local twentieth century
construction methods. Only the foundation remains of the house site and it is concrete. Subsurface shovel
testing yielded two clear glass shards from six inches below the surface. The research value of the features is
judged to be medium, while the archeological deposits are judge to have low research value. For these
reason, Site 41JA40 is judged to be ineligible for listing in the NRHP and/or as an SAL. The site lies inside
the study corridor ca. 300 feet west of an existing ranch road that will be widened from 15 feet to 40 feet for
wind farm use and will be avoided. Appendix I contains the site description and Appendix II contains a
location map.
Historic Resources
The twentieth century stacked rock wall features observed were isolated and fragmentary. Segments
of them have been pushed down. Rock has been removed and recycled for other uses at all locations (Figure
13). They appear to be early twentieth century features, but some could be nineteenth century in age.
However, certain locales using construction with the pastoral characteristic of finishing the top of the wall
with a layer of upright, angled flat stone.

Study Corridor.

The modern historic ranch house is associated with a building complex. It contains modified 1940s
metal Quonset huts, a 1960s ranch-style house (Figure 14), and a 1980s metal barn. It is in use by ranch
hands and will be avoided by the development. The historic building in the complex is a mid-to late
twentieth century frame house on a cement slab foundation with pre-fabricated siding and a composite
shingle roof. It does not possess a unique architectural style and is not affiliated with historic personages or
events important to history. The complex is operational and will be avoided and will not be affected by new
construction.

DISCUSSION
The 2011 Keechi Wind Farm survey generated additional historic settlement pattern data for the
southern Jack County area. Sparse numbers of historic resources were found related to late nineteenth and
early twentieth century Anglo-American Jack County ranching and farming. The results of the 2011 survey
support previous findings from 2008. Most historic locales were found in close proximity to springs and/or
spring-fed streams, historic roads, and/or historic railroad routes. Native sandstone and limestone was used at
all historic locations to construct rock walls, fences, pens, corrals, building foundations, and cellars and to
encase springs. New data about site size and features were collected, showing house sites were 2 acres in size
and most have intact features made from locally available, cut and dressed, native stone.
Absent from the 2011 area surveyed was any evidence of prehistoric Native American occupations,
including at springs. No well-developed, well drained alluvial sediments were found. Surface water and
streams crossings visited were few and did not contain any cultural material on the surface or in shallow
cutbanks. Two karst features were observed and their presence shows the area is a recharge zone for
underground water sources and headwaters. Also absent from the ground surface were flint and /or chert rock
used for flint knapping. Fire-cracked rock was observed, but it was the result of annual controlled burn-offs.
In many cases, land use management, ranching, and oil and gas exploration and production have
disturbed the land surface and cultural resources. Nineteenth century historic rock walls, fences, and or pens
were located away from house sites on drainages and steep slopes and functioned as run-ff control. The
ranchlands inspected have been intensively managed since the 1860s. Modern root plowing, brush pushing,
and burn-offs have extensively altered the original ground surface in all pastures inspected. Most pastures
possess numerous bedrock and boulder outcrops of sandstone and limestone with little or no soil
development that will be affected by the new construction, as planned in 2011.

2.4. 2011 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CONCLUSIONS
The results of the 2011 Keechi Wind Farm CRM survey showed that construction of the wind
energy facility will not affect any significant cultural resources and contributed new knowledge related to
local history. One new archeological site was found and new data were collected that contribute to the
knowledge of Jack County history. Archeological site 41JA40 is an early twentieth century house site with
intact, stacked rock animal pens. Site 41JA40 will not be affected by the road widening and, therefore; no
further CRM work is necessary at the site before construction begins.
Probability data were also gathered during the survey effort. Pastures on the Richards Ranch and the
Cook Ranch were determined to be LPAs for cultural resources and comprised the bulk of the study area.
HPAs were found to be locales adjacent to springs and historic roads, most of which fall inside planning
corridors and outside locales where construction will take place.
Based on 2008 and 2011 survey results, APC concluded that no cultural resources eligible for NRHP
and /or SAL status are present inside the APE that will be affected by the development. Site 41JA40 will be
avoided and will not be impacted by the road widening. For these reasons, no additional CRM work or
consultation is necessary before construction begins.
RECOMMENDATIONS
APC recommended that construction 2011 layout of the Keechi Wind Farm proceed, as planned,
without additional CRM investigation or consultation, with two conditions. First, if any changes to the layout
are made outside the corridors examined, the new locales should be inspected by APC archeologists. Second,
RES should notify subcontractors that, if during construction, unanticipated archeological or historical
deposits are uncovered, work should stop at the locale. APC should be notified by telephone at (512) 3982946 of the discovery. APC will notify the THC of the discovery by telephone at (512) 463-6096. The
discovery should be evaluated by APC in consultation with the THC before any digging resumes.
In August and September of 2011, the THC concurred with interim draft findings and reservations
for the 2011 wind farm and transmission line route layouts (Figure 15). In October, after submittal of the
draft document was accepted and final concurrence was received (Figure 16).

2.6. ADDITIONAL 2011 KEECHI WIND FARM LAYOUT MODIFICATIONS
INTRODUCTION
APC was notified by HDR in October of 2011 that minor modifications were made to the final RES
2011 Keechi Wind Farm layout. Changes include the addition of 119 acres to the development locale. This
modification increased the 2011 APE of the wind farm to 644.8 acres in area. For management purposes, the
additional parcels were given letter designations of A through F (Figure 17).
METHODS
APC personnel reviewed the additional locations using previous data collected to determine if
further cultural resources survey is needed. Proximity to known cultural resources was calculated.
Conditions and land use of the locales, as observed during the survey, were considered. Previous findings
about adjacent tracts were also taken into account. From these data, the probability of finding additional
cultural resources in each area and/or the need for additional CRM survey was evaluated for each area.

2011 Additional Lands Layout
Final WTG locales were shifted about 1000 feet resulting in the addition of ca. 119 acres to the
study corridor previously inspected (Figure 18). Area A is about 10.5 acres in area. Area B East and West
total 21 acres. Area C is comprised of 15 acres. Areas D, E, and F together measures ca. 71.7 acres.
The environmental setting in Area A consists of upland pasture overlooking Lost Creek. Area B East
and West and Areas C, D, E, and F are upland locales located away from year round water sources. Located
in the vicinity of Area A and D are known cultural resources and modern cement features. Area B West may
contain a standing barn structure older than 50 years old.

Antiquities Planning & Consulting

28

Keechi Wind Farm

Cultural Resources Survey

Area A
Area A is 1,098 feet north of archeological Site 41JA40. The site is made up of an early twentieth
century homestead and native stone rock pen complex. In addition, two locations believed to be midtwentieth century oil and gas facilities are located within 927 -1673 feet of Area A. The northern, southern,
and western perimeters of Area A were viewed from the road during the previous survey. No cultural
resources were observed.
Area A is judged to be a Medium Probability Area (MPA) for historic cultural resources and a High
Probability Area (HPA) for the presence of isolated, modern, mid-twentieth century cement features believed
to be oil and gas related. However, the majority of the area has been cleared pasture and the ground surface
has been disturbed by ranch activity, and probably by oil and gas production. Therefore, no additional
cultural resources survey work is needed at the locale.
Area B East
No known archeological sites are located in close proximity to Area B East. The area was examined
during the original survey of WTG 47 in 2008. Area B East contains no cultural resources. Therefore, no
additional survey work is needed.
Area B West
No known archeological sites are located in the vicinity of Area B West. Area B West was not
visited, however; WTG locales adjacent to the northern limit of the area were visited. Rocky terrain and
cleared pasture were encountered and the land form was found to be a LPA.
A barn of at least 40 years of age is shown on maps inside Area B West. It is not known if the barn
is still standing. If it is standing, the developer agrees to avoid it. Due to avoidance plans, no further site
work is merited.
Areas C, D, and E
Area C is located 4,963 feet from Site 41JA40. The western part of Area D is 1098 feet south, south
west of the western end of Cultural Resources Loci 6. The locale is the nineteenth century Henderson
Springs archeological site observed during fatal flaw studies in 2008 and now falls outside of the APE and
the study corridor. Area E is not located near any recorded archeological or historical site locations.
Areas C, D, and E are located in a large pasture that has been extensively modified by holistic range
management and brush clearing practices. Large parts of the pasture, including Area C, have been examined
for cultural resources with negative results. The previous survey results show that Area D and E are LPAs for
the presence of significant cultural resources and do not warrant additional survey.
Area F
Surveys of numerous WTG locales were completed adjacent to Area F to the south. Results were
negative. No cultural resources were found. In addition, this area is comprised mostly of side slopes, exempt
from survey requirements. For these reasons, no further cultural resources survey is necessary in Area F.
DISCUSSION
One archeological site and two mid-twentieth century features believed to be oil and gas facility
remnants are located in the vicinity of Area A. Land use practices, however, have previously impacted the
ground surface. For this reason, the locale is judged to be an LPA for the presence of significant cultural
resources. Areas B East and B West, C, D, E, and F are also judged to be LPAs for the presence of
significant cultural resources due to previous land use impacts. Therefore, Areas A through F do not have the
potential to contain significant cultural resources eligible for listing in the NRHP and/or as a SAL.

2.7. 2011 ADDITIONAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
C0NCLUSIONS
The additional lands joined to the 2011 wind farm layout were found to be LPAs for the presence of
cultural resources. No known cultural resources or properties listed in the NRHP and/or as SAL will be
affected by the proposed inside additional new construction, Areas A through F which are adjacent to the
2011 study corridor. Archeological site 41JA40 will be avoided by the developer. Cultural Resource Loci 6
is outside of the APE and will not be affected by wind farm construction. In addition, sufficient data were
collected during the previous survey effort to extrapolate findings to additional areas A through F. For these
reasons, APC concludes that no additional cultural resources survey work is warranted.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the review of previous data collected, APC recommends that construction of the 2011
layout of the Keechi Wind Farm proceed as planned, in Areas A to F, without additional cultural resources
survey. Lastly, it is recommended that if during construction, any unanticipated archeological or historical
deposits are uncovered; work should stop at the locale. APC should be notified of the discovery by
telephone at (512) 398-2946. APC will notify THC of the discovery. The discovery will be evaluated by
APC in consultation with the THC, before any digging resumes.
In November of 2011, the THC concurred with APC findings and additional findings and
recommendations for the 2011 wind farm and transmission line route layouts (Figure 19). It was determined
that the project as planned in 2008, will not affect significant cultural resources. Construction can proceed
without further cultural resources work.

3.0. 2013 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The RES Keechi Creek Wind Farm development in Jack County, Texas, became active again in
2013. The 2011 Keechi Creek Wind Farm layout was redesigned and portions will not be built. The
development was expanded to the north and east. The 2013 layout sits between SH206 on the west, and
SH199, on the east. The Keechi Wind Farm project in 2013 is not a federal undertaking.
RES desires concurrence from the THC/SHPO that no significant cultural resources listed in the
NRHP and/or as SAL are present inside the 2013 layout that will be affected by the proposed modifications
to the development. HDR Engineering, Minneapolis, Minnesota, on behalf of RES, contracted with APC to
complete a third season of survey for the project. The 2013 cultural resources survey was conducted in
accordance with Section 106 of NHPA, the ACT, and THC rules and regulations.
It is estimated that the 2013 Keechi Wind Farm APE measures 666.2 acres. The non-linear APE
(666. 2 acres) was comprised of 55 WTGs (4.5 acres each or 247.5). The linear APE totals 147.1 acres and is
made up of 11.5 miles of roads (40 feet wide or 57.4 acres) and 27.4 miles of cabling and connects (30 feet
wide or 89.7 miles).
The 2013 survey area covered about 1497.1 acres inside the study corridor which measured ca. 3577
acres in area. The results were positive; six new cultural resources loci were observed in study corridors. One
section of historic railroad grade was found in the vicinity of WTG 21. Three locations with historic
buildings identified adjacent on in close proximity to the transmission line ROW. Two new prehistoric
archeological sites were found inside the study corridor surveyed. Of the six new loci, all fall outside the
2013 APE and will not be affected.
APC, therefore, concluded that no significant cultural resources eligible or potentially eligible for
listing in the NHHP or as SALS will be impacted by the proposed activities. APC recommended, therefore,
that construction of the Keechi Wind Farm 2013 Layout proceed, as planned, without additional
archeological work or consultation. Lastly, it was recommended that if during construction, any
archeological deposits are uncovered or cut into by machinery, work should stop and APC should be
contacted. The THC, Division of Archeology, will be notified by APC. The find will be assessed by APC
archeologists in consultation with the THC, before work resumes. As of 2013, no construction has begun and
no unanticipated discoveries have been made.

3.1. 2013 KEECHI CREEK WIND FARM PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
RES proposes to construct the 2013 Keechi Wind Farm layout and transmission line on the same
private property south of Jacksboro and north of Perrin, Texas, as planned in 2011. The project is not subject
to federal permitting and Section 106 of the NHPA, and at the time of writing, it is not a federal undertaking.
It is the intent of the developer to avoid any cultural resources present. HDR, on behalf of RES, contracted
with APC to perform a cultural resources survey of new parts of the 2013 layout to locate any archeological
or historical sites present in the area where construction will take place.
2013 PROJECT AREA
The 2013 Keechi Creek Wind Farm project area has been expanded to the north and WTG locales
have been added to the ends of existing strings of turbines (Figure 20). The 2013 wind farm project area
measures about 8600 acres and is still bounded on the east by US Highway 281 (US 281) and on the west by
SH206. The current layout is situated on the Richards Ranch owned by the Hackley family and on the Cook
Ranch owned by Paula Williams and consists of a total of 55 WTGs. Of the 55 locations, 17 new WTG
locations (1-11, 22-23, 26-27, 50-51), have been added to the 2011. These WTGs and their associated access
roads and cabling routes make up the 2013 wind farm study area for cultural resources. In addition, a
transmission line will be constructed between the wind farm and an existing substation.

Environmental settings encountered in 2013 wind farm layout are the same as in previous surveys.
The 2013 project locale is drained by spring-fed streams, the East Fork of Keechi Creek, Beans Creek, and
Little Beans Creek which feed the Brazos and the Trinity Rivers. The project is in the Cross Timbers region
characterized by mixed oak forests and long stem grasslands (Figure 21). Uplands soils consist on Anocon
Loam, Bonti Fine Sandy Loam, Hensley Loam, extremely stoney. Leeray Clay lines floodplains and Selden
Loamy Fine Sand, is present in the active floodplain.
The bulk of the wind farm project area has been disturbed by land use practices. Properties have
been subjected to multiple episodes of pushing, root plowing, oil and gas pipelines construction, and burnoffs have altered the ground surface (Figure 22). Pipe line routes, flow lines, fiber optic cable, and overhead
transmission line routes criss-cross the ranches. Current land use consists of holistic range management,
cattle ranching, recreational hunting, quarrying, and extensive oil and gas production.

Transmission Line Alignment
The 2013 Transmission Line route has been moved off the Cherryhomes Ranch and is in a new
location from the route investigated in 2008. The 2013 proposed route leaves the Richards Ranch in the
southeast part of the wind farm project area and crosses multiple private small tracts to the east of the wind
farm (Figure 23). The 2013 transmission line APE will be ll.2 miles by 100 feet wide or about 147.6 acres.
The ROW follows existing features, generally property. The ROW is oriented northwest to southeast
on the Richards Ranch and turns east to west near Pump Station Road and enters more tracts owned and
managed by the Hackley family. From Pump Station Road the Route extends eastward and parallels and/or

SH199, before ending at an existing substation on SH199. East Keechi Creek, Beans Creek, and Little Beans
Creek will be also be crossed by the ROW and are HPAs for the presence of cultural resources. Soils along
the ROW are loams, sandy clay loams, sandy clay and clay (Table 5).

Along the 12.3 transmission line ROW, a variety of settings and land uses were observed. Hilly oak
woods with boulder outcrops, grassy deflated low ridges and hilltops, open plowed fields, and wooded
floodplains are present (Figure 24). Elevation ranges from 1320 ft amsl at the project start to 1070 ft amsl at
the project end. Two alluvial derived sediments are present that may have the potential to contain buried
cultural resources and they are located along the East Fork of Keechi and Beans Creeks. The ROW spans
semi-rural, urban, industrial, energy production, and agricultural areas. Accelerated oil and gas activity and
quarrying are ongoing. Areas of high visibility were frequently encountered inside the transmission line
study corridor (Figure 25).

2013 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In all, the 2013 APE for the Keechi Creek Wind Farm and Transmission Line ROW measures about
666.2 acres (Figure 26). The 2013 project APE has been extended to the north and a new string of turbines
has been added north of the Richards/Burkett gravel pit operation. It was also extended on the east and two
new WTGs were added to existing strings. Southeast strings were eliminated. Other existing strings were
shifted north or south within the boundaries of the 2011 Study corridors. The 2013 APE consists of multiple
components and will be comprised of the construction of 55 WTGs, 36.23 miles of cabling and of access
roads in the wind farm project area. Lastly, the transmission line APE is 12.3 miles long by 100 feet wide.

3.2. 2013 CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Section 1 and Section 2 of this document briefly discuss cultural contexts for the Keechi Creek Wind
Farm Project area. The discussion also applies to the 2013 wind farm and transmission line ROW locations.
Of interest here, are the results of an updated literature search of the Jack County Area. Atlas abstract records
were reviewed to identify studies recently conducted. Since 2011, the construction of new transmission lines
to distribute wind generated power has resulted in the performance of cultural resources work in Jack
County.
Smith and Cliff (2011) conducted an intensive survey of the Oncor Electric 46.7-mile Bowman to
Jacksboro Transmission Line Rebuild in Archer, Clay, and Jack Counties, Texas. Two new archeological
sites were found and documented in Jack County. One is a late 19th century historic artifact scatter and one is
a prehistoric artifact scatter. Fullerton et al. (2013) conducted a survey level investigation for the 110-mile
345kV Clear Crossing to Willow Creek Transmission Line in Wise, Jack, Young, and Haskell Counties,
Texas. Eighteen new cultural resources and twenty-eight isolated finds were encountered and recorded
during the survey. The new sites included ten prehistoric sites (lithic scatter, shell midden), seven 19th and
20th century historic sites (farmstead), and one historic and prehistoric site.
RESEARCH DIRECTION
The research purpose of any CRM survey is to add to the knowledge of local and regional history.
The goals of the 2013 Keechi Creek Wind Project CRM survey are twofold. The first goal is to augment
previous 2008 and 2011 cultural resources work and findings by collecting new cultural resources data. The
second is to obtain concurrence from the THC/SHPO that construction in new locales will not affect
significant cultural resources and may proceed without additional CRM investigation or consultation by
producing a technical document for agency review and comment.
Parts of the 2013 project area were previously inspected by APC in 2008 and 2011. The 2008 and
2011 project areas were found to contain HPAs for historic sites and LPAs for prehistoric sites. Therefore, it
was predicted that inside the 2013 project wind farm project area, prehistoric locales will be absent, while
historic sites may be present and may be affiliated with Jack County pioneers. The transmission line ROW,
however, crosses creeks known to be HPAs for the presence of prehistoric archeological sites and is believed
to contain HPAs.
For these reasons, the 2013 study focused on HPAs for the presence of historic and prehistoric and
historical archeological sites. All creek crossing were visited. Historic map reviews revealed few public
roads and/or home sites on the large ranches making up the wind farm development, while historic building
can be found in the vicinity of the transmission line ROW on the smaller tracts. All locations known to have
a building were visited in the study corridor, with the exception of oil and gas facilities.
2013 APE, STUDY AREA, AND SURVEY AREA
For the Keechi Creek Wind Farm Project in 2013, there are two broad APEs where new construction
will take place, one for the wind farm and one for the transmission line. In order to accommodate any future
layout changes a 1000-foot wide study corridor around new construction features established in 2011 was
expanded in the north part of the wind farm project area and along three turbine strings. In addition to the
wind farm project study area, a study corridor devised as a fatal-flaw type study area for the transmission line
alignment and was checked for the presence of known cultural resources.

2013 Wind Farm APE
In all, 394.6 acres make up APE for the 2013 WTG layout of the Keechi Creek Wind Farm (Figure
27). It is made up of 55 WTG locations (5.4 acres each or 247.5 acres). In addition, 36.23 miles (or ca. 147.1
acres) of linear road and cabling routes will be constructed inside the wind farm project area. Roads will be
gravel and will total about 11.5 miles in length and will be 40 feet wide (57.4 acres). Utility corridors will
parallel access roads and will be 24.8 miles long and 30 feet wide (89.7 acres).
Also included in the project APE is vertical impact or the depth of new construction. At wind farm
pad sites, excavation will exceed 4 feet deep (beyond shovel testing limits). Under ground utility trenches
will not exceed 4 feet deep, in most cases. Geotechnical bore hole locations will placed inside and outside
the corridor and all preliminary locations were visited by APC archeologists prior to drilling.

A study corridor measuring 12.3 miles long by 1000 feet wide (1476 acres) was created for the 2013 transmission line ROW (Figure 31). The
corridor was checked for the presence of known cultural resources, including for properties listed on the NRHP and/or as SALs. Pertinent literature
related to previously implemented studies during background research for the project. During the field survey, parts of the corridor were visited
and/or intensively inspected.

2013 Transmission Line Survey Area
The 2013 survey area for Keechi Creek Wind Farm the Transmission Line varied from 1000 feet wide to 250 feet wide (1436.7 acres). On the
Hackley/Richards ranch the 1000–foot wide study corridor was able to be maintained, however, off the ranch, on smaller tracts, the corridor had to be
narrowed. Approximately 10.4 miles (1379.7 acres) of the 12.3 mile long ROW was covered during the survey. ROW measuring 6.1 miles by 250
feet wide (867.3 acres) were examined and included intensive inspection of six HPAs (Figure 32). About 4.3 miles by 1000 feet wide (512.4 acres)
were also examined. Short segments about 1.9 miles long by 250 feet (57 acres) of the ROW were not inspected and were omitted due to dense brush,
woods with dense understory, and/or lack of access caused by locked gates.

METHODS
As in 2008 and 2011, in 2013, APC completed the background research for the project area prior to
beginning field work. Updated reviews of historic, topographic sheets, USGS maps and highway department
maps (before 1960) were conducted background research in order to identify the locations of buildings and
structures older than 45 years old in the vicinity of the proposed new project locales. Background research
and previous cultural resources work performed to date indicates that no known archeological sites and/or
historic buildings are present inside the 2013 Keechi Wind Farm layout inspected.
Field Survey
Survey methodology followed the State of Texas Archeological Survey Standards and was
performed by qualified personnel as required by the Secretary of Interior’s Guidelines (36CFR80), as
required by the THC. Intensive survey was restricted to HPAs and accessible tracts not previously covered
in 2008 and in 2011.
The proposed development areas were evaluated for management purposes and divided into HPAs
and LPAs. The 2013 field survey was divided into four tasks. Task 1 was the pedestrian survey of newly
selected turbine pad sites and ancillary features. Task 2 was examination of creek crossings that may be
jurisdictional waterways subject to federal permitting. Task 3 included the survey of the overhead
transmission line right-of-way. Task 4 was shovel testing at locations with less than 30 percent visibility
and/or in areas with soils that could contain buried cultural deposits, however; no such settings were
encountered.
The 2013 pedestrian survey consisted of inspection of undisturbed, affected areas performed by 1-2
technicians. Block-fashion survey was performed at turbine pad sites by two technicians walking at intervals
of 10-20 meters apart. Linear fashion surveys were performed for ancillary features and transect width
intervals were 10 meters along the centerline and 30-50 meter intervals inside the study corridor. The rate of
survey in the HPAs was about 15 acres per person per day or 1-2 miles per person per day.
Archeologists located WTG locations with Global Positioning System (GPS). Pads were conceived
of a circle measuring about 4.5 acres in size. Survey transects were performed at 20-30 meter intervals at
HPAs which included, upland stream terraces, ridge tops, historic roads, and railroads. Random pedestrian
transects to examine any cultural features encountered.
At HPAs and creek or stream crossings where trenching and new road right-of-way construction is
planned, 100 percent of the ground surface was examined within ca. 500 feet (166 meters) of channels using
pedestrian walk over and transect methodology at 20 meter intervals. Cut banks and all exposures of
subsurface soil profiles were examined for buried cultural deposits.
APC visited, but did not inspect LPAs where ground disturbance is extensive, such as, but not
limited to oil and gas fields, areas of root plowing/clearing, brush pushing, and/or land use that has
obliterated original land surfaces. Wind shield survey from vehicles was implemented for the 250-foot wide
corridor inspection of proposed new right-of-way easements located in HPAs yet to be determined.
Systematic shovel testing was not performed at the required rate of 1 per 3 acres, as needed, because
of disturbance and because surface visibility was often greater than 40 percent. Alluvial settings with the
potential for buried cultural resources were found and shovel testing was performed at those localities. No
diagnostic artifacts were collected because none was recovered from shovel testing.

Artifact Collecting and Analysis
On broken diagnostic artifact was found on the surface in a plowed field during the survey and was
left in place. No artifacts were collected for analysis or curation, as a result of shovel testing. No buried
archeological deposits or cultural horizons were observed. No intact diagnostic artifacts were observed in cut
banks.
Resource Recordation
Archeological Sites. No new archeological sites were found within the APE and therefore no new
archeological sites were recorded. An inventory of cultural resources observed outside the APE was
generated. All archeological site loci were added to project maps for avoidance.
Historic Resources. Historic buildings are present in close proximity to the transmission line ROW
outside the permanent easement. Photographs of each building were taken and spatial data collected at each
locale. General construction dates were identified for each. The architectural style and condition of each of
the structures were evaluated.

3.3. 2013 SURVEY RESULTS
INTRODUCTION
The results of the 2013 Keechi Creek Wind Farm and Transmission Line survey were positive,
additional cultural resources loci were observed inside study and survey corridors. Outside of the 2013 APE
of the wind farm, one historic site was located and outside the 2013 APE of the transmission line, two
prehistoric sites and two historic locales were observed. The 2013 survey provided new regional prehistoric
data and added historic data to the project area baseline information and showed that no significant cultural
resources will be affected by the 2013 development layout.
INSIDE THE APE
Based on the findings of the 2013, combined with the 2008 and 2011 season results; no new cultural
resources fall inside the 2013 Keechi Creek Wind Farm APE. The parts of the APE that were previously
surveyed in 2008 and 2011 and are now part of the 2013 APE do not contain cultural resources loci. The
new part of the APE added in 2013 to the 2008-2011 wind farm layout does not contain cultural resources.
The 250-foot wide corridor where the transmission line will be built is also absent of cultural resources.
Shovel testing also yielded negative results and is discussed below.
Shovel testing methodology during the 2013 survey was modified due to conditions encountered.
Ridge tops with rocky ground cover were common (Figure 33). Upland areas were covered with very
shallow soils which were not subjected to shovel testing (Figure 34 and 35). Shovel testing was not
implemented in these types of locales present in the wind farm project area and along the transmission line
ROW. Unplanted plowed fields with high surface visibility along Beans Creek, locales with high surface
visibility from new stock tank construction, extensively disturbed oil and gas locales, and areas with slopes
greater that 5 % were not shovel tested.

Although fifteen waterways were present along the transmission line route, they are mostly minor
down cutting drainages and are the heads or head waters of tributaries. Alluvial settings are absent form the
wind farm area and were not often present along the proposed ROW, even at creeks and were often limited to
one side. Instead, stony to rocky, shallow soils were observed. Alluvial soils were only encountered along
the main channel of Beans Creek (Figure 36) and on its stream terraces (Figure 37). The minor tributaries
were lined with clay sediments derived from substrata rather than loam originated from and deposited in
alluvial settings. Slopes in excess of five percent were common along upland drainages.

The major drainages crossed by the 2013 transmission line ROW are the Middle East Fork of Keechi
Creek, Upper Beans Creek, and Upper Little Beans Creek. Five of the crossings contain deep Bastsil,
Gowen, and/or Pulexas sediments derived from loamy alluvium (Huckabee et al. 1988). Based on the
presence of alluvial sediments, the five crossings were intensively surveyed and two were shovel tested due
to low surface visibility (Table 6). Two shovel tests each were dug on the west (ST1 and ST2) and east (ST3
and ST4) sides of the East Fork of Keechi Creek where surface visibility was about 30 percent due to heavy
woods and vegetation.
Along the main channel of Beans Creek, agriculture was the prevalent land use. Fields were
unplanted and provided very high visibility of mixed plow zone flood plain soils, except at one wooded
location where surface visibility was obscured by vegetation. At three localities, the ROW crosses the main
channel of the Beans Creek.
Two shovel tests (ST5 and ST6) were placed at the Beans Creek crossing where loamy soils were
present and the ground surface was obscured. The remaining two Beans Creek crossings were situated in
plowed fields with very high surface visibility and did not require shovel testing. A fourth locality situated
on the east side of a tributary of Beans Creek possessed deep alluvial soils however; it was not visited due to
the presence of previous disturbance by natural gas pipeline and utility ROWs.

OUTSIDE THE APE
During the 2013 survey, six new cultural loci were found outside the APE of the wind farm and the
transmission line (Table 7). Two of the loci are prehistoric and four are historic. Prehistoric loci consist of
archeological sites made up of lithic artifact scatters. The four historic loci area comprised of an industrial
feature, two historic buildings, and one historic barn complex. The industrial feature is late nineteenth
century in age and the buildings were constructed in the twentieth century.

In the wind farm project, one nineteenth century historic railroad grade is present near the locations
for WTG 26 and WTG 27. The grade has been bisected previously (Figure 38). A damaged culvert also
remains (Figure 39). The features are not intact and although the nineteenth century railroad may be
important to regional history, the poor condition of the features made them a non-contributing factor to the
railroad grade’s eligibility status. The railroad grade is an industrial features and an archeological site. The
location was not recorded because it falls outside the project APE.

Three historic cultural resources were observed inside the 1000 ft wide transmission line study
corridor. The first is the mid-twentieth century Tillery/Rowe farmhouse (Figure 40). The original house
appears to have been rectangular frame house built in the 1940s. It has been added on to on both the north
and south sides. Due to the modification it is not eligible for listing in the NRHP or as a SAL. The
transmission line will be in full view of the farm house, however; the affects on the historic building will not
be adverse and therefore construction can proceed without further work related to historic structures.

Figure 40. Photograph, Facing Northeast, Showing the Modified 1940s Farm House on Tillery/Rowe .

The historic property is associated with the first farm house and is a set of mid-twentieth century
sheet metal barns and pens (Figure 41). The complex is situated 69-277 feet north of the property line that
the transmission line will parallel on the north side. The transmission line alignment will be place on the
south side of the fence line inside a 250-feet wide corridor to which APC did not have access. The permanent
easement could be as much as 150 feet south of the property line and about 220 feet of the complex or as
close as 89 feet, depending on the distance from the fence. The pens are part of an operating cattle operation

and will be avoided and no cultural resources will be affected. Construction of the transmission line can
proceed without any additional archeological or historic investigation.

One historic house ruin was encountered at an HPA visited on Dutton Road (Figure 43). The
Fowler property contains a double pen house that has been added on to and is in ruin and is not an eligible
historic property. The transmission line will be in full view of the farm house and the ROW will be 70 feet
west of the double pen house, however, the affects on the historic building will not be adverse and therefore
construction can proceed without further work related to historic structures.

DISCUSSION
The 2013 studies of the Keechi Creek Wind Farm and Transmission Line locales added new data
related to area prehistoric and historic settlement patterns to that collected in 2008 and 2011. Evidence of
prehistoric activity was documented for the first time during three survey seasons and was found outside the
wind farm to the east along the transmission line ROW. One of the reasons for this result is the presence of
major creeks with reliable water sources lined with well-drained, Pulexas and Bastisil alluvial soils along the
transmission line ROW at East Keechi Creek and Beans Creek. Such settings are not present in the wind
farm locale.
Conversely, nineteenth century historic sites commonly found in the wind farm project were not
common along the transmission line route, and twentieth century house sites absent from the ranch are
present near the transmission line ROW. This is because the wind farm is located on large private ranches
established in the late nineteenth century that have not been subject to residential development. Instead, the
transmission line crosses main transportation arteries, county roads, and residential roads lined by twentieth
century commercial, industrial, and residential.
Certain localities situated at the headwaters of the East Fork Keechi Creek and Bean’s Creek can be
HPAs for prehistoric cultural resources. This fact is due to the proximity to reliable water and the presence of
well-drained alluvial soils. The uplands were also found to be HPAs for twentieth century historic house
sites. Nineteenth century historic farm sites are often associated with pioneer persons important to Jack
County local and regional history. Twentieth century farms are associated with longtime resident owners
often from one family. The fact that cultural resources are present, does not preclude development of the
wind farm. Any impacts to archeological the sites can resolved by avoidance and/or by spanning the
transmission over the locale.

3.4. SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
Wind farm development components are divided into WTG pad sites, ancillary tracts, and linear
features. Ancillary tracts are for O&M facilities, compounds, and /or substation locations. Linear
components are for access roads and cable/connect routes between WTGS and strings of WTGs. The Keechi
Creek Wind Farm components have been modified three times during project development and design since
2008. As a result, a wide spectrum of cultural resources data was gathered during three field seasons that add
to the baseline knowledge of locale and regional culture history. Throughout the studies, RES has met its
commitment and intent to avoid all cultural resources and the need for additional archeological or historical
work at the Keechi Creek Wind Farm and Transmission Line. This section summarizes the project
components and findings of the three survey efforts and provides overall project area information, project
descriptions, and conclusions and recommendations.
PROJECT AREAS
The initial project area in 2008 covered three ranches and consisted of 185 Wind Turbine Generator
(WTG) locales, two substation locales, an office and maintenance yard, a site compound, three quarries, one
transmission line right-of-way in the northeast part of the project area, and linear ancillary features. In 2011,
the project area was concentrated on two the ranches, (Hackley/Richards and Cook), while one ranch
(Cherryhomes) was eliminated. A southeast string was added in 2011 and WTGS and ancillary features
were added to the ends of existing turbine strings. Southeastern parts were removed in 2013 and will not be
built and instead, a string was added on the north. The transmission line ROW was moved from the northeast
part of the wind farm to the southeast.
PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS
The Keechi Creek Wind Farm APEs have varied slightly (Table 8). In 2008, APC estimated the total
area to be affected by construction or the APE of the Keechi Wind Farm layout would be about 518.6 acres.
The 2008 Transmission Line APE would be approximately 120 acres. APC calculated the total area to be
affected by construction of the 2011 Keechi Wind Farm layout to be about 644.8 acres. In 2013, APC
estimates the total area to be affected by construction or the APE of the 2013 Keechi Wind Farm layout will
be about 666.2 acres, not including ancillary features locales which are not known at the time of writing.
The 2008 Transmission Line APE measured about 120 acres, however; it will not be built. The 2013
Transmission Line APE will be approximately 147.6 acres. In all, the 2013 project APE, as planed in
September 2013 totals 666.2 acres in area.

PROJECT STUDY CORRIDORS
Field visits, windshield surveys, random inspections and observations yielded data inside study and
survey corridors throughout the project area. Due to these activities and because of the presence of similar
landforms, environmental settings, land uses impacts, the results of survey findings may be inferred to apply
to broad areas within the study and survey corridors (Table 9). Overall coverage for the wind farm study
corridor totals 5496.8 acres. The transmission line ROW studies covered a total of 1596 acres.
Approximately 31.1 percent or 2209 acres of the study corridors were intensively examined. In all, the 2008,
2001, and 2013 survey findings may be extrapolated to apply to an area measuring about 7092.8 acres.

PROJECT SURVEY AREAS
During the three seasons of field work about 3081.2 acres have been intensively inspected for
cultural resources by APC inside the Keechi Creek Wind Farm development (Table 10). Approximately
1170.7 acres have been covered inside the various APEs (Figure 43). Approximately 265 proposed WTG pad
sites locations (729 acres) were inspected during the three survey seasons. Locations for substations, O&M
facilities, compounds, a compressor station, quarries, and a switchyard (110 acres) were examined. A total of
20.4 miles of proposed transmission line ROW measuring from 100-1000 feet wide (1499.7 acres) were
covered. About 50.6 miles of linear features were examined (212.7 acres). Transmission line coverage in
2008 totaled 10 miles by 80 feet wide (120 acres) and in 2013 about 10.4 miles by 250-1000 feet wide
(1379.7 acres). In all, about 201.4 miles (1499.7) acres were covered for transmission lint ROWs (Figure
44).

Cultural Resources Survey

RESULTS
During the three survey seasons, extensive new data were collected for North Central Texas and Jack
County related to history and prehistory, site types, and settlement patterns. A total of 27 cultural resources
loci were observed all of which, except two, are historic in age (Figure 45). Historic sites (n=25) include 19th
century cemeteries (n=3), house sites (n=2), rock walls/pen (n=2), and rail road grades (n=3). In addition,
20th century historic buildings (n=4), a house site (n=2), a trash dump (n=1), erosion control features (n=1),
and rock wall/fence remnants (n=7) were encountered. Prehistoric sites (n=2) observed consist of an open
campsite (n=1) and an artifact scatter (n=1). Appendix III lists all cultural resources loci observed and
selected characteristics. Appendix IV contains a map with cultural resources locations outside the APE.

Figure 45. Plan Map Showing the 2013 APE and the Distribution of Cultural Resources Found Related to the
Keechi Creek Wind Farm
Of the 27 cultural loci encountered over three seasons, eight locales fall in close proximity (within
57 to 935 feet) of the 2013 Keechi Creek Wind Farm or Transmission Line APE (Table 11). Three loci are in
the wind farm project area and five loci fall alongside the transmission line ROW (Figure 46). Archeological
Site 41JA40 is 243 feet north east of WTG 21. A segment of a nineteenth century rail road grade and a
culvert remnant are present about 290 feet east of the locations for WTG 26 and WTG 27. A segment of a
rock wall is 630 feet west of a planned access road. A complex of mid-twentieth century barns and pens may

be as close as 69 feet north of the proposed Transmission Line ROW. The developer agrees to avoid all loci
and leave the preserved in place because they fall outside the APE.

DISCUSSION
Through systematic field inspection by qualified personnel familiar with the region, long-term
consultation, and voluntary planning, RES, via its representatives APC, HDR, and URS has demonstrated
that no significant cultural resources or historic properties will be affected by the construction of the Keechi
Creek Wind Farm and its ancillary features. The development of the Keechi Creek Wind Farm has provided
a unique opportunity to perform a long-term, focused cultural resources study of an extensive amount of
contiguous acreage in North Central Texas archeological region.
Evidence of Prehistoric through Historic time periods fitting established chronologies was
documented in the project area. Very sparse, highly localized prehistoric activity at open camp sites on
alluvial terraces occurred along the floodplain of Upper Beans Creek. However, the upper drainages of Lost
Creek, East Keechi Creek, and West Keechi Creek situated in the project area do not contain evidence of
prehistoric activity. This fact is probably because the upper parts of drainages contain less reliable water flow
than downstream locations.
The presence of nearby Fort Richardson influenced early pioneers to come to the area and allowed
the Hensley and Henderson families to settle on the Richards Ranch, as early as 1860. After closure of the
fort and the westward movement of the frontier, historic settlement remained sparse into the early twentieth
century. The frequency of cultural loci increased by one and one half times in the project area, as the
population increased and a sustainable ranching and farming economy developed. Twentieth century land
use continued to be ranching, and the economy grew to include oil and gas production and recreational
hunting and is reflected in the type and kind of cultural resources documented during the survey.

3.5 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CONCLUSIONS
Construction of the 2013 RES Keechi Creek Wind Farm and Transmission Line will not affect any
cultural resources eligible or potentially eligible for listing in the NRHP and or as SAL and can proceed, as
planned. The twenty six cultural resources observed are not located in areas where the new construction will
occur and will not be directly affected.
Historic properties are present in proximity to the 2013 transmission line ROW. The transmission
line will indirectly affect them by being visible from the resource. The historic properties, however; are
ineligible for listing in the NRHP because they are not architecturally or historically significant, and
therefore, the indirect affect to the properties will not be adverse.
The Keechi Creek Wind Farm and Transmission Line layout, as planned in September of 2013,
avoids impacts to all cultural resources and therefore, no further investigation prior to construction is
required. For these reasons, the development may proceed. In addition, new construction may be placed
inside any of the study corridors examined to date, except where cultural resources loci are present.
In terms of research, the cultural resources surveys yielded new baseline data about the prehistory of
the area and the presence of Native Americans on Upper Beans Creek was collected. The findings also
resulted in the collection of new twentieth century historic property data for central Jack County. Survey
results show that area settlement followed established regional chronologies. Human occupation in North
Central Texas began in the Prehistoric period and slowly, but steadily continued and spread through the
Historic period. Frequency, distribution, and location data gathered reflect known regional settlement
patterns.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Construction, as planned in September 2013, for the Keechi Creek Wind Farm and Transmission
Line can proceed inside areas inspected for cultural resources in 2008, 2011, and 2013 with no additional
archeological investigation and with two routine conditions. First, if design plans should change before or
during construction, the new locations should be examined for the presence of cultural resources. Lastly, it is
recommended that if cultural resources are uncovered during construction, work should stop and APC should
be notified by telephone at (512) 398-2946. Activity should cease at the location until the find is evaluated
by APC in consultation with the THC.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE 41JA23
Note: Site 41JA23 was recorded in 2008, because it fell inside the 2008 APE. However, the 2008
layout was not built. Site JA23 falls well outside the 2013 Keechi Creek Wind Farm APE and will not be
affected.
Archeological Site 41JA23 is an upland house site that is early twentieth century in age. It is the
homestead of the Cherryhomes family (Figure 46). It is located on a level ridge top overlooking the Snake
Creek Valley to the west. The site consists of three native stone features. The family removed the house, and
left the chimney standing. Besides the chimney (Figure 47), the features consist of a sandstone-lined cistern
(Figure 48), a vented sandstone-lined cellar (Figure 49), and a modern concrete pad. Stock pens and a
Quonset hut/barn are nearby, but are not part of the historic site, and are actively being used as part of ranch
operations.
Archeological Site 41JA23 sits at elevation 1371 feet above mean sea level (ft amsl). It is rectangular
and measures 30 ft north-to-south by 40 ft east-to-west and 1200 square feet in area. Snake Creek is 1.2 km
to the west. Soils consist of shallow brown (7.5YR) loam from the Bonti Fine Loam association. Shovel
testing was not necessary at the site, because surface visibility was 75 per cent. Artifacts were not found,
landowners report that they were collected and/or removed from the lot.
The research value of the Cherryhomes House Site is high related to local and Jack County history.
Members of the Cherryhomes family were early ranchers in the area and the locale contains features that
contribute to the knowledge of local and Jack County history. For that reason, the Cherryhomes House Site is

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE 41JA24
Note: Site 41JA24 was recorded in 2008, because it fell inside the 2008 APE for the transmission line ROW.
However, the 2008 layout was not built. Site 41JA24 falls well outside the 2013 APE.
Archeological Site 41JA24 is an upland trash dump that is early twentieth century in age (Figure 50).
It may be affiliated with Archeological Site 41JA23, the Cherryhomes family house site. Site 41JA24 is
located in a gully overlooking the Snake Creek to the west. The site consists of house hold refuse, including
crockery, white ware ceramic, brown bottle glass, cast iron stove grates, #3 wash tubs, applied neck bottles,
and a strap hinge (Figure 51).
Site 41JA24 sits at elevation 1140 ft amsl. It is roughly 20 feet in diameter and it is partially buried
and is eroding out into the gully. The depth of the exposed deposits is 8 inches below the surface. Snake
Creek is 60 feet north of the dump. Soils consist of shallow dark brown (7.5YR4/6) loam from the Bosque
Clay Loam, occasionally flooded, association. Shovel testing was not necessary at the site, because surface
visibility was 75 per cent. The research value of the trash dump is low related to local and Jack County
history. The site is not judged to be eligible, and merits no further work. Archeological Site 41JA24 is in the
proposed transmission line easement and it will be spanned and avoided.

ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE 41JA40
Note: Site 41JA40 was recorded in 2011, because it is adjacent to features of the 2011 wind farm APE. The
2011 layout is the same as the 2013 layout. Site 41JA40 falls adjacent to a proposed access road and cabling
route, both of which were designed to avoid the locale in 2013. The site locale, therefore, will not be
affected.
Site 41JA40 is an early twentieth century residential house site locale made up of early twentieth
century features (Figure 52). The site is about 2 acres in size consists of five above-the-ground features. It
consists of a square cement house foundation (Figure 53), three native stone rock pens (Figure 54), a rocklined cellar (?) depression, two wire pens, and a covered water well(?) associated with twentieth century
artifacts. The features are representative of local construction and ranch use in practice since the nineteenth
century. The features at Site 41JA40 are intact and have not been pushed or had rocks removed.
. It is situated at elevation 1270 ft amsl on a low hill top overlooking the headwaters of Lost Creek
ca. 1 kilometer to the east. Soils are shallow pale brown (Munsell 7.5 YR) silts. Blue Grove Loam, 1 to 3 per
cent slopes, covers the site. Vegetation consists of mature mesquite forest with short grasses and cacti
Shovel testing results were positive; of four shovel tests dug, two pieces of clear glass were found in
Shovel Tests 1 and 2 in level one (0-20cm below the surface). Materials observed on the surface include
yellow fire brick fragments, whole clear bottles, and a galvanized wash basin. All artifacts are early to midtwentieth century in age.
Eligibility Status
The overall research value of Site 41JA40 related to Jack County history and settlement is low due to
its twentieth century age and the presence of shallow, sparse subsurface deposits. However, the research
value of the intact early twentieth century features is judged to be slightly higher and set at medium to high
related to early twentieth century ranch history. Despite the medium to high research value related to modern
history, Site 41JA40 is judged not to be eligible for listing in the NRHP and/or as a SAL. No further work is
needed at Site 41JA40 related to the wind farm development. Any future archeological work at Site 41JA40
should include oral history and historic research.

Potential Impacts
Site 41JA40 is located inside a portion of the 1000-foot wide corridor between WTGs 52 and 41
where roads and trenches will be placed. It sits ca 300 feet west of an existing unimproved ranch road that
will be used as an access road to the northernmost turbine string. Widening the existing road will not impact
the locale. Routing roads and connects to the west of the locale would also eliminate any impacts to the site.
