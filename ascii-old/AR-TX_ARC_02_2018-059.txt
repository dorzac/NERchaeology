ABSTRACT
The City of Fort Worth is proposing to build a multi-use city park with multiple
sport fields in southern Denton County, Texas. Freese and Nichols, Inc., contracted
with AR Consultants, Inc. to conduct an intensive archaeological survey of the
Alliance Park Phase I & II Design project area. The Alliance Park project area totals
78.7 acres and is broken into four land-use segments. The Texas Historical
Commission recognized that significant disturbance had previously occurred in two
of these segments and did not require archaeological survey. Thus, the Alliance
Park survey area consists of two land-use segments that total approximately 53.4
acres. In total, 27 shovel tests were excavated within the survey area during the
systematic field inspection on December 12 and 17, 2018. The archaeological
potential for prehistoric and historic cultural resources had been considered low.
During survey, no cultural resources were identified in the shovel tests or found on
the surface. Given the results of this survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that
further cultural resource investigations are unnecessary for this project, and
requests that the Texas Historical Commission and the Fort Worth District of the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers concur with this recommendation. The field notes,
photographs, and photo logs are curated at the Center for Archaeological Studies at
Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Fort Worth is planning the construction of a multi-use city park with multiple sport
fields, in Denton County, Texas (Figure 1). The Alliance Park Phase I & II Design project area is
divided into four land-use segments (segments 1-4) and totals approximately 78.7 acres (Figure
2). The Texas Historical Commission (THC) recognized that significant disturbance had
previously occurred in segments 1 and 2 in the past and did not require archaeological survey.
Therefore, survey was only conducted in segments 3 and 4. The total acreage for the Alliance Park
survey area was 53.4 acres. The proposed maximum vertical excavation and disturbance in these
two segments of the survey area will be between 1 and 5 ft.
The survey area is approximately 53.4 acres in size and is located immediately south of Litsey
Road and east of Elizabethtown Cemetery Road in southern Denton County, Texas. The Alliance
Park project area rests in the floodplain of Henrietta Creek, that ranges in distance from 30 m to
120 m to the east. Based on historic aerial imagery, it appears that at least half of the project area
has been subject to farming for no less than the past 65 years.
Freese and Nichols, Inc., who is handling the environmental permitting for the project, contracted
with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct an intensive archaeological survey of the Alliance
Park survey area. The purpose of this survey was to determine if cultural resources were present
within the survey area and, if so, to make recommendations about their significance and how they
might be impacted by construction. The survey involved walking transects and placing shovel tests
across the survey area.
Fieldwork was conducted on December 12 and 17, 2018. This report was prepared to be reviewed
by the Texas Historical Commission and the Fort Worth District of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE). Relevant legislation includes the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural
Resource Code, Title 9, Chapter 191). Federal legislation includes the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National Environmental Policy Act of
1969 (PL-90-190), the Clean Water Act, as amended (PL-92-500), the Rivers and Harbors Act of
1899, the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291),
Executive Order No. 11593 âProtection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment,â and
Protection of Historic Properties (36 CFR 800).
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of the
THC (Council of Texas Archeologists 2018). The following report presents a brief description of
the natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and previous
investigations within the study area. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed
in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes
with recommendations followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area falls within the Grand Prairie subdivision of the Cross Timbers Ecoregion of
Texas (Griffith et al. 2007). The topography of the landscape is undulating, and the project area
lies in a transitional area between the wetter climate of East Texas and the dry climate of the Great
Plains. The ecology consists of tallgrass prairie in the upland areas and elm (Ulmus spp.), pecan
(Carya illinoensis), hackberry (Celtis spp.), ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) and, to a lesser extent,
honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) in riparian areas where deeper soils have developed.
The proposed survey area is mapped on Quaternary Alluvium (Bureau of Economic Geology
1991). This formation consists of alluvial sand, silt, clay, and gravel of variable thickness on low
terrace deposits along streams.
The proposed park is mapped on four soil series that correspond to the Henrietta Creek floodplain:
Frio silty clay frequently flooded, Trinity clay, Ponder loam, and Lewisville clay loam (Ford and
Pauls 1980:Sheet 44). Frio silty clay frequently flooded underlies the eastern half of the proposed
survey area. This alluvial soil consists of 102 cm of a very dark grayish brown to dark grayish
brown silty clay to silty clay loam A horizon on top of a grayish brown B horizon (Ford and Pauls
1980:66). The western half of the survey area is underlain by Trinity clay which consist of 41 cm
of very dark gray clay A horizon on top of a very dark gray clay B horizon (Ford and Pauls
1980:79). In the northern and northeastern section, Ponder loam consists of an 18 cm of a dark
grayish brown clay loam A horizon above a brown clay B horizon (Ford and Pauls 1980:74). In
the very northern portion of the survey area is the Lewisville clay loam on 1 to 3 percent slopes.
These soils, typically found along stream terraces, consist of up to 41 cm of a dark grayish brown
clay A horizon underlain by a grayish brown silty clay B horizon (Ford and Pauls 1980:70)

CULTURAL HISTORY
A prehistoric chronology, based on Prikryl (1990), with an added historic period, for North Central
Texas is presented in Table 1 to provide the reader with a temporal framework for the culture
history of the region.

ca. 11000 BC-6000 BC
The Paleoindian period is characterized as having small, nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers whose
primary emphasis was the exploitation of now-extinct megafauna, such as mammoth and bison.
Smaller game and plant gathering likely supplemented the Paleoindian diet (Meltzer and Bever
1995:59). As such, the archaeological record for the region consists of several distinctive styles of
projectile points, such as the Clovis, Plainview, and Folsom. Currently, four Clovis points have
been reported from Denton County, and numerous have been found in surrounding counties (Bever
and Meltzer 2007:67-70). Subsistence patterns began to change as a general drying climatic trend
swept the region, leading to extinction of many of the areaâs large mammals toward the end of the
Paleoindian period.
The Archaic period is characterized by increased alluviation of water channels and a generally
wetter environment than the previous period. This change in climate resulted in modification of
Native American subsistence patterns, with broad exploitation of bottomland food resources. This,
in turn, resulted in clusters of seasonal settlements along large drainages, including the Trinity
River and its various forks and tributaries, and a marked increase in population density. With the
advent of repeated, seasonal occupation of sites along drainages came a perceived increase in
territorial constrictions among different groups in the region, with several authors citing the limited
use of regional lithic resources as evidence of this trend (Prewitt 1983; Skinner 1981).
The Late Prehistoric period is interpreted as a dryer period, with a focus on procurement of faunal
resources, agriculture, and food preservation. The appearance of pottery and the bow and arrow
help date artifact assemblages to this period (Shafer 1977). The Protohistoric period is
characterized by Native American abandonment of North Central Texas in the period around
1500/1600, with almost no archaeological evidence found in the region dating to this time (Skinner
1988).
The Historic European period saw widespread Anglo settlement of North Central Texas beginning
in the 1830s. This expansion often resulted in brutal conflicts between settlers and nomadic bands
of Native Americans (Garrett 1972:24). These early conflicts gave way to various Anglo strategies

aimed at cohabitation, including peace treaties signed as early as 1843. Eventually, the entirety of
North Central Texas was settled, with numerous Anglo military installations established in the
region. After Texas became part of the United States in 1845, peace was short lived. The Civil
War took its toll on the North Central Texas population, as most of the able-bodied men left to
fight for the Confederacy.
The first established European settlement in Denton County began before the mid-1800s with the
establishment of the Peterâs Colony after Texas independence. These early settlers were farmers
who farmed in the bottomland along the Elm Fork of the Trinity (Bridges 1978). There is very
little evidence of historic-era Native American occupation anywhere in Dallas or Denton County,
although historic accounts indicate that groups were present in the early 1800s. Beginning in the
1830s and continuing into the 1840s, the aboriginal inhabitants continued to play a role in the
regional history. Garrett (1972:24) states, âIndian hostilities almost depopulated North Texas (of
Anglo dwellers) after 1839. It dwindled to less than half.â Hostilities continued until the Republic
of Texas and ten Native American tribes signed the Treaty of 1843. This treaty provided the
impetus for settlement of several North Central Texas counties.
Commercial farming was not important until after the Civil War, and the early settlers were
essentially self-sufficient. Besides domestic plants and animals, wild animals and native plants
were commonly consumed. Denton became the county seat in 1856. By 1875, cotton, corn, and
wheat were the main cash crops. Up to half of these crops were grown by tenant farmers who either
paid rent to the land owner for their house, tools, and seed or by tenants who gave the landowner
a third of the grain and a quarter of the cotton or other cash crops. By the turn of the century, all
the major communities had been established and some had passed away (Odom 2016).
Previous Investigations
A search of TASA (2018) revealed no National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties,
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), cemeteries, historical markers, previously recorded
archaeological sites, or cultural resources surveys within the proposed project area. However, one
cemetery and its associated historical marker, and five cultural resource surveys were found within
a mile of the project area.
Within 1-mi of the project area the Elizabeth or Elizabethtown Cemetery and its associated
historical marker are located to the north. In addition, five archaeological surveys were conducted.
Two were conducted to the west; one in 2007 for the Federal Highway Administration by the
Lopez Garcia Group and the second in 2015 for the Texas Department of Transportation by Hicks
& Company. In 2012, Halff Associates, Inc. conducted a survey for the Trinity River Authority to
the south. No sites were recorded. Finally, In 2009 and 2012 ARC surveyed sections of Henrietta
and Elizabeth Creek for the Henrietta Relief Interceptor, HC-1, Pipeline Route and the 25HC-1
Henrietta Creek Relief Interceptor Pipeline Route Survey. These pedestrian surveys included
shovel tests and backhoe trenching, no cultural resources were identified.
Historic Map & Aerial Review
In addition to the TASA survey, several historic maps and aerial photographs were reviewed prior
to field work. No structures are shown in the proposed project area on the 1918 Denton County

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Two predictions were developed prior to survey regarding the potential for finding prehistoric and
historic sites in the Alliance Park survey area. The first hypothesis concerns the prehistoric
occupation. It was predicted that there was low potential for encountering evidence of prehistoric
occupation in this location. This is based primarily on the fact that the survey area lies along
Henrietta Creek, and in its floodplain, where no archaeological sites have been recorded. The main
concentration of prehistoric archaeological sites being within the Denton Creek Watershed located
much further downstream along the main creek channel. It has been suggested by Coleman and
Shelton (2012) and Shelton et al. (2009) that the low potential for prehistoric archaeological sites
within this and similar drainages nearby may be attributed to the narrow floodplains of the
intermittent Henrietta and Elizabeth creeks. Coleman and Shelton (2012) predict that any
prehistoric sites in this area of Henrietta Creek and similar drainages are likely ephemeral and are
possibly located on Quaternary terraces or on knolls in the floodplain that do not occur in the
survey area.
The second prediction addresses historic site potential which is also considered to be low based on
a review of historic maps and aerial photographs of the surrounding area which show no
development or structures in the project area. Moreover, the historic aerial photograph review
indicates that the area was farmed and plowed for at least the past 65 years. However, historic trash
scatters may be located along drainages.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (2014). Field
personnel walked the entire tract in transects no wider than 30 m. Shovel tests (STs) were
excavated throughout the project area averaging one per two acres, where the slope was less than
20 percent and the ground visibility less than 30 percent to explore for the presence of buried
cultural deposits. Per standard procedures, STs were excavated into the subsoil, or the depth
reachable by a bucket auger. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. An auger was used starting
between 50 and 60 centimeters below surface (cmbs) to supplement the STs to depths of at least
100 cmbs or until subsoil was encountered. While an auger bucket is only 9.5 cm in diameter, the
ability to test deposits that may be buried deeper than a shovel can reach is important in floodplain
settings. In addition, any buried cultural material or features such as lithic scatters or shell middens
would be visible while auguring. All loamy soils were screened through Â¼â wire mesh screens.
The clay fill was inspected visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural
materials were present. ST soil matrices were described on the basis of composition, texture, and
color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart (2009) was used to identify soil colors. Field personnel made
notes about the ground exposure, drainages, soil types, and disturbed areas where subsoil was
exposed. Photographs were taken during the survey using a 16-megapixel, GPS-equipped, digital
camera. ST and project boundary locations were marked with a handheld GPS receiver using the
NAD83 datum.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections. The first describes the project areaâs natural setting along
with results of the pedestrian survey. Shovel tests (STs) are described generally throughout the
text but are detailed in Table 2 at the end of the Survey Results section. Conclusions round out the
chapter.
Survey Results
Survey began in the northeastern section of the survey area on east-west transects. The northern,
wooded, section consists of grasses, mesquite, and Bois dâ Arc trees. Ground visibility in this area
was zero percent due to grass cover and leaf litter (Figure 4). Survey continued to the south where
a farmed field was encountered. Based on historic aerial photographs, this southern section has
been farmed and plowed for at least the last 65 years. Ground visibility was approximately 50% in
this area with cut corn stalks, cobs, and plant material comprising the other 50% (Figure 5). Four
soil types (Trinity clay, Frio silty clay, Ponder loam, and Lewisville clay loam) are mapped in the
survey area and dictated the depths for shovel testing and augering. The B horizon subsoil of the
Trinity clay series is mapped in this area at a depth of 41 cmbs. As there is no visual or textural
difference between the A and B horizon clays, STs in this area were excavated to at least 60 cmbs
to ensure that the subsoil was reached. In the other three soil series, STs were excavated to the
subsoil which was a markedly lighter colored B horizon. For the Frio silty clay series, the B horizon
is mapped at 102 cmbs and an auger was started between 55 to 60 cmbs to reach subsoil. In general,
the soil profiles revealed in the STs were consistent with those mapped in the Alliance Park survey
area with Trinity clays in the western half, Frio silty clays in the eastern half, and Ponder loam and
Lewisville clay loam in the very northern portion (Figure 6).
In total, 27 STs were excavated within the Alliance Park survey area. All the shovel tests were
negative, and no cultural resources were encountered on the surface. Shovel tests were not
randomly excavated across the survey area (Figure 6). Much of the survey area is in a low area
and the floodplain of Henrietta Creek. However, near the southeastern corner of the survey area
there is a small high point or knoll that offers the only relief in the immediate vicinity (Figure 7
and Figure 1), and thus, held the highest predicted potential for containing prehistoric material.
Immediately inside the survey area at this location a gas pipeline and a salt water pipeline run
parallel to the eastern survey boundary closest to the knoll. Although outside the Alliance Park
survey area, STs were placed immediately off the disturbed pipeline area to test for prehistoric
cultural resources that might have been eroding from the knoll. In the rest of the survey area STs
were disturbed more evenly to test for any buried cultural resources. During survey, standing water
was encountered across the survey area (Figure 8) and is visible in the farmed area on aerial
photographs (Figure 6). It appears that in the southern plowed section these areas of standing water
potentially represent a remnant channel of Henrietta Creek. This notion is supported by ST 20,
located in one of these areas between pools of standing water, that encountered creek gravels at a
depth of 14 to 28 cmbs.

Conclusions
No prehistoric or historic archaeological sites, features, or artifacts were identified during the
Alliance Park survey, as was predicted in the Research Design. Previous investigations show that
prehistoric sites have not been recorded in surveyed areas surrounding the proposed Alliance Park
project location on Henrietta Creek. The main concentration of prehistoric sites within the Denton
Creek Watershed is located much further downstream along the main creek channel. In addition,
historic aerial imagery shows that the project area has been subject to farming for at least the past
65 years.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE ALLIANCE PARK PHASE I & II DESIGN

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present
within the Alliance Park survey area in Denton County, Texas. No cultural resources were
identified on or below the surface during the survey. Based on the results of the survey, ARC
concludes that further cultural resource investigations for this project are unwarranted and
recommends that the THC and USACE concur with this assessment. However, if buried cultural
materials are discovered during construction, the THC and the Fort Worth District of the USACE
should be notified.
