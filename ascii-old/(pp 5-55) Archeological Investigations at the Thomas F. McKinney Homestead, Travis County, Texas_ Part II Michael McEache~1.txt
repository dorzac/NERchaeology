ABSTRACT
The Thomas F. McKinney homestead and mill complex represents an upper class Anglo rural
occupation dating after the Texas Republic Period (1850’s) with subsequent occupation by rural
blacks. Pedestrian survey, archeological prospecting, and excavation by the Texas Archeological
Society Field School and Texas Parks and Wildlife personnel defined prehistoric occupations and
historic structures along with background, historical, and environmental data. Some prospecting
techniques revealed probable additional archeological features. Survey and excavation data
helped minimize site damage during development of McKinney Falls State Park.

MILL
We are pleased to hear that the Hon. Thomas F. McKinney has erected an elegant
flouring mill on Onion Creek, about four miles from the city, and is prepared to
manufacture flour of a superior quality. Among all the wants of this rich country,
none has been felt so seriously as that now supplied by the enterprise of Mr.
McKinney. Up to the present time, all the flour used in Western Texas has been
imported from the North, creating an immense drain upon the cash resources of
the country. We hope now to see this drawback arrested, in giving ample encouragement to the public spirited efforts of Mr. McKinney to supply among us an
all-important improvement. In no country can better wheat be grown than in ours,
and it is a burning reproach to us to longer rely upon imported flour for our daily
bread (Texas State Gazette, July 10, 1852:3).

Research Design
Excavations at the mill were designed to "trace the walls of the structure . . . [to] determine whether the mill is of the turbine type and the direc~
tion of the outlet tunnel" (Ralph and McEachern, 1974:4). TAS excavated 69
units, mostly I x 1 m squares, at various locations around the mill. The main
emphasis was on the machine room just south of the wheel pit where details
of walls and machinery installation were noted. Excavations in the wheel pit
were aborted when time and depth became a problem. Subsequent excavation by Parks and Wildlife Department personnel (September and October,
1974) exposed the mill turbine and defined the tailrace to a certain extent.
Data concerning these excavations, artifacts, and architectural notes are presented in this report as they complement the research design.

Excava~ons
An expandable metric grid pattern was established, oriented parallel to the
main wall lines. The east west grid lines were labeled A, B, etc., starting in the
south with A. The north south grid lines were labeled 1, 2, etc., starting in the
west with 1. Units were identified by their southeast corner; thus, Unit A1 was
located in the extreme southwest corner and Unit T26 in the northeast corner.
Elevations were taken from Texas Parks and Wildlife Department monuments and converted into meters.
Brush was cleared away from the interior of all obvious wall lines. Units
selected for excavation were swept clean; recovered artifacts were labeled
surface and plotted on level records. Units were carefully troweled in 10 cm
levels. Level I is 1-10 cm below surface and Level II is 10-20 cm below surface. Excavated matrix was passed through 1/4 in mesh hardware cloth; all
artifacts and faunal remains were saved.
Thirty nine units were excavated in the machine room and eight in the
north room. Nine shallow units were placed at strategic points, such as wall
corners and pier foundations, to trace structural details.
A wooden bridge was constructed across the wheel pit around the mill shaft
to prevent it from shifting as the excavation proceeded. Four low artifact yield
units were excavated in the wheel pit, but little was learned of the nature of the
feature. The units were left open at the request of the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department and work was resumed (September, 1974) by Parks and Wildlife
personnel.
The later work by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department utilized the
TAS grid system and reference points. One large unit was opened, rather
than the standard 1 m units used by TAS. Matrix was not screened due to
budget constraints and a more than adequate TAS sample.
In excavating the wheel pit, all fill was removed and all in situ artifacts
accurately plotted. Fill was placed in a large heavy duty garbage can and lifted
using a nylon climbing rope, a rescue pulley, and a front end loader. The can
was hand dumped into the front end loader bucket and removed to a backdirt
pile. Mapping was facilitated by dropping plumbs at I m intervals and triangufating from these points. Line levels provided vertical control from transit
surveyed datum points.
Each artifact was bagged separately or by lot and its provenience noted.
Each artifact in a lot had a discrete provenience and no two artifacts in any lot
were similar. Although it was possible to keep the specimens separate, the
system proved difficult to use in the laboratory and is not recommended.
Heavy pick work on the fallen building stone complicated control and often
endangered the workers.
Deposit
The machine room fill varies from sandy loam to clayey silt which was very
hard when dry and turned dark gumbo when wet. Metal and glass artifacts
were interspersed with rock rubble and displaced building stone. The deposit
changed to mostly limestone rubble and mortar as excavation proceeded into
the lower levels. Ant burrows and roots of a large persimmon tree disturbed

McEachern and Ralph - McKinney Homestead

the northeastern portions of the room.
Excavations into the millrace deposit beneath the stone arch (L16) encountered a loose black sediment with many roots and a few small rocks. At the 1020 cm level, mortar and limestone were mixed with window glass artifacts.
Deposits of sterile yellow sediment were in the southeast corner of the north
room (016). This deposit is possibly water washed materials from flood or
erosion later buried by wall collapse.
Fill in the wheel pit consisted of stratified layers of black clayey gumbo and
medium to coarse yellow sands. The upper fill slopes from the walls toward
the wheel on a fairly gentle grade. It appears that alternating floods washed in
different segregated materials. Rough faced limestone blocks, 5-25 kg each,
lie haphazardly throughout the fill. Mortar mixed with metal and glass artifacts
appear washed in, since a discernible pattern could not be noted until reaching the turbine at the bottom of the excavation. A hole 3.7 m by about 1.5 m
and almost 4 m deep (about 20 m3) was excavated down to the water table
(an elevation of 143 m). Enough of the turbine could be exposed in the
allowed time to show how the system worked. Another 0.5 m or so of fill still
lies underwater and could not be excavated without using a pump.
Architecture
McKinney’s mill (41TV289) sits on a flat expanse of exhumed beach berm
of McKown limestone (Fig. 1). The remains of the mill are a low foundation of
hand faced rock consisting of several rooms. These rooms almost completely
surround a rectangular hole 6 x 9 m and 1.5 m deep with a protruding iron
shaft.
The mill consists of many components: the millpond, race, forebay, wheel
pit, tailrace, and main superstructure which housed the installed machinery
(Fig. 2).
MILLPOND
A dam was constructed to divert water about 130 m upstream from the mill
and just above the upper edge of the falls. The importance of proper dam
construction is stressed by Hughes (1850:135): "In the first place a good
foundation is necessary to protect the dam from breaks and accidents by the
burrowing of musk rats, which occasion the destruction of so many mill
dams." Notches 30 cm wide were cut into the limestone bedrock to secure
the ends of the dam. Between the notches, a series of holes was drilled into
the bedrock and steel rods were inserted. These rods are what remains of the
dam structure. The dam probably was constructed of cypress wood with timber ends placed in the notches and secured to the iron rods.
The pooled water above the falls is normally at 145.92 m elevation. The
top of the highest iron stake is 146.76 m and the top of the forebay is
147.97 m. The dam was, therefore, greater than 1 m but less than 2 m high.
This height probably was too deep for fording by wagon. Reconstruction of
the millpond (McEachern and Ralph, 1980:16) shows the water level at
147.5 m, which would make the dam 1.58 m high and 0.74 m above the
tallest iron stake. A wing dam of the same iron rod construction on the east
bank diverted the water into the millrace.

MILLRACE
The millrace delivers water from the millpond to the forebay. The race at
McKinney’s mill, which was 108 m long and about 3.5 m wide, utilized a
natural channel in the bedrock. The north side of the millrace was formed by
the north bank of the stream. At least part, if not all, of the stream bank is
faced with rock. The south side of the race was formed in part by the wing
dam and in part by natural bedrock. Remnants of two rock pillars 11 m upstream from the forebay and in line with the wing dam may have been part of
a water gate which was used to divert water away from the mill and regulate
water level.
FOREBAY
Water from the millrace passed under a stone arch (part of the west wall of
the mill proper) and into the forebay, a large reservoir about 6 x 2.5 m and
deeper than 5 m. The forebay was constructed by quarrying a roughly square
6 x 6 m hole deeper than 5 m through a bed of McKown limestone and into
the soft pyroclastic member below. The rock excavated from the hole was
identical in appearance to rock used to construct an east west trending wall
70 cm thick across the center of the hole dividing it into two sections. The
northern section formed the forebay which created the head of water pressure
used to turn the wheel.
A hole ca 50 x 50 cm near the base of the wall allowed water under
pressure to flow into the penstock. A water gate on the forebay side of the wall
normally was used to control water flow. Two niches 20 x 20 cm and 68 cm
apart (center to center) in the cross wall between the forebay and wheel pit
and directly above the penstock are assumed to have anchored the mechanism for opening and closing the water gate. Two additional niches, similar to
those for the water gate control, were found 1.75 m east in the cross wall and
may indicate a second water gate, penstock, and waterwheel (Fig 3.)
WHEEL PIT
The wheel pit housed the penstock and water wheel and was located south
of the forebay (Fig 4.). Dimensions are approximately the same as those of
the forebay. A wall is present on the west side of the wheel pit. The wall
extends upward from the lowest point reached in excavation to the base of the
McKown limestone. The purpose of the wall apparently was to prevent the
soft pyroclastic rock from eroding.
Water entered the wheel pit through an aperture near the base of the cross
wall and was directed to the waterwheel by the penstock. The penstock was a
50 x 50 cm sq chute made of cypress and held together by a metal band or
collar. The penstock sloped down 30 cm along its length and directed the
stream of water to the side of the wheel.
The wheel laid horizontally with the vertical shaft extending from the center. The wheel was 1.3 m in diameter with a metal rim running around the
edge of it. Ten bolts protruded from the top of the exposed portion of the
wheel. They probably held a wooden disk in place over the top of the wheel.

The buckets or blades on the wheel were curved and directed the water
inward to the center of the wheel,
A circular wood collar 40 cm in diameter surrounded the metal shaft and
extended downward onto the top of the wheel. It apparently rested on a
metal plate. The top of the collar was 1.4 m above the top of the wheel and
had two octagonal metal bands running around it. The collar may have functioned as a bearing. A metal rod extended from the collar and may have been
a type of adjusting lever.
TAILRACE
Water discharged from the center of the wheel flowed 15-20 m through a
tunnel and back into Onion Creek. The roof of the tunnel was approximately
3 m above the level of the water in the wheel pit. The width of the tunnel was
not determined.
SUPERSTRUCTURE
The superstructure of the mill is divided into four parts. The main mill,
which in part straddles the forebay/wheel pit, has three rooms: the south
room or machine room; the middle room which is directly above the forebay/
wheel pit; and the north room just up slope. The southeast foundations, the
northwest foundations or east west running wall, and the piers or foundations
to the west form the other parts (Fig. 2).
South Room

The machine room has the largest variety of architectural features found at
the mill. The room measures 7.5 m east west and 3.2 m north south. Several
large saw cut stone blocks are arranged to receive large machines. Anchor
bolts and stud holes are arranged in the eastern third of the room. A wooden
door lintel and plastered walkway suggest an entrance in the north corner of
the east wall. The western part of the room is rubble filled and has a pier
toward the northwest corner. It probably was floored to the height of the large
blocks, but flooring is not evident. The bolt pattern is southeast of the turbine
but directly south of where the projected second wheel would be located.
Middle Room
The middle room is 6.4 m north south by 9.2 m east west. Large niches in
the north and south walls indicate a floor sitting on heavy beams at ca
148.5 m elevation. The beams, running north south, were at least 19 x
33 cm and probably supported in the middle.
North Room
The north room measures 4.4 m north south and 5.3 m east west. The
northern two corners are well defined, but the east wall was never connected.
It is possible that this area may represent a dock or loading area.
Southeast Foundations
Foundations extending east from the machine room indicate another room
perhaps 5 m east west and 4-5 m north south. Work was not done in this area

McEachern and Ralph - McKinney Homestead

other than clearing brush along the south wall for mapping purposes. The
northern half of the room still is covered by rock rubble.
Northwest Foundations
A faintly traced wall is an extension of the east west wall between the middle
and north rooms of the mill. Foundations were not noted north of this wall. It
is believed that the wall represents a stone retainer used to keep slope wash
out of the millrace. The wall is 12.8 m long.
West Piers or Foundations

Two foundations buttress the west wall of the machine room and four pairs
of evenly spaced piers extend west to a point due south of the northwest
foundation ending point. A lone pier is located another meter west and
slightly south of the westernmost pair. The function of these piers is unknown,
but they may have been part of a long raised shed. The shed may have
housed a sawmill, storehouse, or any type of mill related machinery. Mill
power could have been easily brought into this area.

Very little faunal material was recovered from the mill excavation. Only
four species were identified: Trionyx (softshell turtle), Didelphis marsupialis
(opossum), Sylvilagus (cottontail), and Sus scrofa (domestic pig). With the
exception of a tooth from S. scrofa, identified remains are from native species
(Table 1).

Mill Artifacts
Mill excavation produced 1,461 artifacts including specimens of ceramic,
glass, metal, and miscellaneous materials. Only 12 ceramic sherds and three
lithic artifacts were recovered. The metal artifacts are represented by fasteners
(nails, spikes, pins, bolts, nuts, etc.), a few tools, and miscellaneous identified
and unidentified specimens. Classification is first by material and then by
function.

CERAMICS
Only 12 ceramic sherds were recovered from the mill excavation. Sherds
are from whitewares with a relatively hard white paste and clear glaze. Decoration includes repousse edge, monochromatic transfer printed, and hand
painted underglaze. The ceramics fit well into the time period when the mill
was known to be in use. Transfer printing is common in sites from 1790 to
1850, and hand painted Gaudy Dutch is dated 1830-1860 (Walker,
1971:116; Roberson, 1974:43). The single maker’s mark recovered dates
1845-1856.
Plates
Number of specimens: 3 sherds (from two vessels)
Provenience: 022, $20, T16
Description: Two sherds are from a whiteware plate with a repousse edge. The remaining
specimen is a body sherd from a whiteware plate.
Basin
Number of specimens: 2 sherds (from one vessel)
Provenience: L16, $17
Description: Whiteware basin or pitcher from which these fragments came had a base about
15.5 cm in diameter.
Bowl
Number of specimens: 4 sherds (from one vessel)
Provenience: C23(2), D22, D23
Description: Whiteware bowl with hand painted, underglaze floral design in red, green, blue,
and black.
Discussion: Gaudy Dutch style decoration usually considered to date 1830-1860 (Roberson,
1974:43).
Vase
Number of specimens: 1 sherd
Provenience: $20
Description: Sherd comes from a straight sided whiteware vessel faceted on the outside. It
may have been a vase.
Maker’s Mark
Number of specimens: 1 sherd
Provenience: K15
Description: Whiteware sherd has the mark and name of Edward Walley and the words
"IRONSTONE CHINA."
Discussion: Godden (1971:97) assigns the mark to Edward Walley, Cobridge, Staffordshire,
ca 1845-1856.
Transfer Ware
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: D22
Description: Small sherd of whiteware with monochromatic red transfer print. Vessel form
could not be determined.
Discussion: Transfer printing was most popular between 1790-1850 (Walker, 1971:116).

BOTTLENECKS
Number of specimens: 4
Provenience: D22, D24, 122, $21
Description: D22: Light green neck sherd without a rim; 13 mm inside diameter of mouth;
possibly from the same bottle as the base with a pontil mark. D24: Olive; rim type M
(Boice, 1980:170); 19 mm inside diameter of mouth. 122: Clear; wire rim with metal
screw on cap attached. $21: Light green neck sherd without a rim; 13 mm inside
diameter of mouth; possibly from the same bottle as the base with the pontil mark.
BOTTLE BASES
Number of specimens: 2
Provenience: D22(2)
Description: One specimen is a green circular base 69 mm in diameter with straight sides.
The other specimen is a light green bottom sherd with a pontil mark.
Discussion: According to Lorraine (1968:36):
A pontil mark is a spot of rough glass in the center of the bottom of a bottle. It is
formed when the pontil rod is attached to the base with a glob of molten glass to
hold the object while the blow pipe is struck off and the raw edge is finished. It was
used exclusively until 1857 when the snap case was introduced to replace the
pontil rod for finishing bottles.

Colored Body Sherds
CLEAR
Number of specimens: 22
Provenience: D16(3), D17, 120(11), 122(4), Lots 27, 55, 62
Description: Clear sherds; one basal corner. Sherds from the mill shaft (Lots 27, 55, and
62) appear to come from the same bottle.
AMBER
Number of specimens: 6
Provenience: D19, E25, 119(2), Lots 26, 28
Description: Amber colored; sherds from 119 appear to be from one vessel. Sherds from
Lots 26 and 28 are from a cylindrical bottom ca 70 mm in diameter.
OLIVE
Number of specimens: 7
Provenience: D19(6), D21
Description: Olive colored; sherds from D21 appear to be part of a circular base.
GREEN
Number of specimens: 12
Provenience: D20, D22(10), 118
Description: Green colored sherds.
LIGHT GREEN
Number of specimens: 11
Provenience: D22(5), $20, $21(5)
Description: Light green body sherds which probably are associated with $21 and D22 light
green neck sherds and D22 light green base with pontil mark.
Window Glass
Number of specimens: 757 (1.37 kg)
Provenience: Table 2
Description: Window glass.
Discussion: The most common artifacts in the mill at McKinney Falls were broken sheet glass.
The largest fragment of window pane weighs 255 gr. Four concentrations of window glass
came from the major excavations in the southern part of the mill. Evidence is too spotty to
reconstruct either a pane or a window. One pane has a dimension of 29.2 cm, but it cannot
be discerned whether that is width or length. Glass thickness is a uniform 2 mm.

METAL
Ammunition

Too few cartridges (10) were recovered from the mill to yield any valid
conclusions, Artifact recovery by the Parks and Wildlife Department was poor
due to low budgeting; consequently, screening was not available. Further
excavation should consider this aspect as any cartridges from the lower levels
will be old.

Fasteners

This functional class consists of 301 specimens which includes nails, rivets,
screws, nuts, bolts, washers, and harness parts. Nails were the second most
common artifact (267 specimens) found at the mill. A total of 139 typable
nails was found, plus eight spikes, three horseshoe nails, a tack, and a staple.
Of the typed nails, 133 were cut; the remaining were hand wrought. Of the
cut nails, 106 were common nails; 12 were finishing nails; and the remaining
15 had hand wrought heads (Fig. 6). Nine different pennyweight classes were
present and a total of 15 different nail types was recovered. In addition to the
typed nails, 115 fragments were recovered.
NAILS
Nails were classified by the following methods. Unbroken nails in good
condition were separated into types and sizes. Using various pennyweight (d)
standards, nails were placed in the general pennyweight class which they
seemed to fit best. These standards include U.S. 1876, 1897, 1931 (Walker,
1971:69); Simmons (1884); A. Baldwin (1891); and Unknown (Fontana
and Greenleaf, 1962:56). After this preliminary sorting, nails were shifted
around until there seemed to be a reasonable break between the different
pennyweights. Then the fragmentary but classifiable nails were added to the
established types on the basis of head style and shank diameter (Table 3).
Nails from the McKinney mill appear to fall into a very short time span.
Absence of wire nails suggests that the nails relate to the mill itself and not to
any later structures. Most nails probably date from the original construction of
the mill, although some may come from alterations or additions made after
the original construction and before the mill was destroyed in 1967.

Description: Nails are 2 1/2 in long (excluding head) and have handmade heads
with two facets each. Direction of iron fibers is lengthwise. Nail plate was cut from
opposite sides.
Discussion: Cut nails with handmade heads were common from 1790 to the mid1820’s when they were replaced with machine headed nails. These early nails
had iron fibers running across or perpendicular to the length of the nail. Around
1840, nails were manufactured with iron fibers lengthwise like the McKinney Falls
specimens (Nelson, 1868).

Description: Shanks are 2 3/4 in long.
10d FINISHING
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: D23
Description: Shank is 3 in long.
Discussion: This nail illustrates the difficulty in using pennyweight classes. Following
Fontana and Greenleaf (1962:56), the specimen can be classified as 10d. Following the U.S. standards for 1876 (Walker, 1971:69), it would be classed as 12d.

Piton or Eyed Wedge
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 48
Description: A simple wedge point, 24 x 9 mm (probably hammered out), formed on
one end of a 20 x 12 mm piece of iron bar. At 10 cm length, the bar turns 90°,
perpendicular to the wide plane of the wedged end, and expands to form a 40 mm
diameter circle with a 16 mm hole (Fig. 12).
Discussion: Form suggests that the wedge was driven into a rock wall and a rope or
pulley attached to the eye which appears slightly worn at the proper points. However, the end opposite the wedge is not battered; perhaps it was never used.

Provenience: Lot 48
Description: Hammer is 223 x 38 x 22 mm and has a rectangular hole 22 x 10 mm and
chisel edges on both ends. Working edges are at right angles to the handle (Fig. 15).
Discussion: The Descriptive Pamphlet of the Richmond Mill Furnishing Works (1873:89)
discusses the three eye sizes made in their factory. Mill picks are for light cracking, heavy
cracking, and furrowing.
MONKEY WRENCH
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 59
Description: Iron monkey wrench has a main bar 15 mm thick with a jaw consisting of three
bars. The upper jaw bar is 112 mm long, 32 mm wide, and 30 mm thick tapering down
and away from the main bar. The lower jar bar is 155 mm long, 32 mm wide, and 30
mm thick tapering up and away from the main bar. A bar 110 mm long, 20 mm wide,
and 15 mm thick slides through a hole in the sliding jaw against the handlebar acting as a
wedge to hold the jaws closed (Fig. 16).
Discussion: Patented in 1835, 1839, and in the 1840’s (six times) under the name Screw
Wrench, it gradually replaced the common wrench as a carpenter’s tool. The sliding jaw
was later adjusted by various forms of screws (Mercer, 1968:278).
REAPER SECTION
Number of specimens: I
Provenience: D19
Description: Tempered steel, 2.5 mm thick, measures 89 mm across the base. It was cut 28
mm from the base on an angle of 45° from each side to an apex 69 mm from the base.
Two angled surfaces were serrated and beveled about 22° to form cutting edges. Two 4
mm holes for attaching this blade to the mower were drilled 13 mm from the base and
16,5 mm from each side (Fig. 17).
SEMICIRCULAR LEATHER KNIFE BLADE
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 50
Description: Semicircular blade, 150 mm wide, 70 mm long, and 30 mm thick. A projection 53 mm long is in the center of the straight edge. It probably was used to connect the
blade and handle. A seamed and banded brass ring, 10 mm wide and 16 mm in
diameter, is on the projection. It bands the handle onto the blade.
Discussion: Sears, Roebuck & Co. (1902:419) shows a 6 1/2 in harness maker’s round
knife with a rosewood handle selling for 75¢.

TAP
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: D20
Description: A fragment, 55 mm long and broken on each end. It had fine threads (.635
mm center to center or 40 to the inch) and would cut a 5.9 mm (7/32 in) hole.
Discussion: Many types of taps found in the Sears, Roebuck & Co. Catalogue (1902:609)
appear similar to this specimen. Fine thread taps were used principally by gunsmiths.
Machinery
ADJUSTING LEVER
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 60
Description: A round 354 mm iron bar with nuts on either end. Nut on one end measures
39 x 40 mm and has charcoal showing on the outside end. Nut at the other end of the
bar measures 33 x 36 mm and has tracks of uncharred wood attached to inside,
indicating that the bar was embedded in wood. An iron lever just below the larger nut
has a diameter of 30 mm at the point closest to the iron bar and a diameter of 26 mm at
the other end. The lever now is rusted in place but appears to have fit loosely around the
bar allowing it to swivel (Fig. 18).
Discussion: This artifact was an integral part of the turbine and came out of place only when
no longer surrounded by matrix. The eyed bar was embedded in the large wooden
collar which surrounds the shaft above the turbine. It is speculated that this setup allowed the miller to adjust the veins or blades of the turbine to proper pitch via an
attached rod and handle which ran up through the floor near the millstone assembly.
References were not found to corroborate this hypothesis.

Description: Wheel fragment is 165 x 40 x 22 mm and has the remnants of a spoke. In
cross section, it looks pentagonal with a 22 mm wide base. Wheel is 400 mm in diameter
and was probably a part of some machinery.
HANDLE
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 61
Description: Specimen is a round metal bar with ends turned up 90° to form two handles
about 185 mm high. The main bar is 305 mm long and 16 mm wide. In the center, the
width of the bar expands to 45 mm forming a diamond shape with a hole in the center
for attachment to the object to be turned (Fig. 19).
Discussion: The handle appears to fit the pinion gear which in turn fits the rack gear.
PINION GEAR
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 48
Description: Pinion gear is 400 mm long and has a central shaft 24 mm in diameter. This
shaft has a U connection on top 68 mm wide, 40 mm tall, and 11 mm thick. A nodule
from the central shaft extends out 12 mm and is threaded and made to take a handle. A
ring 20 mm thick and 62 mm in diameter is attached (welded?) to the center shaft 72
mm below the bottom of the U connection. A second ring is attached 165 mm below the
first ring. Four round bars 65 mm long and 13 mm in diameter equally spaced 20 mm
apart on the rings connect those two rings. Groo~ed, worn places in the bars appear 40
mm above the lower ring. Spacing of the grooves fits the rack gear comfortably (Fig.
20).
PRESSURE HANDLE
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 55
Description: A 167 x 29 mm bar varying in thickness from 25 mm at the center to 4 mm at
each rounded end. Extra metal is built up on one side only; opposite side is flat. A
conical hole 12 mm in diameter is drilled into the built up center on an angle of 45°. Two
other holes, ca 6 mm in diameter and each 44 mm from the center, are drilled completely through the bar (Fig. 21).
Discussion: Although function is unknown, it possibly could be a pivot point for a rotating
pin or perhaps a belt turned pulley.
RACK GEAR
Number of specimens: 8
Provenience: Lots 40(3), 41(2), 43, 48, 56
Description: Part of one long piece, total length at least 1966 mm. Each of the rack gear
segments has from one to four holes. The 225 mm segment and 335 mm segment have
cut nails extending through these holes. The 600 mm segment is charred and has a
wave or bow unlike the others (Fig. 22).
Discussion: Wear patterns of the rack gear match the pinion gear.
SHAFT
Number of specimens: I
Provenience: Lot 37
Description: Cylindrical bar fragment 872 mm long and 63 mm in diameter. A slot in one
end (22 x 18 x 2 mm) accepts a key for attaching a pulley or bearing.

Discussion: Shafts this size commonly are used to transmit power or motion by rotation and
are called king shafts.
WEDGES
Number of specimens: 3
Provenience: D20, Lots 43, 61
Description: Specimen D20 is made of square iron bar stock 24 x 24 mm and 81 mm
long. This artifact is beveled on a single side to form a cutting edge while the opposite
end is battered (Fig. 23a). Specimen Lot 43 is a wedge 235 mm long made of square
barstock 30 x 18 mm. Specimen Lot 61 is an unused wedge (or shim) made of 64 ×
19 mm rectangular stock sheared on one end to 120 mm in length. The other end is
beveled 22° on a single side. The shearing was done poorly, resulting in a trailing lip and
slightly dished long axis.
WHEEL
Number of specimens: 1
Provenience: Lot 53

Miscellaneous Metal Artifacts
BABBIT
Number of specimens: 38
Provenience: D19(2), D20(5), D21, D22(19), E21(2), E22, E23, F19, F20(2), F22, G20,
G23, 118
Description: Miscellaneous pieces of lead of various shapes probably used for a variety of
purposes. There is evidence that some were used in mounting heavy machinery by
being poured into grooves cut into the stone base. One specimen from D19 has a
pattern of striation which suggests that it was used as a bearing for a large diameter shaft.
ELBOW JOINT

Texas Archeological Society

Description: Machine nameplate 346 x 117 x 6.4 mm with four holes 7 mm in diameter,
one in each corner for mounting. Background behind letters is recessed 2 mm. Lettering
indicates that"l. G. WILLIAMS & CO. GALVESTON TEXAS" were the distributors or
agents and "TODD, MACKAY & CO. MANUFR’S. PATTERSON N. J." were the
manufacturers (Fig. 24).
Discussion: Isaac G. Williams was appointed Mayor of Galveston by the newly arrived
carpetbagger Charles Griffin in June 1867 (Graham, 1945:47). At this time, advertisements in the Galveston City Directory (Marston, 1875) failed to show Williams connected with any retail business, agricultural, or manufacturing enterprises.
Earlier (1856), Williams operated the Galveston Agricultural Warehouse at the corner of Strand and Tremont streets. He was a dealer in agricultural implements and
machines and also acted as an agent for several equipment companies on the East
Coast (Polk, 1857). Additional information about I. G. Williams’ earlier enterprises and
his relation to Samuel May Williams (McKinney’s Galveston based partner) requires
further historical research.
About 1835, Joseph Todd began manufacturing machines for spinning Manila, Russia, and other hemp into cordage or rope. He probably manufactured other machinery
including steam engines. The firm’s name was originally Todd and MacKey (sic) until
1848 when Phillip Rafferty joined in the partnership, hence the name Todd, MacKay
and Company. Todd and Rafferty later attained a reputation for steam engines and
boilers after MacKey dropped out (Bishop, 1966(3):226-227; Shriner, 1890:195).
The name plaque must have been made to order for I. G. Williams; and must have
adorned a piece of mill related machinery that was manufactured post 1848 and prior to
1855, the year MacKey left the partnership. As cordage manufacturing was unknown in
the Austin area, it is hypothesized that the machine was a steam engine probably used as
an accessory power source for the flour mill, a sawmill, or both.
WAFFLE PRESS

DISCUSSION
Prospecting
The results of prospecting techniques correlated well with the expected
results with few exceptions. Concentrations of metal artifacts were located at
both the house and mill through remote sensing techniques. Although pH
sediment analysis proved negative, phosphate analysis proved rewarding
with a number of concentrations occurring around the house.
Comparing the value of each technique, the pH studies were of low value
at McKinney Falls. Cook and Heizer (1951) estimates the percentage of various chemicals added to sediment by human effects are of impressive values.
Eidt (1973:206) discounts this when he states that "losses brought about by
leaching and other processes such as oxidation are relatively great..."
Successful pH surveys are lacking in the published literature, but the technique has proved sucessful at several California sites investigated by the senior author. It seems that the pH technique should not be used in areas where
limestone is present in quantity.
Some problems developed with the phosphate survey. When the initial
phosphate test was run, high phosphate was found over the entire prospecting grid. This situation contrasted markedly with samples collected by the site
survey which showed considerable variation in phosphate content. There
was some confusion as to the meaning of the results until it was realized that
the technique of collecting samples was based on sediment testing for agricultural purposes. Agricultural testing utilizes a shallow sampling depth which
apparently is unsuitable for archeological testing. A rerun of the phosphate
survey, utilizing a greater sampling depth, produced the results that were
used to construct the phosphate map. The phosphate survey gave excellent
results at a cost in keeping with the budget of most archeological projects. The
larger the area surveyed, the more valid the results.
Of all the prospecting techniques, the metal detector produced the most
detailed results. Each hit indicated a specific artifact and the distribution of
those artifacts indicated the probable location of various features. The results
require detailed plotting of artifact location and thus a greater amount of field
time than phosphate and proton magnetometer surveying. The nominal cost
of a metal Iocator makes it available for most projects.
When the results of the various techniques are compared to each other by
overlaying the different grid plots, the correlation between the various anomalies is impressive. The phosphate, proton magnetometer, and metal detector surveys produced similar results. Since the most time consuming aspect of prospecting is establishing a grid, it is recommended that as many
prospecting techniques as possible be run over the pattern before resorting to
the more expensive technique of excavation. Prospecting provides an excellent method of generating sophisticated hypotheses before the first shovel of
dirt is taken from the ground.

HOUSe

In the research design for the house, the main hypothesis was that the
"occupation deposit is expected to be thickest close to the house and diminish
rapidly as it approaches the cultivated field" (Ralph and McEachern, 1974:3).
Explicit methodological steps necessary to test the hypothesis were not explored fully.
The definition of what is considered deposit was not expressed in the field
guide; also, how different excavators might interpret the individual excavation units was not considered. Further problems were introduced by not excavating all units to the same depth or to the bottom of the cultural deposit.
Another aspect of the research which was not stated but implied was the
selection of arbitrary 10 cm excavation levels. It was believed that such levels
would produce useful stratigraphic information which would allow the rate of
cultural deposition to be studied over time. However, the cultural deposit was
generally only 12 to 15 cm deep. Early and late artifacts were therefore mixed
in the first level. Five cm levels probably would have produced the desired
information. As a result, the hypothesis as stated is not testable.
The stated hypothesis does indicate the presence of some underlying assumptions which can be used to form a logical, testable, corollary hypothesis.
Cultural deposition is the major depositional factor around the house. Natural
deposition is the predominate factor away from the house. There exists a
relationship between natural and cultural deposition which varies between
the house and field.
Natural deposition can be considered as spatially occurring at a relatively
equal rate, while cultural deposition is localized and unequal in space. This
situation can be expressed as a hypothesis. Given equal volumes of matrix,
artifact density will be highest toward the house and decline as one moves
away from the house.
To adequately test the hypothesis, some artifact classes which would obviously bias the results need to be excluded from the analysis. The house can
be considered a single artifact; inclusion of window glass and nail categories in
the analysis would tend to mask the cultural depositional processes which
were in effect while the house was in use. Nails and window glass more likely
are related to erosional factors (both natural and cultural) which took place
after abandonment.
Three categories of artifacts were selected which were likely to be deposited
while the house was in use. They are bottle glass, scrap metal, and ceramics.
Since the units were excavated to different levels, only the first level (0-10 cm)
was utilized in the analysis. The total number of the selected artifacts occurring
in the first level is shown in Figure 30. The north trench conforms well with the
hypothesized distribution although the artifacts are slightly more concentrated
in N3. The relatively lower number of artifacts in N1 is an anomaly of excavation because one half of the square was located in the foundation.
The east trench differs radically from the predicted model with two distinct
anomalies present at opposite ends of the trench. E1 only contained one
artifact in the selected categories which clearly reflects its location under the
porch. Units E4 and E5 had a much greater number of artifacts than expected, defining a possible trash or midden area. This area may represent a
ditch east of the house where Charlie Johns stated that trash was dumped.

Cistern
The cistern deposit differed from the model predicted in the research design in several ways. It had been assumed that the cistern had been used until
the house was abandoned; but associated artifacts indicate that it may have
gone out of use as early as 1900. Firm evidence of the 1921 flood was lacking. It is apparent that the effect of such periodic flooding was greatly overestimated. However, the assumption that the cistern would contain microfauna
which could be recovered through fine mesh wet screening was borne out by
the rich collection of recovered fauna.
The large number of artifacts recovered from the cistern allows the deposit
to be dated with unusual precision. Two of the bottles in 304 (30-40 cm) were
dated to 1905; filling of the cistern is assumed to have started sometime
around 1900. The uppermost level (301) has two bottles of a type which was
manufactured until 1929 and one of a type which ceased to be manufactured
in 1932. Deposition seems to stop around the mid-1930’s, with only a few
artifacts of more recent manufacture added after that date.
The stratigraphy of the tin cans corroborates the dating provided by the
bottles. Hole-in-the-top cans are the only type present in the lowest level,
while open-the-top rolled seam cans are the only type associated in the
highest level. The open-the-top can generally was accepted by 1922 (Fontana and Greenleaf, 1962:73).
The cistern deposit apparently is associated with the Charlie Johns’ period.
Garbage occasionally was dumped into the cistern until 1936 when Albert
Meeks moved into the house. A few additional artifacts apparently were
thrown into the cistern after the house was abandoned in the mid-1940’s.

46

Texas Archeological Society

The bulk of the faunal collection is fish (46%), followed by mammals
(28%), amphibians (15%), reptiles (10%), and birds (0.5%). The relative
percentage of the different classes remains fairly constant throughout the
deposit (Fig. 31).
The amount ’of fish in the deposit fluctuates slightly, while that of amphibians increases, sharply decreases, and then increases again. Reptiles slowly
decrease as time progresses, while mammals show a corresponding increase.
Fish represent the largest class of animal remains found (46%). This class
consists of Aplodinotus grunniens (freshwater drum), Lepornis sp. (sunfish),
Micropterus sp. (bass),Ictalurus sp. (catfish), Lepisosteus sp. (gar), and unidentified remains (Fig. 32). Lepisosteus sp. is the only identifiable genus
which occurs in quantity in the lower level. Gar is sometimes introduced into
cisterns to help keep them clean by eating insects, rodents, and other things
that fall into the water. The Lepisosteus present in the lowest level is interpreted as a cistern cleaning fish. The other fish and Lepisosteus from the other
levels are thought to be fish that were caught in the stream and cleaned at the
cistern while the cistern was used as a dump. Several fishhooks which were
recovered from the deposit support this interpretation. However, it is possible
that the fish were introduced by flooding.
Amphibians (Fig. 33) comprise 15% of the collection and represent Rana
sp. (frog), Bufo sp. (toad), Chrysernys sp. (slider turtle), Trionyx sp. (softshell turtle), and Terrapene sp. (box turtle). Ten percent of the collection is
reptiles (Fig. 33), consisting of Elaphe sp. (rat snake), Pituophis rnelanoleucus (bull snake), Crotalus sp. (rattlesnake), Agkistrodon sp. (copperhead
or cottonmouth), Phrynosoma sp. (horn lizard), and an unidentified lizard.
The amphibians and reptiles represent animals which could get into the cistern under their own power, although the turtles (Trionyx, Chrysemys, Terrapene) may have come into the cistern in the same manner as the fish, i.e.,
anthropogenically or catastrophically.
Most small animals which fall into the cistern could be expected to have
survived the 5 m drop. Four species seem to have done very well: Rana,
Bufo, Elaphe, and Crotalus. A predator/prey relationship exists between the
snakes, frogs, and toads. An increase in snakes is reflected in a corresponding
decrease in its prey.

Mammals are represented by 28% of the collections: Didelphis marsupialis
(opposum), Canis latrans (coyote), Sciurus niger (fox squirrel), Perognathus
sp. (pocket mouse), Reithrodontomys sp. (harvest mouse), Peromyscus sp.
(whitefooted mouse), Neotoma sp. (packrat), Sigmodon hispidus (cotton
rat), Lepus californicus (jack rabbit), Sylvilagus sp. (cottontail), Sus scrofa
(domestic pig), Bos tarus (domestic cow), Ovis sp. (sheep), Odocoileus sp.
(deer), and unidentified rodent bones. Remains of Sus, Ovis, Bos, and Odocoileus probably were discarded into the cistern. Didelphis and Sylvilagus
could have been deposited in the cistern by man or come into the cistern on
their own.
The mammal distribution chart (Fig. 34) indicates that Sigmodon hispidus
adapted to cistern living, although Reithrodontomys, Peromyscus, and
Neotoma should also survive well. The most surprising element is the absence
of Rattus norvegicus (norway rat) and Mus musculus (house mouse). Both of
these introduced species should have occurred in the area. Cryptotis (shrew)
is another small mammal missing from the deposit.
Birds were rare and are represented by one individual of Gus (domestic
chicken) and an unidentified species.

Mill
Excavation revealed that the type of wheel used in the mill was of the
turbine variety as hypothesized. Further research indicates the statement that
the "presence of a horizontally mounted waterwheel would be considered
proof" (Ralph and McEachern, 1974:2) is not entirely correct. There is some
question as to whether a tub mill should be considered a turbine or ancestral to
it.

48

Texas Archeological Society

Evans (1795:11) states in The Young Mill-Wright and Miller’s Guide:
A tub mill has a horizontal waterwheel, that is acted on by the percussion of the
water altogether; the shaft is vertical, carrying the stone on the top of it, and serves
in place of a spindle; the lower end of this shaft is set in a step fixed in a bridge-tree,
by which the stone is raised and lowered, as by the bridge-tree of other mills; the
water is shot on the upper side of the wheel, in a tangent direction with its circumference.
Evans (1795:28) considered the tub mill superior to other types.
"Having levelled your seat, and finding that you have above 8 feet fall, and plenty
of water, and wish to build a mill on the simplest, cheapest, and best construction
to suit your seat, you will, of course, make choice of a tub mill."
The Young Mill- Wright and Miller’s Guide became the miller’s bible for the
next 50 years. Evan’s (1795) preference for the tub mill over other types
probably did much to encourage the development of the true turbine. The
turbine was invented by Ferguson about 1828 and imported to France where
it was called the tourbillion or turbine waterwheel (Hughes, 1850:56).
Hughes (1850) refers to the turbine as a reaction waterwheel because the
action of the water after it hits the bucket or vane contributes power to the
wheel. Unlike the tub mill, the reaction wheel is placed in the water and not
above it.
As the stroke by impulse is communicated to the bucket of the wheel, only one half
of the power of the column of water is received, until the other action is communicated from the wheel to the body of water in which it stands. But as soon as the
wheel moves it forms a whirling vortex, which acts in a contrary direction to the first
action of the water by impulse; consequently, by this means we receive a double
action of the same water, which gives a double power (Hughes, 1850:54).
A combination reaction wheel is a wheel designed in such a way that water
is applied at the edge of the wheel and discharged at the center of the wheel by
means of curved buckets (Hughes, 1850:58). The waterwheel at McKinney’s
mill is of this type. However, more exact identification of the wheel is difficult.
Within the last ten or fifteen years, a numerous tribe of reaction waterwheels have
sprung into existence, all aiming at the main object, if possible, to supercede each
other in using the least complement of water to perform the greatest amount of
work (Hughes, 1850:55).
The wheel pit forms the heart of the mill and also the millwright’s biggest
headache.
To the old school millwright, the wheel pit was a perpetual nightmare--a continuous performance pit in which he [the millwright] might be called at any minute, day
or night, to do a turn in water to his waist as he wrestled with rusty nuts and bolts in
an attempt to put in a new waterwheel step, three feet under water (Hobart,
1919:378).
One of the ongoing problems with a horizontal turbine wheel was that the
waterwheel step often broke down. This step was a piece of conical wood
placed in the end of the shaft below the waterwheel. At first, this piece did not
fit well; spent water from the turbine would lubricate it. Later, it would begin to
heat up, charring the wood, until charcoal formed and the step began to
crumble under the weight of the waterwheel. At some point, the step would
go down, maybe stripping the above gears.
Development of the iron cased turbine eliminated this troublesome step by
placing the shaft bearing inside the casing. This procedure marked the end of
the large wheel pit required for combination wheels. Iron cased wheels were
available by 1870 and are illustrated in the Descriptive Pamphlet of Richmond

Mill Furnishing Works (1873:Fig. 6). The MCD. Moore Mill in Van Zandt
County (Texas), which started operating in 1871, used an iron cased wheel
(Jackson, 1971:51-52). Use of water turbines to power mills began to fade in
the late 1880’s with the introduction of mechanical and electrical motive
power.
The most noticeable artifacts missing from the McKinney Falls mill collection are gearing, shafts, couplings, pillow blocks, bearings, and accessory
machinery. It appears that everything that could be salvaged was removed.
Much of the building stone was removed from the mill to construct erosion
dams (according to an interview with J. E. "Pete" Smith). Remains of these
dams still are evident about the western part of the park.

Stone Working Tools
Stone used at the house, mill, horse trainer’s cabin, and other buildings was
worked with different tools. Saw cut stone was noted at the house and mill.
Saw diameters were 111 and 91 cm; the one from the mill was not checked.
One stone at the house appeared to be cut with a handsaw.
Almost all rock used at the mill had a rock faced surface. A pitching chisel
was used in finishing most of the stone with occasional use of small droves 4.0
to 6.5 cm wide. The hole in the limestone was drilled with a 3 cm diameter
drill at least a meter long and then blasted.
Chisel work at the house was confined to a toothed chisel 4 cm wide. Most
of the interior smooth saw cut surfaces were roughened by a mason’s pick
which left marks 3.0 to 7.0 cm long and 0.7 cm wide. Marks look like afterthoughts when the stone was in place. Most begin at one o’clock and move to
seven o’clock, as if struck by a right handed mason. The stone was roughened
to accept the plaster.
The horse trainer’s cabin is of limestone with a rock faced surface. Some
chisel work was noted on the north wall and the northeast corner of the east
wall. The work was done by 6-10 cm wide straight chisels, the smaller being
called droves and the larger called tools, boasters, or bolsters (McKee,
1973:21-31). The picnic table downstream and above the supposed hog
wallow was formed mostly with wood and poured in concrete. The few chisel
marks are by droves 4-7 cm. wide.
Cartridges
The distribution of the 65 cartridges in the collection suggests function,
economics, and time. Four poorly dated rimfire .22 caliber cartridges came
from the mill (American Cartridge Co., Federal Cartridge Co., and the pre
1902 Union Metallic Cartridge Co.). The late 1800’s/early-1900’s rimfire
cartridges came from outside the house in the lower level of a trash dump (E5)
or generally in the fill outside the house (United States Cartridge Co., Winchester Repeating Arms Co., Peters Cartridge Co.). The middle-1900’s rimfire cartridges were found inside the house below the fire zone (RemingtonU.M.C., Western Cartridge Co., Peters Cartridge Co.). A .22 caliber Short
(Peters Cartridge Co.) came from level 4 (304) in the cistern.

The distribution suggests plinking or target practice around the house.
Some shells were carried to a dump located east of the house. The main
activity occurred at the turn of the century. Rimfire are the least expensive
cartridges made in general. Rimfire weapons traditionally are popular and
inexpensive.
Center fire cartridges, externally primed, date after 1866 (Logan, 1959:8) ;
the nine in the collection appear to date after the 1880’s. The earliest sample
comes from the mill shaft. This .41 caliber Long Double Action made for the
model 1877 Colt Lightning may be early, but does not date from the time
when the mill was in operation. The absence of any early, externally primed,
center fire cartridges (which became obsolete in 1890) suggests a late date for
all gun activity at this site. Only two of the nine cartridges (.22 W.C.F. and.32
W.C.F) were made for rifles, suggesting small game hunting activities.
Twenty six shotgun shells were recovered, the bulk (15) from the cistern.
The shotgun shell literature is sketchy. The best is Vinson (in Amber,
1968:91-97) which contains some glaring errors but points out the impossibility of extracting exact dates for many brands. Cistern distribution gives a fairly
good time depth; the earliest shells are probably the 10-gauge Winchester
cartridges from the east room of the house and the mill shaft. The one plastic
case indicates small bird hunting (#6 shot); while a #2 buckshot from the
house area (El) indicates larger game.
All but two of the cartridges were fired and none appear to have been
reloaded. The collection suggests the following weapons: two rifles (.22
W.C.F., .32 W.C.F.); one automatic pistol (9 mm Luger); four revolvers
(.32 caliber, .38 caliber, .41 Colt Lightning Double Action, and .44 caliber
percussion revolver); and three shotguns (10, 12, and 20 gauge). Gun parts
were not recovered.
The cartridge collection from the Ward Ranch (Fontana and Greenleaf,
1962:79-83) indicated at least six rifles, five revolvers, and two shotguns. The
balance of these cartridges favors heavier game and military loads. If personal
protection or large game hunting were performed at McKinney Falls, it is not
demonstrable in the colleciton.
The three shotgun shells from the Ward Ranch (Fontana and Greenleaf,
1962) are slightly different from their counterparts at McKinney Falls and
probably date a little earlier. The Ward Ranch New Club cartridge has a
double circle (7.9 mm diameter and 10.7 mm respectively) head stamp
(Fontana and Greenleaf, 1962), whereas none of the six McKinney Falls
specimens has double circles. Two (from the cistern, level 4) lack a design.
The other four New Club cartridges are of two types, both showing eight
pointed star patterns (Lot 16, cistern, levels 2 and 3). Two of the smaller
caliber center fire revolver cartridges (.41 L DA and .38 S&W) are common
to the McKinney Falls and Ward Ranch (Fontana and Greenleaf, 1962) collections.
Many of the weapons were out of time and some badly in need of lepair.
The New Club shell from the bottom of the cistern was bent, the primer raised,
and the firing pin dentent was off to one side. The weapon that fired it was in
poor condition and could have injured the user by misfiring or exploding.

CONCLUSIONS
This report attempted to apply archeology in its widest sense (i.e., the study
of relationships between process and time during the epoch of man) to a
primarily historic site utilized approximately between 1850 and 1950. The
approach is environmental archeology. A particular aspect of the total environment was not singled out as being most important; some attempt was
made to capture the diversity of both archeology and environment. Environmental archeology is not simply anthropology, history, biology, botany, or
any other specifically categorized field of study. It is an attempt to study the
total resource, utilizing the standard approach of hard science which tries to
investigate the interrelationships of the smallest definable data at the least
complex levels of abstraction.
The very breadth of the subject makes conclusions hard to draw, but certain
highlights can be pointed out. In terms of the research designs, the study
largely was successful with the exception of the flood hypothesis which apparently is reflected in much more subtle data than anticipated. Other failures
stemmed from poorly expressed research designs which were not completely
thought out before going into the field. The successes, however, seem to
outweigh the failures; a number of hypotheses bore fruit.
Results of the prospecting experiments were exciting. Archeologists will
come to depend on those techniques to a much greater degree in the future.
Excavations at the house produced the suspected architectural features as
well as a clearer understanding of the nature of the deposit. The depositional
model developed needs further testing in a wider range of sites (and this site),
but it did draw attention to certain anomalies. Perhaps the further development of such models will lead to the discovery of types of anomalies which
have thus far eluded the investigators. Discovery of the relatively high percentage of porcelain around the house was not predicted but seems to bear
out the aristocratic image of McKinney reflected in the historical records.
Results of the cistern excavation far surpassed expectations. The full implications of a well dated faunal assemblage within a relatively closed environmental system has yet to be realized. The analysis presented was preliminary;
a much more detailed analysis and greater sample is necessary before the
value of the collection can be understood.
Mill excavations produced the desired results and discovery of the turbine
was a highlight in the investigations. The combination reaction type waterwheel was an important step in the development of the modern turbine;
the example recovered provides clues to the technological level of millwrighting in 1850.
Application of the environmental approach to the historic McKinney
homestead produced widely diverse but interrelated data reflecting cultural
and environmental processes which have been in effect over the last 125
years. This approach may work best in recent sites where the fossil record is
most complete. Such sites provide the necessary time depth to understand
the development of contemporary ecological and environmental problems.
