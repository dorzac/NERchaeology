ABSTRACT
Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) conducted a 100% pedestrian
survey of a 23 acre tract of land, the site of the proposed Matagorda County Birding
Nature Center in north-central Matagorda County, Texas on May 9-10, 1999. Both
State and Federal agencies were involved in this project that was conducted under
Texas Antiquities Committee permit number 2182 and COE permit 21610. The project
area was investigated by shovel probing and backhoe trenching. No prehistoric or
historic sites were identified in the project area, and it is recommended that construction
be allowed to proceed as planned. Copies of the final report are on file at the Division
of Archeology, Texas Historical Commission and Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin, Texas; the Corps of Engineers, Galveston District; Matagorda
County Nature Center, Inc.; and BVRA in Bryan, Texas.

INTRODUCTION
The Matagorda County Nature Center, Inc. proposes to construct a park on a 23
acre tract of land in north-central Matagorda County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area
is bounded on the north by State Highway 35, on the south by the Colorado River, and
on the east and west by private land (Figure 2). The project area is depicted on the
Markham topographic quadrangle, dated 1995 (Figure 3). Proposed construction
consists of a River Outdoor Educational Facility, trails, bridges, prairie restoration,
wetlands, butterfly garden, parking lot, flower garden, and kiosk.
Matagorda County contains numerous significant archaeological sites, both
prehistoric and historic, and the area has been the subject of several major cultural
resources investigations. Realizing the potential for sites within the proposed park area,
the Texas Historical Commission, Division of Archeology, requested an archaeological
survey by a professional archaeologist. In order to satisfy this requirement, the
Matagorda County Nature Center, Inc. retained BVRA to conduct the survey that was
performed under Texas Antiquities permit 2182, Corps of Engineers (COE) permit
21610 and BVRA project number 99-07. The Principal Investigator was William E.
Moore.
The following general discussion of Matagorda County was taken from the 19841985 Texas Almanac (Kingston and Harris 1983) and a biological assessment of the
Matagorda County Birding Nature Center (Brannon 1999). Matagorda County is
situated in Southeast Texas and consists of 1157 square miles. Elevation in the county
varies between sea level and 70 feet above sea level. Overall, the topography is
characterized as flat broken by bays. The county is drained by the Colorado River,
which bisects the county, and numerous creeks. Annual rainfall averages 47.29 inches.
The January minimum temperature is 48 degrees, and the July maximum temperature
is 90 degrees. These climatic conditions create a growing season of 296 days. The
biological assessment (Brannon 1999) contains an in-depth discussion of the native
plants within the project area.
There is no current soils book for Matagorda County. According to the local
Natural Resources Conservation Service office (NRCS) in Bay City, the soils in the
county are currently being reassessed.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Central and
Southern Planning Region of Texas (Mercado-Allinger et al. 1996:Figure 1.1.4),
Matagorda County is situated within the Southern Coastal Corridor archeological study
region. In 1985, according to a statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical
Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985:159), Matagorda County contained 26 recorded sites.
The site files at TARL revealed 116 recorded sites at the time of this survey. In 1985,
no sites in the county had been excavated, 2 had been tested by hand, and all 26 had
been surface collected. Fourteen recorded prehistoric sites in the county were Late
Prehistoric and five sites were listed as Archaic (Biesaart 1985:165).
It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Matagorda County, especially when numerous contract reports are
available. The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al.
1985), the planning document published by the Texas Historical Commission (MercadoAllinger et al. 1996), and an article entitled A Model for Cultural Succession for the
Coastal Bend Area of Texas (Corbin 1974) for more detailed information regarding the
archaeology of Matagorda County.
The first archaeological examination was conducted in 1932 when Woolsey
recorded the Battle Island site (41MG1). In 1941, G. E. Arnold of the University of
Texas at Austin reported finding one large prehistoric campsite and three shell middens.
In 1971, when Alton K. Briggs published Archeological Resources in the Texas Coastal
Lowlands and Littoral, only four sites were known in the county, and one had been
destroyed by Hurricane Carla.
One of the early (and most extensive at the time) studies in the county was a
survey of the Matagorda Bay area which included an inspection of the lower reaches of
the Colorado River (Fritz 1975). This study used a shallow draft boat for a preliminary
investigation of the Colorado River as the Pleistocene terraces could only be easily
examined from the present river channel. No sites along the Colorado River were seen
from the boat; "the cut banks were devoid of visible archeological remains" (Fritz
1975:10). Also, spot checks on foot at various points along the Colorado and its West
Branch yielded negative information, and local residents knew of no prehistoric sites
along these drainages. Therefore, no further work along this drainage was conducted.
In 1980, archaeologists from The University of Texas at San Antonio surveyed an
area adjacent to the lower reaches of the Colorado. No sites were found along the
river, and the prehistory of Matagorda County was classified as "poorly understood at
present" (Gibson and Gibson 1980).

FIELD METHODS
This project was performed using the 100% pedestrian survey method supported
by backhoe trenching. Selected areas were examined by 5 shovel probes, and it was
determined that the project area could best be examined with a backhoe. Eighteen
backhoe trenches were excavated across the project area (Appendix I), and it is
believed that the 23 acres were more than adequately sampled. Prior to commencing
the field survey, the site records at TARL were checked for the presence of previously
recorded archaeological sites in the project area and vicinity. No sites were found to
exist within the project area. In fact, no sites are plotted along the Colorado River on
the Bay City and Markham quadrangles! Excavated matrix (a sample from each bucket
until clay was reached) from each backhoe trench was screened using 1/4 inch
hardware cloth, and the data obtained were recorded in the field journal and on a log.
The location of the backhoe trenches along the river were measured from the
confluence of the creek and the river using a 30 meter tape. These measurements
were used to plot the approximate location of the backhoe trenches on the project area
map (Figure 2). The remaining 12 trenches were plotted with the assistance of Mr.
Brannon and their locations are approximate.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The site records at TARL yielded no previously recorded archaeological sites in
the project area. A review of the literature revealed that significant prehistoric and
historic sites are present in Matagorda County. No archaeological sites in the county
are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). There are, however, two
sites in the county that are listed as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). These are
the Mad Island Marsh Preserve (41MG60) on the coast and the Caney Creek Historic
Shipwreck (41MG32). Numerous pre-twentieth century shipwrecks are known in the
county. This investigation examined 23 acres, and no archaeological sites were found.
A series of aerial photographs dating from 1943 to 1995 were provided by the
NRCS office in Bay City. They confirmed that the levee to the west of the project area
was in place in 1943 and that little change has occurred with the exception of more
trees present between 1981 and 1995 suggesting that the area may have been used in
the past for agricultural practices. In 1943, there were wooded areas to the north and
west. It appears that the project area and an adjacent section to the east may have
been cleared at one time. This would severely disturb any shallow sites present, if any,
in this area.
Six backhoe trenches (1-6) were excavated on the bank of the Colorado River,
and not one contained cultural materials. The upper stratum in each of the six trenches
consisted of a dark loamy clay between 45 and 60 centimeters below the existing
ground surface. Below that is dark, dense clay that extends beyond the depth of the
proposed construction. This clay stratum resembles basal Pleistocene clays similar to
the Beaumont seen along other rivers by the Principal Investigator and confirmed
verbally to be Pleistocene by Dennis A. Mueck; therefore, no sites should be found
beneath the loamy clay. The remaining 12 trenches were excavated mainly in the areas
of proposed wetlands (several in floodplain settings) where extensive earth moving will
occur and randomly across the project area on low rises above the floodplain. Not one
of these trenches produced cultural materials, and each of the backhoe trenches away
from the river contained hard clay at the surface with no sandy or loamy soils present. It
is, therefore, believed that the 23 acre tract is a low probability area for prehistoric sites.
This statement is based, in part, on the study by Fritz (1975) in which numerous sites
were found along lesser drainages but not along the Colorado River or its west branch.
This suggests that a pattern is emerging that point to this section of the Colorado River
as an area that may be void of prehistoric occupation.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the absence of archaeological sites in the project area, it is
recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as planned. It is always possible
that archaeological sites are missed during any archaeological survey. Should
evidence of a prehistoric or historic site in the project area be discovered during
construction, all work should cease immediately. The Archeology Division, Texas
Historical Commission, should be notified so that this find can be evaluated before
continuing with this project.
