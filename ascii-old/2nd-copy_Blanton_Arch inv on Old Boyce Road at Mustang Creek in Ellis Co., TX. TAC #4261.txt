ABSTRACT
On October 19, 2006 archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates) conducted an
intensive archeological survey on Old Boyce Road at Mustang Creek in Ellis County, Texas, prior to
proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction (CSJ: 0918-22-089). The survey
was performed at the request of Kellogg, Brown, and Root (KBR) on behalf of the Texas Department of
Transportation’s Dallas District. Augmented by systematic backhoe trenching, field investigations
discovered no archeological sites. This was a non-collection survey so there was no curation.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Investigations on Old Boyce Road at Mustang Creek, Ellis County,
Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey with backhoe trenching prior to proposed roadway and bridge improvements on Old
Boyce Road at Mustang Creek (CSJ: 0918-22-089). Investigations discovered no cultural resources.
The existing Old Boyce Road right-of-way (ROW) is approximately 50 feet wide. The roadway is 15 feet
wide with two, seven-foot wide lanes and no shoulders. It crosses a timber bridge constructed in 1955 that
is 118 feet in length and 14 feet wide with two 7-foot wide lanes. Proposed schematics indicate that the
replacement bridge would be a 130-foot long and 26-foot wide pre-stressed concrete structure with two,
10-foot wide lanes and two, 2-foot wide shoulders. The 150-foot long roadway approaches east and west
of the bridge would also be widened and repaved to match the width of the new structure. Plans suggest
that vertical impacts would extend approximately 12–15 feet below ground surface. No detours,
temporary, or permanent easements are necessary for the project. The overall Area of Potential Effect
(APE) for archeology consists of the existing ROW within the project limits. For this project then, the
APE is approximately 430 feet long, 50 feet wide, extends approximately 10 to 12 feet below the ground
surface, and encompasses 0.49 acre.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is located in central Ellis County approximately 1.25 miles
south of the community of Boyce, Texas. The study area is located on the Ennis West, Texas USGS 7.5minute topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 0.49 acre.
DATES OF WORK: 19 October 2006.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and the Antiquities Code of Texas.
PROJECT ARCHEOLOGIST: Brandon S. Young
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4261
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None
COMMENTS: Given the lack of archeological deposits within the project area, Blanton & Associates,
Inc. recommends that the proposed construction be allowed to proceed as planned within the existing
ROW without additional investigations or consultations with the Texas Historical Commission. As the
proposed project area has been extensively modified by roadway construction and maintenance, as well as
buried utilities, it is unlikely that intact buried cultural resources would be discovered during construction.
If the planned construction should require additional work space outside of the existing ROW, then
additional cultural resource investigations in those areas would be necessary.

INTRODUCTION
On October 19, 2006 archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the request of Kellog,
Brown, and Root (KBR) on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Dallas District,
conducted an intensive archeological survey on Old Boyce Road at Mustang Creek in Ellis County, Texas
prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction (CSJ: 0918-22-089). The
project area is located approximately 1.25 miles south of the community of Boyce in north-central Ellis
County (Figure 1).
The proposed highway improvements would involve replacing the existing timber bridge with a wider
and longer pre-stressed concrete span capable of handling current and future traffic. In addition to the
bridge replacement, roadway improvements on Old Boyce Road would involve the widening of the
approaches on the north and south ends of the bridge. The proposed bridge construction will occur only
within the existing Old Boyce Road right-of-way (ROW). No new ROW or temporary or permanent
easements are planned for the construction.
The existing Old Boyce Road ROW is approximately 50 feet wide. The roadway is 15 feet wide with two,
seven-foot wide lanes and no shoulders (Figure 2). The existing 1955 timber bridge is 118 feet in length
and 14 feet wide with two seven-foot wide lanes. The proposed bridge would be a 130-foot long and 26foot wide pre-stressed concrete structure with two, 10-foot wide lanes and two, 2-foot wide shoulders
(Figure 3). The 150-foot long roadway approaches east and west of the bridge would also be widened and
repaved to match the width of the new structure. Schematics suggest that vertical impacts would extend
approximately 12–15 feet below ground surface. According to construction plans, no detours, temporary,
or permanent easements are necessary for the project. The overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) for
archeology consists only of the locations of planned construction impacts. For this project, the APE is
approximately 430 feet long, 50 feet wide, extends approximately 10 to 12 feet below the ground surface,
and encompasses 0.49 acre.
As a political subdivision of the State of Texas, TxDOT’s proposed roadway improvements are subject to
the provisions of the Texas Antiquities Code, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas
Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for recognition and preservation of
State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any state agency must identify potential SALs
through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs. The Texas
Historical Commission (THC) Division of Archeology administers the code’s provisions. Archeological
surveys must be conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the THC in accordance with the
provisions of the code. The project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4261 issued to
Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to protect significant cultural resources that might be threatened by actions that are federally
funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states that the
ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted by federal
agencies. The federal regulatory process is described in detail in the ACHP regulations (36 CFR 800) and
in the regulations of the agencies and federal divisions engaged in historic preservation. Protection of
cultural resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on site significance as
defined by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Although the ACHP is the final arbiter of the

Section 106 process, in practice, the process is typically limited to review and concurrence by the
involved agency and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in Texas by the THC.
Investigations were conducted in accordance with the Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the FHWA,
the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) among TxDOT
and THC. The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined
in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the
Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe
all cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential eligibility for nomination to the
NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural resources be located, make
recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as avoidance, preservation, or
further investigations.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
Ellis County is located within the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic region (Fenneman 1931, 1938).
Geologically, the project area is underlain by Quaternary (Holocene) Alluvium consisting of gravel, sand,
silt, and silty clay floodplain deposits (Barnes 1972). Underlying the adjacent uplands is the Ozan
Formation (“lower Taylor marl”) that consists of clay, silt, and sand that is blocky and has some thin
localized limestone lenses (Barnes 1972). The soil mapped in the project area is Trinity clay, frequently
flooded, which is deep, heavy clay found on the lower portions of floodplains. This soil is alluvial in
origin, with the parent material washed in from the adjacent upland blackland prairie (Brooks et al. 1992).
The project area lies in the Texan biotic province, which represents a transitional zone between the
eastern woodlands and the western grasslands (Blair 1950). The province has been divided into four
subregions: the Blackland Prairie and Grand Prairie of the Blackland Prairies region, as well as the Oak
Woodlands and Eastern Cross Timbers of the Oak Woods and Prairies region. The project area is located
in the Blackland Prairie subregion, which once supported tall and medium grasses such as little bluestem
(Andropyron smithii) and hairy tridens (Tridens pilosus), as well as deciduous riparian species dominated
by American elm (Ulmus Americana), hackberry (Celtis laevigata), and box elder (Acer negundo)
(Diamond et al. 1987).
Based on aerial photographs of the project area as well as the Ellis County soil survey, all of the land use
surrounding the bridge consists of rural upland pasture and cropland. It is very likely that previous (i.e.,
late nineteenth to early twentieth century) agricultural plowing extended to the edges of Mustang Creek
prior to the construction of Old Boyce Road and, in conjunction with natural erosion and roadway
construction/maintenance, has disturbed the area—such activities would have displaced any surface or
shallowly buried cultural deposits. Because the Trinity clay (frequently flooded) in the project area
originated primarily from eroded upland prairie sediments, it is reasonable to surmise that any prehistoric
and/or historic cultural materials discovered on the ground surface and/or shallowly buried in the APE
would be in secondary contexts.

METHODOLOGY
BACKGROUND REVIEW
Archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc., performed a background records review prior to field
investigations to determine the locations of any previous investigations and/or previously recorded sites
within or in close proximity to the survey areas. The background review involved an examination of
records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the THC’s Archeological Sites Atlas,
and an examination of the 1936 and 1961 General Highway Maps, Ellis County, Texas (Texas State
Highway Department 1936 and 1961). The review indicated that there are no previously recorded
prehistoric or historic sites within a 1,000 meter radius of the project area. Additionally, the 1936 county
Ellis County highway map does not depict any structures in or adjacent to the project area. The nearest
archeological site (41EL118) is prehistoric and approximately five kilometers east-northeast of the project
area. The site was recorded in 1990 during the cultural resources survey for the Super Collider Project
(TARL site files, Ellis County).
FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
The archeological survey on Old Boyce Road at Mustang Creek involved surface and subsurface
investigations (backhoe trenching) of sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible,
the significance of any discovered cultural resources. Surface investigations consisted of an intensive 100
percent pedestrian survey of each project area by archeologists systematically examining the ground
surface for cultural remains. Where possible, cutbank profiles were inspected for the presence of any
buried cultural materials.
Because of the presence of Quaternary Alluvium in the project area, subsurface investigations focused on
backhoe trenching. All trenching activities were monitored by archeologists to avoid any unnecessary
damage to potentially buried cultural deposits. Excavated backhoe trenches were approximately five
meters long, one meter wide, and 1.5 meters deep. Following excavations, archeologists immediately
cleaned and examined trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts, cultural features, and/or soil anomalies
in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units identified in each trench were then described in detail, the
location of each trench was obtained with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver, and all
fieldwork was thoroughly photographed.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
This project area was located on the nearly level terraces of Mustang Creek (Figure 4). The creek has an
approximately three to four-meter wide and five-meter deep channel with moderately steep banks that, in
some areas, was littered with brush and flood debris (Figure 5). The project area has experienced both
surface and subsurface disturbances from buried and overhead utilities, as well as bridge and roadway
construction. The roadway approaches sit atop a substantial fill section, with the roadway surface
approximately one meter above the surrounding ground surface outside of the apparent ROW.
Surface investigations found no prehistoric or historic cultural materials, only modern trash and debris.
Subsurface investigations consisted of the excavation of two backhoe trenches (BHT)—one in the
northeast quadrant of the crossing and one in the southeast quadrant—to prospect for buried cultural
deposits (see Figure 4). Paralleling the west side of Old Boyce Road in the northwest and southwest
quadrants of the project area is a buried telecommunications cable (Figures 6 and 7). The cable is buried
in a 50 to 60-centimeter deep ditch between the west edge of the road and the apparent western ROW
boundary. The presence of the ditch and the buried cable precluded trenching or shovel testing in those
quadrants as they retain no intact sediments.
BHT 1 was located in the southeast quadrant of the creek crossing and exhibited four strata from 0 to 200
centimeters below ground surface. The four strata consisted of friable dark brown clay loam (Zone I)
from 0 to 22 centimeters below ground surface overlying three strata (Zones II–IV) of very dense, blocky,
and hard silt clay loam containing occasional pea gravel and calcium carbonate masses between 22 and
200 centimeters (Figure 8). Zone IV was massive, extremely hard and dense subsoil. No archeological
materials were observed in BHT 1, only modern trash and debris (i.e. asphalt, road gravels, and glass)
from 0 to 65 centimeters below ground surface.
BHT 2 was located in the northeast quadrant of the creek crossing and exhibited three strata from 0 to 200
centimeters below ground surface. Zone I (0 to 32 centimeters) consisted of friable dark brown clay loam
overlying two strata (Zones II and III) of very dense to extremely dense, blocky, and hard silt clay loam
containing occasional gravels and calcium carbonate masses from 32 to 200 centimeters below ground
surface. Zone III in BHT 2 was massive and extremely hard subsoil. No archeological materials were
observed in BHT 2, only modern trash and debris (i.e. road gravels, glass, and unidentified metal
fragments) from roughly 0 to 80 centimeters below ground surface.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive archeological survey with backhoe trenching on Old Boyce Road at Mustang Creek found no
cultural resources within the APE. Backhoe trenching revealed only construction fill and disturbed soil
overlying massive silty and clayey soils. The western part of the APE consists of a ditch containing a
buried telecommunications cable that precluded the need for subsurface testing as no intact sediments
remain. No cultural resources will be adversely impacted by the proposed construction and, as such,
Blanton & Associates recommends that the proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement
construction should proceed as planned without additional cultural resource investigations or
consultations.
However, if it is determined that the planned construction requires impacts to occur outside the existing
ROW, then additional cultural resource investigations would be necessary in those areas as the landscape
appears relatively intact. If evidence of archeological resources is identified during construction, work in
the immediate area would cease and TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental
discovery procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
