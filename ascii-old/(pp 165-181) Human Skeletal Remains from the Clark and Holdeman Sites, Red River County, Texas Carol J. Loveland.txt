Human Skeletal Remains From the Clark and
Holdeman Sites, Red River County, Texas
Carol J. Loveland

ABSTRACT
About 6.5 km (4 miles) apart, the Clark and Holdeman sites are situated on
terraces adjacent to the Red River in Red River County, Texas. The 26
individuals from the Holdeman site (41RR11) are dated from A.D. 1000 to
1650. The Clark site (41RR77), from which 39 skeletons were recovered, is
dated from A.D. 1300 to 1600+. Skeletal material from both sites is in fragmentary condition; age and sex determinations were not possible in many
cases. Sixty-nine percent of the skeletal remains recovered were adults. The
ratio of adult to subadult skeletons is similar to that found in other Caddoan
populations. Stature estimates suggest that the Clark and Holdeman people
were comparable in size to other Caddoans. Among the skeletal anomalies
noted were caries, degenerative conditions, infections, traumatic lesions, and
hematologic disorders. Information obtained from this study demonstrates
that small studies are worth the attention of skeletal biologists.

INTRODUCTION
The Clark and Holdeman sites are on the south bank of the Red River in Red
River County, Texas. The Holdeman site (41RR11), which is situated on a river
terrace on the east side of Texas Route 37, was excavated by Gregory Perino, of the
Museum of the Red River, Idabel, Oklahoma, in 1983. Earlier, in 1981, Perino
directed excavation of the Clark site (41RR77), located about 6.5 km (4 miles)
downriver from the Holdeman site.
Burials at both sites span occupation periods of several hundred years. The 26
skeletons recovered from the Holdeman site are dated, by pottery types found with
the human remains, from A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1650. The remains of an additional 15
individuals were not retrieved due to their poor preservation (~erino 1985).
The 39 skeletons from the Clark site are dated to the period between A. D. 1300
and 1600+. The acidity of the soil at both sites contributed to considerable
disintegration of the bones, so almost all of the skeletons are in fragmentary
condition. Although both sites were occupied over an extended period of time, the
poor state of preservation coupled with small sample size necessitated treating
human remains from each site as a single sample.
All of the burials from the Clark and Holdeman sites were extended inhumations, which is the typical pattern followed by the prehistoric Caddo. There was
some difference in burial orientation, however. Nineteen of the 26 individuals from
the Holdeman site were buried with their heads toward the east, ranging between

southeast and northeast. The remaining seven were interred with their heads to the
west or southwest. At the Clark site, 32 individuals were buried headed west through
northwest. One subadult’s bones were so scattered that no orientation could be
determined; the remaining individuals were headed east to southeast.
At the Holdeman site, the burials, which averaged 127 cm in depth, were
recovered from 66 to 163 cm below the present ground surface. The Clark site
interments were excavated from depths ranging between 15 cm (subadult) and 158
cm, with an average depth of 109 cm. An average depth of 99 cm was recorded for
the burials from Kaufman-Williams (Loveland 1980).
Many objects had been placed in the graves with the dead, including ceramics,
bone tools, arrowpoints, plant and animal food items, clay pipes, rattles, and
jewelry.
This paper summarizes the available bioarcheological information about the
biological adaptation of the prehistoric inhabitants of the Holdeman and Clark sites
to their environment. Unfortunately, due to the fragmentary nature of the remains,
only provisional interpretations are possible.
METHODOLOGY
The skeletal material from both sites was cleaned, labeled, and arranged in
anatomical position for study. Standard anthropological techniques were followed
in all observations and measurements. Because the innominate, the most reliable
indicator of both age and sex, was missing from most of the skeletons, it was
necessary to use less reliable characteristics.
Cranial features, such as robusticity of the brow, occipital, and mastoid regions
and morphology of the eye orbits, chin, and posterior part of the zygomatic process
(Bass 1971; Krogman 1978), proved most useful for adult sex determination.
Diameter of the femoral head (Dwight 1905) and circumference of the femoral shaft
(Black 1978) were used as sexing criteria when possible. No attempt was made to
sex subadults.
Adult age determination was based on evaluation of dental attrition (Miles
1963; Brothwell 1965) and closure of endocranial and ectocranial skull sutures
(Krogman 1978; McKern and Stewart 1957). These skeletal changes were compared within each sample, resulting in the establishment of two adult age categories:
(a) individuals 20 to 30 years old, and (b) individuals over 30. A few individuals
could only be classified as adults, due to the fragmentary nature of the remains.
The age of immature skeletons was determined by three methods: (a) evaluation of epiphyseal closure (Johnston 1961; McKern and Stewart 1957; McKem
1970), (b) analysis of dental development (Ubelaker 1978; Schour and Massler
1941), and (c) length of long bones without epipheses (Merchant and Ubelaker
1977).
The formulas established by Trotter and Gleser (1952, 1958) for white females
and Mongoloid males, and by Neumann and Waldman (1968) for American
Indians, were used in stature determination. Long-bone measurements were taken
following the proc’edures outlined in Bass (1964, 1971).

Skeletal anomalies were observed and recorded as skeletons were inventoried
for completeness. In each case the bone involved, as well as the extent and type of
lesion, was documented. S tandard paleopathology references (Ortner and Putschar
1981; Steinbock 1976; Morse 1978; Zimmerman and Kelley 1982; Manchester
1983) were frequently consulted.
DISCUSSION

The poor preservation of the skeletal material from the Clark and Holdeman
sites complicated the paleodemographic analysis. Age and sex determinations of
skeletons from both sites was difficult, and failure to recover 15 skeletons from the
Holdeman site certainly skewed the sample.
The subadult mortality profile was probably affected by bone preservation and
recovery techniques. Gordon and Buikstra (1981) stress that bone maturity is an
important factor in preservation; fragile immature bones are more susceptible to
deterioration than adult bone. Underrepresentation of subadults in a skeletal
population may also occur if children are interred away from cemetery areas.
Furthermore, subadult bone, which is difficult to recognize, may be included in the
faunal sample if archeologists are not careful (Buikstra and Mielke 1985).
The skeletal remains from both sites represent individuals who lived over a
span of several hundred years. Ideally, human remains associated with each time
period at a single site should be evaluated as separate samples; however, due to the
fragmentary nature of the skeletons and the small number of individuals available
for study, only two samples were delineated--one from each site. The Holdeman
sample consists of 26 skeletons and the Clark, of 39.
Paleodemography
Eighteen (69 percent) of the 26 skeletons at the Holdeman site are adults; eight
(31 percent) are subadults (Table 1). One-third of the subadults at the Clark site
(Table 2) were under five at the time of death, whereas half of thesubadults at the
Holdeman site were under five. The subadult mortality rate at both sites falls within
the range of juvenile mortality in preindustrial populations recorded by Weiss
(1973) and is similar to that reported at other Caddoan sites such as KaufmanWilliams (28 percent) (Loveland 1980) and Roden (22 percent) (Rose et al. 1981).
At the Clark site, 45 percent of the adults were classified as female, 48 percent
were males, and for 7 percent, sex determination was not possible. There was
considerable disparity in age at death between males and females. Only 20 percent
of the Clark females were over 30 at the time of death, whereas 75 percent of the
males were over 30. Fifty-six percent of those of unknown sex were over 30. Several
suggestions have been made to account for such differences in adult mortality.
These include the high female mortality during the reproductive period of life
associated with pregnancy, childbirth, or post-partum complications (Powell and
Rogers 1980). Coupled with this is the possibility that women may have been
overworked and underfed, which may have made them more susceptible to lifethreatening illnesses (Manchester 1983). Bass, Evans, and Jantz (1971 ) sugges t that

young males may be underrepresented in skeletal populations due to their having
been buried elsewhere after raiding or hunting accidents.
Ten of the 18 Holdeman adults (56 percent) were males, four (22 percent) were
females, and sex determination was not possible for four (22 percent). Since almost
one-fourth of the Holdeman skeletons could not be sexed, no particular significance
is attached to the sex ratio disparity.
Fifty percent of the Holdeman females and 80 percent of the males were under
30 when they died. This is in stark contrast to the situation at the Clark site, where
female mortality was higher in the 20 to 30 group than among the males, who tended
to survive longer. No explanation of this disparity seems satisfactory except perhaps
that the recovery and analysis of the 15 skeletons that had disintegrated would have
created a more typical mortality profile.
Stature
It was possible to provide stature estimates for five individuals from the
!toldeman site and three from the Clark site (Table 3). The fragmentary condition
of the bones necessitated using whichever long bones were available, but whenever
possible the lower limb bones, especially the femora, were used since they provide
the most accurate estimates of stature.

Trotter and Gleser did not provide stature formulas for Mongoloid females, so
the formulas for white females (Trotter and Gleser 1952) and for Mongoloid
females (Neumann and Waldman 1968) were used. Use of the femur in estimating
stature provided close agreement between the two methods as reflected in the
estimated stature of the female from the Clark site. A greater difference occurred in
the estimated stature based on the two methods when the tibia of the Holdeman
female was used. Stature formulas are developed according to measurements based
on distinct landmarks, so use of the tibia, which can be measured several ways,
provided less satisfactory results.
Stature estimates for two Clark males were derived from the formulas developed by Trotter and Gleser (1958) for Mongoloid males. The Neumann and
Waldman (1968) formulas are based only on the femur and tibia and hence could
not be used. The four Holdeman males whose femora contributed to the stature
estimate were evaluated using both formulas. Scarcely a centimeter separated the
stature estimates for each individual when both methods were used. The estimated
statute of a Clark female was 161.79 cm, following Trotter and Gleser (1952), or
161.54 cm, using the Neumann and Waldman (1968) formula. Clark male stature
estimates ranged between 166.81 cm and 174.16 cm. Use of the Neumann and
Waldman (1968) formula produced a stature estimate for a Holdeman female of
163.15 cm. The estimate for the same individual, based on the Trotter and Gleser

Holdeman site ranged between 165.02 cm and 168.46 cm, using the Trotter and
Gleser (1958) formula, and between 166.50 cm and 168.31 cm, using the Neumannand Waldman (1968) formula.
Since the sample sizes are so small, little can be said about the stature of the
Clark and Holdeman people except that it was probably comparable to other
Caddoan populations (Table 4).
Skeletal Anomalies
Because the Clark and Holdeman remains are fragmentary, the skeletal
anomalies tend to appear as isolated occurrences, often not reflecting the health of
either the individual or the group. This is especially true for abnormalities such as
degenerative conditions and infections. A single bone may show evidence of an
abnormality, but it is difficult to gauge the severity of the condition when much of
the skeleton is missing. For this reason, analysis of the anomalies observed in each
age and sex category at the two sites (Tables 5, 6) suggests areas of possible health
concern for the people, but it does not permit accurate assessment of the health status
of the two populations.
The abnormalities noted in the Clark and Holdeman skeletons have been
divided into the following categories: degenerative conditions, developmental
abnormalities, neoplasms, traumatic lesions, infections, and hematologic conditions. However, it must be stressed that the cause and development of specific
conditions is not always certain, and the etiology of many anomalies often overlaps
these arbitrary classifications.

Degenerative Conditions
Degenerative conditions were noted on skeletal remains at both sites, but evidence of osteophytosis, which is common among the older segments of most populations, was not observed on any of the skeletons from tile Holdeman site. This is
probably attributable to sampling error, since few vertebrae were recovered. The
four males from the Clark site who displayed evidence of osteophytosis were over
30. One individual from the Holdeman site was afflicted with tempomandibular
joint disease, and two skeletons from the Clark site exhibited evidence of osteoarthritis. The distal humeri of one young Clark male indicated very heavy elbow
wear.

Developmental Abnormalities
Developmental anomalies were noted on four Holdeman skeletons. Enamel
hypoplasia was observed on the maxillary incisors of two individuals: a young male
and a subadult. This condition develops in response to general disease processes
and/or nutritional deficiencies occurring during the period of enamel formation, but
E1-Najjar, De Santi, and Ozebek (1978) suggest that the specific etiology is still
idiopathic. Ortner and Putschar (1981) include infectious diseases (especially
tuberculosis and congenital syphilis), metabolic and endocrine disorders, and nutritional deficiencies as factors reponsible for the development of hypoplastic defects.
A lesion on the lateral surface of the right distal femur of a 12-to-18-year-old
subadult from the Holdeman site (Figure 1) was evaluated by Gregg (1985) as

a benign fibrous cortical defect. The base and edges of the 27-by- 11-mm lesion are
smooth, although the edges are slightly raised peripherally. These localized defects
are found in 30 to 40 percent of all children during the period of ossification, but they
usually disappear as growth proceeds (Paul and Juhl 1973).
An abnormality on a long bone of an unsexed adult from the Holdeman site was
evaluated as fibrous dysplasia in the late inactive stage (Gregg 1985) (Figures 2, 3).
An intramedullary lesion expanded and thinned the cortex for a distance of about
12.5 cm along the shaft of the bone. In one place the cortex is less than 1 mm thick;
in another the bone has expanded to 36 x 32 mm. The medullary space is filled with
trabeculated bone. The bone surface remains intact except in one area where the
cortex is broken, exposing the medullary space.
According to Ortner and Putschar (1981) fibrous dysplasia is~ a disease of
unknown etiology that affects females more frequently than males. It usually begins
in childhood and often ceases development in early adulthood. It never involves the
entire skeleton, although more than one bone may be affected.
Similar lesions may be produced by hyperparathyroidism and Paget’ s disease,
but they can usually be distinguished on the basis of age and lesion pattern and
appearance (Zimmerman and Kelley 1982:132).
Neoplasms
The only neoplasms observed on the skeletal material from either site were
button osteomas, small benign tumors composed of osseous tissue.
Traumatic Lesions
Traumatic lesions of the skull and vertebral column were seen on skeletal
remains from both the Clark and Holdeman sites. At the Clark site a healed
depressed fracture was seen on the occipital bone of an unsexed adult and a

12.5 cm. The cortical bone is roughened, and vascular markings are accentuated.

Figure 3. The medullary space is filled with trabeculated bone as a result of fibrous dysplasia.
The interstices within the bone’s medullary space were probably filled with fibrous tissue
during life.

Schmorl’s Node was observed on a thoracic vertebra of a young adult of unknown
sex. According to Knowles (1983), Schmorl’s Nodes are caused by severe strain,
especially from carrying heavy weights during childhood or adolescence. Such
activity may cause gelatinous material in the intervertebral disks to rupture and
create pressure against adjacent vertebrae. As the vertebra yields to pressure, a small
pit or cavity is formed in its body. The presence of Schmorl’s Nodes suggests that
the "workload was fairly severe for teenagers and was probably already imposed on
young persons in their late childhood" (Knowles 1983:69).
At the Holdeman site, a male over 30 years of age had a healed depressed
fracture on the left frontal. Another male, 20-30 years old, had anterior compression
of the fifth lumbar vertebra, probably of traumatic origin.

176

Infections
Three individuals---two from the Clark site and one from the Holdeman site--had dental abscesses. All of the abscesses were associated with caries in the molars.
The Holdeman male had lost the first right maxillary molar antemortem and had a
carious second molar.
Periostitis was observed on tibiae from two skeletons from the Holdeman site
and on lower limb bones of three Clark site individuals. The incidence of periostitis
(7.7 percent) in both the Clark and Holdeman skeletal remains must be regarded
with suspicion, since the skeletons are fragmentary. The combined adult/subadult
infection rate at the Kaufman-Williams site is 25.3 percent (Loveland et al. 1985).
At the Roden site, Rose, Clancy, and Moore-Jansen (1981) fotmd an adult infection
rate of 19.2 percent and a subadult infection rate of 77.8 percent.
Hematologic Conditions
Cribra orbitalia was observed on skeletons from both sites, and porotic
hyperostosis was found on the skeleton ofa subadult from the Holdeman site. These
conditions are usually attributed to iron-deficiency anemia resulting from illness
and nutritional stress (E1-Najjar et al. 1975; Mensforth et al. 1978). Blood loss
caused by intestinal parasites has been suggested by Walker (1985) as a cause of the
anemia.
Although evidence of these conditions appears on only 11.5 percent of the
Holdeman skeletons (all under five) and 2.6 percent of the Clark skeletons, it does
suggest that the people were under some stress. In fact, hematologic disorders may
have played a significant role in childhood morality at the Holdeman site, where
37.5 percent of the subadult skeletons show evidence of either cribra orbitalia or
porotic hyperostosis.
Summary
In summary, the anomalies associated with the Clark and Holdeman skeletons
are similar to those in other Caddoan populations. Infections, hematologic disorders, and degenerative diseases are indicated as health problems of possible severity
faced by the people, but the fragmentary nature of the skeletal remains makes it
impossible to assess the impact each of these conditions actually had.
Dental Caries
At both sites males had a higher incidence of caries than did the females (Table
7). In all categories, the Holdeman population had higher caries rates than
theClark population. The biggest contributors to this disparity, however, were two
individuals whose remains were too fragmentary to either age or sex.
The caries rate at the Clark and Holdeman sites is lower than that reported for
other Caddoan populations such as Bentsen-Clark (14.1 percent) (Buikstra and
Fowler 1975), Roden (23.3 percent) (Rose et al. 1981), and Kaufman-Williams
(15.3 percent) (Loveland 1980). Rose (1982) proposed that caries rates at Caddoan
sites are tied to differential reliance upon maize; populations that depended most
heavily upon maize would have the highest caries rates.

CONCLUSIONS
The people who lived at the Clark and Holdeman sites encountered many of the
same adaptive problems faced by other Caddoan populations. The subadult mortality rate, which is similar to that documented at other Caddoan sites, is somewhat
lower than the rate for many Native American populations (Bass et al. 1971). It
remains to be determined whether the lower childhood mortality observed reflects
a true incidence of childhood death or some aspect of disposal or recovery of the
dead. Caddoan children were frequently buried under house floors rather than in
cemetery areas, so it is possible that not all subadult remains were recovered.
Furthermore, the poor skeletal preservation at many Caddoan sites may result in the
loss of some subadult skeletons.
The demographic profile at the Clark site suggests a high mortality among
young females, whereas 75 percent of the males were over 30 when they died. This
may be a reflection of obstetrical complications, although it is possible too that
young males who died away from home were buried elsewhere. At the Holdeman
site, on the other hand, 80 percent of the males were under 30 when they died. Adult
males are overrepresented there by a ratio of 10 to 4. Four individuals could not be
sexed, and an additional 15 skeletons were not recovered during excavation. The
unequal sex distribution is probably the result of the loss of this skeletal data rather
than an indication of differential burial practices. The Holdeman mortality profile
may be skewed because of sample size and poor preservation.

The anomalies observed on the skeletons from the two sites are among those
most commonly noted on individuals from other Caddoan sites. These include
caries, degenerative conditions, infections, developmental defects, and hematologic disorders. The presence of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis in both
populations provides evidence of disease or nutritional stress. Whether these conditions were the result of heavy dependence upon maize agriculture, use of maize
gruel as a weaning food, culinary practices, or diarrheal or helmith infections remains to be determined. Their occurrence in both populations, coupled with the presence of dental caries and enamel hypoplasia, suggests a health burden whose magnitude cannot be fully assessed because of the fragmentary nature of the remains.
Although the seletons were fragmentary, evaluation of the human remains from
the Clark and Holdeman sites contributes to our understanding of the Caddoan
people. As Westbury (1978:185) stated, "if enough small studies are undertaken,
eventually sufficient data will be available to draw valid conclusions about the
peoples who prehistorically populated the area."
