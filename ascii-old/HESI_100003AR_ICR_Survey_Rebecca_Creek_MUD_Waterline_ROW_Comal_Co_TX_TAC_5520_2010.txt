MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 22 January 2010, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of a proposed 6-inch diameter waterline along Cypress Cove
Road between Knoll Schwope Road and Bluff View Road in northwestern Comal County,
Texas. The proposed waterline right-of-way (ROW) will measure approximately 2400.0 linear
feet (731.5 meters [m]) by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) in width, for an overall Area of Potential Effect (APE)
of 1.7 acres. Because the waterline will be owned and maintained by Rebecca Creek Municipal
Utility District (MUD), the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of
Texas (ACT). In addition, the proposed waterline will require the use of a Nationwide Permit
(NWP) to cross Rebecca Creek. As the NWP is a federal permit issued by the US Army Corps
of Engineers (USACE), the undertaking is also regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. At the request of CMA Engineering, Inc.
(CMA), Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources survey
on behalf of Rebecca Creek MUD. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee (TAC) permit number 5520 in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey
was to determine if any archeological sites were located within the boundaries of the proposed
ROW and, if any existed, to determine their eligibility for formal designation as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP).
The intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed ROW resulted in entirely
negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the proposed ROW or
within any of the 10 excavated shovel tests. Based on the negative findings, it is Horizon’s
opinion that the undertaking will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no
further investigations are warranted. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the proposed ROW. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed ROW, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the find should cease immediately and the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

Right-of-Way in Comal County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of a
proposed 6-inch diameter waterline along Cypress Cove Road between Knoll Schwope Road
and Bluff View Road in northwestern Comal County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). The proposed
waterline right-of-way (ROW) will measure approximately 2400.0 linear feet (731.5 meters [m])
by 30.0 feet (9.1 m) in width, for an overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) of 1.7 acres. Because
the waterline will be owned and maintained by Rebecca Creek Municipal Utility District (MUD),
the undertaking falls under the regulations of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). In addition,
the proposed waterline will require the use of a Nationwide Permit (NWP) to cross Rebecca
Creek. As the NWP is a federal permit issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),
the undertaking is also regulated by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. At the request of CMA Engineering, Inc. (CMA), Horizon
Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the cultural resources survey on behalf of
Rebecca Creek MUD. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC)
permit number 5520 in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of the survey was to determine if
any archeological sites were located within the boundaries of the proposed ROW and, if any
existed, to determine their eligibility for formal designation as State Archeological Landmarks
(SALs) and for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s Principal Investigator.
Reign Clark (Horizon project archeologist) conducted the field investigations on 22 January
2010.
The cultural resources survey consisted of both intensive surface inspection and shovel
testing efforts, with the bulk of the investigations consisting of surface inspection due to the
presence of exposed limestone bedrock and shallow rocky soils along the length of the
proposed ROW. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require
a minimum of 16 shovel tests per mile on linear projects. As the proposed ROW measures
approximately 2400.0 linear feet (731.5 m) in length, a total of 7 shovel tests are necessary to

meet the TSMASS. The Horizon crew exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 10
shovel tests along the proposed ROW. While these shovel tests were conducted along the
length of the proposed ROW, special emphasis was placed on the portions of the ROW located
on opposing terraces above Rebecca Creek.
The intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed ROW resulted in entirely
negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the proposed ROW or
within any of the 10 excavated shovel tests. Based on the negative findings, it is Horizon’s
opinion that the undertaking will have no impact on significant cultural resources and that no
further investigations are warranted. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the proposed ROW. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the proposed ROW, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work at the location of the find should cease immediately and the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The Project Area consists of approximately 2400.0 linear feet (731.5 m) of 6-inch
diameter waterline ROW located immediately adjacent to Cypress Cove Road between Knoll
Schwope Road and Bluff View Road in northwestern Comal County, Texas (see Figures 1 and
2). It can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Fischer, Texas,
topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1). On-site photographs are provided in Figures 3 through
6.

2.2

CURRENT LAND USE

The proposed ROW is currently utilized as roadway easement for Cypress Cove Road.
The roadway travels through Rebecca Creek Park and crosses Rebecca Creek. The south
bank of Rebecca Creek within the current proposed ROW is a broad floodplain with shallow clay
deposits over limestone bedrock. The north bank of Rebecca Creek slopes abruptly and forms
a relatively high terrace composed entirely of limestone bedrock. Residences are situated upon
the north terrace on both sides of Cypress Cove Road.

2.3

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed ROW is situated in an undulating setting typical of the Texas Hill Country.
Surface elevation ranges from approximately 990 to 1030 feet above mean sea level (USGS,
1989). The linear waterline ROW extends across Rebecca Creek near its southern terminus.
Rebecca Creek provides all the drainage for the Project Area (see Figure 1). Rebecca Creek
flows in a generally eastern direction until its confluence with the Guadalupe River
approximately 1.9 miles (3.1 km) east of the proposed ROW. Where the proposed ROW
crosses Rebecca Creek, the channel is heavily incised down to limestone bedrock, with the
adjacent northern creek bank covered with river gravels and limestone boulders. The south
bank of Rebecca Creek is a broad floodplain. On the USGS 7.5’ Fischer topographic
quadrangle (see Figure 1), it would appear that the floodplain bordering the southern portion of
the creek has an increased potential for alluvial deposits. However, this low terrace exhibits
shallow clay soils only 35 to 40 cm in depth over limestone bedrock.

VEGETATION

Vegetation along the proposed ROW is typical of that of the Texas Hill Country,
consisting of scattered live oaks, Ashe juniper, yaupon, agarita, prickly pear, and short grasses
upon rocky upland surfaces (see Figures 4 and 6). Stands of ball cypress trees line the
Rebecca Creek stream course (see Figure 5). The floodplain on the south side of the creek is
maintained as a mown grass field and is part of the Rebecca Creek Park property.

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The archeological record of Central Texas spans the known cultural-historical sequence:
Paleo-Indian, 11,200 to 8000 BP; Archaic, 8000 to 1400 BP; and Late Prehistoric, 1400 to 400
BP. A brief breakdown of this general sequence is presented below.

3.1

PALEO-INDIAN PERIOD (CA. 11,200 TO 8000 BP)

The Paleo-Indian period is believed to be the earliest cultural occupation in the Central
Texas region. This stage is characterized typologically by the occurrence of distinctive
lanceolate projectile points and highly mobile settlement and exploitation patterns. These
populations probably practiced a foraging (i.e., hunting and gathering) type of subsistence
(Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976), although the best-known sites exhibit a focus on the exploitation of
large mammals, including Mammuthus sp. and Bison antiquus. Investigations at sites such as
the Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, and Gault have shown that, during the early part of
the Paleo-Indian, the Clovis stage, subsistence included large herbivores (e.g., mammoth,
bison, and horse) as well as smaller animals such as water turtles, badgers, and raccoons. A
multitude of plants are presumed to have also been an important part of the aboriginal diet.
However, during the later part of the Paleo-Indian period, the Folsom and Plainview stages,
subsistence seems to have depended more heavily on the specialized hunting of big game,
particularly bison. This presumption is based on the fact that only camps, stone-working
locations, and kill sites, mostly in or near grassland habitats, have been documented (Collins
1995:382). This change was most likely attributable to the climate, which had become warmer
and drier than the previous Clovis stage.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8000 TO 1400 BP)

The Archaic period, which covers 2/3 of Central Texas prehistory (Collins 1995), is
divided into 3 subperiods: Early (8000 to 5000 BP), Middle (5000 to 3000 BP), and Late (3000
to 1400 BP) (Hester 1986). The beginning of the Archaic period in Texas represents a similar
transition found world-wide at approximately the same time, the most noted indicators being the
extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and climatic changes. In Texas, there was a gradual
decrease in moisture and humidity reflecting the intensification of warming and drying trends
first noted during the Clovis-Folsom transition. An often-quoted response to these climatic
changes was a greater and more varied use of local resources; in actuality, this was already the
case in most places. Plant-processing implements such as manos and metates and earth

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

ovens become more evident in the archeological record, while the hunting of game continued.
Although still nomadic, people of the Archaic period restricted their travel to smaller areas than
did the Paleo-Indian groups.
3.2.1

Early Archaic (8000 to 5000 BP)

The Early Archaic, the least understood period, is distinguished by the switch from
Paleo-Indian lanceolate-shaped points to notched-and-stemmed points. Overall, the Early
Archaic patterns in Texas are fairly similar throughout the state. Hester (1989) observed that,
prior to 5000 BP, the late Holocene hunters and foragers were essentially indistinguishable in
terms of subsistence strategies across Region 3, which includes the Central Texas Plateau
Prairie, South Texas Plains, and Lower Pecos Canyonlands. After that date, regionally
distinctive projectile points emerge. Hughes (1991) also noted similarities when he wrote that
the Early Archaic typological developments on the Texas High Plains resembled developments
in Central and Southwestern Texas as well as in other bordering regions.
Although settlement patterns for the Early Archaic are little known, it is assumed that the
population density was low and organized into small bands practicing a mobile, generalized
subsistence and settlement pattern. The wide distribution of artifacts suggests that mobility was
high and territories relatively undefined. McKinney (1981), among others, has noted that the
distribution of Early Archaic sites was apparently concentrated along the Balcones Escarpment.
This phenomenon may possibly reflect the greater availability of water resources along this
feature during an arid climatic interval (Hester 1989).
Sites containing Early Archaic components are open campsites such as Loeve, WilsonLeonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Landslide, Granberg II, Jetta Court, and Hall’s Cave. Lithic
materials found within these components include grinding implements, hammerstones, projectile
points, a variety of unifacial and bifacial chipped stone instruments, and Clear Fork and
Guadalupe bifaces. The Clear Fork tools, although indicative primarily of the Early Archaic,
actually appeared in the Late Paleo-Indian period and, in some regions, lingered into Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric times (Hughes 1991).
3.2.2

Middle Archaic (5000 to 3000 BP)

The Middle Archaic is marked by an increased number of sites, which may reflect an
expanding population, the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns, and changes in
settlement, technology, social systems, and territorial boundaries (Black and McGraw 1985:38).
Hester (1986) suggests that, during this period, the inhabitants of the Balcones Escarpment
region developed specialized adaptations to the hunting and gathering of abundant regional
resources, particularly acorns and white-tailed deer.
Site types include open campsites located near streams or tributaries, lithic workshops in
upland areas, and special-activity sites such as hunting camps or food-processing stations
(Black and McGraw 1985). Large burned rock features (hearths and rock ovens) of the early
part of the Middle Archaic gave way in the later Middle Archaic to burned rock middens (Collins
1995).
These latter features have been interpreted as representing several different

10

100003_arch_survey_report.doc

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of a Proposed Rebecca Creek Municipal Utility District Waterline
Right-of-Way in Comal County, Texas

subsistence practices. For example, Hester (1986) proposed that they represent intensive
utilization of acorns, while Johnson and Goode (1994:26) suggested that they were more
frequently being used to cook xerophytes such as sotol. This latter explanation has been
supported by a number of recent investigations where evidence of preserved camas bulbs have
been recovered within oven and midden contexts (Brownlow 2003, 2004a, 2004b; Bush 2004;
Dering 1999, 2002; Mauldin et al. 2003; Ricklis and Collins 1994). Middle Archaic projectile
points include Nolan, Travis, Langtry, and Pedernales (Black 1989), the latter of which is
considered by Hester (1986) to be diagnostic of this time period in the Balcones Escarpment
region.
3.2.3

Late Archaic (3000 to 1400 BP)

The Late Archaic is represented by a continuation, and possibly intensification, of the
subsistence patterns seen in the Middle Archaic (Hester 1986; Collins 1995). The use of
burned rock midden sites continued throughout the Middle Archaic, peaking during the latter
part of this period (Collins 1995). Large cemetery sites are first noted during the Late Archaic
and may reflect the establishment of territories and subsistence schedules (Black 1989:30;
Black and McGraw 1985; Story 1985:49). Hester (1986) suggests that the development of
wide-ranging trade contacts also may have occurred around this time. Characteristic projectile
points include triangular types such as Lange, Montell, Castroville, and Marcos, along with
smaller, expanding-stem points such as Ensor, Frio, Darl, and Fairland.
Although Hester (1986) places the Late Archaic between 3000 and 1400 BP, a later
carving of the Archaic period by Johnson and Goode (1994) attempts to push back the initiation
point of the Late Archaic to around 4300 BP. This more recent division is based on what is
seen as a strong continuity between the material culture and subsistence practices of groups
utilizing the Pedernales point style and those utilizing the later Montell point style. Primarily,
Johnson and Goode (1994) point to similarities in the blade shape of these 2 styles, as well as
similar large, billet-thinned knives utilized during the times of these point styles. They also note
the continuance of Pedernales period plant baking within existing burned rock middens by later
groups utilizing Montell points. In fact, they view this continuity as evidence of a distinct culture
or “folk” on the eastern Edwards Plateau.
In addition to attempting to push back the initiation date of the Late Archaic period,
Johnson and Goode (1994) have also attempted to further divide the Late Archaic period into 2
subperiods (Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II) based on the material cultures as well as climatic
conditions. Their Late Archaic I subperiod coincides with the Dry Edwards Interval when xeric
conditions persisted between 4300 and 2600 BP. Diagnostic projectile points of this subperiod
include the Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Castroville styles. The Lange style
may also correspond to this subperiod based on the recovery of Lange specimens in
association with both Montell and Castroville specimens at site 41WM815 and dated between
2800 to 2400 BP (Brownlow 2003). Johnson and Goode (1994:34) note that burned rock
middens on the Edwards Plateau during the Late Archaic I subperiod are more frequent than in
any other period. The increase in burned rock middens during this subperiod is undoubtedly a
result of the xeric climatic conditions that effectively expanded the ranges of certain geophytes

HJN 100003 AR

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

such as sotol and yucca—foodstuffs that require extended baking periods (in stone-lined ovens)
in order to break down their starches into edible simple sugars. The xeric conditions likely
resulted in the spread of grasslands on the plateau, which would have in turn attracted herds of
buffalo. Plentiful geophytic plants, as well as the presence of buffalo herds, may account for an
increase in human populations in the region as well (Weir 1976; Prewitt 1985).
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic II subperiod spans the time period between
2600 and 1400 BP. They equate this subperiod to more mesic climatic conditions that resulted
in the active aggradation of floodplains at many localities. The Marcos, Ensor, Frio, and Darl
dart point styles are viewed as indicators of this subperiod. Observing a break in the broad
blade stylistic tradition suggested for the Pedernales and Montell styles, Johnson and Goode
(1994:37) suggest that similarities in the Marcos style dart points to styles on the Southern
Plains may indicate an influx of new occupants from the Southern Plains or perhaps a borrowing
of projectile-making techniques from this region. In addition to a perceived influx of new people
or technologies, Johnson and Goode (1994) also suggest some degree of social intercourse
with groups from the eastern US. This is evidenced by the recovery of materials such as whelk
shells and atlatl weights of exotic stone from burials dating to this time period. Although not
conclusive, Johnson and Goode (1994:37) suggest that these materials may indicate a
spreading of Eastern religious cult ideas into the region. While it cannot be conclusively stated
that groups on the Edwards Plateau subscribed to the beliefs and practices of the Eastern
religions, the evidence does suggest that groups on the plateau participated in extensive trading
with Eastern groups, primarily contributing large, thin corner-tanged knives made from local
Edwards chert.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1400 TO 400 BP)

The Late Prehistoric period is separated from the preceding Archaic by the introduction
of the bow and arrow and ceramics. Two phases are recognized within this period: the Austin
(ca. 1400 to 800 BP) and Toyah (ca. 800 to 400 BP) phases. The Austin phase is characterized
by the transition from the use of the atlatl and dart to that of the bow and arrow and arrow
points, particularly the expanding-stemmed Scallorn type. This phase is also distinguished by a
decline in population and changes in settlement practices, in which there was a shift from open
to protected (rockshelter) sites (Black 1989:32; Collins 1995:385). In spite of these changes,
most archeologists agree that Late Archaic subsistence practices and settlement patterns
appear to have continued during the Austin phase (Black 1989; Collins 1995; Prewitt 1974).
The Toyah phase is characterized by relatively rapid changes in technology, notably
pottery (both local and imported from the Caddo area); large, thin bifaces; Perdiz (contractingstem) arrow points; and prismatic blades (Black 1989; Collins 1995). Limited horticulture may
also have begun during this time. The Toyah tool kit was associated with the hunting of bison,
deer, and antelope, and, although nearly all sites dating to this phase have yielded bison bones,
deer was the most significant faunal resource during this time (Black 1989:32). Evidence for
agriculture is seen in the occasional corn cob found at sites such as the Timmeron Rockshelter
in Hays County. Of course, the corn could also be attributed to the same trade network that
was bringing in the Caddoan pottery.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted online via the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas indicated that presence of 2 previously recorded archeological sites
within a 1.0-mile perimeter of the proposed ROW (Figure 7). Both 41CM93 and 41CM208 were
recorded as small aboriginal rockshelters located at the heads of drainages in the general
vicinity of the proposed ROW. Both of these sites are located at least 0.4 miles away from the
proposed ROW and have no potential to be impacted by the undertaking. No previously
recorded archeological sites or cemeteries are located within or immediately adjacent to the
currently proposed ROW. Based on the Atlas data, no prior cultural resources investigations
have been conducted within the proposed ROW.
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and alluvial terraces
near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the fact that the proposed ROW crosses
Rebecca Creek, in conjunction with the presence of the previously recorded sites in the general
vicinity, it was Horizon’s original opinion that there was a moderate to high probability for
prehistoric cultural resources being present within the proposed ROW.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A Horizon archeologist completed the intensive pedestrian survey of the proposed ROW
on 22 January 2010. This was accomplished by walking linear transects along the extent of the
linear ROW and consisted primarily of intensive surface inspection due to the presence of rocky
clay soils and exposed limestone bedrock. Subsurface shovel testing was also utilized, but was
generally unsuccessful to any substantial depth due to these same factors. The Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per
mile on linear projects. As the proposed ROW measures approximately 2400.0 linear feet
(731.5 m) in length, a total of 7 shovel tests are necessary to meet the TSMASS. Horizon
exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 10 shovel tests along the proposed ROW.
While these shovel tests were conducted along the length of the proposed ROW, special
emphasis was placed on the portions of the ROW located on opposing terraces above Rebecca
Creek.
Backhoe trenching was not within the Scope of Work of the current survey efforts.
Although the proposed ROW crosses terraces adjacent to Rebecca Creek, all soils within the
proposed ROW are mapped as rocky clays overlying limestone and marl. As such, the
secondary goal of the current survey efforts was to determine if any areas of deep alluvium
were present within the proposed ROW and, if so, to recommend backhoe trenching efforts at a
later time (see Recommendations in Section 6.0).
A selective-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. Any nondiagnostic cultural materials (e.g., burned rock, lithic debitage, etc.) observed on the surface or
within shovel tests were to be tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently
returned to where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points,
charcoal, etc.) were to be collected for analysis and further documentation. Field notes were
maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests, cultural material observed (if
any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were to be completed for every shovel test, to include
location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any artifacts encountered. Digital photographs
with a photo log were also completed as appropriate. A handheld GPS unit utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 83 map datum was used to record pertinent location data.
Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 8. Shovel test data are provided in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed ROW resulted in entirely
negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface of the proposed ROW or
within any of the 10 excavated shovel tests.
The secondary goal of the investigations was to determine if any areas of deep alluvium
were present within the proposed ROW where mechanical trenching efforts would be required in
compliance with THC guidelines. The cultural resources survey of the proposed ROW resulted
in the documentation of only shallow clay soils overlying bedrock/marl deposits. No areas of
deep alluvium were noted at any location within the proposed ROW.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative findings, it is Horizon’s opinion that the undertaking will have no
impact on significant cultural resources and that no further cultural resources investigations,
including mechanical trenching efforts, are warranted within the proposed ROW. Horizon
therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the proposed ROW.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance of the proposed ROW, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location
of the find should cease immediately and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be
notified of the discovery.
