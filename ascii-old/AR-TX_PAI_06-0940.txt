ABSTRACT
On August 6, 2019, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive
archeological survey of new facilities to be constructed under the 2017 Bond Program at Martin
Luther King Park in east San Antonio, Texas. The survey was done under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 9003. The new facilities will include three parking areas, a restroom and splash pad,
a nature pavilion, trail extensions, and an electrical conduit and lighting fixtures. No historic
or prehistoric sites were identified within the footprint of these park facilities, and Prewitt and
Associates, Inc., recommends that construction should proceed without additional archeological
investigations.
CURATION
Since this archeological survey did not recover any artifacts, this project does not require
artifact curation. Project records and photographs currently housed at the offices of Prewitt
and Associates, Inc., will be transferred to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The
University of Texas at Austin for permanent curation.

INTRODUCTION
On August 6, 2019, personnel with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted
an intensive archeological survey in the footprint of proposed new facilities to be
constructed under the City’s 2017 Bond Program at Martin Luther King Park in
east San Antonio, Texas (Figure 1). The survey was done under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 9003. The planned facilities are as follows: construction of a splash pad
and restroom in an area measuring about 120x140 ft; construction of three parking
areas each measuring about 180x70 ft; construction of a nature pavilion in an area
of 60x100 ft; ca. 3,000 ft of trail extensions; installation of three new light fixtures;
and installation of ca. 1,350 ft of underground electrical conduits. Together, these
improvements will have a horizontal Area of Potential Effects of about 2 acres
(including 4,350 linear feet of trails and electrical conduits). Most disturbance from
these improvements will be shallow (1 ft or less below the surface), but disturbance
could occur as deep as 3 ft where utilities will be placed in the underground conduits.
All work done during this survey complies with the requirements of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191, VTCS
6145-9) and the City of San Antonio’s Historic Preservation and Design Section of
the Unified Development Code (Article 6 35-360-634).
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas, the survey area is situated on
Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits within a tight bend of Salado Creek (Figure
2). No Holocene alluvium is mapped along this stretch of the creek (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1983). The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Web Soil Survey
indicates that Patrick soils, 1–3 percent slopes, and Loire clay loam, 0–2 percent
slopes, occur in the area. The former are developed from clayey or sandy alluvium of
Quaternary age on old terraces, and the latter are developed from loamy alluvium
on floodplains. Vegetation across most of the survey area consists of mature elm,
pecan, and hackberry trees with an open mowed-grass understory. Along the creek
edge, the understory is thicker with second-growth trees, tall grasses, woody vines,
and greenbriers.
RESULTS OF FILE SEARCH
Review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas
revealed that there are three previously recorded sites and seven previous
archeological investigations within 1 km of the project area. The three sites are
41BX1832, 41BX1833, and 41BX1965. Site 41BX1832 is 0.8 km west of the project
area. Recorded in 2009 during a survey for a segment of the Salado Creek Hike-andBike Trail, it consists of a nineteenth-century house site associated with the Alsbury
family. Site 41BX1833, 1 km west of the project area, was recorded during the same
survey. It consists of a lithic scatter extending to a depth of 40 cm below the surface;
trenching also exposed a pit feature extending to 97 cm. Site 41BX1965, 0.8 km
northwest of the project area, was recorded in 2013 as the remains of a twentiethcentury structure (barn, shed, or animal enclosure) associated with modern debris.

One of the previous investigations consisted of survey of the 29-acre San
Antonio Independent School District tract northwest of the current project area in
which 41BX1965 was recorded (Acuña and Sloan 2013). Another was the Salado
Creek Hike-and-Bike Trail segment survey west of the project area in which
41BX1832 and 41BX1833 were documented (Iruegas et al. 2011). The third was a
more-extensive survey of 3 miles of the same hike-and-bike trail, which included the
southwest edge of the current project area (Weston et al. 2004); no sites were recorded
in the park. The fourth project consisted of archeological and historic resources
surveys along East Houston Street north of Interstate Highway 10 (Katauskas et al.
2010); only the east end of this area is within 1 km of the project area, and no sites
were recorded there. The fifth project consisted of survey in 2007 of a sewer outfall
siphon on Salado Creek upstream from the current project area (Held and Darnell
2007); no sites were found. The sixth project consisted of survey in 2009 of a sewer
outfall on Salado Creek downstream from the project area (Galindo 2009); no sites
were recorded. The Atlas does not have an abstract for the seventh project, which
appears to have involved monitoring of highway construction near Salado Creek
west of the project area.
Historic aerial photographs and maps indicate that the project area lacked
improvements over much of the twentieth century. These sources include 1953, 1963,
and 1973 aerials, a 1903 USGS map, a 1927 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers map, and
a 1953 Army Mapping Service map. Thus, based on this evidence, the area seems
to have a low potential for historic sites. Possibly contradicting this conclusion,
however, is the result of archival research done for the Salado Creek Hike-and-Bike
Trail Project, which found reference to a large U.S. Army encampment in Winter
of 1848–1849 along Salado Creek in the area of Martin Luther King Park (Weston
et al. 2004:3).
METHODS OF FIELD INVESTIGATION
The archeological survey of the proposed new facilities at Martin Luther King
Park consisted of 100 percent pedestrian coverage by two qualified archeologists.
As per the Texas Historical Commission’s minimum survey standards, these
archeologists walked the project area on transects spaced no more than 30 m apart,
examining surface exposures for evidence of prehistoric and historic artifacts and
features. Shovel testing was employed in settings with the potential for buried
archeological deposits and where the ground surface was obscured by vegetation.
Shovel tests were 30 cm in diameter and excavated in levels not exceeding 20 cm
in thickness. All sediments removed during shovel testing were screened through
1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth or carefully sorted with a trowel when too difficult
to screen efficiently. A Shovel Test Record form was used to record brief sediment
descriptions and notes about artifact recovery for each shovel test, and shovel test
locations were recorded with a handheld GPS unit. In addition, photographs were
taken of survey conditions, and a photo log and a daily journal of project activities
and observations were kept by a project archeologist. All survey methods used
comply with applicable standards defined or referenced in 13 TAC 26.20 and Texas
Historical Commission policy.

Eighteen shovel tests were excavated across the areas of impact (see Figure
2). The 7 shovel tests in the new parking lots, nature pavilion, and rest room
area exceed the minimum density specified in the Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeological Survey Standards for Texas for projects of this size (3 tests/acre).
In addition, ground surface visibility in these areas was greater than 30 percent
due to the mowed-grass ground cover and existing disturbances (Figure 3). The 11
shovel tests along the 0.82 miles of linear improvements are slightly less than the
16 tests per mile specified in the Standards, but much of the western half of the
new trail and the electrical conduit cross the eroded and sloping edge of Salado
Creek (Figure 4a). Because of the erosion, ground surface visibility here generally
is good, even though the area supports denser understory vegetation. In addition,
some sections of the conduit and trail are already disturbed, as they cross existing
roads or other built features. For example, a north-south section of trail will be built
using an existing rock road (Figure 4b), and the west end of the trail and conduit
are already impacted by park roads and a park bridge.
SURVEY RESULTS
The archeological survey at Martin Luther King Park encountered no
prehistoric or historic sites. Shovel tests in these areas ranged from 5 to 20 cm deep
in a hard dark gray clay loam with some siliceous pebbles (Figure 5). A few tests (JD
1, 2, and 4) encountered fragments of plastic, degraded metal, and clear container
glass that likely result from recent activities associated with the park. In addition,
several of these areas have been impacted by existing roads and picnic facilities
(see Figure 3b). Survey of some segments of new trails and the electrical conduit
corridor encountered similar sediments, although there was about 10 cm of dark
gray silty clay laom above the dark gray clay loam along the eastern sections of the
trail. A single piece of clear glass was encountered in Shovel Test JD9, and crowntop bottle caps, fragments of glass, and plastic wrappers were noted at the surface
along the trail. Again, all of this material can be attributed to recent activities at
the existing picnic areas that follow the creek edge within the park.
RECOMMENDATIONS
No prehistoric or historic archeological sites were discovered by intensive
survey of the proposed new facilities at Martin Luther King Park. Hence, Prewitt
and Associates, Inc., recommends that no additional archeological investigation is
warranted before construction.
