Abstract
Flatrock Enginering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources linear survey of the South
Mainline right-of-way in Glasscock, Howard, and Martin counties, Texas. The Area of Potential
Effect is 31.75 miles long x 80 feet wide, for a total of 308 acres. The entire right-of-way will
cross publicly owned properties, and the entire project is privately funded; thus no state
Antiquities Permit was required. In addition, there are no U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
jurisdictional areas.
The field survey was conducted by four archaeologists during the period March 30 thru April 2,
2015. Surface visibility along the right-of-way varied from 40 to 100-percent, revealing that the
right-of-way passes through cultivated or fallow agricultural fields, upland areas, and floodplains,
with no potential terrace deposits along the few drainages.
During the course of the survey we documented a single piece of a ground stone metate, three
prehistoric open campsites, one prehistoric lithic scatter, a ca. 1940s farmstead, and a ca. 1940s
house site. We have assessed all of these as non-significant. Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas
recommended that construction of the Navigator Energy Systems South Mainline as it is currently
aligned be allowed to proceed as planned.
Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the project should be considered as having “no
effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should
be allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly three individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Mr. Wade Ingle,
Senior Partner at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd., and Ms. Judy Vader, and Mr.
Brannon Norton, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. All were
extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and their overall knowledge of the project
contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s scope of work.
It was indeed a pleasure working with Contract Land Specialists Karry Phillips, Right-of-Way
Supervisor, and Pete Taorminio, Right-of-way Agent at Navigator Energy Services, LLC from
their office in Big Spring.

Another individual who was extremely helpful in the completion of this report is Joel Butler who
masterfully created the map overlays presented. In addition, I very much relied upon Crew Chief
David (Emory) Worrell, and archaeological Field Technicians Belisario Silva and Steven Schooler
with Tierras Antiguas. They are dedicated individuals, and as always, these three “hosses” worked
meticulously to ensure all aspects of this investigation were thoroughly documented in accordance
with Texas Historical Commission and Council of Texas Archeologists standards.

Introduction
Navigator Energy
Services, LLC of
Big Spring, Texas
is the lead agency
for the South
Mainline that is
proposed for
construction
through privately
owned properties
i n Glasscock,
Howard, and
Martin counties in
northwestern
Texas (Figures 17).
Navigator Energy
Services in turn
contracted with
F l a t r o c k
Engineering and
Environmental,
Ltd. of San
Antonio to ensure
the requirements Figure 1. Location of the Project Area in Texas.
for environmental
and cultural assessments would be conducted in a professional compliance manner. At the request
of Flatrock, Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) conducted a cultural resources
survey of the Project Area (PA) during the period March 30 thru April 2, 2015.
The project is privately funded, and will cross privately owned properties; thus no Texas
Antiquities permit was required, and there are no stream crossings under the jurisdiction of the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA).

Project Setting
Geology
As shown in Figure 10, the South Mainline will cross over and through eight geological
formations (Barnes 1994; Judson and Kaufman 1990):
Antler sand (Ka) is component of the Edwards Group and Antlers Sand Undivided Formation of
Lower Cretaceous age. It consists of as much as 500 feet of silty to sandy mudstones, fine- to
coarse grained sandstones that are poorly to moderately sorted and cemented with clay or calcium
carbonate. In places the sandstone may be conglomeratic or ferruginous.
Edwards Limestone (Ked) also formed during the Lower Cretaceous, over 66 million years ago.
It ranges from 300 to 500 feet in thickness. Notably the Edwards Formation consists of medium
gray to grayish brown, fine to coarse-grained chert in abundance.
Ogallala Formation (PoMo) formed during the Pliocene and Miocene Epochs within the Tertiary
Period, and is made up of sand, silt, clay, and gravel. These underlying deposits are capped with
hard caliche several feet thick that is clearly observed on the eroding caprock canyonlands.
Gravels where present, are comprised of localized quartz and quartzite lenses, sandstone,
limestone, chert, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. These gravels, along with surrounding
sediments and soils are commonly found in the eroded lower canyonlands.
The Blackwater Draw Formation (Qbd) is slightly younger than the Ogallala Formation, forming
during the early Pleistocene Epoch, and early Quaternary Period. Eolian in nature, it consists of
fine-grained quartz, silty loams and clay loams found on upland areas in this area of northwest
Texas (Holliday 1989).
Tahoka Formation (Qta), formed during the early Pleistocene. It is comprised of lacustrine clay,
silt, sand and gravels, including fine to coarse-grained quartz.
Quaternary deposits undivided (Qu) consist of dissected areas of alluvium and Pleistocene
deposits. They include sand, silt, clay, caliche, and lag gravels. Formation processes result from
colluvium commonly cemented by caliche, and sheetwash. As the name implies, these deposits
were laid down during the Quaternary and early Holocene.
The final formation mapped along the North Mainline right-of-way is the Triassic-aged Dockum
Group (Trd), made up of sandstone, clay, shale, and conglomerate. The sandstone is fine-to coarse
grained quartz, micaceous, silty, thin bedded to massive, cross bedded, and well indurated. The
conglomerate contains chert pebbles, quartz, sandstone slabs, and petrified wood in the lower part.
The Dockum Group can be as much as 450 feet thick.

Soils
As shown in Figures 11-16, the South Mainline will dissect 34 different soil types that are of
varying depths, resulting primarily from eolian processes, but also alluvial processes along
Mustang Draw, along Calf Creek, around Red Lake, and along Hamilton Draw. As such, these
various soil classifications otherwise imply the potential for the preservation of intact cultural
resources to exist (Stoner et al. 1969; Stoner and Dixon 1974; Dixon 1977; Websoil Surveys
2015). Our assessment of these soils to encapsulate deeply buried and intact cultural materials are
then presented in Table 1.

Elevations, Rivers, and Streams
Elevations above mean sea level (amsl) range from 2,300 feet in Glasscock and Howard Counties
to 3,000 feet in southwestern Martin County. In Howard County, the major drainages are the North
Concho River, as well as Morgan and Wild Horse creeks (Long 1996). In Martin County, a
tributary of the Colorado River drains the northern portion of the county, while Mustang Creek, a
tributary of the North Concho River drains the southern portion of the county. Major water
catchments in Glasscock County include the North Concho River, Lacy Creek, Mustang Draw, and
Dewey Lake (Hunt and Leffler 1996; Leffler 1996; Long 1996).
Flora, Fauna, and Climate
The Project Area lies within the
North Central Plains
physiographic region of Texas
(Figure 17). within the Great
Plains region. However, the
Project Area lies just below the
High Plains area, near the
Caprock escarpment. The High
Plains are highest in their southern
most portion, on the Llano
Estacado Caprock, with elevations
reaching over 3,200 ft above mean
sea level (amsl). Running from the
northern portion of the Texas
Panhandle southward into Central
Texas, the Caprock escarpment
forms an abrupt boundary
between the flat Llano Estacado
and the deeply incised and rapidly
eroding Caprock Canyonlands
along its eastern edge. The
Caprock Canyonlands become
less rugged and incised as the
southeasterly flowing rivers
broaden their valleys, and enter Figure 17. Physiographic Regions of Texas (2014).
20

the Lower Plains region, encompassing generally rolling, low hills and ridges (Boyd 1995; Parsons
1967; Carroll 1996). The topography of the Project Area is generally typified by an undulating
nearly level to rolling landscape with predominately rangelands on loamy and dry soils. However,
portions of the Project Area in Howard County lie at the eastern tip of the Permian Basin, at the
southeastern edge of the Llano Estacado Caprock, and near the western edge of the Edwards
Plateau.
As shown in Figure 18, the Project
Area is situated in the southernmost portion of the Kansan Biotic
Province as described by Blair
(1950). The Kansas Province
includes the Permian redbeds
region south of the Red River, east
of the High Plains escarpment, and
west of the Edwards Plateau. The
Permian red plains consist of open
mesquite savanna. Grasslands are
prevalent, with mixed grasses such
as beardgrass, several species of
grama, and buffalo grass. These
mesquite plains further exhibit
areas of mesquite mottes and a few
other shrubs, interspersed by large
areas of grasses, as well as forbs
such as broomweed and gaillardia.
Interspersed are also shin-oak and
sand sage.
Figure 18. Biotic Provinces of Texas (Blair 1950; TPWD
2015).

However, the Kansan Province is
drained by numerous rivers and
intermittent lesser streams that allow for larger trees such as oak, elms, hackberries, and maples to
survive and thrive. Understory cedars are also prominent in such environs. At least 59 mammal
species have been catalogued within the Kansan Province, as well as land turtles, 14 species of
lizards, and 31 snake species.
The modern climate of the Project Area is classified as semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall
of roughly 16 to 20 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout the year, with
average daily maximum temperatures averaging about 960F in July, to around 290F degrees in
January. The combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in frequent droughts
as well as sporadic periods of abundant moisture, resulting in a growing season of roughly 214-217
days (Hunt and Leffler 1996; Long 1996).

21

Cultural Context and Chronology
The Project Area presumes
cultural affinities both
indigenous to the western
edge of the north-central
Texas region as well as
intrusive influences from
the Southern Great Plains
(Figure 19). Several
scholars have offered
sound but differing
arguments for cultural
chronologies for the
Southern Great Plains
extending into northern
Texas. The cultural
chronology, defined by
complex (in lieu of the
terms phase, interval, or
period) of the North
American High Plains has
been synthesized by
Hofman et al. (1989), and
m o r e r e c e n t l y, t h e
Southern High Plains in Figure 19. Map of Texas Archaeological Regions (adapted from
Texas by Johnson and Black 1989).
Holliday (1995) and Boyd
(1995). It should be noted that the Southern Great Plains complexes are defined by shifts in
climatic conditions and subsistence more so than changes in point style, which are indicators of
change in central and south Texas. The following discussions are primarily derived from Johnson
and Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989). All dates are approximate and
given as years before present (B.P.).
Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited the landscape before 11,500 B.P, solid evidence does not
support their existence. Although human behavior is inferred on stone artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site (Fox et al. 1992:51-73), all are problematic. At Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of north-central Texas, radiocarbon dates initially believed to be from burned
charcoal in human campfires, and approximating an antiquity of 40,000 years were later disproved
as dates on natural coal (Stanford 1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic proof
of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on stable
22

landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell County,
Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and with artifacts
stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances of providing
conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292-294; Collins
and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains were
occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between approximately
11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980) suggests
an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts include
Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people who
made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have documented the
presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture include
bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called “Goshen” may be present (Hofman et al. 1989:34; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973).
A well-documented Paleoindian Clovis site in the southern Great Plains is the McLean site in
Taylor County, west of Abilene (Ray and Bryan 1938; Sellards 1952). Folsom sites in the area
include the Scharbauer site in northwestern Midland County (Wendorf et al. 1955), and the
Adair-Steadman site in north central Nolan County (Tunnel 1977). A fourth site nearby containing
a Milnesand component is Lone Wolf Creek in northeastern Mitchell County (Wormington 1957).
By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison (Bison
antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940), archaeological
evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either extinct or
otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and

23

other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required technological shifts
that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman etal.
1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano Estacado
from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of megafauna and the
changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral change by the
Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic hunter-gatherer
adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was necessary.
In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas, such as deer, fish, and
plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock cooking
features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et
al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were small and highly mobile, an
inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed and that diagnostic types are
seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that
the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the inhabitants to broaden their diets to
pursue plants and animals which would produce the same amount of calories and protein with the
same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi)
argues that the North Mainline area was used more frequently in the Early Archaic than in the
Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to “decline of bison and other game animals on the
Southern Plains.” Story (1985), however, believes that population densities were low during this
period, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few constraints on
their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on diffuse utilization of a wide range
of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as well as rodents,
rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285). Hurt
(1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains decreased,
and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely
scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut harvests
in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black 1989a).
Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment
led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely scattered
bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering
24

season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and processing the acorn
harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens are a result of this
endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt this conclusion (e.g.,
Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock middens are still a matter of
controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems
to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants
(Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of
accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological community,
but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about 4500
B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites, at least in
the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as the
Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or fell
during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of burned
rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the Blue Hole
site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32 (Black et
al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens at Camp
Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County (Houk and
Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in diameter were still
very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have become less
specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base (Black 1989b:30).
Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains area, and we see an
increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the Late Archaic.
However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story (1985:44-45)
believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981), Hitzfelder Cave
25

(Givens 1968), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic populations in central
and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt (1980) further posits that
population in the North Mainline area peaked during the Late Archaic with groups moving into the
area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found in the region were more closely
associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still "pre-ceramic" until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45-47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points.
The most common are Ensor and Frio types (Turner et al. 2011), both of which are short, triangular
points with side notches. The Frio point also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt (1980)
presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's (1974)
contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes, which also
lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.
Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits marks the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including
the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery. Two complexes
following the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from about
2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts into
rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977; Skinner
1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).
Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into the
South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to Hurt
(1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is mirrored
in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due to the
increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the “Protohistoric”. On the Southern High Plains, Hofman (1989:91)
agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were limited European
contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history.” The cultural
26

context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence of outside
ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos and
Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed in
many sources (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb
1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and
Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969;
Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on the
Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache adapted
to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the Spaniards
(Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another group of
nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas (Campbell
1991:111).
A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to warfare
fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among them
(Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages have been
lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994; Johnson and
Campbell 1992).

Site Types to be Expected Along the South Mainline
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Howard and Martin counties are prehistoric open
campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period. Some of these
represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped for
one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of people
that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these same
campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found at these large
campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing multiple
hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from making them,
ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from terrestrial and
aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells. Open campsites
occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine environment that offered a
wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from flowing water
sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different food source that could be
exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and agave
hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze on the northern South Texas Plains,
and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).

27

Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that can be expected along the
North Mainline. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that were
left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The general
absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open campsites suggest
that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time (However, small camp
fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make them more knappable).
Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural outcroppings or surface
exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples of chipped
stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two flakes removed, called
‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the quality of stone that
could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble to
judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior, then the cobble was
tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites are of poor quality,
coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried away from these sites,
what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces
of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large
cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides,
reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further reduce it and make
finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not
found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to areas of south Texas where
raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use,
so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found on
any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops that
were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried today,
and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and lithic scatters in the
three-county area have been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland
slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but differ
from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at times they
28

specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were not yet freed
from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types of sites are rare
in Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not present themselves, and 2)
throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up gravels from the surface than
to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone remains likely to be found at these
sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as well as parent material detritus, and
flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected. Although a handful of prehistoric
quarry sites have been recorded in this area of Texas, they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
Burned rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much
like modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the
larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective
as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable,
another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched
out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion
of the formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and
Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in this
area of Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites
in both upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams.
Historic Sites
Although Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th
century, and Spanish entradas began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no
record of any sort of permanent structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the
North area was generally not considered safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in
1865, and white settlers then began establishing smaller ranches and farmlands.
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of this
area of Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.

Glasscock County History
What bands and tribes of Native Americans may have inhabited the area that what is now
Glasscock is not known. However, archaeological discoveries have yielded diagnostic points and
pottery suggesting that the area was occupied at least periodically from the Paleoindian Period,
some 11,000 years ago, through the Historic Period. Written historic accounts indicate that the area
was used by the Kicakapoos and Lipan Apaches in the early 1800s. Throughout most of the 1800s,
white settlers were not attracted to the area because of the generally arid lands, and for fear of the
Indians.
Even though the Butterfield Overland Mail stages ran through the area in the late 1850s, there were
no permanent settlements. Fort Chadbourne was constructed some sixty miles to the east in Coke
County in 1853, but subsequently abandoned. Then Fort Concho was constructed some 50 miles
to the southeast in Concho County in 1867, and finally, Camp at the Head of the North Concho in
nearby Sterling County was active by 1880 (a.k.a Camp Elizabeth [Brown et al. 1998]). These wre
part of the Pecos Military District. Although a few white settlers had moved into the area prior to
the Civil War, it was not until the establishment of Fort Concho that white settlers began to feel
secure enough to permanently occupy the lands. Following the Civil War, cattlemen began using
the Pecos Trail to drive herds from Fort Concho through the Glasscock County area to the Pecos
River (Greenwood 1937).
Before 1874, the area that is now Glasscock County was part of the vast Bexar County territory.
In 1874, the area was administered by newly formed Tom Green County, and in 1887, Glasscock
County was officially formed from Tom Green County, but was attached to Martin County and then
Howard County until it was officially organized in 1893. Sheep ranching came to the county in
1883 when L. S. McDowell, the first white settler, brought in a herd. Notably, many of the 150
citizens who signed the petition to establish Glasscock County were Mexican-American pastores.
By 1890, there were over 45,000 sheep and nearly 4,500 cattle in the county.
In 1890, a company called the Pecan, Colorado, and Concho Immigration Association promoted
the Glasscock County area as suitable for farming and ranching. Another promoter was the Ohio
Land Company, who drilled wells and built houses. By 1893, the communities of Garden City,
Dixie, and New California were founded near Lacy Creek. New California was named the county
seat, but its name was later changed to Garden City after the original Garden City was abandoned.
Four school districts existed by 1905, the Garden City Gazette Newspaper was published between
1905 and 1913, and the Lee’s Reporter Newspaper was also a competitor for about two years. By
1910, the county census listed 1,143 people.
Although a severe drought occurred in 1917-1918, in 1925 oil was discovered. This was followed
by a short-lived oil boom in 1926. The county’s population has ebbed and flowed since then. But
with the advent of new oil and gas drilling technologies, Glasscock County is once again
experiencing a boom cycle in the early part of the 21st century (Greenwood 1937; Leffler 1996).

30

Howard County History
Situated on the eastern edge of the Permian Basin, the southern edge of the Caprock, and the
western edge of the Edwards Plateau, Howard County was uniquely situated for nomadic
prehistoric Native Americans, early explorers, and later Spanish and Anglo-American settlers. Most
attractive in both prehistoric and historic times was the spring at Big Spring on Sulphur Draw, near
the modern-day city appropriately named Big Spring. Within a generally arid landscape, the
naturally flowing spring attracted coyotes, wolves, and herds of buffalo, antelope, and mustangs.
As such the springs also attracted humans for millennia. The earliest written historic accounts
indicate that both the Comanche and the Shawnee camped at the springs, and fought for the right
to do so (Hazelwood and Ordintz 1996).
Strategically located along the Overland Trail to California, when Captain Randolph Marcy
mapped the trail in 1849, he designated the Signal Mountain Peak area as a recommended campsite.
The Signal Mountains lie roughly nine miles southeast of Big Spring (Tyler 1996). Signal
Mountain, ten miles southeast of Big Spring, was a landmark used by early cattlemen. “In 1849
Capt. Randolph B. Marcy's expedition reached Big Spring on the return trip from Santa Fe and
marked it as a campsite on the Overland Trail to California. The spring was also a campsite on the
Santa Fe Trail from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to El Paso. Early ranchers, among them Adolph Miller
and C. C. Slaughter, reached the area in the late 1870s, and after the ranchers came four-section
plots with squatters' dugouts. In the late 1870s the community of Big Spring began near the spring
as a settlement of hide huts and saloons for buffalo hunters. In 1880 the Texas and Pacific built
through the area, following the line of Sulphur Draw several miles north of the spring. The
community moved to the tracks, and Big Spring became the site of railroad shops and a station.
When Howard County was organized in 1882, Big Spring became the county seat. That same year
a post office started operating in the community, and its first general store opened. By 1884 Big
Spring had an estimated population of 1,200, six saloons, four general stores, and a weekly
newspaper (the Pantagraph). Several private schools were operating in the community by 1890, and
the town had a public school by 1898" (Hazelwood and Ordintz 1996:537-538).
A series of droughts and other factors in the early 1900s forced the large ranches to either
significantly downsize or sell out altogether. However, a boon to the economy of Howard County
came in the 1920s in the form of an oil boom, and the population increased three-fold. The number
of farms also increased, and although the Great Depression forced many out of business, the oil and
gas business remained a mainstay, just as it is today (Long 1996).

Martin County History
Although evidence of Native American presence for several thousand years within what was to
become the modern political boundary of Martin County has been well documented
archaeologically, written documents are only extant beginning with the 1700s. It is clear that the
Comanches displaced the Apaches, and then dominated this area of west Texas by about 1750.
Then, in the 1870s, the United States Army forced the Comanches from the region, opening the
31

area for white settlers. By 1876, lands were set aside from the vast Bexar County for the
establishment of Martin County. During an interim period from 1876 through 1884, the
administration of Martin County was attached first to Mitchell County, and then to Howard County.
Finally, in 1884, there were enough citizens in present-day Martin County so that its own
government was established, and Stanton (previously named Mariensfield) became the county seat.
At that time, springs in this area of west Texas were still flowing; one of those well known to
Indians and the U.S. Army was at what today is known as Mustang Pond, the first water source that
emigrants encountered some two miles west of modern-day Big Spring.
In 1881, the Texas and Pacific Rail Line was built through the Big Spring area, and spurred an
expansion of population in Martin County. New settlers moved into the area and began cattle
ranching and sheep ranching endeavors, and farmed grain, cotton, vegetables, and orchards. To
supplement their subsistence, they hunted wild game such as antelope, deer, quail, a the few buffalo
that remained on the open prairie/grassland.
By 1890, the number of settlers in Martin County had increased from only 12 ten years before, to
262. By 1900, the population had increased to 332. By 1920, cotton became the major cash crop.
Much like the rest of the nation, the Great Depression of the 1930s affected this rural area of west
Texas. Nevertheless, Martin County’s economy rebounded during WWII. By the 1940s, there were
over 22,000 acres being farmed in Martin County.
Oil and gas production came relatively late to Martin County compared to the rest of the
surrounding Permian Basin region. Although a few wells were drilled in Martin County the 1920s,
the only significantly producing well did not come in until 1945. Then, in 1950, several deep oil
fields were discovered, and an oil boom was underway (Stoner and Dixon 1974; Hunt and Leffler
1996). Thanks to modern technology such as horizontal drilling and fracturing in the early part of
the 21st century, the citizens and ranchers of Martin County are once again experiencing a robust
economy.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within Glasscock, Howard, and Martin counties, the results simply provide the data
that is available. In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed
based upon the types of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. To wit,
a review of the Texas Atlas indicated that there were only three known archaeological sites within
one mile of the Project Area. That said, the data that is available on the Texas Atlas is only as good
as the surveys represent. The vast majority of these three counties has never been subjected to
formal cultural resource surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological
record is very poorly understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished
provide at least some aspect of what the area looks like from an archaeological perspective.

32

Glasscock County
A review of the archaeological sites recorded within Glasscock County as of April 23, 2015
revealed that there were only a total of 45. However, we also note that very few professional
cultural resources surveys have been conducted in the county, and all of those have been done
along recently installed wind energy transmission lines and oil and gas pipeline rights-of-way.
Undoubtedly, there are dozens if not more, archaeological sites that have not been documented.
That said, the prehistoric archaeological record as we know it consists of six campsites, nine lithic
scatters, and two lithic procurement sites. Temporal diagnostics observed on these sites suggest
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupations, roughly 2,500 to 350 years ago. Given the evidence
of Archaic and Paleoindian occupations in the surrounding counties and region, we surmise that
is it is highly probable for such occupations to have also existed in Glasscock County. Otherwise,
there have been 13 historic components documented within the county. They include numerous
early 1900s farmsteads, ranching sites, and trash dumps/scatters, as well as the site of the 19061937 Fairview School, wooden braces across Salt Lake for a 1930s oil pipeline, WWII bombing
practice targets, an early 1900s family cemetery, and the only State Archeological Landmark in the
county - the Glasscock County Courthouse and Jail constructed in garden City in the late 19th
century (Atlas 2015).
Howard County
As of April 20, 2015 there were 122 archaeological sites recorded within Howard County. Evidence
of ancient hearths, along with diagnostic projectile points indicate that 61 of these sites had been
used as open campsites from as early as the Paleoindian period, and through as late as the Late
Prehistoric periods (see Figure 6). Thirty-two of the 122 sites have been classified as lithic scatters,
where an abundance of chipped stone with more than a few temporal diagnostics also indicate these
sites were being used from the Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric periods. At 13 of the sites, the
chert, quartzite, and other cobbles/gravels that were exposed to the surface have been tested and
used to manufacture stone tools over several thousand years. Other prehistoric sites within Howard
County include two documented rock shelters, two areas where bison bones were eroding from
cutbanks, and two locales with mammoth bones, one of which had Paleoindian dart points in
association. Historically, a total of 12 components have been recorded. These include 1880s
through 1950s farmsteads, house sites, and trash dumps/scatters, and a Civilian Conservation Camp
from the 1930s. The only documented State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) in Howard County
is the Patton-Hayden House in Big Spring (Atlas 2015).
Martin County
A total of 69 archaeological sites had been recorded in Martin County as of April 20, 2015. Fortyseven of those are prehistoric open campsites, and five are prehistoric lithic scatters. Notably, some
of the more significant campsites and lithic scatters are adjacent to playa lakes. At one Early
Archaic campsite an ancient well believed to date to that time period was documented. In addition,
pottery sherds such as Chupadero Black-on-White, Brushed brownware, El Paso polychrome, and
Ochoa indented have been found, indicating either long distance trade or adopted ceramic
technology and styles. The 23 historic components documented in Martin County consist of
numerous late 1800s and early 1900s trash dumps and scatters. However there are also late 1800s
and early 1900s farmsteads and house sites, WWI bombing range practice targets, and the site of
Carmelite Monastery/Sisters of Mercy Convent in Stanton.

Previously Documented Archaeological Sites and Surveys
The northern-most segment of the Navigator South Mainline is shown in Figure 3. A review of the
Texas Atlas indicates that there had been no professional archaeological surveys conducted within
one mile of this northern segment, nor were there any documented archaeological sites within one
mile. The probability that this segment of the pipeline will impact significant archaeological
deposits is minimal. However, without an on-the-ground physical survey, this can only be
surmised.
Segment 2 of the proposed South Mainline (Figure 4) traverses terrain that features the upper
portion of Calf Creek, as well as the western edge of Red Lake, and as such, the potential for
buried, intact, and extant significant archeological deposits to exist is high. As shown in Figure 5,
two archaeological sites have previously been recorded in this locale – 41HW44 and 41HW45.
41HW44 is a prehistoric open campsite situated an arroyo with a seep spring feeding into a lake
or playa. Recorded in 1932, archaeologists at the time observed projectile points, hammerstones,
and ground stone manos (Atlas 2015).
41HW45 was also first documented in 1932, and is also located along a drainage fed by a seep.
Besides burned rocks representing hearths, artifacts found at that time included stone scrapers,
hammerstones, and a stone knife (Atlas 2015).
As shown in Figure 5, there are no documented archaeological surveys or sites within one mile of
Segment 3 of the proposed South Mainline. Although the terrain through this segment is relatively
unremarkable, and suggests a minimal potential for buried, intact, and thus significant
archaeological deposits, without an on-the-ground physical survey, this assessment can only be
surmised. Notably, the upper portion courses adjacent to Hamilton Draw, a possible magnet for
prehistoric occupation during periods where the draw was likely spring-fed.
As shown in Figure 6, there are no documented archaeological sites in close proximity to Segment
4 the proposed Navigator South Mainline. Our assessment for this segment is the same as for
Segment 3; that is, although the terrain through this segment is relatively unremarkable, and
suggests a minimal potential for buried, intact, and thus significant archaeological deposits, without
an on-the-ground physical survey, this assessment can only be surmised.
As shown in Figure 7, there are three documented archeological sites in close proximity to Segment
5 the proposed South Mainline.
41GC24 is a conglomeration of six sites comprising WWII bombing practice targets. These
include a replica target of ship, bullseyes, circles, and crosshairs of caliche construction built by
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for training bombadiers at San Angelo.
41GC26 is described as a prehistoric lithic scatter of an unknown age with chipped stone debitage
and a hammerstone situated along a ridge line paralleling Mustang Draw. It was discovered 2013
during a pipeline survey for Cross Tex Energy.
34

41GC27 was documented by archaeologists in 2014 during a survey for the proposed Bearkat to
Crown Quest Pipeline. They describe it as an historic, abandoned pipeline site, with remnants of
wooden braces from an above-ground portion of the old pipeline that was fashioned from round
wooden posts and planks, possibly dating to as early as 1929 (Atlas 2015).
As shown in Figure 8, there are no documented archaeological sites in close proximity to this
southern-most portion of the proposed Navigator Midstream South Mainline. Although the terrain
through this segment is relatively unremarkable, and suggests a minimal potential for buried, intact,
and thus significant archaeological deposits, it also crosses upper tributaries that were likely springfed at least periodically in prehistoric times. Without an on-the-ground physical survey, an
assessment of the potential for buried and intact cultural resources can only be surmised.

Background Review Summary
From this preliminary cultural resources background review, it was clear that the proposed
Navigator South Mainline right-of-way in all probability, would encounter previously
undocumented archaeological sites. This is best manifested by the scant few professional surveys
that have been conducted in Glasscock, Howard, and Martin counties. Some of the sites that were
likely to be encountered along the Navigator South Mainline right-of-way may be heavily disturbed
and/or redundant site types, and as such have little to contribute to the prehistory of west Texas.
These sites should be considered as non-significant, and should not impede the pipeline’s
construction as planned. However, it was also clear from this review that there was a moderate to
high probability that archaeological sites of significance could lie in the planned right-of-way.
Although the number of sites in this area of Texas, and their potential significance can be modeled,
because of the scant few professional surveys that have been conducted in these areas to date, under
less stringent standards, such models are considered unreliable. Accordingly, without an on-theground archaeological survey, the ubiquity of archaeological sites and their scientific research
potential along the Navigator Midstream South Mainline would remain an unknown.
In sum, it appeared that the pipeline was to be routed through areas that may be sensitive to
archaeological deposits. To be sure of our desktop assessment, Tierras Antiguas recommended that
a full pedestrian survey be conducted along the Navigator South Mainline right-of-way.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical framework
35

is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the regions.
The historic framework is structured around the 1800s and 1900s settlement in the area as
documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests, government representatives, and
early Anglo-American settlers, through the Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty periods,
and into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, and thorough pedestrian survey of the linear
right-of-way was conducted. Four archaeologists meandered back and forth across the 27-meter
(80-foot) wide right-of-way to ensure more complete coverage. In addition, all cutbanks, and rodent
and mammal backdirt piles along the right-of-way were thoroughly examined.

In accordance with a general “no collection” policy, cultural material of a redundant nature, both
prehistoric and historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via
sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic artifacts,
particularly those artifacts which could be considered as significant to the interpretation of Texas
prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were
to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator
and/or the Project Archaeologist. Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences
adjacent to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and included in this report of
investigations. In addition, any potentially historic structures/sites visible along the periphery of
the right-of-way were to be photographed and their locations recorded with a GPS.
The five archaeological sites discovered were mapped using a pace-and-compass method, as well
as a GPS. Field notes were made about the sites and a sketch maps were drawn. Digital photographs
of the sites and selected artifacts were taken, as well as selected photographs representing the
surveyed right-of-way in general, and a photo log was maintained.

38

Results of the Investigation s
Typically, fine sandy loam and clay loam soils with fragmented caliche were encountered in the
western and central portions of the ROW, while shallower fine sands and fine sandy loams were
present along eastern portion. Two isolated prehistoric finds, four prehistoric sites (41GC26,
41GC31, 41GC32, 41MT73), and two historic sites (41GC33 , 41MT74), were documented during
the survey. Their locations are shown in Figure 23, and they are described below.

41MT73
Description
41MT73 (Figures 24 and 25)
consists of a dispersed scatter of
fire-cracked rocks, one chert
scraper, a small quantity of lithic
debitage, and one ground stone
mano fragment. It is situated on a
flat plain 45 meters south of an
intermittent draw, and some 150
meters west of a salt lake (Red
Lake). The immediate area sets in
a previously cultivated, but now
fallow field that is gradually being
overtaken with invasive weeds and
grasses. Soil on the site is Midessa
fine sandy loam (MdA),
commonly found on slopes from 0
to 1 percent in this area of Martin
County. In this case, the site’s
surface slopes from south to north,
from approximately 2,481 to 2,483
feet.
Levels of Effort and Results
An inspection of the surface both
within and immediately adjacent
to the 24-meter (80-foot) right-ofway revealed that cultural material
has been dispersed across an area
Figure 24. 41MT73 site map.
of approximately 1,800 square
meters, extending roughly 45 meters (e-w) x 40 meters (n-s). A thorough inspection of small animal
backdirt piles revealed no evidence of buried cultural materials. In addition, no cultural material
was found in any of the six shovel tests excavated. In general, shovel testing revealed reddish
brown fine sand to 50 centimeters below the surface (cmbs), underlain by brown silty clay with
dense calcium carbonates to 60 cmbs. Artifacts observed on the surface included a mano fragment,
a chert biface, two interior chert flakes, and perhaps a dozen pieces of fire-cracked rocks (see
Figure 26).
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
This appears to have been a relatively small, and short-term prehistoric open campsite occupied
during an unknown period in prehistory. It is situated on a broad flat plain in close proximity to an
intermittent drainage 45 m to the north that was likely spring-fed and flowing periodically.
Otherwise, it lies just west of a fairly large salt lake (Red Lake) and two previously recorded large
40

campsites (41HW44 and
41HW45). Its location on
the landscape would have
afforded advantageous
access to fresh water in the
draw, as well as aquatic
species and subsistence.
In its current heavily
disturbed condition, other
than its positioning on the
landscape, we assess the
site as possessing minimal
research potential. In view
of this, Tierras Antiguas
recommends that
construction of the South
Mainline as planned be

41GC31
Description
41GC31 (Figures 27 and 28) consists of a
dispersed scatter of fire-cracked rocks,
one chert side scraper, and a small
quantity of lithic debitage. It is located on
a very subtle rise in an otherwise upland
flat plain planted in wheat. The closest
known source of water is in Mustang
Draw, some 3,000 meters to the west.
During our April 2015 visit, the field had
been left fallow, and surface visbility was
greater than 95 percent (see for example,
Figure 24). Soil on the site is Patricia fine
sand (PaB), commonly found on slopes
from 0 to 1 percent in this area of
Glasscock County. In this case, the site’s
surface is approximately 2,605 feet above
mean sea level (amsl).
Levels of Effort and Results
An inspection of the surface both within
and immediately adjacent to the 24-meter

(80-foot) right-of-way revealed
that cultural material has been
dispersed across an area of
approximately 1,050 square
meters, extending roughly 35
meters (e-w) x 30 meters (n-s).
Shovel testing revealed reddish
brown fine sand to 20 centimeters
below the surface (cmbs),
underlain by reddish brown sandy
loam to 40 cmbs, then reddish
brown sandy clay to 60 cmbs. No
cultural material was found in any
of the six shovel tests excavated.

eight fire-cracked rocks (see Figure 29 for examples).

42

Site Summary, Conclusions, and
Recommendations
This appears to have been a small,
and short-term prehistoric open
campsite occupied during an
unknown period in prehistory. Its
location is generally
unremarkable, as it remote from
present-day known streams or
water sources, as well as raw
material exposures. However, the
surrounding vegetation at the time
of occupation was likely very
different than the cleared and
cultivated fields that exist today.

condition, other than its
positioning on the landscape, we assess the site as possessing minimal research potential. In view
of this, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the South Mainline as planned be
allowed to proceed through the site, with no further archaeological investigations.

41GC26
Description
41GC26 (Figures 30-32) consists of a dispersed scatter of burned caliche, an untypable dart point,
a chert hammerstone, and lithic debitage. It is located on the edge of an upland plain overlooking
the broad Mustang Draw valley below, some 180 meters to the south. Typical west Texas
vegetation covering the upper portion of the site that has not yet been significantly eroded to the
underlying caliche consists of assorted cacti, sparsely scattered low mesquite brush, and bunch
grasses. Soils on the site abruptly transition from Cottonwood association loams (COD) on the
upper, sloping plain to Bippus clay loam (BcA) as the terrain drops steeply into the valley. As such,
the site’s surface slopes from north to south, from approximately 2,530 to 2,520 feet.
Levels of Effort and Results
This site was first documented in 2013 during a survey of the Bearkat to Crown Quest Pipeline for
Cross Tex Energy. At that time, archaeologists observed a single chert hammerstone and chert
flakes. A single shovel test in the upper portion of the site yielded a tertiary flake 20 cmbs. In 2015,
four Tierras Antiguas archaeologists examined the heavily eroded surface and found six tertiary
flakes, six pieces of burned caliche, and an untypable dart point (see Figure 33 for examples).
These were all found within the gullied caliche landscape on the southern portion of the site.
43

Site Summary, Conclusions, and
Recommendations
This site appears to have been a relatively
intensively occupied prehistoric open
campsite on the periphery of an upland
plain at its juncture with, but tethered to
and overlooking the riverine environs of
Mustang Draw. As such, its location
would have afforded opportune access to
both seasonal upland game animals and
plant resources, as well as fresh water and
aquatic subsistence species in what was
likely a spring-fed Mustang Draw at least
periodically in prehistoric times. During
our 2015 examination of the site, an
abundance of water was present in Salt
Lake at the end of Mustang Draw, some
220 meters to the southeast.
Nevertheless, in its current heavily
disturbed condition, other than its
positioning on the landscape as an Archaic
open campsite, we assess the site as
possessing minimal research potential. In
view of this,
Tierras Antiguas
recommends that
construction of the
South Mainline as
planned be allowed
to proceed through
the site, with no
f u r t h e r
investigations.

flakes (see Figure 36 for
examples). The three specimens are from cream-colored, fine-grained chert, and show no evidence
of heat treating. These were all found within the gullied caliche landscape on the northern portion
of the site.
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
This site appears to have been temporarily used for manufacturing stone tools on the periphery of
an upland plain at its juncture with the riverine environs of Mustang Draw. As such, its location
would have afforded opportune access to both seasonal upland game animals and plant resources,
46

as well as fresh water and
aquatic subsistence species

prehistoric times. Notably,
this site is located at the

Antiguas recommends that construction of the South Mainline as planned be allowed to proceed

41GC33
Description
This site is a ca. 1940s house site in a rural area of northeast Glasscock County with remnants of
cut limestone, an adjacent depression, and a few historic artifacts (Figures 37-38). It is situated just
east of an upland knoll, and on a gentle northeasterly facing slop toward Mustang Draw and Salt
Lake, some 600 meters to the north. Since the house site was abandoned, the immediate area is now
overgrown with typical west Texas vegetation, including low mesquite tress, assorted cacti, and
sparse bunch grasses. These are supported by the soils in the immediate area which are Medissa
fine sandy loams, commonly found on slopes of 1 to 3 percent slope in this area of Glasscock
County.
Levels of Effort and Results
Archaeologists conducted a thorough examination of the site’s surface within the pipeline’s 80-foot
ROW and observed three clear glass bottle sherds with no hue, two stoneware sherds with highly
glossed brown glazed interiors and exteriors, three metal barrel hoops, and three iron stove parts
(see Figure 39 for examples). As shown in Figures 33 and 34, a scatter of cut limestones lay on the
southwestern corner of a shallow depression that measures approximately 27 feet (n-s) x 24 feet
(e-w). The three iron barrel hoops were found to the southwest of the depression, while the glass,
stoneware, and iron stove parts were found nearby the cut limestones. As shown in Figure 33, an
old two-track road courses just to the east of the site.

47

Site Summary, Conclusions, and
Recommendations
This site appears to have been a small
house just west of a two-track road, in a
rural area of Glasscock County. The cut
limestones on the southwestern corner of
what was apparently the house depression
could represent a chimney foundation,
although no evidence of burning was
apparent. No other construction material
such as brick fragments or nails was
observed across the site. The clear glass
bottle sherds with no hue suggest a post1940s occupation. The stoneware sherds
with highly glossed and glazed interiors
and exteriors also suggest a 1940s or later
occupation. Three metal barrel hoops
found on the site could well be from the
same era. A review of aerial photogrpahs
and old topo maps online does not show a
structure at this location in 1954, 1963,
nor 1965.
In its current heavily disturbed condition,
other than its positioning
on the landscape is
interesting and a
component in the historic
development in this area of
Glasscock County, we
assess 41GC33 as
possessing minimal
research potential. In view
of this, Tierras Antiguas
recommends that
construction of the South
Mainline as planned be
allowed to proceed through
the site, with no further
investigations.

41MT74
Description
This site is a ca. 1940s farmstead in a rural area of southeast Martin County, but at an intersection
of modern-day IH-20 and CR 4051 (Figure 40). Although on the periphery of the proposed South
Mainline ROW, a stone house structure is the prominent feature (Figure 41). Otherwise, a concrete
foundation that was likely a barn is also extant (Figure 42). Since the house site was abandoned
perhaps 20-30 years ago, the immediate area is gradually being overgrown with typical west Texas
vegetation, including low mesquite tress, assorted cacti, and sparse bunch grasses within Gomez
fine sandy loam, commonly found on slopes of 1 to 3 percent slope in this area of Martin County.
Levels of Effort and Results
Archaeologists conducted a thorough examination of the site’s surface within the pipeline’s 80-foot
ROW and observed five clear glass bottle sherds with no hue, and five whiteware sherds with no
decorations or makers marks. As shown in Figures 41 and 42, there are two structural remains on
the site. The first is what appears to be a structurally sound stone house (Figure 41). The second
is the foundation remains of what was likely a barn. Overall, the house with concrete porches
measures 35 feet x 40 feet. The barn foundation lies 80 feet north-northwest of the house, and

49

measures 16 feet x 32 feet. As shown in Figure 43, a two-track road and an ATV trail course
through the site.

51

Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
This site is a ca. 1940s farmstead with a one-story limestone block house that appears to be
structurally sound despite being gutted of windows, doors, and interior decorations. The toppled
base of a steel water tower is located southeast of the house. There is also the concrete foundation
remains of what may have been a barn located 80 feet NNW of the house.
Notably, as shown in Figures 40 and 43, the pipeline will be bored under the majority of the site,
and the house structure will not be impacted. It is possible that the western edge of the barn’s
foundation could be impacted. As such, no further archaeological investigations are recommended
within the pipeline’s ROW, and that the construction of the pipeline be allowed to proceed as
planned. However, we recommend that before any additional impact to the site is proposed,
archival investigations should be conducted to ascertain a detailed history of the site, in conjunction
with an architectural study of the house.

Isolated Finds
Isolated Find 1
Isolated Find 1 (see Figure
32 for location) is a
ground stone metate
fragment found on a
heavily eroded surface
void of vegetation at
N 3 5 6 1 0 1 0 E 2 457 2 9
(NAD83). A thorough
examination within the
pipeline’s 80-foot right-ofway provided no other
evidence of cultural
material. This particular
specimen (Figure 40) has
been fashioned from
coarse-grained, gray
sandstone and exhibits

partial calcification on its dorsal surface (see Figure 40). It is 3.3 cm thick on the edge, with only
a slight concave surface. Although interesting, this isolated artifact in and of itself is not considered
as significant. Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the South Mainline be allowed to
proceed as planned, with no further archaeological investigations in this immediate area.

Isolated Find 2
A single cream colored, non-heat treated, fine-grained, bifacial manufacturing flake (Figure 45)
was found on the surface of a sand dune blowout at N3543717 E250609 (NAD83). A thorough
52

examination of the surface with sparse
vegetation within the 80-foot ROW
revealed no other evidence of cultural
material. Given the shifting sands, it
highly unprobable that any other cultural
materials that may be at this locale lack
integrity. As with Isolated Find 1, this
isolated artifact in and of itself is not
considered as significant. Accordingly,
Tierras Antiguas recommends that the
South Mainline be allowed to proceed as
planned, with no further archaeological
investigations in this immediate area.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
The field survey was conducted by four archaeologists during the period March 30 thru April 2,
2015. Surface visibility along the right-of-way varied from 40 to 100-percent, revealing that the
right-of-way passes through cultivated or fallow agricultural fields, upland areas, and floodplains,
with no potential terrace deposits along the few drainages.
During the course of the survey we documented a single piece of a ground stone metate, three
prehistoric open campsites, one prehistoric lithic scatter, a ca. 1940s farmstead, and a ca. 1940s
house site. We have assessed all of these as non-significant. Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas
recommends that construction of the Navigator Energy Systems South Mainline as it is currently
aligned be allowed to proceed as planned.
Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the project should be considered as having “no
effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should
be allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds
are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and
by the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.
