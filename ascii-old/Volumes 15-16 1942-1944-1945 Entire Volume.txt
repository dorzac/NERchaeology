NOTES ON THE DECORATION AND FORM
OF ARKANSAS GADDO POTTERY
BY S. D. DICKINSON
The urge to decorate their pottery was strong among the Caddoes
of southwestern Arkansas.’ The majority of the vessels they made
bear considerable decoration.

But they always held in check their

desire for ornamentation, never forgetting that decoration is secondary and shape is primary in good design.

Their standard of taste,

I assume, was largely determined by utility like that of primitive
potters the world over.

Usage naturally controlled the shapes or at

least was responsible for the original forms which might have been
continued through the years partly because of tradition.
In ceramic decoration one might expect more freedom--~nore in
the choice of motifs and their combination into patterns than in the
techniques.
to flourish.

Here individuality should have had its greatest chance
Using only a fear motifs, the potters could have

achieved innumerable combinations. The Caddoes did work out
a wide variety of distinctive patterns which is not at all surprising.
Yet, in some instances they appear to have been guided by group
feeling in the choice of certain designs for certain shapes. How far
this went is at present debatable. That would require an extensive
count of shapes, patterns and techniques represented in a number of
widely scattered public and private collections of Caddoan material.
Only then could one be absolutely sure of his ground. Lacking sufficient statistics, I wish to point out only suggestions of artistic conventions which dictated the type of decoration for specific shapes.
My observations are based on illustrations in the works of Clarence
13. Moore and M. R. Harrin~on, and specimens in the collection of
Federal Judge Harry J. Lemley, Hope, Arkansas, and in my own
collection.
Caddo forms are functional. The vessels are light and easy to
handle. Even the cooking pots are usually less heavy than pieces
of approximate size made by Middle Mississippi potters in northeastern Arkansas. Although varied in shape, Caddo pottery shows

10

economy in design. Harringt~m’s classification of shapes1 includes:
Bowls---Conical form, Semiglobular :[orm, Cazuela form, Intermediate form.
Pots--Urn form, Globular form, Semiglobular form, Vase.like
form, Cylindrical form.

Bottles (Sub-classification based chiefly on decoration rather
than shape)mWith necks, Neckless.
E]]igy an~ Eccentric Forms

These shapes are essentially spherical, conical and cylindrical in
contrast to some Coles Creek pieces which follow a rectangular
pattern,z Their function as containers seems to have been foremost
in the potter’s mind. Mass was reduced to minimum requirements.
Structural features which might have impeded use of the vessel were
avoided.
Proportions were refined.

This is more evident in the vessel sil-

houette thart in its dimensions, because placement of the maximum
and minimmn curvatures has much to do with the appearance and
determines the measures or rhythm of the component parts of the
vessel mass.

Take the urns, for example, whe.re the oral diameter

approximately equals the height. Here the potter created an optical
illusion of different proportions by constricting the v~l at a point
customarily about two-thirds from the base.

obvious.

Had this constriction

would have been

Curves are subtle, less abrupt than Middle Mississippi silhouettes.
When there is a decided change in curvature as in the eazuelas each
half of the silhouette frequently :forms an "in:finite curw~’~ as Ruskin
defiaes it.3 The same holds true fro" many long necked bottles.
One plane flows into another, a feature structurally desirable as well
as more pleasing to the eye.
Eccentric shapes are rare.

Compound’~ and zoomorphic vessels

*Excluding many bottles having short bulbous necks which Moore
thought represented "a cup placed upon the body of the bottle--a
compound form.’’z~ Some may be. However, it is difficult to determine where conventionalization stopped.

constitute a minor percentage of Caddo pottery. Rarely were attempts made to model entire vessels realistically in the shapes of
animals and humans. Fish (Plate I) and quadrupeds (chiefly
turtles and bears), and quail done fairly realistically are occasionally seen in collections of Caddo pottery. A few bottles modeled
with human features are known. Their rarity and style suggest
influence from the Middle Mississippi. Usually when potters wished
to give vessels zoomorphic ornament they were content to model a
head of a bird, bear or rabbit on one side and a tail on the opposite.
Conical and semiglobular bowls were the forms generally chosen
for such decoration. Bottles with zoomorphic ornament on the neck
have rather globular bodies. Effigy forms are more common in
the Ouachita than in the Red River Valley. Occassionally the Caddoes modeled handles in the form of quadrupeds or placed small
figures on the side of bowls and bottles. M0deling was more subordinated to conform to vessel shape than it was in the Middle Mississippi ceramic complex.
The grotesque element which figures so prominently in the design
of much Middle Mississippi pottery is ahnost if not entirely absent
in Caddo.

There is no macabre spirit evident.

Apparently the

Caddoes were especially conscious of Iine. Possibly this accounts
for them directing their attention to refinement of shape and to
linear decoration rather than to flamboyancy in form and boldness
in painted and relief designs.
A minor percentage of bottles and bowis are plain. Undecorated
bottles may be of any of the Caddo forms. The bowls most fiequently unadorned are. the conical ones.

Some of them, however,

have ~alloped ri~ns. ,’\lso, a few highly polished and engraved ones
having all-over patterns have been found in the Ouachita Valley. Undecorated urns and absolutely plain cooking pots of the g!obular,
semiglobular, vase and cylindric.a] forms are decidedly uncommon.
Decoratio~t of the neckless bottle--a cylindrical or conical jar
having a small aperture in the top of the vessel--shows regional
variation.

The form is most common in the Ouachita drainage and

rare in the Red. Those found in the vicinity of Friendship, Hot
Spring County, near the Ouachita ]~iver itself are frequently decorated with engraved scrolls.5

Upstream above Hot Springs in Gar-

land County the jars are more often plain.

Along the Little Mis-

souri, coming into the Ouachita from the west, in Clark County, the
jars I have seen are absolutely plain.
Harrington illustrates one from Ozan, Hempstead County, which
has parallel lines incised below the orifice.6

This may not be

Caddoan. A Coles Creek prototype of the Caddoan neckless bottle
or jar, found by Judge Harry J. Lemley at the Crenshaw Site, Miller
County, bears art incised pattern of scrolls and punctations.7
Ceramic decoration is of two types: (A) Integral which is structurally part of the vessel, conceived as a part of the form and if removed
would alter the shape.

(B) Applied which could be removed with-

out affecting the basic shape, having been added after the vessel
form was completed. It in turn may be subdivided into (1) Painting or Slipping; (2) Relief; (3) Intaglio. The last consists of
brushing, punctating, stamping, possibly combing, incising and engraving.

The most common type of integral decoratior~ is the vertically
scalloped rim, occuring in most cases on conical bowls. Some urns
have a four-scalloped rim. A few semiglobular bowls and a good
many cazuelas have an everted rim scalloped horizontally. Four is
the usual number of scallops on the everted rims of cazuelas. The
lip may be notched also. Certain vessel appendages might be considered as integral decoration, though they had a functional origin.
The bulbous legs of tripod bottles from the Ouachita and the upturned pointed sides of handles on Red River pots are quite pleasing
to the eye as well as serviceable.
Absence of pottery with painted

designs is sufficiently note-

worthy to be considered a negative trait of the Cadd~ ceramic complex. Vessels are found having a red slip which was certainly added
for decorative effect. However, the painting is a mass and not a
pattern; motifs are not present.

Pottery first given a red film and

later engraved is patterned, of course, in two colors because the
underlying paste has been exposed.

Enough of the film sometimes

was removed to leave slightly raised designs in red, more or less
isolated on the background which is normally buff co!ored. But
this properly belongs to the engraving technique instead of to paintPLATE 1

ing, as does rubbing red and white pigment into engraving. Semiglobular bowls and intermediate forms were sometimes filmed with
red and then engraved. Neither filming alone nor with engraving
seems to have been favored by Arkansas Caddoes when decorating
cazuelas. Both methods were used on bottles. Pots and urns do not
often have a red slip. I am not familiar with a single neckless
bottle or cylindrical jar of the Caddoan complex that was painted
or painted and then engraved.
Applique consists chiefly of nodes and fillets.

They were used

either together or alone, and frequently with intaglio designs. Nodes
applied en mass occur on walls of conical bowls, occasionally on
semiglobular ones and less frequently on rims of cazuelas that slope
inward.

In the decoration of urns, bands of nodes were applied

to form ciretes or meanders or they fill the center of incised concentric circles.

Isolated nodes were combined with incising or en-

graving on bowls of intermediate form.

In the Upper Ouachita

drainage one occassionally sees red filmed bottles decorated Mth
nodes just belm~r the juncture of the tall neck.
Long and short fillets are most co~mnon on urns and cooking pots.
They were plain or crenulated possibly in imitation of cordage.
Pots having long fillets or long series of short ones are more typical of the Red than the Ouachita Valley. Bands were placed up
and down the vessel body, dividing it into panels or were arranged
in simple geometric figures.

They were also put on handles, as were

nodes, though pot rims were not a favorite place for such ornament.

Bottles decorated with fillets are rarely found in the Red River
Valley in Arkansas, but in the Ouachita Valley fillets were much
more popular for bottle decoration. Long necked, flat bottomed,
red filmed bottles having double bands in low relief swirling from
the neck down the body are characteristic of sites in the vicinity of
Hot Springs.
The fluted bottle occurs throughout the Ouachita area in Arkansas,
apparently being most abundant in Clark County. Its body is rather
conical, sloping to a straight neck which has a flat or an ovate lip.
The base is usually rounded. All exterior surfaces were polished.
Below the nebk and equidistant are three groups of fillets, each
group being composed of three strands of clay placed side by side

16

and smoothed together forming one fluted surface.

Near the base

there are similar groups either right under the others to balance
them or else to the side for the sake of contrast. (Plate II, Fig. a)
Thus, two horizontal zones were created on the body, further
divided into three each by the groups of fillets.

Spaces beLween the

upper groups have wide, engraved, horizontal lines; those below ¯
are filled with alternating plain and engraved crosshatched bands
running vertically or laterally. When they are lateral the bands
accentuate the conical silhouette of the bottle body.

Variations of this pattern--still confined to the same shape--are
found less frequently in the same area. The upper horizontal zone
for decoratior~ on the body is raised (an integral feature) and instead of flutes there are four parallel, incised vertical lines. (Plate
II, Fig. b) The remaining decoration may be similar to that on the
regular fluted bottle or else the engraved crosshatching in the bands
of the lower zone is broken by plain discs. Then, too, these bands
form arcs over the simulated flutes.
Simple designs--zigzags, herringbone, and meanders--done with
a fiber brush on a moist surface appear to be confined to pot forms.
Often there is no design, merely slight disconnected marks that
cover the body. Some of this work is what Harrington calls comb:ing.s A comb, though, should give more regular lines. Brushing
was used alone or with punctating, nodes and incising.
Punctations--"indentations done one at a time with the point of
a tool"9--run the gamut in Caddo decoration, forming complex as
well as elementa! patterns. Blunt and pointed twigs, reeds and
canes appear to have been the instruments used. It is difficult if
not impossible to determine whether some of the punctations were
done with a piece of cane or with the thumb nail. Moreover, the
punctation technique is responsible for a type of pseudo relief work,
done not by applique but by pushing or pinching the damp surface
into nodes, sometimes seen on conical bowls.
Although not confined to them, punctations are most common in
the decoration of pot forms. Some of the patterns are very distincPLATE 2

tive of these shapes, being composed of delicate indentations arranged linearly to form all-over designs--nested trinagles, alternate
right and left oblique-hatched triangles, diagonal cribbing, concentric arcs and pendant concentric half-ovals.~°

Many are so finely

done that at a glance they might be mistaken for fabric impressions.
Vessels decorated in this fashion are especially characteristic of
Western Clark County. (Plate III, Fig. b).
Lunar shaped punctations which appear to have been done with
half a cane and straight punctations done ~6th a spatulate shaped tool
are likewise typical of urns and pots. They are more common on the
Ouachita, Caddo and Little Missouri rivers than they are on the
Red. And the vessels from the Ouachita bearing this decoration are
usually much larger. The punctations may be the sole element,
repeated many times in the rim pattern; but more frequently they
are combined with incised meanders and diagonal hatching. (Plate
III, Fig. a). The same motifs may or may not be repeated on the
vessel body. Scrolls may take the place of meanders, or else the
diagonal hatching is increased, forming all-over, compact, rectilinear figures. The punctations are either arranged in parallel
rows or done at random to fill the spaces between other elements
when they are present. Occasionally they are the dominant motif,
closely spaced impressions being arranged in eurvilinear bands.
On some yes, Is the punctations form depressed meanders, the indentations having been deeply impressed in the clay below the other
motifs.
Moore illustrates three urns from the Foster Place, Lafayette
¯ County, which have designs cmnpo~d of plain scrolls separated
by incised U-shaped lines.11 These, as have been noted, somewhat
resemble certain Marksville patterns.12

In lny collection there are

three similar vessels from Clark County.~°

One has closely spaced

punctations.
The other two have indentations which were done
with a spatulate shaped tool, notched to make several indentations
whenever it was pressed into th.e clay. Webb and Dodd call this
technique Belcher Stamping.33

At the Belcher Mound, Caddo Par-

fish, La., they found bowls bearing spirals consisting of stamping
outlined by trailed lines.

As they point out, Moore illustrates a

pot from the Friday Place, Lafayette County, Arkansas, which has
a stamped band around the rim.~ z~ The decoration on the body is
brushed spirals. On Caddo vessels from Arkansas it is unusual to
find stamped motifs. Stamping was used to fill the background.
Stamping, insofar as I have observed on Caddo vessels from Arkansas, is confined to pots and urns.
Incising varies considerably. Some incised lines are fine enough
to be confused with engraving, whereas others are fairly wide
grooves polished somewhat like those of the Marksville.15 Incising was a common tectmique for decorating all shapes except the
neckless bottle. Most of the motifs which were executed in other
techniques were also incised. Generally, the rectilinear designs
occur more often on pot shapes while the scroll, meander and circle
are more abundant on bottles and bowls.
The most complex treatment of. the incised scroll is in the allover patterns where the scrolls are continuous or are connected by
curving lines. From Glendora, La.,16 northward to the headwaters
of the Ouachita, and in the Red River Valley, these patterns are
present on bottles that have a short bulbous neck. Whether or not
the elaborate incised scroll combinations were done with a comb
remains to be determined by measuring the grooves on the bottles.
Engraving was used principally on bottles and bowls and eccentric forms, most of which were highly polished. An engraved pot
is rare indeed. 17 The absence of engraving here cannot be explained
entirely on the grounds that it required too much labor to devote
to culinary vessels, for some of the previously discussed punctated
patterns would have been as difficult to do as engraving and would
have taken as much time.
Engraving enabled the potters to achieve certain effects which
could not be produced as easily by incising. Finer lines could be
made and the edges would be smoother. Crosshatching--difficult
to incise minutely- might have received stimulus from the
engraving.
Many engraved lines have spurs projecting from them.

lines do not have.

23

Webb and Dodd state: "The spurred line which

appears so often on Belcher Engraved and engraved wares from
other Caddo sites does not appear elsewhere in the Southeast or
Mississippi Valley area, so far as I can ascertain, but does appear
early in the Southwest (Mesa Verde, Mim~res) and again in Central
Mexico (Toltec)."18" Spurred lines were also painted on some Casas
Grandes vessels.19 Granting that spurred lines might have been
imported into the Caddo area, there is still a possibility that this
simple motif could have originated independently.

It is the sort

of element which a potter might develop while learning to engrave.
Incising is a freer process than engraving.

Soft clay naturally

yields more easily and quickly to an instrument than does clay at
the leather-hard stage and after it is baked. So a greater area could
be covered at one stroke and the resulting line would be more flowing. A skilled potter could easily incise a scroll or a meander at
one stroke without having to stop at the inflection and begin anew
in another direction.

Engraving a hard surface, on the other hand,

is often a piecemeal procedure, particularly when the design has
curves.

The graver may slip or thb surface may flake.

Working

under such difficulties, a Caddo potter might have decided to incorporate the ragged edges of lines into the design, and thus have
started a trait that was later used chiefly for its decorative effect.

Spurs were not limited to scrolls. They were used with circles
and rectangular motifs and are present on cazuelas and bottles of
various types. However, spurred scrolls and rectangles frequently
occur together with plain line engraving on a peculiar bottle shaped
somewhat like a pear, having a flat base, an elongated body and a
truncated conical neck. (Plate IV, Fig. b).
Engraved continuous scrolls, discs and hatching or crosshatching
are found in combination on semiglobular bowls (especially in the
Red River Valley) on cazuelas, intermediate form bowls and on
bottles. In most cases which I have observed, when they are all
present in bottle decorations the vessel has a globular body, a
rounded base and a bulbous neck.
The majority of the cazuelas were engraved. Others were incised,
or incised and punctated incised and engraved, or punctated and
engraved. To some extent, especially where the engraving technique
was used, the designs vary according to the shape of the bowls. There

24

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

are two main types of cazuelas: (1) A bowl having a rounded base
indistinguishable from the body and an inward sloping rim which
ends in a rounded or slightly flared lip. The height of the body is
usually greater than tile height of the rim. (2) A rather flat bowl with
less pronounced rounded body and a vertical or slightly concave rim
ending in a rounded or a decided flaring lip. The height of the body
is equal to or less than that of thc rim.
The first type, as has already been mentioned, sometimes has
nodes applied en mass to the rim. Incised designs appear to have
been more frequently used on this form also. Engraved designs
were not always confined to the rim, the base being covered with
an all-over pattern usually composed of motifs similar to those on
the rim.
Engraved scrolls, continuous or broken, with discs and hatching
or crosshatching filling the interspaces, are customary motifs on the
rim. On the base four continuous scrolls are commonly arranged
around a circle engraved on the very bottom of the vessel, and the
background is treated in the same fashion as on the rim.
In Arkan~s the second type of cazuela ordinarily lacks basal
decoration as is found on vessels at GIendora, La.2° Scrolls and
spirals again occur on the rim. Motifs, likewise common, are a keyshaped figure which might have been derived by conventionalizing
the spiral, and a motif resembling a link composed of two parallel
bands separated by a line. When the latter is used all the background is generalIy cro~hatched. These two motifs appear to be
confined to cazuelas.
Scrolls, spirals, or keys occur with concentric circles--all having
a common horizontal axis---on rims of cazuelas, an arrangement
which appears to have been avoided in the decoration of bottles.
Confinement of the pattern to the narrow rim band might well be the
explanation. Certainly the scrolls and spirals, keys and links are
elongated in pa~terns on the rim.
Necessity may have been responsible in the first place.

Yet, there

Plate 3

Decoration and Form of Arkansas Caddo Pottery

is evidence of a definite artistic convention at work.

27

On cazuelas

of the first type which have a narrow rim the principal motifs
extend from the shoulder to the lip.

But on the second type, which

has the wider rim, the space occupied by the dominant motifs is further narrowed by the addition of one or more lines parallel and
just below the lip.

(Plate IV, Fig. a).

Two art styles are evident in Caddo pottery, represented at their
extremes by the smoothed, incised pots bearing rectilinear motifs
and punctations, and the polished bulbous necked bottles and cazuelas having engraved scroll designs with crosshatching and discs.
Tradition is always an important force in art both as a negative and
as a positive factor. On one hand it sets standards for the conservative artist to meet while on the other hand it pricks the rebel to
develop a new style. In civilized art circles these two aspects carry
on a continuous tug of war. In a primitive society where art was
not divorced from industry and religion one might expect a more
intense struggle between the old and the new. Age and habit would
nip novelty’s heels. The new would be shadowed by the old. That
is what happened in the Caddo country.
Judge Harry J. Lemley and I suggested in 1939 that the engraved
pottery represented an intrusion into the indigenous incised ware
area.Z l Webb and Dodd proved it in 1941 by making a stratigraphic
study of pottery and house types at thd Belcher Mound, La.ZZ
They found incised straight line and punctated wares followed by
steadily increasing engraved, brushed and ridged wares. The
Srnithport Inclsed-Punctate which predominated on the first level
bears some resemblance to the decoration of pot forms from the
Ouachita area of Arkansas. Many of the latter, however, have curvilinear motifs combined "with punctations and rectilinear motifs.
Foster Trailed-Incised and Belcher Stamped, the decorative types
most closely ~-esembling Marksville, were coeval with Belcher
Engraved. In other words, these two types had sufficient tradition
back of them to survive despite the growing popularity of engraving: The patterns were stitl associated with an old form.
Even a brief examination of Caddo pottery.reveals designs associated with specific shapes. Evidently artistic conventions recognized by the group and backed by tradition governed individual potters when choosing designs and techniques. When a detailed statis-

SOME EXPERIMENTS IN THE USE
OF THE ATLATL
BY

J. WALKER DAVENPORT

It was my good fortune to be a member of the Witte Memorial
Museum’s expedition of June, 1933, to the West Texas area. It was
on this expedition that I first learned of the weapon known as the
atlatl. We then found several handle and distal ends of atlatls, but
unfortunately did not find any complete specimens. My questions
regarding this weapon and its use went unanswered, so, for the
time I dropped the subject.
While making the drawings for the Museum’s Bulletin I was again
reminded of it and decided then to make an atlatl at the first available opportunity and try it out.

Sometime later when the opportun-

ity arrived the only piece of wood available was one of yellow pine
and this was used. The distal end of the atlatl was patterned after
the portion deseribed in the Witte Museum Bulletin No. 2.

The

handle was shaped somewhat along the lines of one found in the
Shumla Caves.

Having no idea as to what the length of the atlatl

should be and as the piece of wood was twenty-four inches long I
made it of that length.

There was a groove in the face of the

original atlad and ahhough its purpo~ was a mystery, I included
it in my model. Talks with a number of archaeologists regarding
this groove brought no explanation as most of them seemed to have
given it very little thought.
The completed atlatl and a commercial twenty-eight arrow were
taken out into the patio for a trial.

Having had no instruction in the

use of this weapon, a good bit of experimenting had to be done to
find the proper handgrip. A grip was found that seemed to answer
the purpose and a trial throw was made. Plate 5, figures 1 and 2.
The shaft went straight up in the air af~d at the same time turned end
for end.

Different holds and releases were tried with little success.

The shaft still turned end for end.

Unable to control the flight of

this arrow and believing it to be due to the short length, a search
PLATE 5
Illustrating method of gripping the atlatl.

Plate 5

Some Experiments in the Use of the Atlatl
started for a longer one.

33

A light javelin in the possession of Mr.

A. K. Boyles, the Museum taxidermist, seemed to suit the requirements.

The first try with this produced astonishing results. The flight
was true and the shaft struck with terrific force. In a very short time
I was hitting within a three-feet circle at a distance of about eighty
paces.
It was at this time that a reason for the groove suggested itself.
It is rather difficult, when in a hurry, to hold the atlatl in one hand
with about eighteen inches protrudging, and the arrow in the other
with an equal distance or more protruding and try to fit the hock to
the hook. By using the first and second fingers of the atlatl hand
as a guide, Plate 5, figure 3, the nock end of the shaft can be. quickly
dropped into the grove and slid up to the hook, where it automatically
and properly hocks itself. Plate 5, figure 4. My use of this groove
may or may not have been the original reason for its being there but
it fuIfills this purpose beautifully.
Several years of odd-time experimentation have revealed the following facts:
1. The shaft projected with the atlatl does not have the speed
and snap of one driven by the bow, but the heavier weight of the
shaft more than makes up for what it lacks in speed. I completely
ruined the bark on the side of a hackberry tree at eighty paces using
a bunt point.
2. For best results the shaft should be at least forty and not over
~venty-two inches long.
3. A rather heavy point seems to add to, rather than subtract
from the shaft’s ability to hold a true flight.
4. When properly balanced, feathering is not essential, but
cleaner flights can be had if three feathers about six inches in
length are used.
5. The weight is not so important, as long as it stays within limits
of a rather wide range. This range would vary somewhat with individuals. The greater the weight, the greater the shocking power
but, after a certain point in weight the shorter the flight. My

34

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

experiments have as yet, been too limited to ascertain if standard
rules could be worked out for this, but I believe that they can.
I have experimented with shafts of the following weight. 1½ oz.,
length 49 inches; flight fair, distance average 75 yards. 31,~ oz.,
length 60~ inches; flight excellent; distance average 148 yards. I
have not yet had the opportunity of trying this shaft in real open
spaces so am unable to say at this time what the final distance
may be. 9½ oz., length 71½ inches; flight excellent; distance 110
yards. There is no doubt but that practice to develop the proper
throwing arm would increase these distances, still, I am inclined to
believe the relation between t-hem would remain about the same.
6. The length of the atlatl again allows some variation. I have
tried atlatls with over-all lengths as follows: 16½, 24, 30, and 36
inches. Of these the 24 inch model seemed to give the best results.
The 36 inch model seemed too long for accurate throwing and
with the heavier shafts offered too much resistance. The strain
on the hand and fingers being much too great for consistent practice.
The 16½ inch model on the other hand, offered so little resistance
that the feel of the shaft was lost, resulting in loss of accuracy.
This was more pronounced when throwing the light shafts. If
however, the shaft .weight was a pound or more, then the short
model would give better results than the longer ones. Thus the
weight of the shaft governs the length of the atlatl.
The atlatl took many forms among the aborigines of what is now
the North American Continent.

The groove is more or less present

on them all. The hook assumed many shapes as each individual
made his revisions and improvements. The handles suffered somewhat the same fate.

On many, two finger holes were carefully

carved in the handle, on others one finger hole and a thumb groove.
Some types consisted simply of two finger grooves while others
included loops of rawhide for the finger grip. Two shallow hocks
for the first and second fingers are all that are necessary.

Objects

bound to the atlatl which served as fetishes, balance weights or
both have been reported by several writers. I have experimented
with balance stones of varying weights at various positions on the
PLATE 6
Illustrating method of throwing with atlatl.

Plate 6

Some Experiments in the Use o] the Atlatl

37

atlatl but was unable to detect any advantage or any special disadvantage.

It is possible that balance weights were used only in

special cases with specific types of shafts and as I have not run
the entire gauntlet of shaft types and weights my findings are not
concIusive.
In use, the atlatl is held in the throwing hand with the first and
second fingers inserted through the fingernocks-or loops and the
third and fourth fingers holding the handle butt firmly against the
palm of the hand. Plate 5, figures 1 and 2. Held in this manner
a straight hinge movement of the wrist is possible. The shaft is
then hocked to the hook and the first finger is pressed firmly against
the face of the atlatl and the shaft lowered across the top of this
finger. The thumb and second fingers are then brought up to a
firm grip on the shaft. Plate 5, figures 5 and 6. This completes
the hand grip. The throw takes the form of a straight overhand lob,
with a snap wrist action at the end of the movement. The arm is
carried over and back with the shaft projecting past the ear and
approximately parallel to the ground. Plate 6, figure 1. As the
throw starts pressure of the thumb and second finger against the
shaft is released. The exact point of the release varies with the
distance of the target etc., however, after a few throws this release
is accomplished at the correct point with no conscious thought and
effort on the part of the thrower. Just before the end of the forward arm movement, the wrist which has been steadily bending back
to keep the shaft in line, Plate 6, figure !, 2 and 3, is brought forward with a snap, adding many yards and much power to the throw.
Plate 6, figure 4, and 5. The other arm is used as a balance, held
out in front of the body at the beginning of the throw and carried
around to the rear as the throwing arm moves forward. In this
way balance is maintained on long, hard throws. It is of some use
even on short, easy throws
Aiming is accomplished simply by looking at the target.

It is

absolutely necessary to concentrate on the object to be hit, because
if the eye wanders, so does the shaft.

Flint and Metal Points Overlapped

In the majority of historic references to arrowpolnts, mention is
made that they were metal. Sometimes they are described merely
as arrowheads. Some of these may have been stone.

4O

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

Herman Lehmann,1 among the Comanches and Apaches from 1870
to 1879, states:
~ ~ ~ "We first used flint rock for spikes. ~ ~ ~ Later when the
soldiers began to come onto the plains, we found old barrel hoops
and other steel around their camp; and from this we made steel
spikes and discarded our old flint rock spikes."
The use of flint was not entirely abandoned for some time after
hoop iron and other metals were secured. I know of several graves
that contained trade articles and flint points.
Chronology o] Metal Points
The use of metal projectile points represents a short but colorful
phase of the Indians’ losing struggle to dominate his hunting
grounds.

How long were metal projectile points used in Texas?

In small numbers, they appeared during the mission period from
1659 to 1800.

Between 1800 and 1845 traders were instrumental in placing many
mental points in the hands of the Indians. These traders were
"bringing up to date" the precedent set by Cabeza de Vaca,2 who
listed among his articles of barter "flint for arrowpoints, glue and
hard canes wherewith to make them."
Available records concerning the activities of certain traders in
Texas make no mention of metal arrowpoi.nts being stocked along
with Jewsharps, steels for lighting fire, etc. But much of his stock,
such as flour, brown sugar, molasses, whiskey, etc., came in barrels.
The barrels were encircled by sheet iron hoops that made excellent
arrowpoints.

titian on the Brazos River west of the Bexar-Nacogdoches road,
ordered goods from merchants at Brazoria.

A~nong other articles

were two barrels of sugar, fire steels, pocket knives, large awls,
axes and "tomahawks."

The Indians not only used the hoop iron,

but probably converted some of the other articles into projectile
points. A broken blade from a pocket knife is known to have been
made into a lance head.
Materials for metal points became much more plentiful between
1845 and 1875.

By the latter date bows and arrows were largely

replaced by firearms, secured from the whites.

A number of years ago the writer examined a small burned rock
hearth near the site of a soldiers’ camp. In the hearth were three
hoop iron arrowpoints and a snubnose end scraper made of bottle
glass. The glass was like that in many bottles at the soldiers’ camp.
The camp was occupied by U. S. cavalry from 1879 to 1882, during
the time the Apaches were giving trouble in Southwest Texas. It
thus ~ems that the metal points may have been contemporaneous
with the soldiers’ camp.
Manu[acture o] Metal Points
The ~naking of metal arrowpoints was comparatively easy.
times they were made by others and traded to the Indians.

SomeAgain

the Indians did the work.
Some trading posts and early settlements had blacksmith shops.
In the shop it was a simple matter to manufacture arrowpoints from
hoop iron, and lance points from worn-out files, broken knife and
sword blades.
Jeff Smith,4 in recounting his boyhood experiences as a captive,
states that Mexican traders brought with them "iron or steel arrow
spikes ready made. All we had to do was to fit them on the dogwood shaft and sharpen them." He adds that the Mexicans on other
visits brought "steel with which to make arrowpoints. * * * The
arrival of the steel in our camp caused a lot of work, for we were
soon busy making bows and arrows."
Ira making hoop iron points the Indians used a small hammerstone
for bending and breaking the -hoop into narrow strips. If short
points were desired, a strip might be broken in two, but in most

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

44

cases the length of the point was governed by the width of the
barrel hoop.
The strips were worked into shape and sharpened with a file--a
treasured tool often secured by theft, sometimes by barter. Lehmann
says the Mexicans furnished "files with which to fashion and sharpen
Ollr arrows."

Another source of hoop iron was revealed by Smith:

"In slipping around through the white settlements the Indians
would pick up aIl the hoop iron they could find, and would use this
in making their arrowspikes."
Several writers say barbed points were used for war, leaf-shaped
ones for hunting. Marcy5 mentions triangular points of iron attached to arrows 20 inches long.
The Handbook6 states that war arrows had heads loosely attached,
to remain in the flesh when the shafts were withdrawn and rankle in
the wounds. Cases discussed later seemed to bear out this statement.

The hunting points were firmly secured, and thus more

easily recovered for subsequent use.

Mason7 declares that foreshafted arrows of the South and Southwest were loosely put together. This is verified by a statement of
Lehmann that one of his periodical duties as a captive servant was
to "tighten the spikes" on the chief’s arrows.
Bows, ,4 rrows, Qtdvers and S]delds

Various sources throw light on the materials used by the Texas
Indians in making their weapons. John W. Hunter,8 Lehmann,
Smith and others, mention arrows of dogwood. There are other
references to arrows made of pecan branches, and to some of river
reeds.
Bows of bois d’arc, or Osage orange, about five feet long--some
shortermfrequently are mentioned. Some bows were made of wild
mulberry, a few of mesquite and other woods.
Quivers were made of smoked deerskin; of calf or panther hide,
each quiver holding about 250 arrows.9 Still others were of lynx
hide.

Indian Arrow and Lance Wounds

45

The common material for shields was the thick part of bull buffalo hides, stretched over hickory hoops and sewed with thongs.
There often was a cover of deerskin.

According to John W. Hunter,lo the whites learned to not shoot
at a shield, "as it would be useless waste of ammunition; but to
always take aim at the hips, the legs or the lower part of the
abdomen, just below the lower rim of the shield."
!lccttrate Shooting With Bow and zIrrow

The Indians, at close range, were more accurate with bows and
arrows than with firearms. They had been trained since childhood
to shoot the bow, while some had only recently come into possession
of guns.
As an example of the accuracy of an Indian boy’s aim, we are
told that they "could hit a small coin placed in a split stick at a
distance of 20 yards."

Even the women often became expert with the bow and arrow.
Squaws sometimes inflicted serious wounds. Miller ~ tells of a
Comanche woman, in 1868, shooting him in the right cheek "with au
arrow that protruded from behind the ear."
Abundance o] Arrows

At times a band of Indians might have few arrows and use them
sparingly. Again arrows were plentiful and used freely.
In an engagement, January, 1851, between 14 Comanches and eight
Texas Rangers under Lieut. Ed Burleson, "the ground was literally
covered with arrows. Over 200 were picked up on a space less than
one-fourth acre."~2
In 1862 a young lady in Gillespie County, Texas, was attacked by
Indians as she left a spring near her home.

The account reads:

"She was riddled with arrows.’’13

February, 1863, witnessed another encounter in the same county.
Two settIers were hunting for oxen when attacked by a band of
Indians. One of the men, mounted on a fleet horse, made his
escape. The other, riding a slow mule, had to dismount and seek

46

Texas A~’cheological and Paleontological Society

shelter behind a tree. His arrow-pierce body was found the following day. Mueller1’~ sums up the situation:
"Not less than 83 arrows had been shot at him, that many being
lodged in the tree * * * in the ground nearby, and in his body,which was struck over 40 times. * * * The Indians left hurriedly
without taking their own dead with them. Arhelger’s * * * right
hand was shot full of arrows, but his left hand still grasping the
six-shooter, with which he had held the Indians back until his
ammunition was gone. One of the arrows had struck him in the
back of the neck."

In January, 1868, 15 Comanches--from a reservation in the Indian Territory--attacked two settlers in San Saba County, Texas.
W. J. Miller and A. W. Morrow, with a four-horse team, were re.
turning from a water mill. They were armed wi~h two dragoon
pistols. Miller, who received 23 arrow wounds, says:
"The Indians, in their excitement, had shot away most of their
arrows. The chuck box, fastened to the end of the wagon, bristled
like a porcupine. I believe that a double armful of arrows were
sticking in the wagon and ground."

Penetrating Power o] Arrows

Arrows, under favorable conditions, had remarkable penetrating
power. The extent to which they might penetrate, when shot from
a given bow, was influenced by several factors:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Force wiah which shot.
Distance from object shot.
Resistance of wind and of the substance struck.
Loss of power, due to wet bowstrings, etc.
Size, shape and sharpness of arrowpoint.

The force with which an arrow was propelled sometimes was
altered by war conditions. An Indian, while shooting arrows, was
wounded by a gunshot. He continued for several minutes discharging arrows, but the missies came with less and less force until he
finally fell dead.
PLATE 8
h MUTE STORY OF TRAGEDY

The remains of the arrow-pierced skeleton of a man and the
carcass of his horse tell of a tragic end, such as often befell one who
traveled alone.
Arrows that killed a man were not used again.

Plate

49

Where the target was too distant the arrow spent much of its force
before striking. A man was shot from a distance of more than 150
yards. The arrow struck him in the stomach but barely broke the
skin. On one occasion the attacking Indians were too close for their
arrows to acquire sufficient speed to be deadly. The most effective
range was from 50 to 75 yards.
Lehmann says when their bowstrings became wet they often built
a fire to dry them. In one fight "’the Comanches made the re:rows
fly, but their bowstrings were wet from rain and they could not
shoot with much force."
The penetrating power of arrows was well displayed by the depth
to which they sank in woods of various kinds. In one case arrows
penetrated an oak tree for ~ore than two inches. In 1858, according
to Franks,15 Indians put 18 arrows into a tree behind which William
Clements was standing. It is not stated how deeply the arrows
,penetrated.
Captain John G. Bourke,16 says Apaches in the mountains of
Arizona in 1871 shot a number of arrows at whites, and that two of
them penetrated pine trees to a depth of six inches.
But a thin piece of wood might act as a protector for an individual.
Mrs. Thompson of Hays County, Texas, tells of an arrow that struck
a woman, but was deflected by a wooden stave in her home-made
corset.
In several cases individuals actually were shot through the body,
but sometimes they only thought they were. Lineeum 17 quotes
Charles Milburn, a former soldier at Fort Davis as saying:
* * * "Berg Johnson was driving a stage. The Indians * * *
killed a couple of passengers, but Berg managed to escape in the
hills, finally making his way to the army post. They had him up
here trying to cut an arrow out of his chest. Berg kept cursing
and telling them to get it out on the other side, as it had gone clear
through him. * * * The surgeon turned him over; and sure enough
there was an arrow sticking out of his back. But it hadn’t gone
through him; it was another arrow."
A, W. Morrow had an arrow strike him in the left ear; and,
while Miller was pulling it out, another penetrated his right ear.
Miller adds: "He could see both shafts and imagined that one

5O

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

arrow had passed entirely through his head.
that he was killed."

He groaned and said

Even pointed wooden arrows, without a separate head, sometimes
were fatal.

Mason rays: "in July, 1870, * ~ ~ M. T. Kennedy was

mortally wounded by an Apache arrow which pierced his chest.
The autopsy disclosed the fact that the arrow had no head."

Arrows frequently penetrated bone. Miller relates: * ~ ~ "’Another hit me squarely in the middle of the chest, sticking in the bone
and standing out as straight as if it had been shot in-a tree."
Mason quotes Oliver Maicy as saying:
"I have * * * the sixth dorsal vertebra of a btfffalo, the spine
of which contains an iron arrowpoint.

The arrow * * * penetrated

the bone, .82 of an inch. * * * The animal was mature and the
bones ~vell ossified. * * * The arrow must have penetrated several
inches of fiesh"~as well as the thick hide and matted hair--"before striking the bone."

A number of writers relate that iron-tipped arrows sometimes were
shot through the body of a large buffalo.
accounts of arrows going through a horse.

There also are a few

In an engagement soldiers had with Comanches in 1856, Bugler
Tofolla had an overcoat rolled and tied on the front of his saddle.
An arrow struck the roll, making about 50 holes in the thick coat,
then entered the soldier’s body just at the hip bone. The wound was
slight. ~ s

"the wild tribes living in the drainage of the Rio Grande could
pierce a coat of mail with their arrows."
Lehmann declares that arrows would not penetrate negro skulls;
and that he once heard a chief instruct his warriors not to shoot
negro soldiers in the head, as a "buffalo soldier’s" head was too
hard and would turn the arrows.
Pro]ectil¢ Points Remain in Wounds
It was not uncommon for an iron projectile point to become
detached from the shaft and remain embedded in the flesh. Some that
required special attention will be discussed later. Other cases are

Indian Arrow and Lance Wounds

considered here.
of points:

51

There were several causes of this detachment

1. Point loosely attached to shaft for that purpose.
2. Point struck bone, causing the tip of hoop-iron point
to bend back.
3. Shaft hastily jerked out.
4. Shaft broken by a~cident, or purposely cut off to get
out of way.
Frequently points struck a rib, femur or other bone and curved
back, or "bradded," so that an unusually strong pull was required
for removal. The head often became detached. Even when the
point was not bent, a sudden jerk often resulted in bringing out the
shaft without the head.
Cross19 tells of a settler near old Fort Gates who, about 1854,
was shot in the foot with an arrow. He was dismounted and struck
his foot against a bush, breaking the arrow a few inches above the
met~l point. The point remained in his foot for about eight hours.
Gray2° relates an unusual incident. At the Salt Creek fight,
May 16, 1869, George Lemley was wounded in the eyebrow with
an arrow. The point remained in his head. He is said to have blown
the arrowpoint out through his nose 10 years later.
In telling of a Comanche raid into Kerr County, Texas, in 1857,
Sowel121 states:
"William Kelso was shot * * * through the small of the back with
an arrow, but jerked it out, and shooting an Indian down he made
his escape into the brush. * * * He did not notice * * * that the spike
failed to come with the shaft. For 20 years the wound would not
heal, until by a surgical operation the ’iron arrowhead was discovered and removed. The wound then ’healed.’.’
In discussing the numerous wounds he received, Miller declares:
"I carried a steel barb in my right thigh till 1874 (six years),
when Dr. Dowell at Galveston removed it. * * * In pulling an arrow
from my left side, the head slipped from the shaft and remained
in my lung. It is still there." This was in 1901, 33 years after
the battle. "Surgeons in Kansas City," he continued, "located the
arrowhead with an X-ray. machine, but declined to remove it, say-

52

Texas ArcheoIogical and Paleontological Society

ing that the operation would be more dangerous than to allow the
arrowhead to remain."

~4r.rowheads Pinning Men to Saddle, Etc.
Arrows sometimes "nailed down" their victims. In 1851 a pioneer
raised his carbine to fire at an Indian. An arrow struck his right
forefinger, passed through the last joint and penetrated the breech
of his gun. The wood splintered, releasing his hand.
In July, 1857, Lieut. John B. Hood and 25 men of the 2nd Cavalry, with an Indian guide and supplies for 30 days, left Fort
Mason on a scouting trip. After 12 days an Indian trail was
struck, and the chase began. It lasted three days, ending in a battle
near Devils River, not far from the Rio Grande. The battle, at
close range, was very fierce. Lieut. Hood22 writes of his wound
as follows:
* * * "I was pierced in the left hand with an arrow, which passed
through the reins and fourth finger, pinning my hand to the bridle.
I instantly broke the spearhead and threw it aside. Unmindful
of the fact that the feather could not pass through the wound, I
pulled the arrow in the direction it had been shot; and was compelled finally, in order to free myself of it, ~ seize the feathers
in lieu of the barbed end." * * *

Deaton, quoted by Holmes,23 gives an interesting account of a
happening in Comanche County, Texas, in the winter of 1864:
"Don Cox was wounded in a fight with Indians.

An arrow struck

him in the thigh, going through and completely pinning his leg
to the skirts of his saddle. * * * ]:)on was getting very sick and
blinded with pain. * * * They were compelled to * * * dismount
and extract the arrow.
* * * This they did by cutting off the
spike on the inside and then drawing the arrow out the way it
went in." * * *

Under command of Colonel. R. S. Mackenzie, U. S. troops in September, 1872, attacked and destroyed Mow-wis Comanche village
of over 250 lodges. Other engagements took place on the North
Fork of Red River and elsewhere in the Texas Panhandle. In one
of these, Sergeant J. B. Charlton, .~.th Cavalry, received a aevere
arrow wound in his leg. Captain R. G. Carter~4 says:
* * * "One of these arrows pierced Charlton’s thigh, midway between hip and knee, going through the saddle leather and pinning

Indian Arrow and Lance Wounds

53

him to the saddle. * * * When he reached the Command, his leg was
so swollen that his trousers had to be cut away. I-Ie could not dismount until the doctor lifted his leg away from the saddle, cut
off the barb of the arrow and removed the shaft." * * *

Taboo Against Arrows That Killed Men
There seems to have been a Comanche--and perhaps an Apache
--taboo against using arrows stained with human blood. Lehmann
declares that the band with which he was a captive "never used an
arrow the second time which had killed a man, enemy or friend."
Poisonee~ Arrows
Although an occasional reference is made to poisoned arrows,
their use in Texas is hazy. Brainard,z6 in 1854, in the Nature
and Cure o] Bite o] Serpents and Wounds o] Poisoned Arrows, states:
"Dr, George Johnson * * * told me that several tribes of Indians on the Rio Grande employ the venom of the serpent for this
purpose and that there is a species known to them which have the
vesicles receiving the venom so large as to contain a quantity sufficient to poison a great number of arrows.
"There is reason to believe that the poison used by the Indian
tribes on their arrows is, in many cases, nothing else than the
venom of the serpent preserved in a peculiar manner. * * *
’"The plan of treatment which I recommend for the bite of serpents and wounds from poisoned arrows is: 1--To wash the part
with a solution of iodine and iodide of potassium, and apply cupping glasses over the wound, or ligatures around the member, so
as to prevent absorption. 2--If the wound be deep, or if absorption has already taken place, I recommend injecting the solution
under the skin, beneath the cupping glass, and disseminating it by
friction about the wound." * * *

Mason in 1893 said arrow poisoning was a "vexed" problem: some
saying it Was not practiced; others, including Captain Bourke, insisting that it was practiced. Mason accepts Bourke’s account and
adds: "The toxic effect of putrid flesh was known, whether or not
bitten freely by rattlesnakes."
Outstanding among Texas references is the statement of Lehmann :
"In a separate quiver we carried a few poisoned arrows to use in
battle. The venom of the rattlesnake was used on these spikes."
I have found no record of anyone on the Texas frontier being

54

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

wounded by a poisoned arrow. It is possible that some of the "instant" deaths were hastened by poisoning. But an arrow through
the heart did not need to be poisoned. It also is possible that the
sickness and vomiting mentioned in certain cases may have been
aggravated by poison. Most such wounds were not fatal.
Stabbing With Arrows and Lances

Projectile points sometimes were used for stabbing and cutting.
Such use was facilitated by having the double-edged metal points
very sharp. There are references to sharpening arrowpoints, and
to "a point as long as the finger and sharp as a knife."
Marcy relates an incident that happened, prior to 1854, along the
Rio Grande near Laredo, Texas. Lieutenant Hudsou with a detachment of soldiers had overtaken a band of Indians in an arroyo.
Being unable to escape, they fought desperately, severa! attempting
to kill the lieutenant.
"One," Marcy says, "approached him very close and discharged
several arrows at him, when the lieutenant rar~ and seized him by
the hair of the head and attempted to cut him down with his saber.
But unfortunately the arm was so dull that he was unable to inflict
much injury upon him; and the savage turned upon him with an
arrow, and stabbed him so severely that he died in a few days."

In August, 1865, after stripping and ravishing a white woman
they had captured, six Comanches cut her body with lance thrusts
and made a long gash in her abdomen.
Lances and Their Uses

Lances played a prominent part in many encounters. The lance,
often referred to as a spear, was one of the favorite weapons of the
plains Indians. Lances ranged in length from five to 14 feet.
Walter Hough, in the Handbook, states that "the plains Indians,
whenever possible, used two distinct varieties for war and for hunting, the hunting lance blade being shorter and heavier." The war
lance, with its metal blade, was standard equipment on Comanche
expeditions; and was intimately associated with the horse.
I have seen three steel lance points, found in historic Indian sites.
They were five to eight inches long and la/~ to 2a/~ inches wide.
One was made of an old file; another from a butcher knife; and

Indian Arrow and Lance Wounds

55

the third, the end of a sword blade. They had rounded shoulders
and no barbs. The stems were long, probably because the weight
of the point required deep insertion to make it secure.
Writers mention lance shafts of ashwood and of hickory.
woods probably were used.

Other

In most cases the lance was not thrown but used in the hand.
When thrown, it was for short distances. ’
Catlin27 tells of a swift Kiowa man, seven feet tall, who ran
alongside a buffalo and killed it with a lance. The Handbook mentions a Kiowa lance in the U. S. National Museum that is headed
with a sword blade and reported to have killed 16 enemies.
Major George H. Thomas,a8 summer of 1860, set out from Camp
Cooper and scouted for several weeks. Finally a fresh Indian trail
was ~ound and chase given. Closely pursued, a warrior in the rear
dismounted and began to fight a delaying action, that other members of his band might escape. The gritty warrior, wounded by 20
or more shots, rallied and rushed with drawn lance upon a dismounted soldier. Only a slight wound was inflicted. He then
struck a bugler in the left breast.
In August, 1865, a white man was shot with an arrow, then killed
by driving a lance through his back. Comanches committed the act.
In 1866, while on the ill-fated Schnively expedition, Colonel W. C.
Dalrymple received a lance wound in his arm just below the
shoulder. His assailant tried without success to withdraw the lance.
¯ Dalry~nple’s gun and pistols empty, he ran with the lance dangling
from his arm. Six Indians pursued him, while two white men followed them. After the Indians gave up the chase, the whites released the dangling lance and tied up the wound with a soiled
handkerchief.
In 1873 an elderly lady in Bandera County, Texas, was killed by
Comanches, who struck her between the shoulders with a lance.
The sharp steel head passed through her body and protruded from
her breast. Her slayers left the lance in her body and failed to
scalp her.
Gibson29 gives a good description of this lance.

The head, made

56

Texas Archeologlcal and Paleontological Society

of a piece of steel about a foot long and 11/~2 inches wide at the
base, tapered to a sharp double-edged point. Just below the stem
were two barbs. The point was imbedded in the end of a seasoned
hickory shaft about four feet long, making a total leng’th .of five
feet.
In the plains area the lance became an accessory of ceremonies,
and underwent a change from utilitarian to ceremonial weapon.
It seems the Comanches had a less disfiguring punishment than
the Apaches for infidelity among d~eir women. Instead of cutting
off the nose, the Comanche husband punished the offending wife
by inflicting wounds in her feet. Prior to securing firearms, the
man dashed a sharp lance into one foot of the woman. Later the
lance was carried in the ceremony, but the wound a~tually inflicted
by firing a rifle ball through the woman’s crossed feet. Marcy gives
an account of such a ceremony, related to him by Jim Ned, a Delaware Indian for whom a Texas stream was named.
Damage to Indian Weapons

Bows, arrows and even shields sometimessuffered from the gunfire of whites. One account tells of a bullet cutting a bow in two
near its middle. In June, 1860, six cowboys engaged a number of
Comanches. Bows, bowstrings and arrows were damaged. With a
shotgun, George W. Baylor split a bow from end to end.
According to Allen,3° in January, 1869~ there was a fight in
which the arm loops of a shield were cut by bullets. The shield
was dropped.
White Versus Indian Weapons

Cross declares that prior to 1860 five well armed white men could
defeat 30 Indians armed only with bows and arrows. Perhaps overstated, there is some truth in what he says. But a few years later

the situation was very different, the plains Indians being as well
armed as the white settlers and soldiers.

Often they were better

armed.

There are numerous references in 1868 and 1869 to the Comanches,
Apaches and Kiowas being armed with fine rifles and an abundance of ammunition. Yet they carried their bows and arrows. When
the ammunition was exhausted they discarded the pistols and began
shooting with bows and arrows.
In a battle with raiding reservation Indians in July, 1870, the
whites had two killed and 14 wounded. Only one man, McConnel132
relates, was hit by an arrow, the others being struck by balls from
large caliber rifles.
O[]icers Received Arrow Wounds

Many of the officers stationed at the frontier posts received arrow
wounds. Several of these, including Lieut. Hood,33 and Maj. G. H.
Thomas, have been mentioned.
Major Earl Van Dorn34 of the 2nd Cavalry was seriously
wounded on October 1, 1858, in a battle with Comanches. Eleven
days later he wrote his wife:
* * * "My first wound was in the left arm; the arrow entered lust
above the wrist, passed between the two bones and stopped near
the elbow. The second was in my body; the arrow entered opposite the ninth rib on the right side, passed through the upper portion of the stomach, cut my left lung, and passed out on the left
side between the sixth and seventh ribs. * * * I killed the Indian
that shot me. * * * I gasped in dreadful agony for several hours,
but finally became easy?’ * * *

Captain Jenkins3~ relates how Lieut. Van Camp received a death
wound in the same engagement. "In his left hand was the fatal
arrow, which he had pulled from his heart in the unconscious moment that preceded his death.’"
In October, 1871, in a skirmish with Indians in the Texas Paiahandle, Col. R. S. Mackenzie was wounded by an arrow. According
to Captain Carter, he was taken to Fort Richardson in an ambulance.
Turner36 says he saw "Mackenzie shot through the leg with an
arrow. A soldier standing near ~ ~ ~ pulled the arrow from his leg,
and promptly Mackenzie shot the Indian."

Care of the Wounded
Many of those wounded in fights with Indians received belated
and ohen inadequate treatment. This was unavoidable. Seemingly
~rious wounds sometimes gave little trouble, while some that appeared to be trivial proved fatal.
Lieut. Maury37 tells of the unusual arrow wound received by
Captain Vau Buren.

On the seventh day it proved fatal.

"It seemed a mere incision, so slight that neither Van Buren nor
t,he surgeon felt any anxiety about it. He was sitting up, laughing
and talking * * * when an artery burst and he died in a
minutes."
A noteworthy instance of rapid recovery of what at first seemed
a serious case was that of a soldier, named Mattock, at Fort Chadbourne in September, 1854. Major General David S. Stanley3a in
his Personal Memoirs, relates the case. Col. M. L. Crimmins 39,
and Captain R. G. Carterz~ make available additional information.
General Stanley says:
"Lieut. George B. Anderson and myself occupied one room in
the unfinished hospital. * * * We were both awakened by some
strange noise like someone groaning and calling. Going out we
found a soldier * * * who was just being helped to the hospita! * *
Mattock had been over the creek to the hut of a Dutchman who
sold liquor. Having filled up, he was on his way home * * * and
at the crossing of the creek, which was in deep banks, five" or six
Comanches waylaid him, and as he passed commenced shooting at
his back with bows and arrows. Mattock shouted and ran until he
met with the soldier * * * who brought him * * * to the hospital.
¯ * * Mattock had 14 arrows in him. * * * Three of these arrows
had gone so far through him that the surgeon extracted them by
cutting off the feathered part of the arrows and pulling them
through the man’s body. In two weeks time Mattock was walking
around, and his only disability was finally from a superficial wound,
which had lacerated a nerve. Assistant Surgeon Eben Swift, ~vho
treated this man, said he feared a truthful relation of the case would
result in his being put down a Munchausen. I relate this case
to show that arrow wounds do not compare with those made by
bullets in fatality."
As told by Captain Carter, Assistant Surgeon Swift saved the
arrows whicb he extracted frmn Mattock.
"At the opening of the Civil War in 1861, upon being ordered to
Council Bluffs, Iowa, and from thence to Hannibal, Missouri, the

Indian Arrow and Lance Wounds

61

freight car in which the family was traveling was set on fire by
the Confederates, and these Comanche arrowsmso long packed away
as surgical curios--were burned."

After Lieut. Ed Burleson and his band of Rangers had a fight
with Comanches, a courier was sent to Laredo for ambulances.
Several men were unable to ride on horseback. They reached For~
McIntosh the following day. Captain Sidney Burbank saw that
the wounded had proper care.
From the site near Devils River where Lieut. Hood’s men made
their stand, the wounded were taken, after a delay, to Camp Hudson.
There they received medical aid.
Van Dorn was carried 80 miles on a litter swung between two
mules. He traveled comfortably.
After Lieut. W. B. Hazen and his party had a battle, October,
1859, Judge McCormick. went 80 miles to Fort Clark after surgical
assistance for the wounded. It took three days and nights to get
back with a hack and the surgeon. The scarcity and "the crudity of
surgical instruments is illustrated by the fact, as related by Sowell,
that the surgeon pulled a number of arrowheads out of the men by
using a bullet mold.
W. F. Robinson--son of Dr. W. H. Robinson, surgeon at Fort
Belknapmgives an excellent insight into conditions prevailing on
the frontier in 1864.
* * * "Peever was in the act of mounting. * * * An arrow pierced
the back of his neck and penetrated his throat to the extent that
he could not swallow. When he reached home father was called
in and a brief diagnosis revealed the fact that the arrowhead * * *
when the shaft was withdrawn, had remained partially imbedded
in the neck bone, the rehr or larger end of the missile pressing
against the esophagus.
Father had no forceps with him at the
time. * * * But there was a small forge and a few blacksmith’s
tools on the ranch. An unskilled worker in iron chanced to be
present. Father stood by and showed his smithy how to make a
pair of pincers.
The instrument was rudely fashioned, but it
answered the purpose for which it was intended and the spike was
removed. Later blood poisoning set up and the patient died."

After the Indian raid in Young County, settlers sent a courier
for Dr. Robinson. The messenger arrived late in the evening. The

62

doctor did not go until the following morning.
had been shot in the breast with an arrow.

He found Bragg

"On s~iking the breast bone the shaft had glanced, following
the course of a rib to the back, where the spike was located just
under the skin between the shoulder blades.
Father ordered a
blanket spread out upon the floor and on this he made the old
man lie flat on his face. Making an incision in the flesh he
moved the spike. * * * 1Y£r. Bragg recovered."

At the Fort Davis hospital a stage driver, previously mentioned,
was in pain while having two arrows removed. But no chloroform
was administered, as it was very scarce and the case was not considered serious.
During the attack on Miller and Morrow, their wagon went into
a ditch and one horse was killed. They then cut the traces and
made a run on horseback, escaping into the timber.
’~3oth of us," Miller states, "were terribly nauseated and burning

with fever. We remained hidden until about nine o’clock next
day. * * * Wild with thirst, I tried to reach Brady creek, but grew
so sick I could go no further. * * * Morrow crept back to me with
one of his boots full of water. * * * Next day rescuers got a wagon
and hauled us home. * * * Both recovered after a number of surgical operations. I was compelled to use crutches for two years."
After the Salt Creek fight the wounded white men lay on the
ground all night. One man carried water in the crown of his hat
to the wounded. A colored man volunteered to go ten miles to a
ranch for a wagon and team. The post doctor from Jacksboro met
them, probed their wounds and permitted them to return to their
homes.
When Major George H. Thomas and several of his men were
wounded, Lieut. Lowe attended to the wounded and soon had them
in condition to be moved. Two days later they were met by a
spring wagon and the hospital steward. After another two days
they reached Camp Cooper, where better care was accorded them.
Recovery Attributed to Empty Stomach

In writing of his arrow wounds Major Van Dorn said: "The
doctor says that if nay stomach had been full, instead of being perfectly empty as it was, I would have died. I don’t know how true
this may be, but I am certainly in a fair way to get up now."

Indian Arrow and Lance Wounds

In discussing the important battle with the Indians in Palo Duro
Canyon, September 28, 1874, Captain Carter writes: "One man was
shot through the bowels, but he got well; his recovery, the doctor
said, being due to the fact that he had been without food so long."

THE WATERMELON ISLAND SITE IN
ARKANSAS
BY DR. AND MRS. T. L. HODGES
The Mid-Ouachital region of Arkansas, situated on the edge of
the Ouachita Mountain Range and contiguous to the Coastal Plain,
offered the prehistoric inhabitant many of the lures which draw the
admiring tourist to it today.

The Ouachita River, after its moun-

tain meanderings, is broad, clear and banked by rich alluvial bottoms.

Beyond these rise the picturesque, timbered, rocky hills.

A perfect setting for a relatively permanent Indian inhabitation.
Settled on the fertile banks in communities, he could pursue agriculture to supply vegetable wants, look to the wooded hills for protection and as an infinite storehouse of animal food, clothing, mineral
and timber necessities. An abundance of everything was here, as
wel! as a mild climate and natural beauty.
We thus are not surprised to find numerous Indian sites along
the Ouachita River in Arkansas. Until recently few archaeologists
of national repute ’had focused their attention on this theatre of
prehistoric Indian cultures.

Harrington and Moore recorded the

findings of their work, which represent the best archaeological efforts of their time. Recently Arkansas archaeologists, mostly amateurs, stimulated by out-of-the state trained experts and prodded
into scientific activity by the destruction of irreplaceable data by
flood, plow, and the commercial dealer, finally became aware of
Arkansas’ many valuable evidences of aboriginal cultures. This
state presents many prehistoric horizons especially of the potterymaking Indians.

Least clarified as yet is the Mid-Ouachita com-

plex, which is intricate and indicative of many ages and influences.
As an example of this melting-pot, we chose Watermelon Island of
Hot Spring County, Arkansas, as a site representing many variant
forms of aboriginal cultures.

This eleven hundred acre alluvial bottom-land island is formed
by the Ouachita River on the east, and a bayou on the west. It

Survey, on "Menard Site on the Lower Arkansas River."

lies at the base of a sandstone bluff fronting the Midway Community in Hot Spring County. Its sandy soil is rich in loam but also
mixed with considerable clay, resulting in a hard compactness which
the planters term tight soil. The whole island is subject to at least
six inches of overflow every spring, but soon drains and dries.
Overlooking it from the old Military Road skirting the one hundred
fifty feet high bluff, the island appears as a vast plain merging
into two successive plateaus on which are located Indian mounds.
Indian village sites abound everywhere.
On the island are two mounds. One is on the eastern higher
plateau and near the present river channel; this rises about twenty
feet above the surrounding sand and is oblong in shape. The
second Indian mound is on the west side of the island on a second
terrace from the present boundary-bayou; this is about six feet
high and badly eroded by overflows. It crowns a fertile black
section of land commonly referred to as Dutchman’s Garden because
of an early pioneer’s cultivation of fruits and vegetables on this
portion.~ This elevation, rich in artificats, middens, and burial
plots probably fronted the main Ouachita River channel in prehistoric times, for the river has changed2 beds since 1804 when
Dunbar and Hunter3 traveling upstream recorded the "Isle de
Mellon" as sighted on their right! A slough-bed ten feet below
this plateau is reminiscent of ancient shore-lines. Regardless of the
shift in channel, the island was the home for a long period of a
group of prehistoric agricultural communities of unusual resources.
Salt licks prevailed on the neighboring mainland; mussels and fish
abounded in the river; deposits of finest pottery clay were convenient nearby; upstream, within easy distance were the healing
vaporous waters and also the novaculite quarries of today’s Hot
Springs district.
A surface observation of the island’s middens reveals signs of
a conglomeration of chronological material to which can be added
a weahh of excavated evidence.

pit was carefully excavated to a depth of six feet4 in 1939. The
location was near the base of Dutchman’s Garden mound. Findings
confirmed the belief in Marksvillian occupancy of Watermelon
Island, but no associated burials were found. About forty feet
from this spot there had been found on the surface a hard, miniature jar identified as Yokena Incised of the Marksville complex.
Overflow had exposed it in the midden debris of these early people,
but its unusual hardness and two and a half inch size were fortuitous
factors in its perfect survival. The pot is urn shaped, of buff
grit-tempered paste, very smooth and hard, possessing a squared,
thickened rim below which is a band of Yokena Incised motif of
Ford’s marker-type. This site fronting the Dutchman’s Garden
mound and on the brink of a slough-bed had been badly eroded by
plow and overflow, and the top soil containing aboriginal refuse
washed into the slough.
The intermediate stage of Coles Creek complex is merely suggested by the plain ceramic sherd-types which are easily confused
with the undecorated Marksville potsherds in this state. The c!ose
resemblance renders diagnostic chronology ineffective.
To date
Coles Creek evidences have not been found on the ishmd. However,
the artifacts found indicate two Caddo horizons--the late Caddo
and an earlier, thus far unclassified complex.

be conjectured for the surface is subject to change by overflow
yearly, sometimes losing inches of top-soil and often gaining a
new layer. The top foot of earth is sandy and friable, but changes
to a tightly packed, half-clay consistency at the level of grave
offerings.
Seven ceramic vessels constitute an average votive offering to the
dead. The pottery was commonly grouped in a curve following
the top of the head and arms; at times specimens were atso at the feet
and by the hips. Placement of artifacts and discoloration of graveearth indicated extended burials but in no symmetrical arrangement
with respect to the rising and setting sun. When the pottery was very
numerous it was often stacked. Much of it was broken in the
grave and surfaces were badly leached. The contour of burial
placements outlined by about one hundred and fifty exhumations
followed a diagonal curve across the lesser plateau paralleling the
old slough bed at its base. Within this peripheral curve were scattered groups of burials and large middens of refuse-earth well
filled with mussel shells.
The findings in individual graves were consistently patterned;
a water-bottle, collared jars, several cazuelas, often a seed-jar and
in unusual cases, an effigy vessel. Pipes were rarely found. Shel!
beads and bone implements had decomposed in the soil.

No bundle burials and not a sign of cremation were
Grave-earth is filled with red pigment lumps.
One

burial contained a small bow1 from whose original contents a green

White chalky

pigment, occuring as filler in ceratnie decorations, was absent in

Often caches of pretty water-washed pebbles were
with ceramic offerings.

Thus the variations add interest to the

commoa pattern.

The most common vessel found is the cazuela, more often of
the sand-tempered red Bayware than the shel!-tempered Caddo
brown drab. Rarely the intricate Caddo-type rim motif is whitepaint filled; only one vessel suggests red-paint filler. This bowl
is very comtnor, in the Caddoan Red River complex. On Watermelon Island the howl types run the gamut of sizes and designs

inches across. Even a salt-pan was found which was huge, thick
and flat, but almost crushed. Semi-conical bowls with narrow
brims neatly engraved in curvilinear motif sometimes reinforced
with symmetrical appliqued notches, represent the Natchitoches
interpretation of Caddo design. An interesting specimen is a rollbrimmed globular bowl with body decoration of interlocking bands
of solid confluent curvilinear lines and neck banded in an imitation roulette. Spearing replaces Caddo cross-hatching on a few
specimens. All bowls are highly polished inside and out. The
general design conforms to Caddo origination.
The muhiplicity of water-bottles, so often found in an upright
position with a cazuela, are either plain or engraved.

Never have

we seen them topped by either a pebble or a pottery disk in situ.
The broken-line engraving is the most repeated motif. Engraved
bottles trend to red-paint filling. The original high polish of the
drab brown to black, shell-tempered paste is frequently badly
leached. Necks vary with designs, which are many. Represented
are broad bands of cross-hatching emphasizing ovals, all-over curvilinears, appliqued notched strips, appliqued vertical bands, annular decoration at base of neck, four lobed stars, and others which
are hard to adequately describe. Bases are round and flat. The
all-over engraved bottles fall into the Natchitoches standardization
Glendora bottles of graceful design and well executc,~l combed
geometric motifs are included.
Two unusual forms occur: the
compound and the tripod forms.

One plain compound form has

an eight-holed partitional disk inside the constriction between compartments, similar

to

a modern dripolator!

One

three-legged

(tripod) bottle is enormous. Each rounded leg is two inches in
diameter and the vessel is eleven inches high. It was found associated with typical Caddo grave offerings.

Carinated bases are

not unusual. One neckless water-bottle of Glendora origin has a
capacity of about three gallons. An engraved loop-bottle is another
unique specimen.

However, of greatest surprise and unusual inter-

est, was a cameo bottle of concentric, red painted broad circles on

Collared jars are numerous, of similar silhouette, varying in
size, but the combination of incised motif on collar and body of
urn is seldom alike. On a twelve inch high and eleven inches
broad vessel, the design is the common deeply incised meander
alternating with finger-nail decorated bands. The better specimens
are of reddish paste and are of all-over meander motif. These
are very attractive and heavy. These reddish vessels are not
washed ware. The firing-temperature alone produced the color
of the outside surfaces. An exceptional vessel of this type is a
lavenderish shaded one, which is sooty inside, as if it might have
been used as a flare-torch. The surface is badly leached and the
outside collar and body decoration is brush-marked. The soil
taken from the body of the pot was very slimy; we have not yet
subjected it to chemical assay. In this collared class occur most
of the soot-stained cooking vessels. We like to imagine that the
largest twelve inch high collared jars, which are not carbon-stained,
might have been used for storage purposes. Applique and threenoded decorations sometimes reinforce the meander or concentric
circle motif. Bottoms are always flat.
Effigies are well represented on this island. Human effigy
water-bottles have been found in Caddoan shell-tempered ware.
One is a Glendora bottle, very nicely fashioned of a conventionalized
human-head design. Two turtle effigies represent the hard and
soft-shelled varieties. A bear-effigy bottle commands interest. A
gondola-shaped boat-effigy banded by Caddoan engraving is handsome. Among the effigy-rim decorative class were found likenesses of fish, fox, deer, tortoise, quail, frog, and rattles. Also
in this class are the three sided and four sided boat bowls. Many
Eastern Arkansas animal effigies seem to have been duplicated in
Caddo ware.

The most specialized and unique ceramic type in our locality
should have a scientific name and classification.

On Watermelon

Island, this type of specimen is well represented. This kind of
Mid-Ouachita ceramic art is the seed-jar or seed-urn. Its distribution seems limited to four or five counties centering in Hot Spring
County. To date on Watermelon Island there have been found the
greatest number of these interesting receptacles. A complete census
would require extensive excavations but a surface-sherd survey might
solve the problem of the restricted locale of the seed-jar.

From

personal observation only, the seed jars have been found in the
Ouachita River valley, as far north as Buckville and south in the
vicinity of Ozan.

It is odd that a vessel of such utilitarian design

and artistic balance should have been manufactured in such a
limited area. The criteria of a seed-jar are: (1) the completed,
circular, small orifice measuring from l:t~ inches to 1~ inches
on top of the vessel; (2) the semi-cylindrical, cylindrical, or
spherical body. These pots occur in two types; plain and engraved.
The plain seed-jars are consistently shaped like a beehive, flatbottomed, and the upper portion of the body tapering to an arch
and topped by the typical small opening.

The appellation, neck-

less bottle is a misnomer, air.hough the image is suggested
that term.

by

In the graves, the seed-jars are associated with Cad-

doan pottery and with exhumations usually of two to three feet
depth.

One exceptional cache of four seed-jars was found four

feet below the top-soil.

Plain seed jars are polished, thick walled~ and range in color
from cinnamon to drab black. They have no lugs (perforated earlike handles) except one unusual find. They vary in height from
six to ten inches; in body-diameter the squatty ones average eight
inches, although some tall, slim and very tapering seed-jars are
only four inches across.
The finest examples are the artistically engraved seed-jars, most
of which are round-bottomed and four-lugged. Two of these

We wonder if the so-called plain gourd-effigy wh’[ch is so similar
to the plain seed-jar but which has the orifice slant-wise on top
might not be included in seed-jar types, The most unique engraved
seed-~ar from this island is a pinkish-red flat-bottomed and concave topped and sand-tempered four-lugged container. A most
rare receptacle, an off-shoot of this category, is a reticule-like round
vessel with an inch long orifice near the rim on the engraved face
and two perforations in line on the opposite wall. It resembles
two facing saucers, which are glued together at the rims with openings left. The engraved side is in typical Caddoan combination of
cross-hatching and circular lines. Thongs could have been threaded
through the perforations and the pocket become a convenient dufflebag for the shaman or the chief to hold his precious and mysterious
amulets. The faces of this old receptacle resemble the top and
bottom circular portions of the engraved seed-jar, The object

appears to be a pottery replica of the modern Caddo’s beaded skin
charm bag.6
A rock or a pottery disc carefully fitted over the orifice of a
seed-jar would exclude damage to the contents by rodents or weevils.
Logically, seed must have been stored in covered, dry jars until
needed for planting. These seed-jars certainly are a perfect answer
to that need. However, neither a rock nor a disc cover has ever
been found for the orifice in any exhumation. Seed was precious to
these agricultural Indians. The seed-jars do artistic justice to the
valued contents. Suggested by an authority has been a similarity
of these Mid-Ouachita seed-receptacles to those of Ancient Peru.
We, however, are only describing this interesting Mid-Ouachita
manifestation and hope for a future clarification of its interpretation in the ceramic art of our prehistoric peoples.
Ceramic surface finds include two semi and one completely perforated plain discs; one Caddo loop-ended pipe; two pottery
trowels; rim and animal effigy-heads. Sherds are plentiful.
Some surface finds include many projectiles of all types and
sizes (novaculite is the usual material); double-bitted sandstone
axes; celts of every form; Caddoan perforated breast gorgets (some
notched); boatstones, discoidals, hammer stones, smoothing rocks,
chipping stones; a few stone beads; net-sinkers; charm-stones;
paint-pots. A stone tubular pipe augments the confusion of the
prehistoric picture.
On Watermelon Island the Caddoan complex predominates in
both the ceramic and stone artifacts. The pottery on this island
alone would bear out Swanton’s statement that the Caddoan ceramic
art had no superior short of the Pueblo country. But more significant is the correlative material of continuous occupancy of the
early peoples of the Mid-Ouachita Basin, and the suggestion particularly in the Caddoan period, of peripheral cultural admixtures
of alien influences.. According to Swanton,7 in this region lived
the historical Cahinnio Caddo (region about Hot Springs), the

most remote tribe of the Caddoan Confederacy. The common
Caddo heritage is obvious, but intermingled are evidences of extensive cultural exchange. In the Caddo variants are possible factors
of the horizon of the tentatively called Early Caddo, the predecessor
of the historic Caddo. Watermelon Island has also served to
extend the horizon of the Marksville culture to the north and east,
as Ford had predicted,8 linking the South’s Marksville to the North’s
Hopewellian culture. Watermelon Island, as a typical unit of the
Mid-Ouachita archaeological region has the earmarks of an important link in the ethnological chain of the Arkansas aborigines.

SOME ARCHAEOLOGICAL MATERIAL IN THE
MUSEUM OF THE AGRICULTURAL AND
MECHANICAL COLLEGE OF TEXAS
By CURTIS J. HESSE

In the development of any Museum some unexpected acquisitions
of material occur. The Museum at A. & M. does not have extensive
collections of archaeological material, nor are such collections
planned as part of its future development. Nevertheless, some
such material has been obtained through both gifts and collecting.
The following three items seemed to be worth recording since
they are unusual enough not to be found in ordinary collecting
nor to be seen commonly in the smaller Museums in this area.
1. A cache of unusual lithic artifacts.
The collection of large artifacts described here was obtained
from the discoverer by the late Dr. Mark Francis, a few days
after they had been found. The collection was found in 1931
while Mr. C. W. Manning was breaking some newly cleared land
when his plow struck the cache. The site is on the farm of Mrs.
Emory, situated four miles northeast of Bryan, Brazos County,
Texas. The large artifacts were in a conical pile, and the plow
struck the topmost stones. Mr. Manning stopped at once and
began to gather the implements which he exposed by digging with
his hands; in a foot or so of the loosened soil he collected 13
large artifacts. These were carried home and two given away
before the rest of the collection (eleven pieces) was turned over
to Dr. Francis.
The site of the find is in an area drained by Wickson Creek,
but lies about a quarter of a mile from the creek itself. The field
slopes to the north toward the western branch of the creek, and up
until 1930 the south, or upper end of the field, was covered with a
growth of post oak (Q~ercus stellata). It was a small hill or knoll,
a part of which was cleared for a field. Neither Mr. Manning,
nor those farming the ground at present, have found any other
material in this spot. A half to three-fourths of a mile away in
the Wickson creek bottom are camp sites. It would seem that these

artifacts were buried or cached in this spot and
on a former camping ground.

not

81

abandoned

Often one finds such accumulations in and around springs or
other places where offerings were left by the Indians, but at this
locality there is nothing to indicate that such was the case. The
knoll is topographically a local high, and there are no signs that
a spring ever existed there. Since these were the only artifacts
found, the cache idea seems to be the most sound explanation of
their location; perhaps the owner died or for some other reason
was unable to return for his possessions.
Description o] the Collection:

The eleven artifacts in the collection are made of gray (probably
Edwards) chert. Two of the series are slightly lighter in color
than the rest, suggesting that they probably were made from
weathered fragments. The remaining specimens are dark and
very fresh, with no signs of patination. It seems very unlikely
that these implements were made of materials picked up locally.
Chert pebbles do occur in the gravels on the Brazos River and
throughout the county, but none are large enough for the manufacture of such large implements. This coupled with the freshness
of the chert itself strongly suggests that it was obtained and
probably fashioned at the outcrop of the formation. It is likely
that this location is in Falls County, 75 miles to the north,, where
chert horizons occur in the late Cretaceous.
Group 1
The largest of the implements (see plate A) T. A. M. C. Museum
No. 2507, pl. 12 No. 1, is 288 mm. long and 174 ram. wide. It
averages 35-40 ram. in thickness throughout, except at the trimmed
edgbs, and weighs 2172 grams. Over most of the surface the
shaping was done by the removal of large flakes, some as large as
100 mm. by 90 ram. and was apparently accomplished with few
blows and considerable skill. The edges were then trimmed by
the removal of smaller flakes and finally sharpened by working
the edge. This final shaping seems to preclude the idea that these
were blanks to be broken up and used later in the manufacture of
smaller points. On the back of this blade is an area of wellcemented, weathered, gray sand, much lighter in color than the

main body of the artifact, showing that it was made from a fragment at the surface of a chert mass. In outline this artifact is
very symmetrical and well balanced; it shows no trace of any use
or wear. It is more than twice as heavy as any of the rest of the
specimens.
T. A. M. C. Museum No. 2509, pl. 12 No. 3, is 188 mm. long and
140 ram. wide at its base. It is made of a chert somewhat lighter
in color, but of the same excellent grade. This blade also has
been shaped by removal of a few large flakes and then working of
the edge, although this last has been less carefully done.. It
weighs 896 grams, and it is of a true leaf shape with a wide,
though sharpened, base.
T. A. M. C. Museum No. 2508, pl. 12 No. 4, is made of somewhat impure chert, apparently also from the surface of a chert
mass.

It is 173 ram. long by 128 ram. wide weighing 855 grams,

edge not carefully sharpened.
T. A. M. C. Museum No. 2510, pl. 12 No. 5, is somewhat more
celt-like in shape.

It is 180 ram. long by 110 mm. wide and weighs

only 640 grams.
T. A. M. C. Mu~um No. 2577, pl. 12 No. 2, is sinfilar to the
above in shape but is a thinner blade. It is 220 ram. long and
116 mm. wide, with a somewhat elongate leaf shape.

Group H
This group is also made up of five blades, all of the same
material and workmanship as the above but with a distinctive and
characteristic shape.
T. A. M. C. Museum No. 2512, pl. 12 No. 8, is 195 mm. wide
and weighs 853 grams. It has been sharpened around the entire
edge.
This and the following blades are peculiar in that one
side of the long axis is nearly straight and the other convex. Each
apex is pointed to a degree, but the entire implement is distinctly
one sided.

A careful inspection of the large flakes shows that this

was an intentional shaping which is also borne out by the appearance of the other four artifacts in this group.
T. A. M. C. Museum No. 2515, pl. 12 No. 9, deserves~ special
mention since the back or straight side has not been sharpened, nor
has one of the flat sides been worked at all.

It is made of very

dark chert, almost an agate, and was evidently a thin weathered
flake that was picked up. It is 180 ram. long, 90 ram. wide and
weighs 718 grams.
T. A. M. C. Museum No.’s 2511, pl. 12 No. 7; 2513, pl. 12 No. 6;
and 2514, pl. 12 No. 10 are all similar in shape to 2512 and need
no special comment.
Classi]ication and Use

Large lithic artifacts such as those described above have been
known for many years from the eastern United States. They have
been classified by various authors as of different uses, although
the real purposes of such implements is somewhat doubtful. The
largest artifact of all (2507) would be called an agricultural implement or hoe. These large, fiat blades were hafted or used
in the hands to break small areas of ground such as a corn hill.
Often these blades have a high polish at one end from the abrasion
of the soil.
The next two of Group I, 2509 and 2508, might also be classed as
hoes or possibly, as a cutting tool such as an adze. (See Renaud,
1938, p. 62).* They seem small for use in breaking ground and
yet too large for anything else.
2577 and 2510 must certainly fall into the celt or adze grouping
of Renaud. Their leaf shape and blade-like outline strongly suggests such is the case.
Group II is less easy to identify, they do not fall readily into
any of the better known classes. They resemble, in many ways,
scrapers, yet their size would seem to make them unhandy. No.
2515, with its flat back could readily be used as a chopper (Renaud,
p. 61). The other four, since they are sharpened entirely around

the edge, would not be so easy to use and it seems more likely
that they were scrapers.
None of these artifacts bear the slightest trace of use, which forces
the consideration of still another classification of them. Sometimes large partly roughed-out pieces such as these have been
regarded as blanks, or materials of convenient size for carrying,
to be broken up later and worked into smaller points, scrapers, etc.
This may have been done in areas where good flint or chert was
not available but there seems little reason for it in this part of
Texas~ It is true that no local formations carry suitable stone for
manufacture of flint implements yet pebbles and even cobble
stones of chert are abundant along the streams. Such mate~rials
were used extensively by the Indians as local coIlections prove,
but such large flints as those described above are rare. It seems
very unlikely that these would have been so carefully shaped and
chipped if they were to be broken up at a later time.

An Arrow Point in the Skull oJ Bison bison

Since the North American Indians were notable hunters, and
their cultures rich in weapons of the’ chase, it is strange that we
find so few existing evidences of the power of those weapons. It
would seem that injuries to both animals and man would be commonly found in both burials and in camp sites. Yet such is not
the case; evidences of wounds, either fatal or healed, are so rare
as to excite interest whenever they are found.
The specimen figured and described here was brought to the Museum by Mr. G. C. Everett for the owner, Mr. Sam S. Hanover, Jr.,
of Stephenville, Erath County, Texas. The skull was found about
three years ago, two miles east of De Leon just off highway 67. It
was found by Mr. J. A. Owens who stated that it was exposed in a
field after a heavy rain. It had, according to information furnished,
been buried beneath about three feet of soil. The discoverers
were unable to say whether any of the rest of the skeleton was
there, or if other Indian artifacts were found in the immediate
vicinity.

The skull (T. A. M. C. Museum No. 2880) pl. 13 is that of a
recent bison, probably of a bull.

The maxillaries, nasals, etc.,

are all missing, the basicranium, as is usual, being all that is
preserved. The skull is that of an adult, the sutures are almost
obliterated and all parts preserved are well ossified. The bone
is well preserved but bears no trace of fossilizations nor were the
circumstances of its discovery indicative of any great antiquity.

The arrow point is of gray chert somewhat roughly chipped
and is a stemmed point. It was discharged from the left side of
the animal and from slightly above the position in which the head
was carried. This strongly suggests that the attacker rode a horse,
which would give him approximately this position. The point
pierced the left parietal just behind and slightly below the frontal
expansJ.on of the base of the left horncore. The point is imbedded
firmly in the bone’ for over one half its length, about 18 ram. is
left above the bone surface and approximately 25 nun. is buried
in the cranial roof. The tip of the point did not penetrate the
brain cavity due to the great thickness of the bone at this point.
It could in no sense be regarded as causing a fatal wound. Nevertheless, there are no signs of healing at the edges of the bone,
and it seems probable that the animal was killed within a short
time after this point was driven into the skull. This may have
been the result of another arrow discharged at the same time,
the hunter being unable to remove this point from the skull.
The point itself is somewhat smaller than one would expect to
see used against bison. It is 25 ram. across the base, 16 ram.
across the stem and 6 mm. thick on the exposed part. It is
definitely not on’e of the Iarger, heavy kind so often called hunting points. While the roof of the skull here is over an inch and
a half thick it was not solid bone, l~ut is made up of large air cells
which lighten it considerably. However, living bone is said to be
comparable to green oak or ac_h in strength and resiliency so the
arrow must have been driven with great force from the bow.
Judging from the power of the bows in use by archers today,
the arrow must have been fired at close range from at least a
50 pound bow.
If the surmise that the hunter was on a horse is correct, then
the arrow, must have been discharged sometime after 1520, the

90

date of the reintroduction of horses.

It is also likely that it was

discharged prior to 1850, for by that time the bison had become
very rare in this area, and firearms had largely replaced the bow.
Part HI

An Unusual Collection o] Micralhhs

In the summer of 1939, Mr. J. E. Crabtree brought a collection
of interesting points to the Museum. These had been picked up
during the "dust bowl" days in Dallam, Hartley, and Sherman
Counties in the Texas panhandle. Mr. Crabtree said that the
points were easily found in the "blowouts" which were common
in that area a few years ago, and during the course of his
regular duties as County Agricultural Agent, he had picked up
the entire collection.
The poims were made of a considerable variety of flint and
chert, probably from the pebbles so common in the gravels of the
Ogallala formation widely exposed in that area. They are of a
superior type of workmanship, possibly due to the excellence
of the materials from which they are made, the flaking is fine
and even and the collection contained many beautiful examples
of the small points often found in this region.
With this material, was a series of points so small and delicate
that they were most outstanding (Plate 12, B). In size they
were as small or sraaller than any other points on record. Their
size and perfection was enough to excite curiosity and suspicion,
but a hasty check of their surface markings, etc., failed to disclose
any of the markings usually seen in spurious flint work.
Mr. Crabtree left three of the small points at this museum and
at a later date his entire collection was loaned to us for further
study. At this time Mr. Crabtree informed us that the small
artifacts were made by a boy in Dalhart, Texas.
A careful examination and comparison of these points with
authentic material (see Plate 12, A) from the collection discloses
the following criteria upon which they may be distinguished.
1. Smallness of size.
2. Perfection of shape.
3. Freshness of appearance.

Some Archaeological Material in A. & M. College Museum

91

4. Unusual or nontypical shapes.
5. Metal marks or a few.
6. Suspicious looking fiat surfaces on some.**
Should one or two such points become mixed with the smaller
points from this area they would readily pass for authentic specimens. Unfortunately, such spurious work is not uncommon in
Texas but most of it is so crude that it is readily recognized.
Often points, etc., are made merely as a test of skill by someone, and the result tried out on some local collector. Many
amateur collectors are not difficult to fool, and often buy such
material from the maker. Thus, without intending to do more
than try one’s hand at flint chipping, the picture changes to the
perpetration of a fraud.
True microliths are found within this area, but are not common.
These small points are often called "bird-points" and were possibly
used in blow guns. While the true points might exhibit one or
more of the above six criteria, it is unlikely that they would be
characterized by all.
Spurious work has caused considerable trouble within our state,
and was one of the immediate causes of the passage of legislation
in the spring of 1939 to cover such cases. The act passed by
the 46th Legislature makes it unlawful to reproduce or forge any
archaeological or other object, representing same to be original,
selling, or exchanging the same, etc.
The writer

in no way wishes to discourage those interested
their hand at flint chipping, but the idea of fooling
the collector is one to be discouraged. Still more
of such material as authentic, for only the amateur

A PUI~BLO POT BOUND Nt~AR
PARIS, Tl~XAS
BY GI~oRc~ T. WR~CHT

A few miles south of Paris, Lamar County, Texas, lies Aud’s
Creek. It flows into Sulphur River across interlocking fingers
of gray and black land toward the broader prairies farther south.
Here the buffalo once roamed and our nomadic Indians followed
them. Westward, toward New Mexico, stretch hundreds of miles
of other buffalo range; other wild Indians hunted there. Although
artifacts, inclt~ding potsherds abound in the neighborhood, no
whole specimens of clay pottery had been found nearby until the
spring of 1937.
In that year, a small group of boys, were crossing a field near
Aud’s Creek.. Down the middle of the eroded surface of this field
a rather shallow ditch had washed. In crossing the ditch, one of
the boys noticed a peculiar object in the bottom of it, half buried
in earth, which proved to be an Indian pot. This was secured
by the writer who, at the request of Mr. A. T. Jackson, sent
it to the University of Texas for study and photographing. Since
it was evident that the pot belonged with the western Indians,
pictures of it were sent to Dr. H. P. Mera of the University of
New Mexico by Mr. Jackson, asking for information as to its
origin and a possible explanation of how it happened to be
found in east Texas. Extracts from Dr. Mera’s letters to Mr.
Jackson and myself follow:
June 13, 1939.
The very interesting prints and color sketch of the vessel from
Lamar County arrived yesterday. If this specimen is from the
County named, which I have no reason to doubt, it is a most
surprising occurrence.
One is apt to hesitate in definitely naming a pottery type without
first examining the physical properties, such as paste, slip and
paint but aside from this lack I feel reasonably sure that your
PLATE 14
Nos. 1, 2. are two views of a pueblo pot found near Paris, Texas.

Platte 14

A P~eblo Pot Fou~i Ne~" pa~i~, Tezas

jar is of Zuni manufacture. Its decorative style is representative
of a fashion in use circa the middle of the 19th century.
Your photographs are so clear that the dark granular core in
the light grayish paste seen in a cross.section of the vessel’s
walls appears to be typical.
June 21, 1939.
Thank you very much for permission to keep the prints and
also for copies of the letters from Mr. Wright. The latter appear
to clear up the circumstances surrounding the discovery in a
satisfactory manner.
The vessel’s occurrence so far east may well be accounted for
by trade through several hands. It is unlikely that raiders from
the eastern plains could have reached as far west as Zuni and,
unless it had previously reached the Rio Grande, such an idea
seems untenable.
The period in which the pot was produced was one of considerable unrest in the plains area and hence there would be little
chance of tracing its course. I fear we are going to have to leave
the matter to our individual imaginations.
June 23, 1939.
Many thanks for the offer to send the pot for examination,
but I feel that as there is no hope of identifying the tribe that
had it last, thus perhaps helping to trace a trade route, not
enough would be gained to take the chance of shipping.
There are only two possible sources of origin, the Pueblo of
Zuni or the Pueblo of Acoma, both in the same cultural area.
Although I hesitated to make an exact identification I feel certain
that the former village is where it was made. Either way it
is a very interesting circumstance to find an example of Pueblo
pottery as far from home without having been broken in transit.
(Signed)

H.P. Mera.

While, as stated above, the artifact in question was not found
by the present owner, there is no reason to doubt the story of the

96

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

boy, which was well substantiated. A trip to the site of the find,
personally conducted by the discoverer, showed things "as he
had described them. However, this was over a year after the
find. In the interim, the old field had been made into a pasture
and vegetation covered not only all the fieId but the ditch itself
and hid whatever evidence there might have been that could have
thrown light on the strange occurrence of a Pueblo pot in Caddo
lands. There is no house closer than a half-mile to the spot and
no sign of there ever having been one near,
The, pot measures 51/~ inches high by 51/~ inches at its widest
diameter and is painted white, both inside and out. Four black
bands, ~ inch wide, divide the outer surface into equal segments.
Between these the spaces are taken up by connected stairs which
are alternately red and black. The painted decoration covers the
whole side of the vessel and overflows for 1~ inch into the interior.
See Plate 14 Nos. 1-2.
Apparently, it had been near grass roots and was washed up by
spring rains. It is still in fairly good condition despite the fact
that it must have been carried from its place of origin a thousand
miles away.

Ground Sandstone Balls of Upper Elm Creek Bed Grave~

GROUND SANDSTONE BALLS OF UPPER
ELM CREEK BED GRAVEL
B~ CYRus N. R~Y
At a place in the Henry Sayles Ranch situated on Elm Creek
twenty-five miles southwest of Abilene and at a distance of about
two miles west of Highway No. 158 The Hamlin Sand and Gravel
Company is engaged in removing great quantities of gravel for
commercial purposes from the bed of Elm Creek. At this place
there is considerable water flow under and through the gravel bed.
The gravel mainly consists of broken up cretaceous limestone
pebbles which have washed into the stream from the surrounding
small mountains.
The immediate banks of the creek here are
composed of rather compact sandstone which contains many very
much harder nodules which are of an almost quartzite hardness.
These sandstone beds also extend for some distance up the hillsides,
which erosive forces have worn down and gullied considerably.

The hard nodules of these standstone beds take various peculiar
forms which persons with good imaginations often take to be fossils.
In their natural state many nodules are of oval or almond shapes,
some are shaped roughly like turnips, and carrots and various
Other natural features. Some occur in rounded pairs joined.
Some are quite large and roughly resemble fossil tree trunks.
Many of the nodules while embedded in the matrix have a
rounded outline in one diameter, but most of these are flattened
in the other. The writer does not recall seeing any round bails
embedded in the sandstone matrix, although they may occur.
During the removal and the processing of the gravel from the
stream bed the gravel is taken out from below the water level by
drag-line and then carried in trucks to a screening machine which
sorts it for various sizes.

As the gravel is carried over a conveyor

belt to the moving screens a man is stationed to remove the oversized stones which wilt not pass through the rock crusher.

This

man has seen and removed a great number of quite round and very
hard sandstone bails from the conveyor belt.

During the summer

of 1943 the superintendent of the wozk, Mr. Otto Deats, brought

98

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

three of the bails to me for an opinion as to their origin.

(See

Plate 15).

¯ These balls, vary in size considerably and as I write, there are
nineteen of them spread out before me. The largest is 5½ inches
in diameter. The next largest is 41/~ inches in diameter, one is 4
inches, one is 3 11/16 and one 3 9/16 inches in diameter. Seven
range from 2 13/16 to 2 9/16 inches in diameter. Seven others
range from 2 3/16 to 1 13/16 inches in diameter.
While the bails are more rounded than natural objects usually
are, they are not perfectly so, and the diameters vary more in some
than in others. There are indications in some that their rounded
forms may have been derived from the grinding down of apple
shaped, oval and almond shaped nodules. None of the stones are
polished, but most have a ground down appearance.
Some balls are pitted all over as though they were once subjected to percussion all around in a conscious effort to round their
surfaces down. The balls are of far harder stone than the great bulk
of the gravel in which they lie; which consists mostly of limestone. ’Nearly all of the balls have whiter spots on them which
appear to be marks where something struck them fairly hard
blows.
Occasionally a similar shaped sandstone ball of about baseball
size has been found in surface Indian campsites, but the writer has
not thought this to be of much significance because Indians brought
unusual colored or shaped stones into their camps much as we do
today. The first time the writer’s attention was directed to the
balls was in 1927 when Mr. J. F. Cunningham who owned a ranch
two or three miles west of this site brought one to the writer and

stated that such balls occured in the bed of Elm Creek.

103

The one

he brought in seemed to be of limestone and was of the size and
shape of a croquet ball.

Mr. Dears stated that there probably had

been several hundreds of the balls found in the gravel he had
screened and that most visitors had carried some away.

A tre-

mendous amount of gravel has been screened however, from which
these were picked. In a visit to the portion of river bed graveIs
situated above water level, I was unable to find any of the balls.
In addition to the rounded ground off balls there were many of
both large and small sandstone nodules which had been little if
any affected by the grinding action noted on the round balls. Most
of the ground off balls were of sizes which a man could conveniently throw in a game, or use as war missles. The banks are
high and vertical for a considerable distance above the gravel
beds, and a permanent spring flow and pools of water always
existed there. It might have been possible for expert throwers to
use these balls as missiles to kill game or as war weapons. Above
the creek bed at this place is a high vertical sandstone bank and on
top of the bank is a large flat area which was covered by an old
Indian campsite.
On the opposite side of the valley in the gullies of the high eroded
sandstone slopes of the hills artifacts of the ancient Clear Fork
Culture are found.
A puzzling feature is that there is an occasional quite large stone
which seems to have been subjected to the same type of grinding.
One of the latter which measures roughly 9 by 10 inches in
diameter is also rounded off by some agency and there are three
indentations in it, one round one at the bottom, and two oval ones
opposite each other higher up. Any rough resemblance which it
may have to human features probably is purely fortuitous I believe.
(See Plate 16, Nos. ]. and 3). There are no discernable tool marks on
the openings. It seems that the stone balls have been found in the
stream bed and present valley floor of upper Elm Creek for at
least a distance of five or six miles.
The son of the ranch owner, Mr. C. M. Sayles, stated to the
writer that he had noticed the stone bails in Elm Creek gravel

104

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

during a period of years. He also stated that the same kind of
stone balls had been found in gravel test pits off to the sides of
the valley floor, as well as in the present stream bed where those
described above were found. Mr. Saylcs did not know whether or
not this type of ground ball could be found in the older high
stream terraces. It would be interesting to determine in how old
terraces they may occur.
If the ground down, and in some instances, pecked surfaces, were
formed by stream action, the present current of Elm Creek would
seldom reach a violence sufficient for such water action; ar,d if
natural agencies caused the rounding off, this must have been under
other conditions than exist at present. The abundance Of the bails
and large area covered by their distribution would suggest a natural
causitive agent. On the other hand the same region has been
inhabited into a rather remote period by primitive man.
What caused the action the writer does not know, and local
geologists are of no assistance as they claim no such natural action
exists. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate diseussion of the
probable cause.

Wind Blown Oil Sands

WIND BLOWN OIL SANDS
BY H. H. ADAMS
.The term oil sand originated in Pennsylvania where petroleum
oil was first produced commercially from .wells. The oil was
found in a fine grained brownish sand that resembled brown sugar.
Thus brownish sand became the pattern that was used as oil sand
for many years, and is still looked upon by the old school of operators as the true oil sand. Oil sand was considered the source of oil
as well as the reservoir for it. This theory has long since been
dropped and it is known now that oil is produced from shales, or
any carbonaceous material that is broken down by heat and pressure.
Oil was found in shales in Colorado, in and around the town
of Florence. One well in this pool produced over a million dollars
worth of oil. This was the first oil to be produced commercially
from shales.
The states of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio and many other places have produced oil from limestone.
In Montague County, Texas, and in South Central Texas oil is
produced from a metamorphic formation known as serpentine and
volcanic ash.
Oil is also found at the southern end of the Green Horn Mountains in Colorado in an igneous dyke that cuts through the Pierre
shale which is a very carbonaceous formation. Oil is not produced
commercially from this dyke but the oil is of high grade and is free.
Oil may be found anywhere.

This theory has the support of most geologists.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss wind blown oil sands,

106

and the above paragraphs are written as a background for the
reader unfamiliar with petroleum geology.
In West Texas, New Mexico and Oklaho~na there is a geological
formation known as the White Horse Sandstone.

This is a series of

sands, redbeds, anhydrites and other salts of the evaporite type.
This formation is a part of the Guadalupe group of Permian
age. This entire series was deposited under desert condiLions, that
is, the sea in which these formations were laid down was surrounded by very dry barren country.
Just before the deposition of the White Horse series in Central
West Texas, the area known as the West Texas Central basin
opened out to the southwest into the ocean. This is established
by the fact that marine life existed there as shown by the fossils.
Then at the beginning of the White Horse period a barrier reef of
some kind cut this area off from the ocean and formed a great
landlocked sea. Evaporation was rapid and beds of the evaporate
type were deposited, except that a great amount of sand was also
deposited. This sand came from some source either from the
southwest or the north, according to the opinion of many geologists.
The land surrounding this great inland sea was low, and the water
that came from the surrounding areas and evaporated undoubtedly
carried in a great amount of this sand. There is also another
theory and that is that this sand was blown into the area from the
surrounding hills. The formations in the-Marathon area are of
a type that would furnish this kind of sand. The important fact
about this sand is that it was subjected to wind erosion.
In the Libyan desert and in many other parts of Africa and
western Asia sands are carried for as much as one hundred and
fifty miles as sand dunes. The grains of these sands, particularly in
the Libyan desert are rounded and polished. These sands come from
a plateau in which much of the material is limestone and shale,
but the sand dunes in their present condition carry no limestone
or shale. This material has been completely ground into dust and
blown away. Possibly the grinding of this material assisted in the
polishing of the sand grains. The wind in its act of transportation
and erosion, has graded or assorted the sand with relation to size.
These sands in the Libyan desert have never been subjected to water

Wind Blown Oil Sands

107

erosion, and they are all equally well polished. Many of the sand
grains are perfectly spherical and vary from very fine small grains
to as large as three or four millimeters in diameter.
In examining the cuttings from wells in the West Texas basin,
it is observed that there are two kinds of sand grains; one highly
polished and the other frosted.
A study of these sands reveals the fact that the larger grains are
frosted, and the smaller ones are highly polished. Another observation is that the fine or smaller grains of sand are on top of the
sand strata, and the larger in the bottom. It appears that at the
end of the White Horse period an invasion or encroachment of
water reworked the sands that had been brought in and polished
them as found in the Libyan desert today, and they were left in the
position we find them now.
The interesting thing is that the small grains are polished and
the large ones are frosted. It is a fact that sand grains less
than one-tenth of one millimeter in diameter take on by surface
tension a film of water that protects them against attrition or
wearing. If there is any movement whatsoever in the water, these
smaller grains of sand are held in suspension. While the sand
grains larger than one-tenth of one millimeter in diameter have no
water film to protect them and carry them, thus they hit each other
in any movement that might occur, and by attrition become frosted.
In the Somo field in Crockett County both oil and gas are found
in the White Horse sandstone, the sand described above. This
sand is undoubtedly not the source of the oil, but by migration or
contact with shale bodies in the same section derives its supply.

A brief

area was made

during spare time with special emphasis upon the high stream
terraces along Terlingua Creek and the Rio Grande.
Geological and Climatic Background

The district explored lies deep within the big bend of the Rio
Grande and is adjacent to the newly created Big Bend National
Park. The rainfall is scant: the soil thin and stony with ocotillo,
creosote bush, lechuguilla, sotol, cacti, and other harsh semi-desert
flora dominating the mesas and valleys. Evergreen forests of pine,
spruce, fir, and cedar are found high up in the Chisos Mountains.
Both Upper and Lower Cretaceous formations are exposed as well as
a large number of different types of igneous rocks, trachyte, andesite
basalts, etc. The country rock is in many places displaced, distorted
and covered by great faults, intruding sills, dykes, lava flows, etc.
Despite the present dry climate and geologic background, the evidence shows that primitive man apparently liked the region and
occupied it for a long period of time.
Rio Grande and TerIingua Creek Gravels

Old stream terraces on the Rio Grande near the Mexican town
of Lajitas and lower down the river from the St. Helena Canyon
outlet to the village of Castolon, were studied in so~ne detail. Terlingua Creek which drains into the Rio Grande, was examined.
Mesa-like gravel capped hills are especially well developed near the
crossing of the Study Butte road. No Indian middens were discovered but the chipper’s debris in some workshops might be fairly
recent. Thick, crude axes, scrapers, blades, and gravers were noted
in some abundance in various places along the terrace summits
and .slopes. The interesting thing about many of these stone tools
was that they were well patinated and resembled artifacts from the
Brazos, the Trinity, Red River and other river drainage areas in

Texas. The stone materials utilized ~nclude chert, quartzite, agate,
jasper, silicified wood, etc. Probably all of these various toolmaker’s materials were collected by the Indians in the nearby
gravel deposits. Chert nodules occur in the Devils River limestone, the massive escarpment forming the rock along Long Draw,
St. Helena Canyon, etc. Semi-translucent logs of chalcedony and
jasper in contact with Cretaceous dinosaur remains are found weathering from the Aguji formations along Terlingua Creek. These
beautiful stones were much utilized by the Indians. Colorful agates,
moss, banded and other types used by the Indians were observed
weathering from amygdaloidal boulders along washes on the flanks
of the Chisos Mountains.

SHOULD WAR STOP CULTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH
In times of public clamor, such as war entails, there is always a
thoughtless minority who seek to stop all cultural and scientific
research not directly connected with war making. Perhaps they
inherently dislike culture and ignorantly fear scientific research at
all times, and war gives them an excuse to vent their dislikes in
moves of suppression.
Such persons, if they should give thought to the matter would
know that even during war all the people cannot make war directly,
and that the majority have to carry on their usual civilian activities to enable them to pay the heavy income taxes and to buy the
bonds necessary to pay f6r the munitions and support the operations
of war.
When you have once destroyed a people’s culture and its science
you have little left on which to rebuild a nation, and the notion that
when institutions are allowed to decay it is easy to rebuild them,
after some emergency has passed, is erroneous.
Into most flourishing scientific and cultural institutions some one
has put a vast amount of labor, thought and care to bring them to
their present productive phase. Someone has nursed them like
a little child through their formative years until now when they
seem to run without much effort, the painful toils of their founders
are forgotten.

the finder’s uncle, Mr. J. C. Putnam, brought the bones to the writer
in Abilene.
The location of the site is sixty miles northeast of Abilene and
near where the writer found two peculiar skeletons buried about
6½ feet deep in 19291 and another skeleton buried below nine feet
deep, which was also excavated with Mr. J. C. Putnam’s assistance
irr 19392.
The 1943 discovery is the deepest buried human remains thus far
found in the Abilene region of Texas,3 although much deeper buried
camp debris deposits have been found in the same region.4
The site was visited with Mr. H. H. Adams, a local geologist,
on June 27, 1943, and the remainder of the skeleton was removed
with the assistance of the boy finder’s father, James P. Putnam,
and his uncle, J. C. Putnam, and H. H. Adams. The skeleton had
been buried in flexed position lying on the left side.
There were no artifacts, shells, or stones with the burial; but the
bones were surrounded by considerable amounts of ashes and charcoal.

The bones and skull resembled some of the long headed types
previously found by the writer in the Abilene region.
Several anthropologists were notified of the find and invited to
see.the site before more high water could cave the bank off again.
The skull had originally been exposed by a bank cave-off due to
a high rise of the Brazos River. Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., of
The Smithsonian Institution came on July 7th and remained fo’r
five days studying the site and a number of other deeply buried
stream bank sites on three different water courts of the Abilene
region.

The skeleton was sent to Dr. Roberts so that it could be examined
by physical anthropologists working with The Smithsonian Institution. When the bones have been carefully studied a complete report
will be issued on the findings.
The burial evidently had originally not been made very deep but
since the body was buried the whole valley floor has filled to a
depth of twenty-one feet.

The river bank silt was banded horizort-

tally and unbroken from a short distance above the bones up
twenty-one feet to the present soil surface. Eight feet below the
burial is a band of ashes and charcoal which is only three feet
above the ordinary water level.
The total height of the nearly vertical river bank at the burial
locality above low water level is thirty-two feet.

A DEEP BURIAL ON THE CLEAR FORK
OF THE BRAZOS RIVER
By FRXNr: H. H.

ROBERTS, JR.

Discovery of the deepest buried human remains thus far found in
the region of Abilene, Texas, was reported to the Smithsonian Institution on July 1, 1943, by Dr. Cyrus N. Ray.

The information con-

tained in Dr. Ray’s telegram indicated that an investigation of the
occurrence was warranted and arrangements were made for the
writer to go to Abilene. Arriving on July 7, he spent the following
five days studying the place where the bones were uncovered, visiting other deeply buried sites exposed in the banks of streams, and
examining the numerous artifacts and skeletal material collected
from them. The nature of these sites and the character of the implements and associated objects which they yield are well known
through the writings of Dr. Ray and because they bespeak a certain
antiquity are important in the study of the early occupation of North
America. Coming as it did from one of the older levels, the present
skeleton gave promise of throwing additional light on the physical
type of the people inhabiting the area at that time.
During the latter part of June, 1943, high water in the Clear
Fork of the Brazos River did considerable damage to its banks,
especially those along that portion of the stream traversing the
Putnam Ranch some 60 miles northeast of Abilene. After the water
had subsided to about its normal level three boys, James Putnam,
Jack Tucker, and’ Don Tucker, were swimming in a pool at the base
of the east bank some distance below the ranch buildings. In the
almost vertical wall several feet above their heads, where a large
block of earth had fallen away, they noticed what appeared to be a
cavity lined with something that extended slightly beyond its edges.
By cutting places, in the hard clay for their feet they were able to
climb to the hole and discovered that the projecting material was,
bone. Using a pocket knife, James Putnam and one of the other boys
dug around the bones and saw that they had part of a human skull.
Carrying the pieces home James turned them over to his uncle, J. C.
Putnam. This was on June 24. Two days later Mr. Putnam took
the pieces of skull to Dr. Ray and the following day, June 27, the

10

Texas Archeological avd Paleontological Society

Doctor and Mr. H. H. Adams, a geologist living in Abilene, went
to the Putnam Ranch.

After photographing the skull mold, which was still intact, Dr. Ray
and Mr. Adams assisted by J. C. and James Putnam, with young
James and several other boys as an audience, proceeded to remove
the skeleton, which extended back into the bank. They were afraid
to leave the remains in place until others could be called to see
them as the caving condition of the bank and the possibility of a new
rise in the stream made their situation precarious. It was found
that the body had been buried in a tightly flexed position, lying on
the left side with the head toward the south,l, 2 Most of the hand
bones were missing. In the Abilene region flexed burials generally
had the hands placed at the head on each side of the facez and in
the present case they probably were carried away with portions of
the skull when the section of the bank fell off and into the water.
All of the long bones, scapulae, innominates, vertebrae, and most
of the ribs were present and in fairly good condition. Some of the
bones were damaged in the process of remo~(al, yet are suitable for
study purposes.
The pit in which the body was placed had been filled with earth
containing an admixture of ashes and charcoal, evidently dirt scooped
up from around the hearth of the camp occupied by the deceased and
his companions. Just why such material was used instead of that
dug from the pit is not known, of course, but many of the so-called
primitive peoples often followed such a practice and it is possible
that it may have had something to do with beliefs pertaining to the
spirit’s needs in the world beyond, perhaps it was in a sense a connecting link between the here and the hereafter. There were no
stones or shells in the grave and apparently no artifacts. While

cleaning the bones and bone fragments in the laborato~’y, however,
the tip end from a chipped instrument was discovered. It was so
thoroughly caked with clay that it appeared to be a small piece of
bone and no doubt was mistaken for such in the field. Because of
its fragmentary condition this bit of worked stone probably was not
a mortuary offering, as a matter of fact none of the deep burials
in the region have had artifacts with them and this has complicated the problem of determining the cultural affinities of the
remains. The type and possible significance of the present specimen
will be considered more fully in a subsequent paragraph.
In the interval between the removal of the bones and the writer’s
first visit to the site, in company with Dr. Ray, Mr. Adams and Dr.
R. H. Tull of Abilene, there had been no new flood in the stream
nor additional caving of the bank. Hence it was possible to judge.
satisfactorily conditions existing at the time the disinterment took
place. There is no doubt that the skeleton came from that location
because a few fragments of bone found in the loose earth that
had been dumped on the talus below, there were some metatarsals still in situ at the back of the pit, and the lower half of a fibula
that fit a piece previously obtained was embedded in the bottom of
the grave. The fill in the pit had not been completely worked out
and in the back portion it was quite evident that an undisturbed
series of strata, layers that were clearly in evidence for a considerable
distance up and down the stream, had risen above it to the top of the
bank and present surface. This demonstrated that the burial was
not a relatively recent penetration and that there had been a long
period of alluviation in the valley, prior to the present channel-cutting era, after the body had been placed there.

A portion of the southern and western periphery had been broken
out by the caving of the bank during the high water and the digging
when the bones were removed, but it was possible to follow and
uncover the remaining sides of the grave to determine its approximate
size and shape. The pit had been roughly oval in contour with diameters of about 2 and 3 feet. It was rather shallow, the measurements naturally being taken from the top of the stratum that was the
surface of the ground when the grave was dug. The uneven bottom
sloped upward from a depth of 15 inches at the north end to’ 1 foot
at the point where it was broken away at the south. The depth at
the south end, however, probably was even less, as Dr. Ray observed

14

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

that the head had lain somewhat lfigher than the body.z No stones
were used either as a lining for the grave or to cover the remains.
In this respect the interment differed from others previously noted
in the area as they had, at least, a few stones over the bones.3, 4 In
this connection it might be mentioned that there appears to be a
definite progression in grave types in this district. The oldest, as
exemplified by the present example, was a simple pit. This was
followed by a pit with stones over the top of the fill and it, in turn,
by one lined with stones and covered with similar material, a slab
cist form of grave. The order is indicated by the depths at which
they occur and the nature of the strata in which they were dug. That
they were not the product of different peoples is shown by the fact
that the skeletal remains suggest a single group. The different
styles of burial probably represent development over a long period,
one in which other cultural elements probably passed through comparable changes.
The grave was 11 feet above the normal low water level, and 21
feet below the present valley floor. The vertical wall rising directly
above it measured 10 feet 8 1-2 inches. Recent erosion and gullying
had carried away the additional 10 feet 3 1-2 inches, leaving a sharp
upward slope to the valley floor proper, but a few feet upstream
there was a vertical bank from the latter to the water and it was
obvious that all of the strata it contained originally had extended
across the area directly above the pit. The deepest burial found
prior to this was one lying 9 feet 2 1-2 inches below the surface.4
tt was on the Matthews Ranch several miles upstream from that on
the Putnam property.
The profile of the deposits exposed by the present stream showed
clearly that the interment was made on the south bank of an old

stream, Plate 5, Number 1, one that had flowed at approximately
right angles to the existing water course and that had been largely
silted up prior to the burial, although a shallow channel 20 to 25
feet north of the grave probably contained water at the time when
the pit was dug. Streaks of sand and gravel in its bottom indicated
a flowing stream and the over-lying stratum of silt extending across
and beyond the top of the grave suggested that it had not been deposited until some time subsequent to the digging of the pit and the
stoppage of wafer in the stream bed. The group of which the de" ceased was a member probably was camping a!ong the old stream
when misfortune overtook that particular individual.
The earth in which the grave was dug, as well as the strata above,
appears to belong to a series of silts designated Elm Creek in one
study5 and called Nugent by Dr. Ray. These silts underlie the
valley floors of the Clear Fork and some of its larger tributaries,
possibly also portions of the main Brazos Valley.

For the most

part they are thick and horizontally bedded and consist o~ almost
uniformly-textured clayey silts and sandy silts. There are few large
gravel lenses. Humus-stained zones, from a few inches to a foot or
two in thickness, usually mark the tops of the silt layers but they are
not true soils and are cracked in such a fashion as to suggest that
they developed under alternating moist and dry conditions. In general they indicate deposition by slack-water sheet floods spreading
over the broad valley floors when conditions were more humid than
the present. A climate suitable to such phenomena probably has not
prevailed in the region since the closing days of the Late Glacial,
the Wisconsin substage, or the pluvial period which in m~re southerly
precincts corresponds to it. For this reason the silts have been
judged to be late Pleistocene in age.5 Yet it is possible, as some
authorities maintain, that the humid period in this area did not
parallel the ice stage farther north but lagged somewhat and the
deposits attributed to it actually had their beginnings in the Early
Recent rather than in the terminal Pleistocene. At all events the
fact ~hat the burial was in the lower part of the silts places it fairly
early in the period of their formation.

It was hoped that there might be some additional evidence, beyond that of the stratum in which it was buried, to indicate the possible age and cultural affinities of the skeleton. Careful inspection
of the banks for some distance up and down stream, at all levels

18

Texas Archeologica~ and Paleontological Society

from the water line to the valley floor, failed to produce either artifacts or animal bones that might have a bearing on the problem.
Elsewhere in the Abilene area implements of the Clear Fork Culture
Complex, some examples of the Durst-Abilene type artifacts, and
sporadic Folsom and Yuma points have been found in the lower
Elm Creek silts~ and the presence of a burial here indicated that it
should be a good location for man-made objects as well. None was
forthcoming, however. In the study of the banks several interesting
manifestations were observed, but they offered n5 help in correlating the human remains with known cultural materials. Eight feet
beneath the burial was a thick layer of ashes, with some admixture
of charc~oal, that extended a considerable distance down stream.
There was nothing to indicate whether it was the result of human
or natural agencies, although its dimensions suggest thd latter.
About a half mile farther down stream were some evidences of
human occupation in the remains of hearths occurring at two different levels. The upper one was 14 feet 10 inches below the present
surface, while the lower was at a depth of 27 feet 4 inches, Plate 5,
Number 2. Along the top of the stratum that had been the surface
when the upper hearth was in use were numerous fragments from
cut and split animal bones. A number showed the effects of fire.
None of the pieces was complete enough or from the proper bone
to determine the exact species of the animal, but most of the fragments can be identified as coming from deer and bison.
The lower heart.h had been entirely exposed by the washing away
of the bank. Many of the rocks were still in situ, however, and
there is no doubt that they at one time formed a fire place on a
definite surface of occupatiori. Neither of these levels yielded any
artifacts and it was not possible to’ determine their cultural horizon.

The lower hearth obviously antedated the period of the burial and
the upper one was considerably later. There did not appear to be
any habitation level at this location corresponding to that where the
burial occurred, although there was a dark-stained zone marking an
old surface and top of one of the silt layers that did correlate with it.
Neither were there traces of the old stream bed along which the
burial was made.
The only possible clue to the cultural horizon of the skeleton is
the small piece of worked stone found with the bone fragments in
the laboratory and it is far from being good, clearcut evidence~
As a matter of fact it is quite disappointing. In the first place
there is definite question as to its actual provenience. Whether it
was in the grave in direct association with the bones, was merely
a fortuitous inclusion in the earth used in the fill, came from the old
surface above the pit, or was dislodged from one of the superimposed
layers is not known. The lack of such material in any of the levels
in the area adjacent to the grave would seem to discount the latter
contingency but offers no suggestions on the other alternatives. If
it had been in direct association with the bones there is the intriguing possibility that it might be the tip end from the projectile
point that killed the individual, while if it simply was in the fill it
would only indicate a broken and discarded implement that happened to be there.
The type of the object itself is about as unsatisfactory from the
standpoint of significance as the conditions under which it was
found. It was made from gray chert and while it has no patina,
the color has bleached considerably as the result of age. Although
relatively fine, when compared with specimens from the older cultures in the area, the flaking appears to have been done by percussion rather than by pressure. A few of the facets left by the
removal of the flakes extend obliquely downward and entirely acros~
the face of the blade, suggesting the technique used in the manufacture of the finer types of Yuma points, but most of them expand
either vertically to about the longitudinal midsection or slant some~
what toward the tip. At first glance it was thought that the pieces
might be from one of the smaller, finer Yuma types but further
examination showed ~,his not to be the case. The edges are bevelled
to the left. This feature is not so apparent when the blade is viewed
full face as it is in cross section, Plate 1, Number 3, section, when

22

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

it is quite evident. The bevelling is fairly narrow with a sharp
slope to the edge. This, together with the slender character of the
point, suggests that it probably is the tip from an awl or drill rather
than from a projectile. The left-handed bevelling indicates that it
was an implement to be used with a clockwise direction in drilling:
If it is part of a drill the postulation that it was a piece of the
weapon employed against the individual buried there would, of
course, be negated. Bevelled projectile points at an early period
are not unknown in the area. As a rule, however, they are heavier
and thicker in form and the bevelling is on the right side of the blade
instead of the left.6 It could be part of one of the’slender, smaller
projectile points from one of the relatively late cultures, yet its
apparent inclusion in the Elm Creek Silts would argue against that
possibility. The whole matter could be dismissed, of course, with
the conclusion that it merely was a late penetration into an old
horizon. Under the circumstances this does not seem to be warranted, hence it is more likely that the present specimen should 5e
regarded as a portion of a drill.
Because drills are rather ubiquitous in their cultural and chronological occurrence and are so basic in their general features that
there is little to differentiate them or to indicate what horizon they
may represent, such an identification adds to the difficulty. Implements of the Clear Fork Culture are found consistently in the Elm
Creek Silts and for that reason it might be concluded that the fragment belonged in that category were it not for the fact that drills or
awls of stone are quite rare in that complex.7 However, it may well
be that it is an example from one of the stages of that culture and the
burial was that of one of the men who made Clear Fork implements.
The artifact measures 23.8 ram. (15-16 of an inch) in length, is 8.7
ram. (11-32 of an inch) in width at the broken end, and is 2 ram.
(5-64 of an inch) thick.
Several features about the skeleton impressed Dr. Ray and the
writer as being indicative of a somewhat primitive form of recent
man. This was especially true in the case of the very heavy brow

bank burial after they were removed, and the long bones mended

ridge, the thickness of the frontal bone, the apparently sharply receding forehead, the lower border of the nasal aperture, and the
conformation of the long bones.

In the latter a certain bowing of

the femora and the manner in which they and the tibiae articulated
suggested the possibility of at least a slight bent-knee gait.

It als6

appeared that the articulation at the elbow was somewhat peculiar
and that it might have produced an outward turning of the lower
arms. Not being sufficiently familiar with these conditions to pass
on them properly, however, conclusions were held in abeyance
awaiting expert opinion. After the writer’s return to Washington
the bones were shipped to him by Dr. Ray and arrangements were
made to have them studied by physical anthropologists versed in
the characteristics of the American Indians. They were first sent
to Dr. Harry L. Shapiro, Chairman of the Department of Anthropology, the American Museum of Natural History, New York, with
mention of the features, listed above, that appeared to be significant.
Upon the completion of his study Dr. Shapir~ sent the writer the
following memorandum:
"It is unfortunate that the Clear Fork skeleton is so fragmentary,
particularly in its cranial parts which, of course, are the most critical.
I have examined the bones and the fragments that survive and I confess that I do not find anything of exceptional interest. The long
bones are moderately robust and suggest a tallish individual. The
tibiae have a marked degree of platycnemia and the femora of
platymeria. Both of these characteristics are common enough in
modern types of man although apparently more frequent in earlier
"phases of recent man. The femora are not especially bowed and
I discover no evidence (unless platycnemia and platymeria be so
taken) for a bent knee gait. The elbow joint seems equally unexceptional.
"What remains of the vault of the skull is too scrappy to provide
solid basis for judgment, but the frontal does have an exceptionally
ht~avy brow ridge and an apparently sharply receding forehead.
This suggests a primitive form of recent man. The lower border of
the nasal aperture also is on the primitive side. The jaw is fairly
broad with everted gonial angles and gives an impression of strength
and ruggedness. From these characteristics it seems fair to say that
while the skull might be approximated by occasional recent Indians,

26

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

it does agree more frequently with the more primitive forms of
neoanthropic man found in America.
"The mending of the broken and fragmentary portions represents
a considerable job and it is hardly justifiable for a great many
of the bones. But if it is possible to leave the skeleton with me for
a while, I ~ould be interested in doing some reconstruction and
measurement. Even if a more detailed study should also fail to
uncover anything unusual, it might still be worth "recording the
characteristics of a find presumably of some antiquity."
The skeleton was left with Dr. Shapiro for several months but,
becau~ of the pressure of work involved in the installation of a
new exhibit hall at the American Museum together with other official duties, he was unable to’ give further attention to it. After
it had been returned to the writer it was taken to Dr. T. D. Stewart,
Curator of the Division of Physical Anthropology, U. S. National
Museum, who spent considerable time in an effort to reconstruct
the skull and in repairing some of the other bones. The results of
Dr. Stewart’s studies are incorporated in the report which appears
elsewhere in this number of the Bulletin.
It is interesting to note in passing that both he and Dr. Shapiro
agree that the skeleton could be that of an early Indian.

Hence

there would be nothing anachronistic in its being found in deposits
that are late Pleistocene or Early Recent in age.
In discussing
other and si~nilar remains found by Dr. Ray a number of years ago
Dr. E. A. Hooton of the Department of Anthropology at Harvard
University reached a similar conclusion. He expres~d the opinion
that the crania from the deep burials in the Abilene region exemplified a very primitive type of American Indian and probably repre.

sented one of the earlier strata of the American population.

He also

pointed out that while they were a neoanthropic or morphologically
modern type it was not impossible for them to date back ta the end
of the Pleistocene becau~ physically modern types of men were in
existence in the Old World before the end of the Glacial Period.8
Since, as is generalIy believed, the New World was populatel by
migrations from northeastern Asia, conditions in the Old World have
a direct bearing on the problem and it is significant to know that
modern types of man had a respectable antiquity in that region.
All three authorities, Shapiro, Stewart, and Hooton, agree that
the geologic age of such skeletal remains must be determined by
that of the stratum in which they are found, rather than by their
morphological features, although the determination is more convincing when some of the latter tend to the primitive side.

Asso-

ciated archeological and paleontological objects, of course, are a
help in fixing an approximate or relative date but like morphological
features they too may not be conclusive.

In the present instance

there was no paleontQlogical evidence and, as already noted, the
single archeological specimen is of little assistance.

Because of this

the most that can be said is that the deeply buried skeleton is of a
type that could be early, that it was hurled in silts that seem to be
late Pleistocene or Early Recent geologically, i. e. 10,000 to 15,000
years ago, and that the individual may have been one of those who
made implements of the Clear Fork Culture Type.

Report on J. C. Putnam Skeleton From Texas

REPORT ON J. C. PUTNAM SKELETON
FROM TEXAS
BY T. D. STEWART
This skeleton was found upon receipt to consist of an incomplete
skull, all of the long bones more or less complete, such bones as
the innominates, scapulae and vertebrae in fragments, and many of
the smaller bones in good condition.

Some repairs had already

been made and all the parts had been treated with a hardening solution.

The bones are dark brown in color, but become a light brown

when brushed with acetone.

The weight of the individual bones is

about average, thus suggesting freedom from mineralization.
characters clearly indicate a male.

Sex

Age changes, especially in the

pubic symphysis, are comparable with an age of about 40 years.
Since the skull is most useful in establishing relationships, an
effort was made to reassemble the parts.

This necessitated cer-

tain assumptions, chiefly because all connection between the upper alveolus and the base of the skull proper, except through
the mandible, had been lost.

These assumptions include the length

of the nose (53 ram.) and face (76 ram.) and the distance between
the alveolar point and basion (102 ram). The figures used for this
purpose approximate the averages for male Texas crania given by
Hrdlicka.~ The two views shown in figure 1 indicate the reasonablehess of the reconstruction arrived at in this manner.
The reconstructed skull was next oriented in the Frankfort position on the Schwartz stereograph and a drawing made of the norma
verticalis (fig. 2). Assuming this skull to have been symmetrical,
the missing left side was restored in the drawing by mirroring the
right side. This procedure was aided by the fact that three landmarks in the median plane are preserved; namely, nasion, bregma,
and basion. The missing occiput was next drawn in freehand to
represent extreme but reasonable dolichocrany. According to this
reconstructed norma verticalis, the maximum length did not likely
exceed 185 mm and the maximum breadth 135 ram. The cranial

32

Texas Archeological and Paleontological SocieSy

index thus would be about 73, with the error being probably on
the side of dolichocrany.
The following measurements obtained on this skull are regarded
as accurate:
Basion-bregma height ........................................ 142 mm
Biporionic vertical height ................................ 118 mm
Basion-nasion

.................................................... 102 mm

Diameter frontal minimum .............................. 97 mm
Nasal width ........................................................ 27 mm
Bigonial diameter .............................................. 1.13 mm
The only significant index derived from these measurements is the
Mean Height Index.

This is figured on the basis of the reconstruc-

tion to be 88.8, which indicates a relatively high head.

It should be mentioned that the teeth of this skull are extremely
worn, so that there was some difficulty in securing a good articulation between the jaws.

Presumably the lateral incisors are the

missing ones. There is also a small ear exostosis in the one auditory
meatus present.
Unfortunately, the skulls collected earlier by Dr. Cyrus N. Ray
in this same r~gion and deposited in the National Museum (Hrdlicka,
1938) are not at present available for visual comparison. Because
of the earlier danger of air raids, these valuable specimens were
evacuated from Washington and have not yet been hrought back.

38

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

observations2 that other tibia from this region are almost invariably
quadrilateral in cross ~ction at the middle, it is of interest to point
out that the pre~nt specimens likewise show this feature (Plate 8).
Hrdlicka had made an extensive study of this subject and there is
every reason to believe that he was correct in pointing out the unusual frequency of quadrilateral tibia in the skeletons from this
region. He explained this finding on the basis of a peculiar function
and fell back upon the Lamarckian viewpoint that the results of this
function had become hereditary. Any such explanation must be
regarded as speculative at the present time. It seems more important
to note that Hrdlicka’s unpublished data show the quadrilateral
l.ibia to be the most common type among all American Indians.
It would appear from these observations that the J. C. Putnam
skeleton presents no unusual features setting it apart from other
remains of known American Indians from this region. Being relatively long-headed and high-headed, the skull could have belonged,
so far as our present knowledge goes, to an early type of Indian.
However, it is impossible to establish the antiquity of this individual
on the basis of the bones alone.

SOMI3 SUGG17.STIONS ON ARCHAEOLOGICAL
TERMS
BY ALEX D. KRIEGER

A number of terms in common use by professional and private
archaeologists alike are very inaccurate, and in some cases positively
misleading. These terms are quite widely employed without, apparently, much concern for their implied meaning. Their origins are
for the most part obscure, but probably for reasons of convenience,
or for want of better terms, they became perpetuated until they were
used habitually even by those who realized their inaccuracy. It is
the purpose of this paper to review some of the more serious abuses,
and to attempt to clarify their use and meaning.
In Texas it is particularly urgent that archaeologists make a real
effort to adopt accurate terminology for certain kinds of sites and
classes of artifacts. This is because the interpretation of Texas archaeology involves several of the major culture areas of the continent; its connections lie with Southwestern, Southeastern, and Plains
cultures, and with the eastern parts of Mexico and Middle America.
Texas has long been a center of interest to those concerned with
possible connections between Middle American civilizations and
some of those of the eastern United States. Thus the following
suggestions emphasize those terms which have more than local significance.
"Mound.~’"
"Mound" is a name applied to virtually every kind of accumulati~;n above ground level, whether it be a few inches or several feet
high. In the aforementioned problem of possible relatious between
Middle America and some cultures of the eastern states, the prevalent loose usage of the terxn "mound" has some rather dangerous
implications.
First of all, a distinction must be made between intentionally- built
structures and so-called "mounds" which are purely incidental heaps
resuhing from extended occupation on the same spot. Obviously,
if the hundreds of sites called "mounds" in various parts of Texas
were actually the result of a definite practice of building eminences

42

Texas Archeolog~cal and Paleontological Society

for some purpose, this matter would be of great importance in understanding the origins of true mound-building in the eastern United
States.

Let us examine briefly the prevalent applications of this

term.
Along the Texas coast are many accumulations o[ catnp midden
and broken shell called "mounds" or "shell mounds." Sometimes
they lie on fairly level ground and attain a height of two or three
feet; when found as caps on natural knolls or sand dunes the total
height may be much greater.

In central Texas (principally the

Edwards Plateau and surrounding regions:from the upper Brazos
to the Nueces River) there are hundreds of "rock mounds" or "burntrock mounds." These represent heaped accunmlations, often vast in
extent, of the remains of limestone hearth slabs, used until broken
by heat and then discarded and replaced by new slabs or complete
new hearths. As these "mounds" occur near almost every spring ira
the region, and on the level terrace lands along the stremns and
river confluences, they represent occupation in certain favored spots
for long periods of time. Where the camp sites were exposed to
occasional overflow they often were repeatedly buried by silt and
gravel before much refuse and rock could gather. In other, less
exposed spots, the discarded rocks and midden refuse collected to
heights of as much as seven feet.

Therefore, those which attain

some height, a more or less definitely humped center, and a fairly
definite perimeter, are traditionally called "mounds," while shallow
or buried deposits are called "sites" or "camps."

There is no reason

to suppose that the great rock heaps were the result of any con~ious
building trait. Neither does the inclusion of occasional burials in
such rock middens lend reason to their being called "burial mounds."
An excellent example of the dangers of such terminology may be
seen in the case of the so-called "Morhiss Mound" (also called
"Waelder-Joshua Mound") in die Guadalupc River bottoms near
Victoria, Texas.

This site was excavated ira 1938-1.939 by- the WPA-

University of Texas Archaeological Survey, W. A. Duffen, Field
Archaeologist. While the site was called the "Morhiss Mound" in
all the field notds and catalogs, the actual dissection showed no
evidence of any conscious attempt to erect a mound. Rather, tim
site appeared to be composed of a huge midden capping over a gravel
bar left in the bend of an old course of the Guadalupe River. This

gravel bar rose several feet above the surrounding flat botto’mland
and doubtlessly provided a convenient dry spot for Indian tribes;
it also contained bones of many extinct animals.

It was used as a

camp site until a great cap of refuse from tw~ to six feet thick had
accumulated. Burials were made in it, over 200 being found by the
excavators. In this case, for many years before the main excavations,
the site had been known as a great "mound" and had been interpreted as evidence of mound-building practice about midway between
the Mexican border and the Mississippian cultures of east Texas.
This assumption was based mainly on the size and shape of the site,
without regard to whether it could have been erected purposely.
Thus, references to "Morhiss Mound" or "Guadalupe River burial
1hound" are not only inept, but have been falsely inferred as evidence of the diffusion of mound-building practices between Middle
America and the "Mound-Builders" of the eastern United States.
"Mound" has even been applied to some puebloan ruins in the
Southwest, to puebloan-like masonry ruins in the Texas Panhandle,
and to large refuse piles associated with village ruins. When walls
are badly collapsed and the ruins more or less filled with dust and
wash, the resultant pile of rubble might attain considerable area
and height. Perhaps no one would seriously consider a relation
between such a heap and actual m0und-building, but why is it necessary to employ such an ambiguous term as "mound" at all in such
circumstances ?
In the so-called "Caddo area" of northeast Texas, northwest Louisiana, southwest Arkansas, and southeast Oklahoma, the current
usages of the term "mound" are even more confusing than elsewhere.
For this area lies on the frontier of the vast eastern region in which
several forms of mound-building are positively known to have been
practiced, with certain developments traceable through several distinct culture periods. Largely due t~ the extraordinary influence
of Harrington’s "Certain Caddo Sites in Arkansas," which appeared
in 1920, a very large number of sites in this area have been called
"mounds." In a few cases this label is rather obviously correct
when applied to certain large eminences which rear up from flat
bottomland along the Red River and other major streams with wide
valleys. On the other hand, the same.term is commonly applied to
hundreds of other localities which turn out to be small heaps of

Texas Archeological and Pateontological Society

camp midden perhaps 30 feet across and six i~ches to" two feet high.
Thesd prove to be composed of sand or clay, ash, char, animal hone,
mussel shells, potsherds and other artifacts, and may or may not
include burials. Thus, the level sites are called "camps" or "camp
sites," while those of the same origin and composition but which
rise to a slight elevation, are known as "mounds" or "burial mounds."
One of the best known localities in northeast Texas is the so-called
"Sanders Burial Mound" on the T. M. Sanders place south of the
Red River in northwestern Lamar County. Excavations by the University of Texas did not reveal any substantial evidence of intentional
building, but rather the "mounds" (there are two adjacent eminences) seemed possibly to be nothing more than midden cappings
over natural knolls. The larger of these eminences yielded 21
graves ~ontaining 62 individuals, and hence was classed as a "burial
mound" by the excavators. Yet the field notes clearly state that the
bulk of the occupational refuse formed a cap over a small natural
ridge. Without satisfactory details on the internal structure of such
sites, the unconsidered label of "burial mound" again has misleading implications.
Fully as serious is the use of "domiciliary mound" in the Caddo
field, as employed by Harrington and many of his followers. In
many instances this name was given to a very small knoll formed on
more or less level ground by the collapse of an earth-covered house.
To call such a heap, usually but a few inches high, a "domiciliary
mound" is stretching the imagination and provides a direct Conflict
with the intended meaning of this term in eastern archaeology. For
elsewhere this term is considered to apply to an earth structure or
platform which can be shown to have been built up with loads of
clay taken from nearby "borrow pits." If the superimposed building conforms to dwellings, the platform becomes a "house mound"
or "domiciliary mound"; if evidence of perpetual fire, ahars, or
unusually large buiIdings is present, the earth structure becomes a
"temple mound."
Naturally, there is not always sufficient evidence on which to
classify artificial eminences. Nonetheless, careful dissection and
examination of th~ trench walls can usually reveal the difference
between intentional building (pockety construction as though earth
had been dumped by the basket-load) and growth incidental to oc-

cupation (lenticular construction, midden and ash layers, etc.).

It

does not help tc~ read in a report that such and such "mounds"
are "man-made."

This can be interpreted in two ways: man-rna~e

could mean either that the eminence was built by hand for a purpose,
or it could mean merely that the "mound" was not natural, i. e., was
due to human occupancy.

Wherever there is any possibility of doubt

or misunderstanding, the author should include a few sentences on
the composition of the site. If trench walls can be photographed
or diagrammed, this should by all means be done and included with
the published account.

It appears that in site terminology there are three principle alternatives. First, "mound" might be continued in the present lo~se
sense, simply to indicate that the site has some height to it. Or,
second, we could confine the term "mound" to just those eminences
which give satisfactory evidence of intentional construction. Third,.
the old term tumulus could be revived and applied to those particular sites which reveal intentional building, whether to cover large
graves, to provide platforms for buil~lings, or t~ fulfill some other
function, perhaps unknown. The use of tumulus would then carry
this definite meaning and could not be confused with the loose and
ambiguous label of "mound.’"

Regarding the distribution of purposely built mounds or tumuli
in Texas, there seem to be very few of these indeed. They are,
moreover on the basis of available evidence, completely restricted
to the northeastern corner of the state. In examining the field notes
and photographs of over three hundred east Texas sites, and visiting some personally, my opinion is that only five of them contain
good evidence of intentional building. These are: the A. J. Hatche!

"’Bird Points," "~lrrow Points," etc.
Certain terms for projectile points have very wide usage over
large parts of the United States.

The most curious is that of "bird

the latest archaeological horizons almost everywhere.

The term

is usually applied to points less than about Ia/2 inches in length.

ping are seen in specimens up t6 2 inches or even greater length.
In Texas everyone seems to recognize a sharp distinction between
these light "bird points" and the great numbers of heavier, longer,
thicker, and broader points found widely over virtually the whole
state.

The latter projectile points are thus called "arrow points"

and it is rarely indeed that one finds anyone who questions that
the heavy points were used on arrows.
There appear to be two general interpretations of the "bird
points."

One is that they were used on small arrows for small

game and birds, and thus constitute a special class of points used
in connection with the bow. The other is that "bird points" were
not used with the, bow and arrow at all, but were attached to the
tiny darts shot with a blowgun! Surely no one familiar with the
blowgun would believe for a minute that stone heads, even tiny
ones, could or would be attached to its darts. There is, moreover,
no reason to believe that a blowgun of any kind was used over the
vast areas of North America in which "bird points" are found.6
Now, it is of great importance toward understanding the history
of the bow in native American culture that this matter of projectilepoint terminology (and functional interpretation) be placed on a
realistic basis.

If it is true that light "bird points" and heavy

"arrow points" do indeed represent nothing more than two spe.
cialized uses for the bow and arrow, then the bow must be of considerable antiquity in America, for the heavy "arrow points" are
found in the earliest definable horizons.

Various persons have

built bows of different weights, and with them shot arrows of
different size and length, and concluded that all the stone projectile
points (except the very heavy ones probably used on spears) could
be shot with bows without weighting down the arrows too much.
These assumptions and experiments, while interesting and

chal-

!enging, nevertheless do not conform to commonly known archealogical facts.

6. Another curious term for light, thin projectile points is that of
"mierolith."
As originally used in the ~Mediterranean area, this term is
sometimes used to designate small chipDed stone teeth fitted into sickle
blades, or as a general term for a small-artifact industry.
CertainIy, it is
completely meaningless as a projectile-point term in any area.

48

Texas Archeologtcal and Paleontological Society

It is very easy to demonstrate, both by archaeological and by
ethnological data, that the so-callear "bird points" are in fact true
arrow points, and that they are, furthermore, the only points that
can be positively associated with the bow in American culture history. For example, anyone interested in the subject can examine
arrows collected from various American tribes in the larger ethnological museums, and he will find that arrows, if they bear any
stone heads at all, will have very light, thin heads which, found
archaeologically, would unhesitatingly be called "bird points."
Not all arrows have chipped stone heads, of course, for many of
them are merely sharpened sticks, or are constructed of cane with
pointed hardwood foreshafts. On the archaeological side. whole
and fragmentary arrows have been removed from dry caves in
many parts of the country; again, where the projectile can be positively identified as an arrow, the point will either be a sharpened
stick or will have a light "bird point" attached or associated in
the same deposit.
As for the heavy, broad, thick points commonly called "arrow
points," it can be equally demonstrated that they were not used on
arrows and their presence does not indicate the use of thc bow.
Again, in dry caves and shelters in all the western states, whenever a
heavy point is found still attached to its shaJt, and tJ~e sturJt can
be identiJied, it proves to belong to an atlatl dart. Thus, in Basketmaker cave sites, where we know positively 1hat the atlatl was used
and the bow was not, such chipped points as are found still halted
to their shafts belong to the heavy, broad category.

Conversely,

the "bird point" class are never found attached to atlatl dart shafts.
There are enogh specimens from the dry western areas to prove
this association almost beyond doubt.

Ethnologically, the point

can not be proved as in the case of arrows, for nowhere in the
United States did the native tribes continue the use "of the atlatl into
modern times.

Except among a few persons directly interested in the subject,
the atlatl has been greatly underrated in American archaeology.
If one accepts the interpretation that the vast numbers of heavy
projectile points found over nearly the entire continent are indeed
atlatl points and not arrow points, then it is certain that the atlatl

Some Suggestions on Archeological Ter~.s

49

was a very old and widespread propelling instrument in America.
Actually, arrows and darts7 are very similar projectiles--so similar,
in fact, that the bow may possibly be regarded as a new way of
projecting the same sort of missile. To judge from cave specimens,
both arrow and dart were feathered in the same way, and both were
made either with sharpened wooden foreshafts or chipped stone
points. On the whole, the dart is a longer and heavier projectile
than the arrow. It usually ranged from 41/~ to 51/2 feet in length,
as against 20 to 30 inches for the arrow. In diameter the dart
ranges from ½ inch to’ ~ or even 8~ inches, the arrow from 1/~ to
’~ inches. The most certain diagnostic feature lies in the butt of the
projectile, the dart having a small cup to fit against the hook at
the dista! end of the atlatl, the arrow having a nock for fitting
against the bow string.
I do not mean to’ imply that there is invariably a clean distinction between the size and weight of chipped points used with the
arrow and dart. There are several intermediate sizes which might
have belonged to either, and in some cases some proof would be
needed in the form of halted specimens to reach a decision. Thin,
too, there is ample evidence that when the bow and arrow entered
various sections of the country, the atlatl was continued in use along
with it. This contemporaneity of the tw~ propelling instruments
probably led to experimentation in point styles best suited to certain
uses. Possibly some dart point styles were modified to suit the
strength and carry of the bow, and this circumstance would have
varied locally according to the type of bow in use. Among various
tribes the bo~r itself ranged from a very simple and weak form to
the powerful sinew-backed varieties.
Be this as it may, there is also a very decided chro~aological distinction between "bird points" and the heavier dart point.q. The
true arrow points with their light construction definitely appear at
a relatively late time in all sections of the country. In Texas, as
well as to the west, south, and east, arrow points appear in the
latest horizons, along with agriulture and pottery making. This
7. "Dart" is itself a rather I~oor term for the atlatl missile. Some such
term as "j,~velin" might be more appropriate. I-Iowever, archaeologist~
well agreed on the meaning of "dart" in the atlatl complex.

Tex~s Archeolog~cal and Paleontological Society

50

association varies in different areas but in Texas it.ll there is a
very close (if not absolute) agreement in the appearance of arrow
points, pottery, and agriculture, in all parts of the state.

Dart points,

on the other hand, are very numerous in the cultures which precede
this general horizon, but continue to appear sporadically in the
late horizons.

For some reason, however, they do appear

(on

present evidence) to have passed out of use with the beginning of
historic cultures.
In Texas archaeology, as elsewhere, it is time that mere consideration be given to the possibilities of the bow-atlatl relationship
and its connections with the habits and economy of the various
native peoples.

In a recent paper by Ray and Sayles the terminology

of projectile points has been given very accurately and should be
continued by other workers.8

They correctly use the term "arrow

points" instead of the obsolete "bird points" in their latest culture
periods, and "dart points" for the heavy varieties which have long
been incorrectly termed "arrow points" by other workers.

Ray has,

in fact, been using the term "’dart" for certain types of Abilenc
projectiles for many years.
Burial Terminology
In the various reports on Texas archaeology, burials are described by such terms as "flexed," "folded," "doubled," "sitting,"
"bunched," "bundle," etc.

As several of these are ambiguous, . it

might be well to suggest that only those terms commonly accepted
by American archaeologists be used.

Thus "flexed°’ should be used

for any burial placed in a horizontal position with tim knees drawn
up toward the abdomen.

"Sitting" should not be u~d as synony-

mous with "flexed" unless the body was actually placed upright
in the grave in a true sitting position, a very rare practice ac.ywhere
and probably unknown in Texas.

"Bunched" has been used to de-

scribe both "flexed" and re-buried skeletons.

If the

bo~es are

actually so mixed that they must have been gathered from one grave
and dumped into another, the term "bundle" is the commonly accepted one, and "bunched" should not be u~d at all.

burials laid at length, the term "extended" has common acceptance.
"Met~¢e’" versus "Seed Slab"
Much needless confusion has been caused by the to~ prevalent
use of the name "metate" for any kind of a grinding slab.

Over vast

areas of America a grinding process was used by many tribes who
had no knowledge of cori~ growing, but who used a simple, unshaped, flat stone for a platform and any convenient stream pebble
for a hand stone in order to smash and grind ~eds, berries, bulbs,
etc.

This hand stone was used with a rotary motion, and tl~is

method of grinding was known to many American natives before
agriculture and corn grinding appeared.

Corn grinding, on the

other hand, as practiced by the Puebloan and Mexican Indians, involved a back-and-forth motion on a fairly flat slab or one with a
rectangular depression in which the mano was pushed back and
forth. Such a mano was used with either one or two hands, and
the slab itself was generally brought to a rectangular shape by
chipping its edges.
At the Third Round Table Conference in Mexico City in the
summer of 1943 it was generally agreed that the term "metate"
should be applied only to the corn-grinding i~nplement of ~oughly
rectangular shape and a back-and-forth motion with either one or
two hand mano.

The simple unshaped slabs in which round or oval

basins are worn with a rotary motion should, accordingly, not be
called "metates" at all, but by such a term as "seed slab." Thus,
of all the grinding implements found in Texas from one end to the
other, true metates are known only in the west, Panhandle, and
north-central parts.

Moreover, they are probably confined to the

relatively late horizons and reflect influence from tire Puebloan
Indians.

This matter requires further study.

Tire tendency to treat

"metate" as synonymous with grinding is only obscuring an important archaeological problem.
It is hoped that the above notes will aid in bringing greater coordination into Texas archaeology and its relations with surrounding
areas.

A SECOND HISTORIC CADDO SITE AT
NATCHITOCHES, LOUISIANA
Bxr C. H. WE~B
Comparatively few sites have been found in the historic Caddo
territory which exhibit the association 0f native artifacts and European trade materials, despite the extent of this territory and the
existence of trade contact with Caddo tribes for over a hundred
years in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
ticularly true of historically identified sites.

This is par-

The obvious impor-

tance of such materials in delineatlng the artifact types of the historic Caddo tribes and establishing their relationships to the materials found at the hundreds of pre-histori¢ sites in the area justifies
the present report of a second Natchitoches site.

In 1935 Walkert .described the burials and artifacts which had
been discovered during construct.ion of the Fish Hatchery on Cane
River one mile below Natchitoches, Louisiana, noting that in all
probability the site was that of the Natchitoches Indians during
existence of the French fort at this town, which was established in
1714. Trade beads and metal tools were found in burials with
native pottery. A marked similarity was noted by Walker
tween the engraved Natchitoches ware and numerous vessels illustrated by Mo’orez from the Keno and Glendora sites on Bayou
Bartholomew and the Ouachita River above Monroe, Louisiana.
He states that this similarity is explained historically by Henri de
Tonti’s account of finding the "Ouasita" and "Nachitoches" together at the latter’s village and also by La Fon’s map of the Territory of Orleans in 1806, on which the old trading path from
Natchitoches t6 the villages on the Oua~hita is shown. Walker
cites other historical details of the early white contacts with the
Natchitoches Indians and the Doustiony, a related tribe, both
whom lived at .various places on Cane and Red Rivers near Natchitoches until after 1805.
Walker quotes Dunn3 as explaining the maze of rivers and
bayous in this vicinity (Plate 9) by stating that the Natchitoches
island known to the early French explorers, about 50 miles long by

A Second Historic Caddo Site at Natchitoches, La.

53

3 or 4 miles wide, was formed by Cane River on the west and
Rigolette de Bon Dieu on the east.

Originally flowing through a

channel now referred to as Old River (see Plate 9) Red River cut
through into Cane River about 176.5 and then in 1832 broke into
Rigolette de Bon Dieu, which it follows today as far as the town
of Colfax.

Nicholas King’s’~ map of Red River in Louisiana, embodying the
findings of the Freeman-Custis expedition of 1806, shows the main
channel of the river~at that time t6 course through the present Cane
River in agreement with Dunn’s statement. A north branch is shown
corresponding to the Rigolette mentioned by Dunn and following
the present channel of the Red River.
Walker1 states that St. Denis described the old village of the
Natchitoches as being on an island formed by the separation of
the river into two branches which reunited farther downstream.
No indication is given whether this island is the early "Natchitoches
Island" between the present channels of Red River and Cane River
or the island between Cane and Old Rivers (Red River channel
before 1765). It will be noted on the map (Plate 9) that the
Fish Hatchery site and the Lawton site to be described are t6 the
west of Cane River, hence on the island between it and Old River,
but not on "Natchitoches Island."
The Loavton Site

During the summer of 1944, Mr. A. G. Lawton of Natchitoches
was engaged in constructing a cotton gin on his plantation situated
on the west bank of Cane River, eight miles below Natchitoches,
between Natchez and Bermuda (Plate 9). Excavations for the
foundation struck some six or seven burials, several of which conrained Indian pottery or glass beads. These were found only across
the sour,~west corner of the gin (Plate 10, No. !) almost paralleling
the shore of Cane River and about 200 feet from the stream. Mr.
Lawton states that the burials were almost in direct line, with
practically all of the heads directed toward the southeast. One
vessel was stated to have been alongside the chest, the others all
near the heads. Several groups of beads were found, generally
at the neck, although a workman states that a few were found at
the wrist of one skeleton.

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

54

About ten days later I had the opportunity, through the kindness
of Mr. Lawton, of being present and salvaging artifacts during
further excavations for a scale platform on the northwest side o~
the gin, where three additional burials were found.

Unfortunately

the season was advanced and haste was necessary in getting the gin
completed before harvesting season, hence a tractor and scraper were
used in excavating for the scale pit, resulting in serious damage to
the burials.

When burials were struck, however, I was permitted

to work out the details while grading continued elsewhere, so that
a majority of the artifacts, though damaged, was saved. The skeletal
material, especially the skulls, was beyond reconstruction and only
gross details could be observed under the circumstances.

Permis-

sion has been granted to conduct more leisurely excavations in the
adjoining areas after the crops are gathered and we have hopes of
securing skeletal material for study.
The burials were found at an average depth of 2 to 3 feet, within
or just beneath a heavy layer of clay, which is overlaid by some
18 inches of sand, undoubtedly deposited from overflows when this
stream was a main channel of Red River.

A cursory examination of the surrounding area showed no evidence of surface artifacts, although grass on the gin plot and crops
in the adjacent fields interfered. It is possible that overflow sands
have covered all surface materials. I am told that human bones
were struck by the p!ow in an adjoining field and that other bones
have been plowed up in a field some three or four hundred yards
downstream.

Buria!s
The upper portion of Burial 1 (Plate 10, No. 1) had been removed
during the original excavations for the gin, only a few trade beads
having been found at the neck.

The intact leg bones indicated the

extended burial o~[ an adult in the supine position, the head directed
southeast.

The right femur was markedly thickened in its upper

portion, with very roughened surface, giving the appearance of a

healed osteo-periostifis or infected fracture.

57

The tibiae showed no

evidence of syphilitic infection.
Burial 2, an adult (probably female), 62 to 64 inches in length,
was about 8 feet west of the gin wall, lying supine and fully extended with the head toward the southeast. The skull was struck
and badly crushed. Above and to each side of the skull were a
small bottle (Plate 11, No. 2) and fragments of a bowl (Plate 11,
No. 3).
Burial 3 was that of a child, apparently 3 to 4 years of age, fully
extended in the supine position with the head directed northwest.
A group of 12 trade beads was found at the neck and a single pottery vessel (Plate 11, No. 4) was above and to the right of the
skull.

The vessel had been intact but the neck was carried away by

the scraper and could not be found.

The hones which remained

showed no’ evidence of disease.

Burial 4 was that of an infant, found near Burial 3, and was
so badly disturbed that details of artifact placement are not definite.
Fragments of two pottery vessels, both showing old breaks, were
found near the skull. These were a redware bowl (Plate 11, No. 5)
and the body of a bottle or jar (Plate 11, No. 6). A group of 20
beads was found at the neck.
ArtiJacts

It is to be noted that no objects of metal, stone or shell were
found, differing from the Fish Hatchery site, where Walker
ports the finding of shell beads, stone arrow points and celts, metal
scissors, hawkbetls, bracelets and an iron spike. The limited number of burials so far uncovered at the Lawton site may account for
this difference.
The beads (Plate 10, No. 2) have not been submitted to experts
but none has the appearance of native beads, some being evidently
glass, others possibly are of a porcelain compound. Of the 35 which
I have seen, 27 are of various shades of blue, sometimes with longitudina! white stripes; 7 are white, 4 of these having stripes of various
colors; and 2 are red. The cut or worn ends of the red beads show
that the body is made of a very dark material with a thin red sur-

58

face coating. Most of the beads are round or oval, but two are
oblong, 12 to 15 ram. (1-2 to 5-8 inch) in length. Diameters
generally average 6 to 8 ram. (1-~ to 5-16 inch) with extremes of
2 ram. and 1 cm.
The eight pottery vessels are all shell tempered, as are four
sherds which were found in the soil near a burial. The paste is
generally firm or slightly brittle, with surface leaching of the shell
to produce a porous or roughened appearance in some instances.
Two of the bowls and one bottle are of softer paste, so that they
break or suffer leaching more readily. The vessels are light, with
wall thickness of 4 to 5 ram., and are comparatively small, the
greatest diameter being 16 cm. (6¼ in.). Surface coloration varies
from an orange tinted buff to" a dark brown, except for the red
slipped vessel described below.
One entire vessel and portions of two others were saved by Mr.
Lawton from the first burials and were kindly loaned to me for
study. The unbroken specimen (Plate 10, No. 3) is a cup, 9.2 cm.
in height, 8 cm. in diameter, of firm, slightly porous ware which
has a tan surface color. The base is circular and flat; the body is
decorated with vertical incised lines; the narrow rim flares moderately. The short neck has a projecting rounded collar bearing two
parallel rows of punctates. Vessels of similar shape, often larger,
with vertical incised lines have been found at several sites in the
hills bordering Red River Valley above Natchitoches, although such
vessels or sherds are clay tempered and in association with a punctate-incised ware typical of these sites. Similar vessels, both shell
and clay tempered, were found at the Belcher Mound site in Caddo
Parish.5
A second vessel (Plate 10, No. 4) is represented by the basal
half which is. 16 cm. in diameter. The small part of the decoration
present consists of parallel, curving, roughly engraved lines. It is
very similar in appearance to that illustrated by Walker1 in Plate

rim.

temper shows on the surface, which is smooth but not highly polished, and is dark brown in color. The base is circular and not
flattened; the narrow rim curves outward and is separated from the
body by a rounded collar. The engraved decorations cover the rim
and body, the chief motif, five times repeated, being a scroll with
recurred ends formed by a medially bisected band. Spaces bordering the scrolls are filled by negative discs and hatched or cross
hatched triangles. The rim bears a negative meander, outlined by
small arcs and also medially bisected by a spurred or dentate line.
Details of the decoration appear in Plate 12, No. 2.
Vessel 1 (Plate 11, No. 2) of Burial 2 is a small bottle, 8 cm. in
height, 6.5 cm. in body diameter and 3.8 cm. at the orifice.

The

paste is firm with fine shell tempering, the surface is pitted or
vacuolated from leaching of shell particles, the surface color is
orange tinted tan with black areas from differential firing.

The

base is small, circular and flat; the body is globular with flattened
shoulders; the neck is short with rounded collar and flaring rim.
Parallel lines encircle the shoulder and base, while the body surface
between these lines bears a design (Plate 13, No. 1), four ti~nes repeated, of interlocking scroll bands above and below a meander,
all formed by trailed lines.

The interlocking scroll

bands are

formed by three parallel lines.

Vessel 2 (Plate 11, No. 3) of Burial 2 is an open bowl, 16 cm. in
diameter at the lip and 8 cm. in height, with 3 to 4 ram. tbicknes~
of walls. The paste is inferior, being porous and badly leached,
splitting easily. A few surface areas evidence a former polish.
The small circular base is semi-flattened; the body is a modified
hemisphere; the rim continues the outward flare of the upper body
to terminate in a rolled lip. The engraved decoration, three times
repeated, features a double scroll (Plate 13, No’. 2) with folded
ends and joined at a right angle at the vessel ba~. The adjacent
scrolls interfit and the intervening spaces are filled by negative
discs. The rim has a rectilinear stepped pattern, the steps corresponding to spaces between the body scrolls. Spurred or dentate
lines bisect the feature bands on both body and rim.

Spaces above, below and between the scrolls are filleM by

parallel vertical arcs.

Vessel 1 of Burial 4 (Plate 11, No. 5) is a beautiful small bowl
of yellow paste covered with a bright red slip which has flaked
off in some areas. The diameter is 14 cm. the height 6.8 cm. The
small circular base is flat; the body semi-globular; the rim flares
outwardslightly and terminates in a rolled lip. The engraving
shows the yellow paste through the red background, but is slightly
irregular, the design being unbalanced. The chief design motif
is a folded meandering band, the meanders being five times repeated around the vessel (Plate 14, No. 2). A second meander is
pendant from the shoulder and a third appears on the rim, each
of the three being medially bisected by a spurred line. Intervening
spaces are typically filled by discs, ovals and hatched areas.
Vessel 2 of Burial 4 (Plate 11, No. 6) is the globular body of a
bottle, 9.5 cm. in height and diameter. One small neck sherd shows
an outward convexity, indicating the typical bulbous neck found
on similar vessels at Keno and Glendora. The paste is soft with
brown surface coloration, the surface smooth but not burnished.
The engraved decoration (Plate 12, No. 1) is comparatively simple,
a three line curving panel featuring interlocking ~rolls, five times
repeated, and outlined above and below by vertical or diagonal arcs.

The similarities of shape, size, temper and decorative patterns
between this pottery and the vessels described by Walkerl from the
Fish Hatchery Site, as well as the presence of trade materials in
each instance, indicate cultural identity.

The historical evidence

outlined by Walker certainly justifies the presumption that they
are to be attributed to the Natchitoehes Indians, an historic Cadda
tribe, or to the closely related Doustiony who lived along the river
in this same area, remaining here even when the Natehitoches temporarily moved south to reside with the Acolapissa (Swanton‘$)
and uniting with the Natchitoches in later years.
Natchitoches Pottery Types
On the basis of comparative study of the vessels from the Fish
Hatchery and Lawton sites at Natchitoches and the culturallywas
well as historicallywaffiliated Keno and Glendora sites ~n the
Ouachita, we may safely delineate certain pottery types which are
characteristic of these historic

Caddo tribes.

Using decorative

method and desi~ elements as the chief criterion, and vessel shape
as a lesser, two types may be distinguished.

In the first type, which

Ford and others6 at Louisiana State University have called Natchitoches Negative Meander, but which Krieger7 and the writer prefer
to call Natchitoches Engraved, may be grouped the engraved bowls,
platters and bottles, featuring as typical motifs the meander and
the scroll--interlocking, folded, redoubled---both usually formed
by negative bands which are medially bisected by a spurred (dentare) line.

These major motifs are flanked or outlined by negative

discs, arcs, hatched or cross-hatched areas, the decoration covering
the entire or major part of the external surface.

A high percentage

of the vessels has shell tempering although some vessels show absence of recognizable temper. Vessels of this type are often covered
with red slip or pigment ~red or white) may be inserted into d~e
engraved lines.

The major design elements may be repeated three,

four or five times around the vessel.
The typical bowl is open and shallow, with moderately flaring
rirn, although bowls with vertical walls or vertical rims arc occasionally seen.

Inslanting rims are rare, the one vessel of this type

(Moore2, Fig. 149) which appears at Keno having the characteristics of Belcher Engraved5 and

probably

representing

a

pre-

historic burial or trade vessel.

The bottles of Natchitoches En-

graved, illustrated in Plates 10, No. 4, 11 No. 6, and 12 No. 1 of this
report, Plate 5 b of Walker’s report1 and Figs. 16, 17, 20, 21, 71
and 131 and Plate II of Moore’s report from the Ouachitaz are
globular or squat, with short bulbous necks and slightly flaring
rims.

The several long-necked bottles from the Ouachita sites do

not have characteristic decorations and are suspected of being prehistoric or trade pieces.

It is certainly evident at these sites that

.intrusive vessels from at least the Natchez (Figs. 58, 80, 154) and
Belcher (Fig. 149) types occur.

The bottles have the complicated meander and scroll patterns
described for the bowls, covering most of the body surface, although the necks are undecorated. The spurred line does not appear
so regularly as on the bowls. Tripod bottles (Moore Fig. 71) are
rare. Effigy bottles are illustrated from Glendora (Moore, Plate
I) and Keno (Moore, Plate VII), both red-slipped and the latter
a tetrapo’d vessel. Pot shapes bearing the Natchitoches Engraved
type of decoration are unusual (Moore, Fig. 65 and Plate IV).
Many of the bottles from the Ouachita sites are highly polished and
red filming was frequent. Such highly ornate bottles have not been
found at the Natchitoches sites, but WalkerI describes three such
vessels, illustrated in articles by Beyer and Jones, found in sites
between Natchitoches and Shreveport.
The second pottery type, which we call Keno Trailed, is typically
a small to medium size bottle, with bulging or cylindrical neck,
decorated with numerous closely placed trailed lines, featuring
meanders, scrolls, concentric circles and arcs, and other curvilinear
designs. Numerous examples are illustrated by Moore~ from Glendora (Figs. 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22-26, 81) and Keno (Figs.
129, 130, 141). They are not illustrated by Walker in the Fish

Hatchery report, but the two specimens from the Lawton site (Plates
tl, No. 2, 11 No. 4, 13 No. 1, and 14 No. 1) establish this type
at Natchitoches. Other vessel forms which have Keno Trailed
designs include the open bowl (Glendora Fig. 55) and the vase
(Greer site on the Arkansas River., Moorelz Figs. 62 and 67).
Other Sites Showing Natchitoches Pottery Types

Fordlo excavated at the Alien Plantation and Wilkinson place in
the western fringe of hills bordering the Red River Valley above
Natchitoches. Both sites showed trade materials, either with the burials or in surface finds. Most of the, decorated vessels from both sites
bore incised or punctated designs, but at the Wilkinson place, Neild
had previously secured the typical Natchitoches Engraved bowl illustrated by Ford10 in his Analysis of Village Site Collections from
Louisiana and Mississippi (Fig. 17, page 92).
Dickinson8 described several vessels from the Clements site in
Northeast Texas, where trade contact was evidenced by the presence
of glass beads with the burials. Two of the vessels (Plate 19)
could be classed as Natchitoches Engraved, a third has deeply
trailed lines forming a geometric instead of the curvilinear designs
of Keno Trailed. He quoted Jackson9 who described other vessels from the same site:
"The designs include sun symbols, interlocking scrolls, one swastika, raised lines, fingernail imprints and incised triangular designs.
The workmanship shows a fair degree of excellence. Certain designs
show a marked similarity to some from Louisiana and Arkansas.
as pictured by Moore."
Dickinson states "Inasmuch as the Clements place was not a great
distance from the Cadodachos settlements which Bolton lo’cates in
the vicinity of Texarkana, one would expect the pottery to be
representative of the Great Caddo."

Jackson9 mentions six ottmr sites in East Texas at which trade
materials were found. At the Womack site on Red River, in Lamar
County, numerous metal objects as well as glass beads were found.
Most of the pottery was crude but two large bowls were well made.
One had cross hatched triangles pendant from band lines; the
other is described as having intricate interlocking scrolls between

bands, similar to a number of bowls from a prehistoric site in
Harrison County, Texas.
Moore~ ~ illustrates three bottles and several bowls (Figs. 58-60,

decoration conform to the type Natchit~ches Engraved.

M.P.

Miroir of Texarkana has a large number of vessels from this site,
all (like those illustrated by Moore) coming from burials in the
fields surrounding the large mound.

One or two other vessels from these sites represent types

found at the Belcher Mound.

Trade materials appear at the Douglas

site and probably at Greet.
Hctdges and Hodges13 recently described pottery from the Watermelon Island site on Ouachita River in Hot Spring County, Arkansas. Two mounds and a large number of village sites on the
1,100 acre island have afforded pottery of numerous types, but the
authors state "The Caddoan complex predominates."

Frorn burials

on the village sites they secured a number of ves~ls, some of
which they describe as having typical Natchitoches or Glendora
decorations, while the descriptions of other vessels tallies with ~veral types described by Do’dd and myself5 from the Belcher site
(Belcher Engraved bottles and bowls, Cowhide (formerly Belcher)
Stamped and Foster Trailed-Incised). They state that no trade
objects have been found on the island.
Krieger7 states that the A. J. Hatchel mound on Red River just
west of Texarkana, entirely free of trade materials, had one in-

trusive burial with vessels similar to Natchitoches Engraved, and
50 sherds from the topmost level which were elassified as Natchitoches Engraved, Keno Trailed and Menard Puncture.

The lat-

ter is a type which sometimes is found with Natchitoches Engraved
and Keno Trailed and is illustrated in Figs. 14, 18, of Moore’s12
Arkansas River report and in Figs. 61 and 68 of his Ouachita report.z Krieger states that these findings indicate a brief occupation of the Hatchel site by protohistoric Caddo of the Glendora Focus
(the classificatory name under which he groups Natchitoches, the
two Ouachita sites and others with identical ~naterials).

In his

opinion the Hatchel site could quite possibly have been the upper
Nasoni village and tribe shown by Swanton4 (1942, Fig. 1) in approximately the same position on Red River.
The prehisto’ric pottery at the Belcher Mound site in Caddo
Parish, Louisiana, (Webb and Do~td5) shows interesting relationships to the later Natchitoches and Glendora wares. The engraved
and trailed types at Belcher rarely have shell temper, more frequently having clay, tufa or no recognizable temper at all. The
paste is more homogeneous and generally darker in color than the
Natchitoches wares.

Among thirty odd bottle forms, two small

specimens have pedestal bases, short tubular necks and a smoothl,
trailed curvilinear design typical of Keno’ Trailed (see Webb and
l)odd, Plate 171) ; all of the others have long necks, and globular
or sub-globular bodies with engraved designs.

Three of the bottles

have scroll or meander designs with spurred lines and negative
discs, suggestive but not typical of the Glendora bottle designs.

Of

the five prevalent bowl types, two (formerly part of Belcher Engraved, but now separated as Taylor Engraved as also is the type
shown ira Plate 15, 4) have inslanting rims which are decorated
with scroll bands or meanders, outlined by negative discs and sometimes by cross hatched spaces (Webb and Dodd~ Plate !5, 2 and 3).
Most of the~ vessels have undecorated body surfaces, but three
show decoration with trailed concentric circle or spiral motifs.
Shell temper is absent in these Belcher carinated bowls and the
walls are very thin, often 2 to 3 ram. thick.

Spurred line bisection

of the ~roll bands is frequent and white or red pigment is usually
inserted into the lines.

One vessel is red filmed.

One small fl~t

bowl, differing from any of the others, has a three line interlocking

Texas Archeological and PaleontoZogical Society

7O

scroll design covering most of the body surface outlined by punetates.
It is clay tempered, fired black and has white pigment in the lines.
One would class it definitely as Natehitoches Engraved.
Two tall jars (Webb and Dodd, Plate 15, 6) have high vertical
rims decorated with engraved interlocking ~rolls, outlined by negative discs. The shapes are entirely atypical of Natchitoches Engraved, but the decorative features are very similar. This vessel is
also listed at present as Taylor Engraved.
There is a conceivable relationship between Foster Trailed-Incised
vessels (Webb and Dodd, Plate 17, 2) and Keno Trailed vessels.
The vessel shapes are entirely different, but there is a similar conception of parallel curvilinear trailed lines covering a major part
of the vessel, with the design motifs repeated 3, 4 or 5 times around
the vessel.
We may conclude, then, that the Belcher Mound affords one
typical Natchitoches Engraved and two’ Keno Trailed vessels (clay
tempered) and shows numerous other possible relationships to or
influences on the later Natchitoches.Ouachita types.
Discussian
Considerable progress has been made in the past few years
toward bringing some order out of the welter of confusion concerning the artifacts, and especially pottery, found in the area
inhabited by the historic Southern Caddoan tribes, which covers
northwest Louisiana, southwest Arkansas, east Texas and portions
of Oklahoma.

Until a few years ago everything from this area

was likely to be ascribed to the Caddo Indians, with little areal or
temporal discrimination.

The chronological studies of F6rdlo, 1,

and his associates at Louisiana State University were of considerable help, but they primarily involved central Louisiana and Mississippi, and only a few north Louisiana sites were considered.
Lemley15 and Lemley and Dickinson16 first gave definite indication of a Pre-Caddo culture (later identified as Coles Creek) at the

Go’ldschmidt17

had previously

suggested

a

chronological sequence of Caddo pottery types in northeast Texas
on the basis of differences in pottery types, burial customs and the
fortuitous finding of an intrusive burial pit which transsected a
previous placement.
Since this time excavations have been conducted by the Universities of Texas and Oklahoma in these states, some others under
government projects and others by individuals in the four state
area.

Conferences and exchange visits helped to clarify interrelated

problems. Krieger7 of the University of Texas, after study of the
very large collection at this institution, field notes of archaeological
projects especially at the Hatchel and Davis sites, visits and conferences in each of the related areas, has recently suggested a classification based on the MeKern System, to" be used as a basis for
further study and clarification. It has been my privilege to consult
with him on a number of occasions, particularly concerning the
classification of sites and typology of artifacts from northwest
Louisiana, as well as to visit the major collections of the four
state area, and it is my opinion that his summary will be immensely
valuable to future w~rkers.
Krieger establishes two aspects, the earlier Gibson and the later
Fulton.

The Gibson Aspect includes the Spiro Focus, of which com-

ponents besides the Spiro Mound are present in six Oklahoma and
two northeast Texas counties; the Haley Focus, components of which
include the Haley and one component of the Crenshaw Mound on
Red River in Arkansas (Moorel1 and LemleylS), stage I of the
Hatchel Mound on Red B.iver west of Texarkana and the Mineral
Springs, Washington and Site i of Ozan, described by HattingtonI 8; the Gahagan Focus, including the Gahagan Mound (Moore] 1
\Vebb and Dodd19) in Red River Parish, Louisiana, and possibly
smaller sites in the same area; the Alto Focus, including the Davis
Mound site in Cherokee County and several other sites in MeLenhen, Naeogdo’ehes, Angelina and San Augustine Counties, Texas;
the Sanders Focus, including the T. M. Sanders site in Lamar

County and other sites in Van Zandt, Hopkins and Wood Counties.
Texas.
To a varying degree in the different fool, the Gibson Aspect is
reported by Krieger to exhibit such traits as: construction of platform tumuli, more frequently rectangular; burial tumuli; burial
complex of multiple burials, often in very large pits, with large
group offerings along wails or in corners of pits; pottery with
clay, sand or bone (no shell) temper, including fine line engraving
of polished vessels, curvilinear incised wares, varying plain or
puncxated wares, square-botto~ed vessels and frequent evidence of
Cotes Creek as a precedent, accompanying or influencing pottery
type; long stermned pottery pipes; effigy pipes of stone or pottery;
carved or incised conch shell dippers and gorgets; copper plaques,
ear spools, ~nasks or beads; ear spools of shell, wood, pottery or
stone; spatulate celts; quartz crystals and galena nodules; white
sandstone hones; finely made bone pins and awls; Copena type
blades; small

(arrow)

points more com~non than larger

(dart)

points.
The Fulton Aspect as outlined by Krieger, includes the Texarkana
Focus, with components at stage I1 of the Hatehel Mound, nine
others in Bowie, Cass, Titus, Franklin and Red River counties in
Northeast Texas and the Ozan sites 11 and 15 described by Harrington~a; the Belcher Focus, including also the McClure, Friday
and Foster mound sites on Red River in Arkansas (Moore~ ~), one
component each at the Battle and Crenshaw sites in the same area,
and one component of the H. R. Taylor, Cash and J. M. Riley sites
in East Texas; the Titus Focus, including eleven sites in Titus, Morris and surrotmdiug counties in Northeast Texas;

the Frankston

Focus, prehistoric, and historic Asinai, in a large hum}mr of sites
in Anderson, Cherokee, Nacogdoches and surrounding counties in
central east Texas; the Glendora Focus, including Glendora, Keno,
Natehitoches, and the last oecupational component at Battle, Greet
and Douglas sites in Arkansas, Clements. Hunt and Womaek sites

in East Texas. Suggested as probable additional loci in the aspect,
although not well delineated as yet, are the McCurtain, in southeastern Oklahoma, and the Bossier, in northwest Louisiana and extreme east Texas (hillside sites containing incised, punctated and a
few engraved pottery types).
Traits which in varying degree characterize the Fulton .Aspect sites
are: rare construction of tumuli; use of preexisting tumuli in some
instances; burial complex of single extended burials with vessels
around head, shoulders and occasionally around legs; pottery showing increasing frequency of shell tempering and red filming, numerous types of engraved, trailed, incised,

punetated and brushed

wares; square-bottomed vessels rare or absent; rattle bowls (hollow
knobs) and effigies on rims in the pottery of most loci; scroll
design motifs in al! except Frankston Focus; design predominantly
repeated four times; elbow pottery pipes; conch shell and mussel
beads; brown sandstone hones; spall scrapers with edge retouch;
perforated bear and canis teeth; small (arrow) points more prevalent than large (dart) points; circular house patterns with grouped
inner posts and projecting entrance-way (not invariable).
Krieger estimates that the Gibson Aspect existed approximately
between 1400 and 15~t0 A. D., contemporaneous with the latter
part of Ford and Willey’s~’z~ Temple Mound I (Coles Creek) period,
while the Fulton aspect covered the period from 1540 to the historic
era.
The Titus, McCurtain, Texarkaua and Belcher Foci would
occupy the earlier part of this period, intermediate between the
Gibson Aspect and the protohistoric-historic Caddo groups of the
Glendora Focus. The Frankston Focus would also reach the historic era as the Asinai tribes of east Texas.
While granting that the Fulton Aspect repre~nts prehistoric and
historic Caddo tribes in a continuous physical and cultural sequence,
Krieger questions the backward extension of such sequence to include the Gibson Aspect peoples as remote physical and linguistic
ancestors of the Caddo’s, despite evidences of continuity in the potteries.
With respect to the G/endora Focus, he states "The origins of
Glendora Focus pottery, omitting the filming and shell te~nper features, apparently are to be found in the wares of the prehistoric

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

Belcher and Titus Foci. The typical meandering band of Natchitoches Engraved, which doubles back on itself four times around
the vessel and is flanked with discs or cross hatched areas, seem
to have been anticipated in the four-times repeated scrolls of Ripley
and Taylor Engraved. Individual vessels of GIendora pottery are
sometimes difficult to distinguish from specimens of Taylor Engraved and certain Belcher site vessels."
Historical evidence has recently appeared which more definitely
established the Belcher Focus sites as prehistoric Caddo sites. Swanton’s4 valuable contribution of source material on the History and
Ethnology of the Cadda Indians (page 79) quotes the records of
the Freeman-Custis expedition of 1806, which with Caddo Indian
guides, proceeded up Red River until turned back by Spaniards
above the great bend (Fulton).
"On the evening of the 19th they passed a beautiful prairie, on
the north-east side of the river, 125 miles’* from the Coashutta V,.’Ilage.

This prairie was the site of an old Caddo village, deserted

by that nation in consequence of a surprise, and the massacre of
the greatest part of the inhabitants, by the Osage Indians.

The

Caddos with the exploring party, expres~d a wish to visit this place
when they were approaching it; and shewed a remarkable hill in
its rear, on which their old chiefs used frequently to meet in council.
¯ . . This remarkable mount or hill stands on a level plain about
two miles from the river, having the prairie on which the Caddo
Village stood in front, or between it and the river.

It is about two

miles in length, 250 or 300 feet in elevation, very narrow at the
top, in many places not exceeding two or three paces, and so steep,
that it is with difficulty it can be ascended .... This hill is an
irregular mass of iron colored porous rock, in which there are a
great number of small round pebbles .... In front of this mount
lies a beautiful and rich meadow, extending from its base to the
river and downwards for about two miles.

It is interspersed with

small clumps of trees and has a small pond or lake in its centre.
Around and near to this pond, are to be seen the vestiges of tho
Caddo habitations; it was the largest of their villages and their
" *By river travel, not direct.

A Second Historic Caddo Site at Natchitoches, La.

79

cultivated fields extended for five or six miles from it in every
direction."
The site is marked on the Nicholas King map reproduced by
Swanton and checking with Moore’s11 map of sites visited on the
Red River showed it to be in the vicinity of the Foster, Moore
and Dooley Ferry sites.

In comparry with Mr. M. P. Miroir of

Texarkana, who has collected from this area of Red River for
years, I went over this region last year, inquiring of local residents
as to such an unusual hill.

It was readily found, being a local

landmark, and corresponds to the description given by the expedition in all respects except as to height, which was somewhat exaggerated, as often occurred in the early narratives.

It is the only

hill in this region presenting an unbroken front of two miles on
the valley; I can attest to its steepness, having climbed it, and from
the narrow crest one has an unbroken view of the valley for miles.
In front of the hill is an old river cutoff, almost silted in, which
must be the lake referred t~ (the only type of lake which occurs
naturally in the Red River Valley) and at the junction of this old
river and the present river channel, two miles from the hill, is the
Foster mound site with extensive surface finds.

A limited search

by us and statements by local residents indicate the ab~nce of other
sites in this immediate vicinity.

This would reasonably identify

Foster site (a pure Belcher Focus component) as the deserted Caddo
village described in the Freeman-Custis report.
The Belcher Focus also, it seems to me, serves to bridge the gap
back to the Gibson Aspect in a line of cultural continuity, as we see
Jn this focus a carry over of distinctive Gibson cultural traits:
mound building; multiple burials in large or small pits; piling of
artifacts in the cornefs of pits; pearl beads; the use of copper
(limited to covering of ear plugs) ; large stone ear plugs; engraved
conch shell cups; carved shell gorgets; socketed antler-tip or bone
projectile points. These, with the obvious evidences of relationships in ceramics, indicate a more gradual and progressive transition
of culture than we would anticipate from the ~dden influx of new
peoples.

Conclusions
A second historic site near Natchitoches may be added to
previously described Fish Hatchery site, to the Glendora and Keno
sites on the Ouachita River and to the final component at the
Battle, Greet, Douglas and Watermelon Island sites in Arkansas
and the Clements, Hunt and Womack sites in Texas to’ constitute
the Glendora Focus of historic or protohistoric Caddo sites.

The

typical culture traits which distinguish this focus are: absence of
mound construction; residence directly on or near major streams
in fertile valleys; presence of trade artifacts in most instances; single burials, extended in the supine position; pottery placed by head
or upper body; head deformation; pottery types include Natchitoches Engraved, Keno Trailed and possibly Menard Punctate Banded; intrusions include Natchez (Fatherland 3-lined Incised), Belcher Engraved or Taylor Engraved; shell temper and red slip frequent; diminishing frequency or absence of stone artifacts.

The

Caddo tribes represented by this focus are thought to be derived
directly from those whose prehistoric remains constitute the Belcher and Titus Foci and possibly others of the Fulton Aspect.
Relationship with the more distant (culturally and temporally)
Gibson Aspect cultures is less evident, but may have occurred
through those of the Belcher Focus.

BONE IMPLEMENT BURIAL, COLLIN
COUNTY, TEXAS
By R. K. Hmams
While on a field trip to the upper part of Pilot Creek in May,
1942, the writer noticed file end of a bone protruding above the
surface.

Pilot Creek had just been out of its banks and had washed

the soil down to plow level.

On reaching down to pick up the

bone, it was found that it would not move because of being embedded in hard earth which had not been disturbed by cultivation.
Investigation proved the bone was part of a group of eight digging
implements belonging to a burial.
Description o] Size
This village site is located on the west side of Pilot Creek, about
eight miles above the junction of Pilot Creek and East Fork of the
Trinity River.

It is located on a small rise covering about five acres

of land. Flint, mussel shells, and bone debris indicates that the
site was occupied over a long period of tirne. In places, evidence
of camp debris extends to’ a depth of two feet.
Many fine projectile points, and scrapers have been found over
the surface of the site. They are of the same types as found in all
East Fork pottery sites.
have been found.

Several nice bone awls and bone beads

There are two peculiar facts concerning this site

which were als~ noticed at the Ragland Site, situated about 20 miles
down East Fork of the Trinity,

(The Ragland site was excavated

in January and February, 19402, by members of the Dallas Archaeological Society).

The pottery sherds, which were found at this

site, and at the Ragland site, run about 95 per cent plain undecorated sherds, and are heavily shell tempered.

At both sites pottery

is scarce, while at other East Fork pottery sites pottery is more
plentiful and runs about 40 to 50 per cent decorated. Bone work
at each o~ these two sites is very plentiful, while at other East

Fork pottery sites it is found, but is scarce. These two sites are
different from other East Fork pottery sites, and probably are related to each other. Further work at this site probably will show a
still closer relation to the Ragland site.
ButYl
Many burials have been plowed into by the farmer who cultivates
the land. The writer has observed several of these and all have
been buried in flexed position with no burial offerings. One
burial with shell beads has been reported from this site, but the
writer has been unable to interview the person who did the excavation. Upon uncovering this burial it was found that the skeleton was in flexed position, lying on the left side; the head was to
the east and the hands were covering the face. Throughout the
grave were many mussel shells and fragments of charcoal. The
burial offering was placed at the knees of the skeleton. In the
burial construction first a carefully made bed of mussel shells and
ashes was built. Then the ei~ht bone implements were arranged
on the bed of shells and ashes. Of all the burials the writer has
excavated on East Fork, this one seems to have been the most carefully planned of any. (See Plate 15)
The bone implements were placed in the following manner: Plate
16, No. ! (the discovery piece) was on top; then five were underneath this one in the following order, Plate 16, Nos. 2, 8, 5, 6, and
7. Then one (No. 4, Plate 16) was placed on edge on the norda
side and one (No. 3, Plate 16) was placed on edge on the south
side of the others. (See burial diagram, Plate 15).
Description of Bone Implements
All eight implements found with this burial were made from
scapulae of the bison. They are of two types: one type was made
to be used in the hand unhafted, and the other has a hole worked
in the top so that a handle could be inserted.
Type l---Unha]ted
Of the eight implements, two are of this type. They are plain
at the top and were probably used in the hand. Plate 16, Nos. 3 and

Boat-Shaped Objects, Val Verde and Bosque Counties

BOAT-SHAPED OBJECTS FROM VAL VERDE
AND BOSQUE COUNTIES, TEXAS
By CAI’..L
In 1939, at the suggestion of Dr. E. H. Sellards, Director of Texas
Memorial Museum at Austin, a small party was sent to the region
of the lower Pecos River for the purpose of excavating one or more
small rock shelters. Through the courtesy of Mr. Jess Cox permission was granted to explore his ranch on the Peeos River in an area
north of the town of Langtry. One small shelter was located and
completely excavated and a long stretch of the river was scouted.
In searching the thick and scattered refuse heaps located along the
lower edges of the limestone cliffs which are hardly above the
present stream level, a boat-shaped stone object was found on the
surface. As a surface find, its association with a definite focus,
whether intrusive or not, is not known. Surface artifacts in the
site appear to represent projectile points of both the Pecos River
and Chisos foci.~
The second specimen described in this paper is from Bo’sque
County, Texas, and is from the Jesse James Howard collection.
Both specimens have been found in recent years and represent finds
in counties in which boat-shaped stones or atlatl weights were not
kno’~’n at the time of publication of Patterson’s2 monograph on
boat-shaped objects of the Gulf Southwest States.
Terminology

In an attempt to use a terminology in describing boat-shaped
objects which is in keeping with the evidence which has accumulated
in recent years, the normal .position or functional orientation of
the stone should be considered. In this regard, it will be apparent that the writer has essentially reversed the portion of Patterson’s2 terminology in which he terms the plane or flat side the
base and the opposite the convex surface. On the basis of proper
orientation or position of the stone with respect to the under side
of the atlatl it appears that the flat or plane side would be regarded
as the upper or top surface and the convex surface the bottom or

lower surface.

This is also in general agreement with the manner

in which the stones are oriented in many publications.
Val Verde County Stone

This is a well polished specimen made of a green and white
banded lime silicate rock. The narrow white bands are calcium carbonate marble and the wider dull green bands are composed of
vesuvianite.

The stone is a metamorphic rock and could have

come from one of the several pre-cambrian areas of Texas or
possibly from some similar area outside of Texas. The base or
plane view is sub-quadrate or roughly elliptical in outline. A sidz
view is an isosceles triangle, base upward, with its ends truncated
at right angl.es to the base of the triangle. The upper or plane side
is slightly concave but the concavity is not pronounced. The stone
has a pronounced groove that passes around it at right angles to
the long axis. This grove is cut around the base and both sides
but does not traverse the upper or plane side. This feature indicates
that the groove was cut in the object to facilitate its attachment to.
some other object.
It is 2 inches in length, 1 inch wide at the center or widest point,
and 15-16 of an inch high.
Bosque County Stone

This is a skillfully made boat-shaped object and suggests the
name boatstone. The upper surface has been carved into a symPLATE 17

The ends are gently notched.

The

sides are almost vertical and the base is convex and flat.

The

material is a close-grained travertine (calcium carbonate) or algal
limestone.
The specimen is 31~ inches in length, 15-16 of an inch wide at the
center or widest point, and 1/12 inch high.

The trough is 1/~ of an

inch deep at the center of the stone.

Atlatl Weights
Evidence accumulates to show that the distribution of the atlatl
in the Americas was very widespread at one time.

Indeed, it varied

a great deal in form although the basic principle remained the
same.

In recent years a great deal of the mystery surrounding

many of the problematical stone objects such as boatstones, butterfly or banner-stones, prismatic stones, and bar weights, has been
cleared due to careful observation and new discoveries. The connection between the problematical forms named and the atlatl has
become apparent.
As early as 1893 Otis Mason3 described some atlatls from the
Southwest and stated that one had several objects attached to it
by wrappings.
In 1898 Starr4 described an additional atlatl from Utah that
had a luckstone or charm attached to it.- The "charm" was of
translucent quartz, flat on the atlatl contact side and convex on
the opposite side.
In 1919 Kidder and Guernseys described additional specimens
from their excavations in Arizona. In some cases the stones were
attached to the atlatt. In this article they stated that they believed
the stones were intended to ~rve as weights to improve the function
of the atlatl. Their work6 described in a later publication (1921)
is even more interesting. Two atlatls were found which had three
stones each attached to their backs.

In 1931 Guernsey7 described another specimen that had three
objects attached to it. Two of the three could be called weights.

96

Texas A~’cheolog~cal and Paleontological Society

In 1933 George Martin8 described an object from a cave in Va!
Verde County which he called, and it appears rightly so, the spur
of an atlatl. His was the first specimen of this type found in Texas.
In 1937 Patterson2 wrote his monograph on boat-shaped objects
from the Gulf Southwest States. This is an exhaustive study of all
of the available literature and artifacts up to that date. His thorough study led him to the conclusion that such objects were in most
instances attached to the underside of the atlatl but he stated that
"There is no way of knowing whether this practice had as its
object a purely utilitarian purpo~, or also carried with it the idea
of luck or charm."
In 1939 Fenenga and WheatS described lhe first atlatl that has
been found in Texas with a stone attached to it.
In the same year Webb and Haag1° published the results of
careful excavation and study of some graves in Kentucky which had
atlatl spurs in them. Of extreme importance, however, was the
position of the spurs with respect to the assorted shaped weights
in the graves. Their work showed tha~ the drilled weight~ were
mounted on the atlatl shaft with the spur. Their reconstructions
are noteworthy.
P~rpose of Weights
This point is not clear. That there is some doubt concerning the
actual usefulness of the stones of various shapes and weights is
reflected in the writings of several authors. They are considered
to be strictly utilitarian weights by some, and others look to them
as both a balancing weight and charm. To quote Patterson:2
"In the judgment of the writer, however, the general import of
these stones in the American Indian life is that they were used
primarily as weight stones bound to atlatls to give the weapon
additional weight and efficiency, and that in some instances, at
least, the motive of charm may be assumed."

With the evidence that has accumulated in the past few years, a
study of good copies of some of the specimens of various types
would, in all probability, aid in settling the question from the
standpoint of actual or intended benefit. The employment oi

97

stone attachments to at least two very different types of atlatls
should indicate in experiments whether the ’stone would actually
improve the efficiency or performance of the weapon.

SUGGESTION FOR IDENTIFICATION OF

CERTAIN MID-OUACHITA POTTERY
AS CAHINNIO CADDO
Bx" T. L. ~D M~ts. HOD~ES
Within the tentative confines of the Caddol-linguistie family of
the Lower Mississippi Valley Indians, the area of the Mid-Ouaehita2
basin has been archaeologically neglected heretofore. However,
recent activities in this section have revealed much archaeological
evidence of the historic horizon of its aboriginal occupants. Confusing is the prevalent dearth, almost absence,3 of associated objects of European origin. This apparent anachronism however is
justified in the record of the earliest histo’ry of this region; such
Old World products as axes, knives, guns, glass beads and brass
ornaments trickled very slowly into the northeastern Caddo territory, even after the stimulation of colonization by the French possession of the Mississippi Valley in the late seventeenth century.
Especially slow was such contact in the valley of the Middle
Ouachita River where the rugged hilly terrain obstructed the progress of the exploring Spanish, French or English. In tho interval
between the earliest Lower. Mississippi Valley discoveries by the
Europeans, and the later ones, Caddo cultural complexes had
changed.in both geographical location and physical aspects. Within the Caddo Confederacy, for instance, by 16874 the Kadohadach~
(Cadodacho, Cadadoquis) had established themselves on the big
bend of the Red 1River (Sabloniere5) ; the Tula,6 centering along
the headwaters of the Caddo River in 1541-1542 wl4en DeSoto
encountered them, had then disappeared; and the Cahinnio Caddo
had emerged in the Middle Ouachita River basin within a province
which apparently had formerly embraced in part both the provinces
of the Cayas and the Tula-Caddo of DeSoto’s passage.
The earliest documentation of the lower Mississippi Vglley history presents both a false and true beginning o~f European incursion
into the native cultures of southwest Arkansas. In 1541-1542, the
DeSoto Expedition established the first European contact with the
eastern provinces of the Caddoan Confederation, but only one

Identification o~ Mid-Ouachita Pottery as Cahinnio Caddo

99

member, a deserter,7 lingered to settle within the Caddo country.
Colonization was not DeSoto’s motive.

This initial brief impact

was fo’llowed by a historical blank of more than 140 years, which
was finally broken by the French exploring from the north.

LaSalle,

particularly, nurtured plans of future colonization to reinforce
France’s claim to the Mississippi Valley.

In 1687, M. Cavelier,8

brother of LaSalle, and his party of six sur~’ivors, passed through
the Kadohadacho and Cahinnio provinces from the Cenis country,
to report the ill-fated LaSalle expedition to their superiors in the
Illinois country.

This journey, recorded by Joutel, marked the true

beginning of European intrusion into the Mid-Ouachita area of
Caddoan culture.

The interlude between the DeSoto and LaSaile

explorations, although proto-hlstorie, is for the archaeologist an
uncharted chronological blank within which may be rooted the
beginnings of the later known historic phases o:f the Arkansas Caddo.
Lack of associated European trade-material is therefore no criterion of the prehistory of an Arkansas Caddo relic.
At an unknown time after DeSoto~s passage through the MidOuaehita region, the (:ahinnio tribe emerged as the most eastern
ally and probable member9 of the Kadohadacho

(Real Caddo),

leading tribe~O of the Caddo Confederacy who centered upon the
upper Red River. Hist(~rical data is very meager on this independent frontier tribe of Kadohadacho affiliation. The frontal headdeformingl 1 Tulas fought by DeSoto in the region of Caddo Gap
and identified by him as Caddo, seem to have lost their identity
before the historical horizon of the Cahinnio.

The Tula’s oblitera-

tion as a tribe, or possible absorption12 into Cahinnig identity
remains to be determined from future mass data of regiona! archaeological surveys.

In 1687, however, M. Cavelier and Joutel8 on their

return journey from the assassination of LaSalle, left the town of
the Kadahadacho in the company of two Cahinnio Indians who were
there ~eking osageorange bows.
Led by these friendly Cahinnios, the French party visited Cahaynohoua, the Cahinnio village
on the Ouachita River apparently in the vicinity of the present
Arkadelphia.7a Here they saw a Spanish sword, hawkbells and two
horses in Cahinnio possession. They also witnessed the ceremonial
dance of the calumet for the first time. The Red River Caddo used
pipes but had no such ceremony; yet the French party were again

100

Texas ArcheoZog$cal and Paleontological Society

to be subjected to the calumet ritual among the Quapaw (Uzutuhi)
at the mouth of the Arkansas River.

The French also observed

that the village consisted of a hundred separate cabins.

Guided by

Cahinnios carrying bows and arrows and Tonica salt-cakes for barter with the Quapaws, M. Cavelier’s party continued their passage
over difficult hills and swamps to DeTonti’s Post on the lower
Arkansas River. Joutel chronicled the Cahinnio Chief’s name as
Hinma.KiapgrnicheI z~ (Big Knife). This name is definitely Caddol 5
and supports the Caddoan ethnology of the Iirmly established Cahinnio of 1687.
Documentary

historical

excerpts support evidence

of a

con-

tinuous Cahinniois existence. Sometime between 1690 and 1692,
Fray Francisco Casafias de Jesus Maria, a Spanish missionary, was
carried northward to a settlement believed by Espinosa to have
been called Cainio~7 and its people Canigua.

Casafias also enumer-

ated in his list of tribes of Hasinais and of the Caddo group, the
Caynigua18 (Cahinnio). In 1700, d’Iberville, founder of the French
colony at the mouth of the Mississippi River, received rep6rts of the
names of "tribes in the Red River region.

Among them was Caehay-

mons,19 which Swanton interprets as Cahinnio.

On De l’lsle’s2O

map of 1718, Cahinnio is located on the Ouachita River, on the
north side and parallel to the upper Cadodaquios villages above
the great bend of the upper Red River. By 176321 the Cahinnios,
decimated by the incursion of white men, had finally moved northwest on the upper Arkansas River near the Mentos, and there they
eventually became extinct.

In 1771,22 the Spanish governor at

New Orleans, Unzaga, through the negotiations of Anathanase De
M~zier~s, diplomat and Indian agent among the Naehitoches, sueceeded in making a peace compact among the Caddos and nations
of the north.

The Canniones22 are recorded for the last time

among the signators.

Thus ended the scant historical sequence o,c

the Cahinnio Caddo.

Archaeologically we presume to attempt to interpret certain types
of pottery in the mass of Mid-Ouachita data, heretofore casually
called late Caddo, as representing the Cahinnio pottery complex
of Caddo culture. To conform with the archaeological custom of
avoiding historic tribal names, we suggest that this complex be

known as the Mid-Ouachita focus.

The regional material under

consideration occurs within the Ouachita basin from above Hot
Springs to the mouth of Terre Noir Creek, traversing Garland, Hot
Spring, and Clark Counties in southwest Arkansas.
In recent years localz3 archaeological activity in this region
has removed about two thousand pottery specimens from burials.
Most of the burial pits were one to two and a half feet in depth.
The exhumations were single, contained extended skeletons, and
were ordinarily grouped on the periphery or near a village midden,
rarely a burial mound.

Certain .artifacts found in deeper strata

presented a difference of appearance and were tentatively labeled
old Caddo or early Caddo.
factory classifications.

We considered these terms very unsatis-

Although the archaeological materia! under discussion shows a
minor sprinkling of culture material from Marksville to the histo’ric horizon, a large portion appears to be late Caddoan.

Any

pre-Caddo phase is absolutely excluded in the evidence under considera~on.
The chief argument in favor of Cahinnio Caddo identification
with the predominant types of the late Caddo Mid-Ouachita ceramic
ware, is the incredible multiplicity of certain types and decorations within that region. Surely duplication of form and often
of decoration in great numbers is of sufficient archaeological
significance to indicate a close organization of the aboriginal posssessors. Commonness is a positive factor in an analysis of unification and hence a determinant. Also the cor:elation of a particular
ware to its proper co-existent historical neighbor assists in coinciding the archaeological entity with historical sequence.
The inserted tabulation indicates the count of outstanding ceramic
types as indicated by prlvate23 collections repr~enting findings
from sites in the area under study. The territory archaeologically
studied extends from Social Hill in Hot Spring County to the mouth
of the Terre Noir Creek into which drains the Little Missiour River.

delphia and three Arkadelphia collections cover the terrain in the
vicinity~ of Arkadelphia and south in Clark County.
TYPE I--FrC.endship Engraved
Within the Mid-Ouachita regional confines, the unequivo’cably
predominant pottery form is the cazuela with its deeply engraved
rim.

In instances these vessels have been found stacked in the

graves of the populous Caddo sites of the Middle Ouachita region.
That cazuelas are functional is shown by the remains of pieces of
animal bones found in the gravel-earth of some.
Among the cazuelas of the Friendship and Arkadelphia vicinity, a characteristic Mid-Ouachita variant emerges from the masses.
(See Plate 18, No. 1).

The rim decoration is typically engraved

with a motif featuring banded links combined with cross-hatched
fillets. The links are formed by segmenting a horizontal band
into equal adjacent rectangles by deeply scratched vertical lines.
The band of links is often a straight finished unit or may curve
to adapt itself into combination with the cross-hatched fillet. A
frequent negative motif of key2z~ figures and negative discs results
from the combined elements of the design. Sizes vary from 3 inch
miniatures to 12 inch diameter bowls~ The paste is fine, homogeneous, usually sand and clay. This highly polished, vertical
rimmed, round bottom, shallow bowl is red-brown to brown-black
in color. The rim frequently has a tiny marginal roll. The engravure is rarely white-paint filled, and cross-hatching is almost
exclusively produced by crossing slanting lines.
The proportion of this banded-link variant of the Red River
cazuela diminishes below Arkadelphia (Clar.k County), and progressively decreases as the center of Red River Caddo culture at
Fulton is approached. If the above described cazuela rim decoration centers in the neighborhood of the confluence of the Ouachita
and the Caddo rivers, this recession of the link-banded cazuela rim
decoration is logical.
*The Caddo River empties into the Ouachita about three miles
above Arkadelphia.

TYPE II--Military.Road Mear~=ler Incise.J
The next type is purely culinary, namely the collared jar.

These

are found in all sizes from an inch across-diameter toy to the giant
12 inches across-diameter containers of a five gallon capacity. This
pottery form is urn-shaped, rough ware, which has heavy incisions
on both the collars and bodies of the vessels. Most of these pots
retain the soot of cooking fi~es on their surfaces. They are of a
seemingly poor grade of ware. usually broken within the grave
and difficult to excavate in perfect condition. Their very friable
texture was probably found adaptable to temperature changes, and
therefore became the practical ware to withstand the uneven expansion and contraction contingent to cooking.
Tempering includes sand and grit, clay, shell and fiber. The late Caddo of
Mid-Ouachita area certainly were plentifully equipped with these
culinary objects. Shattered small bones have been found in this
type of pot. However remains of funerary offerings of animal
origin usually decompose completely in the clay and sand soil
of the river-bottoms where even skeletal human remains are often
entirely obliterated. This type of Caddo ceramic ware is so plentiful as to become monotonous.

The predominating pattern of the collared jars is the all-over
meander, a deeply incised decoration on the body and collar which
combines repeated vertical lunar punctates in curvilinear bands
with row~ of horizontally curvilinear parallel incised lines . (See
Plate 18, No. lI). Bands of multiple rows of upright lunar punctuates alternating with deeply incised meandering lines are repeated
compactly on the entire modified globular vessel body and the
broad, outcurving collar. This domestic type resembles in shape
the Fosterzs Trail-Incised vase of the Belcher Mound. The vessels
range in size from 3 inches diameter and 3 inches height to 12 inche~
diameter and 15 inches height and possess thick walls (in larger
vessels ~ inch thick), made doubly heavy at the circular flat base.

Some of these vessels are large and have capacity of about three
gallons.

Their color ranges from pale tan to a smoke-mottled

greyish light-brown.
TYPE III--Blakelytawn Engraved Bottle
The two described common types are found in their late Caddo
graves with Type III bottles.

The great number of bottles found

in Mid-Ouaehita burials is noteworthy.

The range of variation in

decoration appalls the classifying archaeologist.

Prevalent char-

acteristics of the Mid-Ouachita bottle are that it is highly polished,
black drab in color, globular in shape and is commonly engraved.
The engravure is often red paint filled.

Decorations include: the

simple broken-line, involved interlocking scrolls and cross-hatched
fillets, nested chevrons, concentric circles.
paratively scarce.

Plain bottles are com-

Eccentric forms add their personality to the

complex and include effigies, tripod, compound, the rare loop and
the equally rare cowled.

However, the characteristic bottles of the Mid-Ouachita valley
are the broken-line or geniculate-engraved. (See Plate 19, Panel
III). Three main variations are apparent. On the body of a highly
polished, black drab bottle, are engraved with equal spacing:
Xo

Geniculated line variants using vertically-2 groups of gerticulated (a) 3 parallel lines;
2 groups of geniculated (b) 3 parallel lines alternating with
2 groups of 3 straight parallel lines;
2 groups of geniculated 3 parallel lines alternating with
2 groups of 3 parallel lines kinked in middle;
4 groups of straight 3 parallel lines;
3 groups of 5 centrally kinked parallel lines.
Two bands of 6 parallel lines engraved diagonally across
body of bottle, ending at double spurred rings at base of neck.
Lines are broken in center by symmetrically curved linkedbands balancing away from main band on either side.

3.

Diagonally curved band of 5 parallel lines fringed at center

:108

Band of links and spurred ring at ba~ of neck.

This deco-

ration is present on a tripod bottle as well as a flat bottomed
one.

The paste of the geniculate-types described is fine and homogeneous. Necks are straight, plain, and often have a spurred ring
engraved at the base.

The bottles are flat bottomed.

TYPE IV--Watermelon.Island Seed-Jar
The seed-jars, both plain and engraved, appear localized to the
territory of the Middle 0uachita. (See Plate 19, Panel IV). These
unusual pottery vessels with their thumb-sized apertures, are found
most abundantly on Waterme!on26 Island near Social Hill and at
Friendship, Hot Spring County, Arkansas. In this vicinity their
occurrence with highly polished engraved Caddo ware is common.
In the light of contemporary excavations, the seed-jar thus far
stands out as a critical type of ceramic ware in the region under
discussion.
The banded link engraved cazuela, the broken-line engraved bottle, the all-over meander incised collared jar, and the outstandingly
unique seed-jar are frequently found together in the Mid-Ouaehita
graves.

Yet bowls and bottles, artistically executed, of the late or

known historic27 Keno’, Glendora and Natchitoches phase of Caddo
culture occur in burials with the former described pottery forms.
Many of the burials are unmistakedly late Caddo.

Moreover, their

contents indicate a specific historic phase of Caddo culture.

The

poltery shows peripheral and trade influences as well as local
variations in types and decorations.
Corroboration of historical

and

archaeological coincidence is

suggested by the following data:

1. The presence of prehistoric novaculite29 mines near Hot
Springs, Arkansas, for arrow making material bears out the evident
prowess of the Cahinnio in bow and arrow manufacture used in
their exchange with the 0tsote Quapaw. A unique site exists near
the Friendship Mound on the Ouachita River in which a half acre
is literally blanketed with flint chips and broken projectiles, suggestive of a workshop.

Identification of M~d-Ouachita Pottery as Cahinnio Caddo

2.

109

An insignificantly low, sandy burial mound near Gum Springs,

Clark County, yielded 200 pieces of engraved polished pottery, 80%
of historic Glendora and Natchitoches type. However both cazuelas
and incised collared jars were associated therewith. Burials were
single, extended, with funerary offerings about the head and arms,
skulls natural and no apparent sign of head deformation.
3.

Another Caddo site near Friendship Mound yielded nests of

collared jars.

A Keno bottle and two engraved small circular

platters were found with one burial.

Also a typical Caddo loop

pipe surmounted a stack of incised collared jars in another.

Skele-

tal remains were almost obliterated by decomposition.
The loop-pipe (See Plate 19, Panel V) appears to be the frequent
form of pottery pipe asso’eiated with the previously classified MidOuachita pottery types.

Eleven of the sixteen earthenware pipes

in our collection have the looped end, three of which have a deep
notch or rather decoration in the loop.

In literature, only C. B.

Moore records finding a related specimen at Kent, Arkansas.
tiquities of Ouachita Valley, Fig. 99).

(An-

The loop pottery pipe is of

hard texture, buff to red in color and precisely fashioned.

An ex-

tension of the stem, curved and neatly joined to the front margin
of the bowl, makes a graceful and practical handle for the wellbalanccd pipe which appears to be an exclusive product of the
Middle Ouachita aborigines.
Projectile ~oints, celts, beads, bone implements, and bone ornaments are lacking or very rarely found in the burial pits with the
heretofore described pottery complex.

Neither are copper nor are

polished stone artifacts found in the grave furnishings with lhese
ceramic types.

Approximately 200 burials, scattered and in groups in Hot
Spring County (in Ouachita River bottoms eight miles above Friendship), had mixtures of many types of Caddo ware in the extensive
exhumations. Yet an inclusive survey of the artifacts identical with
or similar to Caddo, presents many ceramic types of the BelcherZS
Mound including the engraved, incised and stamped ware.
Since the historic Cahinnio and Kadohadacho of the Red River
were Caddz provinces, their ceramic forms would be expected to

Texas Archeo!ogical and Paleontological Society

110

bear a striking similarity. Thus the typical Caddo3° pattern
remains the same: highly polished and engraved pottery, as well
as the rougher wares featuring incising, punctate, appliqu6 and
brushing. However changes become apparent as the area approaches
the Red River great bend. Spurred lines become more prevalent
and exaggerated in both cazuela and bottle engravure. Motifs
change slightly and are bordered near the top of bowl rims by
one, two or three horizontal lines. Bottle forms change to taller
body, more angular shoulder and shorter neck. Again, approaching the center of the Red River31 Caddo culture, collared jars
sometimes develop four peaks on the rim, the body decoration
often occupies only the upper two-thirds of body space, and herringbone linear incised decoration predominates. The seed-jar type
almost disappears. These changes begin to appear in pottery forms
below Arkadelphia in Clark County, the fringe of the contact belt
between the historically coeval tribes, the. Red River Kadohadacho
and the Cahinnio Caddo.
In conclusion, within the Mid-Ouachita basin:
1.

Four definite pottery types are well defined in this area;

2. These types occur in profusion in the approximate geographic
area occupied by the historic Cahinnio’;
3. The historic temporal lateness is borne out by corresponding
archaeological associations;
4. These four pottery types show relationship with the Red
River Caddo.
For these reasons we suggest the designation of the pipe and
four pottery types as Mid-Ouachita focus. We further believe
this can be identified historically to represent the pottery complex of
the Cahinnio Caddo.

History and archaeology apparently correlate in the Mid-Ouachita
Valley and suggest the identification of the region’s historic aborigines as Cahinnio’, the firmly established tribe of the northeastern
outpost of the Caddo Confederacy.

STREAM BANK SILTS OF THE ABILENE
REGION
Bx" C~’r~us N. RAY
Early in the fall of 1927 the writer began a systematic search of
the vertical eared off banks of all of the streams of the Abilene
region for evidences of ancient man’s occupation and has continued
this research as a scientific hobby throughout the intervening eighteen
years. Prior to that time no archeologieal research had been done
in the immediate vicinity of Abilene, and with the exception of
Harold Cook’s excavation of bison bones and flints at Colorado,
Texas, situated seventy-five miles west of Abilene, none had been
done previously in a region several hundred miles in diameter.
The early reports were published on these sites in 1929 and 1930.
(1), (2), (a), (4), (5), (6), (7).
Various persons have assisted the writer during brief periods in
small excavations in the sites, but with the exception of those done
by Mr. Joe Ben Wheat in 1940, on W. P. A. funds, for Texas Technological

College of Lubbock, no large excavations have been

made.
(8)
Mr. Wheat was called into the.Army a short time
after he finished this work and no report has yet been published
on a large part of it. In 1934 Mr. E. B. Sayles wrote a report on
some of the writer’s sites, which was printed by Gila Pueblo, Globe,
Arizona. This was done after spending most of the summer of 1934,
in Abilene. (9)
Mr. Sayles previously had lived in Abilene up
to the year 1931 and had then assisted the writer in some small
excavations in the sites. Also during the summer of 1934 Gila
Pueblo sent Dr. Ernst Antevs and Dr. M. M. Leighton to examine
the sites for a few days with Mr. E, B. Sayles. Then Dr. Leighton
later issued a report based on their brief period of inspection of
the sites. (10)
In the Leighton report were some er.roneous conclusions and inferences which could have been avoided had he
spent more. time in examining the geology of the sites, and then
in some first hand consultation about the fossil fauna and artifacts
which had previously been dug out of the various sites during a
long period of years. Then on very insufficient data, and no right
of priority t~ name the formations, Dr. Leighton applied the general
term "Elm Creek Silts" to the whole top twenty-four feet of the

118

Texas ArcheoIogical and Paleontological Society

local stream bank silts. These are the silts situated above the dark
red deposit at the Gibson Site, which site the writer found in
January, 1930, and has studied ever since. The dark red deposits
beneath the so-called Elm Creek Silts at the Gibson She Mr. Leighton
then termed the "Durst Silts" after the name of an old real estate
survey of the Abilene Region. The writer had collected, and had
published reports in the Society’s Bulletins on, Abitene Points and
other flint artifact types which he had dug out of the dark red
deepest layer of silt at the Gibson site at intervals since 1930. It
then would naturally be expected that he would reserve ~he right
to name his own discoveries. At no time has excavation of any
consequence been done in the upper or so-called Elm Creek Silts
on Elm Creek, and there seem to be relatively few hearths and
artifacts at those levels situated in the banks of Elm Creek.
All of the early discoveries of midden levels in the upper series
of stream bank silts in the Abilene region were made by the writer
on the banks of the Clear Fork of the Brazos River in 1929 and
1930, and the early excavations in them were made near Nugent,
Texas, in the fall of 1929. In these excavations, made on the Will
Myatt place, the writer was assisted in excavation by Dr. Otto’ O.
Watts and E. B. Sayles.
The upper section of river bank silts varies in total thickness in
different sites from twenty to twenty-five feet and varies in color
and texture as one goes up or down its five distinct zones of deposition. To lump the whole upper silt section which required many
thousands of years to form simply as "Elm Creek Silts" seems to’
be very indefinite terminology. To locate a hmnan skeleton or an
artifact by use of such indefinite terminology one would be compelled to resort to measurements down from the present soil surface
to any object described, and much previous experience in doing so

has taught the writer that such a method is likely to be very inaccurate.

While it is true that there was a rather uniform deposition

of silts along all of the streams of the region, and that the different
zoned deposits hold their relative positions everywhere, the counteracting geological forces which aggrade and those which degrade
sedimentary deposits have in different sections of the same stream
operated to produce some differences in the relative thickness of
the same aged deposits in different sites. While in one site a silt
layer might be relatively thin, and the next one below it thick, in
another site the reverse might be true. Despite all of these conditions which are likely to trap the unwary there yet remains over
the whole region a general uniformity of color and texture and
relative placement, in each of the zones of silts, which enables an
experienced observer to outline them. In a few sites there are
older remnants of solidified Pleistocene gravels which remained in
place during a period of the late Pleistocene when most of the stream
beds of the region were scoured out down to Permian bed rock.
At a time near to the close of the Pleistocene the low lands along
the banks of the streams began to aggrade or fill up with stream
deposited silts and as these gradually built up apparently certain
levels remained stationary, or nearly so, during long enough time for
men to move onto them and live through periods sufficient to create
layers of ashes, burnt rocks, mussel shells, bones, and flints and
also’ to somewhat darken the old soil surfaces. These old darker
soil levels mark the upper surfaces of the different layers of silts at
the places where the changes took place into silts different in color
and in texture from those below. Hearths usually are more numerous
in the darker areas at the tops of silt layers.
It would seem ~at each time during the stationary period while
the upper surface of a silt stratum was being lived on that something happened to the region’s climate, its wind movements, its rainfall, or scarcity of it, sufficient to change the texture and color of
the next zone of silt deposited above it, so that the difference can
be seen from across the stream. There usually is some darkening
of the upper surface of each silt stratum, but this is very marked
on the top surface of the second one beneath the present soil surface.
To get the real evaluation of the color changes of the different
silts it is necessary to view a bank from across the stream, standing

124

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

on the bank opposite, for in a close up view the line of demarcation
often is not apparent.
In most sites the older Hawley gravels have been removed down
to bed rock, and since then seven different layers of silts have been
deposited to a total depth of between thirty and thirty-five feet above
bed rock.

These seven silts will herewith be named and described

from the bottom or first formed, upward to the present soil surface
the stream bank. On the present soil surface above these buried
sites are stone age hearths, which contain no indications of contact
with white men. In Plate 20 we see a composite or idealized drawing
showing the placement of the seven silts if all were intact in the
same site.
The Lower Clear Fork Silt

This is a dark red colored, dense clayey silt which contains some
gravel and caliche nodules of. medium size. In most places along
the larger streams of the region this silt has been either entirely
eroded away or is represented by a thin remnant located donna on the
bed rock. At the Gibson Site on Elm Creek however there is a
stratum of Lower Clear Fork Silt six feet thick, (See Plate (21),
lowest stratum). In this stratum are several zones of hearths which
contain quantities of charcoal, burnt rocks, ashes, thin man made
flint flakes, and artifacts. Down near the water line at about thirty
feet below the soil surface of the stream bank a very crude flint
dart head which the writer designated as a Jones Point was found
in 1939 while Dr. Clifford Jones, former president of Texas Technological College, and Dr. W. C. Holden of the same institution
were present. Crudely percussion made, thick leaf shaped Abilene
Points, were found in this dark red silt in the 24 1-2 feet deep level
in 1930 and subsequently. (11).
In 1940 a Gibson Point, which has a bevelled ’point and a base
somewhat like a crudely made Folsom Point, was found embedded
at a depth beneath the soil surface of twenty-five feet in this silt. (12)
Near the top of this deposit and just under an eight inch thick layer

strata, and the artifacts founds in them.

Plate 22

Stream Bank Silts of the Abitene Region

127

of gravel a Clear Fork Type (2) dart head was found embedded.
Nine hundred and sixty-seven feet up the creek bank in similar formation a proboscidian leg bone was found embedded in 1938. (13),
(14) Als6 a mano stone was found embedded in Lower Clear
Fork Silt at theGibson Site in 1940. (15), (16)
At the Hodges Site on the Brazos River near Nugent, Texas, this
silt has been removed by erosion, and the series begins on top of a
layer of gravel, which probably is the basal gravel layer of the next
silt stratum above or Upper Clear Fork Silt. There is a hearth
there on top of the gravel, and in this hearth the writer found a
Clear Fork Gouge embedded.
level of the Brazos.

This hearth lies very near low water

Several different types of flint cultures were used during the
forming of Lower Clear Fork Silt; and the time period of its deposition was a long one. The best preserved beds of this deposit
occur in the bottoms of dry mountain valleys west and south o~
Abilene, where the deposit is often ~from four to six feet in thickness. The men of the Clear Fork culture began using those types
of implements toward the close of deposition of Lower Clear Fork
Silt and used them throughout i.}le period of deposition of Upper
Clear Fork Silt, and this flint culture probably evolved out of the
Abilene Point type of the Lower Clear Fork Silt. The Lower Clear
Fork Silt is the silt termed Durst by M. M. Leighton. At two
different sites, the McLean and the Gibson, mammoths bones were
found in Lower Clear Fork Silt, in the McLean site with a Folsom
point, and at the Gibson site on a level with a mano, hearths and a
Jones Point.
The Upper Clear Fork Silt

This silt is red, but is not so dark, nor so dense in texture, as
Lower Clear Fork Silt and it has more sand and less gravel in it and
there are many small caliche nodules in Upper Clear Fork Silt.
At the Gibson site this silt is represented by an eight inch basal
layer of gravel and a thin layer of red silt adhering to its upper
surface (See Plate 2~). At the Hodges site this silt deposit is about
eight feet thick, and has a large hearth outcrop at its line of juncture
with the next silt above, Nugent Silt (]-). There is another row of
hearths at some distance below, and a third row of hearths do~m
near the bottom of the deposit. A mano and metate and a Clear

128

Texas Archeological and PaleontolOgical Society

Fork culture hand axe were found in the upper line of hearths.
There is some doubt in the writer’s mind as to whether the lowest
hearth shown in this drawing (see Plate 21) which lies in and on
a bed of gravel in a thin remnant of dark red silt is a remnant of an
otherwise eroded Lower Clear Fork Silt or is a hearth in the basal
gravel deposit of the stratum of Upper Clear Fork Silt which lies
above it.
A Clear Fork culture gouge was found embedded in the hearth,
but men began to use that culture before the close of the deposition
of the Lower Clear Fork Silt. In 1938 while accompanied by Dr.
Kirk Bryan and Samuel Vaughan the writer found a crude knife
embedded near the bottom of the Upper Clear Fork Silt ~t~a~um at
the Hodges site. This somewhat resembled the Abilene blades found
in the Lower Clear Fork Silt at the Gibson site.
Nugent Silt (1)
At the Hodges Site on the Brazos River, Nugent Silt (1) contains.
hearths at two levels, one at the line of juncture with the next silt
above and another ~ries at about its middle. Other thaa burnt rocks
and man made flint flakes no artifacts were found in the hearths.
At the Hodges Site this stratum is about 5 1-2 feet thick and at the
Gibson Site about 4 1-2 feet thick. The Nugent Silt (1) is pink
colored clayey silt of lighter color than the Upper Clear Fork Slit.
There are no discernable hearths in Nugent Silt (i) at the Gibson
site, but it is difficult to examine closely on account of the almost
vertical bank.
Nttgent Silt (2)

This silt is of a reddish brown color and clayey in texture, and
the thickness of Nugent Silt (2) is 8 feet in the Gibson Site and
2 1-2 feet in the Hodgcs Site. There are no discernable hearths
in this silt stratum either at the Gibson or Hodges sites. The deepest
buried human skeleton yet found in the re, on was excavated from
the top level of Nugent Silt (2) on the Putnara Ranch at depth of
21 feet below the present soil surface. (17)

Nugent Sih (3)
This silt is a light pink colored clayey silt which has a thickness
of 3 feet at the Hodges Site and of 2 1-2 feet at the Gibson Site, and
at the latter site there are ~ve narrow bandings in which darker
zones alternate with lighter pinkish zones. There are no hearths
visible at either site.
Nugent Silt (4)
Nugent Silt (4) has a distinctive broad dark humus stained zone
at its top which is always darker than that in any other stratum.
This dark zone is darkest at the line of demarcation between it and
the bottom ~of Nugent Silt (5) and shades out downward into one
of the characteristic light pinkish tan shades of the upper Nugent
Silt series. Nugent Silt (4) probably has more hearths exposed in it
than any other silt of the region. Evidently this level either remained
stationary longer than any of the others, or it represents a, period
when there was a much more abundant rainfal! which produced more
vegetation and heavier staining of the old ground level. Hearths
are abundant along the old surface level and all through the black
stained zone. The two first Matthews Ranch burials found in 1929
were at between 6 1-2 feet and seven feet deep in Nugent Silt (4)
as also was the burial found in 1939 (18) at below nine feet deep
on the same Ranch and situated about two miles south of the others.
The latter burial was actually buried at 10 feet below~ the surface,
but the earth had been disturbed up to below 9 feet in depth. The
latter burial had been made from below the black zone, which at
that site was about two feet thick, and the burial was done evidently
before the zone was formed. The black zone above the buria! at
the Matthews Ranch was thickly studded with burnt hearth rocks,
mussel shells and flint flakes.
Nugent Silt (5)

This silt varies considerably in thickness in tile different sites,
and is a rather uniform light pinkish’ tan in color and in texture
is rather sandy. Nugent Silt (5) has a thickness of four feet at
the Gibson Site and five feet at the Hodges Site, but farther down
the Brazos on the Myatt, Matthews and Putnam ranches, and at
many other sites, the usual thickness of the silt varies between six
and eight feet. There are a few scattered hearths at various depths

132

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

in this silt and these are more commonly found at a depth of about
four feet below the surface. There also are many hearths embedded
in the top soil surface which contain flint scrapers, arro~g heads,
manos and metates and hammerstones, but there are no artifacts
showing any trade relations with white men.~
Lower Clear Fork Silt Pleistocene in Age
The writer has evidence from three sites in the form of remains
of mammoths that the Lower Clear Fork Silt was laid down at about
the close of the Pleistocene Period, and it perhaps is twenty-five
or thirty thousand years old. The Upper Clear Fork Silt ~nay be
Pleistocene in age, but no definite evidence of it has been found,
and it is probable that the silt was formed immediately after the
extinction of the Pleistocene fauna. In eighteen years of examina.
tion of the stream banks of the Abilene region the writer never has
seen any reliable evidence that the mammoth or any other Pleistocene animal’s bones have ever been found in the so-called Elm
Creek silts, or in more definite terminology, in any of the five
Nugent Silts. One occasionally sees in print the statement that tim
"Elm Creek Silts are Pleistocene in age" and evidently this idea
was derived from an erroneous evaluation of the age of the deposits
in a site which the writer found in 1928 and has studied ever since.
This is a site on the Brazos River a few miles east of the village
of Hawley, Texas, in Jones County, on the farm of Mr. R. G. Young.
In this site during past years many teeth, bones and several tusks
of mammoths, have been found.
In 1934 Gila Pueblo sent Dr. M. M. Leighton, Chief of the State
Geological Survey of Illinois, to Abitene to examine the deeply
buried sites of the Abilene region, and he and others examined
these sites without the writer’s preserice or knowledge o~ it until

PLATE 24
This picture of the Gibson Site and those of Plates 25 and 26 were
made to record the facts by an Abilene photographer in January,
1930, shortly after the writer found the Gibson site. The writer is
pointing at the hearth level just below the eight inch thick gravel
stratum. Below the gravel layer is the Lower Clear Fork Silt. The
gravel stratum is the base of, and is a narrow remnant of, the
Upper Clear Fork Silt, which in this site has been nearly all re-~
moved by ancient erosive forces; above the gravel are the five
Nugent Silts, This picture was previously published in the Volume
II, 1930, issue of this Bulletin.

afterward, and then did not ask him for any opinions he might have
had about his sites, nor about the results of his researches in them,
extending over a period of many years. In 1936 Dr. Leighton issued
a report on his visit of a few days to these sites, and apparently he
had not read any of the many previously published reports on them
in various national scientific publications, and in the annual Bulletins of The Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society from
the year~ 1929 and ]930 onward, or at any rate he failed to mention
them in his bibliography.
This report was entitled Geological .Aspects of the Findings of
Primitive Man, Near AMlene, Texas. Medallion Papers No. XXIV
Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona. On page ]5 of that report there is
shown Plate V which has two panels, and the top panel (a) is a
picture of the R. G. Young site and this shows the writer pointing
to the highest level of those from which he had excavated mammoth
bones. Here there evidently was a whole mammoth skeleton originally, as two tusks, two teeth, a (houlder blade, and a complete
leg bone were excavated. The formation even that high up on the
bank has the same color of light gray, spotted with rust colored
zones, which is found not in the latest Pleistocene deposits, but in
far older deposits. On a line just above the writer’s head in Plate V
(a) of Leighton’s Report may be seen a line of unconformity below
which the picture shows a wide band of humt~s stained earth. On the
page opposite to Plate V of Dr. Leighton’s Report we find a reader
under (a) as follows "Ehn Creek Silts along Clear Fork of Brazo’s
River at Station 12. Three mammoth teeth were found by Dr. Ray,
of Abilene, the discoverer of this site, at about where the man is
shown in the picture; also a bone of equus in the lower gravel,
which may correlate with tire Durst Silts."
In reference to the above statement, at least ten mammoths teeth
of several different sizes of mammoths, including some small ones,
and many bones of marmnoths have been found there. The bone
referred to as "equus" was later definitely identified as a bison
leg bone. In the lower panel of Plate V of Dr. Leighton’s Report,
Panel (b), is shown a site located about three miles lower down
the Brazos River beside the Delk country road, a short distance
north of tire bridge across Mulberry Creek and near its mouth.
Panel (b) carries the following title under it "Elm Creek and Durst
(?) Silts" and the reader on the opposite page (14) is as follows

136

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

"Elm Creek Silts along Clear Fork of Brazos River at Station 14,
near the base of these silts, at the top of what appears to be Durst
Silts, on the same level as the man is standing, were-found hearths,
charcoal, and flint chips. The bluff is approximately thirty feet
high."
This writer has seen no evidence that the site shown as Panel
(b) in Dr. Leighton’s report is anything more ancient than the
five Nugent Silts which contain a recent fauna, and it is doubtful that either of the Clear Fork Silts are to be found there. The
stream probably began to deposit this bank in Nugent Silt (1)
time, and as such it is all of recent deposition down to the waters
edge. The writer has examined the site many times and has found
some groups of naturally embedded water laid stones, but no hearths,
although the formation should contain them.
On page 27 of Dr. Leighton’s Report he stated as follows concerning "Station 13 on the Clear Fork of the Brazos River, These
silts differ strikingly from those at Station 12 in having no caliche
and also in being finer with sparse small pebbles; yet the prominent
humus band is at the same horizon." In this and other comment
on the heavy humus stained zones of local sites Dr. Leighton several
times compared the recent humus stained zone at the top of Nugent
Silt (4) in the regular deposited silts along the banks of Elm Creek
and the Brazos River, with the ancient Pleistocene deposits in the
Young Site, which also have a broad hmnas stained zone at the top
of the Pleistocene deposit. Th!s zone is less than four feet beneath
the present soil surface.

the Young Site deposits below the unconformity as undoubtedly
many thousands of years older than the lowest level of the Lower
Clear Fork Silt, or the "Durst" according to Dr. Leighton’s terminology.
The writer has prepared a sketch of the Young Site, or the one
shown in Dr. Leighton’s Station 12, panel (a) to illustrate his own
findings in that site.

(See Plate (23) of this article.

In describing the Young Site we will begin at the bottom of the
site at tow water level. Stratum (1) is of dark red color and of
undisturbed Permian age, and is full of large red claystones, and
is 2 1-2 feet in thickness.
Stratum (2) is composed of 5 Ieet of Pleistocene conglomerate
stone and this contains Pleistocene forms of mussels and gastropods
and many mammoths bones and teeth.
Stratum (3) is composed of 6 feet of old Pleistocene gray sandy
clay, and rust colored zones. In the rust colored zones are many
mammoths bones and teeth.

Stratum (4) is composed of 10 feet of pinkish tan colored, hard
and caliche filled deposit. There are streaks of light gray sand and
gravel in this layer also. The top portion of this stratum which extends up to withiu less than four feet of the present soil snrfacc is
stained black with hunms,
Stratum {5) Separated by a slightly lighter line is a narrow band
of very dark silt just above Stratum ,1., and then there is a complete
break with the silt almve; which has the light pinkish tan color of the
top or last deposited stream silt of the Abilene Region or Nugent
Silt (5).
Evidently the true explanation of this site is that at a time while
the Pleistocene fauna was still very abundant, all of the three strata
of Pleistocene deposits np to within less than four feet of the present
soil surface were laid down, and that their heavy infiltration with
caliche so hardened them that they remained as an earlier Pleistocene remnant long after the time when most other such deposits
were removed by stream erosion, and that this bank so remained
intact, and its upper portion as a top soil surface, until about the
close of Nugent Silt (4) time, when its top took on the dark humus
coloration of Nugent Silt (4). Then unconformably over this was
deposited the late~ formed silt of the Abilene region, Nugent Silt

(5), to a depth of 3 1-2 feet on up to the present soil surface. The
evidence would indicate that both the Upper and Lower Clear Fork
Silts and Nugent Silts 1, 2, 3 and 4, never had a chance to form
because of the persistence into recent time in this bank of over
twenty feet of ancient Pleistocene deposits, llSee Plate (23)). *See

NF.WJS NOTES AND t~DITORIALS
NO BULLETIN PRINTED IN 1944
There was no Bulletin of the Society printed in 1944, for the
very good reason that too few articles of any kind were received by
the Editor to enable the Society to publish a book during that calendar year.

By January, 19~15, enough material was on hand to make

a small book, and the Society intended to issue this during the spring
of 19~15. When the time allotted to do the Bulletin editing arrived,
all of the printing company’s printers, except one, were engaged in
War activities. There was a shortage of civilian workmen everywhere at that time. During the summer of 194.,5 enough additional
good material was ~nt in to insure the publication of a Bulletin
of a quality up to" the standards of the organization. The Society’s
finances never have been in better condition, and sufficient resources
are on hand for payment of the costs of larger books, if enough
good articles could be obtained. If an article details some essentially sound and constructive work, and has either good photographic records or. black ink drawings as illustrations, even though
it may be the work of an untrained writer, it can be made to fit
after some alterations of text are made. The Editor does not have
the time available, however, to rewrite indifferently written articles.
If any of the members know ’of unpublished articles which meet
the Society’s standards, the Editor would like to have the opportunity to read them. The Society pays no salaries to its officers,
nor does it pay for manuscripts other than alloting a few copies
to the writer of each article. Of most Bulletin issues, only three
hundred copies have been printed, and no year’s issue has exceeded four hundred copies. Permanent files of these books are
in the possession of most of the great museums and university
libraries of America, and those of some foreign countries. When
a member’s book has been read, and then provided he does not plan
to retain it, the copy shou.ld be donated to a reputable .scientific
library as the~ volumes come in the category of rare books, even
when newly printed.

The Bulletins are the main foundation literature records of the
original archeological research done in Texas and some adjoining

states during the past eighteen years, and as such should not be
carelessly destroyht.
This volume of the Bulletin will be sent to all of those who paid
dues in either 19.’~-~ or 1945, and only one dues payment of $3.00
will be collected for those two years, and this volume is numbered
the sixteenth in the series of annual bulletins.

The Society prefers

to print articles on original research, rather than compilations
of work already done, and to use original photo’graphs and drawings
wherever possible, but it has been found advisable to reprint two
pages of pictures in connection with Dr. Roberts article which were
used in the preliminary report of the site in 1943.

ORGANIZATION OF THE SHREVEPORT SOCIETY
FOR NATURE STUDY
The Shreveport Society for Nature Study was organized in May,
1945, with an initial membership of approximately fifty individuals.
A Board of Directors consisting of twelve members was elected to
conduct the affairs of the Society until the first annual meeting in
September, 1945, and was empowered to submit a constitution and
by-laws at this meeting. Temporary officers chosen by the Board
were as follows: Chairman, Dr. Clarence H. Webb; Vice-Chairman,
William C. Spooner; Secretary, W. Brainerd Wright, all of Shreveport, Louisiana.
This society has for its purposes the study of any field of natural
science, die establishment and maintenance of museum collections
and exhibits, and the furthering, by all educational means, of interest and knowledge concerning the natural sciences and resources
of the area. Membership in the society is open to al! interested
persons in the Tri-State area of North Louisiana, East Texas, and
South Arkansas. The organization, including its exhibits, library
and properties, will be hound in the Louisiana State Exhibit Building on the State Fair Grounds at Shreveport, Louisiana. Special
educational memberships will be established and it is planned to
foster a Junior Society to encourage interest and participation of
faculties and students of the various schools and colleges of the area.

Ten:as A~’cheologic#d a~d Paleontological Soc~e~1]

Several preliminary meetings were held, at the first of which a
distinguished guest, Dr. Kirk Bryan of Harvard University, encour.
aged the formation of the society. He spoke flatteringly of the
splendid work done by the Texas Archeological and PaleontoIogical
Society as an example of the effectiveness of a properly organized
group.
Two projects in natural science fields are now engaging the interests of the society. One of the charter members, Mr. Alfred
Glassell of Shreveport, who is also president of "Ducks Unlimited,"
is collecting a comprehensive group of waterfowl from the coastal
marshes. The archeological group, with the technical assistance of
Curator Brainerd Wright, is preparing a panoramic display of the
Indian cultures of Louisiana, arranging the artifacts, with explana.
tory notes and drawings, by culture periods from the earliest Folsom.
Yuma to the historic Caddo, Tunica and Chitimacha.
Any visitors to Shreveport who are interested in natural sciences
are invited to visit the State Exhibit Building and to contact Curator
Wright or the other officers of the society.

CONCERNING THE CONTRIBUTORS
There are eight main articles in this issue of the Bulletin and of
these the writers of only three are professionally engaged in either
archeological or anthropological work, the others derive their incomes from different professions and have only amateur status in
archeology, however, Mr. Carl Chelf was formerly connected with
the Texas Memorial Museum at Austin, Texas, and Mr. R. K. Harris
with the Halt of State, Dallas, Texas, but both are now otherwise
engaged.
Three physicians and s~urgeons of two different schools of medical
practice have written articles for this issue, covering interests in
geology, paleontology, anthropology, and archeology. C.H. Webb,
M. D., of Shreveport, Louisiana, and J. L. Hodges, M. D., and

News Notes and Editorials

Mrs. Hodges, of Bismarck, Arkansas, have written very scholarly
articles concerning the Caddoan remains of their respective states.
This is in accordance with the old Southern tradition that a physiclan’s education eminently fitted him to appreciate seientlfie and
scholarly hobbies.

It would be far better for the progress of the

world, and for the welfare of their patients if more of the moderr~
doctors cultivated an interest in hobbies connected with seiertce and
culture.

A physician’s education gives him at least a reading

knowledge of many different sciences, each of which opens gates
into a multitude of by-paths which can be followed.

One of the

most fascinating of all of these to a doctor is physical anthropology,
which simply expands his knowledge of modern human anatomy,
and attempts to explain why our bones are as they are, and how
they got that way.

Drs. Stewart and Shapiro who have reports in

this Bulletin are such anthropology experts.

Dr. Shapiro is con-

netted with the American Museum of Natural History,. in New
York, and Dr. Stewart with the Smithsonian Institution.

The ordi-

nary doctor who has to devote most of his time to his vocation perhaps may never get to be rated as an expert on prehistoric physical
anthropology, but he nevertheless can enjoy many thrilling moments
digging up ancient anan’s remains and then digging out the secrets of
the beetle browed skulls which he finds.
l)r. Ales Hrdlicka of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. Robert
Broom of South Africa, and Sir Arthur Keith were all first
trained as physicians and surgeons, and the latter two practiced.
Dr. Charles H. Mayo, St., was a member of this Society for
many years before his death, and often wrote letters to dae Society’s
officers commending the work.
In one of these letters he stated
d~at every mat~ would live longer and be happier if he had one, or
better, two hobbies, of a nature different from what he did to earn
his living.
Prof. Alex Krieger of Texas University has written a very much
needed article on exactness in terminology. There perhaps is no
professional or amateur group so careless and inexact in their terminology as archeologists, and the national journal contributors and
editors are as inexact in expression as the amateur, if not worse.

152

Texas Archeolog~cal and Paleontological Society

This Editor once had some comments to make on the subject in
The American Antiquity Quarterly.

*Writers in scientific publica-

tions should beware of the inaccurate socalled English terminology
of newspapers. It seems that many newspaper writers never consult a dictionary for exact word meanings, but flounder around
either in localisms or in a special jargon of their own; The purpose of writing is to be understood by the greatest number of readers,
and to the extent local slang phrases, or other such forms o[ uncommort speech are used, by that much one limits reader understanding to the areas where such provincialisms arc current. Scientific writing especially is likely to be read on ~vcral continents
where different English dialects are used. To be understood generally one should u~ terms defined in some dictionary of the English
language and primary definitions wherever possible (unless it is a
question of naming newly discovered objects). Preferably an Englishman should use English works of reference and an American
writer the standard dictionaries of his own country, and then one can
determine his probable meaning.

It might be in order to list here

some characteristically inaccurate terminology used by archeologists
in articles printed in our leading national journals. We there learn
that skeletons are "accompanied" by such inanimate objects as beads,
axes, and pottery, and also that John Smith "recovered" flint kniv~,
arrow heads, and scrapers, which perhaps were two thousand years
old. If John Smith is of Indian ancestry and "recovered" some of
his patrimony, then perhaps the term might be correct, but if he is
European in ancestry, it might be difficult to prove that his ancestors
lost the artifacts which he "recovered." Again the word "possible"
is no substitute where probable is intended, according to any available dictionary. Ignorance in high places is also no substitute for a
d,~ctionary. A French kiug’s ignorance coupled with high office,
served to create and to perpetuate on down into modern times, an
error in the form of the Roman numeral four on clock faces. Another

should have been
are adequate terms
immediately after-

ward all of the newspapers blossomed forth with a nauseous superfluity of "normalcy."
But newspaper and radio carelessness should have no part in
scientific writing. Fortunately primary definition dictionary English
has about the same meaning everywhere, regardless of which end
a word the accent is placed upon by the inhabitants of different regions. There is one American news magazine which picks unusual,
obscure, or obsolete words out of the dictionary and scatters them
lavishly through its pages for a time. There is no good reason why
these should be used in scientific writing when more generally used
words of the same meaning are available. Such words are as grass,
they spring up today and are gone tomorrow.
Another tendency in some archeological writing is to an overuse
of quotation marks on questionable words which the writer seeks
to use, but yet wishes to disavow responsibility for. If the word
or phrase is quoted from another this is alright, but if not, and
a paper is too thickly starred with unnecessary quotation marks, the
reader is given the idea that the writer’s attitude is too apologetic.
The paper of Mr. R. K. Harris is a short but interesting description
of some very unusual bone tools. In April, while in Dallas, Texas,
to address the Texas Geographic Society, the Editor inspected these
very large bone artifacts at the home of Mr. Hhrris, where he has
fitted up a very interesting private museum collection.
Mr. Carl Chelf is now a man of ~nature years, but many years
ago’ when the Editor first met him he was an enthusiastic boy collector of arrow heads, aged twelve. Mr. Chelf has continued his
valuable work since then. Much research still needs doing on questions concerning the atlatl, the spear, and the bow and arrow.
Mr. A. H. Witte is an amateur archeologist like many of
and has done some good work both in the field of prehistoric
archeology, and in the study of a fam6us historical site of his
region.--C. N. R.

ARCHEOLOGICAL
SOCIETY
Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
~ne Texas Archeo~ogical Society (TAS) offers a wide range of opportunities for
those interested in Texas heritage. The mission of the Society is to promote study,
preservation and awareness of Texas archeology. A recent strategic plan calls for the
Society to create training opportunities for students, enhance and expand programs,
increase and diversify membership, inform the community of their archeo~ogical heritage
and cultivate and preserve resources. The membership generally numbers around 1400.
The Society calendar begins in October with the Annua~ Meeting, an event that
has taken place since 1929. Archeologists, professional and avocational, get together to
share information in research sessions and to hear from nationally renowned luncheon and
banquet speakers. Friday is a popular evening for the public forum with high profile
speakers and artifact identification. Meetings will be held in Lubbock (08) and De~ Rio (09).
Each spring TAS offers session~ of the Texas Archeology Academy. Topics in
this series of workshops include Archeology 101 (including a field day), Ceramics: "~ne
Stories Pottery Tells, Lithics: Reading Stone Tools, Historic Archeology and Rock Art of
Texas. Each Academy features power point presentations, a manual and hands-on
activities to reinforce concepts presented. In 2009 sessions will be held in Georgetown,
Study Butte, and Lake Jackson. Surveys at the dose of sessions reveal that participants
greatly value the information imparted during the workshop and the camaraderie of fellow
students.
The summer brings a field school that offers an opportunity for folks to
contribute to research about Texas archeology. The principal investigator is supported
by staff and experienced volunteers. Usually around 300 people participate. Newcomers
appreciate an orientation session before joining crews in the field.

Survey and lab

sessions provide other venues for people who want to learn more about the archeological
process.

The field schoo~ in 2009 will be in the Panhandle near Perryton.

We offer

scholarships to college students and Native Americans. A youth program instructs around
60 students each year.
Publications of the Society include a journal, the Bulletin of the TAS, a quarteHy
newsletter and two web sites~

g is the organizational web site that relates

current programs and opportunities. The other web site is v~%~_e~asb

,a

venue that offers information in the form of multi-level exhibits.

TAS has been a

supporting partner of Texas Beyond History since its inceptionl
