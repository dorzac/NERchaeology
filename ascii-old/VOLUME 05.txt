Foreword
History
All authorities agree that, prior to a few years ago, Texas constituted a vast unknown archeological territory
whose borders touched known areas where interesting civilizations flourished on the south, east and west.
Archeological investigation of the Abilene region was started in 1927 as a week-end and after-office
hour hobby of the editor, and continued for several years in association with the first secretary of the
Society.
In October, 1928, the two called a meeting of a few interested business and professional men including
college and university professors for the purpose of forming a society to study findings and publish reports.
This meeting resulted in the organization of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society.
A year later (1929) the first volume of the Society’s Bulletin was issued in September. This has been
published annually since then.
Editorial Principles
The Society receives financial support from neither corporation, school, college, university nor private
individual except the $3.00 payment of annual dues by members and the sales of Bulletins to libraries of
universities and museums throughout America.
Only 300 copies are published each year and this necessarily limits books sent for review to a very few.
None of the officers of the Society receive, nor have ever received, any pay for their work in editing, nor
have contributors been paid for their manuscripts or photographs. The Society neither has solicited nor accepted
advertising from anyone. The Society has maintained, and hopes to continue the publication above commercialism
of any kind on the high plane of pure scientific research.
Our publication is independent and is open to any scientist, either great or small who has really found
something and is reliable and accurate in his descriptions. We have no pet dogma, theory or thesis which
we hope to maintain against all comers. We feel free to present any aspect of a subject.
Objects of the Society
The Society was organized and chartered in pursuit of a literary and scientific undertaking; for the study of
the history, prehistory and the major and minor artifacts of man and the fossils representing the past floras and
faunas of Texas; for the encouragement of the proper collection and preservation of such artifacts and fossils in
museums and their study and classification and the publication of the results of the researches incident thereto.

THE IMPORTANCE OF TEXAS AS AN ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD
BY DR. WARREN KING MOOREHEAD
PHOTOGRAPHS BY FLOYD V. STUDER
The writer is very glad to offer a few suggestions
concerning archeological work in the State of
Texas.
We are all aware that the Texas area has been
more or less neglected, archeologically speaking,
until Professor J. E. Pearce of the University of
Texas began his researches many years ago. It is
true that we have a creditable amount of
ethnological material concerning the Comanches,
Apaches and other tribes. Texas for the most part,
remains terra incognita as far as archeology is
concerned. Many years ago a school teacher, Mr.
T. L. Eyerly, head of the Academy at Canadian,
published two brief papers in the Academy Bulletin
of 1907. A small collection of specimens from the
ruins on Wolf Creek, tributary of the Canadian, and
located in Ochiltree County, Texas Panhandle,
induced the writer to visit the region and make
some preliminary observations. Following this we
made more careful study and Dr. J. Alden Mason
of the University of Pennsylvania Museum also
engaged in a brief examination. The results of the
two surveys conducted by the writer are set forth
in “Archeology of the Arkansas River Valley,”
published in 1931. Following these preliminary
researches more thorough and extended
examination of the region was undertaken by Mr.
Floyd V. Studer of Amarillo and Dr. W. C. Holden
of the Texas Archeological and Paleontological
Society. Since the Bulletin has published several
articles in which detailed exploration is set forth,
it is not necessary for the writer, in the brief space
allotted him, to do other than make a few general
observations.

in culture as one proceeds up the Canadian. The
writer came to this conclusion after three
inspections and careful reading of the field notes
made available by this Society and Mr. Studer. It is
further to be noted, and this is significant, that save
on the upper river fragments of Pueblo pottery are
not much in evidence. On the contrary the great
majority of fragments discovered are not to be
identified with Pueblo. Pueblo pottery seems to be
intrusive. It should be clearly understood by this
statement the writer means small quantities
(fragments) of standard Pueblo ceramic designs.
There is sufficient of this pottery in collections of
the Texas Archeological and Paleontological
Society and members, also in Mr. Studer ’s
collection, to enable some student of ceramic art
to prepare a small monograph. I would suggest this.
.What relation the pottery bears to prevailing forms
found throughout Kansas and Oklahoma the writer
does not know. It is rather crude and seems inferior
to the fine art of the mid-Mississippi region.
Taking as our standard the remains of the
Handley Ranch, Wolf Creek (Ochiltree County),
here we have, it would seem, the beginning of the
famous Pueblo Cliff-dweller culture. That is, as
pointed out in the Arkansas Valley volume, there
is a definite departure from house construction of
the Plains tribes. Large stone slabs are set vertically
not laid horizontally. The ruins might come under
the general term of “Slab-house People,” as applied
by our observers in the Utah-New Mexico fields.

Proceeding westward, or up river, one
encounters larger groups of ruins and there is a
distinct improvement in architecture. Finally, in the

Pueblo folk. They say that the Pueblo
culture worked eastward, gradually
disappearing or merging into that of the
Plains, all of which may be true, but the
writer does not accept that version for
this reason the dominant or prevailing
characteristic of the Pueblo is their
superior ceramic art. It has been very
carefully studied and classified by Dr.
Kidder, as everyone knows. It is
inconceivable that a primitive people
would lose a fixed and established art
upon migrating a scant 300 miles. The
finding of numbers of fragments of
pottery of unquestioned Pueblo origin
here and there in the Panhandle has been
explained by Mr. Studer, who has done
considerable excavating, as intrusive.
The writer is inclined to believe he is
correct.
Dr. F. W. Hodge has commented
upon migration of Pueblo Indians into
the Buffalo Country, that they located
in Meade County, Kansas, and there
remained for some time. The University
of Kansas, years ago, made an
inspection of this site. The writer has
visited the remains in Meade County
and also a similar but smaller group
some miles distant. After reading these
reports, one concludes that the ancient
Spanish record of the migration refers
to the Meade County site. It should be
noted that these remains are not quite
the same in character as those of the
Panhandle country. The Meade County
settlement was not of long duration, is
not prehistoric setting.

writer knows practically nothing, and
accepting Professor Pearce’s valuable
researches with reference to central and presumptious, one may suggest that a well equipped

of the most intriguing archeological problems in several seasons. It is quite probable that such work

Their differences, or affinities, have been
rather positively assigned in the New
Mexican field. Until the Panhandle region
shall have been carefully examined, we
can not speak with assurance as to
presence of these various cultures or sub
divisions of them.
Another important phase of northwest
Texas archaeology is the number and
extent of flint quarries and deposits of
materials suitable for the manufacture of
implements. There has been discussion
with reference to the origin of the Folsom,
New Mexico, points. The stone from
which they are made is not uncommon
along the Canadian. Mr. Studer
discovered a number of these quarry or
chipping sites. It is recommended that
they all be recorded upon large scale
maps, further that specimens be selected
from each site and these should include
not merely finished and unfinished
artifacts but also some of the raw
material.

The question of caverns or rock
shelters arises. Already there has been
considerable research in this direction
farther west, although the results have not
been published. One might suggest that
there should be careful inspection of
natural rock shelters or caverns,
particularly those facing south, southwest
or east. In certain canyons and along “rim
rock” outcrops there are many livable
places formed by nature in which
primitive man might have resided for a
greater or less length of time.

The writer’s observations, for the most
part, have dealt with artifacts and their
distribution. He considers this a very
important subject. After five years study
and investigation of stone cutting tools
of North America, and tabulation of about 50,000
such objects, in museums and large collections
between northeast Canada and the Mexican

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

frontier, he has come to the conclusion
that tribes of prehistoric times may be
identified by such means. Artifacts must
be handled in very large groups. All our
present classifications have been based
upon linguistics. Obviously we do not
know the language of a prehistoric tribe
and must therefore depend upon
archeological research.
Before long the writer hopes to visit
Texas, confining his observation to a
study and classification of artifacts and
their distribution rather than exploration.
This should be left to local institutions
and trained individuals. It was the
consensus of opinion manifest during
the meeting held at Birmingham,
Alabama, last December that the states
or local institutions should be
encouraged to carry on their own
archaeological work. One may be
pardoned if he mentioned that the
gentlemen present represented fifteen
states and with the exception of New
York, Massachusetts, Michigan and
Illinois, these were of the South. It is
believed that they will carry on the work.
In conclusion the writer thanks
President Ray for affording him
opportunity to express appreciation of
the extent and importance of the Texas
field for pure research.

in both geologic and archaeologic

MULTIPLE BURIALS IN STONE CIST
MOUNDS OF THE ABILENE REGION
BY DR. CYRUS N. RAY
Roberts Covered Mound, 1
A type of stone slab cist containing a single longheaded, flexed burial, or at most two of such, has
been described by the writer in all of the four
preceding volumes of the Society’s Bulletin.
However, not until late in September of 1932 had
any local investigator found multiple cist burials in
this region. There is indeed a tale extant to the effect
that long ago some strangers (probably treasure
hunters) excavated seven skulls on the summit of a
high hill overlooking Elm Creek about eight miles
north of the site the writer will describe.

on its left side with its skull also facing the east. It
is evident that both were buried at the same time
and that the body of the one with its skull to the
south rested on top of the body of the one with the
skull to the north. The same heavy rock covered the
bodies of both. The skulls of neither of the skeletons
had been under the stone but were left projecting at
the ends of it.

The north skull had not been crushed and was
gotten out almost whole with all of its upper and
lower teeth intact. It is one of five good skulls sent
in February of this year to Dr. E. A. Hooton of

small skeleton, presumably that of a woman, and
beside it the skeleton of a very young child. The
heads of both lay to the north and that of the infant
was facing east and the woman’s skull lay upright,
facing south. The flexed bodies of both were
covered with another large, roughly square, flat rock
laid nearly horizontally but higher near the heads,
which lay outside of the rock covering. These skulls
were crushed, but, evidently, were of the same longheaded type. Near or against the long bones where
they were doubled against the chest were five large
mussel shells. The shells had not been altered in
any manner. Just below the head and about the region

of the left shoulder was a cache of objects which
must have been in a bag or container of some kind
as they were in a compact bundle. It is probable
that the handle of the sack or other container may
have been placed in the left hand as it lay beside
the left side of the face. In these flexed burials the
hand bones are nearly always found on either side
of the face. In the bundle were the proximal ends of
three deer horns of about three inches in length
which had been trimmed down from their intact
swollen bases to about the size of a large man’s
little finger. These objects had blunt distal ends and
probably were pressure flakers used in making flint
tools. Unfortunately these disappeared while
excavation was in progress. In addition
a bone awl, the articular ends of three
animal bones, one quartzite abrading
stone,* one thin patinated flint point
probably a drill point, and a crude
patinated side chipped scraper were
found.
The bone awl was identified by F.
B. Howard of the University of
Pennsylvania as “Part of the proximal
end of a metapodial of a deer or an
antelope”. The three other bones were
identified as the proximal ends of the
ulnae of deer or of antelope. In
reference to the above and other
identifications of bones sent to him and
mentioned below, Mr. Howard wrote:
“This may not be much help to you, but
let me add that it is not possible to tell
from fragments of leg bones whether the
animal is recent or earlier, that is,
Pleistocene. For a bone like the bison
bone (mentioned later) shows such little
difference if any between the recent and
extinct forms that it is impossible to tell
which it is.”

excavation was done by Mr. Hollis Roberts, Mr.
Mack Machen and the writer. An unusual feature
found in no other stone cist mound was encountered
in this mound. At a depth of about a foot parts of a
poorly preserved skull and a bundle of bone
fragments were found under the top layer of stones.
There was too little remaining of this skull to
determine its shape. Close by and at a depth of about
fifteen inches from the surface lay another skull and
bundle of bones. This skull was of medium size
and fairly well preserved and of a type never before
found in a stone slab grave. Its form was of the
modern type, short head with nearly vertical
forehead instead of the nearly flat bestial type
usually found. Resting in the center of its rib bones
lay a beautiful barbed, slender, sharp, blue,
unpatinated flint arrow-head.
Below the two shallow-buried skulls lay three
feet of tightly wedged slabs set on end and below
these and each under a separate horizontal slab and
each in its own cist lay five more skeletons at depths
of about four feet or more below the soil surface.
These five skulls and the three excavated by the
farmers had the typical low foreheads, long skulls,
curved femora and flat tibiae always found -in the

stone slab cist burials. No other artifacts were found
with any of the burials except a bone awl found
with one of the long heads at a depth of four feet.
Mr. E. B. Howard identified it as follows: “Part of
distal end of metapodial of deer or antelope.” A
hard, heavy animal bone found by the farmers with
the deeply buried skeletons was identified by Mr.
Howard as the “coossified cuboid-navicular bone
of bison.” He could not determine the species.
Considering the shape of the round-headed skull,
the unpatinated condition of the flint arrow head
found with it and its top stratum level type, and the
shallowness of the burial, it is the writer’s opinion
that some fairly recent Indian tribe raised up some
of the stones near the surface of this old mound and
thrust two later bundle burials into the mound’s top
and probably never knew that several feet deeper
lay the remains of an older type of man. The same
place would have been more likely to have been
used again as the burial site contains the only rocks
on the summit of a hill otherwise composed of loose,
sandy loam soil and it is evident that all of the slabs
had been carried to the top of the hill to line the
cists.

Another peculiarity of this mound not previously
encountered was that five of the ten skeletons
showed absolutely no trace of a single tooth or
fragment of the lower jaws. All of these skulls but
three had been badly- crushed by the four feet of
stone and soil above them, but practically all of the
skull-bone fragments and those of the rest of the
skeletons, including all of the upper jaws and teeth,
were found.

horizontally laid slab which was setting on top of
the ends of some three feet long slabs which were
set endwise in box form. Directly below the slab
was a long-headed skull facing west. It was in
excellent condition except that the lower jaw was
missing and no trace of any part of it was found.
Almost all of the rest of the skeleton was in place
in good condition and the bones were all still
arranged in sitting position facing west with the
knees drawn up on the chest and flexed and the
arms flexed so that the hands rested on each side of
the skull. The foot bones in the bottom of the boxlike compartment were a little more than four feet
below the soil surface. The bones have the same
peculiarities noted in other stone slab skeletons.

fragments in the soil near the top of the box and a

burial has since been excavated at a site thirty miles
west of Abilene in Nolan County. This contains no
features not previous described. It was found in the
top of a small, flat-topped, natural mound around
which was the scattered debris of a small camp
site. The site is beside a small creek branch which
is usually dry. On the eroded gravel margin of the
hillside close by and above the site was found part
of a Texas coast conch shell around which a groove
had been cut for the purpose of suspension. It is
hard and heavy, and probably partially mineralized.
The covered stone slab Gist burial mounds offer
many problems to the archeologist. Probably the
term mound is a misnomer in the sense of anything
of much consequence showing on the present soil
surface. However, it is the writer’s opinion that in
the long time ago when these structures were built
that they then were small mounds which accretion
later covered completely with soil for some
undetermined period. Now, only a few inches of

usually flat surfaces. But when one excavates these

other slab cists of the same type containing four
flexed long-headed burials with a bundle of deer
or antelope bone and horn artifacts of similar type
to those identified as Basket Maker elsewhere
would suggest to the writer some relation or
similarity to features of the Basket Maker culture
complex. It is certain that the vicinity of the main
sites shows many evidences of formerly occupied
ground levels buried under horizontal stratification
in river banks at depths of four, five, six and eight
feet below the present soil surfaces. At other places
not far away exist other camp site levels twentyfour and twenty-eight feet below the soil surfaces.
Sixty miles from these sites Mr. E. B. Sayles showed
the writer seven negative hand prints made by

Mr. Sayles called my attention to the typical squareshouldered, Basket-Maker man’s picture on the

Eight miles south of the principal burial site Mr.
Buckner Osborn showed me eight pictographs made
of red hematite paint on a similar ledge. Mr. Osborn
stated that another set of red pictographs existed
forty miles away from the principal burial sites in
an opposite direction from those shown to the writer
by Mr. Sayles. It is probable that we may here see
represented some of the first crude American
beginnings of stone-built structures which may have
evoluted into a generalized basket-maker prototype
or an early widespread basket-maker culture which
later constituted the foundation on which all of the
various phases of pueblo civilization rested?

in certain types of prehistoric camp sites throughout
the Abilene district and their presence occasioned
much speculation since only one bone artifact had
been found in the region previously and the shell
artifacts were so scantily represented and were
usually of such coastal materials as to lead one to
believe that they were manufactured elsewhere. As
a result of many years search of hundreds of camp
sites the writer’s collection contains only the
following in worked shell: three small beads, one
conch shell pendant, one mussel shell with a hole
drilled in the edge, and one abalone shell pendant.
In addition one sea shell tinkler and a large tubular
bead were found in one early burial and a worked
mussel shell in another. In worked bone, prior to
this series of excavations, only one object-a carved
petrified horse bone (species undetermined) had
been found. Nearly all of the objects enumerated
above owe their preservation to varying degrees
of mineralization and it may be true that the region

NOTES ON FIVE TEXAS CRANIA
BY DR. ERNEST A. HOOTON
Introductory Note

Sex and Age

The crania sent to the Peabody Museum by Dr.
Cyrus N. Ray had been carefully mended, but
suffered a good deal of secondary breakage in
shipment. A new and more complete restoration
of the specimens would have been possible at the
cost of a great deal of time and labor. The writer
had no time for this work of restoration, nor were
there available sufficiently skilled assistants to
carry out the work independently.

The cranium is of moderate weight and the
muscular attachments are medium in their
development. The sex criteria are well defined and
clearly show that the skull is that of a male. On the
basis of sutural occlusion and eruption and wear
of the teeth the individual at death was of middle
age (35-54 years).

In the following pages there are recorded the
principal measurements, indices, and
morphological observations made by the writer*.
These represent merely the routine data taken on
all crania. In the case of the morphological
observations, it should be explained that each
cranial feature is classified in one of five grades–
very small, small or submedium, medium, large,
very large. The standard of comparison is the
observer’s judgment as to average development in
the adult male Northwestern European skull.
Although the employment of such an ideal and
subjective standard is sure to yield varying results
in the case of different observers, it represents, at
any rate, the attempt to grade and to classify with
some precision features which are not measurable.

The measurements which could be taken, and
the indices derived from them are listed in the
accompanying table. The most notable feature of
the skull is its extremely narrow vault, the
maximum width of which is only 119 mm. Since
the length of the skull is considerable the cranial
index is one of the lowest ever observed by the
author in American Indians (60.71). There is no
suggestion of any pathological deformation, such
as scaphocephaly. The vault is symmetrically
formed. This cranium is also chamaecephalic and
acrocephalic. The facial indices approach the
leptoprosopic or narrow-faced condition. The nasal
index is moderate, but the palate is rather narrow
and long.

Metric and Indicial Features

Morphological Description
CRANIUM RM-1-S2
Condition
This cranium is extremely fragile and the bones
are very friable. The basilar region is fragmentary
and the right zygomatic arch is broken away. In
mending, the facial portion has been so attached
to the cranio-facial base as to increase the facial
length and prevent proper articulation of the
mandible. Although carefully mended, the
specimen has suffered badly in shipment. The
cranial capacity cannot be measured.

The skull is free from artificial or pathological
deformation. In the norma verticalis it is ellipsiod
in shape. The frontal region is rather primitive in
conformation. The brow ridges are large and
continuous across the orbits; the glabella is
prominent. The height and breadth of the frontal

Sex and Age
The sex criteria are poorly defined, but the
feebly developed muscular attachments, light
weight, small brow ridges and mastoids, and other
features indicate a female. The cranial vault sutures
are all open and the third molars are erupted but

The parietal region is narrow with a pronounced
sagittal elevation. The post-coronal depression is
slight; the bosses are medium; there are no parietal
foramina.
The temporal region is submedium in fullness.
The temporal and supra-mastoid crests are
moderately developed. The mastoid processes are
small and the sphenoid depressions slight.

The teeth are completely erupted, markedly
worn, and of fair quality. The lower left first molar
shows a secondary caries, consequent upon wear
and death of the tooth. There is here a moderate
alveolar abscess. Pyorrhea seems to have been
present. The bite is edge-to-edge.

Discussion
In order to work out to his satisfaction the racial
affinities of skulls, the physical anthropologist
really requires a substantial series-twenty or more.
The full range of a group variation cannot be
determined from the study of a very few specimens,
and the observer is likely to be mislead by purely
individual variations and by differences which are
due to chance. This difficulty probably accounts
to some extent for the seemingly great
heterogeneity of fossil man. It is quite apparent,
for example, from the new finds in Palestine and
in Java, that Neanderthal man was much more
varied in his physical characteristics than has been
generally assumed heretofore.

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

EXCAVATION OF SADDLE-BACK RUIN
BY DR. W. C. HOLDEN
At previous meetings of the Texas Archeological
and Paleontological Society I have read papers
dealing with the nature and problems of the
archaeology of the Canadian Valley of the
Panhandle of Texas. These papers have been
published in Volumes I, 11, III, and IV of the
Bulletin of the Society. In a paper read at the last
annual meeting I pointed out that Texas
Technological College had adopted a definite
program relative to attempting to establish the
identity of the Panhandle culture. The program
consisted, in brief, of excavating several typical
slab-stone ruins up the Canadian Valley for the
purpose of seeing how the Canadian culture “tied
in” with the known early Pueblo culture of the
Pecos drainage in New Mexico.

pointing towards the southeast. The mesa at its top
is 950 feet from the southeast to the northwest, and
it rises approximately 225 feet from the
surrounding country. Parker Creek rises several
miles to the southwest and flows a few hundred
feet west of the mesa into the Canadian. The creek
is dry most of the time, but water can be obtained
during drouthy periods by digging a few feet below
the level of its bed. A quarter of a mile southeast of
the mesa is a spring, no doubt the chief source of
water for the inhabitants of the ruin.

The “horn” of Saddle-Back mesa is a cap of
soft, yellowish-grey sandstone. The east, and south
sides of the horn are precipitous, the cliffs rising
some forty feet. On the other side the “horn” slopes
towards the northwest with a cone-like rotundity.

our tools and saw the ruins, several of them were
disappointed. They had expected something quite
different, particularly more visible evidence above
the ground. Nature sometimes has a way of
carefully concealing her secrets, and it was true in
this case for Saddle-Back ruin was so completely
covered that a casual observer would not have

remains of a human habitation.

A student engineer surveyed the site and laid off
seven trial trenches starting at the bottom of the
debris and converging to a point at the summit of
the incline. Each trench was four feet wide and laid
off in sections five feet long. After listening to a
lengthy lecture on the technique of excavation, two
students were assigned to each trial trench. We had
no money to hire labor and the students soon found
that archaeology meant work–manual work. The dirt
was taken out in six inch layers and
screened by hand before being hauled
down the hill in a wheel barrow. But
students forgot about the back-breakng
part of excavating in expectancy of what
the next spadefull will reveal. George
Langford was “first finder”. Within ten
minutes he had unearthed a beautiful flint
knife five inches long. In a few minutes
some one in Trench II uncovered a large
pot shard. Trench IV reported an arrow
head, and Trench I a flake of obsidian.
This was important for there are no
obsidian deposits in the Texas
Panhandle, and this piece had doubtless
been brought from a point two or three
hundred miles to the west in New
Mexico.

That afternoon Trench III uncovered
a pot shard distinctly different from the
typical Panhandle pottery. It was a
“black-on-white” and undoubtedly of
Pueblo origin. Here was something
which might “tie-up” with Pueblo
chronology. The next day a find in
Trench I completely upset our previous
theories about the date of the Panhandle
culture. The find consisted of a small
pot shard of glaze ware, suspiciously
like Rio Grande glaze. If this should
turn out to be a piece of Pueblo trade
ware, it would mean that our Panhandle
Indians were contemporary with a late
Pueblo period and that our ruins were a
thousand years younger than we first
believed.

Panhandle weather is variable even in June and
July. A part of the time the weather was ideal. A
few days were so hot, however, that some of the
students got their backs blistered through their
shirts. Two days the wind blew from the south
filling our eyes, ears, and noses with dust. Frequent
storms, mostly at night, threatened to carry our
camp away. One evening after supper we heard a
roaring to the west. Soon someone discovered the
cause. About a mile up the river a head-rise was
coming down. A wall of water several feet high
was churning, rolling, and foaming down stream.
At intervals of a half mile were other rises. In fifteen
minutes the Canadian was changed from a quiet
stream fifty feet wide to a heaving torrent a quarter
of a mile wide. The Panhandle Indians who
occupied our ruin centuries before had experienced
similar climatic changes and conditions, and we
were learning more what their lives must have been
like.

wide and nine feet long. It yielded some flint,
obsidian, pot shards, and an abundance of bone.
Four distinct floor levels were found. Near the
center of the room on the bottom level was a hearth
with a considerable amount of bone around it. Near
the north wall on the fourth level was found a piece
of roofing material of light red, puddled clay. In it
were indentation~ of twigs and small poles in the
roof.

After a few days we decided we could
accomplish more by getting up at 5:00 o’clock and
going immediately to work and having the cooks
bring breakfast to the diggings. This enabled us to
get a lot of digging done in the cool of early
morning.

Room 7 can hardly be called a room, as it
measured only three by three and one-half feet. The
walls were intact the north, east, and west ones
being one foot thick, and the south wall one and
one-half feet thick. Little material was found in it.

Room 2 had only one layer of debris. It
contained shards, flint, obsidian chips, and bone.
Rooms 3, 4, 5 and 6 contained no debris. The
fact that the cross walls between Rooms 13 and
14, 14 and 15, and 15, and 16, stopped abruptly
without closing, together with the fact the south
walls of Rooms 1 and 2 line with the south walls

excavating. The floor of this room had been leveled
with packed earth to offset the incline.

Rooms 12 and 13 appeared at first to be one
large room, but there was considerable evidence
that there had been a dividing wall between them.
Both rooms are irregular in shape and are
approximately ten by twelve feet. The south walls
of both rooms were unusually thick, averaging from
three to four feet. The north wall of Room 12 and
the north and east walls of Room 13 were very
heavy, but badly fallen. A definite floor level was
found in Room 13. On it was a great amount of
charcoal, but no hearth was found.

Room 19 was six feet long and varied in width
from two to four feet. The south wall was two and
a half feet wide and a foot and a half high. The
west and north walls varied from one foot to a foot
and a half in thickness and were one and a half feet
high. The east wall was two and one-half feet thick
and two feet high. The debris of this small room
was rich in artifacts. A hearth was located in the
east end. A definite floor level of red clay covered
with charcoal and ashes was found one foot below
the surface.

The walls of Room 15 were practically

well constructed, varying in height from two to three
feet. The floor was inclined to the southeast, being
a foot higher on that side.
Room 21, located almost at the center of the ruin,
has the shape of an L and may have been two rooms
at one time. There was a great mass of stones piled
promiscuously throughout the ruin, but as to whether
they were in a division wall, we were unable to
tell. The longest dimension of the room was twenty

feet with an average width of seven feet. The walls
were of irregular thickness and height varying in
thickness from two to four feet and in height from
one to two and a half feet high. A fire pit a foot
wide and several inches deep was found in the
southeast corner.
Room 22 was very small and triangular in shape
pointing towards the north. It measured six feet
north and south and four feet across the base. All
the walls were standing to a height of
one to two feet, and they varied in
thickness from one foot on the east side
to two feet on the west side. The floor
level, just above the sandstone, was
covered with charcoal and ashes.
Room 23, rectangular in shape, is
eleven feet long and five feet wide. All
of the walls were intact to a height of
two feet on the east to four feet on the
north to four feet on the south. The east
wall had a uniform thickness of two feet;
the north wall, four feet; and the west
and south walls, one foot.
Room 24, located on the east side of
the ruin, is also rectangular in shape,
measuring sixteen feet north and south
and four feet east and west. The east wall
was of good horizontal masonry about
two and a half feet thick. In height it
varied from two to three feet. The south
wall was three feet thick and two feet
high. The west and north walls were two
feet thick and about the same height. A
fireplace containing several inches of
ashes was in the south end.

Room 25 was perhaps the most
interesting room in the ruin. It is on the
north side of a sandstone cliff and
measures seven by ten feet. The debris
is nine feet thick at the cliff and four
and a half feet thick at the north wall.
The east wall of this room is an
interesting study of stratification. There
are four distinct floor levels. The first
level is on the sandstone. It contains two

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society
fire pits, one near the east wall twenty-four inches
in diameter and another on the west side eight
inches in diameter. On this floor level in the
southeast corner of the room was the skeleton of a
buffalo badly deteriorated. Other floor levels were
found at fifteen, thirty-six, and fifty-two inches
respectively from the bottom. On the north side is
a hearth four feet long and eighteen inches wide
built at the time the second floor level was being
used. It was made by placing a course of flat stones
on edge in such a way that the wall formed the
back side. This hearth was filled with ashes to a
depth of six inches.
Room 26 was nine feet east and west and five
feet north and south. The walls were intact and
varied from two to two and a half feet. They were
all built of heavy slab-stones set in adobe mortar.
The debris was eighteen inches deep on the north
side and six inches deep on the south side.
Room 27 measured approximately six by seven
feet. All of its walls were intact and made of slabstones. The north wall was one to two feet thick
and three feet high. The east wall was two feet thick
and three feet high. The south wall was one and a
half feet thick and four feet high, and the west wall
was two feet thick and two feet high.
Room 28 is sixteen feet east and west and seven
feet north and south. The four walls were standing,
the west one three to four feet thick and one foot
high, the north one two to three feet thick and one
foot high, the east one three feet thick and one foot
high, and the south one two feet thick and three
feet high. The room contained a definite floor level
and a fire pit seventeen inches in diameter and eight
inches deep in the northeast corner.

33

Room 31 was irregular in shape and measured
nine feet in one direction and twelve feet in the
other. Parts of the southeast and northwest walls
were destroyed by workers in excavation. The walls
corresponded in thickness and height to those of
the adjoining rooms. A definite floor level covered
with a thin layer of ashes was found two feet below
the surface.
Room 32, located in the northeast corner of the
ruin, was large. It measured ten feet north and south
and seventeen feet east and west. The walls, all
intact, averaged one and a half feet thick and two
feet high. The floor level was very distinct and was
made of several inches of hard packed earth
covered with a thin layer of red clay. There were
three holes in the floor which may have been cists
or fire pits.
Room 33 was of the rounded type, measuring
ten feet in one direction and fourteen feet in another
direction. The walls were approximately one foot
thick and two feet high. There was a hearth or fire
pit, fifteen inches in diameter and four inches deep
in the center of the room. In the southeast corner
was a bench or shelf made of stones. The shelf was
approximately one foot high and three feet long.
In the south wall of the room was a stone with four
grooves in it, probably caused by sharpening bone
objects in them. This room may have been a crude
kiva, but positive evidence is lacking.

Several of the rooms in this ruin are too small
to have been occupied. No doubt these were used
for storage purposes. The floors of some were
inclined so steeply that their use as rooms would
have been most uncomfortable. These likewise
were probably used for storage. No doors were
found in any of the rooms, and it is probable that

the two rock courses are placed two other rows of
slab-stones which are filled in between. In this way
the wall is built four or five courses high. The
average slab-stone outside wall is from three to
four feet thick at the bottom and “pyramids” into a
thickness of six inches at the top. The horizontal
masonry is usually crude with stones of irregular
size placed in thick adobe mortar. The east, outside
wall of Saddle-Back ruin, is of horizontal masonry
and is of good workmanship, showing that the
original Panhandle masons could do good work
on occasion. The stones are sized and evenly
placed. Often the inside partition walls are
composed of a first course of heavy slab-stone upon
which crude horizontal masonry is super-imposed.
In regard to the kind of roof that once covered
this ruin we have but one small piece of evidence;
however, it tells a great deal. In one of the rooms
was found a lump of hard, reddish adobe with the
indentions of twigs and small poles on one side. A
number of finger prints of the woman that puddled
the clay are clearly visible. This piece of roofing
material is similar to roofing material found more
abundantly in other Panhandle ruins. We infer,
therefore, that the ruin had a flat roof made by
placing brush on poles and then a layer of adobe
on top of the brush.
The flint-work of the Panhandle Indians was
superb. Their source of material was the Alibates
flint mine north of Amarillo. They made small,
exquisitely fashioned arrow points which contrast
vividly with the larger, cruder points of later Plains
Indians. The Panhandle Indians made many doublebeveled knives with four edges, shaped something
like an aeroplane propeller. These knives varied in
length from three to five inches. These people had
numerous hide scrapers of Alibates flint varying
in size and shape. The dominant type differs from
the snub-nose scraper of the Plains Indians in that
it is thin and finished with a fine process.
Artifacts of bone are plentiful, the most
dominant type being bone awls. These were made
mostly from the shin bones of antelope, the leg
bones of turkeys, and the rib bones of larger
animals. A considerable number of decorated bones
with grooves cut cross-wise have been found.

Several stag-horn pressure flakers with which they
fashioned their flint were excavated. They made
spades from buffalo femurs to use in the cultivation
of their own corn patches.
The Panhandle Indians used distinctly Plains
methods in their pottery construction. All their pots
were made of a grey material and carried textile
impressions. In some cases an orange color was
gotten as a result of the firing process. In rarer
instances a red color was obtained by the use of a
red wash. But whether grey, orange, or red, every
piece had fabric impressions. The pottery was
tempered with quartz and mica, and an analysis
shows it to be harder than Pueblo pottery.
In all 4901 shards were found in the ruin. Of
these 3034 were grey; 1215 were orange and red,
and 652 so blackened by fire that their original color
could not be ascertained. Put into percentages,
61.77% of the total were grey, 24.7% orange (and
red) and 15.67% black. It is to be remembered,
however, that the black shards were originally grey
or orange. A stratification study of the shards was
made by six inch layers, and it seems that the
proportion of grey and orange shards seems to hold
about the same throughout the debris.
Approximately two dozen shards of intrusive
shards from the Southwest were found. Of these
we will speak later.
The Panhandle Indians smoked pipes of both
soap stones and pottery construction. In both cases,
however, pipes were, no doubt, trade articles
procured at a considerable distance. These Indians
were fastidious about their ornaments. They must
have turquoise pendants, necklaces, and inlaid
turquoise objects from the Cerrillos mines south
of Santa Fe and certain kinds of shell beads from
the Pacific Coast. They also made use, however,
of objects of decorated bone, rattles made by
placing small, polished, black pebbles in terrapin
shells, and necklaces of bone beads.
The chief source of food was doubtless buffalo
meat. The vast amount of broken bones evenly
distributed through the dump heaps indicate that
the stone house inhabitants were great meat eaters.
In addition to buffalo, they had deer, antelope, bear,

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society
turkey, and small wild game. A rather important
secondary source of food was agriculture. On little
subirrigated areas along the creeks and the
Canadian River they raised corn which they ground
on metates and cooked over open fire places.
At the close of the season all of the materials
were taken to the Laboratory of Anthropology at
Santa Fe, where we studied them in consultation
with the Laboratory staff. Director Jesse Nusbaum
and Dr. H. P. Mera were extremely interested in
our problem, and exceedingly helpful to
us in dating our ruin and in identifying
pieces of trade ware. The most important
thing we did at the Laboratory was to
date the Panhandle culture. Among the
materials were about two dozen Glaze
1 and Biscuit A pot shards. They differed
so distinctly from the dominant type of
pottery that they are doubtless fragments
of trade ware. Glaze I and Biscuit A were
made only by the Pueblo Indians of the
Rio Grande drainage. By the tree-ring
science, it has been ascertained that
these wares were first made about 1350
A. D. Pottery is a fragile thing and
ordinarily does not last long when in use.
It is highly probable, therefore, that the
Panhandle Indians were contemporary
with the Glaze 1 period of Pueblo
history. In as much as the Panhandle
houses were in such a state of ruin by
1540 that the Spaniards passing through
the region at that time made no mention
of them, it is probable that the houses
had been deserted for a considerable
length of time. We may deduce,
therefore, that the sedentary Panhandle
culture flourished in Texas
approximately from 1350 to 1450 A. D.
This discovery was a great surprise to
most of us who have been working in
the Panhandle, and it completely upset
our previous theories.
Some of us had formerly thought that
the Canadian culture was an eastern
expansion of an early Pueblo people

35

shortly after the Christian era. The discovery,
however, that they are contemporary with a late
Pueblo period puts them in an entirely different
light. Their distinctive type of pottery indicates they
are non-Pueblo. It is highly probable that they were
a people of Plains or Eastern origin. Incidentally,
their pottery has a marked resemblance to the
prehistoric pottery of Tennessee and North
Carolina. They wandered into the Canadian Valley,
and found conditions there conducive to sedentary
life. The broken country and the fresh water creeks

of the Canadian Valley made the vicinity ideal for
buffalo at all seasons of the year. With a permanent
meat supply, the newcomers could settle down.
They either brought knowledge of corn culture with
them or borrowed it from the Pueblos to the west.
With corn to cultivate there was all the more reason
why they should stay in one place as they had to
constantly guard their corn fields from buffalo,
antelope, and deer from the time the corn was
planted until it was harvested.

The word “Pueblo” has a cultural significance, as
is evidenced by the fact that the Pueblos today are
descendants of four distinct linguistic groups. Two
adjacent Pueblo peoples may not be able to talk to
each other except through the common medium of
Spanish.

The question still remains as to what became of
the Panhandle Indians. After they evolved such a
civilization what caused them to completely
disappear? In time we may be able to answer that,

FLINT: ITS OCCURRENCE, COMPOSITION AND PATINA
BY HENRY E. ELROD
Flint is an amorphous, silicious substance,
occurring in the top of the upper series of the
“Chalk” in England, and in about the middle of
the Lower Cretaceous, in Texas. It dates from
Secondary Geologic times, and is thought to be a
product of the life cycle of certain silica-secreting
organisms, such as sponges, radiolarins, diatoms,
etc., some of which (the animal foraminifera) form
the “Chalk.” These foraminifera secrete silica in
the calcareous ooze on the sea floor, where it
gathers in nodular concretions and hardens, with
the chalk, into what we know as flint. Its
composition consists of almost pure silica, having
only traces of lime, iron and alumina. Many
limestones, also, contain similar silicious matter
which, when concentrated as in the chalk, becomesnot flint but chert.

where they can be seen occupying three distinct
belts in the white, chalky limestones.”
Referring further to these flints, Dr. Hill said
that, in so far as he knows, these are the only flint
horizons in the Cretaceous in the United States,
and that it was from these flints that the ancient
and modern Indians made their implements. He
said, also, that the ease of their lithologic
identification will be of value to the anthropologist
in tracing the extent of the intercourse and
depredations of former Indian tribes inhabiting this
region. In other regions of the United States, what
implements the Indians made of stone, were made
of other material than flint. In the Eastern portion,
chalcedony was rather generally used; in the central
northwest, agate; in the West, obsidian; in what is
now southern Arkansas and Oklahoma, and along
the western reaches of the Rio Grande, novaculite.
When true, flint implements are found outside of
the Texas limestone areas, it is practically certain
that flint of which the implement was made was
brought from Texas.

Occasionally, flint nodules are found with nuclei
of fossil shells, usually Requienia. Mr. Albert
Nowatny, of New Braunfels, Texas, has a flint
nodule the nucleus of which is a complete and
practically perfect crinoid head. A specimen of flint
recently found in the Frio Canyon has a nucleus of

SANDALS OF THE BIG BEND CULTURE WITH ADDITIONAL NOTES

warp sandals. The weft elements run at an angle
and are made from some unidentified soft material
which is thinner than the usual yucca leaf.
Fibre String Warp Sandal (I-d)
For this type, a single specimen, the warp
consists of opposing elements of single small twostrand string produced from desert fibres. The
shredded fibre woof was assembled in such a way
as to produce a soft cushion quite comfortable to
the foot but rather unsuited to the type of use
required in the rough country surrounding the cave
in which it was found. The size is such as to suggest
use by a woman and the sole shows little wear.
The cord ties range from 3-64” to 3-32” in diameter

distinguishing feature of this type lies in the type

practically the entire wearing surface of the sole

“Seven Warp” Yucca (II-b)

I have found this type of sandal only in the larger
of the adult sizes. It consists of six or seven warps
of medium width yucca leaves with the woof leaves
slightly smaller in size and neatly assembled so
that because of the regularity of weaving, a checker
effect is secured. This type of sandal lacks the
thickness and body weight of most of the sandals
previously described. They evidently depend upon
the compactness of the weave for wearing qualities

correct and illustrates the fact which
should be kept in mind with respect
to all reports from the Big Bend, that

time invalidate the materials of an

to a point a little beyond midway, attaching to the
warp and then passing over the foot. Heel ties are
found in a number of specimens but tying methods
are difficult to trace because of damage. They
should receive further study as well as more
accurate determination of the desert plants used. I
am inclined to think that we often say “yucca” when
it may be that several different yucca species such
as the Spanish dagger, bear grass, etc., may have
been used.

Because of the larger number of better preserved
specimens and the depth record above, it seems
reasonable to conclude that the more recent of the
cave dwellers used the fish-tail type of sandal. We
have not, however, included four specimens found

additions with respect to the materials previously

Museum, has located and definitely identified that
part of the atlatl equipment in Big Bend deposits as

strengthen the theory of relationship referred to. My
own excavation work during the past year has added
two rabbit stick fragments, proof of agriculture
(corn), a small but well shaped atlatl fragment
(cupped proximal end), and other evidence similar
to that included in my previous report. Individuals
interested in the atlatl foreshaft described in Volume
Four may turn to page 61 and insert a definite length
of 4 ½” for the atlatl part described on that page.
The proximal end mentioned above has the typical
shallow cup at the end into which the
spur of the throwing member would fit.
Other Big Bend evidence of similar
nature to those mentioned in the several
reports by Kifder and Guernsey are:
game balls; two and three-strand twisted
cord from 1/32” to ¼” in diameter; threestrand braided cord; bone awls;
pendants; use of sinew; a small “duck

Two more important parallels with
Basketmaker culture are worthy of
mention. One of these lies in the presence
of twined woven materials in both
matting and basketry. Two small baskets
are woven in this manner. One has some
attempt at ornament in that several rings
of dyed twisted string are woven into
the basket at intervals (P. 12, No. 23). A
second parallel culture trait lies in the
evidence pointing to the use of fur cloth
by the Big Bend Indian. Several sites
have yielded bits of string wound with
hide which suggest the remains of fur
cloth material. Two of the better
specimens indicate a strong resemblance
to the type of fur cloth made by twisting
heavier pieces of hide without the string
core. We have previously indicated a
lack of loom evidence in the Big Bend.
The fur cloth referred to is formed more

of course, was practiced among the Indians of
southern Arizona and elsewhere.

It should be said in conclusion, however, that
the Big Bend Culture continues to maintain distinct
characteristics of its own. This is evidenced
primarily in the sandal types, coiled basketry, (no
panniers), and burial customs. Dr. Cyrus N. Ray
has previously reported the finding of cremated
burials in the Abilene area. This practice was also
used in the Big Bend since we have evidence of
three burials with bones wrapped in twilled matting
mortuary bags, folded once and decorated (two
bags) with lines of black and red pigment. The
twilling runs diagonally with the bags and is
composed of from seven to nine elements to the
inch. One of the decorated bags contains the bones
of an infant (not cremated). The other two
command attention because of the fact that the
evident human remains have been cremated and
placed in the bag so as to form a neat and compact
bundle. The size of the mortuary bags range from
l0-1/2” to 16” wide and from 17” to 21” long before
folding. Sewing is done with small fiber cord.
Readers will recognize that this practice differs
radically from Basketmaker burial customs save
as to the decoration of bags with colors. Cremation,

As to the cephalic index of the Big Bend Indian,
Setzler reported a measurment of 70.3 for one of
his specimens. An average of eight skulls recently
measured in the Museum at Alpine indicated 70.7,
all long headed types. It is probable that the survey
now being conducted in Old Mexico by E. B. Sayles
will yield valuable contributions to the problems
of the Big Bend in Texas.

Sunshine, sand and lava, mesquite, creosote

The ranches lie very far apart on the
American side of the border, and on the
Mexican side to the south a waterless
desert makes travel almost impossible for
man or beast, still more impossible for the
needs of home and family.
But at one time this was not so. There
seem to have been many settlements in this
drainage country of Mt. Riley and the
Potrillo Mountains. Pottery sherds of many
different cultures, beads arrow points,
turquoise pendants, carved frogs, and
copper bells have been found here and in
sufficient quantities to prove that many
people must have lived and hunted on the
plains and nearby hills. The question of
the water supply must have been as acute
then as now. Today, the rancher scans the
sky and questions the gathering clouds the
answer means life or death to his valuable
white faced herd. Perhaps the same answer

or half buried in the sand, and no one knows how
many are completely covered from sight. From their
number, so many more than would be needed in so
small a village, and from the unworn condition of
the stones it would seem as if they were made here
perhaps for distribution to the many settlements in
the general vicinity. Can this possibly be a metate
factory? There is evidence in favor of such a
conclusion. On the hill north of the saddle of land
containing the metates there is a lava flow on the
top, that in falling over the side, cooled and split in
great blocks of a convenient size and shape, the
slope of the hill making an easy path for the heavy
blocks to travel from the source of supply to the
workers in the camp below, while a lake bed, now
long dry, may at that time have provided them with
water if needed in the grinding.
Right below the lava supply there are groups of
finished and unfinished stone artifacts, stone blocks
and fragments of broken stone. In a distance of one
hundred and seventy feet there are seven such
groups, and in each group from five to seven pieces
of worked stone. Scattered about are the evidences
of the workers in sherds and bead.

In the Sauer-Brand report “Pre-historic
Settlements of Sonora” University of California
Publication-1931, there is mention made on page
89 of a place called “Mesa de los Metates” on a
hill south of Nogales, Mexico. The report says, as
well as entire metates, there were found a great
number worn and broken by constant use, and all
must have been transported there from some earlier
habition. To the contrary on this hill of the metates
in New Mexico, the source of supply of the material,
the work shop, the finished product and the points
of distribution are all in convenient distance of each
other.
Mr. Donald D. Brand also brought from the
Chihuahua country two large lava blocks similar in
material, though slightly smaller, to the two found
here. This may indicate the same Mexican influences
as already shown by the Chihuahua pottery sherds
and the copper bells. But the peculiar grooving and
the same lava material would prove that the blocks
were made here, even if the pottery and bells came
from the south.

INDIAN PIPES OF EAST TEXAS
BY A. T. JACKSON
The aboriginal inhabitants of the timbered
region of East Texas made pipes of
earthenware and stone. The pipes are found
in burials and midden deposits in the ancient
village sites along the streams. While not
numerous, they are in sufficient numbers, and
distributed over such a wide area, as to
represent a cultural trait of the region.
The material in this article is gleaned from
my field notes covering three seasons’ work;
and from a careful study of 81 pipes in the
collection of the Anthropology Department of
the University of Texas. The three seasons—
1930 to 1932 inclusive—embraced
approximately 20 months of intensive field
work. Returns for 1933 are not included.
A large strip of East Texas, extending from
Sabine County to Jefferson County, has not
been explored by the University of Texas at
the time of this writing (March, 1933.) Hence
no data are available for that region.
Sixty per cent of the pipes were in graves,
where they were buried along with other
mortuary offerings. On an average, one grave
in ten contained a pipe. Thirty-five per cent
were imbedded in kitchen midden deposits.
The remaining five per cent came from the
surface of camp sites. Most of those
accompanying burials were whole. Many of
the pipes in midden deposits and on the
surface were broken.
Scarcity of Stone Pipes.
Only five stone pipes have been secured
from this region. Four came from along Red
River, in Lamar and Bowie counties; the other
from near Sulphur River, Morris County.
Twenty percent of the pipes from Red River
are of stone; six percent of those from Sulphur
River; and none from the Sabine and Neches

River areas. In this connection, it is interesting to
note that more polished stone celts are found in the
Sabine River area than elsewhere.
Pipes With Flat Bases
A flat bottom—that enables the pipe to remain
upright when laid on any surface—is a feature
appearing among some specimens from several
different types. The percentage of stems with flat
bottoms is greater among pipes of the conical-bowl
type than others. An average of one pipe in six has
either a flat-bottomed stem or flat bowl-base.
Occasionally the bottom of a stem is flat only a
portion of its length; another may be flat the entire
length. There are several variants of flat-bottomed
pipe bowls. One is in the form of a round bottom;
another has a semi-circular knob at the base of the
bowl.

Distribution by River Basins
Different types of pipes are present in the various
subculture areas. The same is true of earthenware
vessels in general. The subculture areas follow the
principal river valleys. The region is thus divided
into four areas: the Red, Sulphur, Sabine and
Neches river valleys.
The number of pipes from the respective areas
do not vary widely. The greatest difference is
between the Sulphur and Sabine River subcultures.
The distribution of pipes is a fairly accurate index
to the numbers of earthenware vessels secured from
these areas. The Sabine River Valley holds first
place in each case.
The following tabulation shows the types of
pipes and the numbers of each in the respective
areas. The type names are applied because of
certain distinctive features. The classification is
tentative and no doubt will be revised as additional
specimens are secured for study and comparison.

Thong-Hole Pipes.
Of particular interest are the pipes bearing small
holes that appear to have been for attaching strings.
In two cases the edges of the holes seem to show
some wear; but holes in the other specimens reveal
no evidence of use. All the thong-holes but one are
located at the bases of the bowls. The exception is
that of a stone pipe, with the thong-hole in a knob
on top of the stem at the outer end. The holes vary
in diameter from 1-16 to 3-16 inch.

In writing about a stone pipe from Sterling, Conn.,
McGuire2 says: “There is a hole bored through the
base of this specimen from side to side, evidently
intended to receive a string, which would be
attached to the stem. It appears to the writer that
pipes with holes for attaching bowl and stem, or
for whatever purpose the hole was intended, are

Separate Stems
Practically all the pipes, except a few
of the long-stemmed type, seem to have
been for use with separate stems. But
no auxiliary stems have been found in
place in any of the pipes. This would
seem to suggest that they were of wood,
reed or other perishable material.

decorated in some form. Forty-four of
them are incised, 10 have raised lines
or ridges, and two bear an excess amount
of shell tempering. Twenty-five are
undecorated. Of those incised, 10 are

A trench in the larger mound on the
A. C. Saunders farm revealed no
burials, no fragments of pipes and less
than a dozen pot-sherds and fragments
of animal bones. The mound was built
on a natural knoll about 2 feet high.
Just above that was a deposit, 3½ feet
deep at the center and gradually
decreasing in thickness toward the
edge, of hard-packed ashes. Above the
ash was a layer of some 18 inches of
sandy loam. The diameter of the mound
was 125 feet.
In describing the habits and customs
of the Asinais, or Tejas, Indians, Fray
Juan Agustin DeMorfi, in a report
written in 1778, states that they “offer
their adoration to fire. For this they
have a house or temple where they
perpetually keep a fire. In front of the
bed in the fire temple.” Father DeMorfi
continues, “there is located a little
square stool. On this stool it was
customary to have tobacco, pipe and
some feathers; little pots of clay, which
seemed to serve as incense burners,
where they burned tobacco and
grease.” “They exercise great care in
taking out of the temple the ashes of
the sacred fire which they keep to make
large mounds.”4

Eight earthenware and two stone pipes were

located on Bois d’ Arc Creek 1/2 mile from its

Lamar County. We worked at the site from July 23
to August 28, 1931 and uncovered 21 graves
containing 60 skeletons, many of which were in an
excellent state of preservation. In one burial was a
stone pipe with an unusually small bowl and a long
stem. It was only 8 inches below the surface and 7
inches above the right shoulder. The bowl was 1
inch high and 5-8 inch in diameter; the stem 3 1/4
inches long and 7/16 inch in diameter. On top of
the stem was carved an “X” or cross; and on the
edge of the bowl were 10 tiny notches. The pipe
was made from a fine grained sandstone and bears
a polish.
In another burial, at a depth of 27 inches, located
30 inches east (back) of the skull and with the stem
to the east, was an earthenware pipe. It was well
polished; no decoration. Other artifacts in the grave
included a large broken bottle; a gorget, carved from
conch shell in the form of an equal-armed cross
enclosed in a circle: a tiny arrowpoint; broken shell
pendant; and 668 shell beads around and over the
skull, around the wrist and legs and loose in the

other artifacts. Aboriginal barter or trade in pipes
was extensive.”
In discussing the probable age of Catlinite pipes,
the same writer says8 “They were found in great
numbers in modern graves, in village-sites where
tribes have lived in the historic period. This in itself
is significant.”
A shell-tempered earthenware pipe was also
found on the surface at the Womack site. Stem and
bowl are approximately the same size-a little less
than 1 inch. The end of the stem is somewhat
enlarged and there is a pointed projection at the
rear in line with the stem. Its general shape is
remarkably like a Catlinite pipe in the University
of Texas collection from a historic burial on John
Fleming farm, 10 miles southeast of Santa Anna,
Coleman County, Texas.
A low earth mound, in Red River bottom on E.
H. Moore’s plantation, 10 1/2 miles northwest of
Texarkana, Bowie County, was excavated August
12 to September 2, 1932. Five earthenware pipes
were recovered-at depths ranging from 11 to 35
inches from the midden deposit in the mound. They
were of the tubular, semi-tubular, triangular, massive
elbow and handle types. The tubular pipe was much
the same as one secured from a midden mound on
A. C. Saunders farm, Anderson County.

The semi-tubular specimen bears no close
resemblance to any others yet found by us in East
Texas. It carries a slight suggestion of the shape of
the hunting or powder horn. This may be a mere
coincidence; or intentional copying-since lead

On the surface of a campsite
at the Mitchell place, 9 miles
west of Texarkana, Bowie
County, was found a tubular
stone pipe, or so-called “cloudblower.” The specimen is 3 3/
4 inches long. It is made of a
fine sandstone. The only
decoration consists of three
incised lines encircling each
end. This is the only tubular
stone pipe so far found in
Northeast Texas, although two
of earthenware have been
unearthed. Tubular stone pipes
have been found in Central and
South Texas.

stone pipe is found in the
western part of the United
States and is the exclusive form
in the highland region from
British Columbia to the Rio
Grande; it is even occasionally
met with in the. Mississippi

Concerning the probable age
of tubular pipes, McGuire 12
says: “The use of the tubular
pipe in certain aboriginal
ceremonies at the most solemn
junctures would suggest its
greater antiquity over other
forms, especially when we find
great veneration paid to the
tube which is not given to other
types of pipe.”

SOME ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELDS NEAR THE CITY OF MEXICO
BY COL. M. L. CRIMMINS
(Illustrations furnished through the courtesy of Dr. George
C. Valliant of the American Museum of National History)

In order to study some of the sources of the
culture of our American Indians, we made a trip to
the City of Mexico last August. In telling the story
of the American Indian, Dr. Paul Radin of the
University of California says that our North
American Indians owed the fundamental and basic
traits of their civilization to the direct or indirect
influence of the Mayas. Our Indians undoubtedly
developed their agriculture, pyramidal mounds,
ceramic art, and other evidences of culture through
the influence of the Mayas. Radin believes the
Mayas or a people completely transformed by
Mayan culture, actually invaded the lower
Mississippi Valley and laid the foundation of the
Mound-Builders. The Mound-Builders in turn
doubtlessly influenced the culture of all the tribes
east of the Mississippi to a very great extent, and
some of their culture evidently spread to Eastern
Texas as shown by recent finds of the University
of Texas. The Mayan influence gradually
deteriorated as it spread northward. The

Zapotecans, with their high civilization, records
their first contact to the north; and then came the
Toltecs. From the Toltecs the pre-Aztecs and Aztecs
owe their culture. The effect of the northern spread
of Mayan influence to our Southwest was affected
by a whole series of invasions from Mexico starting
in the pre-Toltec time and continuing to the postToltec period. The Aztec tradition that they came
from the North may be true, but when they did, the
most active people were returning towards the place
their peregrination had started from, and those left
behind were the least affected. There seems to be a
gradual deterioration from the culture of the Mayas
to the simple tribes of northern Canada. The lack
of a concentrated food supply would have that
effect.
Archaeological knowledge cannot go back of
the material objects that have survived destruction.
We have, therefore, only the imperishable artifacts
such as pottery, clay figurines, engravings, gorgets,
and delicate flint knives to study. The similarity of
the above-mentioned artifacts of the MoundBuilders and those of the ancient Mexicans is so

striking that it can only be assumed that the MoundBuilders had contact with the Mexicans in
prehistoric times. Why was the contact broken?
Was the urge that prompted their peregrination
northward exhausted? We do not know, but we do
know that those left behind in the north belong to
the same race as those that started on the
peregrination from the south. The Mexican and
American Indian are of the same race.

deep beneath the debris of following civilizations.
Many have been found beneath lava that flowed
from volcanoes from three to seven thousand years
ago. It is believed that the female figurines were
placed in the fields as votive offerings or prayers
to increase the fertility of the crops. The little clay
heads may have been likenesses of some loved one
or popular hero as so many of them are similar in
design.

This wave of influence from Mexico was spent
before the discovery of the New World-but it left
in the cornfields of Ohio beautiful works of art,
whose intimate inspiration was Mayan. Therefore
no history of the North American Indian can any
longer be considered without recognizing the
background of Mexican influence.

The most cultured people at the dawn of
Mexican history were the Mayas. They probably
developed in the Mexican highlands, the wild
maize or teocentli; which concentrated food aided
them in becoming a nation. They probably had their
origin near Vera Cruz in Mexico and in the Uloa
Valley of Honduras, but at the height of their culture
the Mayas were settled in Yucatan. The culture of
the Mayas affected the culture of the people of the
valley of Mexico indirectly, for it was their
sculptures and other products that ranked with the
highest in the New World. What Greek art was to
Europe, Mayan culture was to prehistoric America.
The Mayans were deep students of astronomy, and
they had a better calendar than the Europeans at
the time of the discovery of Mexico. They based
their calendar on careful astronomical observations.
They built their cities of stone in a manner superior
to any in the new world. They appeared on the
threshold of American history, about twenty-five
hundred years ago and then established their great
cities of Tikal in northern Guatemala and Copan
in western Honduras. Their most brilliant period
was from three hundred to six hundred A. D. after
which their ancient cities were abandoned,
probably due to drought or pestilence or both. They
then moved into northern Yucatan where the second
period of their culture, lasting six hundred years,
began. During the first period of the Mayan empire,
what is now known as the Valley of Mexico, was
inhabited by the Nahua people about whom little
is known. There were many tribes of these people
of whom the following were the best known the
Olmecas, Totonacs, and the Zapotecs. Their
language, Nahuatl, meant “clear speech”. The
Olmecas derived their name from the Nahuatl-for
rubber-Olli, and they were known as the rubber
people and were the first civilized people of the

To tell our story by the means available we must
first understand the methods used. We do so by
the study of Archaeology. Archaeology in the sense
which I will use it is the study of the art,
architecture, customs, and beliefs of some of the
ancient people of Mexico as shown by their
monuments, implements, inscriptions, relies, etc.
Archaeology begins where man ceases to speak
and has to be spoken for. The earliest culture in
America probably started in the region near Vera
Cruz, Mexico, more than six thousand years ago.
This culture was called Archaic, and was about as
advanced as that of the Eskimo before being
influenced by white men. We have little evidence
of the Archaic culture outside of their ceramic
objects. The pottery of that period was heavy and
simple, and their decoration was in relief. When
paint was used, only the simplest geometric designs
were shown. They did some stone work, in fact
the stone figurine preceded the ceramic, and they
made stone implements, ornaments, and crude
figurines of men and animals. The most interesting
of these early attempts at art were the pottery human
figurines. They were quite distinctive, and the heads
were flattened in the gingerbread-design. Details
of the headdress and clothing were added as well
as the tattooing on their bodies. The sitting postures
of both men and women are shown by these
figurines. These clay figures are found throughout
Southern Mexico, in ancient mounds and burials

Highlands of Mexico. The Totonacs were from
Central Vera Cruz and were probably connected
with the Mayan tribes called Huastecas as they
absorbed some of their culture, while outside the
Valley of Mexico their culture strongly affected it.
Their artistic figurines with smiling faces are quite
characteristic, and are the finest examples of clay
moulding in the New World. Their heavy stone
yokes or collars, often beautifully carved, were said
to have been placed on the necks of their human
victims about to be sacrificed. They were of a
smooth, hard, greenish stone nephrite and were
usually polished, and weighed about twenty-five
pounds.
South of the City of Mexico in the Oaxaca
Valley we find the Zapotacos of the Middle
Civilization. They are supposed to have absorbed
the Mayan culture just as the Romans did that of
the Greeks. Their art, hieroglyphic writing and
calendar system show this. The recent finds at Mt.
Alban, with their beautiful gold and jade
ornaments, place them very high in the history of
Mexican primitive art. It is believed that Oaxaca
was their former capital, which was abandoned
before the arrival of the Spaniards in 1519. The

famous temples of Mitla are among the best
preserved in Mexico, and it was there that the
Zapotecan kings were buried. They were expert
potters, goldsmiths, and lapidaries.
About thirty-five miles northeast of Mexico City
lie the ruins of San Juan Teotihuacan. In the
magnitude of its remains and in the evidence the
site furnishes of population and antiquity it stands
easily at the head of the ancient cities of Mexico.
Were the entire mass of the ruined structures of
Chichen Itza, Uxmal, or Mitla, heaped in a single
mound, it would hardly surpass the great Pyramid
of the Sun, and the whole bulk of Teotihuacan is
many times that of its chief pyramid. The site covers
an area of about twenty-five hundred acres. Only
about one-fifth of the area has been uncovered.
There are two great pyramids, the Pyramid of the
Sun is two-hundred and sixteen feet in height with
a quadrilateral, base 721 feet by 761, and the
pyramid of the Moon is 150 feet in height with a
base 426 x 511 feet. The city was arranged around
quadrangles with a floor of dark red polished
stucco-cement. The buildings were decorated and
also the sculptures with polychrome frescos.

Long before the advent of the Aztecs the glory
of Teotihuacan had passed, and the place attracted
as much wonder and speculation then as it does
today. Until recently the place was covered with
brush and debris although the outlines of the two
great pyramids projected above the surrounding
territory. There were great quantities of broken
pottery and small Egyptian-like terra-cotta heads
scattered all over the surface. As far back as 1874
attempts were made to explore these mounds, and
the work was carried on by the National
Department of Archaeology under the direction of
Dr. Manuel Gamio. This work is still being
continued, and in addition valuable work has been
done there during the past six seasons by Dr.
George C. Vaillant, the Curator of Mexican
Archaeology of the American Museum of Natural
History, New York City. It was due to the cooperation of Dr. Vaillant in furnishing me the

reprints of five of his valuable lectures, that has
made this paper possible.
Teotihuacan is laid out symmetrically in squares
on either side of a long avenue known as the
Camino de los Muertos or the Pathway of the Dead.
It gets its name from the long rows of tombs on
either side. The arrangement is in accordance with
the astronomical measurements made at the time
they were erected. Every altar, temple, and pyramid
was so placed that the sun’s rays would strike a
particular part on a certain day in a given season
which shows the Toltecs’ astronomical knowledge.
The Highway of the Dead runs from the northnortheast to south-southwest, and at the northern
end is the Pyramid of the Moon set back in a large
plaza. Around it are temples, dwellings, and shrines
opening upon it. The most important of these
buildings is the Temple of Agriculture which was

so named on account of the decorations consisting
of fresco-friezes of flowers, birds, animals, and
vines with scenes of worshipers bringing the
products of their fields and orchards to the flaming
altars. Very little is left of their paintings, but a
copy of some of them were made at the time of
discovery and are now at the National Museum of
the City of Mexico. The scrolls coming out of the
mouths of their priests indicate speech. It is
interesting to note that similar pictographs have
been found at the Hueco Tanks, located thirty miles
east of El Paso, Texas. Going up the “Pathway of
the Dead” from the south towards the North, we
find most of the visible buildings on the eastern
side. The first is a large quadrangle known as the
“Ciudadela” with a temple of Quetzalcoatl in the
center. Here we find small pyramids and altars
placed around the four sides of the square,
according to their astronomical calculations. The
Quetzalcoatl pyramid-temple can easily be
identified by the great number of plumed serpents
and obsidian butterflies alternating in the
decorations. Next beyond is the Temple of Tlaloc,
“the god of rain” which is so closely associated
with the worship of these people. On the opposite
side of the Highway the “Subterraneos” or
undergrounds so-called because the other building
was superimposed on an earlier structure, so that
in order to see it one has to go underground. About
half-way down the “Pathway of the Dead” on the
eastern side and facing west and slightly south is
the Pyramid of the Sun from the top of which an

excellent view of the Teotihuacan ruins can be
obtained. The pyramid is a typical broad, truncated
Mexican edifice and was used as a look-out temple
and an astronomical observatory.
Near the entrance is a Museum containing terra
cotta figures, pottery bowls, semi-precious stone
carvings and artifacts as well as the products of
the local people of today, such as crops and crafts.
Many classic Toltec faces are shown in the little
clay figures found in such profusion in this vicinity.
Most of them are of the same type and show the
characteristic highly tapering forehead and pointed
chin with widely separated eyes and raised
eyebrows. The upper lip is long and the mouth
curves into a smile. The face is more frequently
that of a young man than of a young woman, and
the headdress a turban with some geometrical
design and circular earrings are worn. Sometimes
the face of an old man with a tufted beard on the
end of his chin is found with a peculiar semitic
snicker on his wise old face. These miniature
human faces were used to ornament ceremonial
pottery just as the large stone sculptures
ornamented the temples. While the faces vary much
in minor details so as to create the impression that
they are portraits of actual persons, the method of
modelling is alike. It is the contagious laughing or
smiling face which characterizes the clay human
figurines in this vicinity.

limestone but both adhered firmly and steadfastly to
their first statements. The writer then stated that the
most reasonable explanation would be that a cave could
have been filled with stalagmitic deposit which might
have encased the bones.
If the latter explanation be true the bones had no
signs of adherent stone matrix which also appears to
make this theory not very reasonable.
If the bones did not carry in their state of petrifaction
evidence of considerable age and in addition have the
limestone color and hardness with at least one
extraordinary anatomical feature and other primitive
ones, one might let the matter rest here without further
comment, but the bones deserve some description.
The ascending ramii of the lower jaw were quite
wide, the distance across the top of one from coronoid
to condyle was 2 1/16 inches. The distance from
coronoid to coronoid was 4 13/16 inches. From the
bottom of the sigmoid notch to the bottom of the
ascending ramus was 2 ¼ inches. From the back edge
of the third molar to the middle of the incisors was 2 5/
16 inches The architecture of the lower jaw is heavy
resembling in that respect and in dental equipment some
primitive jaws found near Abilene and elsewhere in
Texas. The mylohyoid ridge is flattened like the fossil
lower jaws found by George C. Martin on the coast
of Texas and the lower jaw found by the writer near
Colorado, Texas.
The teeth are much worn. In the left side all teeth
are present except the two incisors and their jaw
cavities indicate that they have been lost recently. On
the right side the teeth are all in place except the first
premolar recently lost, and the broken off canine.
The depth of the sigmoid notch is ten sixteenths of
an inch.

inches This long, flat, upturned nasal bone is like nothing
the writer has seen before on a human skull.
Nasal bones have usually decayed before other
parts of ancient skulls on account of their thinness and
fragility and consequently are rarely found in good
condition. This nasal bone from all accounts withstood
the shock of the many charges of dynamite which
shattered a hard limestone boulder and the rough
handling afterward and when examined the edges were
hard and sharp, and but slightly damaged.
We have reported all of the evidence as told to
and observed by us without injecting any conclusions
and we have none. The matter should be looked into
more fully by experts.

Other Field Trips
Field trips were made to beyond Midland, 300
miles west, and to Fort McKavitt, 150 miles southwest.
A trip was made with Dr. R. P. Glenn to a mastodon
bone site 100 miles west. Many local field trips were
made. An interesting site near Abilene visited by the
writer and W. A. Riney contained teeth and skeletal
remains of both large and small Permian Age animals.
These have not been studied or identified at this time.
