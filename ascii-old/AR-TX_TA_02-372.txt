May 2015

Abstract
AARCHER, Inc., of Annapolis, Maryland contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeological
Investigations to conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint and access right-of-way of
the proposed TX02 Harvester Monopole site in northwestern Gray County, Texas. The Federal
Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1)
requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No
Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent review of this archaeological report was provided
by the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeology Division and the Osage Nation Historic
Preservation Officer. The total area to be impacted is 2,500 square feet (<0.06-acre), in addition
to a 25-foot wide Access/Utility Easement.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on May 9, 2015. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was conducted before nine shovel tests were excavated. No prehistoric or historic
cultural material was observed either on the surface, or in any of the shovel tests.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that AARCHER, Inc. be allowed to
oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission and the Osage Nation.
No artifacts were collected or curated during this project.

funding was involved in the proposed development of the property, the Federal Communications
Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural
resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking.
In November 2014, TAAI conducted a review of cultural resources documented either on, or
within one mile of the PA, as well as other documents that may be relative for significant cultural
resources to exist within the PA. The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area.
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area.

been heavily developed along an existing rail line, commensurate the the expansion of the City
of Pampa.

Project Environment
The Project Area lies within the northwestern portion of Gray County, in the Texas Panhandle,
within the Great Plains region, in the High Plains area. The topography of Gray county is typically
flat plains in the northern and western potions of the county, giving way to Red River breaks
toward the center, eastern, and southeastern portions. More specifically, the head of the North
Fork of the Red River is in the central and eastern portions, and is intermittently fed by numerous
and flowing drainages before it exits the county. A major drainage in Gray County is McClellan
Creek, which rises in the southern portion of the county and flows northeastward to the North
Fork of the Red. A second major drainage is Cantonment Creek, which empties into the North
Fork of the Red in the northeastern corner of the county. Numerous seeps and springs still have
water in them in the southeastern corner of the county.
Native grasses, wheat, corn, grain, sorghum, and hay are found in abundance within the county’s
sandy loams and black clays. Otherwise, cottonwoods, hackberries, elms, and walnuts do well
along the many drainages. Of course, mesquite trees and brush are ever present throughout the
county where the pastures and farmlands lay fallow.
Elevation in Gray County ranges from about 3,300 feet in the northwest, to roughly 2,500 feet
in the southeast. The modern climate of the Project Area is classified as semi-arid, with an
average annual rainfall of just over 20 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout
the year, with average daily maximum temperatures averaging about 94 degrees in July, to around
23 degrees in January. The combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in
frequent droughts as well as periods of abundant moisture, resulting in a growing season of
roughly 195 days (Abbe 1996; Williams and Welker 1966).
Soils
As shown in Figure 4, the TX02 Harvester Monopole is to be constructed within Pullman clay
loam (PuA). The Pullman series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that
formed in clayey eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These
soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains or playa slopes. A typical soil pedon of
Pullman clay is as follows:
0 to 5 inches: -- brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay loam, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate fine and
medium subangular blocky structure; hard, friable; many fine and medium roots; cracks 1.0 cm
wide extend through horizon; few very fine and fine iron manganese concretions; neutral; gradual
smooth boundary.

5 to 18 inches – brown (7.5YR 4/2) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) moist; moderate medium
prismatic structure parting to moderate medium angular blocky; common pressure faces on ped
surfaces; very hard, very firm; common distinct clay films on ped surfaces; common very fine and
fine roots, cracks 1.0 cm wide extend through horizon; few fine tubular pores; few fine iron
manganese concretions; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.
18 to 33 inches – brown (7.5YR 4/3) clay, dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) moist; moderate medium
prismatic structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; common pressure faces on ped
surfaces; very hard, very firm; common distinct clay films on ped surfaces; few very fine and fine
roots; cracks 0.5 cm wide extend through horizon; few very fine and fine tubular pores; slightly
effervescent; slightly alkaline; gradual smooth boundary
33 to 52 inches – brown (7.5YR 5/4) clay, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium prismatic
structure parting to strong medium angular blocky; common pressure faces on ped surfaces; very
hard, very firm; common distinct clay films on ped surfaces; few very fine roots; few very fine and
fine tubular pores; about 3 percent calcium carbonate by volume as films, filaments, and nodules;
strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary
52 to 66 inches – strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) clay, strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) moist; moderate
medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, firm; few faint
clay films on ped surfaces; few fine and very fine tubular pores; about 25 percent calcium
carbonate by volume in the form of masses and nodules; violently effervescent; moderately
alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary
66 to 80 inches – reddish yellow (5YR 7/6) clay loam, reddish yellow (5YR 6/6) moist; weak
medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium subangular blocky; hard, friable; few
faint clay films on ped surfaces; about 40 percent calcium carbonate by volume in the form of
masses and nodules; violently effervescent; moderately alkaline; gradual smooth boundary.
In sum, the soils within the Project Area are of Pleistocene age formed on the edge of upland
playas and on gentle slopes, and are highly subject to shrink and swell typical of clays. Although
archaeological sites are often found around ancient playa peripheries, the soils are such that the
cultural material is subject to vertical displacement. As such, the potential of intact and well
stratified cultural deposits existing below the surface in Pullman clay loam is minimal at best.

Cultural Chronology
The location of the TX02 Harvester Monopole survey area presumes cultural affinities and
influences from the Southern Great Plains (Figure 5). Several scholars have offered sound but
differing arguments for cultural chronologies for the Southern Great Plains extending into
northern Texas. The cultural chronology, defined by complex (in lieu of the terms phase, interval,
or period) of the North American High Plains has been synthesized by Hofman et al. (1989), and
more recently, the Southern High Plains in Texas by Johnson and Holliday (1995) and Boyd
(1995). It should be noted that the Southern Great Plains complexes are defined by shifts in
climatic conditions and subsistence more so than changes in point style, which are indicators of
change in central and south Texas. The following discussions are primarily derived from Johnson
and Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989). All dates are approximate
and given as years before present (B.P.).
5

Pre-Clovis
Although humans may
have inhabited the
landscape before 11,500
B.P, solid evidence does
not support their
existence. Although
human behavior is
inferred on stone
artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site
(Fox et al. 1992:51-73),
all are problematic. At
Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of
north-central Texas,
rad i ocarbon dates
initially believed to be
from burned charcoal in
human campfires, and
approximating an
antiquity of 40,000
yea r s w e r e l a t e r
disproved as dates on Figure 5. Map of Texas Archaeological Regions (adapted from
natural coal (Stanford Black 1989a).
1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic
proof of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on
stable landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and
with artifacts stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances
of providing conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292294; Collins and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains
were occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between approximately
11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980) suggests
an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts include
Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people
who made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have documented
the presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture include
6

bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called "Goshen" may be present (Hofman 1989:34; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973).
By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in
Bell County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940),
archaeological evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either
extinct or otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer,
antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman
1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano
Estacado from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of
megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic
hunter-gatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game
hunting was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas,
such as deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts,
fire-cracked rock cooking features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were
small and highly mobile, an inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed
and that diagnostic types are seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern
Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the
inhabitants to broaden their diets to pursue plants and animals which would produce the same
amount of calories and protein with the same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile
points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi) argues that the area was used more frequently in the
7

Early Archaic than in the Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to “decline of bison and other
game animals on the Southern Plains.” Story (1985), however, believes that population densities
were low during this period, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
"few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on diffuse
utilization of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and
lechugilla, as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285).
Hurt (1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains
decreased, and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation
of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut
harvests in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black
1989a). Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely
scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the
acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and
processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens
are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt
this conclusion (e.g., Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock
middens are still a matter of controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach
and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus
seems to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other
plants (Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds
of accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological
community, but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
8

Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about
4500 B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites,
at least in the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as
the Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or
fell during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of
burned rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the
Blue Hole site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32
(Black et al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens
at Camp Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County
(Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in
diameter were still very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have
become less specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base
(Black 1989b:30). Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains
area, and we see an increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the
Late Archaic. However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story
(1985:44-45) believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981),
Hitzfelder Cave (Givens 1968a, b), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic
populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt
(1980) further posits that population in the Hansford County area peaked during the Late Archaic
with groups moving into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found
in the region were more closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points. The most common are
Ensor and Frio types, both of which are short, triangular points with side notches. The Frio point
also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt
(1980) presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's
(1974) contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes,
which also lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.

9

Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits mark the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including
the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and
the northern South Texas Plain (Black 1989b:32; Story 1985:45-47). Two complexes following
the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from about
2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts
into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977;
Skinner 1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).
Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into
the South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to
Hurt (1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is
mirrored in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due
to the increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the “Protohistoric”. On the Southern High Plains, Hofman (1989:91)
agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were limited
European contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history.” The
cultural context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence
of outside ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos
and Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed
in many sources (e.g., Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975;
Newcomb 1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan
Apache, and Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989;
Jones 1969; Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on
the Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache
adapted to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the
Spaniards (Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another
group of nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas
(Campbell 1991:111).

10

A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to
warfare fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among
them (Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages
have been lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994;
Johnson and Campbell 1992).
Gray County History
As discussed below, Gray County has been occupied periodically for several millennia. However,
during the Historic period, Comanches and Kiowas roamed the area following displacement of
the Apaches in the 1700s. However, a major offensive in 1874 by the U.S. Army, called the Red
River War, forced these latter groups from the Texas Panhandle and onto reservations in
Oklahoma. Without the fear of hostile Indians, ranchers began cattle ranching in the county in
1877. Five years later, in 1882, a large cattle company called the Francklyn Land and Cattle
Company purchased lands that comprised most of what was to become western Gray County.
This fledgling company was then bought out by the White Deer Lands Trust of British
Bondholders, which was then re-organized as the White Deer Lands.
The Southern Kansas Railway Company constructed a rail line from Canadian to Panhandle which
passed through the northwestern portion of the Gray County in 1887. Ranchers took advantage
of the new line and shipped thousands of cattle that way. By 1902, the Choctaw, Oklahoma and
Texas railroad built a line across southern Gray County. Ranching was the mainstay of the area’s
economy, and the population increased from 56 in 1880 to 480 by 1900. The year 1902 was
pivotal for the county. It was then that the White Deer Lands began selling off its vast holdings,
and farmers and ranchers rushed into the area. In 1902, Gray County was officially organized,
with Lefors as the county seat. Within 20 years the county’s population grew to over 4,600. Oil
and gas exploration in the1920s mushroomed with the discovery of two of three major fields close
to Pampa. Pampa then became the county seat in 1928 (Abbe 1996:296).
Today, although agricultural production contributes millions of dollars to the economy, recent
new technologies developed in the oil and gas industry have catapulted it to the forefront for the
foreseeable future.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
Gray County
In whole, the prehistoric archaeological sites documented thus far in Gray County provide
evidence of periodic occupation from the Early Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods
(roughly 6,000 to 350 years ago). The largest, earliest archaeological survey was a reservoir
survey conducted in 1974 by Panhandle Plains archaeologists. During that survey they
documented 33 sites. In all, a total of 81 archaeological sites had been recorded in Gray County
as of May 16, 2015. Sixty-seven of those are prehistoric open campsites. Other habitation sites
suggesting longer periods of occupation include two rockshelters along Mc Clellan Creek, a
pithouse site, and a large Antelope Creek phase village. Three sites are prehistoric lithic scatters,
and two are prehistoric lithic procurement/quarry sites. At one of the procurement sites where
11

Tecovas chert was exploited, mammoth bones were also found.
Subsistence-type features and artifacts include storage pits, boiling stones, ground stone manos
and metates, bison and other mammal bones, and pottery such as Borger Cord-Marked. Stone
tools manufactured from Alibates chert were found at one site, suggesting either long distance
trade or movement between Gray County and the Canadian River area to the north in the Texas
Panhandle.
Protohistoric and Historic Native American campsites are present also, such as the location of
Chief Grey Beard’s Cheyenne village on Cabin Creek in 1874, and the site of Lt. Farnsworth’s
engagement with the Cheyenne in 1874 during the Red River War. Artifacts discovered here
include horseshoes, muleshoes, buckles, horse tack, cartridges, and bullets.
The seven Anglo-American historic components recorded in Gray County consist of an 1880s
cow camp with nearby wagon cuts, a farmstead cabin from about 1910, two early 1900s trash
dumps, two early 1900s oil well sites, and Workers Progress Administration (WPA) buildings
constructed at Lake Mc Clellan between 1938 and 1940 (Atlas 2015).
Surveys and Sites Within One Mile of the TX02 Harvester Monopole
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas of Texas Archeological Sites (ATLAS
2014) indicated that two professional archaeological surveys had been conducted within one mile.
The first was conducted in 1975 by Texas Department of Highways and Transportation (TDHPT)
archaeologists, and the second was conducted in 1977 for the Soil Conservation Service (see
Figure 3).
Although there are no documented archaeological sites within one mile, there are 17 documented
historic sites or markers within one mile of the proposed TX02 Harvester Monopole site (see
Figure 3). They are briefly described as follows:

National Register Properties
Central Fire Station
Constructed in 1930, the 2-story Central Fire Station, at 203 W. Foster, continues to serve the
city of Pampa. With a simple functional form prevalent since the late 19th century, Pampa’s
Central Fire Hall is a 2-story rectangular building built of buff brick with terra cotta detailing.
Overall, the building is in very good condition, retaining a high degree of integrity. In response
to the rapid growth of the city of Pampa in the 1920’s, city leaders decided to build an up-to-date
fire station amidst other civic buildings as part of a grand building program for the newly
prosperous boomtown. Completed in 1930, the Central Fire Station served as the city’s sole fire
station until 1957, and continues service as a fire station to this day, in addition to being an
integral element in the “Million Dollar Row” of civic and commercial buildings constructed in the
late 1920s and early 1930s in downtown Pampa.

White Deer Land Company Building
The White Deer Land Co. Building (1916) is a 2-story, 2-part commercial building with eclectic
features, derived from classical and contemporary styles. The building served as the third Pampa
office built by the White Deer Land Co., the region’s primary landholder and developer from l886
through l957. The building retains a high degree of historical and architectural integrity.
US Post Office-Pampa Main
The U.S. Post Office in Pampa, Texas is an excellent example of the Spanish Rennaissance
Revival style in an institutional settting, and a showcase of federallly funded Depression-era
architecture. The massive, stone, exterior surfaces are carefully crafted and detailed, prividing a
showcase for the skills of the laborers and artisans employed on the project. The structure
contains a magnificent interior with even more complex and sophisticated detail than the exterior.
The building is one of the most ornate, stylish, and expensive Post Office structures ever erected
in the Texas Panhandle.
When the U.S. Postal Service decided to erect a new building Pampa in the early 1930s, several
factors coincided to determine the type of construction and size of the facility. The last 1920s oil
boom generated a tremendous volume of mail, and Pampa moved from a third-class to a firstclass post office in little more than two years. The need for a new postal facility in Pampa
coincided with the rapid expansion of federal public works programs to stimulate economic
recovery and provide work for the unemployed.
Pampa City Hall
Pampa City Hall (1930) is a two-story, steel frame Beaux Arts building with a raised basement
and flat roof. The building features a buff brick veneer with limestone detailing, Georgian Style
terra cotta ornamentation, and a cruciform plan. The courthouse is downtown, in the middle of
“Million Dollar Row,” a series of three compatible civic buildings (fire station, city hall and
courthouse) designed by architect William Raymond Kaufman and built in1929-30. In excellent
condition, Pampa City Hall retains its historical and architectural integrity to a high degree.
Combs-Worley Building
The Combs-Worley Building (1931) building is Pampa’s largest and finest example of the Art
Deco style, popular in the late 1920s and early 1930s, featuring strong geometric motifs. Situated
among Pampa’s “Million Dollar Row,” and in excellent condition, the Combs-Worley Building
retains a high degree of architectural integrity. The Combs-Worley Building is named for Albert
Combs and Phoebe Worley, Texas panhandle ranchers and oil investors. The Art Deco landmark
is the largest downtown commercial project of Pampa’s oil boom era, constructed of the finest
materials in a fashionable style for two of the city’s oil-wealthy citizens. It remains as one of
Pampa’s finest and most aesthetically pleasing structures, a local landmark in remarkably good
condition.
Gray County Courthouse
The Gray County Courthouse (1929) is a four-story, steel frame Beaux Arts building in
downtown, on the north end of “Million Dollar Row”, a series of three compatible civic buildings
13

(jail, city hall and courthouse) constructed in 1929-30. Adjacent to the courthouse on the east are
the Gray County Jail (1992) and the Combs-Worley Building (1931). In excellent condition, the
courthouse retains its historical and architectural integrity to a high degree.
Schneider Hotel
The Schneider Hotel is a multi-storied buff-brick building with Spanish Colonial Revival
influences of the type popular in the Southwest in the 1920's. The building is an important part
of the Pampa skyline, and was readily visible to disembarking railroad passengers, its most
important customers. Although the hotel has not operated for many years, the sturdily constructed
building remains in generally good condition. Its proximity to other substantial brick buildings
from the same time period and brick streets creates unusually cohesive streetscape.
Historical Markers
First Methodist Church of Pampa
Five charter members established the First Methodist Church in 1906, the first denomination
organized in Pampa. In 1908 a one-room white church with a steeple was built. This church site
was purchased in 1924, and a new sanctuary was completed in 1928. Additional buildings and
land were acquired as the congregation grew and renovations to the structures were made. The
church provides many educational and worship activities for its members and supports the
community with several outreach programs. The First Methodist Church has served the area for
more than 90 years.
Pioneer Cottage
Built in 1903, one year after county was organized, by settlers Wiley Vincent and wife Katie. This
small early Texas cabin has 2 rooms. In 1907, huge prairie fire missed it by only 600 yards. The
cabin was bought in 1920 by E. S. Carr, Pampa mayor, 1917-1918 and 1938-1940. He gave it
as a wedding present to daughter Edna and her husband Clifford Vincent, a son of the builders.
In 1963, the Cliff Vincents gave the cabin for use as a museum to the Pampa Genealogical and
Historical Society. It has been furnished with period pieces and restored to original appearance.
Pampa Post Office
A Post Office was established in 1892 at the Southern Kansas Railroad station house. The 7th and
present building was erected 1933-34 by the WPA. Limestone carvings depict the
agrarian-petroleum based economy: plow, wheat, oil. Of Spanish colonial design, the interior
ceiling has vigas with Indian designs in gold leaf.
First National Bank
Founded in 1906, the bank was named First State Bank, then became First National Bank after
receiving the national charter in 1907. B.E. Finley served as president until his death in 1934. The
building has ornamental bas relief that included two large eagles. It became Boatman's First in
1995 and in 1999 Bank of America.

14

White Deer Land Building and Museum
This is the last headquarters of the White Deer Land Co. (1886-1957), organized after English
bondholders foreclosed on the Francklyn Land and Cattle Co., formed in 1882 with some 631,000
acres in what became Gray, Roberts, Carson and Hutchinson Counties. The company was a
strong influence in settlement of the area. The firm managers were George Tyng, T.D. Hobart,
C.P. Buckler and M.K. Brown. In 1970 the museum was organized. The adjacent Holland Wing
at 112 S. Cuyler was remodeled in 1995. The annex at 124 S. Cuyler was acquired in 1988 and
remodeled in 2007.
Fairview Cemetery
The Historic Texas Cemetery marker was awarded during Fairview's centennial year. The first
burial was of C.B. Dobbs, 8/23/1904. Over 12,000 were buried in the cemetery at the time fo the
centennial.
Note: the following four markers are all closely located on the courthouse square.

Lest We Forget; Gray County; 50th Year Anniversary; 1902-1952; Dedicated to our early day
pioneers, through whose efforts Gray County was established. And who contributed so much to
our 50 years of progress.
Pampa
In 1888 a telegraph station on the Southern Kansas Railroad developed here, and was named
Glasgow. Renamed Sutton a year later, a post office was established in 1892 and the town was
named Pampa by George Tyng (d. 1906), manager of the White Deer Land Company. Surveyor
A. H. Doucette (1884-1964) laid out the town in 1902. The first school opened in 1903 and the
first church was organized in 1906. J. N. Duncan (1858-1941) became Pampa's first mayor in
1912. Following a 1920s oil boom, the county seat was moved here from Lefors in 1928.
Pampa City Hall
Construction of this and other major downtown buildings in Pampa came as a result of the Texas
Panhandle Oil Boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Designed by architect William R.
Kaufman to complement the Gray County Courthouse, which he also designed, the City Hall was
completed in December 1930. The beaux arts style building features triumphal arch entrances with
classical detailing and pilaster elements around the perimeter.
Peter W. Gray
Star and Wreath County Named for Texas Confederate 1819-1876 Virginia-born, came to Texas
1838. Aided 1839 removal Texas Shawnees. Officer in Milam Guards, Texas Republic. Political,
cultural leader in Houston, Republic, State, and Confederacy: he was district attorney, judge,
Justice Texas Supreme Court, Legislator in Texas and C.S.A. Delegate to Texas Secession
Convention that raised troops to seize U.S. forts, provided for Texas frontier defense, and ratified
C.S.A. Constitution. Gray in 1864 became Treasury Agent for the "amputated" C.S.A. Sector
West of the Mississippi River. There, in effect, he was Treasury Secretary for a land in chaos.
15

Smuggled currency was scarce. Often it was hijacked. No western press could be found to print
notes. Couriers and Pony Express were Gray's “wireless” to the Confederate capital. Ammunition,
arms, medicines, factory goods vital to the war effort had to be imported for Arkansas, Louisiana,
Missouri, as well as for Texas. Blockade-runners exported cotton via Havana to Europe. Cattle
and cotton went to market in Mexico, as Gray served the gallant Confederacy.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with shovel testing. The topics addressed were site
type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework was structured
around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
Prior to the archaeological survey, the area to be impacted had been clearly delineated with survey
stakes (see for example, Figures 6 and 7). In Accordance with Texas Historical Commission
(THC), Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, and Osage Nation
Historic Preservation Office Standards, a systematic and thorough pedestrian survey of the
delineated tract was conducted.
Seven shovel tests 40-cm in diameter were then excavated to 80 cmbs (see Figure 8). Soils
matrices were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. In accordance with a designed research plan,
all redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be
placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test. The results of shovel testing are shown
in Table 1. Soils colors are based on standard Munsell color charts in dry soils, and depths are
presented in centimeters below the surface (cmbs).

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
As shown in Figures 6 and 7, surface visibility ranged between 40-90 percent across the site. The
surface of the tower footprint area and access/utility easement was very uneven and hummocky,
suggesting significant disturbance had occurred in the not too distant past, either from brush and
tree clearing or construction activities. Pavement chunks, rounded pea gravels, angular limestone
road base, and modern trash were common.
A total of seven shovel tests were placed within the tower’s footprint and the access/utility
(Figure 8). The results of all seven shovel tests were generally generic in terms of soils, sediments,
and inclusions by level. That is, the upper 0-15 centimeters (cm) exhibited common grass rootlets
within heavily disturbed brown clay loam. Below that, from roughly 15-40 cm, we observed
brown clay loam with vertical cracking to 1/8" wide. The subsoil from 40-80 cm consisted of
18

reddish brown clay loam that was more compact with depth, and with a notable increase in
calcium carbonate fines and clay with depth.
The results of shovel testing were recorded on standard shovel test forms, are on file at Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations, and are available upon request. No prehistoric or historic
cultural material was observed either on the surface or in any of the seven shovel tests.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough pedestrian survey of the surface within the Project Area was conducted, and seven
shovel tests were excavated. The surface was very hummocky and uneven, suggesting either
mechanical brush and tree clearing and/or mechanical dumping of fill. Modern trash, pavement
chunks, and rounded pea gravels were observed on the surface, as well as in the upper levels of
the shovel tests. No evidence of neither prehistoric nor historic occupation was found either on
or below the surface. Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently
designed by the project sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any
properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or
inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed
without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during
construction within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds
are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant,
and by the Texas Historical Commission and the Osage Nation Historic Preservation Officer.
