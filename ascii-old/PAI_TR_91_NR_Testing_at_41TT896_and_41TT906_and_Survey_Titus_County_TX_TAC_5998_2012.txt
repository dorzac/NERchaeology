abstract and management summary
Prewitt and Associates, Inc., was contracted by PTP Transportation, LLC, to perform
archeological investigations for Titus County in the proposed final alignment of FM 1000. The work,
performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5998, consisted of archeological test excavations at
sites 41TT896 and 41TT906 to assess their eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places and designation as State Archeological Landmarks and archeological survey of three parcels.
Fieldwork was done in JulyâAugust 2011, JanuaryâFebruary 2012, and July 2012 and required
about 99 person-days of effort.
Test excavations at 41TT896 consisted of 23 backhoe trenches, eight 1x1-m test units, and
13 shovel tests. This effort revealed low-density scatters of prehistoric chipped stone artifacts and
twentieth-century historic artifacts, along with a single historic feature. No prehistoric cultural
features were identified. Recovered projectile points and the absence of prehistoric ceramics suggest
that the prehistoric component dates to the Late Archaic period. The historic component relates
to a farm complex outside the project area. Neither component at 41TT896 has the capacity to
contribute important information, and thus the site is ineligible for National Register listing or
State Archeological Landmark designation. Test excavations at 41TT906 consisted of 15 backhoe
trenches and four 1x1-m test units; the final task consisted of mechanically scraping 1,864 m2 of
the site to ensure that no Native American burials were present. These efforts revealed a lowdensity scatter of prehistoric chipped stone artifacts and ceramics and a single disturbed burned
rock feature representing sparse Late Caddo, Archaic, and perhaps late Paleoindian components.
The investigated part of 41TT906 has no capacity to contribute important information and thus is
ineligible for National Register listing or State Archeological Landmark designation.
Investigation of Survey Areas 1â3 included the excavation of 50 shovel tests across 13 acres.
No archeological sites were identified in Survey Areas 1 or 2. A historic-age residential structure
in Survey Area 2 was moved onto the property in the 1960sâ1970s; it does not possess integrity of
place or materials and is not eligible for listing in the National Register. Historic site 41TT918 was
identified in Survey Area 3. It consists of a historic scatter that represents outbuildings associated
with a twentieth-century farmstead located outside the project area to the southeast. It has no
capacity to contribute important information and thus is ineligible for National Register listing or
State Archeological Landmark designation.
All artifacts and records generated by this project are curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.

acknoWledgments
The authors would like to thank the owners or executors of the various properties in
the project area for granting right of entry to conduct archeological investigations and, in some
instances, granting permission for artifact collection. Thomas J. Walden Jr., Mike Mahar, and others
of Property Acquisition Services, Inc., established contacts with the owners and executors, obtained
right of entry, and relayed questions about the history of certain parcels between the archeologist
and pertinent family members. This project could not have been completed without the assistance
of Terry Plucker of PTP Transportation, LLC, who maintained communication with the necessary
parties concerning right of entry, means of physical access, and artifact collection policies. Terry
also assisted with marking the limits of the project area at Survey Area 1 and 41TT906, installing
barbed-wire fencing at the latter, and various other aspects of fieldwork. John E. Dockall performed
much of the logistical work during the initial planning and preparatory phases of this project. Dennis
Cameron of Cameron Auto Salvage provided mechanical equipment and equipment operators. Steven
âGooseâ Brooks capably operated a backhoe during trenching and backfilling and assisted with fence
installation at 41TT896 and 41TT906. Jose Gomezâs expertise with a trackhoe proved invaluable
during mechanical scraping and backfilling at 41TT906. Backfilling the scraped areas at 41TT906
was expedited by Harold Pennyâs efficient bulldozer work. At Prewitt and Associates, Ross C. Fields
served as principal investigator, and Damon A. Burden was the project archeologist. John Dockall,
Jennifer McWilliams, Aaron Norment, Tim Griffith, Virginia Hatfield, and Rob Thrift served as field
archeologists and assisted with various aspects of this project in and out of the field. Sandy Hannum
created field maps, and she and Brian Wootan produced the figures used in this report. Stephanie
Katauskas and Amy Dase conducted the historic archival research. Ross Fields edited the report,
and Jennifer McWilliams photographed the artifacts.

Introduction

Landmark designation. The survey identified
one new historic archeological site (41TT918)
and a historic-age building; neither is eligible
for the National Register, and 41TT918 does
not warrant designation as a State Archeological Landmark.
The remainder of this report consists of
the following sections: Environmental Setting;
Previous Investigations; Testing at 41TT896;
Testing and Mechanical Scraping at 41TT906;

This report presents the results of test
excavations at archeological sites 41TT896
and 41TT906 and archeological survey of three
parcels in Titus County, Texas (Figure 1). This
work was performed by Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., for PTP Transportation, LLC (on behalf of
Titus County), under Texas Antiquities Permit
No. 5998. This project was conducted in response
to the planned realignment of the FM 1000
corridor, which will connect the proposed U.S.
Highway 271 Relief Route on the west with existing FM 1735 on the east. FM 1000 is a two-lane
roadway project that will include construction
on new location, widening an existing roadway,
and construction of two new bridges: one over the
Union Pacific Railroad tracks west of existing
U.S. Highway 271 and the other over the Hart
Creek floodplain (OâKelly et al. 2009). The total
length of the FM 1000 project is approximately
7.97 km, and the width of the proposed alignment ranges from 40 to 79 m; the total Area of
Potential Effects is 136 acres. All work done was
in proposed new right of way.
Sites 41TT896 and 41TT906 had been identified during a previous survey for the project
(OâKelly et al. 2009), but they needed additional
investigation to determine if they are eligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places (36 CFR 60; 36 CFR 800) or designation
as State Archeological Landmarks (13 TAC 26).
The three parcels surveyed (Survey Areas 1â3)
were investigated because parts or all of them
were not included in the previous survey. Due
to right-of-entry complications, test excavations
and survey were conducted in two episodesâin
JulyâAugust 2011 and JanuaryâFebruary
2012âand required about 75 person-days of effort. Upon review of an initial draft report on the
work, the Texas Department of Transportationâs
Environmental Affairs Division requested that
mechanical scraping be done at 41TT906 to determine whether Native American burials were
present. This was conducted in July 2012 and
required about 24 person-days of effort.
Testing involved backhoe trenching and
manual excavation of test units and shovel
tests, and mechanical stripping was performed
with a trackhoe. Survey involved pedestrian
transects and shovel testing. The testing found
that neither 41TT896 nor 41TT906 is eligible for
National Register listing or State Archeological

environmental setting
The project area is within the Western Gulf
Coastal Plain, and regional geology is associated
with ancestral marine and deltaic deposits of
the Gulf of Mexico (Fenneman 1938; Sellards
et al. 1932). Rocks derived from these deposits
crop out to form a series of southeastward-dipping cuestas or escarpments. These basement
rocks are overlain by clays and sands associated
with the lower Eocene Wilcox Formation. These
sediments were deposited as channel and overbank sediments of the Mount Pleasant fluvial
system (Fisher 1965:105). The latter is a source
of usable lithic material in gravel form in the
project vicinity. Other sources of usable gravels
include Pleistocene fluvial terrace deposits and
Holocene alluvial deposits along major and some
minor drainages in the area. Chert, quartzite,
and silicified wood commonly occur in these
depositional environments.
Regional topography consists of gently rolling to hilly uplands dissected by numerous small
and medium-sized tributaries of Big Cypress
Creek. Site 41TT896 and Survey Areas 2 and 3
are in upland settings east of Hart Creek. Site
41TT906 and Survey Area 1 are located adjacent
to and on the Hart Creek floodplain. Except for
the Quaternary alluvial deposits mapped along
Hart Creek in Survey Area 1, the subsurface
geologic units mapped in the various project
segments consist of the Eocene-age Wilcox
Group (undivided), Carrizo Sand, and Queen
City Formations. These deposits include sands,
silty and sandy clays, and clays with siltstone
and ironstone concretions (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1979).

corridor.

2â5 percent slopes (Roberts 1990; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 2012a). Kirvin gravelly fine sandy
loam with 3â8 percent slopes is mapped in an
elevated area in the northwest part of Survey

Area 3 that includes 41TT918. Bowie series soils
typically are well drained and found on broad,
very gently to moderately sloping interfluves
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 2012b). Kirvin

?

gravelly fine sandy loam is located on gently
to strongly sloping, well-drained oval ridges
(Roberts 1990).
Site 41TT906 is mapped on Woodtell fine
sandy loam with 5â20 percent slopes and frequently flooded Nahatche loam silty clay loam
(Roberts 1990; U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources Conservation Service 2012a).
Survey Area 1 is mapped on the same Nahatche
silty clay loam and on frequently flooded Estes
clay loam. Woodtell series soils are located in
well-drained areas on gently sloping ridge tops
or stream divides and strongly to moderately
steep upland side slopes (U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service 2012b). The Nahatche series consists of
deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on floodplains (Roberts 1990; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service
2012b). The Estes series is characterized by very
deep, nearly level, somewhat poorly drained soils
on the floodplains of larger streams (Roberts
1990; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural
Resources Conservation Service 2012b).
Survey Area 2 is in an area mapped as
having Freestone fine sandy loam with 1â3 percent slopes and Woodtell fine sandy loam with
2â5 percent slopes (Roberts 1990; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 2012a). Both are found in gently
sloping to moderately steep and moderately
well-drained areas (Roberts 1990). Freestone
soils are on nearly level to gently sloping upland
terrace remnants, stream divides, and stream
terraces (Roberts 1990; U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service 2012b).
The area climate is characterized by cool
short winters and hot summers due to the
presence of moist tropical air from the Gulf of
Mexico. Total annual precipitation is about 45
inches, with 53 percent of the annual total (24
inches) falling between April and September
(Roberts 1990:2â3). The project area is within
the Austroriparian biotic province, which is
part of the Forested Coastal Plain or post oak
savanna (Blair 1950; Fisher 1965:10). Post oak
and blackjack oak typically dominate the overstory within this region. Other trees common
along river and stream floodplains include red
oak, willow oak, water oak, beech, and sweet
gum. Various pines, hickory, cypress, elm, ash,
maple, and cottonwood are also common.

Regional fauna provided a diverse array
of resources for both prehistoric and historic
inhabitants. Blair (1950:98â100) notes the occurrence of at least 47 mammal species in modern
and recent times, together with 29 species of
snake, 10 species of lizard, 2 land turtles, and
35 species of amphibian. Various species of fish
and mussels are abundant in area streams and
rivers, and crayfish occur in some localities.
Characteristic mammal species include whitetailed deer, opossum, cottontail rabbit, swamp
rabbit, several kinds of squirrel, beaver, raccoon,
fox, black bear, and armadillo.
previous investigations
Review of the Texas Historical Commissionâs
Archeological Sites Atlas indicates that many
known sites are within 1 km of the various parts
of the current project area. Personnel with GeoMarine, Inc., recorded a historic site (41TT768)
along State Highway 49, about 1.1 km northnorthwest of 41TT896 and within 0.9 km of
Survey Area 3. Site 41TT898, a historic site
recorded during survey of the FM 1000 corridor,
is approximately 60 m west of the west end of
Survey Area 2.
Fourteen archeological sites are within
1.0 km of 41TT906 and Survey Area 1. Of these,
7 are unknown prehistoric (41TT32, 41TT613,
41TT615, 41TT895, and 41TT907â41TT909),
1 is a historic farmstead (41TT897), 1 is a segment of a historic railroad grade (41TT910),
3 are potential Archaic to Caddo (41TT33,
41TT46, and 41TT610), 1 is Titus phase Caddo
(41TT34), and 1 is multicomponent unknown
prehistoric and historic (41TT894). Eight
of these sites are within 250 m of 41TT906
(41TT32â41TT34, 41TT895, 41TT897, and
41TT907â41TT909) and represent occupations
dating from the Archaic to Late Prehistoric
Caddo and Historic periods.
Sites 41TT894, 41TT895, 41TT897, and
41TT907â41TT910 were recorded by PBS&J
in 2008 (OâKelly et al. 2009). Sites 41TT610,
41TT613, and 41TT615 were recorded during
a survey conducted for the Texas Water Development Board in 1989. Milton Bell recorded
41TT32â41TT34 and 41TT46 in the early 1970s.
Site 41TT32, which was partially overlapped
by the first and third proposed FM 1000 alignments, was revisited by PBS&J in 2008 (OâKelly
et al. 2009).

originally located in this area likely have been
disturbed by previous road construction, ditch
excavation, and subsurface utilities installation.

Setting
Site 41TT896 was recorded as a multicomponent prehistoric and historic site during the
PBS&J survey of the first proposed FM 1000
alignment in 2008 (OâKelly et al. 2009). The
site is in open pasture at the eastern terminus
of the proposed highway corridor, primarily
west of its intersection with existing FM 1735
(Figure 2). The site is on the southwest flank of
a hill that peaks northeast of FM 1735. Surface
elevations in the site area vary from about 445 to
435 ft above mean sea level. Area terrain drops
gradually to a small, intermittent, southeastnorthwest drainage about 30 m southwest of
the site (Figure 3).
The site as originally defined was almost
entirely southwest of FM 1735, had dimensions of 90 m northwest-southeast by 30â50 m
northeast-southwest, and encompassed an approximate area of 2,700 m2. The site boundary
was expanded as a result of the current investigation, with the site likely extending beyond the
limits of proposed new right of way southwest
and northeast of FM 1735. The modified site
boundary is 120 m northwest-southeast by about
50â90 m northeast-southwest and is approximately 7,935 m2. This includes the main part
of the site in new right of way southwest of the
FM 1735 corridor, the area within the existing
FM 1735 right of way, and the approximately 18m-wide new right of way northeast of FM 1735
(horizontal Area of Potential Effects = 2 acres).
The full extents of the areas within new right of
way northeast and southwest of FM 1735, which
were privately owned at the time of fieldwork,
were investigated. The area within the existing FM 1735 right of way was not investigated
because it is extensively disturbed.
Project schematics call for raising the existing FM 1735 road profile 0.6â1.5 m across the
site area. The east terminus of the new highway is to be constructed on a 0.9â1.5-m-thick
road grade set on the existing ground surface
as it transitions downward from FM 1735 to
a proposed cut section west-southwest of the
intermittent drainage. Thus, the vertical Area
of Potential Effects within the site area should
be 1 m or less. Construction impacts within the
existing FM 1735 right of way are considered
insignificant, since any archeological deposits

Previous Work
During the 2008 survey, the eastern terminus of the FM 1000 project corridor was
designated a high-probability area for historic
resources based on identification of a farmstead
in the vicinity of 41TT896 on a 1909 Titus
County soils map and an early Titus County
highway map (OâKelly et al. 2009:81; Texas
State Highway Department 1940; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Field Operations Bureau
of Soils 1909). The survey crew excavated 28
shovel tests to define the site area. Nine tests
were positive, yielding a total of 14 artifacts (9
historic and 5 prehistoric). The shovel test assemblage included a biface fragment, 4 pieces
of quartzite debitage, 2 pieces of glass (clear
and aqua), a whiteware sherd, a nail and 4 nail
fragments, and a handmade brick fragment.
Prehistoric artifacts were distributed to a depth
of 30 cm, while historic artifacts were recovered
to 50 cm. A concentration of bricks was noted
at the base of a bois dâarc tree approximately
50 m northwest of the site outside the proposed
FM 1000 corridor. The makerâs marks on the
bricks indicated they were produced in nearby
Winfield, Texas.
A quartzite Yarbrough dart point was recovered as an isolated surface find northeast of
FM 1735, âby a buried gas line at the fence line
of a plowed fieldâ (OâKelly et al. 2009:85). According to the site sketch map, the point was just
northeast of the FM 1735 right-of-way fence line
(OâKelly et al. 2009:Figure 24). No shovel tests
were excavated in that area, and no other artifacts were identified during surface inspection
of the area, leading the investigators to suggest
that the point was probably redeposited âfrom
the main part of the site,â which was presumably southwest of the artifactâs location (OâKelly
et al. 2009:90).
PBS&J reported that the historic artifacts
recovered at 41TT896 were possibly representative of a historic trash dump or outbuilding
associated with a nearby residence, and that the
material was suggestive of a domestic occupation dating from the late nineteenth through
early twentieth centuries. The brick scatter

Methods of Investigation

northwest of the site was considered the possible
location of the associated farmstead. The 1909
soils map depicts structures in the immediate
vicinity, but no structures are depicted in that
location on subsequent aerial photographs or
the 1964 USGS map (Tobin International, Ltd.
1935; U.S. Army Map Service 1949; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization
and Conservation Service 1963). Historians
were unable to run the chain of title prior to
a 1947 conveyance of the parcel (OâKelly et al.
2009:81â82, 85, 89).
The prehistoric component was considered
likely to represent short-term, possibly multiple
seasonal occupations, with some dating to the
Late Archaic period based on the presence of the
Yarbrough point (OâKelly et al. 2009:78, 85, 90).
Based on these findings, PBS&J recommended
that 41TT896 did not qualify for inclusion in
the National Register or designation as a State
Archeological Landmark. Consequently, no
further work was recommended (OâKelly et al.
2009:90, 91). However, the Texas Department
of Transportationâs Environmental Affairs Division concluded that archeological testing of the
prehistoric component was needed to determine
whether intact buried Archaic deposits are
present.

Prior to fieldwork, the proposed project
limits and the 41TT896 site boundary were
uploaded onto a handheld Trimble GPS receiver
to establish the spatial parameters for testing
in the proposed FM 1000 right of way southwest of FM 1735 and in the expanded right of
way northeast of FM 1735. At the beginning of
fieldwork, existing fence lines and a compass and
tape were used to place stakes for 19 backhoe
trenches (Trenches 1â11 and 13â20) southwest
of the highway (Figure 4). These trenches were
oriented roughly perpendicular to the southwest
FM 1735 right of way fence line, with the closest
trenches starting approximately 5 m off the fence
to avoid a subsurface water line approximately
2â3 m from the fence. Trenches were spaced
approximately 10 m apart northwest-southeast
and 5 m apart northeast-southwest. Trench 12
was laid out perpendicular to a surface swale
near the northwest edge of the site following
excavation of the surrounding trenches. All
trenches in this area were about 10 m long, except for Trench 1, which was 4.5 m long.

These trenches also were about 10 m long.
Trench excavation was completed using
a backhoe fitted with a 0.9-m-wide toothless
?

bucket. A total of 222.7 linear meters of trenches
were excavated among 23 trenches (up to 24
trenches were proposed in the scope of work),
which ranged from 4.5 to 10.8 m in length (Table
1). Not counting Trench 1, the average trench
length was 9.9 m. Trenches 1â20 account for
6 percent of the site area southwest of FM 1735,
and Trenches 21â23 account for 2 percent of the
area northeast of the FM 1735. Trenches ranged
from 0.25 to 0.63 m deep, for an average of
0.50 m. Approximately 112 m3 of sediment was
removed during trench excavation. Sediments
corresponding with one or more zones of the
Bt horizon were exposed in all of the trenches.
Trench 1 truncated an infilled shovel test (possibly PBS&J Shovel Test 15).

A barbed wire fence was erected around the
trenched area southwest of FM 1735 to keep out
livestock during the field investigation. Due to a
shortage of fence wire, Trenches 22 and 23 were
cleaned, recorded, and backfilled on the same
day they were excavated. The remaining fencing
material was set around Trench 21, which was
left open for subsequent test unit excavation
because visual inspection suggested that it had
the most intact (albeit still disturbed) sediment
profile of the trenches in this part of 41TT896.
Trench walls and floors were monitored for
artifacts, cultural features, and other anomalies
during mechanical excavation, and observed
artifacts were collected and retained for analysis. All of the trench side walls and some of the

trench ends were scraped and cleaned with
shovels and trowels. A Trench Excavation Record
Form was used to record trench dimensions, the
presence/absence of artifacts and cultural deposits, and other characteristics in each trench. In
addition, the sediments exposed were described
and recorded, and sketches showing observed
strata across the length of one trench wall were
completed for all trenches. Photographs were
taken of the sediment columns in Trenches 3, 6,
11, 14, 16, 18, and 21â23, and 2-m-wide profiles
were completed at the locations of planned test
units in Trenches 3, 6, 10, 11, 14, and 18.
Once trench cleaning and recording were
completed, seven 1x1-m test units were set off
the walls of the above-mentioned trenches and
Trench 21 (see Figure 4). Test Units 1 and 2 were
placed above anomalies visible in Trenches 3
and 18, respectively. Test Units 4â8 were spaced
out across the site area. Test Unit 3 was placed
near the top of a low rise that crested between
Trenches 15, 16, and 18 in the west part of the
site, since almost 70 percent of the trench-derived prehistoric artifacts came from those three
trenches, all of which truncated the outer edges
of the landform. Test Unit 3 was positioned to
recover a controlled artifact sample from the
thicker surface sediments on the rise.
A datum was set adjacent to the corner with
the highest surface elevation in each test unit,
with datum heights typically 10 cm above the
surface. Unit excavation typically proceeded in
10-cm levels below datum. These elevations were
later converted to below-surface measurements.
Slight discrepancies in the first-level measurements for Test Units 3 and 4 mark adjustments
made to end each level at the next 10-cm increment after surpassing variation in surface slope.
Variation in the thickness of the last levels in
Test Units 6 and 7 reflect judgments made when
unit excavation extended into Bt horizon sediments. In Test Unit 2, only half of the bottom
level was excavated since it was completely
within the Bt horizon. Test unit excavation was
terminated at or slightly below the Bt horizon
contact. Unit depths ranged from 35 to 50 cm
(see Table 1). Excavation Record Forms were
used to record information for the test units.
Completed units were photographed.
A total of 3.34 m3 of sediment was excavated
from the test units. Though the total volume is
less than the 5â6 m3identified as the maximum
in the scope of work, the number of units exca-

vated is appropriate given the lack of prehistoric
features (the scope specified a minimum of five
test units in the absence of features) and the
sparse archeological remains. The level of effort
expended in testing this site (19 person-days) is
considered to represent a reasonable and goodfaith effort, given its size and contents. All of
the excavated sediment was screened through
1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth, and all artifacts
were collected and retained for analysis.
Eight shovel tests (seven were proposed in
the scope of work) were excavated in two transects in the proposed new right of way northeast
of FM 1735 (see Figure 4). Transects followed
the alignment of the existing right of way fence
line. These tests were excavated prior to trench
excavation in that part of the site. The southeast
third of this segment of the site was not tested
because it includes the yard and driveway of an
occupied residence. Five additional shovel tests
were excavated within the proposed new right
of way southwest of FM 1735 to confirm the
boundary of the site in this direction. All tests
extended to the B horizon at depths varying from
25 to 65 cm (average = 43 cm). The tests were
excavated in 20-cm levels, and the sediments
removed were screened through 1/4-inch-mesh
hardware cloth. A Shovel Test Record Form was
used to record brief sediment descriptions and
notes about artifact recovery.
The artifacts recovered were taken to the
Prewitt and Associates laboratory in Austin.
Laboratory processing consisted of washing,
identifying, and cataloging the recovered cultural materials. Materials were classified according to the following categories: debitage,
chipped stone tool, vertebrate faunal element,
glass, historic ceramic, metal, brick fragment,
and other. Artifact types or styles were identified
within each category when possible. Lithic material type was identified for each of the chipped
stone artifacts. The assemblage was prepared for
curation according to the standards of the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, where the artifacts
and all field records are curated.
Site Sediments
In general, the trenches southwest of
FM 1735 exhibited three sediment zones consisting of a thin Ap horizon above a thicker E horizon
that was underlain by a Bt horizon (Figure 5).

The Ap horizons were composed of soft,

and sandy loams with common small to fine
roots, some small hematitic gravels, and occasional historic and prehistoric artifacts. Widely
dispersed carbon flecks were observed in this
horizon in about a quarter of the trenches.
Ferrous staining was often visible in the lower
portion of this zone, typically along the transition between the Ap and E horizons. Distinct Ap
horizons were discontinuous in some of trenches.
Two Ap horizons were identified in an area of
deeper, extensively bioturbated surface sands
in Trench 11. The lower of the two contained a
slightly higher percentage of clay than the upper

this horizon in many of the trench exposures,
particularly along the Ap-E transition. The upper and lower portions of the E horizons often
exhibited mottling derived from the overlying
and underlying stratigraphic zones. Clay content
increased with depth within the E horizon in
about half the trenches.
The basal zone in most trenches consisted
of slightly hard sandy clay, sandy clay loam, and
clay, sometimes with redoximorphic concentrations and ferrous concretions. Sediment structure varied from massive to strongly granular
and is probably blocky to prismatic when dry.
Infilled vertic features were discernible in some
exposures. Frequencies of small to medium-sized

evident on the stem and short blade margin remnants. A bending fracture truncated this point
about 8 mm above the shoulders. This specimen
is 24.23 mm long and 36.93 mm wide and has a
maximum thickness of 7.16 mm. The well-made
medial blade fragment was recovered from the
floor of Trench 15 after cleaning the northwest
trench wall (Figure 7d). The margin remnants
are straight to slightly convex. Unifacial retouch
is evident on one side of the fragment. The bending fractures at the distal and proximal ends
are suggestive of manufacturing failure. This
fragment is 22.48 mm long, 26.28 mm wide, and
5.33 mm thick.
The 48 pieces of debitage consist of 21 flakes,
25 flake fragments, and 2 pieces of shatter; 33
are quartzite, 12 are chert (11 local and 1 nonlocal), and 3 are silicified wood. The majority are
derived from hard-hammer reduction. The assemblage includes 3 soft-hammer flakes, and 1
of these, a white chert flake derived from bifacial
retouch, is the only obviously nonlocal material
in the assemblage. No obvious flake tools are
present, but a short margin on 1 quartzite flake
fragment retains flake scars that may be the
result of unifacial retouch.
The majority of the prehistoric artifacts
(96 percent) were recovered from the surface,
seven trenches, and six test units southwest
of FM 1735; the lack of artifacts in the shovel
tests west and northwest of this area indicates
that the site does not extend beyond the boundary shown on Figure 4 (see Table 2). Two flake
fragments collected in the lowest level of Test
Unit 8 are the only prehistoric artifacts recovered northeast of FM 1735, indicating that the
prehistoric deposits are very sparse in that area.
Of the 38 artifacts from test units, 15 came from
Level 2, and 9 (including a Gary point fragment)
came from Level 3. Level 4 yielded 6 items, and
Levels 1 and 5 each contained 4. Hence, 74 percent were in the upper ca. 30 cm. Test Units 3
and 5 are the only units in which prehistoric
artifacts were recovered from all levels above
the Bt horizon contact.
Twenty-eight of the 50 prehistoric artifacts
recovered southwest of FM 1735 were from the
discrete low rise at the southwest edge of the
site: 18 from Test Unit 3 atop the rise, 9 from Test
Unit 2 and Trenches 15 and 18, and 1 from the
surface. In addition, 2 flakes were recovered from
Trench 16 backdirt downslope from the rise, and
9 artifacts were recovered from Trenches 11 and

Results of Investigations
Testing at 41TT896 identified a possible
historic feature (Feature 1) and recovered 52
prehistoric artifacts, 59 historic artifacts, and an
unburned faunal bone fragment. Artifacts were
recovered from the surface, 2 shovel tests, all 8
test units, 12 trenches, and the possible historic
feature (Table 2).
No cultural features relating to Native
American use of 41TT896, or even scattered
burned rocks indicating disturbed features, were
identified. The 52 prehistoric artifacts consist of
4 chipped stone tools and 48 pieces of lithic debitage. Aside from 1 small flake of nonlocal chert,
the assemblage is composed of locally available
Ogallala chert, quartzite, and silicified wood.
The chipped stone tools consist of three
Gary dart points and a medial dart point blade
fragment (Figure 7). All were fashioned from
quartzite. Common in east Texas and Louisiana,
Gary points are characterized by relatively crude
manufacture, a thick triangular body, squared
shoulders, and a contracting stem (Turner and
Hester 1999:123). These traits describe well
the point fragment found on the surface prior
to trench excavation (Figure 7a). Made from
coarser material than the other specimens, this
proximal-medial dart point fragment has a short
triangular stem and concave blade margins.
The tip was damaged and reworked prior to the
bending fracture that left the point in its current
condition. This dart point fragment is 40.12 mm
long and 31.32 mm wide and has a maximum
thickness of 9.10 mm. The Gary dart point found
in a thin layer of backdirt along the northwest
wall of Trench 18 has a short triangular stem,
prominent shoulders, and concave blade edges
(Figure 7b). Slight thermal discoloration is evident on the distal half of the blade. This dart
point is 53.95 mm long and 30.69 mm wide and
has a maximum thickness of 8.49 mm. The basal
portion of a Gary point recovered from Test Unit
7, Level 3, has a well-formed triangular stem and
shoulders (Figure 7c). Pressure-flaking scars are

14 and Test Unit 5 northwest of the rise. Thus,
78 percent of the prehistoric artifacts recovered
southwest of FM 1735 are from a roughly 40x20m area in the southwest portion of the site. This
concentration of materials could represent a
single occupation or activity area, although the
sparseness of materials, lack of features, and
lack of datable materials and situation in a
nonaggrading landform make it impossible to
be sure. Further, the modern surface topography
suggests that some artifacts in this part of the
site could be out of context, having been moved
downslope by erosion and overland flow. The
other prehistoric artifacts found on this side
of the highway were distributed between Test

Units 1, 4, and 7 and Trenches 5 and 10, which
span almost the full length of the tested area.
In contrast, the historic materials were
scattered widely and sparsely southwest of
FM 1735 and were most abundant northeast of
the highway. The single possible historic feature,
Feature 1, is an infilled disturbance identified
at the northwest end of Trench 22. Although
believed to be of historic age, pit fill has been
in place long enough for development of an Ap
horizon across the top of the feature. Visible in
both trench walls, Feature 1 was clearly parabolic in cross section in the northeast wall and
more roughly so in the southwest wall, with
more irregular and subtler margins (Figure

These disturbances could relate to the buried
water line between Trench 22 and the right-ofway fence to the southwest, or perhaps to other
activities associated with the residence not far
to the southeast. The nature of Feature 1, the
recovery of a historic sherd from it, its apparent
association with the square depression, and its
location well removed from the part of the site
containing most of the prehistoric artifacts indicate that it is of historic age.
The 59 historic artifacts consist of 26 pieces
of glass, 18 historic ceramic sherds, 12 metal
fragments, a brick fragment, a piece of plastic,
and fragments of a wood and graphite pencil. In
addition, a faunal rib fragment was recovered
along with historic artifacts in Shovel Test 8.
The bone is unburned, bears no tool marks, and
is likely of recent derivation.
The glass assemblage includes a complete
Coca-Cola bottle from the Pittsburg, Texas,
Bottling Works and pieces of clear, brown, aquamarine, solarized amethyst, milk, and possible
white glass. Identifiable fragments include
parts of bottles (n = 6), a jar base fragment, an
embossed bottle/jar fragment, and a possible
cap liner fragment. The remainder include a lip
fragment (vessel type indeterminate), pieces of
indeterminate vessels (n = 6), flat pieces (n = 5),
curved sherds (n = 3), and a piece of unidentifiable glass.
The historic ceramic assemblage is composed of pieces of porcelain (n = 5), semiporcelain (n = 3), semiporcelain/ironstone (n = 1),
ironstone (n = 5), stoneware (n = 3), and earthenware (n = 1). Identifiable sherds include six
pieces of tableware, two rim sherds, part of a
crock base, a jar/vessel fragment, and a vessel
fragment. Two pieces of tableware and one of
the rim sherds bear embossed designs. More
than 70 percent of the ceramics are white with
clear glazes; salt and alkaline glazes are also
represented.
Recovered metal artifacts include a strap
hinge, wire nails and nail fragments (n = 5), two
unidentifiable nail fragments, a fence staple, and
three unidentifiable metal fragments. A brick
fragment and a piece of plastic were recovered
at 20â30 cm in Test Unit 8. The pencil segment
was collected from 30 to about 40 cm in the same
test unit.
Over 60 percent of the historic artifacts
were recovered northeast of FM 1735 (36 of 59
artifacts). Most of that material was collected

from Test Unit 8. Artifacts were also recovered
from Shovel Tests 4 and 8 and Trench 22. The
functional categories and twentieth-century
ages represented by the artifacts recovered
from this part of the site suggest that most of
the material is derived from the adjacent house
and nearby outbuildings, which likely served
as the center for a larger agricultural complex
(see discussion of 41TT918 in Survey Area 3).
The 23 historic artifacts recovered southwest
of FM 1735 were widely dispersed across the
tested area, but 65 percent of these items were
recovered from trenches and test units located
closest to the highway, implying that some could
be highway-related trash.
As a whole, the historic materials, consisting of domestic debris and building and fencing
items, appear to relate mostly to occupation of
the farm at the east corner of the present site
boundary since at least the 1930s (see discussion of 41TT918 in Survey Area 3). Some other
materials, in particular, brown glass probably
representing beer bottles from Test Units 7
and 8 close to the existing highway right of
way, may be roadside trash. The only item that
could be early twentieth century or older is a
single solarized amethyst glass sherd in Test
Unit 8. The other artifacts are more in keeping
with the broad age range implied by the stilloccupied residence at the east edge of the site,
which was in place at least as early as 1935
and appears to have served as the center of a
larger agricultural complex through at least
the early 1960s.
Assessment and
Recommendations
Test excavations at 41TT896 revealed lowdensity scatters of prehistoric (4.8 artifacts/m2)
and historic (4.5 artifacts/m2) artifacts in thin
disturbed surface sediments. The majority of the
artifacts are within 30 cm of the modern surface.
The one feature identified is of historic age and
probably represents a surface disturbance or
erosional cut that was partially backfilled with
ironstone rocks and cobbles. The historic component, consisting of 59 artifacts along with the
single feature, relates to extended occupation of
the adjacent farm complex outside the project
area to the east, along with trash discard along
FM 1735. Because the main part of this complex
remains unrecorded outside the project area and
16

is not being assessed here, archival research to
document its associations was not done.
The prehistoric component, which was the
impetus for the test excavations, is represented
by 4 chipped stone tools and 48 pieces of lithic
debitage. No prehistoric cultural features, or
even burned rocks indicative of disturbed features, were found. The assemblage suggests
short-term, nonintensive use for a limited range
of activities. The recovery of Gary dart points
and the absence of prehistoric ceramics suggest
that the prehistoric assemblage dates to the
late part of the Late Archaic period, which is in
line with conclusions presented by OâKelly et al.
(2009:78, 85, 90).
Given its insubstantial nature, association
with farmstead activities centered outside the
project area, low integrity, and twentieth-century age, the historic component of 41TT896 does
not have the capacity to contribute important
information. The prehistoric component also
does not contain important information, based
on the lack of features, sparseness of artifacts,
lack of datable materials, low integrity, and
thinness of the surface sediments. Given these
characteristics, there is no potential for isolating
prehistoric occupations that could be interpreted
with any confidence. Hence, neither component
is eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places under Criterion D (36 CFR
60.4; 36 CFR 800.4, 5) or designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (13 TAC 26.2, 8).

of the surrounding property was cleared of trees
in the late 1960s and is currently utilized as
cattle pasture.
The irregular, roughly U-shaped site area
recorded by PBS&J encompasses ca. 7,000 m2
and has approximate maximum dimensions of
125 m east-west by 70 m north-south. The segments of the site within the current proposed
right of way are a narrow western lobe with
approximate maximum dimensions of 45x25 m
and a shorter, wider eastern lobe of 25x35 m.
The west lobe encompasses 900 m2, and the east
lobe covers 715 m2 (horizontal Area of Potential
Effects = 0.4 acres; all investigated). This acreage and the larger site area were on privately
owned property at the time of the testing investigations. Ownership of the FM 1000 right
of way corridor and the site areas within it had
been transferred to Titus County by the time
of the mechanical scraping. Project schematics
show the site will be impacted by cutting to a
maximum depth of 0.5 m in the eastern part of
the site and placement of up to 2 m of fill across
the western part as part of the approach to a
bridge over the Hart Creek floodplain.
Previous Work
Site 41TT906 was defined initially through
the excavation of 64 shovel tests within segments of the second and third alternate FM 1000
alignments (OâKelly et al. 2009:127â128). Prehistoric artifacts were recovered in 13 of those
tests, at depths ranging from the surface to
90 cm. Three of the positive tests were within the
current project area, but the remainder were to
the north. The shovel test assemblage consists
of 33 prehistoric artifacts, 3 burned rocks, and
35 fragments of rusted metal (the latter from 1
test). In addition, 2 tests contained carbon that
was judged to be of recent derivation (OâKelly
et al. 2009:130). A third test that contained
burned clay and charcoal was used to define
the south end of the western site lobe, but the
testing reported here determined that this too is
likely attributable to recent vegetation clearing
and burning.
Two backhoe trenches were excavated on
low rises within the site. Trench FM 1000-5 was
along the eastern edge of the site, north of the
intermittent drainage that trends across the
eastern site lobe (and north of the final FM 1000
alignment). Trench FM 1000-6 was in the

Setting
Site 41TT906 was recorded as a prehistoric
Caddo site during the PBS&J survey of the
second proposed FM 1000 alignment in 2008
(OâKelly et al. 2009). Most of it is outside the
proposed right of way, with only two arms extending southward into it (Figure 9). The site is
on a series of low rises at the east edge of the
Hart Creek floodplain, about 60 m east of the
Hart Creek relief channel and 400 m east of
Hart Creek itself. Area topography gradually
rises to the east and south from an average site
elevation of 305 ft (Figure 10). An entrenched,
intermittent, westward-flowing drainage and
shallower surface swales cross through the site
and close to it from the uplands to the east. Most

north boundary. A prehistoric ceramic sherd was
recovered from Trench FM 1000-5, and eight
prehistoric artifacts (ceramics, chipped stone,
and ground stone) and two burned rocks were
found in Trench FM 1000-6. The materials in

the trenches were found from 10 to 90 cm below
the surface.
The total 41TT906 prehistoric artifact assemblage includes 21 ceramic sherds, a quartzite
Perdiz point, 18 pieces of debitage, and 2 possible
ground stone fragments. Also identified were 5

burned rocks, 6 fragments of burned clay, and
2 bone fragments. Based on the characteristics
of the assemblage and the site location on the
margin of the Hart Creek floodplain, it was
suggested that the identified material likely
represented subsistence-related activities at
a seasonally occupied locality, with the Perdiz
point indicating Middle to Late Caddo occupation. More than 70 percent of the prehistoric
assemblage was found within 40 cm of the modern surface, and the Perdiz point and all of the
ceramics were recovered in the upper 50 cm.
The investigators suggested that the cultural
material found below 50 cm (primarily lithic
debitage) could indicate multiple occupations or
vertical displacement within the sediment column. PBS&J recommended that 41TT906 was
potentially eligible for inclusion in the National
Register and designation as a State Archeological Landmark and recommended testing for the
portion within the final FM 1000 alignment
(OâKelly et al. 2009:149â150).

from 5.9 to 11.0 m in length (average = 9.2 m).
Trenches 1â7 and 15 account for about 8 percent
of the area within and adjacent to the western
lobe, and Trenches 8â14 account for about
9 percent of the eastern lobe (13 percent of the
area south of the intermittent drainage). Trench
depths varied from 0.90 to 1.60 m, averaging
1.20 m (Table 3). Approximately 166 m3 of sediment was removed during trench excavation.
Trench 2 truncated PBS&J Trench FM 1000-6
and Shovel Test 35. The alignment of the trench
was such that the previous units were exposed in
opposite walls in the southern third of the new
trench. Barbed wire fences were erected around
the trenches areas to keep livestock out during
the field investigations.
Trench walls and floors were monitored for
artifacts, cultural features, and other anomalies
during mechanical excavation, and observed
artifacts were collected and retained for analysis. All of the trench side walls and some trench
ends were scraped and cleaned with shovels
and trowels. A Trench Excavation Record Form
was used to record trench dimensions, the presence/absence of artifacts and cultural deposits,
and other characteristics in each trench. In addition, the sediments exposed were described
and recorded, and sketches showing observed
strata across the length of one trench wall were
completed for all of the trenches. At least one
photograph was taken of the sediment column
in each trench, and 2-m-wide profiles were completed in Trenches 2, 7, and 11.
Once trench cleaning and recording were
completed, four 1x1-m test units were hand
excavated (see Figure 9). Test Unit 1 was placed
above two burned rocks visible in the east wall
of Trench 2. Test Units 2 and 3 were placed
along Trenches 5 and 9, respectively, because ceramic sherds were recovered from both trenches.
Trench 14 was randomly chosen for the placement of the fourth test unit.
A datum was set adjacent to the corner with
the highest surface elevation in each test unit,
and datum elevations were established with
the total station. The highest surface elevation
at each unit was used as the starting elevation
for unit excavation. Unit excavation typically
proceeded in 10-cm levels after removal of the
first level surpassed variation in surface slope.
The last 0.30 m of Test Unit 3 was removed in a
single level in an effort to reach the Bt horizon.
Excavation Record Forms were used to record

Methods of Investigation
Prior to testing, the right-of-way corridor
in the vicinity of 41TT906 was marked on the
ground to facilitate secure identification of the
limits of the project area. The proposed FM 1000
corridor and the 41TT906 site boundary were
uploaded onto a handheld Trimble GPS receiver
to establish the east and west edges of each site
lobe at the north right-of-way boundary, and the
southernmost extent of each lobe. A compass and
tape were used to set trench stakes according
to magnetic north in each lobe. Most trenches
were spaced about 5 to 10 m apart, but variations in trench spacing and alignments were
made according to localized surface topography
(low-lying areas were avoided when possible)
and trench position with respect to the site
boundary. Fifteen trenches were laid out within
or adjacent to the two parts of the site located
within the proposed final highway alignment
(15â20 trenches were proposed in the scope of
work). Eight were in the west lobe (Trenches 1â7
and 15), and 7 were set south of the channelized
drainage that cuts across the north edge of the
east lobe (Trenches 8â14).
Trench excavation was completed using
a backhoe fitted with a 0.9-m-wide toothless
bucket. A total of 137.3 linear meters of trenches
were excavated among 15 trenches that ranged

information on the test units. Completed units
were photographed.
Test Unit 1 was excavated as a full 1x1-m
unit to a depth of about 70 cm before unit size
was decreased to 1.0x0.50 m due to low artifact
recovery. Additional excavation continued into
the top of the Bt horizon, ending at a depth of
130 cm. Test Units 2 and 3 were excavated as
1x1-m units to depths of 50 cm before unit size
likewise was decreased due to minimal artifact
recovery. Further excavation in Test Unit 2
continued to the Bt horizon contact at a dept
of 100 cm. Additional excavation in Test Unit 3
proceeded to about 140 cm before excavation was
terminated due to no artifact recovery. The Bt
horizon was not exposed in that unit despite its
presence in the trench floor approximately 2 m to
the south. Test Unit 4 was excavated as a 1x1-m
unit to a depth of 60 cm before additional effort
was canceled due to no artifact recovery. The
Bt horizon was not exposed in that unit either.
These differences in the depth of the Bt horizon
suggest relict downcutting or channelization
derived from surface drainage off the adjacent
uplands, a process that is clearly at work today

in the channelized drainage that trends across
the site within meters of Test Unit 3.
A total of 3.25 m3 of sediment was excavated
between the four test units. This includes a little
more than 1.70 m3 in the west lobe and 1.50 m3
in the east lobe. Though the total volume is less
than the 5â6 m3 identified as the maximum in
the scope of work, the number of units excavated
is appropriate given the small sizes of the areas
investigated and the sparse archeological remains (the scope of work proposed three units
if no features were found). The level of effort
expended in testing this site (36 person-days) is
considered to represent a reasonable and goodfaith effort, given its size and contents. All of
the excavated sediment was screened through
1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth, and all artifacts
other than burned rocks were collected and
retained for analysis.
Subsequent to the testing, a policy change
enacted by the Texas Department of Transportationâs Environmental Affairs Division
necessitated mechanical scraping in portions
of 41TT906 located within the project area to
determine whether Native American burials
21

were present. This final phase of investigation
was conducted in July 2012 and included all of
the site area within the FM 1000 right of way
(see Figure 9). Prior to scraping, the FM 1000
corridor, the 41TT906 site boundary, and the
site map generated during testing were uploaded onto a handheld Trimble GPS receiver
to reestablish the locations of the east and west
site lobes. The Trimble and a metal detector
were used to re-locate the datum and backsight
used for total station mapping during testing.
The datum, backsight, and north right-of-way
boundary were marked with stakes. The previously excavated backhoe trenches were still
clearly visible, and these were used in conjunction with the redefined right-of-way boundary
to mark the limits of the east and west lobe
scrape areas.
Mechanical scraping was conducted with a
trackhoe fitted with a 1.5-m-wide, smooth-edged
bucket that removed sediment in 10â15-cm
levels. Scraping in each lobe started just south
of the north right-of-way boundary to preserve
solid ground for later fence installation. A total
of 1,864 m 2 of sediment were mechanically
stripped. The east lobe scrape included areas
north and south of the entrenched drainage and
encompassed a combined total of 760 m2, ranging
from 50 to 105 cm in depth due to variations in
surface elevations (Figure 11a). Including the
drainage, this block had approximate maximum
dimensions of 30 m north-south by 38 m eastwest. The west lobe scrape area had approximate
maximum dimensions of 50 m north-south by
32 m east-west, covered 1,104 m2, and ranged
from about 35 cm to 90 cm deep (Figure 11b).
Scrape area floors were monitored for
artifacts, cultural features, and other anomalies during stripping, and backdirt piles were
monitored for artifacts. The floors of both scrape
areas were cleaned with flat-bladed shovels to
identify soil disturbances. Most were immediately identifiable as previously excavated shovel
tests or infilled root tracks and stump voids.
Four anomalies were investigated by excavating
half of each to verify their derivation; all were
judged to be noncultural. The limits of each
scrape area were recorded with a total station,
and both areas were backfilled with a bulldozer
and trackhoe. The trackhoe also was used to
reconstruct the drainage that bisects the east
lobe. The mechanical scraping required about
24 person-days of effort.

The small artifact assemblage derived from
the testing and mechanical scraping was taken
to the Prewitt and Associates laboratory in
Austin. Laboratory processing consisted of washing, identifying, and cataloging the recovered
cultural materials. Given the small assemblage
size, artifact analysis was limited to classifying
specimens according to basic functional group
(ceramic, chipped stone, or ground stone) and
identifying styles or artifact types within each
group. Other basic characteristics such as ceramic temper and lithic material type were also
recorded. Recovered faunal bone was counted
and weighed. The assemblage was prepared for
curation according to the standards of the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin, where the artifacts
and all field records are curated.
Site Sediments
The sediments observed throughout the
excavated trenches are consistent with the
main soil mapped for this area, frequently
flooded Nahatche loam silty clay loam (Roberts
1990:43; U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 2012b). Disturbed surface sediments in the seven western
lobe trenches consisted of well- to moderately
sorted sandy silts, silty sands, and sandy loams
with some small hematitic gravels and varying
frequencies of charcoal derived from modern
vegetation clearing. The underlying sediments
are well-sorted fine-grained sands, silty sandy
loams, and sandy clay loams with redoximorphic
features (ferrous staining and ferromanganese
concretions) that increase in frequency with
depth. Root and rodent krotovina and infilled
vertic features are dispersed throughout these
sediments. Basal sandy clay was exposed in
all of the western lobe trenches except Trench
1. This zone is usually marbled with vertical
cracks infilled with pale gray sand (Figure 12).
The typical sequence documented in the western
lobe trenches includes an Ap horizon, multiple
Bg horizons, and a Bt horizon. The Ap horizon
was divided into two zones in Trenches 4 and
7 to account for variations in recent surface
disturbance, and a discontinuous remnant of
buried A horizon was identified in Trench 15.
Two Bg horizons were identified in Trenches

Trenches 2, 3, and 5.

Similar profiles were exposed in the seven
eastern lobe trenches, though upper and
middle sediments typically were much drier
in that part of the site (Figure 13). Surface
sediments there are well- to moderately sorted
fine-grained sands, sandy silts, silty sands, and
sandy loams with some small hematitic gravels.
Widely dispersed small charcoal fragments
were present in the topmost horizon in some
trenches. Minor carbonate stippling and manganese concretions were observed in Trench
12, and rare ferrous nodules were observed
in Trench 13. Middle sediments, consisting of
moderately to well-sorted fine-grained sands,
silty sands and sandy silts, sandy loams, and
sandy clay loams, exhibited the same redoximorphic features and disturbances identified
in the western lobe. The basal sediments in the
eastern lobe trenches are clay loam, sandy clay
loam, and sandy clay. A single Ap horizon was
recorded across all of the east lobe trenches.
Two Bg horizons were identified in Trenches
8 and 13, three were identified in Trenches
10â12 and 14, and four were identified between
Trench 9 and adjacent Test Unit 3.

Aerial photographs indicate that the site
area was cleared of tree cover between 1964
and 1983 (an account supported by a previous
landowner [Tom Joyner, personal communication 2011]), and clear evidence of tree felling
and burning was exposed in Trenches 4, 7, and
15, which were along the edges of a low-lying
swale that encompassed the southern third of
the western lobe. Later mechanical stripping
exposed extensive carbon deposits in this area as
well. The Ap horizon in Trench 15, the southern
third of Trench 4, and the southern and central
thirds of Trench 7 consisted of carbon-stained
sands and sandy silts mixed with variable
amounts of carbonized wood, along with fragments and coarse lenses of sediment derived
from the underlying zones. Much of the displaced
sediment exhibited varying degrees of oxidation,
and segments of the Ap-Bg1 horizon contact in
the southern portions of Trenches 7 and 15 were
also oxidized. Lenses and pockets of oxidized
sediment or sediment with high charcoal densities were typically found on or just above the
Ap-Bg1 horizon contact and were covered with
carbon-stained Ap horizon sediments. It appears

features and basal sandy clayey silt at the bottom.

that this is the area where PBS&J Shovel Test
45 recovered burned clay and charcoal, and thus
it is surmised that these remains represent
modern vegetation clearing as well. Coupled
with the lack of artifacts in Trenches 6, 7, and
15, this indicates that the actual site boundary is north of this area, conforming to slightly
elevated terrain surrounding the knoll that is
centered along the north edge of the proposed
FM 1000 alignment.

sherds, 13 pieces of debitage, the Yarbrough
point, the pitted stone, and all the burned rocks
and faunal remains are from Test Units 1â3 and
Feature 1 in Test Unit 1; the remainder of the
assemblage was recovered during mechanical
scraping. Three of the sherds, the untyped dart
point fragment, a flake, and a hammerstone are
from the eastern lobe, and the remainder of the
cultural materials are from the western lobe.
Trench 2 exposed two large burned rocks in
its east wall, and Test Unit 1 was positioned to
expose these rocks. This excavation identified
Feature 1, a disturbed burned rock concentration. Feature 1 was first exposed in the lower
portion of Level 3 (27â37 cm), and it was excavated concurrent with but independent of the
surrounding test unit from the top of Level
4. Feature 1 is a disturbed, C-shaped concentration of burned rocks bordering a mostly
rock-free area centered in the unitâs southwest
quadrant (Figure 14). In addition to originally
extending a short distance into Trench 2, the
scatter also went into the east half of the unitâs
south wall. The concentration was composed of
several large subangular and angular cobbles

Results of Investigations
Testing and mechanical scraping at 41TT906
exposed a burned rock feature and recovered 44
prehistoric artifacts, 10 faunal bone fragments,
and 5 small nonfeature burned rocks (Table 4).
The artifacts consist of 16 ceramic sherds, a
Dalton point, a Yarbrough dart point fragment,
an untyped dart point fragment, a unifacial tool,
19 pieces of debitage, a modified hematite fragment, 2 hammerstones, a pitted stone fragment,
and an indeterminate ground/battered stone
tool fragment. Three sherds and a hammerstone
were recovered from four backhoe trenches; 4

interspersed among numerous smaller clasts
that varied from subangular and tabular to
rounded and irregular in shape. Some of the
larger rocks clearly were fractured in situ.
Smaller clasts in the east half overlapped in
two layers. The exposed portion of the scatter
had maximum dimensions of 94 cm northsouth by 96 cm east-west and had minimum
and maximum depths below the surface of 34
and 46 cm. Feature thickness based on these
depths is misleading, however, since the average top and bottom depths for the entire burned
rock group are only 4 cm apart (37 and 41 cm).
The sediment surrounding the burned rocks
was identical to the nonfeature fill above and
outside of the concentration in Levels 3 and 4.
Although carbon flecks were widely dispersed
above Feature 1, no carbonized macrobotanical
material, carbon-stained or oxidized sediment,
or ash was observed during feature excavation, and no indication of an associated pit or
basin was discernible. Clast removal revealed
only three small rocks in the south wall of Test
Unit 1, which suggests that the feature did not
continue far to the south (an adjoining unit was
not opened for that reason).
The excavated portion of Feature 1 contained 16.4 kg of thermally altered rocks: 12.1 kg
of ferruginous sandstone, 2.2 kg of quartzite
(represented only by a large cobble and smaller
heat spall), 1.1 kg of hematite, and 1.0 kg of
silicified wood. One of the pieces of ferruginous
sandstone is a pitted stone. The only other
material specifically attributable to Feature 1
are 10 pieces of faunal bone found immediately

above and among the rocks, although 5 flakes
recovered above, adjacent to, and below the
concentration could be associated.
No Native American cultural features,
including burials, were found in the mechanical scraping, but this effort yielded almost half
the artifacts. These consist of nine prehistoric
ceramic sherds, two dart points, the unifacial
tool, six pieces of debitage, the modified hematite
fragment, a hammerstone, and the indeterminate ground/battered stone tool fragment.
Dalton points, which date to the late Paleoindian period, are characterized by parallel-sided
stems with grinding on the stem and basal
edges, deeply concave bases, basal thinning or
fluting, and beveled, often serrated blade edges
(Turner and Hester 1999:99). The Dalton point,
recovered in the north-central portion of the
west lobe scrape area, is complete except for the
extreme distal tip; it is 51.0 mm long, 21.9 mm
wide, and 6.9 mm thick (Figure 15a). The base
of this chalcedony specimen was thinned by
removal of a large flake on one face, and the
edges of the slightly expanding stem and concave
base are lightly ground. The triangular blade
is alternately beveled with weakly serrated
lateral edges.
The Yarbrough point, found below Feature
1 during testing, is a quartzite proximal-medial
fragment with straight to slightly convex blade
edges, slight shoulders, and a parallel to slightly
expanding stem (Figure 15b). The distal end was
detached by a bending fracture. This specimen is
41.3 mm long, 23.1 mm wide, and 10.5 mm thick.

Texas, are thought to date mostly to the Late
Archaic period (Dockall et al. 2008:21).
The untyped proximal-medial dart point
fragment was fashioned from nonlocal gray
banded chert that may be Edwards chert (Figure 15c). The blade edge remnants are straight,
exhibit bifacial pressure flaking, and are moderately serrated. The intact side of the base is
clearly corner notched with a distinct shoulder
barb. Stem margins are irregular, and its base is
flat to slightly convex. A platform remnant of the
original flake is evident at one corner of the stem,
and the ventral surface of the original flake is
evident on one face. Truncated by a bending
fracture, this specimen is 21.0 mm long, 23.8 mm
wide, and 6.2 mm thick. Although unidentifiable
to type, this fragment shows some morphological similarities to variants of the Cossatot type
described in Turner and Hester (1999:97), which
dates to the Early Archaic period.
A tabular piece of silicified wood exhibits
unifacial flake removal on its lateral margins
and distal end (Figure 15d). Polish is evident
on the ventral surface, and slight rounding is
visible along the distal edge of the same surface.
Morphology and wear suggest use as an end
scraper. This specimen is 83.6 mm long, has a
maximum width of 51.9 mm at the distal end,
and has a maximum thickness of 12.1 mm at
the proximal end.
The 19 pieces of debitage consist of 7 flakes
and 12 flake fragments. Ten are of local chert,
4 are of quartzite, 2 are silicified wood, and 1
specimen each is of rhyolite, hematite, and possible Edwards chert. Most reflect hard-hammer
reduction, but seven are soft-hammer flakes.
The rhyolite flake and the possible Edwards
chert flake fragment are bifacial thinning
flakes.
Variable smoothing on the cortical surface
of an otherwise angular hematite fragment
suggests it is derived from an axe preform.
Small, closely spaced incisions are present on
one segment of the smoothed exterior surface.
The hammerstone recovered during testing is
a tabular fragment of silicified wood that exhibits variable battering damage at both ends
and moderate to severe thermal discoloration.
The other hammerstone is a small, naturally
rounded cobble of dense ferruginous sandstone
with minor battering damage on its ends. The
pitted stone fragment from Feature 1 is a thermally fractured piece of ferruginous sandstone

with two ground pits on one facet remnant.
The indeterminate ground/battered stone tool
fragment is a piece of nonferruginous sandstone with percussion marks along its curved
margin and on two facet remnants. Battering
on the facet remnants created two small pits
about 1.0â1.5 cm in diameter that may have
been produced during bipolar percussion. Slight
smoothing is apparent on one facet, and light to
moderate thermal discoloration is evident.
The ceramics consist of 25 sherds and
crumbs that refit (or nearly so) to form 16
sherds. They range from 2.0 to 7.9 cm in maximum dimension; they are 7.2â9.4 mm thick,
averaging 7.7 mm. All have clayey pastes and
clearly are Caddo wares. Seven have both grog
and bone as temper, and 9 have just grog. One
is a rim with a single fingernail punctation
beneath a folded lip (Figure 16a); it appears to
be from an everted-rim jar. A single sherd is a
fragment of a flat base. The other 14 are body
sherds. Eight show no indications of decoration,
though with many being small it is impossible
to say they are from undecorated vessels. One
decorated body sherd has a single appliquÃ©
strip (probably vertical) with fingernail punctations on it (Figure 16b). The sherd cannot
be typed, but this treatment is common on
such Late Caddo types as Harleton AppliquÃ©
and Pease Brushed-Incised (Suhm and Jelks
1962:65â66, 119â120). A single large body sherd
has brushing that probably was oriented diagonally (Figure 16c); it cannot be typed, but this
treatment occurs on such Late Caddo types as
Bullard Brushed (Suhm and Jelks 1962:21â22).
A single body sherd has an engraved line with
a short engraved line dropping from it (Figure
16d); it cannot be typed. One body sherd has
two straight incised lines but is otherwise undistinctive. Two other sherds appear to have
one or two shallow incised or engraved lines,
but their surfaces are too eroded to be sure
(Figure 16e).
The 10 faunal elements from Feature 1
consist of 9 fragments of degraded cortical bone
and 1 small fragment of thinner flat bone. Some
exhibit light thermal discoloration, but indications of burning are unclear on most pieces. Most
were subjected to excavation and postexcavation
breaks, and the largest is only 1.5 cm in length.
They have a collective weight of 2.7 g.

Assessment and
Recommendations

within 30 cm of the modern surface, as were the
four sherds and three pieces of debitage in Test
Units 2 and 3; a single burned rock was found
deeper (88â98 cm) in Test Unit 2 (see Table 4).
Artifacts were found at greater depths in Test
Unit 1; six flakes were collected between 17 and
57 cm, and four flakes were found between 67
and 87 cm. The Yarbrough dart point fragment
was recovered at 52 cm, and the silicified wood
hammerstone from Trench 2 that was associated
with Feature 1 was found at about 40 cm. Four
small fragments of burned rock were observed
between 57 and 77 cm in Test Unit 1.
The vertical dispersal of artifacts in Test
Unit 1 may be due, at least in part, to the downward movement of artifacts in the sediment
column through bioturbation and pedogenic
processes. Both forms of disturbance were observed during the excavation of that unit. No
artifacts were recovered between 87 and 127 cm
in Test Unit 1.

Test excavations in two small parts of
41T906 revealed a disturbed prehistoric burned
rock feature and a sparse distribution of prehistoric artifacts (4.8 artifacts/m2). Artifact recovery
in the east site lobe was limited to 3 prehistoric
ceramic sherds, 1 dart point fragment, 1 flake,
and 1 hammerstone. The west lobe yielded 13
sherds, a Dalton dart point, a Yarbrough dart
point, a unifacial tool, 18 pieces of debitage, 4
ground/battered stone tools, 10 small fragments
of faunal bone, and more than 16.4 kg of burned
rocks. All of the sherds from the manual excavations and 40 percent of the lithic artifacts were
recovered within 30 cm of the modern surface.
Almost all of the prehistoric cultural material
located below 30 cm was in Trench 2 and Test
Unit 1, including the burned rock feature and
the Yarbrough point.

30

The ceramic sherds suggest that a light
Late Caddo component is present, probably
mostly outside the project area to the north.
The recovery of a Perdiz arrow point during
survey is consistent with this chronological assessment. The Yarbrough point fragment, and
probably the burned rock feature, are indicative of a Late Archaic component, which also is
probably more concentrated outside the project
area to the north. The Dalton point and perhaps
the untyped dart point fragment could relate
to much earlier occupations, or they may be
artifacts recycled by the Late Archaic or Caddo
occupants.
No component is represented by sufficient
archeological remains within the FM 1000 project area to permit interpretation. Further, while
some of the Archaic artifacts occur deeper in the
surface sands than at least some of the Late
Caddo artifacts, there is no evidence that the
materials from these different occupations could
be segregated from one another consistently
and with confidence. There is no stratigraphy to
facilitate isolation of components, and there is
evidence in the form of vertic pedogenic features
and ongoing bioturbation to suggest that the
vertical distribution of artifacts is a function of
disturbance rather than depositional processes.
Another factor contributing to the deposits having low integrity is clearing and burning of trees
in the late 1960s.
The investigated part of 41TT906 does not
contain important information because of the
scarceness of both features and artifacts, lack of
datable materials, low integrity, and inability to
isolate components with any confidence. Hence,
it is not eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places under Criterion D (36 CFR
60.4; 36 CFR 800.4, 5) or designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (13 TAC 26.2, 8).

for a bridge to span the low-lying floodplain between embankments located west of Hart Creek
and east of the Hart Creek relief channel. Thus
impacts will be shallow (1 m or less), except
where bridge piers will extend 7.6â12.2 m below
the surface. Previous PBS&J survey efforts on
the floodplain included excavation of numerous
shovel tests in the second and third alternate
FM 1000 alignments. Many of the shovel tests
excavated west of the main stream and east of
the secondary channel were within the proposed
final alignment, but most of the tests and two
backhoe trenches between the channels were
north of the final alignment and Survey Area 1
(Figure 17). Seven of the previously excavated
shovel tests were inside of the north edge of
the survey tract, and an eighth was at the west
end; none of these was positive for archeological
materials. However, a potential for archeological
materials in the survey area was indicated by
previous isolated surface and subsurface finds
in the floodplain north and south of the proposed
final alignment and by the presence of several
archeological sites east of the Hart Creek relief
channel. Consequently, TxDOT-ENV requested
that additional shovel testing be conducted.
Methods of Investigation and
Results
A Trimble GPS receiver containing the
proposed FM 1000 final alignment and the
limits of Survey Area 1 was used to position
and orient the field crew and to record the
locations of excavated shovel tests. Ten shovel
tests were placed along two transects through
the area (see Figure 17). The transects followed
the longitudinal axis and southern edge of the
3-acre parcel. Areas of higher topography were
targeted for shovel test excavation. The tests
were spaced such that 2 on each transect were
between Hart Creek and a small drainage that
trends across the central portion of the survey
area, and 3 were in the wider area between
the minor drainage and the Hart Creek relief
channel. No tests were placed along the west
bank of Hart Creek because PBS&J previously
excavated 3 tests in that area.
Shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm levels, and all removed sediment was screened
through 1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth or carefully sorted through with a trowel when too difficult to screen efficiently. The hardness of the

dry floodplain sediments hampered shovel test
excavation. The tests varied from 50 to 70 cm
deep, averaging 60 cm. The shovel test density is
3.3 per acre, which exceeds the Texas Historical
Commissionâs standards for archeological survey
for tracts of this size. Including the eight PBS&J
shovel tests, the density is 6.0 per acre.
Floodplain sediments encountered in
the shovel tests consisted of upper layers of
strongly granular silty clay, silty clay loam,
sandy silt, and silty sand that were typically
less than 10 cm thick. These sediments were
generally underlain by moderately to very wellconsolidated silty clays and clays with strongly

blocky structure. Underlying zones of silt or silt
loam were encountered in three tests. These
sediments contained minor percentages of finegrained sand and clay and varying densities of
ferromanganese staining starting roughly 50 cm
below the surface. Several tests contained layers
of dry compact sandy silt or clayey silt below
the thin uppermost zones; clay loads in these
secondary zones increased with depth. Widely
dispersed charcoal fragments were present in
the top 30 cm of two tests, and unburned tree
roots were encountered in another test. Gravels
were noticeably absent in the tested floodplain
sediments.

were excavated within the fenced yard of a ca.

were excavated in 20-cm levels, and all removed
sediment was screened through 1/4-inch-mesh
hardware cloth or carefully sorted through with
a trowel when too difficult to screen efficiently.
Shovel tests were 10â30 cm deep, averaging
22 cm, reflecting the shallow surface sediments
in this upland setting. The shovel test density
for the 7-acre tract is 3.0 per acre, which exceeds
the Texas Historical Commissionâs standards for
archeological survey for tracts of this size.
Sediments consistent with Freestone series
soils were identified in four tests on the west side
of the surveyed tract (Shovel Tests 11, 12, 25, and
possibly 13). The remaining tests (save for Shovel
Tests 15 and 28) exposed sediment profiles more
characteristic of Woodtell series soils. Sampled
surface sediments were composed of thin layers
of loosely to moderately consolidated, weakly to
strongly granular loams and sandy loams with
many roots. These sediments were typically less
than 10 cm thick and exhibited varying degrees
of disturbance derived from recent occupation
and past and present land use. The underlying sediments typically consisted of hard, very
well-consolidated loams and sandy loams with
variable redoximorphic features and varying
frequencies of hematitic gravels. The frequency
of redoximorphic concentrations and hematitic
gravels generally increased with depth. Zones
of very well-consolidated clay loam, sandy clay,
or clay were exposed from 6 to 20 cm below the
surface, but were typically first encountered at
the lower end of that depth range. Soil cracks
were visible at the surface in maintained pasture
across the survey tract.
Sediment profiles in most tests in the immediate vicinity of the 1920s house were similar
to those encountered across the rest of Survey
Area 2, but notable differences were encountered in two tests. A deposit of sand visible at
the surface across much of the yard in front of
the house (west and northwest of the structure)
likely represents imported fill used to level the
house pad, the front yard, or both. This layer
of sediment was 20 cm thick in Shovel Test 28.
An area of disturbed and possibly redeposited
sediment southwest of the yard fence was investigated with Shovel Test 15. The strongly
granular clay visible at the surface in this area

No archeological materials or deposits were
identified in the shovel tests in Survey Area 1.
The eight PBS&J shovel tests within this parcel were also negative. Based on these findings,
construction of FM 1000 in this area will not
affect any cultural resources that are eligible for
National Register listing or State Archeological
Landmark designation.
Survey Area 2
Description
Survey Area 2 encompasses a 7-acre, Tshaped parcel of proposed new right of way in
the uplands at the intersection of the proposed
FM 1000 final alignment and existing FM 2348
(see Figure 1). The survey area primarily consisted of maintained pasture utilized for hay
production and stock grazing and was privately
owned at the time of survey (Figure 18). The
T-shaped west end consists of approximately
205 m of the east edge of existing FM 2348 right
of way and varies from 10 to 15 m in width. The
west-east main part of the survey area is approximately 400 m long and ranges from a width
of ca. 110 m at its west end to 50 m at its east end
(horizontal Area of Potential Effects = 7 acres;
all investigated). Proposed cut sections on the
current design schematics indicate that road
construction impacts will extend to a maximum
depth of 1.5 m below the existing surface in this
tract. Thin fill sections are called for at the east
and west ends of the parcel. Prehistoric sites
were considered unlikely here because of the
upland setting; shallowly buried historic sites
were judged more likely.
Methods of Investigation and
Results
A Trimble GPS receiver containing the proposed FM 1000 final alignment and the limits
of Survey Area 2 was used to position and orient the field crew and to record the locations
of shovel tests. Twenty-one shovel tests were
excavated (see Figure 18). The west-east length
of the tract was investigated by the excavation
of 12 tests on two transects of 6 tests each. The
two survey transects were spaced approximately
20 m apart. Four additional tests were in the

extended to a depth of 8 cm below the surface in
that test. This material was mixed with peds of
the underlying stratum and moderate-density
charcoal fragments. The lower zone consisted
of a very well-consolidated clay loam with ferrous staining and concretions and low-density
hematitic gravels.
No prehistoric archeological materials were
found, and the 1920s house provided the only
hint that a historic site could be present. The
house is within a fenced yard with approximate
dimensions of 40 m northwest-southeast by 30 m
northeast-southwest (see Figure 18). The fence
consists of T-posts, a small number of wooden
corner posts, goat wire, and a single top strand
of barbed wire. The fenced area opens onto a
raised gravel driveway that trends northeast to
southwest behind the house. The drive is now
rarely used and is covered with pasture grass.
A modern aluminum shed is at the southeast
corner of the fenced area.
The house is a bungalow that is representative of an architectural style that dominated
early-twentieth-century residential construction
in rural settings in this region. With contributions from the Arts and Crafts movement,
rural bungalows typically have a cottage-like
appearance with a low-pitched front-gable, sidegable, or pyramidal roof and wide overhanging
eaves (Jakle et al. 1989:170â172; McAlester
and McAlester 2000:452â453). The dominant
style from the early twentieth century through
World War II, the Craftsman designâs popularity
proliferated through widely distributed pattern
books and magazines. In execution, the style was
most frequently applied to the bungalow form.
This was the most widely mass-produced house
type in the United States. In Texas, various
renditions of the form and myriad versions of
stylized ornamentation were popular for about
40 years.
The bungalow has a side-gabled roof and a
rectangular footprint with paired double-hung
windows and overhanging eaves. The upper
sashes in most of the windows feature nine
lights. The eyebrow hood porch entrance and
multilight panel door with a dentilated cornice
are also indicative of the bungalow form with
Craftsman influence (Figure 19a). The structureâs long axis is oriented northeast-southwest,
with the front entry facing northwest. Concrete
steps likely associated with the back door were
removed and left north of a fenced yard to make

way for a large covered porch off the back of
the house (Figure 19b). The porch and house
roofs are covered with asphalt shingles, and the
bungalowâs original siding was replaced with
vinyl siding (the same covers the gable end of
the porch). The modern siding, asphalt shingles,
storm windows and doors, and large back porch
are recent additions.
The bungalow and surrounding yard were
treated as a historic site at the time of the survey,
and several structures south of Survey Area 2
outside the proposed FM 1000 right of way were
photographed and visually inspected due to their
potential association with the house. However,
sand visible at the surface across much of the
yard in front of the bungalow suggested that fill
had been imported fairly recently to level the
house pad, front yard, or both, and subsequent
archival research and testimony provided by
family members of the property owners verified
that the house is not original to this location.
Aerial photographs from 1930, 1949, and 1963
provide a general timeline for the appearance
of the various extant structures and structure
footprints in the vicinity of Survey Area 2 (Tobin
International, Ltd. 1930; U.S. Army Map Service
1949; U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service
1963). However, none of these images shows a
structure where the bungalow is now located,
indicating that it was moved to that location
after 1963. Deed records indicate that Nellie D.
Clark purchased the property in 1975. Clark
family members noted that the bungalow was
moved to its present location from Mount Pleasant, but they did not know when this occurred,
which suggests that the house was moved there
between 1963 and 1975. According to family
members, the house was stripped down to its
structural frame and renovated in 1995. The
lack of historic artifacts in the seven shovel tests
near the house provides additional evidence that
a historic archeological component is not present. The 21 shovel tests in Survey Area 2 yielded
only an aluminum pull-tab (Shovel Test 14) and
asphalt fragments (Shovel Test 25).
Recommendation
No archeological materials or deposits were
identified in Survey Area 2, and the extant house
there is not eligible for listing in the National
Register because it does not possess integrity

identified on a hill about 120 m northwest of
41TT896. All tests were excavated in 20-cm
levels, and all removed sediment was screened
through 1/4-inch-mesh hardware cloth or carefully sorted through with a trowel when too
difficult to screen efficiently. The shovel test
density for the 2.8 acres outside 41TT896 is 6.8
per acre, well exceeding the Texas Historical
Commissionâs standards for archeological survey
on tracts of this size.
Shovel tests varied from 30 to 100 cm deep,
averaging 56 cm. Sediments encountered in
all but 2 of the 14 tests northwest of 41TT896
included upper layers of sand, silty sand, and
sandy loam that ranged from 15 to 65 cm thick.
The single horizon of sand exposed to a depth
of 50 cm in Shovel Test 15 contained tabular
ironstone rocks throughout the excavated profile. The sediment column exposed to a depth of
100 cm in Shovel Test 19 was a single unit of
sand mixed with occasional fine gravels. Secondary and tertiary zones of sand and silty sand
were noted in 4 tests. Basal layers were typically composed of silty clay and clay. Abundant
gravels were noted in basal sediments in Shovel
Tests 14, 16, and 18 in an elevated portion of the
survey area The sediments in Shovel Tests 12,
14, 16, and 18 are consistent with the characteristics of the unit of Kirvin gravelly fine sandy
loam that is mapped across the most elevated
portion of Survey Area 3 (Roberts 1990:38, 39,
Map Sheet 38; U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources Conservation Service 2012b).
The sediment profiles in other tests on this elevated area (Shovel Tests 4, 13, 15, and 17) and
in Shovel Test 19 to the southeast are characterized by much deeper surface sands.
The five tests southeast of 41TT896 were
shallower than those northwest of the site.
Sediments typically consisted of upper layers
of sand and silty sand that varied from 28 to
40 cm thick. Mottling was infrequent, and in
some instances, clay increased with depth. Basal
sediments consisted of silty clay and clay. The
sediment profile in the deepest of the tests in
this area (Shovel Test 7) consisted of upper and
lower layers of silty sand. Saturated sediments
prevented exposure of basal clay in this test.
Survey of Area 3 identified one historic site
and no prehistoric materials. The historic site,
41TT918, is approximately 120 m northwest of
41TT896 on the side slope of a small oval ridge
in an upland setting dissected by intermittent

Survey Area 3
Description
Survey Area 3 consists of a ca. 3-acre segment of proposed new right of way on the
northeast side of existing FM 1735 right of
way at the east terminus of the project corridor (see Figure 1). Survey was required in this
area because shovel tests were not excavated
in that segment of new right of way during the
previous PBS&J survey. This narrow section
abuts both the northwest and southeast sides of
41TT896 and thus was considered to have some
potential for shallowly buried prehistoric and
historic sites (Figure 20). The area is 630 m long
(excluding the 110-m segment considered part
of 41TT896) and has an average width of 18 m
(horizontal Area of Potential Effects = 2.8 acres;
all investigated). Although project schematics do
not depict this portion of the project area, design
details for the east terminus of FM 1000 and
for proposed modifications of FM 1735 suggest
that construction impacts will be 1 m or less
deep. Survey Area 3 included portions of two
privately owned tracts at the time of the field
investigation, with two residential properties at
its northwest end and part of another at the east
corner of 41TT896. Most is maintained pasture
used for cattle grazing.
Methods of Investigation and
Results
A Trimble GPS receiver containing the
proposed FM 1000 final alignment and the
limits of Survey Area 3 was used to identify
the boundaries of the survey area and to record
the locations of shovel tests. Initially, 11 shovel
tests were placed in that portion of the survey
area not overlapped by 41TT896 (6 northwest
and 5 southeast of 41TT896), being careful to
avoid a buried water line set approximately
2â3 m outside the existing right-of-way fence.
The recovery of historic-age artifacts in Shovel
Test 4 prompted the excavation of 8 additional
tests to define the limits of historic site 41TT918

drainages (see Figure 20). A modern residence
now occupies the top of that ridge northeast of
the site. The site is centered on a topographic
high that falls gently into a low-lying area on the
southeast and more rapidly toward a tributary
northwest of the site, with the overall slope of
the landform being to the southwest. Site surface
elevations range from about 435 to 445 ft. The
recorded site area has approximate maximum
dimensions of 55 m northwest-southeast by
30 m northeast-southwest, with the site probably extending northeast outside the project
area. A property fence trends across the central
portion of the site, and a tree is centered in the
site area immediately northwest of the fence.
The southeast half of 41TT918 is in maintained
cattle pasture covered with short grasses and
forbs. Daffodils are common across this part of
the site. The northwest half is in the yard of the
house to the north, with a concrete driveway
cutting across it (Figure 21).
Site 41TT918 was indicated by the presence
of historic artifacts on the surface and the recovery of historic artifacts in Shovel Tests 4, 12,
13, 15, and 17. The other three tests in the immediate area lacked artifacts. Although ground
surface visibility typically was 5 percent or less,
surveyors did observe pieces of glass, historic
ceramic sherds, wire nails, and fragments of
wire and indeterminate metal on the surface.
Partially burned lumber, fence posts, saw-cut
tree branches, and segments of barbed wire
were in a 5â7-m-diameter area in the central
part of the siteâs southeast half. No footings or
foundations were observed to indicate former
structure locations, and the burned materials,
which were just visible above the vegetation,
may be recent additions unrelated to the other
historic materials at this location.
The artifact sample recovered in five positive shovel tests consists of 17 pieces of glass,
3 historic ceramic sherds, 12 metal artifacts,
3 conjoinable fragments of possible brick or
plaster, a small thin piece of slate, a piece of
modern plastic, and a small quartzite flake
(Table 5). The morphology of the latter suggests
that it was produced during the excavation of
Shovel Test 13, and it is not considered to be
of prehistoric origin. The glass assemblage is
mostly clear glass (n = 14) but also includes 2
pieces of clear glass with a greenish tint and
1 piece of solarized amethyst glass. The latter
is a basal vase or tableware fragment. Some

of the other glass fragments are identifiable
as vessel (n = 6) and bottle (n = 3) fragments.
The remaining pieces are identifiable only as a
curved piece of automobile glass and pieces of
curved (n = 3) and flat (n = 3) glass. One of the
bottle fragments is broadly attributable to the
1920s or later, and the piece of solarized glass
is datable to the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. The ceramic artifacts include a
highly vitrified piece of semiporcelain/ironstone
and a basal fragment from a shallow ironstone
dish. Both are white with clear glaze. The third
ceramic artifact is a poorly vitrified earthenware pipe fragment with a glazed interior and
exterior. Metal artifacts include a cut nail, 5
wire nails, a large wire nail fragment, a large
bolt, and a segment of barbed wire. Single indeterminate fragments of wire, iron, and flat
metal were also recovered. Although 1 piece
of glass was recovered at 40â60 cm in Shovel
Test 4, the bulk of this assemblage was recovered within 20 cm of the modern surface (29 of
38 artifacts). Eight other items were found at
20â40 cm. Given natural disturbance (rodent
activity) and the amount of human-derived
disturbance that can be inferred from surface
observations and review of historic aerial photographs, it is not surprising that some of the
assemblage was recovered below 20 cm.
A large structure and one small structure
are visible in the site location on a 1935 aerial
photograph (Figure 22a; Tobin International,
Ltd. 1935). These structures may not reflect a
domestic locus, since no driveway linked them to
the roadway just to the southwest, and other attributes common to residential occupancy (such
as trees or other landscaping) appear not to have
been present. On the other hand, the presence of
some domestic artifacts implies that a house may
have stood here. Either way, these structures appear to have been an outlying part of a much
larger farm complex that was centered 220 m to
the southeast along FM 1735, where an occupied
residence, barn, and several other outbuildings
still stand at the east corner of 41TT896. A twotrack road is clearly visible between that set of
buildings and the structures that once stood at
41TT918 (see Figure 22a). Based on these relationships, the presence of agricultural fields just
north and west of 41TT918, and the size of the
larger structure there (approximately 24x20 ft),
41TT918 may have contained a pole barn or shed
with smaller ancillary structure that supported

Neither set of structures appears to be present on the 1909 soils map for Titus County (U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Field Operations
Bureau of Soils 1909), suggesting that the farm
complex was established in the 1910sâearly
1930s. In 1963, the main farm complex was still

in operation, but the structures at 41TT918 were
gone (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service
1963). Instead, two linear features 40â45 m
long, spaced roughly 25 m apart, and oriented
perpendicular to adjacent FM 1735 are visible
on the 1963 aerial, with one passing through
the northern part of 41TT918 and the other just

and near-surface scatter of twentieth-century
cultural debris primarily composed of building
and fencing materials and domestic/utilitarian
artifacts. It is unclear if the structures represent
farm outbuildings or a tenant or workerâs house,
but it is certain they were an outlying part of a
large farm complex centered over 200 m away
to the southeast. Because the main part of this
complex remains unrecorded outside the project
area and is not being assessed here, archival
research to document its associations was not
done. Because 41TT918 is a minor component
of a much larger complex, dates entirely to the
twentieth century, and retains no integrity,
it lacks the capacity to contribute important
information and is ineligible for listing in the
National Register (36 CFR 60.4; 36 CFR 800.4,
5) and designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (13 TAC 26.2, 8).
No archeological remains other than
41TT918 were found in Survey Area 3. The
southwest edge of the large farm complex that

north of the site (Figure 22b). Ghosts of both
features are visible on a 2010 aerial photograph
and in recent photographs of the site area (U.S.
Department of Agriculture, National Agriculture
Imagery Program 2010). Shadow orientation on
the 1963 aerial and the fact that traces of these
features are still visible today suggest that they
are derived from cuts into the ground surface.
Although these features cannot be interpreted
based solely on the 1963 aerial, their location
and orientation with respect to FM 1735 suggest
that they might have been silage pits that have
since been filled in. Whatever they were, clearing associated with their excavation apparently
removed most traces of the structures that stood
there before.
Recommendations
Although two structures were present at
41TT918 by 1935, these structures were removed
by 1963, and the site now consists of a surface

the project area and is not being assessed here,
archival research to document its associations
was not done.
Given its insubstantial nature, association
with farmstead activities centered outside the
project area, low integrity, and twentieth-century age, the historic component of 41TT896 does
not have the capacity to contribute important
information. The prehistoric component also
does not contain important information, based
on the lack of features, sparseness of artifacts,
lack of datable materials, low integrity, and
thinness of the surface sediments. Given these
characteristics, there is no potential for isolating
prehistoric occupations that could be interpreted
with any confidence. Hence, neither component
is eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places under Criterion D (36 CFR
60.4; 36 CFR 800.4, 5) or designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (13 TAC 26.2, 8).
Test excavations and mechanical scraping
at 41T906 revealed a disturbed prehistoric
burned rock feature and a sparse distribution of
prehistoric artifacts (n = 44) representing occupations during the Late Caddo and Late Archaic
periods; most of the site apparently lies outside
the project area to the north. Two dart points
recovered during scraping may indicate earlier
occupations as well, or they may be recycled
artifacts. No component is represented by sufficient archeological remains within the FM 1000
project area to permit interpretation. Further,
there is no evidence that the materials from the
different occupations could be segregated from
one another consistently and with confidence,
and various disturbance factors, including clearing and burning of trees in the late 1960s, have
diminished the integrity of the deposits. The
investigated part of 41TT906 does not contain
important information because of the scarceness
of both features and artifacts, lack of datable
materials, low integrity, and inability to isolate
components with any confidence. Hence, it is
not eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places under Criterion D (36 CFR
60.4; 36 CFR 800.4, 5) or designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (13 TAC 26.2, 8).
No archeological materials or deposits were
identified in either Survey Areas 1 or 2, and the
extant house in Survey Area 2 is not eligible
for listing in the National Register because it
does not possess integrity of place or materials, having been moved onto the property in

Summary and conclusions
In JulyâAugust 2011 and JanuaryâFebruary
2012, personnel with Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., performed test excavations at archeological
sites 41TT896 and 41TT906 and archeological
survey of two ca. 3-acre parcels and a ca. 7-acre
parcel in Titus County, Texas. Additional work
in the form of mechanical scraping was done
at 41TT906 in July 2012. All of this work was
done for Titus County under a contract with
PTP Transportation, LLC, and Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5998 in response to the planned
realignment of the FM 1000 corridor. Sites
41TT896 and 41TT906 had been identified during a previous survey for the project (OâKelly
et al. 2009) but needed additional investigation to determine if they are eligible for listing
in the National Register of Historic Places or
designation as State Archeological Landmarks.
The three parcels surveyed needed investigation
because parts or all of them were not included
in the previous intensive archeological survey.
Testing involved backhoe trenching, trackhoe
scraping, and manual excavation of test units
and shovel tests, and survey involved pedestrian
transects and shovel testing. All artifacts and
records generated by this project are curated at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at
the University of Texas at Austin.
Test excavations at 41TT896 revealed lowdensity scatters of prehistoric (n = 52) and historic (n = 59) artifacts in thin disturbed surface
sediments. The prehistoric assemblage suggests
short-term, nonintensive use for a limited
range of activities sometime during the Late
Archaic period. The one feature identified is of
historic age and probably represents a surface
disturbance or erosional cut that was partially
backfilled with ironstone rocks and cobbles.
The historic component relates to extended occupation of an adjacent farm complex outside
the project area to the east, along with trash
discard along FM 1735. Because the main part
of this complex remains unrecorded outside
43

the 1960sâ1970s and subsequently remodeled
extensively. The single site identified in Survey Area 3, historic site 41TT918, is a surface
and near-surface scatter of twentieth-century
cultural debris representing outbuildings or a
tenant or workerâs house associated with a large
farm complex centered over 200 m away to the
southeast. Because the main part of this complex
remains unrecorded outside the project area and

is not being assessed here, archival research to
document its associations was not done. Dating
entirely to the twentieth century, retaining no integrity, and being a minor component of a much
larger complex, 41TT918 lacks the capacity to
contribute important information and is ineligible for listing in the National Register (36 CFR
60.4; 36 CFR 800.4, 5) and designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (13 TAC 26.2, 8).
