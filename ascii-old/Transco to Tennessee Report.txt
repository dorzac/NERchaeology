A Cultural Resources Survey of the 40-Mile
Transco to Tennessee Segment of the
TEAK Residue Pipeline in Bee and Refugio
Counties, Texas

Abstract
Flatrock Enginering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources linear survey of 40 miles
of the TEAK Residue, Transco to Tennessee Segment right-of-way in southern Bee and northern
Refugio counties, Texas. Tierras Antiguas conducted a pedestrian survey with limited shovel
testing of moderate and high probability areas over several days during May through July, 2012,
resulting in the discovery of one prehistoric lithic scatter and open campsite (41BE25). The site
was assessed as very shallowly buried and otherwise heavily disturbed.
As such, Tierras Antiguas recommended that construction of the Transco to Tennessee Segment
of the TEAK Residue Pipeline should be allowed to proceed as currently designed. The project
should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered as eligible for
nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State Archeological
Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be allowed to proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined and evaluated
by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.
The project is entirely privately funded and the properties across which the pipeline will cross are
privately owned. No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

Introduction
TEAK Midstream Services Limited
Partnership of San Antonio, Texas is the
lead agency for the 40-mile Transco to
Tennessee Pipeline that is proposed for
construction. TEAK Midstream
contracted with Flatrock Engineering
and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio
to ensure the requirements for
environmental and cultural assessments
would be conducted in a professional
compliance manner.
At the request of Flatrock, Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations
(TAAI) conducted a cultural resources Figure 1. Location of the Project Area in Texas.

survey of the Project Area (PA) over several days in May through July, 2012 (Figures 1 and 2).
The project is privately funded, and the properties across which the pipeline will be constructed
are privately owned. The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). Because of the 40-mile length
of this pipeline, it is necessary to illustrate its entirety in six segments. These are shown on
topographic maps in Figures 3-8. These show previous archaeological surveys and known
archaeological sites within one mile of the proposed Transco to Tennessee Pipeline.

Modern Environmental Setting
Climate, Vegetation, Hydrology
Bee and Refugio counties are located in the Rio Grande Plain of south central Texas (see Figure
1). Their current political boundaries encompass 1,637 square miles. The generally flat to rolling
terrain ranges in elevation from sea level to about 300 feet above mean sea level. Clayey and
loamy alkaline soils support the growth of predominately open grasslands, with scattered
mesquite, huisache, post oak, live oak, and pecan, along with assorted shrubs and cacti.
Within their subtropical and humid environment, the counties are generally frost-free from lateFebruary through early December, allowing for about 275-280 growing season days. The average
annual rainfall is about 30 inches, with most rainfall occurring in May and September. These
peaks are the result of thunderstorms bearing moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the east, with
hurricanes most likely to occur during the summer months. Blanco, Medio, and Aransas creeks
are the major southeasterly trending streams draining Bee County, while the Guadalupe, San
Antonio, and Mission rivers, and Copano and Willow creeks drain through Refugio County.
Many drainages intermittently flow into these streams during seasonal periods of abundant
rainfall (Bauer 1996; Leffler 1996).

Flora and Fauna
The project area lies
within the Interior
Coastal Plains region,
and the flora of this area
has been classified as
being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic
province extending out
from northeast Mexico
(Figures 9 and 10). This
is the only part of Texas
where some vegetation
exhibits growth
throughout the year
(Blair 1950). Thorny
brush is the dominant
vegetation today, but this
is a relatively recent
occurrence, with a mix of
woody and grassland
species providing a
savanna environment
during prehistoric times
(Black 1989; Hester
1980; Inglis 1964).
The original vegetation
was an open grassland
mixed with brushy Figure 9. Physiographic regions of Texas
chaparral. Oaks, pecan, (http://www.lib.utexas.edu/geo/pics/txphysio.jpg)
and ash were common
along perennial streams. Due in part to overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, the invasion of
woody species has changed the vegetation into “Texas brush country” dominated by mesquite,
acacia, spiny hackberry, brazil, whitebrush, lotebrush, and others (Diamond et al. 1987:203-221).
On sandy soils, the brush includes mesquite with mixed grasses. In contrast, clay soils support
mesquite (Proposis juliflora), various species of Acacia, and mimosa, granjeno or desert
hackberry (Celtis pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera angustifolia, lindheeimeri), tasajillo (Opuntia
leptocaulis), and species of Condalia and Castela (Blair 1950).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south
Texas is as varied as the
landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains
significant gaps primarily due to
the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated
deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland
1995:51). To date, the best
record of paleoenvironmental
reconstruction in South Texas
has been accomplished by
Robinson (1982) from analysis
of phytoliths from three
archaeological sites in Live Oak
County. Overall, the data there
along with data from other sites
in Texas suggest that the waning
of the Pleistocene, or late-glacial
period, marked a transition from Figure 10. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.
a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew warmer and drier, and cenizo
(Leucophyllum texanum), white brush (Aloysia texana), prickly pear (Opuntia) more seasonal,
with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years ago. Most researchers then generally
agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was much warmer and drier than today.
Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the
present time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Soils
There are 28 different soil types within the Project Area that offer varying depths, resulting from
in situ soil formation, as well as colluvial and alluvial processes. As such, these various soil
classifications likewise imply the potential for the preservation of intact cultural resources to exist
(Guckian 1981, 1984; Websoil Survey 2012). Table 1 provides a brief description of these soils,
as well as a prediction of their ability to contain deeply buried, intact, and soil maps are shown
in Figures 11 - 16.

Cultural Context and Chronology
The Project Area lies along the cusp of both the South Texas archaeological region as defined by
Hester (1980, 1995, 2004), and the Central Texas Coast archaeological region as refined by
Ricklis (2004). All dates are given as approximate years before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.

South Texas
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is problematic, due to the compressed nature of
the archaeological record and the scarcity of stratified sites excavated within the region. Hester
(1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of information that exists for south Texas and as such offers
only a “general framework” for prehistoric periods particular to the region (Figure 17). This
period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of Clovis-

13

type points across most of North
America and even into Central
America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the
people who made them. Other
artifacts associated with the
Clovis culture include bifaces
and prismatic blades, engraved
stones, bone and ivory points,
stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners. During the late
Paleoindian interval, the first
stemmed lanceolate points, such
as Angostura, Golondrina, St.
Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among
a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian
adaptation has been considered
to be one of small bands of
nomadic, big-game hunters
following herds of Late
Pleistocene fauna, including
mammoth, mastodons, bison,
camel, and horse, across North
America (Black 1989). More
recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of
plants and animals used for
subsistence by these early
Americans, such as turtles and
tortoises, alligators, mice,
badgers, and raccoons, although
they undoubtedly hunted the
large animals as well (Collins
1995:381). Known Clovis sites
include killsites, quarries,
caches, open campsites, ritual
sites, and burials (Hester
1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis.
Folsom artifacts are fairly
common in south Texas;
Figure 17. South Texas Archaeological region chronology.
however, no campsites or
killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar County
14

(Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface lithic
scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was
necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as deer,
fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock
cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups
were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly
distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including most
of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low during
the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few
constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization of a
wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as
well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population,
based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). On the
South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear
continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. Weir (1976)
believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce,
at least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of
gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned
rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). The common
presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took
place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward less
mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest ccurrences dating to the south Texas
Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750
B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).

15

Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P.
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1993) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period
during the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is
represented by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap
the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this
marked a transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and
bison, and a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw
1985; Peter 1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not
disappear and sites were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
16

bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a nonstandard
manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the ones that best
suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core reduction and
the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology is a continentwide phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah assemblages in
Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans were
rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
17

1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

Central Texas Coast
Paleoindian (11,000 - 7500 B.P.)
Although some Paleoindian artifacts have been found, no intact paleoindian components have
been found in the Central Texas Coast region, so that a chronology of the Paleoindian period or
stage cannot be adequately defined (Hester 1980; Ricklis 2004). Exasterbating the discovery of
intact components is due in part to the rising sea level along the coast since Paleoindian campsites
were occupied; those campsites are presumably under water, far east of today’s shoreline. Ricklis
surmises that if buried and intact Paleoindian components are discovered, they will be in today’s
riverine environments away from the modern Gulf of Mexico shoreline.
Early Archaic (7500 - 4200 B.P.)
Two sub-periods are recognized during the 3,300-year Early Archaic period along the Central
Texas Coast. The earlier sub-period ranges from about 7500 to 6800 B.P., and is based upon
radiocarbon dates from shoreline archaeological sites in the Nueces Bay area. Sites during this
period are predominantly oyster shell middens situated on upland margins overlooking the bay.
These middens are the result of exploitation of oysters as a food source, but more often than not
few artifacts have been found. Those chipped stone pieces that have been found resemble Central
and South Texas, Uvalde and Gower dart points. Worked shell pieces include flaked sunray venus
clamshell scrapers and knives. Faunal remains are mostly non-existant at these sites, but that
could be due to the relative rapid disintegration of bone in the silty soils. Otherwise, only a few
of the more resiliant fish otoloiths have been found, suggesting that the occupants of the shoreline
at this time relied heavily on shellfish as their primary food source.
A valid archaeological record for the next circa 1,000 years is largely unknown. However, the
later sub-period of Early Archaic shoreline occupation sites date to around 5800-4200 B.P.
Ricklis sites radiocarbon data from 15 site components dating to this period. Cultural
manifestations during this sub-period are primarily oyster shell lenses, with occasional fish
otoloiths and chert flakes. However, one site (41NU221 - McKinzie Site) yielded a relatively
thick shell midden, along with hundreds of chert flakes, two Bell points, a Tortugas point, and
two modified shells. Triangular dart points have also been found on the surface at the Maens Site
(41NU184) in Nueces County. Potential evidence of an Early Archaic structure in the form of
post molds were also documented at 41NU184 (Ricklis and Gunter 1986). Although animal
bones are not generally found at these sites, the presence of chipped stone dart points and scrapers
18

suggest that hunting must have been very much a part of the subsistence base. Seasonally, data
retrieved from oyster shells and fish otoliths indicate that shellfish were most likely exploited in
the winter through early spring, and fish were trapped or caught in the fall and early spring.
Although Ricklis (2004) surmises that based upon the number of sites discovered, human
populations may have increased during this later sub-period, he cautions that the number of sites
that could have existed during the earlier sub-period may well have been destroyed and removed
by a dynamically eroding landscape.
Middle Archaic (4200 - 3100 B.P.)
This period is poorly dated, and may reflect a hiatus in Gulf shoreline occupation between 4200
and 3100 B.P. Ricklis (2004) opines that the numerous midden shell deposits that were present
during the Early Archaic and Late Archic, are either absent during the Middle Archaic, or are
most certainly few in number. Environmentally, the relative absence could be attributed to a rapid
sea level rise and highstand during the Middle Archaic. Much more effort needs to be exerted to
find and research Middle Archaic components before this period can begin to be more clearly
understood.
Late Archaic (3100 - 950 B.P.)
Roughly 3,000 years ago, the sea level in the Gulf of Mexico stabilized to what we see it today.
Much like Central Texas, the archaeological sites along the Central Texas Gulf Coast are larger
than during the Early Archaic, the middens at these sites are thicker, and there are a relatively
wider variety of tools being were being produced and utilized. These data strongly suggest that
populations increased significantly, and sites were likely occupied for longer periods of time.
Concurrent with the stabilized shoreline, and in effect the biotic production offered in coastal
estuaries, gathering shellfish became a very important food source, but supplemented with fish
and white-tailed deer. Around the middle of the Late Archaic, ca. 2,000 years ago, fishing became
very much an important part of the subsistence base. One of the more important Late Archaic
archaeological sites investigated is the Kent-Crane site (41AS3). It is situated on a shoreline bluff
above Copano Bay, was likely occupied as early as about 2,700 years ago, and extends for
roughly 1,000 meters along the bluff. The intensive occupation at Kent-Crane is manifested by
a sea shell midden as much as 1.8-meters thick.
A second significant archaeological site in the Central Texas Gulf Coastal area that represents
a Late Archaic occupation period is the Mustang Lake site (41CL3). Once again, this site was
occupied during a period of apparent sea level stabilization very similar to today’s level. The first
occupations at the Mustang Lake site appear to be temporally co-eval with those at the KentCrane site. Once again, there are dense layers of oyster shells, along with bone, and chipped
stone. In the upper-most portion of these midden layers, archaeologists found sandy-paste pottery
sherds. Other significantly important Central Texas Gulf Coastal, Late Archaic sites investigated
at Ingleside Cove on the northeastern shore of Corpus Christi Bay include 41SP43 and 41SP120.
Late Prehistoric (950 - 250 B.P. [A.D. 1000 - 1700])
Along the Central Texas Coast area, a marked change in stone tools, the transition from the
shoulder-thrown atlatl to the bow and arrow as a more accurate and deadly killing weapon, and
the production of clay vessels for storage and cooking occurred around 950 B.P. (A.D. 100019

1700). Ricklis (2004) divides the Central Texas Coast Late Prehistoric period into two subperiods, the Initial Late Prehistoric and the Final Late Prehistoric.
Initial Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1000-1250/1300)
A robust Initial Late Prehistoric occupation excavated at 41SP120 dates to between A.D. 1022
and 1209. Fish consumption was prolific, with human dietary needs supplemented by the hunting
and consumption of deer. Arrow points recovered at 41SP120 included triangular, Fresno-like
specimens. Further north within the coastal area, Scallorn arrow points have been found in
association with plain, sandy-paste pottery sherds. Although sandy-paste pottery appears to have
been manufactured during the earlier part of this sub-period, there is evidence to suggest that
decorated wares such as Rockport Black-on-Gray were a result of evolving pottery manufacturing
and design during the later centuries.
Final Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1250/1300 - 1700)
As with much of the rest of what we now know as Texas, the archaeological record in the Central
Texas Coast area reveals that the variety of chipped stone tools increased dramatically, and the
manufacturing of ceramic vessels in terms of quality, shape, and style changed significantly. These
changes demonstrated a marked advancement in tool production, and food storage and cooking
manufacturing technology, and further infer substantial changes in subsistence choices and
mobility patterns that occurred during this roughly 450-year period.
Chipped stone tools include smaller and presumably stream-lined arrow points such as the Perdiz
type, small unifacially flaked end scrapers, bifacially flaked knives, drills, and small prismatic
blades removed from blade cores. Pottery sherds found at period sites include those from bowls,
jars, and ollas which have been coated or decorated with asphaltum, and may have incised designs,
and even ceramic smoking pipes. Pottery types during the Final Late Prehistoric are named as
Rockport Incised, Rockport Crenelated, and Rockport Black-on-Gray; otherwise referred to as the
“Rockport Phase”. Remains found at Rockport Phase sites suggest the reliance of fish as a food
source probably reached its peak in prehistory, while the reliance on shellfish was largely
overshadowed.
There appears to be a non-discrete boundary between sites located close to the Gulf Coast
compared to those located roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) inland. At about that imaginary line,
Rockport pottery typical of shoreline occupations wanes, whereas bone-tempered pottery so
typical of Late Prehistoric Toyah occupations (e.g., Collins 2004; Hester 2004; Hester and Parker
1970; Black 1986) tends to be prevalent. It was during the latter part of this Final Late Prehistoric
sub-period when the bison became so much a predominate part of Toyah occupation, that the
reliance on bison herds also penetrated the imaginary 40-kilometer line west of the Gulf Coast,
along the riverine environs leading to the coast. For example, at the Mellon site (41RF21) in
Refugio County, bison and deer bones were found in association with Scallorn and Perdiz arrow
points, and Rockport pottery sherds.
Historic (ca. A.D. 1700-Present)
Although the coast of the Gulf of Mexico was charted by Spanish Captain Alonso Alvarez de
Pineda in 1520, perhaps the earliest white men to see this land area of Texas were Alvar Nuñez
Cabeza de Vaca, and two or three of his shipwrecked companions. De Vaca traversed parts of
20

southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the huntergatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). His stay with the Miriami in
1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves to the easily
exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally sending a hunting
party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live near each other in
the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other succulents (Campbell
and Campbell 1981:13-37). In addition, his diary speaks extensively of the ways of the Karankawa
Indians, a nomadic tribe that favored the modern site of the community of Refugio as a campsite
and eventual permanent village (Leffler 1996).
In 1722, the faithful Catholic fathers, with support from the Spanish Crown, established Mission
Señora del Espiritu Santo de Zúñiga in Goliad in an attempt to Christianize and otherwise
domesticate the Karankawas. Later, in 1793, Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio was founded at
the confluence of the Guadalupe and San Antonio rivers (Leffler 1996). However, Indian
depredations caused the location of this mission to be moved twice; the final site to be on the
Mission River in what is now modern-day Refugio. In 1830, the mission was closed, but by that
time Mexican ranchos surrounded the area.
In the early 1830s, colonists from Ireland, New York, and New Orleans were enticed to settle in
the area under empressario land contracts. During the Texas Revolution in 1835, residents of the
area were forced to flee to the east during the “Runaway Scrape”, and the Mexican town of La
Bahia was nearly destroyed.
Following the Civil War, the area’s economy was bolstered by cattle ranching and corn farming.
However, by 1900 the cattle industry had declined significantly. With the coming of railways in
the early 1900s, and a renewed cotton demand, cotton became the most predominate cash crop. In
the 1920s, oil and gas were discovered in the area, and although somewhat diminished by the Great
Depression, production of oil and gas in the area has been a mainstay, and today is on a springboard
driving the economy of Bee and Refugio counties.

Site Types to be Expected Along the Transco to Tennessee Pipeline
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Bee and Refugio counties are prehistoric open
campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure 3).
Some of these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have
camped for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large
groups of people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning
to these same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found
at these large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks
representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results
from making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from
terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells.
21

Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine environment
that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from
flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different food source
that could be exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas,
and agave hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze on the northern South
Texas Plains, and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that can be expected along the
Project Area. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that were left
behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The general absence
of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open campsites suggest that they
did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time ( However, small camp fires
may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make them more knappable). Yet,
they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural outcroppings or surface exposures
of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples of chipped stone most
commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two flakes removed, called ‘tested
cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the quality of stone that could most
easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether
it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior, then the cobble was tossed aside. That
is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites are of poor quality, coarse-grained
material. While the finished stone tool products are carried away from these sites, what remains are
those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces of debitage in the
form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large cobbles are present are
snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into
a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further reduce it and make finished stone tools from the
flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not found on these sites because they
have been carried off, presumably to areas of south Texas where raw material is not readily
available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use, so they are discarded and left
behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found on
any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops that
were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried today,
22

and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and lithic scatters in the
Karnes and Bee County areas have been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the
eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but differ
from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at times they
specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were not yet freed
from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types of sites are rare
in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not present themselves,
and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up gravels from the surface
than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone remains likely to be found at
these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as well as parent material detritus,
and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected. Although a handful of prehistoric
quarry sites have been recorded in south Texas, they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
There are no documented of burned rock middens in either Bee or Refugio counties. Burned rock
middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much like modernday roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the larger rocks
that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective as a thermal
source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable, another is
dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched out’ firecracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the
formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and
Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in south
Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites in both
upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, but the largest prehistoric cemetery
found in close proximity to the Project Area is 41LK28, in Live Oak County.
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology portion of this report, although Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th century, and Spanish entradas
began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no record of any sort of permanent
structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the area was generally not considered
safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers then began
establishing smaller ranches and farmlands (Bauer 1996; Leffler 1996).
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
south Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
23

most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within each of the two counties, the results simply provide the data that is available.
In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based upon the
types of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. To wit, a review of the
Texas Atlas indicated that there were no known archaeological sites within one mile of the Transco
to Tennessee Pipeline. The only survey conducted within one mile is shown in Figure 6, done in
1995 for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).
However, as shown in Figures 3 and 8, TAAI has conducted four other surveys within one mile,
all for privately funded pipelines. These were the NGL Header, the Silver Oaks to Transco, and the
NGPL to Tetco oil and gas lines. In sum, no archaeological sites were discovered along any of
these three right-of-ways within one mile of the proposed Transco to Tennessee Pipeline. A full
survey of the Choke Canyon Gas Line was not conducted, but at the request of the sponsor, TAAI
examined six river and creek crossings along that line; again, no archaeological sites were found
within one mile of the proposed Transco to Tennessee (Nickels 2012a-d).
That said, the data that is available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the areas of south Texas
that the surveys represent. Most of south Texas has never been subjected to formal cultural resource
surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the archaeological record is very poorly
understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished provide at least some
aspect of what the region looks like from an archaeological perspective.
Bee County
As of July 31, 2012 there were only 20 archaeological sites recorded within all of Bee County.
Despite the few numbers, a review of the projectile points that have been recovered from the 12
prehistoric open campsites indicates that Bee County has been occupied periodically through time
over the past 9,500 years. The best documented site in Bee County is 41BE2, the Berclair Terrace
Site, where deeply buried Paleoindian materials have been recovered in association with
Pleistocene fauna (Bousman et al. 2004; Hester 1977; Sellards 1940). Four prehistoric lithic scatters
have been documented in Bee County, along with five historic components; these being a circa
1880s lime kiln, the Gulf, Western Texas and Pacific Railway terminal, two early 1900s
farmsteads, and a 1900s trash scatter. Finally, the Bee County Courthouse in Beeville is listed as
a State Archaeological Landmark (Atlas 2012).
Refugio County
As of July 31, 2012 there were 140 archaeological sites recorded in Refugio County. Isolated
24

occurrences of Paleoindian points suggest that the Refugio County area has been occupied at to at
least some extent, over perhaps the past 11,000 years, and more permanent occupations have
occurred within the past 7,000 years. The remnants of prehistoric open campsites have been found
at 77 archaeological sites, and 46 sites have prolific quantities of discarded sea shells, so as to be
classified as ‘shell midden’ sites. In addition, 8 sites consist of predominately chipped stone debris,
with little or no fire-cracked rocks, or other evidence of prolonged habitation; accordingly, these
have been classified as lithic scatters. Rumors of prehistoric skeletal remains are common in the
Texas Coast area, and although according to the Texas Atlas only two are listed, prehistoric
cemeteries are probably to be encountered.
Historically, Refugio County is enriched with archaeological sites. These range from the National
Register’s Mission Refugio, to 1950s trash scatters. Those of note include: El Cópano Settlement,
with shell-crete building foundations and two cemeteries; the Plummer House and cemetery from
the 1800s; St. Mary’s of Aransas town site dating to the 20th century; possible site of the early
1800s Driscoll Inn; site of the “Mexican Watering Hole” with early 1930s ranch buildings; an early
1850s site that may have been the birthplace of Clara Driscoll; and others (Atlas 2012).

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical framework
is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the regions.
The historic framework is structured around the 1800s and 1900s settlement in the area as
documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests, government representatives, and
early Anglo-American settlers, through the Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty periods,
and into the Texas Statehood period. The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

25

Methods and Levels of Effort
The Survey
Generally, a nearly 100
percent pedestrian survey
was conducted, however, a
background review
conducted prior to the field
survey indicated that much
of the pipeline right-ofway was to pass through
upland areas where there
was at best a minimal
potential for deeply buried
and intact archaeological
deposits to exist, and on
tracts of land where access
by private landowners was
not yet granted. In that
regard, less than 2 percent
of the right-of-way was not
examined. Most segments
of the proposed pipeline
paralleled existing
pipelines. Surface visibility
ranged from 5 to 100
percent along the right-ofway. In some cases, the
proposed Transco to
Tennessee right-of-way
parallels an existing Koch
pipeline; in other cases, the
Transco to Tennessee will
cross through cultivated,
yet fallow fields (see for
example, Figures 18 and
19). Any artifacts observed
on the surface were to be
fully documented with
photographs, sketches, and
notes, then returned to the
surface.

west.

Shovel testing was
conducted in those areas deemed to be of moderate and high probability for buried archaeological
26

deposits, and where surface
visibility was less than 50
percent. Shovel tests were
dug in 20-cm levels, and all
sediments were screened
through 1/4-inch wire
mesh. Following our
designed research plan, any
artifacts recovered from
shovel tests were not to be
collected, but were to be
placed in the upper 20 cm
of the backfilled shovel
test. Particular attention
was given to approaches to
the many small and
ephemeral intermittent
drainage crossings, as well

Creek crossings. Cutbanks
were thoroughly examined, and shovel testing was conducted on the stepped terraces as determined
by the Project archaeologist in the field (see for example, Figure 20). Away from the creeks, the
many animal borrows and machine-bladed two-tracks were inspected for evidence of cultural
materials. The results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms, are on file at
TAAI, and can be made available upon request. A total of 92 shovel tests were excavated, and their
locations are shown in Figures 21-28.

Results of the Investigations
A thorough surface examination of approximately 98 percent of the 40-mile right-of-way was
conducted, with an assessment that the remaining roughly 2 percent offered little if any potential
for buried and intact archaeological deposits to exist. Surface visibility averaged approximately 70
percent, particular attention was paid to the numerous animal backdirt piles and stream cutbanks,
and 92 shovel tests were excavated on stream terraces. Caliche and fragmented sandstone bedrock
was extremely common, but most remarkably, archaeologists observed an extreme paucity of chert
or other raw materials appropriate for manufacturing stone tools along the entire length of the rightof-way. The only evidence of cultural material observed along the entire right-of-way was an
ephemeral open campsite along the west edge of Neddy Creek. That site (41BE25) is described
below.

32

41BE25
Description
41BE25 (Figures 29 and 30) is a
prehistoric lithic scatter and open
campsite of an unknown age,
consisting of chert debitage. It is
situated on a low, T-2 terrace on
the west edge of Neddy Creek, a
first-order tributary of Medio
Creek, a major drainage in Bee
and Refugio counties. A
previously existing pipeline
parallels the western edge of the
site. Otherwise, riverine large oak,

prevalent across the site. As such, surface
visibility ranged from 5-20 percent.
Surface elevation at the site ranges from
79-81 feet above mean sea level (amsl).
Soil on the site consists of Orelia fine
sandy loam.
Levels of Effort and Result
An inspection of the surface and the T-2
landform adjacent to Neddy Creek, as well
an artifacts found in two of six shovel tests
suggests that the site covers approximately
900 square meters (see Figure 30). The
only artifact discovered on the surface was
an interior bifacial manufacturing flake
made from tan, fine-grained, non-heated
chert. Two other interior bifacial
manufacturing flakes were found in two of
the six shovel tests between 0-10
centimeters below the surface These
artifacts suggest both middle and late stage
reduction activities occurred at the site.
The results of shovel testing generally
revealed pale brown sandy loam from 0-20
centimeters below the surface (cmbs)

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
41BE25 appears to be a relatively small open campsite occupied during an unknown period in
prehistory. The small variety of chipped stone suggests a temporary encampment along a small
tributary that was possibly spring-fed, or at least intermittently flowing at some time in prehistory.
In its current shallow contexts, other than its positioning on the landscape, the research value of this
site is considered to be minimal. Accordingly, we recommend that construction of the Transco to
Tennessee Pipeline as it is currently aligned be allowed to proceed as planned, with no further
archaeological investigations.

Summary , Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough surface examination of approximately 98 percent of the 40-mile right-of-way was
conducted, with an assessment that the remaining roughly 2 percent offered little if any potential
for buried and intact archaeological deposits to exist. Surface visibility averaged approximately 70
percent, particular attention was paid to the numerous animal backdirt piles and stream cutbanks,
and 92 shovel tests were excavated along the right-of-way. Caliche and fragmented sandstone
bedrock was extremely common, but most remarkably, archaeologists observed very few areas
where chert or other raw materials existed along the entire length of the right-of-way. The only
evidence of cultural material observed along the proposed right-of-way was on site 41BE25.
However, our assessment of 41BE25 is that it should be considered as non-significant.
As such, we recommend that construction of the Transco to Tennessee Pipeline should be allowed
to proceed as currently designed. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any
properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or
inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should be
allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds
are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and
by the Texas Historical Commission.
